Typically when my heart skips it’s either right before I get sick (because my body is fighting something), if I exercise too hard, or if my body is lacking a vitamin. I recommend taking multi-vitamins if you don’t. Especially magnesium. I take kelp (capsule with ground up kelp. You can get them on amazon or sometimes in grocery stores. Usually ten bucks a bottle). Kelp is high in magnesium and sometimes your body lacks that. I don’t know why, I don’t know how, but when my heart is racing (especially when trying to sleep, hate that) I take one or two kelp and it calms down with in 15 minutes. Your body might be responding to something it’s lacking especially for your period/ovulation. And you know I’m not a doctor so lol, If you feel you need a doctor or it gets worse do go and seek medical attention. But definitely check vitamins perhaps.

If you can afford not working for perhaps a few months then just go for it and find something else. My advice is to always have a job lined up before quitting, but I know that can be hard right know, but perhaps browse around for the next few weeks, see what you can get or if anyone contacts you, otherwise kiss the job goodbye.

What I’m saying is do your research and do your soul searching. When you completely, 100% seek God with all your heart, God reveals himself to you no matter who you are or where your walk is. There is evidence in science if you look up scholars who have dedicated their life to religion and science, you can do research there. There is evidence in testimonies. There’s a book about people dying and going to heaven (some even going to hell) and they talk about their experiences, it’s a book by John Burke. He takes thousands of testimonies and talks about them and they all back each other up. There is evidence in supernatural healing. If you are looking for pure on evidence that God just needs to drop from the sky and stand there in front of you, it’s not gonna happen like that. He reveals himself, his presence and his power to those who seek him for an answer on his existence. Do your research, do your soul searching."
Christianity,fpp09x4,t3_geqn3h,1588793713.0,"Research, dedication, time, and faith. When you have faith God begins to reveal himself. But it’s okay to do your research too. Find out every side, not just evolution but other religions too. My dad told me never to take his word for it but to make my own decision. 25 years old now and I have experienced and witnessed too much to deny God’s existence. I had depression for five years and I hated anything to do with the Bible and God and doubted his existence. I cried every day. I get it, I do, but you need to seek the Lord, get into his presence. The presence of God isn’t just a saying people say, it’s a real, tangible presence! When you get into his word, when you pray in tongues, when you worship, the Holy Spirit enters the room. It is a peaceful and loving presence. Seek the supernatural of God, you cannot deny his existence when you have the gifts of the spirit. Praying in tongues has completely shifted my life and I no longer doubt because it’s humanly impossible to pray in tongues unless God gives you the gift. 

I highly recommend you pray in tongues. Praying in tongues is a supernatural language between you and God and it is for any believer who has faith for it. This will get you into a deeper relationship with the Lord and will open many doors for other gifts. The more you pray in tongues the more you will get into the holy place with the Lord and feel his presence. It is super easy to get if you have faith for it. Your first step is to ask for it. Ask the Lord to baptize you in the Holy Spirit. Second step, start speaking! And not regular words, but random syllables. The Holy Spirit does not grab your tongue and make you speak. You have to offer him sounds for the Holy Spirit to attach himself to. Yes you will sound ridiculous at first, but you are stepping out in faith. And when you step out in faith that’s when he takes over and your random syllables will flow with supernatural words. It is a beautiful gift for any believer. I will leave a link that discusses more on tongues (and it’s what I used when I received the gift). It has changed my life spiritually forever. If you are sick of the dryness if religion, if you are sick of doubting, seek the supernatural. Healing exists, prophecy exists, tongues exists. God is real, and he wants you to take a step of faith and receive the things he has for you, to grow in a deeper and more intimate relationship with him.

Did you go to school for something and need to work in that field? Which in this case you need to narrow down your search with what states have better job opportunities for your field. Look into how much you’d be making in that state vs how much living is there. If you have a preference on governors, how the state is run, what type of climate you like, if you want to live in a city or a rural area.

NoStupidQuestions,fpmut8s,t1_fpmu0lv,1588742317.0,"Incest is just not normal nor should it be normalized. There should be separation between blood related family and romantic relationships with a partner.

Genetic mutation has to do with the genes since you’re both related coming from the same blood line. It can cause birth defects like blindness, deafness, heart defects etc. 

Wiki’s explanation: By inbreeding, individuals are further decreasing genetic variation by increasing homozygosity in the genomes of their offspring. Thus, the likelihood of deleterious recessive alleles to pair is significantly higher in a small inbreeding population than in a larger inbreeding population."

The reason is because factories shut down for a few days/weeks (I think majority are up now) but the demand for meat is higher than what they can get out (less workers as well due to people not wanting to work or getting sick etc.)You also have farmers and places not being able to send their produce or live stock to these factories and restaurants. Can’t take care of the live stock so they have to kill them all and throw out the meat. Can’t do anything with the produce so they just let it rot and get rid of it. 

I think what really hurt us was people panic buying. They couldn’t keep up the demand. And some people are panic buying again with the meat which is just making it worse. It’s okay to buy bulk but I wouldn’t go crazy. Things will eventually go back to normal. Trump did sign an executive order to protect our meat industry and keep things open.

It doesn’t matter if it sounds horrible, if it sounds corny etc. because you will always need to go back and fix this stuff later. If things sound too obvious you can always change it up or, you can always leave it obvious. Sometimes obvious can be the best way to get your point across.

Those who have God will always have forgiveness and the holy spirit will convict us, but those who don’t accept Jesus don’t have this grace. 

There are those who live in sin; never turning away from it, don’t care whether it’s “sin” or not, don’t care about the consequences. They sin and don’t care about God or they know of God yet serve two masters. You can’t serve sin and God at the same time. Which is why we must have a change of heart toward sin. We must repent and know that it is bad to sin but when we fall, get tempted and mess up God is gracious to forgive us and we won’t turn back to that sin. That we will strive to do and be better.

Sure enough, he talked to the one he didn’t want and the next time he time traveled, they wanted to leave. I feel like the higher you get your friendship with someone the more likely they are to leave because it’s kind of like you “fulfilled” their requests/desires. 

You can definitely get rid of anyone, but it just really depends how the game does it. If you time travel to a day that someone wants to leave, keep that specific date in mind. When you go to the present and time travel back to that specific date that someone wanted to leave, there should always be at least one person that wants to leave, because it will switch to someone else.

depression,fp2rqwx,t3_gaznst,1588266793.0,"I used to be the same with writing. Loved writing my stories. Used to stay up to 3-4 in the morning writing because I loved it so much. Until depression hit and took that drive away. I recently got back into it because I realized that I honestly didn’t want anything else in life other than to become a writer. I tried going into the medical field, I tried dead end jobs, I hated it all. If I was gonna sit home and be depressed then I might as well do something about it. Although I have taken a bit of a break with everything going on, but as soon as things get back to normal I’m doing it. 

My advice, set small goals. Do art in parts just to get it done. I set a goal for writing a certain amount of words a day, so maybe set yourself a goal. Try to get back into it. I know depression gives you no drive but if you are strict on your goals then you could potentially push yourself to do it again. Rekindle that passion. Look at other art and just do it! Push yourself to your limits. Even when I was down about reading other’s books thinking I’ll never become anything, I push it aside!! I have come to realize that depression was keeping me away from what I was truly meant to do in life.

AskWomen,fp2my6i,t3_gayvqb,1588264507.0,"So I used to get TERRIBLE razor burn every time I shaved until I used “Cremo moisturizing shave cream” I use lavender but there are other scents. You can get it at most stores or online. You wet your legs with warm/hot water for 30 seconds, apply it on (it’s like soap basically) then shave, and it prevents razor burns and cuts (although I always seem to cut myself no matter what). But this prevents me from getting terrible razor burn and burning legs after shaving. That and using a good razor, don’t use cheap ones. I use Hydro silk razor and that seems to do fine with me. Regular shaving cream or things like soap never helped with razor burns except for the cremo cream. I definitely recommend that."

They will either say there’s no room and will choose someone at random (they will tell you who) to get to move out so they can move in (only when you have max villagers though). If you JUST put the plot down when he was in the campsite, I am wondering if that is why you can’t convince him because maybe you needed the plot up before he came, but I can’t be too positive about this. You should be able to keep speaking with him until he stays. You have to just keep mashing the button till he says something new lol"

I have yet to really hear anything bad about time travel, especially one day of time travel (typically time travel of months or years would do something). It sounds like the game just didn’t register you wanted to move something. The best I can suggest is first close out the application, then go back to your present time, see if your house is still being moved and your thing being demolished. If it is then you can try again and move a day ahead. If not, perhaps the game didn’t save properly when you did it. Unfortunately bugs like that could definitely happen :|"

The answer, love. Love is what made him stay up there. The love for you. He does not want anything but to get to know him more and love him in return."

What we do know is that God is all knowing, he is just and he is love. What we can assume is that he has seen everything that will happen and he has seen the end results to what is to come out from all this evil and knew it was all worth it in the end. He could have destroyed all of mankind and even the devil and started new, but he didn’t because he saw you, he saw me, he saw all of us. And if things didn’t happen the way they did we wouldn’t be here, we wouldn’t exist. People have choices and hell is a just punishment for sin. He doesn’t want people to go there but everyone who does knows exactly why they are there. They rejected Jesus and followed sin. Although we do not know why God has allowed certain things to happen, and that is an answer we all want to know, we know that the end result is love. Because he loves us and good does come out from suffering. Good always triumphs over evil."

Other than that, you can time travel and it doesn’t affect anything but I wouldn’t time travel in the beginning only because you kinda lose the fun of it. I didn’t time travel until I could terraform but it’s up to you!! You do whatever you have fun with!

AskReddit,fouoarr,t3_g9omcv,1588087646.0,"I don’t know what you believe in, who you are, what caused your depression, why you feel the way you do, but I will tell you how I personally beat depression. I got sucked into depression for five long dark years. Mostly after graduating high school and not knowing what I wanted to do with my life. I had depression to the point of wanting to hurt myself, I hated life, I wanted to die. I’d cry every night, I didn’t think anyone loved me. I had absolutely no friends. Yeah I had a good life with good parents but I was depressed and I never knew why. I didn’t want to leave the house, I didn’t like going anywhere with depression. And I NEVER used to be like that in school, I used to be a happy chipper person. Listen, it took me a long time and me avoiding countless conversations about it to realize what was causing my depression. 

I am a Christian and when I had depression and was a Christian you get all sorts of people telling you things and I didn’t even want to hear it. “Christians can’t be depressed” “oh just get in the word.” I started having doubts about my faith. People say everyone has a purpose by God and I thought to myself if I killed my self right now there would be no purpose. I used to cry out to God why I felt the way I did, I didn’t want to live anymore. That is, until I realized what was giving me depression, the devil. And I was feeding into the problem. I found out that depression was a way for the devil to keep you captive so you couldn’t do anything with your life, so you couldn’t find the joy of Lord, to keep you locked in from the very thing that God had a calling on your life for. Even once I found this out, it was still a battle. I started speaking in tongues after this (prayer between you and God, and any Christian can get it if you step out in faith for it https://youtu.be/z1UGsLt6Z_E). After speaking in tongues I really felt like my depression had lifted from me from the most part because speaking in tongues for me was such a spiritual and holy evidence that God existed that anything that I was feeling left me. It took half a year though to be better. I’d go to bed depressed and get wicked nightmares. There it was again. I opened myself back up to depression and the devil took a ride of my mind. I would get nightmares all the time when I went to bed depressed after that. I kept feeding to the devil. The devil comes to kill, steal, and destroy which is with ANY sickness, illness, depression, anxiety. One day I said enough was enough. I wasn’t going to feed into the lies anymore and ever since then I never had depression. I ultimately was the one giving myself depression and encouraging the devil. Now I know that I am loved, I do have purpose, and there is more to life than depression. 

I don’t know who you are, I don’t know what you believe in, I don’t know your situation. Depression sucks, suicide sucks. I wouldn’t wish it upon anyone, but there is a God, Jesus, who died on the cross for your sins and anyone who calls upon his name shall be saved; he is real and he loves you so much. Do not let the devil take another minute from you wallowing in your depression. Stand up for yourself mentally. I believed the lie too “it’s not that easy with depression, I can’t just stop being depressed.” You can with the Lord. You can’t on your own and that’s the difference. 

Other than that, start giving your mind positive things. Look in the mirror and tell yourself you are loved, you have worth and you are going to do something great today! There is power in your words and your mind. Whatever you meditate on comes out your mouth, so meditate on good things and your thought process and words will change. If you sit and think in depression every day you will be just that, depressed. 

I encourage you to seek the Lord, my friend. He loves you and he is waiting for you to reach out to him. Only then will he reveal himself and heal you of everything you need :)"

Christianity,fob20db,t3_g6nyj2,1587655208.0,"I have always struggled with this in the past and you are not alone when it comes to this. You say you have experienced God but have you truly experienced the presence of God because once you feel the presence of God you will definitely not have anymore doubts afterwards because his presence is a supernatural thing. I highly recommend people to speak in tongues. Speaking/praying in tongues is for any believer who has faith for it, it is a supernatural language between you and God. You can worship in tongues and get in the prayer closest and pray. This opens the doors to the lord’s presence, the more you practice it and pray and the more the lord will show himself to you. Now people will argue that tongues is not for today or it’s only for the elites preachers or whatever. This is not true. The Bible talks about speaking in tongues and encourages it. The verse that people get hung up when it says don’t speak without an interpreter, the Bible is referring to during preaching. You don’t speak in tongues during service as a sermon because no one knows what you are saying and it won’t get anyone saved and most people would walk out the door thinking you are crazy, thus you need an interpreter if you use tongues for preaching. This does not mean you can’t speak tongues while worshiping or praying as a church or individually. If you want to interpret your own tongues you need to seek the Lord and he can give you the ability to interpret your own tongues. But speaking in tongues is the perfect prayer being told out your mouth, you are speaking the perfect will of God which is why it’s so important to know because we as humans only know so much but we don’t know what to pray for but our spirit man and God knows. 

It’s for anyone who is a Christian.  I started speaking in tongues and my entire perspective changed about God. I no longer had doubts because speaking in tongues is not humanly possible without God giving it to you. (This also healed me of depression that I was stuck in for five years) Speaking in tongues is very easy, and all you need is faith. That’s it. You ask the Lord to baptize you in the holy spirit. If you do that, your next step is to start speaking!! Yes you need to step out in faith and offer up sounds and syllables to the Holy Spirit to take over. He does not take control of your tongue randomly or force your tongue to move. YOU need to first make the sounds as you step out in faith then the Holy Spirit will fill your syllables with what he wants you to say. You need to speak baby talk, not human words but syllables and sounds like a baby. You will sound completely foolish at first like why am I doing this, am I doing this right, and then BAM you start speaking fluently, in control, and supernatural words. It’s like a car engine, you need to turn the key to get the car started. Same with tongues. You need to offer up noise for the Holy Spirit to attach himself. I wish everyone would take a chance and get tongues because no one would have doubts anymore and your prayer language would be unstoppable! You never run out of things to pray for with tongues. I will leave a few videos below to help you which helped me understand how to get it, and explained a bit more. But I encourage you to seek the Lord and ask for the gift of tongues. We all go through doubts, it is normal but I’m telling you, your whole life will change once you start getting into the supernatural of God. He is real, he is alive, and he wants to get into a deeper relationship with you, so go into your room and watch some of these videos. 

Person who got the gift and also experienced it/shows you what it sounds like it. Every tongue is different and some sound slightly different but it’s all the same and your tongues will develop as you practice it: https://youtu.be/vsrwgd7rnR0
