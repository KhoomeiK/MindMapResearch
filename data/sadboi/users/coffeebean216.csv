depression,fqd0cqg,t3_g9ndgw,1589275211.0,"I stopped living at around 16. I'm 22 right now, but I cannot for the life of me recall what all I've done in the past 6 years. Everyone I meet assumes that I'm still in school; my parents are always telling me that I stopped growing after school (jokingly of course) but it's never funny to me because it's actually true."
