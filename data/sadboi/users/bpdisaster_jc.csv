BPD,fn1p9fz,t3_fyh7we,1586566955.0,"I relate to this SO much, and I feel for you! What makes it even weirder for me personally is that I also have avoidant personality disorder. I’ve been isolating myself as much as I can for 7-8 years. In that time I can count the actual friends I had total on one hand lol. Even though I’m the one that’s isolating myself, seeing people talk about their healthy and happy friendships and romantic relationships always hits a nerve with me. I just can’t have what they have, and no matter how much I tell myself I’m better off alone, I tear up (or just straight up start bawling) with certain posts. Just little digs that keep adding up day after day."
BPD,fkmudjz,t3_fjgdhu,1584340417.0,"Oof I can definitely relate to this. I currently don’t have any friends so I’m not in the same boat at the moment. But I’ve had that happen to me multiple times, where I let in another friend, we become a group of three, and then they end up being best friends and I’m cut out. It’s a horrible, horrible experience, and I’m so sorry you went through that as well."
