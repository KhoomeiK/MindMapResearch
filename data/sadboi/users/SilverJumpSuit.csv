MentalHealthSupport,f7xramz,t3_dxzgk1,1574071237.0,"Honestly man, I understand some of what you mean. I’m in high school too(senior) I’m not diagnosed with anything so believe me or not whatever, I’m always having trouble with my mental health and it’s been like this since as far back as I can remember and with more school and working life has just been a roller coaster but the only thing that get’s me out of bed everyday is just, knowing that I have to be better and make others happier, I’ve been really leaning on my one best friend and my last year teacher. My teacher has been the most help since we’ve started to just email each other, but anyways I just think you should find one person(doesn’t matter who) and just lean on them"
