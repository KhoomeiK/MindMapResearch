As somebody who's looked into immigrating to Canada with it's point system - that one awards points based on your degree, work expierence, English and French language ability, whether you studied in Canada or have previously worked in Canada. Provinces can nominate people based on what skills they need and that adds a huge amount of points to your application. You get points for having a job offer, but you don't need one to apply. It means that people who have skills that are needed in Canada can apply for a visa, and if they get one, can then move to Canada and look for a job.

- The EU - The European Union, a union of 27 countries in Europe.

So I live on the coast, and at the very end of the seafront, once you've walked down the length of the seafront, theres a long mental pole you can kick. Theres a load of theories as to why people do thos, but one, kinda relevant one is that in the 1920's there was an outbreak of tuberculosis here. People would walk up and down the seafront, and at the very end, theres a ""bar"" that people kick here. Kicking the bar would supposedly ensure that you stayed well. 

I have kicked the bar a few times since the outbreak, and I dont have covid. So maybe theres something to it."
