It doesn’t matter what she’s mad at, or what you say, if she’s upset, she will scream, insult you, and you’ll more than likely be slapped, punched, thrown around, occasionally kicked, and/or pushed into things.

An example of this would be the time when I asked my brother to clean his room (which she asked me to do) and in response, he got upset and broke a bookshelf, and she got angry with me for upsetting him, and kicked my leg, left a bruise, pushed me down, and screamed at me for 10 minutes about how miserable I make her.

She does this to all of my siblings, and sometimes, even my father. Her anger is not only unmanaged and a complete overreaction to pretty much any situation she finds herself in, but it’s almost always misplaced in other people who aren’t even responsible for whatever it was that made her upset.

She is always making us feel guilty for all of her “pain” and anger, and has, on many occasions, threatened to kill her self, exclaiming that it’s our fault that she hates her life and wants to die.

That’s emotional AND physical abuse. Now, stop being a prick and undermining other’s experiences. Just because you were so fortunate as to not have experienced these things doesn’t mean no one else has to endure them.

She’s also the same one to taunt and make up lies about every guy in the house. When I was younger, all up until a few years ago, she’d hit me, punch me, throw me around, kick me, scream at her maximum capability, throw things AT me, all the while telling me that I deserve it.

Sometimes it’ll be over things I had nothing to do with. Other times, it’d be because one of my sisters or my brother would do something dumb and blame it on me. When I’d refute, she’d always reply with about the same thing; “All men are liars”. I don’t know why. SHE is the one who abuses her husband, so I don’t know where she even gets it from.

No one ever wants to take the time to listen to what I have to say. I had a friend who would come to me for help with everything, and my advice would always be effective. But if I tried to talk about my issues, she’d just suddenly stop contacting me for up to several days, come back, and pretend the conversation never even happened.

EDIT; ok, a few things for all the replies I’ve just gotten back to;

1: Yes, I still live with her. I’m 16.

2: Yes, I’ve already told child protective services about these issues. The problem is; my siblings are too afraid to rat her out to them, in fear of what her response might be.

3: My parents are not divorced, but they’ve come close on several occasions.

4: Most of these actions stopped about 2 years ago, but she still does it to my younger siblings. She’s already learned that I fight back.

I hope this helps, but I’m busy, so I have to get all the answers out in one edit. I’ll check back later. As far as my friend goes, I’m not certain of what I should do."

I got to the point where I couldn’t hear anything and my vision started going hazy and blurry, before I heard myself gasp out of instinct, before even realizing that I was finally able to breathe again. No one noticed me crawling, choking, or flailing.

It felt like one of those moments where I started to lose trust in my family. They were never a kind bunch to me, but this made me feel like they weren’t concerned for my safety.
