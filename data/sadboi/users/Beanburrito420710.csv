BipolarSOs,fmodlzy,t3_fw9dja,1586255090.0,"Very good, thank you for telling me your point without negating mine. You made some very good points as well. I think it can be helpful for some people with Bipolar and not so helpful for others. 

I also think the abuse shouldn't be a footnote to this guy smoking weed: it should be the main problem. The unhealthy focus OP is putting on that and not the abuse will make it harder to be understood and get help.
 
I think we should all agree right now though: I guarantee you no one is getting psychosis from CBD, and I guarantee you NO ONE has ever been harmed from CBD. The poster doesn't really seem to understand that CBD does not make you ""high"" in any way, shape or form and it often comes from hemp."
BipolarSOs,fmo8u3a,t3_fw9dja,1586249763.0,"Weed doesn't make people pull out a knife on their mother. Maybe meth. This man is simply abusive. Weed just doesn't give people that reaction. 

I have people very close to me who medicate with cbd/marijuana for bipolar and they are all better people for it. I even know people with brain damage/bipolar mixed and they would not be able to function without it. 

By focusing on the marijuana and not the fact that he is abusive, you are undermining your own point and coming off a little ridiculous. Stop complaining about him smoking weed, which harms no one, and start complaining about the fact he is abusive. 

If he wants to use marijuana to fix his disorder he has the right to, there is nothing inherently wrong with it. He does not however, have the right to be abusive. 

Also keep in mind, there is no possible way AT ALL that marijuana could STOP his brain from healing. That is absolutely ridiculous and if you can find even one example of peer reviewed and verified research that supports your claim then I'll concede that point. Keep in mind as well that doctors run a spectrum in 2020. Some are for marijuana as a medicine and some are against. If you get one who is against it, it doesn't matter that they are a DOCTOR. They will ignore any possibility of it having medical value based on their own beliefs, and many doctors get offended at the very idea of someone self medicating and are against any form of it even if it is helpful."

depression,fe0ckbf,t1_fe0bgdn,1578809835.0,"I still do feel this way. But I try to remember that leaving isn't the answer. I romanticized it. Maybe it's ""The Good Place""! I thought. But the truth is you can't look forward to that because while death will stop any bad things from happening to you, it also stops the chances of any good things happening. 

The biggest trap here is that you are comparing your goals and improvements to your peers. That's why I deleted all social media and I set goals that would make ME happy. Not what society has told me, not what has made others happy or what they are achieving. 

Does it make me sad looking at my peers with a Tesla at 23 knowing I'll never drive? Yes. But then I think "" Well I don't need to do that. I'm gonna be rich some day and I'll have a driver. Until then, Lyft it is! "" 

There is so many things that I am behind my peers on. So many that I would make a fool of myself even listing. But then I just ""reclaibrate"" my goals to be realistic to me. Small things. Then once those small things that are adjusted to me start to fall into place it's amazing how the big things started working out. 

Stagnation happens. Sometimes we don't move forward. And all it means of you feel like that is that it hasn't happened for you yet. Which means you have something to look forward to. Because it WILL happen. The only way it won't is if you stop trying or die. And that's just a fact. 

I hope some of this helped and is more than the usual motivational regurgitated stuff you hear from people who have never been to that place where death seems like a good option."

depression,fe0c2uu,t1_fe08l8e,1578809318.0,"I understand that completely. Life is just an endless cycle of work until death unless you get lucky enough to have passive income and that existential dread causes a lot of people to be sad, it's a mass problem with the I hereby way society functions. But at the very least, look at the positive of HAVING that income. Look forward to what you find repetitive. Find ways to spice it up. Because some people on this very forum are depressed because they can't find a job, and I've been in that boat. Without that, things get worse. Real bad real fast and all hope leaves. I know the surreal feeling you are talking about, that strange kind of calm feeling when you realize you are actually going to do it. But I implore you, please dont. Keep at the job, use Tinder if you dont. I don't have the nice cars, although I wish I did. I have epilepsy and will never be able to drive. But I don't let that get me down. I'll do Uber or Lyft or maybe someday get myself a driver of I'm successful enough. I try to think like that about stuff I don't have or won't get. Why are you worried the scars on your wrist will get you in trouble or make you lose your job? I've always proudly displayed my scars and I don't think it has made people look at me like you are worried about. Once you start displaying them proudly and your body without worry a certain sense of clarity will wash over you. Like you survived something. Here's the point you cut the ties and realize things aren't going as planned, and this is a harsh truth but: when you're happy. Because that happiness will no doubt be a result of something you didn't plan and that's the beauty of life. You don't need the girl, or the house or the dream job. You just need to find the best things YOU can achieve and thank whatever deity for them every chance you get. Next time you go to work, keep a running monologue in your head and try to make it like a TV show. That always worked for me. And also think about the fact that many people, myself included would kill just for that job you have. Thank you for your kind words and I hope there is something in here that helps you."

That landed me at Unit 5940 at United Hospital in Saint Paul after being resuscitated and saved (they even used those shock paddle things on me) which changed my life. . . Stayed for a month, met my first kiss there and made lifelong friends I still keep to this day. It's funny because one of the reasons I went in was my inability to attract the opposite sex and then where I finally had success with that was when I was basically just going through life because I expected it to end. 5940 saved my life. There's a whole TV show in that experience.

ABOUT US:

We have been working on dropping, producing, and promoting our mixtape Smoke Alarm for over a year now. Our Group is called IC BOI (Pronounced ""Icey Boy""). The group is formed from me (Alex Wolf, lead singer, guitar, Oriented towards pop, indie and classic rock but I love rap too) And my legit, actual, real brother Noah (rap oriented, as well as indie with a unique flow and lyricism) 

Noah goes by Nissa, and Riley, our third member (Oriented towards electronic/classic rock) is a savant of producing, synthesizer and music theory. But he doesn't go by ""Riley"" he goes by ""Mr.E"" when we're making music

Smoke Alarm is what happened when the three of us decided to combine our talents and tastes to form a new kind of meld between indie, rap and psychidelic. And that's our ultimate goal: making music that ha s mass appeal whilst not compromising on intense obsession with creative integrity and without taking away the things that make indie or rap good by themselves. I usually write the melodies.

If you like rap, indie, pop or psychedelic gather round and come listen. That's what we're trying to cultivate. We have poured blood, sweat, and tears, into this  mixtape to show people what We can do, get labels interested, and maximize our abil ity to create new and interesting takes on popular music, then re-release an album containing these tracks and others under a label to give them the attention they deserve."
