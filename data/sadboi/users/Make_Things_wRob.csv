They're heavy duty and are rated to hold (per PAIR) 225lbs.

As for wood to lay on it those shelves, you can get away with melamine as long as you don't space the shelves too far apart.  16"" apart, no problem, 24"" apart, starts getting risky.  If I were doing what you want to do, I'd use the melamine and add a lip to the front of it (attaching a 2"" piece perpendicularly on the end)."
