My mom had to do that with our scale for awhile. I won't lie: I got snoopy at first, but then after awhile I simply gave up. I found it helped a lot in the long run"

So is is an awesome post - thanks so much! I've quickly grown to like the Safeway in the Sherwood Park Mall too. They seem to have some decent deals, and it wasn't too long ago that I found family-sized chicken breasts for like $3.99/lb (compared to $8.99-ish/lb). You better believe I had a raging savings-boner from it. One other thing that's really awesome is they accept Airmiles - which I've also *really* gotten into looking for since co-habitating. 


I understand there's still going to be some downfalls shopping at Safeway compared to other grocery stores, but at least for now I'm happy there!"
