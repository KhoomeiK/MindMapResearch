Or... a lawyer in general for that matter. 

It just strikes me as odd that the lamictal 400mg has never been an issue for me before. Granted, I know that 400mg is generally the max dose the prescribe (as a mood stabilizer anyway) 
My prescriber is also kind of a quack but my insurance is pretty limiting for my area, so there's that as well."

BipolarReddit,f82l6lw,t1_f82k22v,1574193377.0,"So before trying this, along with the 400mg lamictal my doctor prescribed me 5mg abilify. 
The side effects were similar, but so much worse. I might as well have been braindead when taking it (I took it for maybe a week then stopped)

I'd try antipsychotics, and I know it sounds stupid but I'm so terrified of weight gain that I just kind of refuse to do so (another reason he suggested trying trileptal)

Any experiences with antipsychs that didn't have that side effect? Because I don't think I've heard of anything. 
Again, I know that's a stupid reason but I don't think I could handle the self image issues that would arise. 

Also, 99% sure I've got add or adhd comorbid. Runs in the family."

A peer group is nice in thought, but as far as my office goes, there are about 12 other technicians, all of which I've worked with. 

My hr department is actually fantastic, and they would take a mention like that seriously, but, at the same time they're very aware of what type of employees the company has and what their general behavior / language is. Unlike your ex, I don't partake in their shitty jokes, general gross statements about women (that's a constant) or really any of that. That's probably where half of the problem lies, lol. Regardless of whether or not I rat on a specific person, the end result would be the same. I'm a worker who needs to be coddled, and my appearance within the company would be tarnished further. The supervisors were technicians up until recently, so you can imagine they're cut from the same cloth. 
End game I'll have to leave this company in hopes of finding another. But I'll be stuck in one trade or another, with probably the same result. Hard to switch fields without proven experience (none aside from a couple of years of retail/sales before I turned 18)

I'd call HR, but that would be a bad move in my line of work. 

For instance: I recently told my supervisor that someone they had just fired had called me a faggot in the past. I hadn't mentioned anything previously, because my word against his, and his tenure being 5x mine, I feared for my job.
