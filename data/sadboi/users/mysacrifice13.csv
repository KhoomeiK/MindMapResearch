Tekken,fp2pa9m,t1_fp1bak3,1588265612.0,Makes sense. what would you call bad habits?
depression,fovfp1e,t3_g9ndgw,1588100532.0,Yup. It waa around 15 when it hit me too
tinnitus,foewhke,t3_g74qxg,1587717210.0,"Also played some music in the work truck and drove around with the windows down on a windy day but like that's literally it. No alarms, unexpected bangs, nothing out of the normal. Are me ears THAT sensitive ? And if so what caused it?"
tinnitus,fo6gmxi,t1_fo62w1b,1587558256.0,"Wow, this thing is such a mystery"
tinnitus,fo5sv52,t3_g5u50u,1587534616.0,"Sounds exactly like a first timer. Well what can I say? It hits some of us worse than others. I for one had it since childhood, forgot about it for YEARS, then had a recent spike last night (which is why I'm here). It's a very mysterious condition. Recovery is... meh. Some recover some don't BUT there are ways to cope. I suggest probably the most fundamental and yet hardest part is not stressing over it. Try to focus on your thoughts, breathing, all the good things in life. Eventually it will sink into the background and you'll barely even notice it. That's kinda what I did the first time. I don't really know how to handle this spike but I might get on some anti anxiety medication and sleep medication also. I'm not really trying to waste too much time on a ""eh"" condition but more on leaning towards actually living this time. If I can just get some good rest. Anyways, it's annoying but as long as you can sleep. You'll be alright. Wish I could do more bud."
