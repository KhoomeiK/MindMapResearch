At the same time - your daughter is probably a teenager, and teenagers have a tendency to be brats. You should be the adult here and try to have a productive conversation with her soon if you want to save your wallet and your kid's future.

First, see if her displeasure with her major is something that can be addressed. Is she struggling with her CS classes? See if there's another tech-related major that she may be more interested in. 

Is she feeling isolated in a male-dominated field? See if there's an organization for women in STEM that you can point her to - this would also be a good networking opportunity!

Is she simply struggling emotionally? Point her in the direction of campus counseling services and tell her how to get involved and make friends on campus.

If that doesn't work, see if there's a reasonable compromise that fits your both your wishes. Would she like to minor in liberal arts instead of changing majors? Would you be willing to pay for a liberal arts-adjacent major that leads to a specific career field, such as public relations, advertising, technical communications, social work, etc.?

Finally, if your daughter refuses to respect your boundaries and continues demanding that you pay for a liberal arts major, put your foot down but reassure her that you love her. Tell her that you'd be happy to walk her through the process of taking out a student loan that she can pay back later.
