fordexpedition,fo8u4i4,t3_g58nk3,1587603882.0,So yay!!!! Finally discovered the reason for my frustration! Pulled out the old radiator and replaced it. Test drive. Victory Dance. Game. Set. Match.
fordexpedition,fo8jpkl,t3_g58nk3,1587597888.0,Jeeeeeesssuuuuussss! So replaced the water pump. Test drive. Overheat. F*$@. Cuss a few times. Kick the tires. Take a breath. Fine. I'll just replace the radiator then. Everybody pray for me as I will NOT be conquered. Lol.
fordexpedition,fo5dcnb,t1_fo5cyrx,1587522952.0,Changed the thermostat today. No joy. So I am also now believing it's water pump. I started to try to take it out. It's being a turd sniffer. Ran out of light. Will continue tomorrow. I will fix this bish. Lol! It will not defeat me.
fordexpedition,fo3khrb,t3_g58nk3,1587488417.0,"Edit: So an update. I used the cooling pressure kit. The pressure in the cooling system is not leaking. Okay good. Doing a back flush, and replacing thermostat and lower radiator hose. I am thinking maybe the hose is pinching?!"
fordexpedition,fo38gv9,t3_g58nk3,1587482495.0,"Okay. I did check the serpentine. It's correct according to the manual. It overheated steam came through hood towards the cab. Reservoir was dry. Because coolant was now on the ground. I put water in it to try to see where it was coming out. I couldn't tell. I thought it maybe that I wiggled the radiator hose when I put the compressor back in. So I rechecked the belt and the hoses, tightened the hoses. Tried again. Still losing the water in the reservoir. So I went to the tail pipe and noticed the moisture. Oil is clean. No cloud out of the exhaust. In the process of using a coolant pressure check kit. Still not wanting to have a head casket problem."
fordexpedition,fo2q0k0,t1_fo2a712,1587471037.0,I just want to know if it might be a head gasket or something I did changing the A/C. I'm also a girl so...Lol. I guess I did ramble.

It is good that you found an outlet for peace in this chaos. Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, and Pewds have also helped me in the aftermath of my loss. I thought I was literally going to lose my mind. On a night I started to attempt suicide I came across Jack's playlist of The Boss videogame. I laughed, I cried, and I grieved. But...I lived. Now Septic Sam is part of the semicolon on my wrist. We grieve, but somehow....we live."
