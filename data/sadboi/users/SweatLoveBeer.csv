ptsd,foqk4n0,t3_g8y4jf,1587995348.0,">I often don't feel like life is real or that my brain is foggy. I always  feel like I look at the world through a lens or a screen. I often  question my own existence. Sometimes I look at the mirror and don't  really recognize myself or forget that I look a certain way. Often  asking myself if life is a dream and also finding difficulty to  differentiate my real life and my dreams when I wake up.

This absolutely correlated to PTSD - dissociative disorders have a very high comorbility rate. I was diagnosed with PTSD and DDS and it absolutely 100% stems from my trauma. I feel just like you. Looking at my hands and not understanding ""why life is like that"", sometimes feeling like ""life is just waiting for time to pass, really"" or looking in the mirror and not ""seeing"" myself or looking completely different from how I think I look like ""inside myself"". All of this - and more - is 100% my jam. 

I learned how to cope with it in therapy. I was really surprised to find that my therapists thought my DDS was a real problem: After all, I felt like it helped myself not be miserable. But DDS is just being in denial with life and thus has to be treated before you treat the PTSD. 

**What helps me the most** is ""sense shocks"" that send me back to reality: I have smellings tubes of angelika root, pure vanilla and amonia drops on a cloth inside a sealable plastic-tube. I have pickle-juice ice cubes that I'll take in my mouth. I go to my balcony and put my hands on the cold concrete. Anything to shock my out of my mind space into ""body space"". 

What also helps me, especially if I feel like I'm in danger of flashbacks or ""memory reality"" where I (involuntarily) remember things of my past so vividly that I'm losing touch with reality is loudly stating what day and what time it is, where I am and what I am doing. 

Absolutely tell your therapists that you're struggling with those symptoms! I would have never thought they were serious business, but it is."

ptsd,fod9p7a,t1_fod7w5c,1587681992.0,"That's so interesting! I have, luckily, not had to experience stigma around PTSD, probably I have a trauma that people ""understand"" (childhood sexual abuse). When I was in-group, I remember that one person had a really rough time since people didn't validate her trauma from emotional abuse, which I think is the biggest problem with PTSD I've encountered relating to stigma."
ptsd,fod4ktx,t1_fod32tj,1587679791.0,"The question isn't weird at all! 

I don't think people are looking for a BPD or DD diagnosis at all that much, actually. The stigma around BPD is absolutely horrible, while borderline mainly is just an emotion management disorder, there is still a lot of people thinking if you have BPD you are ""a crazy person"". I've heard the BPD community talk about people romantising BPD and self-diagnosing for a ""manic pixie dream girl"" vibe, but I've personally not encountered that at all.

I think very little people know about dissociation / derealisation (I didn't until I found out that it's not normal to not feel real sometimes), so there's very little self-diagnosing there."

Then I got new memories from my trauma. Started dreaming about it constantly, started having flashbacks and intrusive thoughts so often that it really messed with my perception of reality. When memories feel so physically real, when you dreams are 1:1 your memories, it makes distinguishing reality harder. 

Luckily I had a stunning experience at half-stationary therapy, they really caught me."
