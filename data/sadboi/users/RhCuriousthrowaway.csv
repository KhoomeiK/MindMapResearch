Edit: it's good to be polite, do job, go home. Don't have to make friends, but we(the CNAs w/ nasty attitude especially) should still be polite because it's a hard job."

Just gotta be confident in your intentions and skill.

I was the same way, I have the highest grades and I was motivated to quit all of those things and I did, but what I was left with was no hobbies and even though I was proud of myself I developed a creeping depression that turned into anxiety (not saying this will be your experience). You're young and as long as your hobbies aren't hurting anymore don't forget to keep some for yourself. Good luck figuring yourself out."
Nurse,ezea9nx,t3_d0vipv,1567861265.0,"I'm not a nurse, so I dont have the same knowledge as you. I'm a CNA and during my time I saw a lot of ""grey area"" things. As a person who wants to do the right thing it can be kind of hard to see those failings in the care system. I've seen BS charting from nurses+cnas. I think a lot of people walk and talk like they know exactly what they're doing even if it could potentially hurt a patient. I eventually saught out counseling. Good luck to you! It gets better."
