The migravent has what your brain needs to calm down and get out of the hyperactive state, but thats only part of the solution.

I obsessed over books, research papers, studies, met with i believe 13 different people from neuros to energy healers...everything short of flying to a monastery and working with a monk. 80k roughly in billed health care costs this year covered by insurance but i finally figured it out.

The theory isnt really a theory, its just another way to describe what doctors call the 'multimodal approach' to fixing the problem. Taking a triptan, or taking supplements, diet, counseling,cefaly, gammacore, accupuncture, or exercise alone wont be the silver bullet to fix your migraine, but the combination of all of these things absolutely will assuming you have chronic migraine and its not caused by some other medical condition.

The books i read that had me chase this was 'migraine brain' and 'the body keeps score'.

Chronic migraine is a result of your brain running out of the chemicals it needs like serotonin and dopamine to keep your pain receptors in check. To put it another way, you are burnt out and will be burnt out until you fill those things back up which is extremely hard to do because they are rapidly depleted. It was stated to be by the headache clinic i worked with, and is 100% true based on my experience approximately 1 month of doing all of these things, for every year you have had chronic migraine for your brain to reset itself.
