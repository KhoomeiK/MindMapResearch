I think he has anxiety and ADHD, he's dyslexic too. He's so worried about his bills most of the time and get anxious if he cant pay on time. I'm doing my best now to understand him and be the kindest partner to him knowing he might be in spectrum, i have thought about that if he will remain the same for the next 25 years then i wouldn't be able to handle it but now i can see that he's improving, hes been more affectionate now and he's working hard and doing his best on his job, hes getting praised.
