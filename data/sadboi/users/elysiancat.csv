I don't think your feelings were wrong, it's terrible when you are vulnerable and you reach out and get hurt instead. It's difficult, but maybe you should put her at more of a distance.

What you should do is just try to keep the conversation moving so the other person doesn't feel helpless...I learnt this while trying to console my depressed friends. If someone asks how I am, I'll tell them I'm unhappy or stressed but then I'll also ask about them or their day etc. This way you don't feel boring and they don't feel frustration at being unable to help."
