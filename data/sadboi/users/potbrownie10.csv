Psychiatry,fr4sbtq,t1_fr4azzj,1589895891.0,"Thank you for being passionate about psychiatry and what you‚Äôre doing for Jordan! One other issue I know from personal inquiry is that it costs upwards of 50+ JOD  (70$+ USD) per private session which makes it way too expensive for the average Jordanian, (and doesn‚Äôt mean psychiatrists are paid fairly especially at the beginning of their career). I believe the availability of more psychiatrists will eventually bring this price down and thus increase the turnout of clinics. The biggest issue is stigma as you mentioned, which might hopefully die down with time as the newer generation consumes more mental healthcare without fear of judgment!"

BipolarReddit,f84owkv,t3_dyyqqm,1574256750.0,"I‚Äôm sorry for what you‚Äôre going through, that sounds like the last thing you needed. Surviving a suicide attempt has to be met with serious careful treatment afterwards or it might easily happen again. Since it seems like your girlfriend is going through stuff on her own, she might not have the energy to provide you the care you need, she will end up feeling guilty and you rejected. I‚Äôve had friends who realized that them and their partners needed therapy and that they were better off no matter how understanding and intimate the relationship had gotten. It would end on the terms of ‚Äúi cherish you, and you deserve wholesome help where you can entirely focus on you, and the same for me‚Äù type of thing. There‚Äôs just a certain limit to the energy you can give in a depressive state no matter how much you cherish your partner. 

I‚Äôm not saying you should break up with her, but you should analyze the overall usefulness of this relationship while putting your mental health first. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs going through a lot, but you need professional and unconditional care and attention to help you process such a traumatic experience. The fact that she didn‚Äôt know your whereabouts for some time while you were in a critical situation, is unfair to you, and might highlight her depression/isolation, but it also tells me you have a better chance at getting better without the stress of feeling rejection, focusing only on yourself and how to deal with what you just went through. Because that, is not an easy thing to experience. I hope this made sense and i hope you feel better soon!

bipolar,ewk4ay3,t3_cokm9r,1565476320.0,"Oh. Wow.... I‚Äôve had this for a very long time and didn‚Äôt know it had a name until i googled it just now. It started when I was around 15 when my life was beginning to derail and become stressful. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve gone one day without pulling my hair since then. In fact I was just doing it now because i tend to do it whenever i have a free hand reading or on my phone. 

I take Lamotrigine but I didn‚Äôt feel like it made it worse or had an effect on it. It could be you‚Äôre going through a stressful period in your life rn and having Lamotrigine in your system could make the pulling feeling addictive or calming (I found that lamictal made me hyper-fixate on anything/any new sensations that bring me relief or satisfaction, I‚Äôm not sure if this applies to everyone else).

Still, everyone is different, if it‚Äôs irritating you there‚Äôs CBT solutions you could ask your psychologist about. Best of luck to you."
