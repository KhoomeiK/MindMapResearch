Dr. Lee has many more videos about this exact issue if you look through her videos and are interested. There was one video where the scrotum was totally covered in calcium deposits but this was just the first one  I found when I googled it.   

I’m sending the link as I find her commentary about the condition useful. Apparently they are harmless and that certain individuals are just prone to develop these with no rhyme or reason (it doesn’t seem to be related to hygiene or anything of the sort).   She does mention that the best way to get rid of them is to have them removed in office rather than squeeze the contents out at home.  Having said this, because some people are just prone to them, removing them is likely not a permanent solution and that they can come back.  I hope this helps you!"
Infidelity,equ6wid,t3_bw2d31,1560325499.0,"To put it bluntly, there’s more biological undertone to the desire and need for sexual exclusivity than is given credit in the replies and discussions so far.  

For men, it is imperative that their woman counterpart is monogamous so that she is exclusively his to impregnate.  In modern times, this manifests as extreme rage in  that the female subject is making  herself available to the possibility that other men may inseminate and impregnate her.  Although this is not the outright, obvious  feeling that modern men face, this is the biological underpinning behind the rage that fuels men should their female significant other  stray.

For women, women desire a monogamous man so that she feels secure that all of his resources can go directly to their shared offspring.  In modern times, these resources can mean financially or just in the effort of raising a child that will turn into a healthy minded, self sufficient adult.  Doing so would ensure that her offspring will reach a productive and successful adult life in which they would have the means to further propagate your genetic line.

Any situation where the male strays is a threat to the resources that can be provided to the woman’s offspring - there is a higher likelihood that other offspring will be produced in the midst of male infidelity.

This is a washed down version of biological drives that subconsciously govern modern times sexual morality and the desire for exclusivity in humans.  The difference in humans vs other animals is that people are more sentient than the common animal world.  There’s a reason that, in some species, male animals  kill other males that pose a threat to their female “turf” and right for insemination.  Obviously, modern  men cannot just go out and kill any man that poses a threat because this is illegal.

Men tend to have a lower emotional tolerance for sexual infidelity because it threatens their ability to fertilize a woman. This makes sense if you consider the fact that most woman can only bare one child at a time for 9 months.  If you think about it, this means that if she is impregnated by another male, she is ‘out of business’ to carry your child for 9 months.  That’s a long time- especially if you consider the fact that women have a more narrow time frame in their reproductive years than men do.  Sperm on the other hand is less valuable because men have lots of it and can regenerate it quickly.  On the other hand, women tend to be more bothered by emotional infidelity because it centers the man’s inclination to expend his resources in the direction where he is most emotionally invested.  His sperm is not precious to her because it is abundant, but his resources are.

It seems that sentient individuals realized the practicality of monogamous relationships. It is true that people have sex without any intention to have children.  However, sex is pleasurable and sought after because it was evolved to be so, in order to give incentive for sexual beings to go out and have sex. 

Of course, social and cultural environments also play a role in people’s expectations for sexual exclusivity.  For example, I’ve read anecdotes of infidelity in France and how it is more easily accepted as a common ‘mistake’ (like you explained it should be in your post).  In these same anecdotes, French individuals claimed not to understand why Americans make ‘such a big deal’ about infidelity. My focus, though, was to provide another example (biological underpinning) that has yet to be discussed in this thread.

Again- this is a dumbed down, simplified, and washed down version.  Full disclaimer:  i have a biology background that does not focus on human sexuality.  I am fully anti-infidelity and do not condone it in my personal life."

The reason I don’t indulge sexting is because I find it incredibly cheesy and awkward.  It just doesn’t do it for me.

Some people just don’t get off on it.

Also, there were many occasions where I would get texts like that and my mind was no where near sex.  Like I would be in the middle of a paper and the guy would obviously act as if I’m a debbie downer or vanilla if I didn’t reciprocate interest at that moment.  So annoying."

You right about the stalking though.  It’s as if I want to make sure that he is not winning.  I feel kinda sick and demented in that I want him to suffer..."
