I usually try to distract myself by watching my favourite shows and ice cream, and if that doesn't help, I convince myself to keep going because of my younger sister and need to be there for her, so I stay strong for her and push through it. I would recommend to do that for someone in your life to, like your dog or mom or best friend or the beetle you saw flying past you today.

Jesus I sound so weird, like some white suburban mom who read one (1) post about mental health on FacebooküòÇ but seriously, hope you're doing well, and remember, even if you relapse, there's always a future where you can restart, and ey!
