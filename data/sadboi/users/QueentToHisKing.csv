death,fqah2zh,t3_ghnnxl,1589218958.0,"Here's the deal: It seems certain your grandfather is going to die sometime in the near future; however, you will still be alive and will have to deal with the good, and/or bad, consequences that will follow your decision. Some points to consider: ~ How close were you and your grandfather? ~ Was he aware of your home life? ~ If so, did he try to help or look the other way? ~ And by triggering, do you mean:
 A) makes it hard to breath triggering,  B) panic attack triggering, C) suicidal tendencies triggering, or D) something else? Only you can decide if going is physically, mentally, and emotionally good for you.  It might help for you to list the pros and cons on a sheet of paper. That way you can actually see the good and bad instead of just thinking it's all in your head. Take it step by step; moment by moment. I'll list some calming techniques below that may help if you start to feel panicked. 
~5-4-3-2-1 method. List aloud 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 good thing about yourself. The goal is that by the time you complete this mental list, your heart rate and breathing will have calmed.
~ Breathing by the rule of 3's. Breathe in through your nose for 3 seconds, hold for 3 seconds, breathe out through your mouth for 3 seconds, wait 3 seconds, and begin again. 
~ If you begin to feel panicked, interclasp your hands on the back of your head, elbows wide, shoulders back, and chest up. When scared, humans tend to draw into the fetal position, but doing this forces your body to stay in the moment. It helps to refocus your mind, breathe better,
- allowing more oxygen to reach your brain so it doesn't shut down. My prayers are going up for you because this isn't easy. You are not alone. Please reach out if you need help."

RBI,fggc8ls,t3_exzq4e,1580758809.0,"Here's my observances, (take them however you like):  
1:  As someone who has been falsely accused, I absolutley advocate for retaining an attorney. Even if you plan on talking to the police, a lawyer can read that type of situation much better than you or I can. Just like she said, they can help with interpretation and making sure your thoughts are related in context.  
2:  I felt her interview began in the right vein. Her responses to the questions seemed apprpriate; not like she was trying too hard to be perceived in a positive way.  
3:  My inner voice began whispering a little louder when she brought her daughter on screen to verify that Gannon was home after the hike. She told her word for word what to say. This could be interpreted a couple of different ways. A-she is telling the truth, and in her fervor to prove it she does this without thinking about how it would look or sound, or B-she's guilty but in her haste to prove her ""innocence"", she does what many criminals do...she deviates from the plan, and stupidly forgets that this is something that can be easier to prove or disprove. As she states, her daughter is only 17 and more likely than not, she will not be able to keep up with any falsehoods in a police interrogation. Or C- she's a narcissist who thinks she's the smartest person in the room and she knows/thinks she has complete control over her children and they will lie for her no matter what.  
3:  At one point she calls out a grieving mother for ""not wanting to take care of Gannon"", and then later on she calls out her own husband as someone she can't wait to apologize to her. This angered me because if Gannon is found, he will more than likely watch footage that covered his disappearance and will see this! If you truly believe he's coming home, then do your best to avoid traumatizing him even more at some point in the future! 
4:  In her conclusion, she states that she can't wait for Gannon to come home so all the people who think she may be culpable can apologize to her.  She doesn't say ""So we know you're safe"" or ""So we can hold you in our arms again"".  Her using his coming home as validation for her innocence is so wrong. If he comes home, he can say what happened, and that will be validation enough if she didn't have anything to do with it, but stating it the way she did, whether she's guilty or not, makes me feel like Gannon is only an object to her, and not a person at all."

HeidiBroussard,fdh2b9r,t1_fdgqswa,1578413851.0,"I do agree with this. I think you're correct in that she planned this for 9 months. She wanted a baby--but like any true narc, she didn't want one due to any maternal feelings to nurture and love someone outside of herself. She wanted a baby for what it would bring to her: attention, a hole she had that she could fill with an extension; a mini-me, for lack of a better term. If this was about keeping her place with her bf, then a miscarriage is easy to fake, and grief over a miscarriage would also be a way of tying bf to her side. One of those ""I lost our baby! I am now grieving, and you would be crap person if you left me now."" type of situations. Now, maybe she had already used, or over used, this ploy. Whatever the reason, she made the decision she was darn well going to have a baby, come hell or high water.  She probably had used selling a crib as a ruse for scouting potential victims. But here's the rub for me: she announced her pregnancy only after Heidi announced hers. At the moment Heidi made known she was pregnant, she was a marked woman. Sure, if Megyn found another victim, Heidi might have been left alone, but we'll never know. I truly believe that from the word go, Megyn's thought process was: ""I want a baby. I will have a baby. I will steal a baby. I will kill to steal a baby. If I can't find anyone else, Heidi will just have to go."" True narc's don't have true friends because they can't be true friends to others. The fact that Heidi and Megyn remained friends for so long is more than likely due to several reasons: 1) She validated Megyn's sense of self: made her appear a normal person who has friends just like anyone else. 2) Heidi probably never challenged Megyn. A narc wants to be seen as normal, saintly even, but is quick to cut any challenger off at the knees because they refuse to be bested. How can they, when they're supposed to be superior, in every way, to everyone around them? 3) The distance between the 2 probably helped perpetuate the friendship.  4) Heidi's own unstable relationship may have helped blind her who and what Megyn really was. Sure, they had been friends for 20+ years, but from all descriptions of Heidi, she had a savior mentality. She couldn't just abandon those she loved, no matter how much she questioned, or even hated, things that they did. She would just keep loving, and forgiving. Plus, pain is a lot like love in that it can blind you to the actions of those around you. You are so caught up in your experience that seeing others clearly is nearly impossible.
       I said all of that to say this: Heidi was always a means to an end for Megyn. What means and what end may have changed many times over the years. Caring, loving people, for the most part, do not kill their friends for any reason. When they do, a situational inventory and context must be taken in hopes of obtaining some semblance of understanding. When I look at this situation, all I see is a cold, calculating person using whatever is available to her to get what she wants. No thought for those left behind who love Heidi, no thought for those that love Megyn. She wanted what she wanted and everything else was secondary."

entitledparents,fbasr02,t3_ec7uby,1576685960.0,"This breaks my heart for you! Obviously you know your mom is using you, and now that you're tapped out financially, she's going to take you down with her. I know this is probably a pattern that was played out with her by every other person in her life, and you simply took up the slack by doing what you were taught. Now, you're drowning because you're trying to keep her afloat. Except this: she's not a victim here and you are not a trained lifeguard. You cannot care for someone else while neglecting yourself. Giving someone else a higher level of care than you give yourself will leave your emotional, mental, and physical ""bank account"" overdrawn and unable to help anyone. I was just like you so I'll tell you what I wish someone had told me long before I figured it out on my own: You need to emotionally divorce your mom. Change the way you think. In my mind I would tell myself ""I've told brother not to drink or he can't stay here, but he drank anyway. But if I kick him out, he'll have nowhere to go and I'll be a horrible sister."" I put the responsibility for him on my conscience and squarely on my shoulders. I had to change my thought process. Everytime I would find myself thinking these thoughts, I would correct myself out loud, putting the responsibility back on him. ""I gave brother a place to stay when he had nowhere else to go. I told him no alcohol in my house and no getting drunk then coming home or he would have to move out. Brother knew the consequences for getting drunk and did it anyway. Brother has to move out."" It's not easy, especially when it's a cycle that you've been taught all your life. You'll be looked at as if you're disgusting and possibly spoken to like a dog when you no longer fit your family's definition of normal. But in truth, you will be breaking a toxic cycle of abuse in a quest for healthy and loving relationships. You can do this, OP!"
HeidiBroussard,fb9pd4x,t3_eb5llq,1576645184.0,"Just caught this but wanted to address a few things I noticed.  Everyone is talking about how he didn't answer his phone in this interview, but it was his dad's phone that was ringing. Also, they may have specific ring tones for certain people. They stated they have received 100's of calls, so it would make sense to set seperate ringtones for family that way you know in an instant if it was family calling to check in or an unknown caller with a possible tip.  I also noticed that everyone is talking about her telling him to grill the lunch Silas didn't finish, but when I listened, it sounded like he said "" He told me to grill it."" as in Silas said it. That sounds reasonably like something a 6 year old would say; it's completely out of left field which is how I remember many of my convos with my kiddos. As for the randomness of some things he said, I think everything is running through his mind so fast that there's no way he can filter it all before it comes out. My gut says he didn't do it.

My ex waited until I had been remarried a grand total of 2 weeks before manipulating my 3 year old to accuse my now husband of molesting her. To this day, 11 years later, it is the most horrible thing I've ever endured. It touched off a custody battle that is still dragging on to this day. My husband has been subjected to 2 polygragh tests, which he passed. 1 at the request of the investigating agency, and the other as part of a forensic counseling plan to determine a finding. My daughter also endured sexual exams and forensic counseling, and no sexual assault was found to have taken place. Lost jobs, evictions, public and social humiliation, and CPS investigations have only been some of the results of this false accusation. There is also the mental and emotional trauma that this child has endured as a result of her manipulated accusation, and the guilt and accompanying feelings this has caused her. One of the worst things? Having to watch as my infant was subjected to a sexual assault examination. She will never remember it but I will never forget it! All of this resulted from an accusation that was proven false. My unemployed, shiftless, narcissistic ex still has primary custody all these years later. Why? Because once child molester or pedophile has ever been breathed in conjunction with your name, it can never be undone. People will see it or hear it, and without further checking, will close their ears and minds to anything you show or say that proves your innocence.  The stigma will always be there, waiting to attach itself when you least expect it. It will affect your loved ones, your friends, and anyone else associated with you. The good news? You can move forward, even move forward with this woman and her child should you want to. You will learn to value trust and have a deeper understanding of true friendship and loyalty. Don't be like so many others in your life right now. They've let this color you in their mind, despite what they already knew about you, despite any good they know you've done.  Don't live the rest of your life trying to prove how good you are. Live the rest of your life simply being the person you've always been."

We don't know why their parents hadn't told them about their choice, but it was their choice not to do so until OP went full on, no holds barred crusader on them.  Hopefully, healing and understanding for all will be found for this sad situation."

breakingmom,ew70raw,t3_cmwre3,1565184212.0,"Lol! I have a similar story about my husband I love tell. Our daughter was about 2 and had no concept of privacy. This was during that inbetween stage of her getting old enough to notice certain body parts, us needing to use the bathroom but not being able to lock the door because, ya know, toddler. I'm folding clothes in our bedroom with kiddo helping. Hubby walks into the bathroom and shuts the door. Kiddo decided she needed to talk f2f with daddy. She flings open the door, he screams like a girl. His scream scared kiddo who slammed the door shut, only to open it again to quickly say ""I like you tail, Daddy!"" Y'all, I died! To this day, hubby still looks traumatized every time I bring it up."

OP: I don't feel comfortable with that. I'll just stick to my regular duties.""
S: ""Here is a write up for insubordination. Please read it ,write down any comments, and then sign it.""
VS.
S: ""I'll be out of the office next week. Will you please take over the job of keeping everyone on task. I would appreciate it if you would also take notes until I get back.""
OP: ""I'd rather not because I don't feel comfortable in that position.""
S: ""Here is your write up...same as above...and sign it.""
OP: ""Only after I speak to HR.""
The difference is in the phrasing."

It will affect their lives, as well, and their families lives. Every decision has a consequence and every consequence has a trickle down effect. Her actions were going to affect a family, like it or not. But she would never bare the consequences, and hopefully learn from what she did, if nothing was said or done to her. Sad that her kids have to suffer, but you did the right thing, OP."

The families themselves would have been stigmatized for their child's behavior and for not being able to take care of them at home. Also, there is still the fact that he was an only child, and they were probably still reluctant, no matter how much they hated him, to give up that bond.

As for funeral and benefit information, most law enforcement or DA offices have a victim's rights advocate, and many of them can also help you navigate the uncertainties you are facing right now. You may also contact nursing homes, as they are probably more in tune than anyone when it comes to funeral homes in your area."

AmItheAsshole,es1c8is,t3_c5a4jh,1561493637.0,"I know that I will be in the minority here, so Oh, well.  You are NTA. Does said kid have any other rules she can just decide she doesn't like and will not follow anymore? Chores she can say she doesn't like and can pass off to others?  Probably not. Do you require her to visit grandparents and other various family members with you, or does she get to say ""No, thank you."" and stay home? You are perfectly within your rights as parent to require her presence at church with her family. She may decide later on that she really doesn't like going and never set foot through a church door again. Or she may decide that she's glad you made her stick it out because, at 13, she doesn't know much about any major life choices to decide if she likes it or not. You will definitely get crap. But here's the defining question: do you, as a parent, try to live up to the precepts your church teaches, or are you a once-a-week and done family? If you don't try to do what's spoke about in church, your daughter may look at you and wonder what's the point. Not saying this is the case, so please don't get offended. Also,if this is something very important to you, she should go out of respect for you. But hey, teens...."
