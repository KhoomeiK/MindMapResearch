I would agree that a lot of what people call structural racism exists and is both troubling and solvable. I also believe you can't ascribe racism in any form to cultural norms or even genetic diseases prevalent in certain populations that affect desired sociopolitical outcomes.

This doesn't always alter how you tackle the problems associated with these outcomes though. So, for example, black communities hit harder especially in terms of death rates by the Wuhan Coronavirus deserve any extra care that can improve those outcomes, but those outcomes aren't _necessarily_ the result of structural racism (but probably mostly are). And this doesn't also mean you don't spend your resources wisely, but there is a fairness in helping the most in need, even at the cost of more the more fortunate masses (without any irrational trade in life, of course--raw numbers there, if possible). No genetic diseases should be beyond study because the population is a small minority. No community should be this left out or would be okay this left out, doesn't matter who you are or how those problems arose.

Think Saving Private Ryan, maybe."

We project the need for flu vaccines. We identify the worst and most dangerous strains of the season before the season, and we vaccinate for those. They're not always the strains that make it here, and they're not always exactly the same, and they're not always as bad or as light as we expect. Additionally, you're really looking to reduce reproduction and improve herd immunity, so 25% isn't bad. If I get Wuhan Coronavirus and will likely transmit it to 3 people who will transmit it to 3 people . . . so now we have a factor of 3 per generation. In five generations of transmission, I could alone produce an additional ~250 cases. Now, if one in three people _can't_ get sick, meaning rate of transmission is closer to 2/3 per generation of what it was previously, or two. In five generations, that's ~30 people instead of ~250.

So you could say something like that a 33% effectiveness for a vaccine reduced the total case load by 80+% in five generations.

I know epidemiological modeling is _far, far, far_ more complex, but a bit of simple math should give you an idea of how slight changes in transmission rates alter infection numbers dramatically."

TrueOffMyChest,fhdnf9v,t3_f2dvxi,1581492646.0,"Um, your wife is a pedophile. You need to never have children with her at all, ever. Pedophiles have a terrifying recidivism rate, and your kids will never be safe.

See a therapist alone and see another therapist with your wife. You don't want the same therapist because they'll unavoidably become biased. I don't want to tell you to get divorced, and I'm one for forgiveness. I'm bipolar with BPD and general anxiety disorder. I have and will continue to put my loving, dedicated wife through the ringer. But my mental illness has never been the cause of physical or sexual abuse in our relationship. I'm not sure you can ever really work it out with her given the enormity of what has happened between you.

See a therapist. You would see a doctor for cancer. This is easily the mental health equivalent."

Bill Burr did a joke about this—it's couched in an argument with his wife, who is black—that points out how stupid it is to cling onto culture or knowledge as though they're owned by a race simply by originating in groups who are dominantly one race. Nobody owns the blues. Nobody owns apple pie. Nobody owns science. Nobody owns farming. Nobody owns information. Nobody owns culture. If you disagree, I think you need to as yourself if _you_ hate others strictly because of their race.

Damon Young is a bad person who is sewing racial hatred in order to get clicks. Please don't be like him or the conservative version of him: Donald Trump."

I have described these symptoms exactly for a dozen doctors give or take a couple, and not fucking one of them ever talked to me about a condition called akathisia. I guess even the fucking Russians have a better medical system than ours.

Jordan Peterson delivers even from a Russian hospital."
