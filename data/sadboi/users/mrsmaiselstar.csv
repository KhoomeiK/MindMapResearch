unpopularopinion,fpd5nao,t3_gci9e9,1588520343.0,"I think this depends on the scenario. If this is a one time mistake, I think I’d probably say even though you’re free to do anything you want, if you have the means to help your own child you should, especially if they are under 18. If your child is above 18, fine you have 0 responsibility, but also don’t be surprised if you’re called out for being a jerk and lose part of your relationship with your kid. I would probably in many (maybe most) cases assume you’re a dick. Many parents help with their grandchildren at least the first year, even for grown and stable parents. However, if this is a common mistake and maybe it’s their second or third unwanted child or maybe they’re trying to put all the responsibility on you, then yeah I think it’s fair and understandable if you wanna remove yourself from the situation."

TrueOffMyChest,fi6af4i,t1_fi61d2j,1582185354.0,"Well I’ve definitely seen it from both sides of course, very superficial men and very superficial women. At the end of the day I think that’s their own choice, maybe one day they’ll grow up or maybe they won’t. I just feel like if a woman wants a tall man, or a man wants a skinny woman then why’s it up to me to tell them otherwise? As long as they are respectful about it. Don’t like her? Ok move on to the next person. I’m not very superficial but I also understand how attraction works and we’re all conditioned with all these superficial expectations that we grew up with, and breaking the cycle is hard. I’d hope people can look past just looks, but also I don’t think there’s anything wrong with having preferences. They could be superficial and miss out on a wonderful person because of it, but also they could be superficial, find a very attractive person to them and be their soulmate.
I do not understand though, why people take this movement so personally, sure there might some bad apples but that doesn’t represent the whole movement. There’s an audience for everyone, and there are men out there that like fat women, I don’t understand why it’s wrong for them to like them, once again just a preference"
TrueOffMyChest,fi349on,t1_fi2odcp,1582100243.0,"You’re trying to find all these very rare and obscure cases, yet I’m very active in the body positivity community and this is not a common theme. The body positivity movement goal for a lot of people is stop bullying, practice more respect, and also still not hating yourself regardless of where you are on your journey. Ofc there is gonna be a group of people that don’t fully represent the movement but that’s for every type of moment, just how there’s terrible feminists but also amazing ones. Also you do see old short fat men with models (usually because of money sure) but also women are usually the least superficial gender. As a huge ally of the body positivity movement I strongly believe that if it’s in your ability to work out and eat healthy, you should of course because it’s healthier and will make you feel better. But I also think bigger women don’t have to hate themselves because of how they look or people should treat them as less. Even if they’re sick because of their weight or whatever else, it doesn’t justify being a dick to them. There is a balance to the body positive moment and sure not everyone does it “right” but it doesn’t represent the whole movement."

TrueOffMyChest,fhxykq6,t1_fhxfbkr,1581964965.0,"To clarify. Like I said, you were generalizing in the FIRST comment, and THEN you clarified. That’s what I said previously. Which if you talk about a group of people in a negative light, you’re only adding to a negative impression of them, so not very helpful. Also I mentioned I worked in retail TWICE lol “multiple times” okay, idc if you don’t care but that’s what I’m showing as my example. You’re the one that mentioned a customer facing job and so I used that too. You have a personal experience and I have mine, yours is not reflective of how it is everywhere but also mine isn’t, of course it depends on where you come from, but just because that’s YOUR experience doesn’t mean you’re gonna paint a negative light on a group of people because of YOUR experience. So that’s why I was letting you know my opinion by also giving you real like examples even if you “don’t care” which is not the point. Like I said previously, of course I agree you SHOULD probably learn the language of the country you’re moving to, but you don’t HAVE TO and no one is entitled to treat you a certain way or as less because of it. I’ve seen Americans move to a Spanish speaking country and people are so nice to them and have tons of patience, but I’ve seen brown people and asian people move to the US and not speak English or barely and be treated as less, and THAT’S my point (and yeah yeah that’s MY personal experience that I’ve seen MULTIPLE times and that is very commonly spoken about on the internet and even videos of it, the very common “go back to your country” narrative). Your comment is just not helping them AT ALL, but painting them a negative way. Comments like that feed the xenophobes and racists of the Internet, so you’re just adding to THAT. And I’m not saying that’s what YOU are, at all, but sometimes you have to be careful of what you say, specially when speaking about a group of people that already experience higher rates or marginalization. You’re clearly missing my point but that’s fine, like you said you have your opinion, I have mine."

Maybe they’re not the smartest, maybe they struggle, maybe they JUST moved or maybe what if they didn’t really try. So? It doesn’t justify being a dick about it. As long as they’re respectful why can’t you offer the same treatment? I can see how some people never learn English in places like Miami, they easily get away with it, even though the U.S is mainly English. And so what? They don’t HAVE to learn English."
TrueOffMyChest,fhwf3ry,t1_fhtz3j9,1581914032.0,"Ofc it’s not okay if they scream at you, but you’re generalizing and that’s the problem. And yes it would definitely be easier if they learned some of the language where they live, but even if they don’t it’s OK. You also don’t know their situation, they could’ve just moved here, they could be trying and struggling but that’s not coming through, or maybe like I said they can’t. Even if they can’t and don’t want to it’s okay, they don’t owe anyone an explanation. Yes it would be easier for them but there’s no need to bully them or talk to them as less. You’re talking about a specific situation that is NOT common, and generalizing it, which is harmful cause there’s always gonna be racists out there that will agree with you because of that one incident that doesn’t describe an entire group of people. I’ve way many more people that don’t speak English be very shy and insecure, and very sweet. I would never justify people screaming at a customer facing job, I work in retail so I know, but you’re just taking from a very rare occasion and generalizing it. I’m glad you’re clarifying now but your original comment was NOT that."
TrueOffMyChest,fhweb3n,t1_fhubvyq,1581913448.0,"Okay 50% is a HUGE number though? Even if 20% of the world’s population can’t learn a language it’s still a huge amount of people. I have an easy way with learning languages, but I’m also aware that some people DO not and I’ve met multiple people that struggle. Of course it would be everyone involved for them to learn the language but that’s not my point. My point is if they can’t or even don’t want to that there’s no reason to be rude to them or have expectations from them. You never know someone’s situation, they could be visiting for a short time, they could’ve just moved OR maybe they just can’t. Ofc it would be easier if they did, I don’t disagree there but not everyone does, and that is also OK"

If they get mad that’s their own problem, just let them be you don’t owe them anything either (which I worked in retail talked to hundreds of people and NEVER saw that, just people that get a little flustered or frustrated) but even if they were frustrated, learning a different language is hard. When you travel somewhere do you spend months learning a language for a vacation? No, most people don’t, yet would you be frustrated if people didn’t understand you, right? Yeah so what if they’re living here, they’re probably as frustrated as you are. Also there’s places here in the U.S where people can get away with speaking only a language, Miami for example.

Humans are complicated, and unfortunately what makes it more complicated is other humans. So yes it’s necessary sometimes to bring it up, for your own mental health. You don’t have to understand it, to know it’s real. Just cause YOU don’t experience it, doesn’t mean it doesn’t matter. I have an extremely good relationship with my parents and family, so for me as an adult matters that they know. Not putting my kids in a religious school? Yup, matters they know. Don’t want s religious wedding? Yup they need to know. Don’t want them enforcing their religion on my kids? It 100% matters.

I have friends that care about me, and actually telling them in many instances made the relationship better. Sure my family made me do all the catholic stuff, now that I’m an adult of course they can’t, they actually respect my opinion (they don’t like it but of course they respect it), I don’t have to go anything religious when I visit, and they never suggest it either, so yes Im very glad I told the and sometimes I even have just good conversations with them about it which I always enjoy. And not only that, my mom was a mormon and many years ago she asked why I was an atheist, I explained and she just listened. Years later she told me she was agnostic, and that talking to me was just another affirmation for me to stop being mormon. So yeah, I’m glad I told her even though “ I didn’t have to”. By telling friends I also found they were atheists too, but would probably have not known if it hadn’t been brought up, which when everyone is religious around you, then it matters a lot to know you have friends that actually agree with your opinion. Also when it comes to relationships, it’s important for me to me to know what my partner believes in, I can’t date someone that’s religious anymore, I just can’t, so yeah it matters bringing it up. I’ve dated religious man and that hasn’t really ended well, so yeah I bring it up. I don’t find myself bringing it up often at at, but has there been quite some times that I had to? Absolutely."

So yeah, I was done, and had to “ come out” so I could stop doing all this nonsense. They still made me do it, because they said it was just a “phase”. I never told my classmates cause who cares, but of course told my friends eventually (two of my classmates became nuns, so pretending to care was exhausting) so yeah, there’s some perspective for you. I don’t go around telling people, but the post is about “coming out” as atheist, and some of us actually had to do it.

And that’s okay, they’re still growing and they go at their own pace, and even if they weren’t cable to do it I would still love them because what matters is that they are good people. Idk I think there’s so many people that aren’t the smartest in power (I mean look at Trump) or that are very successful people. I think everyone has their own type of intelligence that others might not have."

TrueOffMyChest,ew3iwnl,t3_cmntbs,1565081198.0,"When I first moved to the US, it was really really tough. I was still getting used to the english, I was so lost, I had a hard time understanding people. And when I got to college I was not doing great,but I kept trying. I made new friends that supported me, I learned how to fence for myself and I slowly started to understand how things work. Eventually I got the hang of it. I am now so happy I decided to stay, it was better for my future and I met so many wonderful people. I wanted to give up so many times, and I ended up growing up and becoming stronger. At the end of the day it’s a personal choice, but just be sure you won’t regret it later. Give it your all, and if it’s not for you, move on to the next best thing."
TrueOffMyChest,ew3ik66,t3_cmlq0z,1565080696.0,"Well I met my boyfriend on Tinder, and he is such a wonderful guy, I’ve never been more in love. However 95% of the guys there just wanted sex. I spent so much time talking to guys thinking it was a normal conversation, when suddenly it would turn sexual very fast. I also like women, so I met women as well, and well all women just wanted to talk, hang out, grab coffee and not in it for the hookups. So many of my friends were on Tinder, and I know they wanted real relationships and are amazing people. So,I can say with certainty (and not just from my personal experience, but also because that’s just the way the world works) that you have way more chances of finding women interested in real relationships, than in hookups. Trust me, women have it harder, and yet even then I still got to find my boyfriend. So if I found him in a sea of fuckboys, you sure can too. So don’t loose hope cause 1 girl sucks"
awfuleverything,ew2xb88,t1_ew2utsp,1565058225.0,"You sound just like the Texas shooter and his manifesto, this isn’t only your country just fyi, as much you want to believe that. White men like you are becoming less and less relevant, I’m sure you see that on the news. Just cause it’s your environment doesn’t mean it’s the majority. You’re so blind to your own ignorance, just sad. I think you’re just scared because people like you are not being as accepted anymore, you’ll just hide behind a keyboard. Working is not a bad thing :) but not like you would understand, because you’re just entitled and have no real accomplishments. And then you call others lazy, ha! You don’t even work, you’re just a leech. Oh so proud you must be. My family might own several successful businesses, difference is I’m not a leech, and work towards my own accomplishments, not like you can relate obvi."
awfuleverything,ew2tht2,t1_ew2qguy,1565055464.0,"Mmm you actually said Make America White Again, idk if that’s you being a troll but yeah, as a brown person that’s pretty offensive, so of course I’ll get defensive, no doubt about that. Not like you would understand, because as a white person I’m sure you don’t have an idea on what poc experience. And sure, you are of course entitled to your opinion and how you feel about this woman, but I also am entitled to telling you how hateful this is, because it is, and I believe she doesn’t deserve that kind of hate, but hey that’s my opinion. And I genuinely believe you’re just insecure, as they say “The smallest dogs, bark the loudest”. No one cares or asked about your wealth, yet you still brought it up. Only people who have to overcompensate have the need to make sure people know about it, so people “know” they’re better than everyone else, you’re not, because you’re filled with so much hate. Also reminder that putting people down, doesn’t make you better either. And I hope one day you realize that you don’t need to be this hateful 🤷🏾‍♀️ also you keep editing your comments, idk what your goal is but maybe you do cause you realize how bad they are. Sure you call yourself a troll, but that doesn’t take away from how much hate you’re spreading. 👋🏾"
awfuleverything,ew2rhek,t1_ew2owdp,1565054019.0,"It’s not even his comment history, it was on this thread, he edited or deleted idk. It’s not an attempt, he literally said Make America White Again, and the KKK and all white supremacists have Trump as their hero? Not hard to connect them. I wonder why they love him so much.... oh well no connection whatsoever! It’s easy not to have “racial resentment” when you’re white and don’t share those experiences with poc, I assume. But sure go on defending your president that says he can grab women by the pussy, and calls Mexican people racists, murderers and invaders."

How sad boohoo, give me a break. Looking at your profile is enough to see how sad and lost you are. Being such a hateful human is the worst way to actually integrate to society, but hey good luck with that you seem to be doing great 👍🏾 you don’t know me but I do know you’re miserable that all has to show off is his skin color. Having a healthy lifestyle, exercising and eating right is key to a good life, can’t disagree! But being hateful like you are towards people you don’t even know and projecting your own insecurities to others, is not. Antisocial hair color? Masculine posture? How entitled of you to determine that, but sure go on thinking the world revolves about your own beliefs lmao."

As a woman of color I could easily complain about A LOT of stuff, but I also know just complaining and assuming the worst from people is not gonna be the way to get my point across. I would much rather have a conversation than just say stuff like “Oh Im invisible, you all just forget about us” I know it’s true with white feminism, but it’s a really bad way to actually make a point 🤷🏾‍♀️you’d be just complaining, not even explaining yourself.

However, I think your comment got so many downvotes because of the way you’re coming across, I don’t agree with this however I think you can still have your voice heard, but you’re not gonna get validation if you blame it on everyone else, and assume worst intention, people don’t react well to that. I think you have a good point and explained it well and I really appreciated you taking the time to explain it to me when I asked and you didn’t have to. I think that’s the way to do it.
