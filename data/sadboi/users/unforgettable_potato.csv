I used to defend him. I believed he changed. My idiot brain was like ""he apologized!"" but he still ran around being shitty. I had a weird emotional attachment to him because he gave him nostalgia for the early days of the net.

I really like his eyeshadow formula tho. I totally bought a mini jawbreaker off someone for half price. I s2g, if he did a mini version of this, I would proably do the same.

The names/themes are definitely in bad taste though. I don't know jack shit about makeup production but at risk of sounding like a Jonky apologist... Is it possible that the theme was conceptualized before the pandemic blew up? With interruptions in the supply chain and production line (in general) maybe it was possible that it's just not feasible that he could get it repackaged. I can kind of appericate that he wanted to get the make up out ""fresh"" so we don't have another JH level fiacsco. Maybe he should have ate a loss on this but I have a feeling the only ones who would have suffered would be the people further down the ladder.

Idk man. It's make up. You like what you like. I wish Jonky would at least at admit the timing of this release was bad instead of just saying ""my dad was cremated, my dogs were cremated"" because it sounds like someone dropping the n bomb but yelling that they have black friends."
