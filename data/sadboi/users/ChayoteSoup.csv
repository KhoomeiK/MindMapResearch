AskDocs,fo3bjqx,t1_fo35y5u,1587484066.0,"Ssc is very hard to diagnose because it overlaps with so many other connective tissue diseases. I don't have enough clinical symptoms (according to my rheumatologist) prior to my recent swallowing issues. (Due to COVID I'm waiting to be seen and have a barium swallow) for her to diagnose me and send me to a specialist. I've been having issues since 2012. Ssc affects everyone different; I dont have reynauds but the next person might. I tested for an extremely high titer of centromere antibodies, which is strongly indicative of CREST or Limited Ssc, and have been monitored and had symptoms treated as they pop up. My blood test alone isn't enough to diagnose me.

Diagnosis continues to be a long journey for me but for others it was quick; unfortunately because of severe life threatening symptoms. From my knowledge, with the exception of Sine Sclerodema, there is usually a degree of skin involvement which may not be noticeable right away. There's so much that I can share with you from experience and what other Ssc warriors have shared with me to help me on my journey. 

Diet is everything, be mindful and keep a food diary to see what triggers your body and what makes symptoms not as bad. I know you've probably heard this but stress is not good for you, try and decompress some how. I have anxiety and meditation helped me. You'd be surprised to see what destessing 5 minutes a day can do for you. Next is continue to be your own advocate. You know something is wrong, keep pushing. Ssc isn't a common disease, my rheumatologist told me that she has patients that have scleroderma but she feels more confident working with a specialist.

I hope I stayed on track with answering some of your questions. Take care of your hands and feet, especially if they're starting to crack. I'm having some issue with my skin between my nails drying up and splitting from the nail bed, really ouchies! Moisturize:)"
