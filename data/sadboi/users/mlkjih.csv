progresspics,f8lfwrj,t3_e0zd6f,1574621862.0,Yessss! I’m in the middle of recovery and you inspire me. 💕
AskReddit,f8dfov7,t3_e07nci,1574488884.0,"Had a best friend of 10 years, and was living with her and another roommate. I had surgery, and was prescribed painkillers. I few days after the surgery while I was still in bed recovering, I get a knock on my door. It was her and the roommate hand delivering me a literal *intervention note* about my “drug addiction”. They asked to have a “sit down talk” in the morning. They both went in on me about how “this is how opioid addiction *starts*” (they had just watched a Jon Oliver episode about it) and they were already seeing “changes in my behavior”, (you know, like how someone acts when recovering from surgery) I told her “you are being a fucking idiot” walked away, and got someone to help me move out the next day. I paid out the rest of my lease. I haven’t spoken to her since that day. Turns out she just wanted to live alone with the other roommate because they were fucking and wanted the house to themselves. 

(I moved back in with my parents, and because of that had the money to continue my education. I’m about to graduate next month, and will make at least double the money I was making back then. I will be living on my *own* when I move out soon. No more shitty roommates.) 

Karmic justice: The other roommate had to take so much time off work for mental health issues, they had to move from our very nice house to a tiny apartment in the worst part of town. Ex bff got a boyfriend and this sent the other roommate into a spiral. The other roommate wakes her up at all hours of the night to have her prevent him from self harming. I actually feel really bad for the other roommate and we are still friendly, because I genuinely believe he was manipulated by my ex best friend into helping stage that intervention on me. I feel terrible he’s having mental health issues and is about to lose his job, but think it’s pure karma that the sole burden of caring for him is now on my backstabbing ex bff.  

TLDR: Best friend/roommate staged a ridiculously unnecessary drug intervention for me to get me to move out, because she wanted to live alone with her fuck buddy."

That was hard to deal with mentally, but I just let my body have what it wanted. I train aerial circus consistently so I tried to keep up as much as I could. It was pretty rough for a while. I tried not to overdue it because my body is going through a big change. This past week I’m finally starting to feel strong again and starting to care less and less about what and when I’m eating. The crazy hunger is gone now. I feel like my body is starting to do what it was meant to do. I was so scared I was going to gain a million pounds the first few weeks, but that seemed to be an irrational fear. (I’d seen a few recovery posts that scared me to be completely honest) I’ve barely gained weight, but my body is so different now and I’m starting to actually and actively love with it for the first time."

Don’t bring up any concerns about her size, even if it looks scary  thin to you. I used to take “you look sick” as a huge compliment. Just be there to listen no matter what and don’t try to push onto the topic either. Let her vent if she needs to. I’m going through recovery on my own and wish I had a friend as caring as you 💕"
OCD,f6eifxo,t3_dqr3w9,1572804402.0,"Ugh. This is so true. I need to switch my psychiatrist and therapist (same office) because my psychiatrist pervs on me, and my therapist doesn’t read her notes or remember anything about me. She practically forced me to do an incredibly awkward TIR session where she just asked vague questions that I had no idea how to answer, and then stared me down for like 30 seconds every time I couldn’t give an answer. She never has anything helpful to say. Ever. The wait to switch is the reason I barely take my meds anymore because I cannot bare seeing either one of them again so I’m just trying to accumulate a 3 month supply of extra clonazapam while he’s still giving me scripts. (He overprescibes me and tries to make me take meds I’ve already had severe adverse reactions to) I’m not doing it anymore, it’s hundreds of dollars I don’t have."

I love to dance. I just did really well at a showcase last night and I feel like I’m getting better. It makes me happy because I never thought I would be good at it, and it’s an amazing way to express yourself. 

I just hung out with a dance friend for the first time last night and her friend group accepted me immediately and they are really nice people. I feel like I might have made a few friends after cutting out the toxic ones. I’m going to her birthday party this weekend. 

I’m starting to sing again after years of quitting  and my voice is getting better since I stopped smoking. I’m very proud that I quit. I’m thinking about doing an open mic soon. Grateful I’m finding my voice again.

I’m starting school again next week and I’m really excited to learn more medical shit. I love the field I’m going into. 

I’m going to take a belly dancing class tomorrow and I’m really excited. 

I’ve been recovering from an eating disorder, it’s been a month and I feel the best I ever have. 

My hair is growing out. 

I got a spray tan for my showcase and it doesn’t look bad. Grateful for that lol. 

My mom is extremely supportive and I’m so grateful to have her. I would be homeless if she didn’t take me back in. 

I just got an autographed copy of Steve - O’s book and he’s oddly inspirational to me. 

The owner of my dance studio took me aside and told me she was amazed by my performance last night and that I have amazing expression. She doesn’t know my past and told me I should branch out into acting as well. It meant a lot coming from someone who didn’t know I had already tried and failed.
It gave me hope. Grateful for her. 

I talked about my life story to a girl and she told me I should give a Ted Talk about what the entertainment industry actually does to people. She called me intelligent and told me she would be the first to read my book. Grateful to have met her.  

Coping: dance, aerial hoop, singing, writing, playing piano 

So right now I’m going to take a shower and not keep drinking. I had a drink before he messaged me and am a lightweight.
I’m going to stop drinking for a while. (I only drink once or twice a month but sometimes it makes things worse) I’m going to block him and move on. I’m going to watch YouTube videos that make me happy. I’m going to keep dancing and maybe try to pick out a few songs for open mic. I’m going to remember that I don’t need a man to validate me, and that it was never about him. He gave me validation and I don’t need that I just want it. 

I’m grateful for this sub and for you. Thank you so much. I already feel a lot better after typing out that random stuff. I hope I did it right. I know it was weird, and a lot. Thank you.

Edit: I’m going to start studying for my new coarse tomorrow and also go to the gym and practice aerial hoop in the morning."
