Unless you can create a sterile lab at home, there’s always the chance there will be some bacteria in the product. That’s why it’s super important to know how to set up a clean and sanitized work area at home, with sanitized tools and containers. And how to store and use ingredients in a sanitary manner. And of course: to use adequate preservatives in the product to quell bacterial/fungal growth. 

Will it be as successful as a professional cosmetic company? Highly unlikely. But you may become popular enough that you can make some kind of secondary income off of it. It would take a lot of work, though. And there is LOTS of items to buy in order to create the setup you need... 

If this is a path you’re thinking of going down, I would say- make sure you do *LOTS* of research before you start investing in ingredients and materials.

In a lab, the workspace, containers, and tools/utensils are sterile; the cosmetics are far less likely to be contaminated with bacteria and fungi in the manufacturing process. The people formulating the products in a lab are cosmetic chemists with a scientific background and years of knowledge and experience— using (typically) tested “recipes” that have some level of confirmed efficacy. And the advanced machinery in a lab can properly mix, combine, and/or emulsify all kinds of products with a very small ratio of error (whereas at home, with our limited consumer-market tools, there’s a chance we can mix things wrong any time)."

Since they don’t know who you are, they’re often not as invested in individual students’ success. You can scarcely get in to see a prof for an office hour or anything like that. Also, the quality of learning is not as high, from what I have heard. For example, a lot of my BIL’s assignments were not very comprehensive because the profs don’t even have enough time to read and grade assignments & papers for the volume of students they have.

The key is to NOT get angry or frustrated or to lament when these thoughts come by... to not fight them. 

But to acknowledge they are there, and then gently divert your attention to something else (with no judgment and no self-admonition). 

So you notice you’re fantasizing? So what! Now, don’t go along with the fantasy and indulge in it— but find something else to distract your mind— quickly! Something that takes your concentration! 

Now if you do that over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over... it does eventually stick! 

You may find yourself having to make these types of distractions hundreds or even thousands of times per day; this may frustrate you at first. But the key is to stick to it. 

Because eventually by gently distracting yourself from your fantasies and doing something else, you will be breaking that engrained habit in your brain, of your thought patterns leading to fantasies.

But I think the other person is right that you could try to start out with a lower strength kit to see how your teeth react in terms of sensitivity. 

Just remember that (unfortunately?) you will see more significant results with the higher % of bleach you use (which is going to be the more expensive-priced ones in the range, and the ones you wear longer, i.e. 1 Hr).

DIYBeauty,foywbkv,t1_foxmy22,1588180380.0,"If you’re really determined to use the charcoal, you could try it. Wouldn’t recommend it for long-term use. Usually for smoking stains, dentists recommend a good scaling and polishing. Scaling can sometimes be very good at removing particular types of surface stains, and the polish is abrasive but is only done once every 6-12 months at a dentist’s office. Of course, I understand that most people on Earth can’t go to the dentist right now because of the pandemic. But in the future, your dentist may be able to remove cigarette stains better with a scaling and polish. Something to consider, if you can afford to make it to the dentist even once per year. 

But remember that charcoal doesn’t replace a regular toothpaste in your daily oral hygiene routine. Regular toothpaste has fluoride in it, which is needed to protect teeth from decay, especially with modern diets that are higher in carbs and sugar which feed plaque bacteria and create an acidic environment in the mouth. 

Also remember that as long as you continue to smoke, or drink coffee or tea in significant quantities, staining will always return- and essentially negate the efforts of whitening remedies (including removal of surface stain). Truly maintaining whiter looking teeth takes a lifestyle change. That doesn’t mean giving up coffee or tea, but it may mean drinking less of it, or being sure to rinse with water after consuming such beverages- to reduce the amount of time these staining materials sit on the teeth. 

As to the Whitestrips... In my experience, the most effective Whitestrips are gonna be the top-of-the-line ones in the whole Crest range (“Professional Effects” or “Luxe Supreme Fit”), as they have the highest percentage of bleach in them, and the longest prescribed treatment time (1 hr every day for almost 1 month). Those are going to be the more expensive packets for like $60-$80 (unfortunately, for our wallets). So maybe if you didn’t see much results last time it was because of trying the lower strength strips which, imo, don’t always show results with significant staining. 

Anyway, sorry for the long comment, but those are my thoughts."
DIYBeauty,foxerfo,t3_ga1ssg,1588141776.0,"The idea that charcoal significantly whitens teeth is a myth at best. 

Charcoal may have some abrasive properties which could theoretically remove some surface stains. But truly yellowed teeth are not only stained on the surface, but below the enamel. The *only* thing that can whiten below the surface is a bleach treatment such as trays and gel from the dentist or a leave-on product like Crest Whitestrips.

Continually brushing with overly abrasive materials can actually make your teeth look *more* yellow, *quicker*! As you wear the pearly enamel down with these abrasives, more of the yellow dentin that makes up the core of teeth will show through. Once you reach that point, you can never go back.

In other words, teeth whitening with charcoal is a gimmick and more harmful than helpful for your teeth over time."

ETA: Another question: what type of brush bristle are you using (soft, medium, hard) and how hard are you pressing? Brushing too hard on the teeth and gums can cause inflammation. You should be sure that your toothbrush head is always labelled as “Soft” or “Extra Soft.”

It could really be at any stage in your life, the qualifier is just that somewhere deep inside, something is lacking— imo, that is. I *do* think that mental health conditions like trauma, depression, or OCD can definitely exacerbate an LE, too."
MRU,fo2ejn7,t3_g5as3s,1587459368.0,"Are checking in the registration notes if the classes are “(Program-name) students only”?

DIYBeauty,fo27h90,t1_fo2734p,1587452188.0,"No problem. I was once in the exact same place as you. Really wanted to make a light, gel-like “moisturizer” that wouldn’t clog my pores. Made a lot of different formulas with hyaluronic acid as the base; spent 2 years & hundreds of dollars finding out the hard way that it didn’t work on its own. 

So I am glad you’re finding this stuff out early! Wishing you all the best on your journey of learning and DIY!"
Calgary,fo23xf3,t1_fo1j1i4,1587448959.0,I was wondering if anyone else caught that clever word-play at the front end of the article! Made me chuckle slightly.
DIYBeauty,fo226v5,t3_g583me,1587447497.0,"As for the ingredients themselves, if you live in a dry environment, the aloe and HA won’t be enough on their own to moisturize your skin. 

These ingredients are called “humectants” which mean they attract water to them. 

That’s great if you live in a very humid environment (60% or greater on average), but if you live in a dry environment these humectants can actually make your skin *more dry* if there is no moisture to pull from the air.

I know it is hard when you have acne and you don’t want to put any oily substances on it, but it’s very rare that you can relieve dry skin with humectants alone, and you’d have to consider some conditioning ingredients.


Some other ingredients that you would want in a moisturizer if you want it to physically improve the appearance and feeling of your skin are **emollients** (fatty substances that condition) and **occlusives** (ingredients that hold moisture in the skin).

If you want to learn more about how to start formulating, check out this link- it has lots of helpful videos on how to get started: [Tara Lee- Formulating for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3bXzssoexWbJHk5fD_eRlCEnaJAOaIw1)"
DIYBeauty,fo2208x,t3_g583me,1587447343.0,"You will not be able to mix the Zinc Oxide nor the Vitamin E Oil with the Aloe Vera and Hyaluronic Acid- since Zinc and Vitamin E are not water soluble. The v.e.oil will repel the liquid nature of the aloe and HA; the zinc would simply rest in un-dispersed clumps throughout the mixture. It would not be safe to use as a SPF as there is no guarantee of even and reliable coverage. 

DIY sunscreen formulas are generally not advised, as sun protection is very serious and should not be undertaken by the novice. Even experienced DIY-ers may be hesitant to venture into this arena without serious research and education into proper formulation practices. 

And any DIY sunscreen that claims to have a certain SPF factor is literally breaking the law unless they have had it lab tested for proven efficacy."

These representatives can help to determine if she has a foundation to argue on (very likely), in which case they would probably assist your friend in escalating this to the appropriate Chair of the Department that this professor resides in.

My SO is a music instructor who was working full time and making a large enough salary that could afford us to move out.

Dentistry,fnxt2jg,t1_fnxslqd,1587345752.0,"My TMJ manifested from not being able to close my bite together. Therefore, I’d constantly be straining all of my face muscles holding my mouth in weird positions because I could not relax my jaws together. 

I don’t remember if I had trouble opening, but I had the soreness and the popping and cracking.

When my orthodontist fixed my bite so I could close it together, I now have a functional bite; most of the symptoms are gone. I still occasionally get the popping and cracking, and my orthodontist *did* tell me that I will always have mild TMJ for the rest of my life."

MRU,fnv7vod,t1_fnv3pq7,1587283298.0,"I’m not saying that I agree with the teacher, but I am wondering if the students copied the exact text or  information from the slides or book and forgot to cite it? The idea with open book exams is to try to paraphrase the information in your own words wherever possible (though I know it’s more difficult with terminology or definition type questions), and to always cite where you got the information from in parentheses- in order to avoid directly copying the work and presenting it as your own. 

I wonder if that’s where the mixup came from? Though the teacher is going about the issue in the wrong way, imo."

If you fail the course your only options are to pick Credit Fail, or to accept the Letter Grade- which will be recorded on your transcript. Benefit to choosing “Credit Fail” is that your GPA won’t be affected. 

You won’t be able to choose “Credit Pass” with a failing grade."
