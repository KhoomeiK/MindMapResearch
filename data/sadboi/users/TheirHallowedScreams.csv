I'm so aware that there is no noise occurring and I'm almost definitely about to have a panic attack. Strangely this is actually a good thing, I tend to feel really weird for a few minutes but will then start crying which means I'm back to reality."

AskReddit,fpcnxxf,t3_gcpdsh,1588507461.0,"If you went into the toilets and someone else was in there, it was an unwritten rule that you would turn all the taps on so that no one would hear each other. You would always hear people yelling ""taps on!"" from the cubicles. I told my flatmate this recently and he didn't believe me because he thought that people couldn't possibly be that worried about being heard peeing, just wanted to see if anyone else went to a really strange school."

Edinburgh,flu701b,t3_fr6du5,1585496591.0,I live in Edinburgh but have gone back to my home town Dunblane at the moment. Just went to their M&S and got really good deals for reduced fruit; £2.50 pack of plums for 65p and £2 raspberries for 39p so might be worth checking in case it's like that in other M&S's.
Edinburgh,fldnhbl,t3_fo1nep,1585068044.0,"I kicked up a fuss at work yesterday because my work had 2 people off who were showing symptoms of Corona virus and we were still coming in to work. I have asthma so am apparently vulnerable for catching it, we are now all working from home. I was so embarrassed as I probably came across as a bratty child, but I feel so much better now so speak up if you can."
