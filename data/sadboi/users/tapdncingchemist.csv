Then many people requested mail in ballots and the state was not prepared to deal with the surge in requests and therefore could not mail them out in time. They realized this a bit ago.  Up until that point, everything makes complete sense and is uncontroversial to both sides. 

The governor, realizing this was going to be a problem and prevent people from voting, sought to extend the election for precisely this reason.   This seems like a 100% reasonable solution to me, given the extenuating circumstances. I’d probably make it a lo get extension. 

The republican state legislature fought him on this, so he issued an executive order extending the mail in deadline by a week. The legislature decided this needed to be stopped within a matter of days and basically fought it all the way up to the Supreme Court, who voted a principle that indicates that election rules shouldn’t be changed so close to an election, which I understand the spirit of, but there’s a huge difference between shoehorning New restrictions at the last minute to disenfranchise voters so they won’t have time to react and responding to a logistical problem that arose from a global crisis so that people won’t lose their right to vote for trying to stay safe."

Part of their argument is that the evil beings cannot actually act against us without our consent, but rather convince us to allow ourselves to be controlled via ignorance.  This is why the deep state allowed Donald Trump to be elected even though they are all-powerful. The reason they cannot hurt us without our consent is because there will be karmic repercussions if they do so.  As a result, they can only control us via mechanisms that we choose (watching and believing the mainstream news, drinking water and taking medication that is poison, fixating on financial goals that perpetuate the current economic system for the benefit of our own egos, and now they are saying that the next form of control will come via the vaccine, which many people will voluntarily opt into.).

The above, while not something I believe in, does actually present an interesting rationale for how the deep state is both all powerful and also not able to squelch their movement.  They argue that we can be free from their control if we essentially “awaken ourselves” to what they believe to be the truth.
