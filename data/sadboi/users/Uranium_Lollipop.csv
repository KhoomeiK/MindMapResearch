Gonna answer a few of the questions people have been asking;

I'm 178cm tall. Starting weight was 150kg. I have another post you can check out.

I wasnt really a proper ""neckbread"" but I fit the bill pretty nicely and my mental health has imporved a lot since losing the weight.

And of course my teeth ,;( jk
I had a acid reflux problem as a kid so my teeth have always looked stained. Trust me my teeth are very healthy even thought they are a bit yellow.

Happy Holidays! 🤙🏻"

intermittentfasting,epqxd12,t3_bvla4w,1559414192.0,"Hey, I never really reached 400 pounds but my highest was 150kg/330lb. That was from mid January and my last weigh in last week I was 120/264.5lb. 

For the first few months I just tried to eat less, I didn't know what fasting was but I always had a hard time cutting out foods so instead I oppted to eating a lot less instead. From around March onward I properly started OMAD (One Meal A Day) and from late April I started doing some light cardio workouts at home a few times a week.

At this point my stomach has accepted that it's only getting one meal a day and I really don't get hungry, for me the first 3 weeks were hard because I was hungry in the mornings so when it came to my one meal I ate a ton (still, trying to not eat too many carbs just a lotta meat.) And after ""stabilizing"" myself started to slowly shrink the portions. I now feel disgustingly full from about 2/3 of the portions I used to eat.

I also am a big chocolate addict and being as lazy as I am the only was for me to avoid it was to just never have any at home. I couldn't be bothered to go to the store yo get some and eventually just kinda stopped having cravings for it. Though I do drink a lot of Coke Zero.

Anyways not sure how much I actually helped but that's my progress so far, best of luck!"
