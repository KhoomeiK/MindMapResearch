ostomy,fpkaj75,t3_gdxunu,1588691122.0,This is amazing what you are doing. I hope the people who need these materials find this post.
mentalillness,fpk8mbv,t1_fpk0xv2,1588690092.0,I can relate to what you are saying but please don‚Äôt end it. This world needs you even if you can‚Äôt see that right now.
mentalillness,fpizs9e,t3_gdpsn3,1588652732.0,"I understand what you are saying and I have felt similarly before. My advice would be to talk with Freud‚Äôs as much as possible. Have any human connection can have an enormous impact, even if it‚Äôs just texting a couple times a week. Also, I dint think it‚Äôs necessarily helpful for yourself if you just pretend to be happy when you are around people. If you are real with them, it might be beneficial for you."
Empaths,fpgtejp,t1_fpfr1m0,1588609176.0,"Not necessarily. Like it definitely depends on the situation but I think as empaths who are probably mostly introverts, we think people don‚Äôt like us when that is in fact just not true."
Empaths,fpgt7r2,t1_fpfpyhg,1588609078.0,Why do struggle to believe this? It‚Äôs true even if it‚Äôs hard to accept.
ostomy,fpgrg8a,t1_fpgaggh,1588608156.0,I love your positive perspective on this. I will utilize this information. Thank you!
ostomy,fpgrbcf,t1_fpft09m,1588608085.0,"Wow! Yeah, he definitely should‚Äôve been a lot more up front and honest with you. I‚Äôm sorry this happened."
ostomy,fpgr4n6,t1_fpfad3w,1588607990.0,I‚Äôm so sorry the doctors were so rude to you. I appreciate the advice on how to help the process go more smoothly for there patient.
ostomy,fpeci4m,t1_fpecboq,1588544792.0,Thank you! That‚Äôs very sweet. Also I love your username. New Girl is one of my favorite shows.
Empaths,fpec7fx,t1_fpdk3ou,1588544624.0,Thank you! I appreciate it!
ostomy,fpdh8hq,t1_fpddb34,1588526941.0,Thank you for providing that perspective to this difficult procedure and the transition that I‚Äôm sure is necessary afterwards. I will keep this in mind for when I care for patients with an ostomy.
Empaths,fpdh0z3,t1_fpd8i1p,1588526824.0,"As much as I would love to just read this and accept this compliment, I can‚Äôt do that. I must explain that this path to self care has been a very difficult one for me. I grew up in a household with a father who is a workaholic and in turn that is what I became. I learned from my family that it was more important to help other people (meaning helping my dad around the house to a point where I felt guilty if I didn‚Äôt help him because I had something else I needed to to)than to take care of myself. So as soon as I graduated high school, I moved away to college far enough that my parents wouldn‚Äôt make me live at home. By getting out of my family atmosphere, I was able to start the discovery on what it is like to be my own person and not feel that immense guilt everyday. It was a slow and hard process, but it was very worth it. In away, I ran away from my problems, which I do not recommend, but by doing this it gave me enough time to figure my own self out enough that I would be able to conquer the feeling and conversations that would need to be had once I realized that running away from your problems doesn‚Äôt work. The growth and process that I have been able to make it due to a few different things. Firstly, my relationship with God. This relationship has saved me from myself sooo many times. I was close to taking my life about 2 years ago and he intervened then and has continued to intervene since then in other situations when I needed Him. He is a loving Father to his children. Secondly, the relationship with one of my best friends because she was able to help me with the struggles I was experiencing from what I have explained here and much more until I was willing to go see a therapist to help me.  But back to my oath to self care, during the first couple years of college I struggled with realizing that self care was not a selfish act. Anyway, thank you for reading this far. I appreciate it. If anyone would like to know more about anything I have mentioned here, you can PM me."
ostomy,fpd43jw,t1_fpd16sq,1588519416.0,Thank you for the advice! I appreciate it!
Empaths,fpd3x0y,t1_fpd3h8d,1588519307.0,"Yeah, it sucked quite a bit, but I learned to not overwork myself so much.  By experiencing this I found out that they don‚Äôt care about me as an individual person. They only care about me as an additional employee at my workplace. I was crying because I was burnt out and overwhelmed from my job. So this gave me the motivation to start working in myself and finding satisfaction in other places."
ostomy,fpd3mdz,t1_fpd1853,1588519133.0,"I agree. And granted I don‚Äôt have personal experience, but I have observed this army job as a CNA. I think that no matter what the condition is  the nurse should tell the patient what she is about to do and be as gentle as possible."
ostomy,fpd3fhi,t1_fpd1w5g,1588519018.0,I strive to be a nurse like this one day.
Empaths,fpd3c2x,t1_fpd2j51,1588518961.0,I experience this at my job a lot. Just because I am a good worker and willing to work extra hours. But after a very difficult summer I learned that they don‚Äôt really care about me. Like I was literally crying my eyes out in the hallway and my boss just looked the other way.
Empaths,fpd0h1j,t3_gcni1y,1588517161.0,People take advantage of our loyalty to people as well.
