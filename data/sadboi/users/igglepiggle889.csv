Anxiety,fp9tsgn,t3_gbnjuv,1588434399.0,"I spoke to my therapist about this the other week as I'm terrified. I got triggered into a panic when I saw a busy bridge in somewhere in New York.  She assured me we will not be shocked back into the normal way of life. She works at the local hospital as well as private therapy. She said it will be gradual and slow.

 She also said to think about what it was I would want my life to look like once lockdown was lifted and start small goals towards accomplishing how I will live once the world is back to 'normal'.

 She also reminded me that I do not live on or near said bridge, In fact quite the opposite, in a small rural country island off of mainland UK. Nowhere like a New York bridge 🤷‍♀️😂🤦‍♀️Just my catastrophising brain. I'm still anxious about it but not as much as I was after thinking about what she said. I hope it helps someone else too xx"
