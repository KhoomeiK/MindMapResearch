But if it had been your dog for six years, you would want him back as well and you know it. It was not her fault the parents gave the dog away and she was probably really sad about it, maybe didn't even know about it for a time. The dog also has a bond to her that is probably stronger than the bond with you, and he misses her as well.

Kurz: Der Schutz von ""homemade"" Masken ist niedrig und abhängig vom Benutzer, aber besser als nichts und kann bei breitem Einsatz im Verbund mit anderen Maßnahmen (!) zu einer niedrigeren Infektionsrate beitragen. Wer nicht sucht, der findet auch nicht.

Es zwingt dich halt auch niemand, Maske zu tragen. Finds aber schon ein bisschen frech, die Bemühungen anderer dann gleich als Geschwätz abzutun. Leg doch bitte mal eine Studie vor, die das von dir zitierte falsche Sicherheitsgefühl belegt. Umgekehrt könnte man das Maskentragen auch als bewussten Akt und damit als Unterstützung für ein bewusstes Verhalten betrachten.

Insgesamt ist das alles ja auch von der Strategie abhängig, die man sich vorstellt. Masken für alle sind eigentlich nur eine vorübergehende Strategie, weil der Grundgedanke ist, dass man eben nicht weiß, wer infiziert ist - soll heißen, du als  Einzelner trägst die Maske für den Fall, dass du infiziert bist und es nicht weißt. Neuinfektionen sollen durch *Anwendung aller möglichen Maßnahmen gleichzeitig* so stark gesenkt werden, wie es geht. Wenn es wenig genug Neuinfektionen gibt, ist es wieder möglich, sie nachzuverfolgen und gezielt zu isolieren (--> Masken und Quarantäne für Infizierte, Maskenpflicht unnötig).

Der grundeinfache Gedanke ist, dass Tröpfchen aus unserem Atem, die üblicherweise die Krankheitserreger übertragen, reduziert werden. Dass dabei nicht alles abgefangen wird: klar. Aber wenn jeder eine Maske trägt, und jede Maske die Tröpfchenverteilung um den Träger herum auch nur auf die Hälfte reduziert, ergibt das insgesamt eine Menge.

Just saying it once then leaving it at that would have sufficed, as would have a simple ""that's sweet you wanna learn about my work, but right now I'd rather watch something that has nothing to do with my work""."

Your place sounds great! Just watch out, I heard they don’t like full sun and prefer indirect light so you might need a thin curtain or something - haven’t had much sun on them to test it out yet though."

houseplants,fo00v6a,t1_fnzjrmq,1587404117.0,"Not really so far! I haven't had the tetrasperma for that long. I think they aren't closely related, but they come from a very similar climate, so they like similar things - good humidity and being misted, bright light, and they both drink a lot.

The obvious difference is the size, the monstera is super big with long leaf stems that you need to bind up if you don't want them all over the place. The tetrasperma is way smaller with smaller leaves and even more of a climber than the monstera is, so if you don't have a lot of space I'd definitely get the tetrasperma - you can stake and bind it or let it climb on a trellis. They are so pretty, too, love how the leaves are always asymmetrical."

relationship_advice,fno3dnt,t1_fnnk51r,1587110578.0,"You could also do this more figuratively. Get to know more female characters or thoughts so you acquire more reference points of women being just human (meaning there are some you will like and some you don’t like). It’s not that there aren’t shitty women, you are just too deep in a generalized personal prejudice. 

So maybe if you don’t wanna befriend women in real life, get reading and watching. Watch Studio Ghibli movies, most of them have female protagonists and have a focus on kindness and dealing with the people around you. Read books by women and about women. By all means, if you want to, read teenage media meant for girls.

But don’t be afraid to befriend girls or women. If you are worried about being weird, you are on the right track. Use your words, ask them when you feel something specific you do is weird. If you feel you need to, say sorry. Don’t treat real girls as study objects though. Go for similar interests, tastes, hobbies, and build a friendship on that. 

It’s lovely that you’re trying. Honestly. You’ll be fine. It’s not your fault. Your family is punishing you for something someone else did. You are so young, you have so much time to be out there and build your own worldview - meet many different people - women. And you won’t be stuck. Even if you change slower than you like, you can always change, and you can always continue the process. I wish you the best luck! :)"
