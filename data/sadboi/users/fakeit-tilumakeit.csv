It‚Äôs relationship advice. Communication is good advice! Some people just need to find a reason to bitch about something. 

Everyone has different ways of handling all emotions. No one is the same. All I‚Äôm trying to point out is that if your the type of person that needs time to process your thoughts and feelings before you talk, then say that rather than just walking away so you don‚Äôt blow up. You would be surprised how much it helps to just tell a person you just can not talk about it right now but that when you are ready you will. 

Case in point tonight my SO and I just got into a fight because he‚Äôs not feeling right about his thoughts and emotions. I had asked via text if he needed to be alone he said yeah that he couldn‚Äôt be around people right now. Later I said you need to go somewhere for awhile. Neither of used the words we wanted to. Just wanted to get a basic point across. HUGE MISTAKE!

Clear communication went right out the window and turned into a big fight that lead me to the assumption I had done something wrong to piss him off, to make him not want to be around ME. and he got lead to the assumption I was kicking him out. FML"

Ok you got upset when he brought this up because you still have school expenses, but you also want to spend $100 on him instead of the school. 

If what you have for bills is a priority and you can‚Äôt spare the extra cash to treat him or help, them don‚Äôt waste it on a present. Seems counterproductive. 

Now on a less bitchy side of this. Maybe he does see a future with you and just wants to know you are in it for him and not for his wallet. Maybe he said something because he wants to know that he matters to you as well. If you only see each other 2 nights. Pay for the groceries to cook him a nice meal. Treat him to a night out. It doesn‚Äôt have to be some grand amazing restaurant. Just put in the effort to show him you care about more than being paid for. 

Offensively right now, to me at least, it just sounds like a boo hoo. Like you cleaning dishes should be enough. You have no job and basically everyone around you financially supports you. I think it‚Äôs kind of crazy that you don‚Äôt see that"

Even if nothing has ever happened and she didn‚Äôt see anything and he‚Äôs never done it before. It was completely unacceptable behavior. Who can even get in the mind set to be watching porn let alone anything else when there is a child x amount of feet away!

You need to have a talk with your daughter. You don‚Äôt have to go into specifics BUT you do need to address it because I promise you if anything has happened it WILL have effects to her in the future. 

Simply tell her that it‚Äôs not ok to keep secrets and ask her if anyone has ever told her secrets or if they‚Äôve showed her something or had her do something and said not to tell mommy etc. there are tactful ways to do it. 

I have a 5 year old little girl myself and my deepest fear is that my traumas will become hers.

HOWEVER she should have never said it was because you cheated. She‚Äôs not ready to be real with the world that‚Äôs her prerogative, but don‚Äôt try to take the light away but making up lies about the other person. That is extra shitty.
