ToolBand,f5553s8,t3_dmm495,1572000005.0,Would love to hear Descending on this stop!
ToolTickets,f554tvf,t3_dmso31,1571999736.0,Yes please.
TooAfraidToAsk,f3ra7u3,t3_dhooik,1571085966.0,"A couple years ago, every time I tried to refer to something that was the color blue I would instinctually say “yellow”. Then last summer, every time I wanted to refer to a hotel, I used the word “elevator”. So freaking weird."
ToolBand,f2picnf,t1_f24snmz,1570343879.0,Descending has remained my #1. It’s going to be a tough track to dethrone.
ToolBand,ezgrwpc,t1_ezg3mgv,1567900686.0,That shits sexy as hell.  DM me if you need someone else in your will.
ToolBand,ezfqsch,t1_ezfq887,1567881927.0,I mean... I have a bootleg from years ago before I new that’s what I was buying. This was $34 at a Movie Trading Company and shrink wrapped.
ToolBand,ezbomb0,t1_ezbj9lc,1567823286.0,Hey your still out there!! Can we get an “anonymous” ama or something?

ToolBand,eywungr,t1_eyw4tm9,1567538297.0,I’m so glad to hear more people say it. I feel like I’m taking crazy pills here.
ToolBand,eywukfz,t1_eyw51l1,1567538244.0,I need to go back and focus on that section.
ToolBand,eywufwb,t1_eyw6re2,1567538163.0,Right?!? It’s like picking the best track on an album comprised of tracks that shatter most other sonic endeavors created in the last decade.
ToolBand,eywu4vf,t1_eywh4wh,1567537964.0,"Yeah, depending on the hour of the day, that is a tough choice. Invincible is incredible, but Descending continues to win me over."
ToolBand,eywtuls,t1_eywsjr7,1567537775.0,I so agree!!! There’s also a lot of talk about how Maynard isn’t in the 2nd half of the song. I had to go back and listen because I actually hadn’t noticed his absence (please don’t crucify me). The instrumentation on the back half of that track carries it wonderfully to the conclusion.
ToolBand,eyv6tnf,t1_eyv5bwd,1567482480.0,"Agreed. It’s a solid follow-up to “So long and thanks for all the fish” which yeah, may not belong on this subreddit, but at what point does it become impossible to ignore. I also like that it, even if unintentionally, nods to all the fans who kept saying, “don’t die this week.”"
ToolBand,eyv6l3i,t1_eyv635a,1567482259.0,"I’ve only had the pleasure to see them once so I didn’t know it had been telegraphed for so long. As an individual whole unto itself, it hits me right where I live."
ToolBand,eyv6frm,t1_eyv5vqc,1567482123.0,Since FI was the single I’ve listened to it way more than the rest. I was surprised that the single also ended up being the first track. It’s a great prelude for what’s to come.
ToolBand,ey3aqik,t3_cv47q8,1566759675.0,We are the chosen ones.
