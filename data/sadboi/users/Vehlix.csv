getdisciplined,fnjbp4k,t1_fnhjjy3,1586995757.0,"The smaller chunks you're able to make, the easier it will be to gain momentum and begin taking on bigger chunks over time.

Things take time and that's okay. Learning to be patient with yourself and stop judging yourself is the key to progressing.

Take getting up in the morning for example. Many people have trouble getting up right away and starting their morning routine. Over time just take it one tiny bit at a time. When your alarm goes of, instead of jumping up and just going, just focus on sitting up. Do that for a couple day. Get into the habit of just sitting up. Once you're used to doing that, sit up and place your feet on the ground. Then do that for a couple days. Keep adding little bits at a time until you're able to get up and begin your routine with very little effort. Add things like drinking a glass of water immediately after waking, try doing some breathing exercises or meditate. Whatever you need to do to make your morning routine something to look forward to instead of dreading. It sets you up for the rest of the day being positive and productive.

Most importantly, believe in yourself!"

Stoicism,fmtzy2u,t1_fmsm66v,1586382023.0,"Look into Dialectical Behaviour Therapy. I went through the exact same thing. Being aware of your emotions, identifying them, and then identifying the facts of the situation are key. Do my emotions and their intensity fit this situation? Are they appropriate based on my beliefs? Why does this external source evoke these emotions? Mindfulness is key. Evaluate the situation, and react accordingly based on the facts. Connectedness between your emotions and what is logical and rational will lead you to a wise mind. It will help you take a negative situation and the emotions that come with it and turn it into something positive and something you can grow from. The emotions can still remain, they're natural, but you're ability to utilize them for progress is up to you."

However, BPD isn't all that simple. If you're here because you have it, you understand that. BPD can explain my actions though. I was in a high emotional state and I did what I did in an attempt to make myself feel better the only way I could think of at the time. It was impulsive and unproductive not unlike spending money recklessly or doing drugs or even self harming to make the bad feelings go away. Of course that was dumb but at the time I wasn't thinking clearly and lacked the skills to be able to talk my self out of it.

If sitting there and being rude to people online is the way you process things, than all the power to you. You weren't present in these situations so you couldn't possibly know all the details. She did some things that really hurt me too. 

Don't forget where you are we're all just doing our best."
BPD,fmcyw9v,t1_fmcxywp,1585955676.0,"My ex also just did this to me. We broke up so I could focus on myself and try to get better at handling my BPD without feeling the pressure and obligation of a relationship. While separated I did something I now recognize as stupid as fuck, but in the moment was too emotional and distressed to really think about the consequences ( I didn't sleep with anyone or anything, I just downloaded Tinder to receive validation when I was not feeling so great about myself) I told her I had done this but when her friend showed her my profile, it made her really upset and she just completely dropped me from her life. 

Cue the most painful and excruciating week of my life full of crippling panic attacks and suicidal ideation. It did not feel nice. Now I just feel sick to my stomach every single day for how I hurt her and how stupid my actions were. 

You're not alone. Someone will come into your life and won't be overwhelmed by your illness. Everything is going to be okay!"

BPD,fmccqoe,t1_fmbya02,1585943177.0,"Yeah if you're in Canada, keep trying. My personal doctor is so cool and chill and takes me very seriously, I genuinely feel like he gives a shit about me as a person, not just a patient. However it took me a few years and a couple different dick head doctors to find him and he really helps me. He's sent me to a few different psychiatrists too, one was helpful but couldn't keep me long term and the one after that was a complete idiot and didn't help me at all. I'm going to see a new one at the end of the month and very much looking forward to it. Hopefully they can help me find some better meds. 

&#x200B;

The counselor I'm seeing specializes in DBT and has helped IMMENSELY. I've been seeing her for 10 years and she's one of my best friends lol. However I still feel like I would benefit from trauma therapy and psychoanalysis type stuff to help me get to the bottom of my problems. DBT is helpful, but is only a means to teach you skills to manage your emotions, where as I would really like to understand them as well.

BingeEatingDisorder,fm550p4,t1_fm4z77t,1585766452.0,"Maybe just absent mindedness? Eating just cuz ya can? I still think occupying your hands in a different way may still help. Worth a shot at least? Chew gum at the same time so both your hands and mouth are actively engaged. Maybe just snacking on something healthier like low/no butter popcorn, peas or baby carrots, stuff like that, y'know? 

However, think about what you usually binge in those moments. Is it salty or sweet? I dont snack on chips or anything like that, but I know I have a serious addiction to sugar and use it to flood my brain with dopamine by way of cookie overdose. So now instead of cutting back because I know I'm am emotional eater, I cut back because I know I'm just superficially hitting the dopamine button and that's not really accomplishing anything. Maybe by trying to look at the problem more specifically, you can change your perspective and thus changing the way you're able to deal with the problem. 

Just my two cents. Might not work for you. But I wish you the best!"
