Kombucha,eu583ex,t1_eu4kjb7,1563471892.0,"Well, it's heavy on the wing-it side😁. I'd say generally about 2 strawberries cut up small(my fam likes chunks,) and 2 small pieces lemon, a rounded 1/4 tsp sugar in the raw. Been using fresh picked strawberries. This is about my family's fav flavor! I don't get a bitter rind flavor from whole lemon, as we drink them so fast."
Kombucha,eu57olc,t1_eu37opb,1563471646.0,"It is a 2.5 gallon from Walmart. It's nice, because it pours nice! I use it to brew 2 gallons at a time, then there is plenty room for a big SCOBY and air. I brew 2 gallons of tea;14+14 cups water, 2 cups sugar, 16 bags black tea, 2 bags green, 4 cups started culture from previous batch. My batch is done in 7  days due to my kitchen temp. 8 is also fine if I'm busy on day 7. Better luck!"
