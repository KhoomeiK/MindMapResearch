BPD,exr3ui2,t3_cu077z,1566510737.0,"I didn't want to break up with my SO.  I didn't know ""I'm tired"" is code for breaking up.  It's a euphemism for depression too.  ADHD made me lonely and him forget too much.  I read into his silence too many times.  He replaced me and l was the last to know.   I didn't get it until a week after too late.  He can't stand the sight of me now.  Both our hearts are broken and I'm responsible.  Never share these thoughts  with an SO.  Undermines the entire relationship and creates trust issues."

BPD,eu06gzg,t1_etz0co6,1563342606.0,You need to prioritize your own mental health.  One person can't be the support system for two people indefinitely.  You end up exhausted and burnt out.  It's hard to help yourself when you are needed by your partner.  But you are in need of support for yourself too.  I also spent time as a support system for two.  It's not a sustainable state of being.  Not taking care of your mental health to take care of your partners needs will lead to your own mental health crisis.  I've been with people incapable of supporting anyone but themselves.  I've been with someone who has been more supportive than I knew I needed.  You need to take care of yourself if you are going to continue to take care of both of you.  The lack of empathy and harsh words from your partner and the disinterest in learning how to help you is rather selfish behavior.  Reacting to your need for help with cruelty and  personal attacks  to shame you for your issues.  If he's your choice of partner and you accept him for who he is right now knowing he won't change.  it's  now on you to get the help you are in need of.  Don't wait until you are in real crisis to do something.

It started in prison,  It was about the character's children, was set in the future,  with the secondary characters in aging make up, new jobs that didn't make a lot of sense,  then a good character became a villain.   I had to stop when I couldn't remember enough to  watch it intermittently.  The Flash became convulted with so many different one off characters that  were introduced and killed the same episode. I didn't make it to the end of the last season.  They are now only watched when there are  crossovers.  They became unwatchable when the main characters of both were sent to prison.  They are just a mess of confusion and strange choices by  writers"

I figured out being left handed is why I'd been having problems with almost anything I do by hand.  I figured out why I kept falling down my apartment stairs. Why I had broken my closet doors.  I did everything I could do by myself.  By the time I felt done I knew where and what every item was. I was so happy there. I was so sad when the roof started to leak then pour water into my place, then my downstairs   neighbors.   I had to move out.  They needed to replace the entire roof. Sorry  I'm rambling but I was so happy living there and making the place my own.  Therapeutic AF to accomplish the project to a enjoyable result of the perfect place to be me."

If my texts aren't acknowledged at crucial times of vulnerability and I'm worried about explain myself well I send paragraphs of feelings and insecurities because I think I'm driving him even further away.  I did this for 5 days certain I was being ignored and given the silent treatment. The 5th morning I received my reply.  He told me where he'd left his phone,  apologized for making me worry,  told me he loved and missed me.  A secure and emotionally stable man who loves me is such a surprise I don't know what to do or how to keep it together when I'm out of touch with him. It's his life that is unstable.  I've been sure it's over too often and can't expect anything to change.    We're both quiet people who don't like to text or talk on the phone.  Our time together is  peaceful and content.  I believe we'll live together in the future.  I just have to remaim calm and stop the texts full  of worry and fear.  I don't see that happening.  He accepts me and my crazy.  I accept him and don't get upset with him when I know he won't call me, after he says he will."
bigdickproblems,etkm8eo,t3_cbxt6e,1562901758.0,Personal attacks and insulting comments meant to invalidate the relationship and your self esteem are designed to be as damaging as possible.  Whether they are lying  then or were in the past doesn't matter.  They're liars either way. Having you questioning and second guessing everything to make you doubt yourself is winning by their standards.   Can't believe anything they've ever told you after that.  Being able to trust someone to continue being good to you after bad past experiences is a great feeling when it happens.  I've learned how big the difference really is and I enjoy it.  Changed my life a lot.

He'd be a good dad and I'd be a shit mom. A baby would ruin us I'm sure of it.  I'm not sure what motivates people to stay where they are unhappy with people they don't like or want to be around.  Sounds like a miserable and depressing way to live  a life.  I'd rather be alone and single till I die  than stay with someone I'm not happy being with.  I'm not more interested in being in a relationship than being with the right person for me.
entitledparents,etdpqmz,t3_cb2so2,1562712202.0,I've got a friend with heterochromia. One green eye and one blue.   I don't know if I  asked about it.  We were teenagers when I would have. I don't have any unique physical traits but my full  name is unusual enough to be a topic of discussion.  Really messes with my ability to remember names when introduced to new people when I have  the same conversation over and over.  I don't even try to remember unless I know I'm definitely going to be spending time with them in the future.   My mom had to tell me my SO's parents names.  Otherwise I'm waiting for people to be addressed by  name during conversations I'm not a part of.   Stating the obvious is a great way to prove you  are both  rude and stupid in one sentence.  Not being taken seriously when you are expressing  feelings or thoughts is such a disrespectful and infuriating thing.  Rude and stupid too.    Stupidity is more of a choice than ever.  Too many make it every day.
AskReddit,etdg1x4,t1_etb0ihl,1562705852.0,Depends on the person having the conversation with you.  I knew a guy who would be  in the bedroom with his girl until she passed out then he'd come into the living room to talk to me. Happened every weekend for a while.   It was about good conversation and no more.  Being able to have deep conversations is a life skill.  Means you are really listening to people.  Accept it as an awesome experience with a new  friend and that's as far as you go.  Hoping it happens again is a good place to stop thinking about it.  Over thinking is a terrible thing if you are prone to it. I am.   I think you'll have plenty of opportunities to continue the conversation.

Believing everyone is flirting with you is irrational and smacks of an over inflated ego and sense of self.  Plus it makes you look crazy even if you're right.
AskReddit,etb3grn,t3_cakcx4,1562636055.0,"Flirting is a tricky thing to measure someone by.  Some people flirt with everyone.  Some people flirt to boost their self esteem.  Flirting can mean almost anything.  If you don't know the intent only ask if you're also interested.  It's always better to be upfront and knowing means you can respond without making it awkward or uncomfortable for either of you.  People are forever misunderstanding each other, making assumptions and acting on them.  My SO and I first met 20 years ago and even though we were both interested, neither of us acted on the feeling.  When he saw me again he shared his feelings  for me  20 minutes into our conversation.  It's a pattern of people from my past not being honest about feelings until they don't have them anymore.  I can't preach honesty enough.  It makes life easier to get thru and is attractive to all types.  It projects confidence and self esteem.  Being rejected is a feeling everyone hates and fear of it can paralyze you into never starting any relationship.  Learning to handle it properly is a life skill we all need."

I did figure out there's a limit to the amount of water a person can drink in one sitting then the puking starts.  I think I've  had one kidney infection.  Put me in the hospital.  I was very young.  The last time I had to think about this was 3 years ago when a shitty ob/gyn was giving me a post- op exam.  I mentioned the pain I was still in so she pushed  in on my lower abdomen than told me it was a bladder infection.  No test,  no prescriptions for antibiotics or pain relievers.

The last time they actually rescinded the diagnosis of my previous Dr and wasted months of my time  ignoring my therapist's input  while getting it completely wrong.

AskReddit,et6j0fn,t1_et64avi,1562513693.0,I was 16 and while taking antibiotics I began to feel sick.  My mother informed the Dr and was brushed off repeatedly.  After 2 weeks a rash appeared on my back.  My mom called the Dr and he changed the prescription.  A few weeks later and we get a letter kicking my mom and I out of his practice.  Apparently my mom had words with him when she called about the rash.  When I was in my early 20s I had back surgery.  The surgeon was on the subject of aftercare and he handed me a sample of non-narcotic painkillers to take.  Time comes for the first dose and it  dawns on me he gave zero instructions about how to take them.  I find the drug information on paper inside the box so I'm looking for a recommended dosage and the time to wait between them.  I would up reading the drugs list of ingredients and the first thing on the list is the first thing on my list of known allergies.  If he'd given me any instructions at all I would have gotten sick with no idea why.

I've had many friends with mental health issues and  I've seen what people worse off than me go thru.  The last thing an untreated mental illness resembles is romance.  Only someone who doesn't have any issues would believe that  emotional,   behavioral, neurological, psychological  or any other invisible illness is a desirable state to be in.  They really need to come up with some new  love tropes.  There's too many  examples of behavior no one should emulate."
AskReddit,et5z6wv,t1_et5olvs,1562498036.0,"Depression doesn't require a catalyst.   Your life doesn't have to be a mess.  High functioning means  you  just go thru the motions without the corresponding feelings that tend to accompany them.  Thinking you shouldn't  get help because you can get out of bed  and others can't isn't how illness works.  The people who make commments are usually basing their judgments on personal opinions,  old stereotypes,  and bad anecdotes.  Don't let these people keep you from getting help.  You need support from  the right places.  People with experience and/or training in mental health.  Could be a  psychiatrist for a diagnosis.  A peer run support group.  Online therapy.  Mental health advocates covered by insurance.   Be kind to yourself and do the best you can.  Finding the right help is harder than you'd think.  Again please know  you deserve help just as much as anyone else."
