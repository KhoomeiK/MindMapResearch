depression,fi4zy1w,t3_f6ag6t,1582151912.0,"I can‚Äôt even imagine going a day without brushing my teeth. It becomes obsessive for me sometimes. My friends have described my teeth brushing habits as ‚Äúcrackhead-like.‚Äù I have severe ADD/ Depression and some anxious tendencies and I DEFINITELY understand struggling with personal hygiene. But i guess the one thing I have going for me is a clean mouth üòÇ It definitely feels like a chore sometimes, especially on the days when I can‚Äôt get myself to shower. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point of having clean teeth if the rest of my body is disgusting?‚Äù idk. brains don‚Äôt make sense."
depression,fhfkooh,t3_f2qwaw,1581545343.0,"The fact that you are recognizing what is happening to you and your brain is proof enough that you are not stupid. All you have to do is take the right steps and recovery will come quickly. Have you been tested for ADD/ADHD? I have ADHD and I experienced the same stuff ALL the time before I started treatment. Therapy and medicine have changed my life, HIGHLY recommend. You are not alone :)"
Drugs,fgv4g7l,t1_fgv39zn,1581136855.0,I read something about ketamine being beneficial in small doses for depression so that would be interesting...
Drugs,fgv0du1,t3_f0jbgk,1581133665.0,"In my personal experience, the effects of hallucinogens have been extremely dull compared to the experiences of my friends. I‚Äôve tried multiple times and nothing works for me. I‚Äôve tried going off of my antidepressants weeks in advance of a trip, i‚Äôve detoxed beforehand, and restrained from all drugs in general in order to give myself a chance at feeling things. Maybe i‚Äôm just not talking a high enough dose, but for me, shrooms and acid make me feel like i‚Äôm just realllly high from smoking weed."
