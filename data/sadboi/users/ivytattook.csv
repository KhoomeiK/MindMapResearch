Needafriend,fqzmqwo,t3_glph1k,1589770637.0,"Hello there! I've been struggling with depression since 2005 when I was 17... now at 32...I'm kinda better but still life didn't give me any significant joy. 
Unfortunately... I had many bad days and periods of relapse during my healing but I now just accepted that as part of my reality. I'm an Illustrator I do art. It helps me to cope. I read books too, primarily psychology books. If anyone likes to have honest talks about life, struggles, art, goals, the good, the bad... the whatever... send me a message. 

Take care all. 
Oh I'm female, hello from Greece"

depression,fku60y2,t3_fko0cz,1584543001.0,"This is why I prefer my loneliness. 
It hurts but because no one specific. 
It hurts more being offended, left out, not acknowledged... being cast out like you don't even exist anymore. You don't matter. 

All of your genuine efforts are meaningless. 
Dear person with a fiery heart, keep yourself away from these people. Stand your ground. Work on your self esteem now and distract yourself with something positive like self development and goals. You don't need to prove anything to anyone. Just close the chapter. Good luck. 

If you feel lonely write a message."
