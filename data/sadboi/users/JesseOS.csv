In India, it's used commonly as a breath freshener or in salads. From experience - *do not eat it raw*. Uncooked, they are disgusting."

EatingDisorders,ewfxfk5,t3_cnnzty,1565369392.0,"Hey, OP here. I don't know if this is too late, but I just wanted to say how happy I am that this post reached anybody and seems to be helping people maybe. I haven't been on reddit in quite some time but I have to say this community makes me feel so at home. It reminds me that no matter how hard it may feel, somebody else in the world has gone through the same thing and came out alright."

AnorexiaNervosa,ew93znl,t1_ew8y3gz,1565219294.0,"Yeah, I think that's what it's all about. Like, of course the situation isn't ideal but if you find the silver lining it makes it so much easier. And if things get overwhelming, just remember that it's all temporary and is just another strange experience for the bank."
AnorexiaNervosa,ew7qmib,t3_cn3sij,1565195774.0,"I'm a 13 year old male recovering from anorexia and was told that I was going to be put in a residential facility. Instead, I opted for the faster but more medically oriented hospitalization. I was hospitalized for 2 weeks, and while it was strange, boring, and at times very mentally straining, it was what needed to be done and I would do it all over again (and it wasn't 100% unenjoyable either).

Just take it one day at a time. Honestly, the lack of  any real control of my eating was somewhat freeing. I just got to a point where I was like, **okay, this is gonna happen one way or another so I might as well enjoy it.** I'm not gonna say it was *fun*, and there were definetly things about my experience I would've changed had I known some of the challenges I'd face on my return home, but it was necessary and I found ways to enjoy it. I got to study film, I practiced drawing, I discovered music. When it comes to major changes like hospitalization, you really just have to try to find all of the positives.

Just take it one step at a time. I honestly grew so much as a person because of my experience in the hospital, and while it wasn't all smooth sailing after I left, it proved to me that I could do it."

AskReddit,epakdwm,t3_bu766u,1559129341.0,"A social studies teacher of mine stood my identical twin brother and me up in front of the entire class for them to take measurements as part of a project we were doing. Me being the larger of the two of us at the time, the general consensus was that I was ‚Äúbigger.‚Äù She proceeded to have us take our heights and note them down. Then, she announced that the next day we would be doing a weight check (again in front of the entire class). I remember running home and immediately jumping on the scale. It may not sound like much, but I can‚Äôt help thinking that it contributed to my current struggle with anorexia."
