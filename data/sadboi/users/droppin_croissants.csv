dogs,fqzvb93,t1_fqztwmy,1589776274.0,"They take a lot of work. I've had a shelter dog before, when growing up. We got him when he was 9 months and had him until he was 7 years. He was a great dog but had bad behavioral issues (hated men and all kids [except for me]).

Maybe I phrased it wrong. All dogs require lots of work but more so than others.

I've lived with an aggressive dog (both people and animal) and it was so incredibly draining and stressful. At the moment, I can't handle a dog that already has issues. But if my puppy ends up with behavioral issues down the road, I will take full responsibility and do whatever I can to make her live a healthy and comfortable life. I'd get a trainer and a behaviorist.

We have been friends since mid 2017 and have gotten closer over the years. I've liked her since then and have told her a couple years back, but she was going through a really bad time and the feelings weren't reciprocated; she also wasn't sure if she was bi or not. But about a week ago, I told her again and she told me that she has had feelings for me in the past, but because of what I said, she hadn't come forward. She has come to the realization that she is bi.

We aren't exploring our feelings right now because she is just getting out of a bad relationship and is dealing with shit. But she said the future could hold something for us.

I just turned 18 in March and she will be turning 20 in September.

I know what you mean about the age though! I got into my first relationship at 15 and it was definitely more of an infatuation than love. But even though I am 18, I'm kinda at a loss... because I still am young and I keep thinking that what I'm feeling is nothing, since I'm a wee baby."

You definitely should! A small pill can make such a difference. My mom used to have insanely bad anxiety, to the point where she couldn't drive across this bridge (which led to her job at the time, the mall, etc), so people would have to drive her across the bridge.

I do think you should have more boundaries with your boy though. Initiate and end rough play on *your* terms. He's still a puppy and GSDs are a very mouthy breed, but you can teach him to be softer with his bite.

Dogs are smart. My aunt's dog, when he was 1 and about 70lbs at the time, I played rough with him all the time. He knew that he could play rough with me but he needed to be gentle around my older step-grandmother. He sensed it. But I would supervise play between your pup and your cousin. In case things get too rough, you are able to break it up.
