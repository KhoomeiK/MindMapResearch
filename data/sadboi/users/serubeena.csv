I really don't believe people usually mean anything bad, it just might come off wrong at times to others.

Although, there's of course nothing wrong with being hyped. It's just a bit sad when some completely give up on a game solely because it ""took too long"".

If it took 7+ years though, that's understandable I suppose.

At the same time, I guess it's unfair of me to have some sort of ""limit"" on when something ceases to be interesting to someone else."

I don't like how it feels like that's the ""norm"" either, and it makes me very concerned for the future of games.

My fianc√© is much more of a gamer than I am, and he frequently has this concern about the industry as well. He really only supports games and projects he feels doesn't try to sell you ""solutions"" to problems in-game or things the company / developer ""forgot"" to add just so they can ask you to buy more features, items, DLCs with very little change to the game, etc.

At least that makes me feel a little better, to know that at least some try to support a change, but yeah, it's very disheartening that it feels like it's becoming the ""norm""."
Deltarune,fopwqqz,t1_fopks5u,1587974718.0,"Yeah, I suppose that it's fairly common in the gaming industry to release ""bits and pieces"" / patches and DLCs fairly soon after one another, so to be fair, I suppose people aren't wrong to think this.

AskWomen,f606sgk,t3_dpxlyj,1572607799.0,"Yes. One since 4th grade. I was friends with her because I had no other friends, and I thought you were supposed to stand by them no matter what.
Or at least that's what she said.

She tore off my first stuffed toy bunny's head in front of me and just laughed, then said ""that's not a big deal, is it? It's just a toy"".
I just nodded and choked back tears.
My grandpa, who had died recently, gave me that toy, and she knew that.
My mom didn't let her stay at my house anymore.

She retaliated by telling her mom I had accused my friend's step-dad about being a pedo, so now I couldn't go to her house.

(I never said that, I just said he seemed creepy and scary after he yelled and screamed at my friend at the dinner table when she took one more meatball, and I wasn't even allowed to be by the table. He reminded me of my step-dad, so I was just worried for my friend's safety and told her he seemed weird. Turns out he was abusing her and her mom, though).

She didn't let me spend time with or even look at a guy I had a crush on, because ""he was hers"" (he didn't like her one bit and didn't try to hide it, they were never in a relationship).

She would stop being my friend if I did.

She forced me to like the same things as her, because otherwise I wasn't ""worthy of her time"".

Just similar stuff like this all the time.

Stopped being friends with her in 9th grade after she forcefully tried to make out with me at my house (I know, it was a real wtf moment), and the day after in school just suddenly was best friends with someone else and pretended I never met her.

Met her like 5-6 years later at a bar.

Proceeds to tell me about her abusive relationships and how she cheated on all the guys before setting fire to their shit and leaving.

She tried to convince me I should bring my fianc√© to a party where ""it's not her fault if she ends up banging him"".

(My fianc√© wanted absolutely nothing to do with her or the party, lol).

Noped the f**k out and never spoke to or saw her again. She definitely hadn't changed.

Another one was my first ever best friend. She was nice in the beginning, though. But after 3rd grade and I moved schools, we never really spoke.

Suddenly she messages me on Facebook. First it's nice chats.
Then she asks for money. For ""rent"".

I barely have any money myself, but since it was rent, why not? 

I send some money, and notice it's her mom's Swish account. Weird. But maybe she stays with her, I guess.
But again, she's like 21, surely her mom isn't keeping her money for her?

Anyway, we keep talking. She says she's really into bingo and gambling. Asks for more money.

Nope.

I obviously say no. She says okay, but every other day asks for more money for ""rent"".

I decide to try to meet her and maybe TRY to get some kind of friendship other than me being her personal ATM, so we set a date.

Five minutes before we're supposed to meet: ""sorry I can't come. Maybe next time.""

This kept happening several times.

One time I was just adamant on meeting her, though, so I set a date and she agreed.

I stand there, in pouring rain, no umbrella since the weather had been sunny for 7+ days and there was no indication of rain whatsoever when I left, my phone barely working anymore, nowhere to stand (there was a festival and you could only sit in a caf√© or shop if you bought something, and even then there were people blocking the doors because it was crowded everywhere), and I wait 45+ minutes for her outside a caf√©.

No signs of her anywhere.

Mind you, I also have fairly severe anxiety and social phobia, so this was torture. I saw people looking at me just standing in the rain, almost on the verge of tears as I couldn't get my phone to work. Felt like they were weirded out by me, but again, maybe just anxiety.

Text her. No answer. Call her. No answer. Finally after 30 more minutes, she answers.

""Oh, I'm busy. Maybe another time. By the way, do you have 20 dollars?""

I hung up, walked to the bus stop and went home. Looked out the window and just stared.

Got off at my stop, walked home, closed apartment door and just burst into tears.
Blocked her on everything, but not before seeing a message: ""So you're just never gonna talk to me ever again over some f***ing money?""

Uh, no, you idiot. I'm never gonna talk to you again because you literally only used me as your personal ATM because you knew me from like 3rd grade, and then bailed out on an actual friendship."

I got to do basically everything I wanted, the only requirement being I helped cleaning and looking after my smaller siblings once in a while.

I never went out much except for dates at the weekends with my boyfriend (now fianc√©), but I was dependent and did my own things as well as spend time with the family a lot.

So when she moved, by ages 21-24, I had to live with my ""in-laws"" with my fianc√© (me and my fiance aren't married, but we like to call them in-laws anyway, lol)

I couldn't get a job in my own city, so that's why I had to move in with them. My ""MIL"" helped me out so much, and I'll always be grateful. She still helps out whenever she can, she's the best.

When we lived with them, we just lived in his childhood bedroom and got the whole upstairs area for ourselves.
It was pretty nice.
We weren't really bothered, all we had to do was clean the entire floor at least once a week and eat dinner with them, so yeah, basically just standard rules.
They were really kind and even made dinner for us, so really, nothing to complain about.
Me and my fianc√© got to go out for dates or do whatever we wanted, just as long as we were quiet if it got late. (We never really went out late, though, as we aren't exactly ""party people"" or want to go out really late by any means. We're both nerds, lol).

I coped basically by working hard and getting the best grades in our class, so I got praised a lot by my teachers whom I really liked. I was even so fast ahead in some projects and classes I got to do crosswords and puzzles instead of work, since I had already done it.
I was a ""typical"" shy, extremely introverted nerd, so of course I got severely bullied as well, and at age 13 had a breakdown and had to go to the psych ward for attempted suicide.
