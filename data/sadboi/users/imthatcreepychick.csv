I wasn't buying it. Had some time to dig a little. Oh. Holy. Crap. Way back in 1981 he had apparently raped a young woman, I think she was 20-21. Then he went back the next day n strangled her. They had known each other already n he was afraid she would rat him out, n he got 30yrs. Did his 30yrs, got out got a job, n has absolutely no problem getting chicks on the back of his Harley. Seemed to have that ""Just aggressive enough"" attitude to snag ya lol. Never would have suspected finding that out. That's not even the worst one."
morbidquestions,fg65y5a,t1_fg63pt4,1580555351.0,"Just thrown in the mix. We had no idea that she had the HS until I finally was diagnosed with it a couple years ago. I can look back now and know that was one thing that spurred lots of her sickness, and then I feel like it assaulted her immune system so bad getting mediocre antibiotic treatment (think from the 60'- at least '89 when she had her first heart attack. The MRSA was already present, but it is believed that the NF may have been nosocomial. Through the 90's is when it got rough. I was 17 when her femoral blew, and it was my Senior year of high school. My daughter was born June 2000, I had my 1st back surgery (laminectomy S1 level) on January 4th 2001, my mom got an abscess on her spinal cord 3 days later, went to let our dog out n collapsed n was paralyzed from her stomach down. Both urine and fecal bags, IV meds, skin care for her, all the care of a hospital patient with my dad n I doing the care. Overseen by her team of in home Drs. My daughter n I lived back at home at that time until after she died. The damage done to her brain over the course of her life, and medications which were mostly pain relief n antibiotics then the stuff to counteract the bad effects, really took it's toll. She was a feisty one though."
NoStupidQuestions,fg65ajg,t3_ewzwwt,1580554368.0,"Yes, mine absolutely is. I am in the process of fighting to get disability right now. I do have physical reasons also, but I was still able to work a little bit. But I teeter on the edge of being hospitalized depending on the day. I can wake up n not do anything except use the toilet all day. Won't eat, never any type of solid sleep schedule, side effects of psychiatric medications can be gnarly too. Then other days I am ravenous with hunger. I am not even stable on my meds. They have to keep raising it, n the side effects are notorious for rash. Only rash I get is from the corners of my lips down to my chin. Itchy scaly red. It makes me itch like crazy. Gotta try n find a new one. Last one I tried almost ended it for me,  very depressed, in bed crying for days on end. It's not always even about the mental illness it self, it can be the side effects. I itch so so bad, but I am not making suicide plans, I am not getting domestically violent in my home, I am not out avoiding life by partying. I was a fantastic bartender for years, n used to get dressed up cute for work every night. Now I can barely get dressed to go to the store. I used to love being out n about, now it's hard sometimes to even walk outside. I would rather have twice as much physical pain to not have to go through the brain stuff. Mind you I have already had 2 back surgeries one of which was a 5 level spinal fusion with 2 rods n 10 screws holding it together. 2 carpal tunnel surgeries, (one is coming back) I go 3 times a year for shots in my very low back 1 on each side. As of November I now have pinched nerves and bulging discs in my neck. Starting physical therapy, but don't know how ibam gonna be able to keep 2-3 appointments scheduled every week on top of my therapist every week, then psych n neurologist every 2-3 months. Trying to keep all of the straight, inside a messed up brain is tricky. Along with my disability case, I have to keep up with that. All the paperwork, all the domestic female crap at home. Not my strong point as the electric got shut off for 2 days earlier this month because I paid the gas bill twice n not electric. Payment plans that if we miss a payment it gets shut off. So yeah, mental illness can make it very difficult if not impossible to work. Unfortunately there is no real way to quantify how my own personal symptoms feel to me. Like my Dr can't diagnose me with ""level 8 Bipolar 1 rapid cycling"", a ""level 10 Borderline personality disorder"" etc. So it becomes a he said she said between how you actually truly feel vs how your doctors, family, friends, bosses n coworkers interpret how you really feel."

morbidquestions,fg63hm6,t1_fg62w38,1580551652.0,"Nah, mom was a special case. She also had to take hundreds of mg of diphenhydramine to counteract her reaction to some of the antibiotics she had to take. Not sure what the mg of the promethazine was (the little round red pills, she has been dead for 14 years so it not relevant to today's time necessarily) but yeah, necrotizing fasciitis, MRSA, Hidradenitis, abscesses on her spinal column. She is literally in medical books. First living patient to go through the Roto rooter procedure, after in the middle of angioplasty the balloon broke n she crashed. They did the athirectomy,  which did work,but they used too big of a catheter in her femoral artery causing it to rupture within 12 hours and almost bleed out. UofM hospital sure knew how to cover their ass on that. So yeah, they figured out which size catheter to use for the procedure they do now based on what happened to my mom, and I am sure plenty of other experimental procedures. Add all that to 6 strokes, 7 heart attacks, Bells Palsy, Degenerative Disc Disease, Diabetes... at least she didn't have cancer."
morbidquestions,fg62sce,t1_fg62h4e,1580550607.0,Interesting because my mom had to take promethazine with her morphine to keep from throwing up. She had no other pain options. She never od'd for the record.
unpopularopinion,fg62leq,t3_ex2pqi,1580550321.0,"What happens if a couple people came to Canada in the late 1600's from England. They settled there for a while. Next generation born there in Canada come down to Detroit and lay down their roots. My several times great grandfather was born in Detroit in 1742. Now the people that came from England were mixes of Irish, Scottish, Scandinavian, French, and English brought in from there. Other side came to Quebec from France and settled then migrated south to Ontario. Great grandparents killed in Halifax Harbor Explosion. So if we go back as far as we can and base it off that, I would be Viking American. Oldest recorded relative in my tree was a Viking in the 9-10th century. Or am I just really really white?"

Family all over, so she basically only added a handful of family n some friends. To share pictures as they grow, so grandma's can leave messages for them. It's not a public ""look at my kid"" free for all. Sadly it turns out to be more important than she thought. Her husband (one of my best friends, I knew him first) used to record messages with both the girls n share them n save them... He died suddenly just over a year ago. All of those precious memories are stored ""safely"" on their Facebook's. Their older daughter has one she started, but she can't access the original yet.

AskReddit,fg609ua,t3_ewtwe9,1580546953.0,"I have a couple, based on what type of moment came up. When I was 17 was so horribly depressed I had to take 2 weeks out in Feb. of my Senior year in high school, and go to the psych hospital. Going back to school and people drilling me about what it was like, n not asking me how I was, I got extremely resentful, towards people I never should have. Then I was 36, at work as a waitress, n start feeling weak, nauseas, went to sit down n felt like I was having a heart attack. Literally called my bf n told him to grab a couple things n come pick me up. Went to the ER all tests were going well, stayed overnight n it was diagnosed that I had generalized anxiety disorder. Also have Bipolar1 rapid cycling, and Borderline personality disorder. Those came later. I have always been full of rage and can very much be a Dr. Jekyll n Mr. Hyde. I can literally be everything somebody wants one minute, and spit em out like venom the next. I know I can be a down right horrible, selfish person sometimes, n have literally no true concept of the true consequences of behaviors (that I do not do anymore, like cocaine, alcohol, hypersexuality, reckless spending sprees). I can still get a bit bad with money but I don't go out partying sleeping around any more. Hindsight being 20/20... My life has essentially been 1 big cluster of ""This is definitely not normal"" moments. Not done yet either. I am 44, n know I need to go inpatient for a couple weeks. Sounds odd, but it's a good time of year for me, here in the next couple weeks. I had an ""episode"" the end of August and was sanctioned for a week, but just like always I talked my way out of it, while coming down off what the gave me to sleep. I was out in just over 12 hours. That was my latest moment. Still trying to navigate through it all. Absolutely sucks."
