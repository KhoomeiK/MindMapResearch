piercing,etp0wvm,t1_etp0lzz,1563042750.0,I don't think he wants me to get any pericing or tatoos but wants tatoos himself. I think he is trying to talk me out of it.

Dogtraining,etk0ong,t1_etjq4wj,1562885970.0,I am really glad I asked this question because I would have never known any of this information. This is my first service dog. I'm glad I'm learning this stuff. I never realized the damage they could do.

kittens,essk658,t1_esq014h,1562253235.0,Surprisingly I didn't see any fleas or tics at all. I'm glad you took in the kitten. I feel bad for all kittens in a bad condition
ChronicIllness,espk9vc,t3_c8pl08,1562185616.0,I don't want to be rude but what is FOMO?? I've never heard of the aberration before
kittens,espdx9a,t1_espdj8q,1562182871.0,She walked up too me. I like to think she found me for a reason since I do suffer from quite a few medical problems. It will be an amazing distraction. She seems really thankful.
kittens,espday3,t1_espd3xz,1562182599.0,I will after her vet appointment which will be after Monday.
kittens,esp6h1a,t3_c8omf7,1562179625.0,Awwe. I've rescued several kittens. They are so cute! I always had a hard time finding black kittens homes.
kittens,esp4omy,t3_c8q635,1562178867.0,UPDATE) I took her home and I have a mama cat. She took her right in. Ever since becoming a moma she has been 'catnapping' other kittens. I believe this is because she lost a few of her own. She is taking very good care of the kitten. We named her Nyx. We are making an appointment asap.
kittens,esp4axf,t1_esoyo57,1562178702.0,Oh my gosh I love the kitten lady üòÇ. Thankyou. I will wash her feet with dawn. She has been eating wet cat food.
kittens,esouchr,t1_esopilx,1562174341.0,No. I live in a small farming town. The other local office is closed and there is not another place too take her. The police stations will just send her to animal control and she is so sweet that I don't want her to be killed.
kittens,esoogzf,t3_c8q635,1562171518.0,My vet office is closed for the 4th of July and I found this poor baby. Her fur is just peeling off with like a layer if dry skin and her nose looks sunburned. She is eating and drinking but I don't know how to help with the fur peeling off. She already lost most of the fur on her head. She has a bad cold and her feet was covered on motor oil. She found me outside in a trailer park.

piercing,eoxaflm,t1_eox9l0h,1558921236.0,I had it done at the end of February . I think it is either stainless steel or titanium. I use antibacterial hand soap too clean it. The bump was small when I got it done and I just assumed it was swelling.
piercing,eox8e6v,t3_btfyb6,1558920469.0,I had to clean the jewelry and I can put the jewelry in the bubble thing now which burns when it happens. Sometimes it had a fluid that seeps out. I am not sure if there may be a cyst or not?

dogs,eovf5gv,t3_bt92dn,1558894182.0,"Thus actually scares me because I have a SDiT. I saw a fake one when I was working (I didn't have my dog because she is not trained enough) and it broke my heart. It was obviously fake due to the fact it was on a retractable leash and made a huge mess. It was pulling and running up to people and my manager was too scared to ask them to leave.

People please leave you pets at home. It makes people like me who rely on a dog to function life alot harder."
