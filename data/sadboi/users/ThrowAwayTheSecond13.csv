Advice,fomuc5q,t3_g8adwg,1587904093.0,"If they're active on other social media, their behavior is strange but I'm gonna tell you about my situation.
I'm actually someone who won't answer, I suffer from severe depression, I isolate myself a lot and don't answer people a lot or frequently.
Maybe I'm afraid I'd loose them or disappoint or I don't deserve happiness so I rather push them away before they do so with me.
Recently my best friend sent me a message, saying she understood me but she asked if I don't like her or appreciate her anymore...so I don't think she does understand.
I have a lack of appreciation for myself.
It must be very hard for others to understand and I don't expect them to, it's my own fault.
I've been asked many times why I don't just answer people, I read about behavior that is linked to negative experiences which causes individual to refuse or become anxious performing those tasks.
I had a difficult childhood to say the least, I don't know if that's what caused this however.
But I'm only active on Whatsapp if it's about work and nowhere else where I could have contact with people who mean something to me.
This is just an insight on a person who does this a lot."

The situation seems especially worse since she is even trying to hide the truth so there's nothing the police could do if she kept lying if they show up.
Best advice would be to watch over the situation and when another yelling match occurs, call the cops, not for abuse reasons but because of the noise, it simply was too loud, that's a violation after all.
And maybe they'll stumble upon the abuse themselves then."

EDAnonymous,fjyyxxx,t3_ffivvy,1583707597.0,"I can relate to this so much!! 
Just realized I probably only developed am Ed because of my depression, I want others to notice I'm sick and unwell so desperately.
There are days where I feel like I can get out and I'm faking everything and there are others where I purge because of an apple. I can't go on like this but like you described I need it.
As I graduated last year and started working I lost purpose and found it in my ed.
I wanna scream for help but I don't.
And I'm 21...I know an Ed can happen to anyone but I feel pathetic to get one at my age, I can talk to nobody out of shame and fear they'll do something and because I want THEM to notice .
I'd love to talk to someone who would understand but I don't wanna sound creepy xD I really hope you are able to get out of this eventually, take care üíï"

If I feel like I can't control my intake at all and eat way too much as if in a haze or so much that I feel sick then I binged."
EDAnonymous,fjyxyiy,t3_ffjdq8,1583706978.0,"Never after a binge but what you describe reminds me of depersonalisation, something that occurs from time to time where you feel like you aren't yourself and it's pretty strange to see your body act but not under your control at all.
Maybe look into that? I've read most people experienced depersonalisation at least 3-4 times in their lives.
Please take care ‚ù§"
EDAnonymous,fjyxofo,t3_ffjim1,1583706802.0,"YUP. This bitch over here.
I was overweight my whole life and bullied pretty badly, simple cause to develop an Ed? Hell no because I didn't, I had the confidence of a model but the appearance of a sea cow....
The thing that got me into this is most likely the realization of eating too much sweets (risking to get diabetes even tho none of my family members have it) and the comments of my coworker and him touching and squeezing my arm a lot + the compliments I got on my weight loss from others that kept me going.
Now I'm fucking sick and Idk what to do without my Ed anymore."

Although I don't even talk out loud or tell anyone so who should even pity me? And whenever I start to talk myself into pitying me, I immediately hate on me: ""Sinking into pitying yourself again?you're worthless, you don't deserve to cry or feel that way, other people have it so much harder than you""..then I think about rape victims, abusive households etc. and feel bad.

Was bullied, grew taller and could sneak into the ""she's overweight but not obese looking"" radar.
But recently my body image got worse since I started working at the pizza shop, I was yet to reach my highest weight and going ""obese"" ( right at the limit of overweight ).
A workmate then asked me what my weight was and my mom told me ""all you're eating is sweets lately, haven't you noticed?"" and anxiety kicked in.
I feared getting obese and even diabetes at that point.
So I snapped and made my tradition of punishing myself through starving a couple days into my lifestyle 
I'm 7 kilos down from what I was at originally but I feel worse once I see the weight increasing even by a little.
I hate it but as long as I'm loosing, I don't think I will stop obsessing about numbers."

If you're severely overweight ( like me ),
people don't take you serious and you'll get even more depressed if you see the looks some people give you fueling your ED even more.
Best thing is, you're suffering alone unless you want people to tell you to stop which is the least favorable...I want to cry so bad sometimes.

I'm overweight almost obese even ( 5""7 and 185 lbs ), it wouldn't even cross anyone's mind that I could have an ED except for binge eating maybe even though I won't allow myself to eat over 500 calories a day, constantly think about my weight, tried to puke before, starve occasionally, worry about what others might think of my fat body and just obsess about bony bodies all the time.
But nobody would even care or diagnose me so I'm just gonna deal with it on my own until someone literally forces food down my throat."
