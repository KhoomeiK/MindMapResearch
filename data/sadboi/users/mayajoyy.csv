Reach out to friends and perhaps drop-in peer counseling if they have that at your school (assuming that is a dorm room in college). Also research clubs that can help! There's an Asian/South Asian mental health group on campus, maybe see if there's one of those. You're becoming your own person, which is really hard, but you've got so much to be proud about. Keep going!"

In all seriousness, if you hate your major and you're not having a good time, switch! It takes a lot of guts to do that, but if that's the right decision for you, do it. Please don't be pressured into your major by other people. At the end of the day, it's YOUR life to live how you want. I was where you are just a year ago. It may seem really dark right now, but when you walk across the stage at your department graduation it'll all be worth it. Good luck and go Bears üíôüíõ"

I know in catholicism everyone is a sinner, yadda yadda, but in Protestant religions I think it's different. If they really believe being gay is a sin, shouldn't they not care because Jesus absolved us or something like that? Gotta wonder what kind of mental gymnastics people use just to rationalize their beliefs under scrutiny."
