It was so much I have post traumatic symptoms as a result.

Also do you research before buying anything from shops!  If the lowest prices you see on SW are lower than the NPC shop list price, I don't bother restocking in it.

I've been at it a month-month and a half and have nearly 4.25 mil in the bank; I only bought premium just last week.  I restock in items I see frequently appearing at the Faerieland Employment Agency (make sure you do your 5 jobs a day there too, great way to make money if you pick your jobs carefully) and make a fairly steady profit.  I haven't even bothered advertising on the shop boards. 

Battledome is also great because you can win codestones which can net you big money very fast.  And many of the other prizes have high rarity indexes so you can squirrel them away for when Charity Corner finally happens.

Who wants to bet that if you did let them have the baby while still under your roof that they would find it ""too overwhelming"" within a week and the baby would ""trigger [boyfriend's] anxiety"" because it cries a lot and you would be stuck with full time childcare for a baby that you didn't want and isn't even yours?

Hell even if they move out I guarantee they'd be calling OP within the same time frame trying to get her to do shit for them and basically parent their baby for them because it would be neglected otherwise.  

I'll reiterate what others have said.  Push up the moveout date.  Premature births happen and god forbid she had the baby a little early and you would be stuck with trying to evict them with a newborn while they use every manipulation tactic to guilt you into not going through with it. 

Stop taking care of them now.  Let them start cooking, shopping, etc for themselves.  Don't let them sit around and play videogames and (apparently) copulate all day while you do everything for them on your own dime."

relationships,fkn5cfe,t1_fkmxdft,1584354175.0,"Just to offer some quick advice for both you and OP:
If there are any friends with licenses already that can teach you how to drive and take you to the DMV to get your license, that's also a good option.  You need insurance first to get one, but depending on your state and with a little help from friends (or in OP's case, the counsellor) you should be able to find some cheap insurance that will hold you over for now until you can get better insurance. 

I am actually teaching two of my friends how to drive this summer.  They're Chinese and one is getting a license here, and they don't know the first thing about how things work in the US, so I'm glad to be there to help them.  This may be an option for you guys as well."
