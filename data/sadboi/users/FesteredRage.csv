It‚Äôs also hotter, in the desert, and everything is run by casinos. It‚Äôs also very dead looking. And on the street I live on, shootings have happened. Nothing like that that I know of has happened in Burbank. Also unlike Vegas, Burbank cools down at night, and most places are a short walking distance away.

Basically, Vegas is hell, and Burbank is closer to being a slice of heaven in comparison. Albeit a very pricey one."

Speaking of which, LA has plenty of those. Sure, every big city has those, but those neighborhoods are probably the only ones you could afford to live in. 

Also, I don‚Äôt see how tall buildings makes a city good. Detroit has tall buildings. Miami has beaches. Salt Lake City has mountains. Does that make any of them good? No. Just like Los Angeles isn‚Äôt good just because it has all of that. 

If you were to really explore any of the cities that I mentioned outside the main areas and hot tourist spots, you‚Äôd see just how flawed they really are, as well as how run down and dangerous certain spots are. Same applies to LA.  Yes once again this applies to a lot of places, but you guys are making this city out to be something it‚Äôs not: a great city. They‚Äôre far from great, especially Detroit, Miami and Vegas. Hell, even my home city has its fair share of problems. 

All I‚Äôm saying is, worshipping these places and treating them like holy ground, or misunderstood instead of wanting these cities to improve and viewing them as they actually are as a whole instead of only paying attention to the parts of these cities you like and putting it on a pedestal is never a good idea. 

There are reasons LA is hated. Reasons I didn‚Äôt even bring up. Hell, I used to live near it, so I‚Äôd know. It‚Äôs not the worst city ever, but it‚Äôs not that great either. I‚Äôm not trying to be a buzzkill, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs not as glamorous as you think it is."
