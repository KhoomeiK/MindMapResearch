JoeBiden,fjluuak,t1_fjlq8vd,1583454977.0,"That's just not true,

In a 1972 letter to a local newspaper — which was recently resurfaced by Chelsea Summers at the New Republic — Sanders wrote that he supported abolishing ""all laws dealing with abortion, drugs, sexual behavior (adultery, homosexuality, etc.)"" as part of his campaign for Vermont governor.


Sanders has carried many of these positions to this day. He was one of the few federal lawmakers to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act, the federal ban on same-sex marriages, in the 1990s. And while he told Time's Jay Newton-Small in March that he has no current stance on marijuana legalization (but backs medical marijuana), he characterized the war on drugs as costly and destructive.

In 1983, as mayor of Burlington, he signed a Gay Pride Day proclamation calling it a civil rights issue. He was one of just 67 members in the House of Representatives to vote against the Defense of Marriage Act, a politically tough decision he prides himself on and points to as a key progressive bona fide. Sanders opposed Don’t Ask Don’t Tell in 1993, another President Bill Clinton-era policy, and supported civil unions in Vermont in 2000."

WaterdeepDragonHeist,fftz2ne,t3_ev7is9,1580230846.0,"Consider using the following downtime activity that I got from ""Durban's guide to tavern keeping"" from DMSguild.

Brew beer:
Frequency: No more than 5 concurrent batches Prerequisite: Brewery
Brewing your own ale is a sure-fire way to turn extra profits, assuming your brew is good. Each day that you spend on this activity costs you 1 gp in ingredients (e.g. bitters, fruit, spices, coffee beans, etc). Note down the brew date and any special ingredients you included. Exactly 40 days later, roll on the Brewing Beer table to determine the results.


1-10 something went wrong with the brewing process, when you crack open the keg a dangerous mold forms and attacks using the black pudding stats.

11-20 Uh oh, looks like you used contaminated yeast for this batch and all following batches. Any batches still fermenting are ruined

21-40 Not bad, but something isn't right. Roll a d6, on a 1-3 the brew is okay and you turn no profit on it. on 4-6 it's serviceable and your business earns 1d8 x 5 gp from selling it. however your brewery attracts the attention of a yeastling(stats are in the book)

41-80 the brew is fine and you earn 1d8 x 5 from selling it.

81-90 perfection! your business earns 4d8 x 5 from selling this brew, reroll any ones that you roll.

91-100 you doubt you’ll ever brew anything to equal this again. It’s heaven in a glass. Your business earns 6d8 x 5 gp from selling the brew, but you can’t use any downtime activities during the next tenday as you’re too busy enjoying your own wares.

hope this gave you some inspiration/ insight into how you can form your own tavern rules."
