Coinbase is one of many exchanges, places you can buy and sell your cryptocurrencies. It's one of the most popular for many reasons. 

HODL literally means HOLD (you hold your bitcoins without intention of selling anytime soon) it is based off a typo back in the day that was adopted as part of the BTC jargon.
