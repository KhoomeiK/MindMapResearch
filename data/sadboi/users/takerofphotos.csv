bipolar,fmq37hp,t3_fwoyq4,1586292047.0,"I have found myself spiraling out around 5pm and also noticing my body cycling more than normal. The only thing that is keeping me sane is a little bit of exercise (Which I am the worst at doing consistently) and telling myself that what I am feeling is ok and to breath. The isolation is the worst part but distractions are a necessity. If you are in an area that you can take a walk, that really helps me. I also notice that if I take my meds even a few hours late, my cycles get wacky and I have been worse at taking them on time because of the lapsing days at home.

They would chase kids and I even saw a few who were nipped at. Unprovoked may I add. It was sort of funny most days. 

The admins did nothing about it because they, “added to the esthetic” of the pond. But I should also mention the road that ran around the pond. Years later I heard that one of the swans got ran over, I’m not sure what happened to the other.

AskReddit,fggw9z6,t1_fggrkoc,1580770979.0,"Thank you for this, i don’t get why people are shitting on Orlando as a whole here. It honestly is not that bad, I went to high school across the street from Universal on Turkey Lake literally across the street, we had Harry Potter’s Castle, Dueling Dragons (RIP) and Jurassic Park World echoing through our open air school’s rafters and everyday it was only school traffic, granted this the mid 2000’s, but still driving the road today I don’t see much of a change. The tourists mostly use some obviously dedicated roads running into Universal or I Drive from I4. Unless you live in Pine Hills you really don’t have to get into all that mess. 

Most tourists really don’t have a need to drive to the end of Sand lake heading away from I4, because then you just hit Dr.Phillips and your are in the neighborhoods. You can make a left and head to Lake Buena Vista, but the infrastructure has directed more cars I4 west to the Disney exits. 

I guess what I am getting at is once you are in a residential area it is pretty clear. 

Buuuuttt, since the 90’s so many people have moved there and ever since the fountain in lake eola got fixed, more and more people have moved here...It is actually shocking. Getting to Millennia Mall is damn near impossible (the i4 east exit has 2 right turn lanes BTW soooo don’t get stuck in the giant line that backs up on the right) 

Just like every growing or major city it has its shit and it has its gold. It’s a theme park town and I’ve seen most every change they have made to accommodate the flow of tourists and residence. Bottom line, it could be a looooooootttt worse.

I kept the build pretty simple for this shoot. We had a lot to fit into a 12 hour day and I had setups that required Steadicam, Handheld, and Fisher 10 Dolly work. On the day the shoot went very smooth thanks to a detailed prep day at the camera house. 

I wanted to add a few key points to anyone interested or getting started in camera department...

1. Don’t skip a prep day (even when production can’t swing the budget for your prep day rate)...it will do more harm than good if you don’t get your gear in order. 

2. Check the front and rear optics, do a lens test and measure out your focus then check a seimens focus chart.

3. Establish and test your camera data workflow during prep. If you don’t have a DIT or a Data Manager don’t let your footage get lost in the sauce or corrupt. 

4. Label Label Label

Also, Listen and learn from your 1st and 2nd AC if you are starting as a utility."
