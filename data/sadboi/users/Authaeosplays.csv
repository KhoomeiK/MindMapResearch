We’re expected to be able to deal with anything by ourselves easily, a family member just died? We’re supposed to just shake it off, or we aren’t considered manly. In the eyes of others, we aren’t allowed to show emotions, and that can be a really scary experience."

ShitPostCrusaders,ex2m7ee,t3_cr1kuo,1565971747.0,"Let’s be honest here, Shinobu is the strongest character in the all of part 4 if not in JJBA as a whole. For starters, she’s the one who killed Stray Cat meaning that Shinobu > Stray Cat. Now when Kira Yoshikage fought Stray Cat, they were on pretty equal footing. Even if Kira barely won, Shinobu absolutely destroyed Stray Cat meaning that Shinobu > Kira Yoshikage. Now if we go back a little, Kira killed Shigechi meaning that Kira > Shigechi and thus Shinobu > Shigechi.  And well if we go back to Shigechi vs Josuke AND Okuyasu, they struggled to beat him so Shigechi is almost twice as strong as Josuke and Okuyasu individually, meaning that Shinobu is, you guessed it, way stronger than Josuke and Okuyasu. Now, some other pOwErScAlErS claim that Bug Eaten is the strongest character due to Josuke AND Jotaro struggling against him, however Josuke is individually way weaker than Shigechi. This means that Josuke is stronger than Jotaro as proven in the fight at the start I. which Josuke was clearly winning. Now I shall give a more comprehensive power scale, Shinobu>Stray Cat=Kira>Shigechi>Josuke> Okuyasu>Jotaro. So, it is my belief that Shinobu is the strongest character in part 4 by a WIDE margin and again, possibly the strongest character in all of JoJo’s."
