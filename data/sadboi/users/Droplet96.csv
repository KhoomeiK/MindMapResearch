Basically I have one that’s all about voicing and voice leadings and just exercise. Then I have what’s basically the real book just a different brand. Also a tiny little book that just shows some common voicings of the diatonic and 6th chords. Sort of like a little pocket reference. And then I also got a huge jazz theory book I’ve been attacking and that’s been a ton of fun. I didn’t understand modes very well until earlier and then after studying the chapter I figured out this super easy pattern and now I can play any of the modes in any scale! (Not super quickly obviously I need to develop better muscle memory and automatic recall.) I’m loving the books though. I was always worried I wouldn’t progress fast enough because I didn’t have a super good teacher, but honestly I think I’m learning more with the books because I’m so motivated"

Anxietyhelp,fi1keyf,t1_fhzox6a,1582059465.0,"Sure. Haha so for my whole life ive wanted to be a musician, and really dive deep into that world and learn it in depth. I’ve been told since I was a child by literally everyone who I’ve come across in that world that I’m unusually talented. Like my piano teacher when I was probably 7 literally made it a point to come to my house to talk to my parents in person to tell them “hey like we really don’t see this kind of natural ability very often, and she should really really keep doing this. Like this is a rare thing and I don’t have any other students like this”. (The only reason I even know about this is because my mom told me about it when I was older and doubting it I had any potential. I still doubt it and i feel like an arrogant Asshole even saying that stuff, but that’s just how it’s been). A lot of my younger life was chaos and horrifying abuse (hence why I’m in CPTSD subreddit lol) but now, I’m in my mid twenties. I have a TON of emotional and financial support from my grandparents. I’m back in school, for music, and I have a standing offer from a really good school that if I want to go back they’ll waive my tuition and board (so, free college level music education). I have a stable healthy living situation, a really nice keyboard set up downstairs hooked up to a laptop with a bunch of music software, and I’m in private composition lessons. ALL this. After a lifetime of wanting to make music so bad I didn’t really care if I died if I wasn’t able to, and way too often I get hamstrung by doubt. It’s just all those old CPTSD emotions and coping mechanisms that were true at one point, that had to become engrained for me to survive the situation. I.e. feeling trapped, feeling like pursuing my dreams is impossible and the impulse to repress them so it isn’t painful, feeling scared of the judgment of people around me, feeling scared to put myself put myself out there in any way, because of what kind of abusive backlash it’ll bring. All of that. And sometimes im frustrated because the part of myself that is present in the current situation wants to get up, exercise eat a healthy breakfast and then bang out a ton of work on music. And often that’s what I do. But then I’ll fall off, and that old CPTSD shit will take over, and I’ll find myself stuck in a fog and unable to concentrate on anything, fighting an impulse to just get in bed. Lol 

I have to keep reminding myself, it’s not my fault my brain is like this, and actually,it shows a tremendous amount of strength to fight all these symptoms most people can’t even imagine and still try to pursue your dream. (I feel like that applies to you too). Being forgiving with myself for the times when it’s hard, and celebrating how impressive it actually is to survive what I’ve been through and still be doing this right now has helped a lot. And tbh another thing that’s helped me is medicating for it. I was resistant to medication for years because of all the horror stories ive heard about SSRIs. But it’s funny, as it turned out I actually don’t meet the diagnostic criteria for depression, or for bipolar, or the other common ones they check for. I did meet all the criteria for ADHD though hahaha. So I’ve been testing out using meds to help me on the really hard days and so far it’s really changed my life. I’m trying to be really conscious of it, and make sure I use it as a tool to move forward and don’t get dependent on it. So I’ll take some days off so I don’t get a super high tolerance or anything like that.

It’s funny because I realized that I’m actually not that depressed anymore, and I’m not that anxious, just standing alone. I’m actually really motivated, I love what I do, etc. The anxiety and depression for me was sort of a reactionary emotion for me to this feeling that I couldn’t depend on myself, and fear of what would come up because of it. Like Im gonna fall of the wagon again, into old patterns, fuck something up at work, miss a deadline for school, etc, and the anxiety was coming from there. Like this feeling of like “holy shit I have all this responsibility and all these opportunities and I can’t trust myself NOT to trash this all because my stupid brain doesn’t work right.” I was constantly like overwhelmed, distracted, thinking a mile a minute, and not just calmly getting things done. That’s where the meds have helped me a lot. Lol i never thought of myself as someone with super severe ADHD symptoms, but I definitely had them, and once those are more maneagable and I know I can go through the day and stay steady, the anxiety and depression fell off because I didn’t have to worry about depending on myself anymore. 
Idk if that makes sense and it might be different for you, but that’s what I’ve noticed with it."

For me too, it also lasted too late since it started too late. Like in the morning I’d still be all groggy for forever, but then later at night I’d be too awake and and it would make it harder to have a good sleep schedule.

I was feeling super weird about that since a lot of other people were taking a lower dose, but this person who works in the medical field commented on my post and said it doesn’t work quite the same as something like alcohol, that’s just directly correlated to your body size. I don’t understand the biology well enough to explain it, but apparently it’s not that simple, so it’s totally possible for teeny people like us to need a slightly higher dose than someone like twice our weight. Her comment made me feel better because I was wondering the same thing. And the thing is even if I take a full 40, i don’t get ANY of the negative symptoms people talk about. I’ve seen people say they take like 5 and they’re getting all these weird physical things. I’ll take 40 throughout the day and I have never had a single physical symptom at all. So I think it works differently for everyone and you have to figure out the dose and regimen that works for you.

adderall,fhffhau,t1_fhcnbbe,1581542329.0,"For me it’s made a huge difference, and it was immediate as soon as I started taking it.

It’s been the difference between me doing my very best to make progress with my life and get things done, but missing details all the time that screw thinks up, and getting so constantly distracted by all the many things I need and want to do and that are happening that it was almost impossible to finish a single task. Lol I literally found myself in tears one day at work, because my boss was under the impression that I just didn’t care and wasn’t trying, and I was sitting there fighting how fast my brain spins and how hard it is to focus really trying to do my work. When I started taking adderall, it slowed that spinning down quite a bit, and gave me a noticeable level of calmness, focus, and ability to stay on track, and go through things one by one. Rather than this fast paced chaos, it’s like now like a very steady level. I feel calmer, more settled, I finish the things I start more easily, and it’s raised my self esteem a lot because of that. Now I’m still putting in a ton of effort into my life, but I don’t also have to fight against a brain that’s on the fritz."

I know addiction is a potential issue, so I’ve been trying to take days off like on weekends or vacations or other things like that. And I’ve asked my psychologist to help me monitor my use of it and behavior and stuff. I’m not super worried, just because of the mindset I’m in right now. Like I’ve struggled with some mental issues for a long time, and also spent plenty of time just like partying and experimenting with things and traveling and stuff. So I really have no desire to be getting high and dicking around right now hahaha. I just want to find a healthy and functional way to go to school and improve other parts of my life as well."
adderall,fhdh9l3,t1_fhdf8za,1581486282.0,"I'm taking the IR. They're the little orange 20 mg ones manufactured by Barr, that have a line down them so you can split them up into 10s. I'm pretty new to it. This is like my second week, and I'm the same way. It's not like the adderall takes away my personality or magically gives me discipline. I still have to make a conscious effort to do well in school, because i'm taking classes that really challenge me right now. It's not like a magic pill that makes it easy, it just helps reduce these super severe symptoms i was having that were making it impossible, even though I was like genuinely trying my best. Now I'm still putting in the effort, but its like I have a little edge that I didn't before, because i'm not like insanely hyperactive and thinking a billion miles a minute, and I can actually complete a whole task lol. 
When I started out, I just broke the pill in half and took 10. But I kept ending up taking another 10 like not that long after, because it just wasn't quite strong enough. Then I switched to just taking an entire 20 in the morning, with breakfast, and that's been a lot better. I was getting worried that I was taking ""too much"" or something, because i'm also a small girl, 5'1"". 
Usually after that, I'll take between 10 and 20 again later in the day, depending on how I feel, and what I need to do. Sometimes I won't take the second dose at all if it doesn't feel necessary. 
Starting with 20 in the morning and then doing 10 or 20 in the afternoon has seemed to be working great. I feel really normal. Like I just feel like me, but with less of a tendency to spin myself out trying to do 20,000 things at once and then get upset when i fail. lol. School has been going better and my confidence has gotten much higher because of it. 
I was worried, because I did start taking it pretty recently, and I was scared that the max i sometimes do of 40 was like ""too much"" or I was using it wrong or something. The thing is, I don't get this euphoria thing people keep talking about. I just feel pretty calm. I also don't get any physical symptoms, like at all. I've never had a single negative physical symptom, except I guess if I miss eating regular meals my stomach is a little more bothered and I feel a little edgier than i normally would. It's weird because I actually get HORRIBLE symptoms from things that ""normal"" people like and use all the time. Like caffeine will make me sweat and give me anxiety attacks hahaha. But adderall doesn't give me any of that, and so far it seems to be going great. I was just getting nervous because other people were describing way lower doses, and i'm a really small person. But if I take like 5 mg, it doesn't really do much of anything. Your reply makes me feel a lot better though haha thanks."
adderall,fhde41c,t1_fhck6bd,1581483647.0,"Gotcha. Yeah that didn't occur to me. lol I just started this medication, and like a week ago I was literally in tears, because I was trying to just read my music theory text book and I could not for the life of me focus on it enough to get anything done. And I'm really passionate about this! Now I've been studying like crazy. Maybe I'm just a nerd or just naaive but the last fucking thing on earth I would think to do with something that gives me a boost in being able to pursue my dreams is abuse it just to be high. lol there's tons of shit that makes you high, that's like a dime a dozen.

adderall,fhddvyn,t1_fhda1n6,1581483472.0,"That's so cool. It's sounds like you're really knowledgable and know what you're doing. Do you mind if I ask you another question since you work in the field? What would be considered like a ""low"" or ""high"" dose of adderal? I'm really new to this, and my psychiatrist prescribed me enough that I could take two, 20 mg pills per day, if necessary. But he also said to start out slowly, take less than that, and just see what was enough to mitigate my symptoms. Is there like a ""normal"" amount that most people take? I noticed that if I take 10 in the morning with breakfast, it does help, but 20 in the morning is definitely noticeably better. Sometimes I don't take the second dose depending on what I have to do that day. Usually if I do I take less than the first time. Would the full 40 mgs be considered a lot? I'm going to ask him some of this stuff too, and follow his advice when we have our follow up appointment, but your replies just really resonated with me so I wanted to hear your opinion too, since you have so much experience"
SexWorkers,fhdcb3j,t1_fhchjhd,1581482276.0,"Haha no worries for the unconnected thoughts. I see what you’re saying, but I just see it differently. Like for one thing, the beauty always has an onlooker, because I’m always looking over myself.  No matter where I go, or who else is around me, there I am with me. That’s sort of the point I’m trying to make. It is property I have a right too, because I’m me and my body is my own. Feeling beautiful and showing that in a way that improves my quality of life and feels authentic and empowering is different than being told I’m pretty and having people try to take something from me or use me in some way because of it. Lol and I guess no offense, but I just don’t agree with most of what you said and I think we just see the world in really different ways.

The closest thing would be I guess I sometimes feel a little edgy when it wears off, but honestly it usually makes my physical body feel better. Like just less tense, and more relaxed."

adderall,fhcgmbb,t1_fhcbxy3,1581462670.0,Ohhhh ok. I understand what you mean. That totally makes sense
adderall,fhcg95w,t1_fhcbbnx,1581462471.0,What do people even mean when they say abuse? I don’t really see how I could abuse something that’s like so medically helpful to me. Like just eat a ton at once or something? I’ve never understood what people mean by that
adderall,fhcb6i7,t1_fhc8qor,1581459886.0,"Wow even after 2 years? That’s great to hear and thanks for sharing. I’ve been SO much better off after starting up with this, and I started to get scared it was gonna be one of those things that like gets less effective if you get used to it or you have to start taking insane amounts of it or something. 

I was thinking about doing the take a break thing too! Do you feel like when you do that you feel like foggy headed or anything? Because I tried that this one weekend and felt kinda weird, but I was also SUPER sleep deprived so it totally could have been from that"
adderall,fhc6ljt,t3_f2dbyr,1581457242.0,Alcohol is going to make this worse. Try a really high oral dose of CBD. That helps me a lot.
SexWorkers,fhc30d5,t1_fhc09p1,1581455180.0,"That makes more sense. I’ve actually had trouble with some platforms shutting down accounts of mine that were purely personal and utterly vanilla and innocent. Lol like a Facebook I had in high school that was entirely just me and friends talking/complaining about homework or who had a crush on who, and then a bunch of those goofy group pics of like soccer teams and stuff. They removed that for “suspicious activity” and I still haven’t been able to get it back. Super super strange. Hahaha I mean I didn’t even know what marijuana looked like at the time I was such a little nerd in high school. I’ve never been able to get an answer from them as to why they shut it down, or been able to get it back."

SexWorkers,fhbz0ay,t1_fh7d6oi,1581452855.0,"That’s so true, and lately, I’ve been getting to a mindset where I’m questioning why there has to be so much emphasis on men liking my body. I’ve been told I’m super pretty my whole life, but that’s never been something I’ve enjoyed. It’s always been disempowering and something that’s worked against me. I’ve been sexually assaulted repeatedly, even by people I thought I could trust, and I’ve had people make sexual advances on me that were incredibly inappropriate based on the relationship we had and how I knew them. These men all seemed to have this attitude like this was all a compliment. Like it’s a GOOD thing that I’m pretty enough someone would rape me. Or I should be FLATTERED that I’m being sexually harassed in the work place because men like my body so much. And that made me think “why do you think that what I care about most is how you see my body?” I love my body and I feel good in it and Recently I’ve been taking back my rights over that. My looks are a part of me, and they should be beneficial to me. I want to feel beautiful because it makes me feel good, confident and empowered. I want to take nudes and because it’s like an art form. And of course it’s fun to sell them to men and receive all that income and positive feedback. Of course I love it that guys think I’m cute. But that isn’t the original point. My beauty doesn’t exist FOR their pleasure. It’s not some property they have a right to. It exists so I can express myself, thrive, and celebrate being who I choose to become."
SexWorkers,fhbxk7b,t1_fhbhte3,1581451991.0,"Hmmm ok. That’s interesting information to know, but it seems like they must not be checking accounts really at all. I know a ton of women who make their entire living selling photos on Patreon accounts that they have linked to their Instagram accounts. Theyre all very active of course as you have to be to maintain momentum with your customer bass. I’ve never seen anyone have any trouble with it at all which seems strange given the number of people I either follow or know who do this."
SexWorkers,fhbx1aa,t1_fh7xtr2,1581451675.0,"How would PayPal even know it was an account for a sex worker though? Also, if your customer wanted to use PayPal couldn’t you just let them know you have a policy that they have to pay through “friends and family” so they money isn’t held in escrow? I know plenty of people and businesses who do this, provided the money and services are being exchanged at the same time."
AskLegal,fhbwjc9,t3_f2b24h,1581451372.0,"What I would do initially, considering all that and before making a decision, is find a lawyer. Usually they’ll do cheap consultations or sometimes free. Explain the whole situation and have a copy of your lease with you if there’s one readily available to you. The lawyer will give you the low down on the situation because of their expertise. Then you’ll know how much it’ll cost to hire them, and what your chances of getting the landlord forced to cover the cost of are. The lawyer should be able to give you a pretty clear idea of if you have a good chance of winning the case, and the overall timeline and expense. 

After you do that you can make an informed decision about whether it’s worth it to move forward, or try to just pay for fixing it yourself. 

A lawyer consult is a good place to start though because then you’ll have more specifics, and generally it costs very little to get a consult with one. 

Haha stuff like this has happened to practically everyone I know so I’ve been around the block on this a few times."
AskLegal,fhbw20m,t3_f2b24h,1581451083.0,"If it clearly states in the lease he isn’t responsible  unless it’s whole building, then he’s off the hook unfortunately. Depending on whether or not the AC was in the unit when you moved in, or whether you installed it yourself, might change things. If you moved in and it was already working, you could make the argument that it was part of the apartment that you agreed to live in, and that you would have searched for a different one if there was  no AC. I don’t known what kind of person your landlord is but if he’s a reasonable and kind person having a conversation with him about it and framing that way while being polite might work. Sometimes they might be willing to pay partially for it or split it with you or something like that.If he’s not that type though, which I’m guessing he’s not since, most land lords are dicks, than you might be out of luck. You could take it to a lawyer and try to press the issue by saying the same thing I just did - it was a part of the situation you were signing too, and your agreement to the lease was conditional upon it. My guess is that probably wouldn’t go anywhere because of what’s actually in the lease you signed, and the question is, even if it worked out for you and he was forced to fix the unit, is it even worth it? It’s a lot of time and money and emotional energy to invest with this whole process. Legal fees aren’t cheap, and you’d have to spend a bunch of your free time rehashing the situation to legal people in your free time. I’d say your best bet if you can’t negotiate something with him would be to just eat the loss, pay for it to get fixed, and move on. 

Sorry for the super long response. I’ve had a few friends in similar situations so I hope this helps."
SexWorkers,fhbgrrn,t1_fhbfd4u,1581441976.0,Oh damn. I’m really sorry to hear that. I wasn’t aware they did that. I know a few people who use it to sell nudes as an extra on the side and I was thinking about doing that

SexWorkers,fh9w0kw,t1_fh9v06q,1581390904.0,"That’s a really good question. To be honest with you I’m between jobs right now too, and I went to this temp place that gets you like side work based on skills you have. I’ve baristad and worked in restaurants in the past, so this temp place has like tons of listings of events, and you go, serve or make drinks or whatever, and then get paid for your shift. And it’s cool because you get to pick what you want to do and sign up for gigs in an app. There’s a lot of places like that and I’m not sure what other skills you have, but you can get matched up based on those. I actually really feel where you’re at, because I just left my job too. I wasn’t in the same line of work, but like everyday I went in and I would wake up with this crushing weight on my chest and the rest of my life turned into me just being relieved I wasn’t there and then dreading going in. I stopped hanging out with friends and lost all my hobbies. Finally I quit, and like immediately my emotional health bounced back and I’m healthier and more “me” than I have been in months. The temp work helps, and then there’s other small gig things like that, like driving for Uber eats, picking up house sitting gigs off some apps that are for that, there’s a lot of ads online for like specific seasonal things that pay decently well. I know it doesn’t sound that glamorous, and at this job I was working I actually had like a title and was making more money than I had before. But it was crushing my life. I’ve been tiding myself over by combining different things like I was mentioning. Even though maybe it looks like I took a step down, I’m SO relieved everyday not to go back in. And it’s to given me the emotional energy to actually figure out what my next real career move is."
SexWorkers,fh9uvwj,t3_f1jh3f,1581390159.0,"Well I’ve never crammed before, but I definitely know the types of feelings you’re describing and it sounds like you might be burnt out.

SexWorkers,fh9ulqj,t3_f1lcg8,1581389971.0,"That’s so cool. Congratulations! I really want to do that!! I also perform and I’m in the process of crafting a stage/photo shoot identity for myself and deciding the direction I want to take it in. 

Were you ever afraid when you sold the photos of like “consequences” or whatever? I really want to do it, and I’m working up to it, but a lot of people are really negative and fearmongering about it like it’ll mess up your whole life or something. That totally seems crazy to me, and for me it actually feels really empowering to expose my body on my terms and be paid and appreciates for that. Did you get anyone trying to scare you out of it? And how did you feel about that? 

Also how did you sell them if you don’t mind me asking. I’ve been thinking of building up an Instagram profile and linking it to patreon. I partially want to do it that way, because like I said it’s also for me and feeling proud of my own body and I’d love to have a social media persona that I get to express that part of myself through. 

Sorry did the long comment but I’m really excited for you and also pretty new to this whole world."

piano,fh6txrs,t1_fh4uw9v,1581306011.0,"Oh ok!! Sorry you’re right I completely misunderstood you. 

So in that case, go to musictheory.net 

There’s a TON of exercises that will help you develop yourself more as a musician in general. 
There’s quizzes where they’ll play an interval and ask you to name it like “minor 7th” or “major 5th” or whatever. There’s also sight reading exercises, and different flash card-ish exercises for memorizing key signatures, naming notes in certain scales and modes and chords and such. I’m not sure what your focus is as a pianist, but there’s a ton of exercises and little quizzes and stuff like that. 

Obviously you can’t practice the physical movements and dexterity necessary to master piano without a keyboard, but having every key signature memorized just on sight, being able to easily identify what type of chord is being played just with your ear, all those skills will really contribute to your musical skills. If you practice them you’ll notice when you go back to playing piano that little bit of extra knowledge and focus you put towards it does make a difference. 

And if you’re one of the people who wants to dive really deep into music theory that’s a good website to get started on too."
darknet,fh6tc18,t1_fh6ta65,1581305578.0,Oh ok. I was doing it the vpn first way. Good to know. Thx
piano,fh4pn3a,t1_fh4irey,1581280970.0,Lol right?
piano,fh4pf7m,t3_f1dnnr,1581280895.0,"I mean I supposed you could get sheet music and just try to read it by ear. Without a piano it’ll be pretty hard to check if your pitches are correct unless you have perfect pitch which most people don’t. The best you could do I guess would just be to look at sheet music and clap out the rhythms. I have a sight reading sight singing class and they have us do that. The point is though your question is a little bit ridiculous. It’s like saying “how do I become a better ballerina by doing absolutely anything except practicing ballet.” A lot of piano has to do with muscle memory, familiarity of the feel of the chords and the movements between them. You could master music theory, in a theoretical sense and still be a terrible piano player. If I were you I would completely stop thinking about the question you asked, because if you want to be a pianist this simply will get you nowhere. Instead focus your efforts on how you can get your hands on a keyboard. I don’t know your situation, but taking into all the factors of your life, focus on that. If money is an issue look on eBay and Craigslist, post on forums like this. You’d be surprised what great deals and even just super kind people you’ll find. If it’s the fact that you don’t have a steady living situation, look around your city for places they might have accessible pianos, like community college practice rooms, you might be able to negotiate something with a small local music store where they let you play theirs, possibly for some exchanged service or small fee. Even spending 10 minutes a week ACTUALLY playing a piano will be more valuable than 2 hours a day of any silly finger strengthening exercises or other things like that. If you truly want to become better at piano, search your every option and find a way to play one."
