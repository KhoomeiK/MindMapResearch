But hey, I know critical thought isn‚Äôt for everyone."
todayilearned,fenvjld,t1_fen39xt,1579291558.0,"False. I never denied that.

But I suppose you are trying to make a comment with the intent to have the appearance of not being wrong in order to save face."
todayilearned,femj3qb,t1_fembiv7,1579258181.0,"Relatively. Sure the organic compounds that make up my body have a certain limit before breaking down, but the atomic mass has still originated from somewhere, considering that matter and energy is conserved. It‚Äôs literally why we consume food and drink and breath: to appropriate other mass for our own composition."
todayilearned,femiugh,t1_fem9nsw,1579257807.0,Lol except I‚Äôm not trying at all to look smart. It isn‚Äôt my fault that people aren‚Äôt willing to think a little more critically.
unpopularopinion,femirsz,t1_fem7ipp,1579257699.0,"Wrong.

Sex literally involves the body releasing chemicals of relationship bonding. The more sexual partners one has, the less powerful those bonding chemicals have. It‚Äôs why studies have shown that chances of divorce increases the more sexual partners one has.

Love also is not merely an emotion. You love a toy. You love a dog. You love a type of food. You love a movie. You love a friend. You love the way someone looks. You love a spouse. You love someone else‚Äôs spouse.... Love is ill-defined in general western first-world culture because it has just been reduced to a ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù. It‚Äôs conflated with the feeling of attraction and preference and types of stimulation and with many disposable and replaceable things."

Showerthoughts,felrui1,t1_felo90a,1579229386.0,Nope. Doing maintenance yourself still saves you money.
Showerthoughts,felo5ye,t1_felmfps,1579226860.0,Too bad. You‚Äôre still wrong lol
Showerthoughts,felm6ea,t3_ept4dm,1579225496.0,False. Doing your own maintenance is better than having a mechanic do it because you won‚Äôt have to pay for labor...
Showerthoughts,felm2g7,t1_felkhdw,1579225419.0,"If you do your own maintenance, you don‚Äôt have to pay for maintenance..."
todayilearned,fellxeb,t3_ept4hi,1579225320.0,False. It‚Äôs all the same age. All matter and energy is the same age.
depression,fellq49,t3_ept51n,1579225185.0,"Facebook sucks. You‚Äôre just seeing the best of what others are presenting to the public. It‚Äôs not the real them, just the persona. What you don‚Äôt often see are their monotonous times, their bad days, etc.

Facebook is just an acceptable way to stalk other people. Delete yours and don‚Äôt look back. It isn‚Äôt real."
