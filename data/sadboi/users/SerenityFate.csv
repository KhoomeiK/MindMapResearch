Healing is a very long and hard process. This isn't a set back but good movement forward. It's very difficult to admit to oneself that they need help mentally. The stigma around mental health is changing but it's a slow one. 

As for your MIL and SIL they sound just peachy. I hope you guys are able to get them out of your lives soon. 

One more thing, try to be gentle on yourself. All of that guilt isn't doing you any good. You and your family have been through and you are one tough cookie. You guys will get through this, especially with the support system you guys are building. All the internet hugs OP!"
