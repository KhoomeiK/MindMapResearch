But i find that if you have supportive family members and friends that you have confided in about this issue, they will be very supportive and help you whilst you drive (directions, helping to find a good parking location).  Then start doing very small trips to different places or familiar places.  I also suggest putting on some good music in the car too that you enjoy listening too, helps to calm the nerves."
