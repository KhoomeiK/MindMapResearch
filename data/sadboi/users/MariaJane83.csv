ptsd,fiz9m39,t1_fiyjdwz,1582857396.0,"You are a strong momma!!! 

My son is perfect - thank you so much for asking. We were so blessed that he was born strong and his lungs were good. We had some blood sugar issues and he didn‚Äôt know how to eat. It took some time but he eventually figured it out :) 

My labor with him was so not what I expected. My first was three hours from water breaking to birth (37 weeks), so I was worried it would go even faster with the second! It ended up being 36 hours from water breaking to birth. I actually went into active labor and no one could find the doctor. NICU had not visited once to talk us through what would happen. I had to push and I could hear the nurses freaking out because the doctor was no where. I had to yell for them to help me because they were just frozen in place. I started pushing, and as you know it doesn‚Äôt take too much when they are preemie. The doctor literally walked in and caught him. They got him to the incubator bed and the nurses were working on him when NICU finally showed up and they immediately took him. They never even let me see his face. Two hours later they hadn‚Äôt told me a single thing. I broke down and lost it - the most kind nurse looked me In the eyes and said I will find out. She returned a little while later with all his stats written on her hand and arm. God bless that woman. Another few hours and I was finally wheeled from delivery to NICU to see him for a few minutes and then was taken to recovery. 

There‚Äôs more of course, but all to just say your children, born of your own flesh or not, are a part of your beating heart."
ptsd,fixifbp,t3_fa5jul,1582820945.0,"My son didn‚Äôt battle as hard as your baby, yet I have it from his NIcU stay as well and general treatment during/after labor. I didn‚Äôt get to even touch him - they ran off with him (34 weeks premature) and left me for two hours not knowing anything but that it was a boy and he cried once. 

Good on you for talking to someone about it - survivors guilt is real. The trauma of being afraid to lose your baby is so very real. I recall hearing medical beeping on the TV a year after he was born and I completely melted down crying. It was a huge trigger bc that was the sound when he wasn‚Äôt breathing well or at all. 

Your love is deep and real and powerful - and so will the fear and trauma. You will find healing üíú"
