Read it all, I agree with everything you said.

selfharm,flb7ny0,t1_flaw2mi,1584999049.0,"Yeah, most definitely.
Especially when I get emotional about Tom (short for time of month; I just call him that and imagine as if he was a person because that alleviates some of the dysphoria). When Tom comes for a visit it's the worst (I made a rant post about it on the subreddit)
I was in denial for a long time. I didn't want to be different, I just wanted to be ""a normal girl"" (when I was trying to fit in).
I was very sensitive as a child, I would cry about everything, especially when a grown-up raised their voice at me. But then at one point I just kinda stopped crying so much.
Now, when I present myself as a guy, on one side I want to show the real me - (kinda) metalhead with crazy hair and accessories or (my polar opposite) fancy casual smart guy, but on the other side I just want to be the typical dude guy that's tough and wears simple typical dude clothing.

Sorry this was so long, I just really don't want to go sh so I'm doing everything I can to postpone it, but at the same time I really just want to cut bone deep.. :/"
selfharm,flape29,t3_fnofcx,1584988457.0,"Everyone who knows about it is telling me to stop. Saying that because I take antidepressants it will be better and that ""YoU kNoW yOu'Ll HaVe ThOsE sCaRs FoReVeR?!"" type of situation.
But I beat myself up for it the most. Because I am the one telling myself that boys don't cry, boys don't look like this, boys this, boys that. And there I am telling others that boys/men can do whatever they want with their mental health and emotions.

My mother doesn't get the fact that just because I transferred schools (now I am in home studying type situation) and am taking antidepressants doesn't mean it is sunshine and rainbows for me now. She doesn't get why I continue to cut and gets upset when I don't show her my arms.
I promised my gf I wouldn't sh bc it breaks her heart but I cannot."
