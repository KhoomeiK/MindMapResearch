I don’t think any old dummy off the street should be allowed to just hold you because they think you look like someone who did something wrong. These 2 deliberately ambushed him with guns out to detain him while he was on a jog. They killed this man because he had the audacity to fight back against 2 civilians trying to play cop. You’re right it wasn’t a citizen’s arrest it was murder. The fact they were getting away with it because they were friendly with someone in a position of power is an even bigger problem.

I started by listening to self help books. I know it seems corny but I concluded for myself that since my internal voice was so negative that I needed to listen to someone else read the book. Trying to heal yourself is work. It doesn’t happen overnight. Try to be patient with yourself and give yourself the same kindness you would show someone else in your situation. Find a therapist if you are able to.
