I’ve been misunderstood my whole life, I’ve gotten to the point of giving up. Everyday I struggle with getting up and pulling myself together, most days I can’t even get out of bed. I find that by not going out or doing anything with my life heightens my anxiety and depression. I know it’s easier to say “just do it” but it’s important to not even think about what you gotta do and let your body rule your mind. I promise you that you’re beautiful inside and out regardless of what you think, you are extremely capable of living a life you love. If no one ever understands you, that’s their problem not yours. Everyday try to love yourself because at the end of the day ourselves are the only thing that matters. Write yourself notes and place them on the mirror, get yourself to therapy. I love being open and honest to someone that won’t judge and has heard so many stories. And if you need anyone to talk to, please contact me. I don’t have to know you or meet you but I’ll be here for you, I understand you."

AmItheAsshole,f29bt9k,t3_dcess4,1570090622.0,"Girl, YTA. Growing up I had a similar situation with my parents, the chick my dad met was part of our church group and was going through her own divorce. As both couples are splitting, my dad and this chick start dating. My mom goes away for a few months to deal with the emotions, while also making my dad responsible for me over the summer. The church chick starts coming over a lot, I see her making moves on my dad while we watch movies. Over the course of the month I start noticing more and more their involvement with each other. I confront my dad about it but obviously he disagrees with my obvious observations. On top of it my dad has her come into my room to discuss the conversation we had, she had this whole speech about how much she loved her husband and would never disrespect my mom like that. I was eleven and this bitch thought she could be my mom but also negate her feelings for my dad. Fast forward a few months, once the divorces are finalized my dad and dumb bitch announce they’re together. OP no matter how naive you think your stepdaughter is- she’s not. She is paying close attention to your behavior, she can already psychologically break you down. You’re not being smart about this whatsoever, even if your husband has your back. You can never fight your stepdaughter for her fathers love, you both have different relationships- GET OVER IT. By trying to distance her from her father, you’re only fucking her childhood up. She’s gonna grow up resenting you, and you may not care now, but that is gonna be harder when she’s an adult able to argue with you on they same playing field. Think wisely of what you do, you might be fucking your life up with this move."
