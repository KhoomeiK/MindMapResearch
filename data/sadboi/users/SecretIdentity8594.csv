EDAnonymous,fmyw73g,t1_fmytm0m,1586497657.0,"24hrs-72hrs isn’t *really* “safe”, but it’s a lot less dangerous than longer fasts. I wouldn’t recommend fasting at all to be honest, but if you can definitely stick to 72hrs or less. If you start feeling sick, weak, dizzy or anything like that, **EAT**, no matter how far into your fast you are.

Fasting is always a bit risky as you aren’t feeding your body at all, which means no calories, no nutrients, less water (from food) than normal, and no vitamins, which really isn’t good for it, and doesn’t really help with weight loss as it messes with your metabolism. Intermittent fasting can help with weight loss and is less bad for you, but just eating a healthy, balanced diet with less calories than your TDEE but not going more than a couple of hundred calories below your BMR is the best method for weight loss.

Also, between fasts you should eat for a while. Like don’t do 48hrs and eat 1 meal and then do another 48hrs, that’s very dangerous."

Today kinda went better. I fasted again, while I baked the cake, which was really fun and went okay although I was weak and shaky and had to keep sitting down for breaks. The smell of the cake cooking made me horribly nauseous too. Eventually though I lost control and ate some of the excess mix, chocolate, and icing. Then when the cake was done I presented it to mum and my family and they all thought it was the best cake they’d ever tasted, including me. I even had a slice. I felt fat and greedy but the celebration took my mind off of it.

I had a small lunch, and then didn’t eat until dinner, so I got really cold and numb, plus a little dizzy again. But I ate, and that helped me feel a lot better. Then I tried to have some more cake and both mum and dad acted shocked at how big the slice I cut was, so I offered to put some back and they wouldn’t let me. So I went to eat it. And dad made oinking noises at me. Oinking noises. Like a pig. Like the fat pig I am. I’ve felt really bad about myself since then. I got into an argument as I didn’t want the cake anymore, and I went upstairs.

Sine the argument I’ve got painfully cold and numb again although I’m not dizzy unless I move. Mostly. I’m really scared of eating now though as dad’s made me feel really fat and disgusting and greedy and piggish. I’m even staying up late tonight so I can sleep through lunch tomorrow and fast for longer. I don’t want to eat at all tomorrow but I doubt I’ll be able to skip dinner.

selfharm,fl6vm4i,t1_fl6rnf9,1584884727.0,That’s how I feel about fasting and starving really badly. I feel pleasure and a numbing feeling. Generally not eating enough and feeling ill because of it is mostly part of my ED. But the fasting and starving I think is mostly self-harm although my ED definitely helps.
selfharm,fl6ina2,t1_fl6iicp,1584870638.0,I know I have an eating disorder. Do you agree that mine sounds self-harm based too then? I’ve noticed most others seem to focus somewhat around that too.

Even a day is hard so a week is amazing. 💖"
EDAnonymous,fl6ewl1,t3_fmc1gu,1584865713.0,"I’m sorry, honey. :(

You aren’t a failure, it’s just your ED making you do this. But try and eat it without purging tomorrow. I know you can do it. ❤️

Don’t let today take up too much of tomorrow, and do your best. It’s stressful, but I believe in you. \^\_^"
EDAnonymous,fl6et9d,t3_fmeuyl,1584865589.0,"You might not be able to go to rehab right now, but please try to be nicer to yourself during isolation. Eat a bit more, even if it’s just some more fruit and safe stuff, and try and eat your BMR if you can. It’s part of recovery, eating more, and you need to be at full strength to fight the virus if it infects you and starvation weakens your body."
EDAnonymous,fl6eo4i,t3_fmexxn,1584865400.0,"Yessss I get this so bad! I get it with everything, if I’m full I feel horrible and greedy and fat and disgusting while the stress of the pandemic is so much worse, but if I’m at least a bit hungry and tummy’s rumbling I feel a lot better about everything going on in the world and I feel so much more in control of my life. Even when I’m so hungry it hurts the disordered side of my mind still makes me feel better, although the circumstances of the world seem a lot more real and dangerous, however the sickness and the pain generally distract me from the stress of the virus."
EDAnonymous,fl59prb,t3_fly5q0,1584831700.0,"My sister is underweight too and it’s so triggering, I worry so much about her too. I think she has AFRID."
EDAnonymous,fl59k72,t3_fmikk7,1584831597.0,"Yeah... all the time. Often I’ll even get ingredients out to cook and I’ll start shaking with anxiety so bad that I’ll just package it back up and put it away, and just not eat."
EDAnonymous,fl59a4u,t1_fl4h84p,1584831416.0,"Things haven’t really gone any better... I did another fast of the same length and luckily didn’t get too ill, I played a game with my brother and then we watched anime for a bit as I was too dizzy to keep playing.

After my fast I had breakfast which felt too like too many calories, so I didn’t eat anything until dinner, which I ate half of. I’ve been a lot more ill today though... so cold and so dizzy. Even eating only gives me an hour of respite before the cold and sickness comes back now. Just recently I nearly fainted as I got into bed, and I felt so lightheaded for a bit, but now it’s less bad and I’m just a bit dizzy. The cold is horrible though...

I hate feeling like this. I don’t know why I feel this bad. I guess it’s the fasting... but I still feel like I shouldn’t be this sick and I should just ignore it. I feel like I just need to exercise harder than ever and power through it.

Tomorrow it’s mother’s day so I’ve got to bake a cake with dad and my sister midway through my fast and I’m so worried. If I don’t move much hopefully I won’t faint but I’m terrified I’m going to binge on the cake."

EDAnonymous,fl3ebdq,t1_fl3d57l,1584779924.0,Please at least try to drink water before doing something like that. Maybe bring some with you? It’s not safe to do it without food either but without water is really dangerous.
