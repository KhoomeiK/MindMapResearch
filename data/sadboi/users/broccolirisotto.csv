relationship_advice,fqfox2t,t3_ging7f,1589328872.0,"Hey! First I should note that you are very mature to be seeking help at this young age.
It takes a lot of self awareness and character to identify you have an issue and wanting to improve yourself - specially for selfless reasons.

Having such issues is completely understandable and common. We can’t control how our body makes us. You are a product of your up bringing, culture, body and etc.
There is a real issue that we don’t teach man to solve conflict without resourcing to violence. We rarely encourage man to speak about their feelings and articulate and channel their anger in a non violent way. So I’m gonna say you are a product of your environment.

What we can do is understand it’s wrong and seek help to prevent other people from getting hurt. 

I strongly advise you seek a therapist. Not only for the sake of your future partner but I think you are going to benefit tremendously from learning to channel your anger, frustration and etc in non violent ways.
If you can’t find a therapist I strongly advise you keep a journal where you can’t rite your feelings and articulate them in a honest open way.
Try to identify the source of your anger.
For exemple: let’s say you get mad at your parents because they tell you cannot go to a party.
Try to specify the nature of your frustration. Try to write what you can and can’t understand of their perspective too.
Try to meditation too.
Wish you all the luck!"
relationship_advice,fqfkcr1,t1_fqf9vuf,1589326457.0,"First : I’m a woman not a man. 

Second: I don’t mean average in a scientific “look it up” kind of way.

If you “look it up” average standards will change depending on what is your social cycle. If you are in a big city going out with people who are sexually liberated the average number is going to be higher than if you are in a small conservative city where most people marry their highschool sweethearts.

What is the overall average in the world or in the us I couldn’t care less.

What I mean is that one sexual partner per month isn’t an abnormality. Many people consider this very normal standard behavior. Depending on which social cycle you belong this is a common thing: having sex with one person per month.

From a psychological standpoint is also a normal average behavior. Meaning - no psychiatrist would be worried that this is abnormal concerning behavior. So there is objectively nothing wrong with that. For many social cycles this is an average thing indeed.

Over a period of time I can say I had one sexual partner per month. Maybe 5 or 7 months on a row. But I’ve also abstained from sex for over a year too. It depends on what phase I’m going through. I don’t have an unhealthy relationship with sex. I have friends who have sex with multiple partners per week and when it’s a man nobody questions this behavior."

But perhaps he is not joking and trying to see your reaction. It that’s the case being mad doesn’t serve this relationship. You need to have some open channel of communication where you encourage him to talk about his feelings and where you talk about your feelings too.
Hiding feelings won’t make them go away. Talking about them might at least sort some stuff out.
You guys need to have an honest conversation about this relationship. If he is missing romance and new flings he needs to communicate this to you in a mature way. If you have certain boundaries this needs to be communicated in a mature clear way.

Him making fake jokes and you being mad isn’t the proper way to communicate about what is going on. This is further complicating the issues you already have."

Hang on in there - by the time you go to college things will improve. Try to find a social circle that is more open and prone to critical thinking. Try finding role models and philosophers who talk about gender stereotypes. Empower yourself with knowledge and find the right tools to support your self confidence.
Try to find people that enjoy the same hobbies as you and don’t feel like you should be hanging with people that you don’t click with.

relationship_advice,fpt4g2h,t1_fpt0v19,1588884690.0,"Yes that’s exactly what I said - I think lack of monogamy can throw off the balance of a relationship. Our relationship is great and I don’t plan to be with anyone else. I just have an open channel of communication and I’m open to discuss anything at any given time. 

I know a lot of couples who have open relationships and it works great. 
I also know a lot of couples who open the relationship and it created lots of issues.

We have been together for a while and nothing ever happened and I don’t think it ever will.
If something minor happens I will be hurt and etc but I honestly just think this person is my soul mate and I won’t let a mistake ruin my relationship. It doesn’t make sense to me - to throw away something truly great and profound. 
We have been best friends for over 7years and dating for 2yrs so I feel very secure in the relationship. I think that’s why I’m comfortable with some minor incident - maybe if it was another boyfriend I would be less ok. And certainly if this happened in the beginning It would be a dealbreaker. So that’s why I think things can evolve over time and we might change perspectives."

Put yourself in her shoes. 
He is the kind of guy who pretends he likes the mother of his children and pretends he is selfless dating her because that’s the “right thing to do” but he is also chasing other woman behind her back.

relationship_advice,fpt0arw,t1_fpsvzj4,1588882649.0,"Maybe I expressed myself badly. I’m not saying I will want to open the relationship. Im not with him today hoping we will open the relationship in 20 years time. I’m saying things can change and it’s impossible to discuss today what will happen in 20 years time. And that when things change it’s important to create room for open dialogue and honesty.

Like I said. We are very open to discuss everything and nothing is off the cards or a taboo topic. That doesn’t mean that ultimately this will be a decision we both are going to reach (opening the relationship).

Right now we are both very monogamous. This is very off the cars for me. And I honestly can’t imagine opening the relationship and neither can he - but the point is that I understand he might have different needs and wants 20 years from now and maybe so will I. Something that is unimaginable today can be a possibility in 20 years. I’m willing to adapt and discuss openly in case this is necessary and he feels the same way.

Our relationship isn’t open but we also already discussed that in case something happens and we have a lapse of judgment as long as is something minor (one night stand while drunk for ex) we are both willing to forgive if the other person is honest about what happened. Our relationship is bigger than a lapse of judgment and bigger than monogamy. I think all relationships should be based on more than monogamy. Although I understand lack of monogamy can throw off the balance of a healthy relationship creating difficult issues - that’s why I don’t want to open it. I can’t handle it and neither can he. But I can’t say about the future."

relationship_advice,fpsjckx,t3_gfad26,1588874443.0,"Ok - I have a very similar dynamic. I also became an orphan at very young age. Although i don’t have siblings nor kids. I’ve traveled the world alone and dated many different people. I have very fixed and ambitious goals too but in my case my bf is my rock and he really provides me the emotional support I need to accomplish things. I’m also very serious about planning - so I get your concern about wanting to be sure he is in this for real. I have the exact same concern. I guess that’s because we are used to be alone and do things alone and when we can count on someone that’s a big deal and we get afraid cos you know how hard it is to loose someone so close.

My boyfriend is a couple years older than me but he is concerned with things that I already accomplished (earning a living). His parents currently support him and we live together. But he never experienced certain things and has lived a very sheltered life. He often feels a little overpowered in our relationship but we are very aware of that and we try to process those differences in a way that is constructive.
In the beginning of the relationship he too was very worried about not having space to grow but that has not been the case so far. I actively encourage him to challenge himself.

We are best friends too and like you we have great communication. This is the best relationship I’ve ever been in. I’ve had relationships before and I never believed in soulmates and all that crap but I can say I do believe in it right now. That’s how I know we are in it for the long run.

It took us 6 years to be together. Being with him always crossed my mind. But it took me dating people and valuing the wrong thing s in other relationships to fully be able to value this relationship I have now. when it finally happened it was 100% the right time. 
So I get that sometimes we need to live a little to be our best selves in the relationship. But you guys are already together so that complicates  things.

Anyway

I’m over qualified to judge your situation but I’m also a little bias.


I believe you guys can make this work as long as you are able to provide the freedom the other person needs.
She seems to be doing so and maybe he needs to trust that he will have space to grow. On the other hand maybe he wants other relationship experiences and if that’s the case he needs to be honest about it.

Another advice would be:
Don’t make judgements about your dynamic based on living together during the quarantine.
I’m gonna say that living together during the quarentine is really hard. Me and my bf have to remind ourselves that this is a temporary thing and that things were great before the quarantine. Luckily we were living together before - so we have a baseline and we know the issue isn’t us living together per say but the whole pandemic thing.

Again although I 100% get and share her concern
I should say that the death of parents and the pandemic should be a reminder that we can’t plan our lives to every inch of it and live a risk free life. Things can change completely overnight. Although I trust my boyfriend is in this for the long run I’m often afraid he will die out of the blue for ex. Or kill himself. So the things we plan might not work out exactly how we expect - to accomplish things we need to leave room for unexpected things otherwise we don’t live.

Face this relationship with serenity - you can still have experiences and autonomy while inside a relationship. This is - if the partner is open to let this happen."
relationship_advice,fps8fbp,t3_gf8uak,1588869208.0,"Ok so he lied (or was being deliberately ambiguous) about being separated. Not cool. 

Now he is “with her” to give support. What does it mean to be “with her”? He is having sex with her to give her emotional support? Or is he friendly and part of her life? I don’t get what is their relationship.

She knows about you and this is a good sign. It means he is honest with her and not cheating on her.

My opinion is that she is the most important person in his life right now and someone who he deeply respects. Probably a dead bed situation. It’s gonna be hard to be with someone who has such a strong relationship with someone else.

I would say go meet her and try to be open. Listen what she has to say. Be honest about what you can and can’t handle."
relationship_advice,fps16zi,t1_fprq9o4,1588865753.0,"Because sex isn’t always about love. Sex is about desire and often about impulse and about many other things. Some people have a hard time controlling their own desires. Some people also have a hard time managing their love in a healthy way. Love isn’t a magic thing that makes everything work out. People mess up in all sorts of ways. You can also argue that you don’t scream at someone you love because that would be hurtful and you shouldn’t hurt the person you love. But those kinds of things happen because people aren’t perfect 100% of the time.
And sure people who love each other SHOULD be honest. But people are often afraid to be honest. Afraid of loosing the person they love if they tell the truth. And many people are indeed honest and tell their partner when they cheat.
Also cheating is an umbrella term for many kids of behaviors. There are more severe forms of cheating and more mild ones.
You are making things too black and white."
relationship_advice,fprs7ya,t3_gf6gv2,1588861020.0,"I’ve sort of cheated twice. I was also cheated on.

I think you can love someone and cheat. But more often then not the cheating is a sign of lack of respect and communication rather than a sign of lack of love. Similarly fidelity isn’t a sign of love.
Also - cheating is an umbrella therm for lots of different behaviors. Some indicate lack of love and some indicate other things. 
But to be honest I think lack of communication and respect are very bad for a relationship. We see many couples who love each other but can’t get along because they can’t properly communicate or because there isn’t respect. So the love eventually fades away because the relationship isn’t working.

Now to my experiences with cheating.

- Case one - Why my ex boyfriend cheated on me multiple times: He was insecure and afraid of being vulnerable in a relationship. Why I know that? Because I proposed an open relationship and he refused. Meaning he wanted to keep a part of his life “secret” - hidden from me. He is 38 and he cheated every girlfriend he ever had. This was a part of who he was. Maybe he never “truly” loved anyone? Well. Maybe? Who am I to judge what “true love”. I couldn’t handle the instability of having a partner with a secret life. He was a narcissist and had many many issues so we broke up.

- Case two: I cheated on this boyfriend (previously mentioned) who cheated on me. Why you ask - was it lack of love? No it was not. I cheated because I loved him too much and wanted a way out of the relationship. You can argue I cheated because the relationship was not making me happy and fulfilled.

- Case three: I cheated on someone I wasn’t in a formal relationship with. Meaning he never asked me to be his girlfriend and he was moving away from the country. It was a grey area. I did something wrong and I justified my actions on technicalities. In this case I did love him - but I didn’t love him very much. I just had a steady relationship of 4months and let myself get involved because I knew he was going away. In my mind he didn’t provide what I was looking for in a partner and I met someone who did. So I cheated him with someone who I thought was more close to what I was looking for.

Now let’s exam this “what I was looking for”. In different times of life we “look for” different things because we usually look for what is lacking  in ourselves (which is a big mistake). With time we learn to look for the “right things” and hopefully we find a deeper relationship. But we still have this habit of relying on our romantic relationships to improve things for us.    

The classic exemple is the middle aged guy who starts dating a 20 something girl to feel young again but he probably loves his wife more. The relationship with his wife is deeper in some senses. Or maybe he just started dating his wife because at the time she was solving other superficial issues he had. But right now his main problem is that he can’t bare feeling old so he starts dating a younger girl so he doesn’t feel irrelevant. His wife can’t possibly provide him the same feeling he is looking for in a 20 year old. Nobody can provide everything. Arguably a guy should get a therapist and not an affair - but people often aren’t aware of what is happening and simply get carried away by emotions. They don’t see that the affair is clearly about something else. He could also have communicated his needs to his wife and find a way to make this work respectfully but there are lots of taboos and people are afraid to talk about certain things.

Another exemple. A girl feels powerless because she is told she is less than a man. People don’t take her seriously and don’t give her attention. So some successful guy wants to date her and she might replace her boyfriend for someone who validates her and who makes her feel “special” because she doesn’t feel she can be special by herself.

There is a reason those things happen so often. This isn’t about the individuals involved but about certain structures. This is because being in a good relationship is also about being happy with yourself and satisfied - because if the other person feels insecure or sad this person might look for this satisfaction outside the relationship as a easy way to fix bad emotions and compensate bad feelings.

Now I personally think I’ve found my “soulmate”. Honestly - the love of my life. I don’t stop 100% being attracted to other people but I have huge respect for our relationship and I’m terribly afraid of throwing out the balance and doing something that might hurt him. For now it’s no big deal. I can easily not cheat. 
But maybe 10 years from now or 20 years from now I’m going to miss certain emotions only a fling can give me. Not because I don’t love him but because I maybe will miss the feeling of having a crush or having a one night stand. I think it’s possible to love someone very much and miss the experience of having a one night stand. A one night stand is very insignificant if compared to a 20 year relationship or even compared to the relationship we have right now.
I hope it doesn’t happen and that I never feel the need to have a one night stand but I can’t possibly know. But if that happens I’m going to talk to him (my bf) and see if we can make this happen in a way that isn’t cheating and maybe open the relationship a little. 

But that’s because we have a very open channel of communication. I can see that maybe a couple that has lots of taboos in their relationship can’t properly communicate what are their needs outside the relationship and this leads to cheating and lying.  But I think this hurts the relationship really bad - the lying - more so than sleeping with another person per say. Get what I mean?"
relationship_advice,fprl6e3,t3_gf5bub,1588856802.0,"Sounds like she is depressed. She could only get some happiness from this very abstract stranger that was completely foreign to her life. She can’t see herself happy in her own life that’s why she can’t seek excitement in you. She can only find excitement in something that is completely far away and foreign. The excitement is the possibility of running away from her life. This is what this stranger represented.

You have a job, not only a job but a career. You have coworkers, possibly friends. A life outside this relationship. Seems like she doesn’t have a job, education, friends, goals or any life outside this relationship. And honestly the relationship isn’t going that great and she is unhappy. That’s why is hard for her to be honest and communicate the lack of desire - because that’s basically the only relationship she has in life and she is failing and it’s “her fault”. This leads to her giving excuses and never properly solving the underlying issue.

Her self-steem is probably really bad. Us females often think that our only worth is being attractive and finding a man (this is very ingrained in our brains although it’s obviously not true). We also learn from the world that we haven’t agency over our lives and we need a man to “save us”. I can guarantee 99% of my friends born before the 2000’s have been brainwashed with this idea. Obviously we grow out of this and we fight this idea. But many never do.
Bottom line - The only thing she has is the last years of her youth and the possibility of finding a man that will “change her life”. She can’t see that she can change her life for herself. She doesn’t feel empowered. So she can’t see how her life can be improved and how this relationship can be improved.

At the same time I ask myself what are you getting from this relationship? She doesn’t show love. She is unhappy with you. Why do you want this to last any longer?
I don’t even think you love her. I think you get much of your satisfaction from sources outside this marriage and the marriage provides a few things that you are attached to.
You are probably attached and afraid of change and being alone. 
Seems like you are trying but I think you don’t know exactly what to do. So you have some good ideas on how to help but no consistent method. You are also emotionally affected by how the relationship is going so you can’t stick to a plan to improve it because your emotions make you act in a way that is damaging- which is completely understandable. She obviously isn’t helping which makes things very hard on your end.

I strongly empathize with both you and your wife. Seems like you both are struggling and that you are afraid of communicating honestly. You both (but specially her) also don’t have a lot of self knowledge - so it’s hard to communicate what she feels and why she feels what she feels because she doesn’t fully understand. She probably can’t talk to anyone to figure this - and although she could talk to you try to try figuring things out she is afraid of being honest. Exemple: She is afraid to explain why she isn’t attracted to you and actually explore the depths of it.

You have two options here. 

You can give it a try and actively help her get back at her feet. Bare in mind this is going to be 98% you (which it isn’t fair but maybe it is “what it takes”). Get into couples therapy. Have deep conversations about what you feel and what her feels without any judgment and resentment. Have deep conversations about how her. Actively - and I mean everyday - encourage her to find the things that make her happy and remember her everyday to do them. Help her find goals and stick to them. And then MAYBE the relationship can start working again. When she is happy with herself again.

Or you can end this relationship and I wouldn’t blame you. You are both fairly young and you have the chance to change your lives find new partners and etc."

I forgot to address something - most time people hit someone there isn’t any visible sign of the aggression. It takes some serious beating to start seeing bruises. Like - try slapping your own leg very strongly - it won’t leave a mark. So the fact that you can’t see any bruising doesn’t mean anything. So don’t question your memory because you can’t see a bruise."
relationship_advice,fpq2gdj,t1_fppzhkj,1588813836.0,"There you go. You have your answer. When he is drunk he gets aggressive to the point he threw a glass he was drinking from. That’s a pattern of behavior. He acts out of character and looses control for silly and minor reasons (like you not understanding what he is saying). It isn’t crazy that he would hit you. It’s coherent.

Second point. People who lie tend to get aggressive when confronted with their lies. My ex boyfriend who was lying to me he would get very angry when I would bring up some incoherences in what he was saying. He would get very pissed and impatient. At the time I thought this is a sign of him being truthful. I couldn’t believe someone could have the guts to get mad at someone who doesn’t believe a lie they are telling. But later I found out it’s a quite common reaction amongst liars.

Think about it. Put yourself in his shoes.
Imagine you didn’t hit your boyfriend and tomorrow he wakes up and start saying your hit him.
How would you react?
Would you be angry? I doubt it. I think you would be a little concerned about his mental health that he is suddenly making up a memory in his head. Or a little frustrated and confused. Perhaps you would even question your own memory - maybe you did hit him and you blacked out the memory. But I don’t think you would be angry and irritated.

Please don’t go down that path of doubting your own sanity. It’s dark and awful to be in that position. On top of that your boyfriend did something really scary and he clearly can’t control himself when he drinks. Please take care. ❤️"

It’s weird. I think it’s much more likely that he is lying because this is a very common manipulation technique.

If your bf apologized and understood what he did wrong there is no reason to stand your ground but you can feel sad and want to process this feeling. How i deal with this:
I usually communicate to my bf that I need more than one apology after something like that happens. I resent him for creating a situation and making me feel down. I rationally forgive him but I ask him to cheer me up and be extra loving when something like that happens. This is maybe something you can try too. Try to communicate how you feel. “Look i know that you apologize when you scream at me but i still feel bruised even after the apology because of what happened. I can’t help it. Can you be a little extra caring and cheer me up when something like this happens?.” 

Another thing. If you are fighting over something  reoccurring then you guys will benefit from having a longer conversation and not end the issue with an apology. Meaning - if he screams with you and you spot this is part of a reoccurring thing you should have a conversation about this and stand your ground a little more because people can’t keep having the same wrong behavior over and over again and just apologize.

It’s quite the opposite - people with money can afford to be lazy and people without money can’t afford being lazy. Also there are plenty of medical conditions that make people “”lazy”” or less driven like depression and those people can only have food in their plates if they come from rich families who can give them proper care otherwise they are basically left on the streets.

On top of that - People who are born with less money are more likely to experience things that will affect them on the long run and develop psychiatric issues and traumas. A father that died because they live in a dangerous neighborhood, a mother that died because they couldn’t afford her healthcare, sexual abuse because parents had to leave the kid with some neighbor to go to work and couldn’t afford hiring a trustworthy nanny etc. BUT they will have a lot less support to deal with this through life because they can’t afford to have traumas. 

In a rich family you can be protected. Moms can pay for a nanny that speaks 3 languages and has a PHD and don’t need to rely on the neighbors. Of course things can fail and rich people can have hard experiences too. But then if something goes wrong (death, abuse, trauma) the parents can buy expensive psychiatric help to help their kids to heal and not be depressed. But even if all the psychiatric help doesn’t work they can live from inheritance from their entires lives.

relationship_advice,fplfak0,t3_ge5icz,1588711676.0,"Dating my best friend right now. I met him when I was 21.
In my case it took us 6yrs to finally go out. No joke. I also had this on the back of my mind (dating him) but I was too afraid of hurting him because I was too adventurous. I knew I wouldn’t be able to sustain this relationship from the age 21 onwards without living other shit.

Waiting was really good. I almost lost him to another person - that’s always a risk. But I made sure we were both ready for a veeeeery long therm relationship when we finally got together.

This is my personal experience but there are many other possible narratives and outcomes. Maybe other people will have completely opposite experiences. It’s honestly impossible to predicts. 

Word of advice: Be realistic about the possible outcomes. Be realistic about what you want and what he wants. Be realistic what to expect- the good and the bad.

If he isn’t ready he might not want to commit. Or maybe he will commit and won’t be able to sustain his commitment for very long. He might also surprise himself and be able to maintain this relationship. If the relationship ends you guys might be able to still be friends but maybe you won’t.

Now be realistic about what you can give. Be realistic about what you care the most and what you want. How hard it would be to lose this friend? How hard it would be to not be intimate right now? Can you handle seeing him with another girl? Can you handle being friends?

I’d say go with the flow if you are unsure if you want to pursue this. If you are sure this is a good idea then let him know."
relationship_advice,fplcv0a,t3_ge4r6o,1588710441.0,"- Why being intimate with someone makes me worry so much?


We all have our narcissism which is basically the idea that we have of ourselves. Which is what sustains us mentally. We have a good self-esteem when the image we have of ourselves is being returned by the world accordingly to what we expect/want/project.

In a loving relationship, we delegate to our partner much of the responsibility to give the feedback on our self-image. It’s someone that knows you intimately so this person becomes some sort of witness that can testify for you who you are with a lot of credibility.

If someone you don't know likes someone else more than you, you may not care so much, but if a partner, someone who knows you very well, likes someone else more than you, that's a very strong blow to your Narcissus. Like an eclipse - there is this third object, namely the moon (person causing the jealousy) blocking the sunlight (your self image being projected back to you by your boyfriend) from reaching the earth (you). 

In this case it seems that you are not a jealous person (that was only to illustrate) but you seem to be worried about giving too much power to your partner and risking relying too much on one person for you to shape your perception of yourself. 

I’m gonna guess here:

A) You either already have a very strong self image and don’t trust that he will be able to “get you” and value and notice the things you like about yourself accurately. 

B) Or you are too insecure and afraid he will project something that you don’t want to see. That he will make visible things you are insecure about. 

I’m gonna guess A because you seem like a person who knows your value and it’s a bit scared of guys being too superficial and going for boobs instead of brains. Or maybe a bit of both.

Does that make sense?"

relationship_advice,fpky6x6,t3_ge2tb8,1588703086.0,"I’m gonna say something that might be controversial. Us girls have a lot of pressure to stay pretty.

I had this discussion with my best friend and he doesn’t care he is balding and I straight up told him he isn’t allowed to bald. That he will need to take some medication because I don’t want his girlfriend to have a bald boyfriend. That he doesn’t get to benefit from male privilege.

I was kind of joking but I was also not joking.

Once his hair is gone the hair will never grow back. 
I think it’s 100% ok to suggest your boyfriend take some oral and topical medication. And no it doesn’t cause impotence. It’s a counterfeit for 9% of people who take it and it isn’t permanent. So if he experiences impotence this will resume as soon as he stops the medication.

She was also mature and realized she needed to break things off because she couldn’t honor her commitment. Maybe she could have realized it sooner but as soon as she realized it she made the honorable decision.

Now I ask - why do you want her to regret if you don’t even want to take her back? What’s the point here? You want her to suffer?
Seems like you want some sort of revenge. Try to stay away of this kind of feelings. What happened is very natural - you guys are starting a new era in your lives and things are going to change a lot. Growing apart is the natural thing to happen.
What she wants as a 18 year old woman is very different from what she wanted as a 15 year old girl or what she will want as 25, 35, 45 year old woman. Our priorities change overtime.

I don’t doubt you love her and that you tried your best for this relationship to work. But I can spot some issues with your reasoning and how you dealt with the relationship. 
Relationships aren’t only about loving the other person. Relationships are about growing together, learning to communicate, having a common path and learning to understand what your partner needs and wants. It’s really complex actually.
It takes time and tryor and error to learn those things and that’s why most people don’t go on to marry their highschool sweethearts.

I’m going to say right off the bath two things that you did wrong here:
You come off as a little controlling and not open. You told her not to go to a party because there are people there using drugs. You are an adult now and 99% of parties will be attended by people who will be doing drugs. There is nothing wrong with that and that doesn’t mean you or your ex need to do drugs. People who do drugs aren’t all bad and evil. Parties with people who do drugs aren’t bad and evil. They are just different from what you are probably used to. You were very closed and judgmental of her decision to go to this party. It’s clear that she wants to meet new people and learn about different things - go out of her bubble. Seems like a noble thing to want.
That’s how we learn about the world and from others.

Now - I don’t think that the issue was the drugs only- I think you were intimidated by the party and already afraid of her cheating or being seduced by “another world”. Rightly so because she did cheat - but that is besides the point. The point is: you can’t stop someone from having experiences. You should have been honest about your insecurities and you guys should have had a conversation about this. About the best way to deal with her wishes and how this could have been accomplished without breaking up. 
Of course sometimes this isn’t possible. Some times people have different views for their own life that can’t be negotiated in a relationship. Sometimes people actually want to date other people and you either open the relationship or you break up.

I think you both have a lot to learn and you should loose the attitude of thinking she owns you something because you were a caring boyfriend.

If she wasn’t caring towards you that’s bad and maybe you are just better off.

Will she regret her decision? I’m gonna say probably not. 
She is looking for novelty and adventure and you can’t seem to provide this for her. In a few years she will probably want something different.
Will she ever want you? I don’t know. Maybe. Who knows. It will depend a lot on where life leads her.
I know that’s not what you wanna hear.

I would not trade the experiences I had as a young adult (the good and the bad) for a relationship. I don’t personally know people that would.
Getting to know new people and discovering more about yourself through relationships is a very enriching thing for most people. Specially if you decide to do so - I mean - there is a reason she made this decision she probably knows herself to some extent."

You aren’t complaining about him asking for the keys - you both are well aware of the situation and he is asking for the key as a punishment as a passive aggressive gesture. Is less about the key and more about the passive aggressiveness.

I had a boyfriend who was very similar. Same situation. I had a house to store my stuff. He would make me pack my things and stay at my place when he was traveling. I couldn’t leave a toothbrush there. 

My advice: Talk to him again and try to better articulate your point. Contextualize - explain you are bringing it up again because you are now living with him and this is bugging you.

There was an agenda behind the convictions. There was clearly an agenda behind the impeachment.

If a group of 10 people commit a crime and just 4 are persecuted and the other 6 are off the hook you can’t say justice was done. This is not to defend the 4 people that were convicted - the 4 people should still go to jail - but question the moral standards of the judge who let 6 people off the hook.

I think the point here is not to defend PT. But to say the persecution and the narrative of corruption highlighted in the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff was not an narrative highlighted to “bring justice to the people”. 

The impeachment was a power coup essentially and it was articulated by people who wanted power not justice. That’s the real issue here. Of course there was corruption - no question about it. Should PT go back to the government? Hell no.
But the people who “brought justice” were as corrupt as PT was and had ulterior motives to do what they did.  

The impeachment happened a year after Dilma was reelected and nothing major happened to lead to her impeachment. The corruption was as well known as ever and she got elected anyway. Nothing new was suddenly discovered after her election. Just the “pedaladas fiscais” but nobody care for those.

At first people where going to the streets to protest for the increase of the public transport fees and inequality in the country. I was there in all the protests.

There is no way of knowing. I understand your frustration but we can’t change the past - we can only work on the future. I can’t go back into being a kid and we can’t do it all over again but we can improve our relationship with me in the present as an adult. 

I’m 21 and I’m probably moving out of the house soon so I think this is the time for us to built some mutual trust and a relationship where you can give me counseling and where we can have a healthy communication - not a relationship based in control because the control is going to me frivolous once I get out of the house. You won’t be able to control strictly my internet habits once I’m out of the house so you need to trust I’m someone who can live a life independently because this is happening soon. You need to trust the morals and values you raised me with. I think what we can do now is to build this relationship.
If you want to continue monitoring my internet habits for now that’s ok. But we need a better plan for the long run. Don’t you think? I want to be transparent with you and I want you to be transparent with me.”"

You are not dealing with this situation in the best possible way. I think you should tell her exactly what you are telling me here: “I think I’m testing your limits and I’m being self destructive. I’m sorry.”.

relationship_advice,fp77v2k,t3_gboyjh,1588365641.0,"He is very young. Like way too young. This is probably his first real relationship and he is very likely replicating macho behaviors that he sees around.

On top of that you guys barely know each other. Barely. The relationship isn’t going great and he is insecure.

Sure he is being controlling and unreasonable. But let’s go a bit further. 
His managing crisis skills are really awful. If you guys stay together It’s likely that you will be raising two children at once: him and the baby.

All his behavior is basically him overcompensating for his insecurity in the worst ways possible. He has no idea how to deal with his emotions and how to work with them. He is basically afraid and reacting like a jerk because he can’t deal with being afraid.

1. Afraid you will leave him - so he threatens to take all your stuff and sue for custody so you will change your mind. 

2. Afraid you like your friends more than you like him - so he complains about your friendships trying to end them so he will become the most special person in your life. 

3. Afraid you will cheat - so he monitors your phone so you won’t get the chance to do so. 

4. Afraid you don’t rely on him for decision making and feeling unimportant because you don’t wanna do what he suggested - so he threatens you to never help again to see if you really need him and if you would care if he is no longer around.

Instead of dealing with his own fear he tries to intimidate you so he can control the situations and “win” by being terrible to you with no regards for your emotions, no generosity, no empathy, no care. This shows me that he is very selfish too.

Anyway - terrible behavior. He is trying to be more secure and gain back control basically by intimidating you and cornering you.
He doesn’t know how to deal with his emotions and acts like a spoiled brat. This is obviously going to affect you and honestly you need to understand if you can and want to educate this person."

If she send you nudes it’s a little obvious that this is a flirty conversation and that she is into you. She might be dealing with conflicting emotions. On one hand she likes you and she has some attraction but on the other hand something that you are doing is making her not want to be with you - questioning if this should be just a friendship or if you guys aren’t even supposed to be friends. She is having a hard time cutting you out of her life because she likes you (either as a friend or as something else) but you are honestly testing her limits.
Just because someone likes you it doesn’t mean she will life you forever and put up with everything. I think she is having an internal debate about how she feels and how to proceed.

If you like this girl - and I’m assuming you do since you came here to talk about her - I would focus less on what her feelings are and more in improving the relationship so her feelings can have space to grow."

I usually think it’s irresponsible to claim this so bluntly on reddit but I’ll make an exception: he is cheating - no doubt about it. 
I honestly think it’s possible to have a relationship with someone after the other cheated but I don’t think it’s possible to have a relationship with someone who is gaslighting you. Honestly. Down the line this takes a turn on your mental health.

You shouldn’t be constantly worried in a relationship. You shouldn’t feel secure. Often we feel insecure in a relationship because the other person isn’t making us secure. Often we feel insecure in a relationship because of our own traumas and insecurities.
Try to figure out if this is your own personal issue or if this is a relationship issues where you guys should be working together. 

It seems to me that you are very invested in the relationship. It sounds that you are incredibly attentive and thoughtful. These are all great characteristics.

But my way to cope with it was to do things normally and focus on things that brought me joy. I didn’t want to be at home all day thinking about this. 
It was hard because it was my first week in college and I didn’t knew a lot of people and I couldn’t just tell people I’ve just met about what happened. So I went to class and I was talking to people while hiding this “secret”. Obviously it felt weird doing stuff while not 100% present - but it helped me get through this difficult time.

Nobody tells you how to act the days after something like that happens. The movies show intense grief and then cut to “a few weeks/years after” when things are stable.
It was really hard to figure out how to act and I decided to try to lead a normal life.
I remember I went to a therapist and said to her I felt guilty for not taking the time to suffer. She asked me “why do you think you need to suffer?”.
Why do we value suffering as some kind of symbolic gesture that will represent what we feel. Why when something bad happens to us we feel like we need to abstain from life and happiness in order to honor the moment. Why punish ourselves when we already feel bad?

There is no right or wrong. No matter what you do you are not being disrespectful to anybody. This is not the time for etiquette. This is the time to do things that you want to do. 
Her death is a permanent reality - no time will “cure it”. It doesn’t matter if it’s been a day or ten years. You don’t need to act accordingly. Act how you feel. Be honest to yourself. If you want to flirt with this girl to take your mind of this then do it. If you can’t take your mind out of it just take some time to be alone - as long as you need."

Honestly who cares that one guy saw her nudes. I mean. Other guys have seen her her naked before. It’s not something worth stressing about

Now a little story to ease your mind:
I’m now older and a little more worried about phone security but I assure you most people are completely distracted. I went to this phone assistance place to change my broken screen. They required that all the customers to give their password for them to give a warranty ( so they can test all the features on the phone). I objected because it was just a broken screen and I refused to give my password because of my pictures (not only because of the nudes but I didn’t want people to have this kind of extensive access to my personal life). They were quite offended by this and told me I was the first customer to refuse giving the password and that they were a serious company. I mean - this serious company has humans working for them how can they be sure they employees aren’t collecting data from their customers.
I was very surprised that all the clients simply give their phones away to phone techs with their password."

Don’t blame yourself for not being able to move on. If you are reacting like this it shows that this person you are with desestabilizes you.

People usually seek people with mutual interests to befriend. Maybe you cannot find too many people that like the same things as you do and that’s why you are having a hard time connecting to people.

relationship_advice,foz23aa,t3_gada6f,1588183361.0,"Not gonna lie it seems like your relationship isn’t going great. Seems like he likes your company and that this relationship makes him comfortable but that he doesn’t want to commit more than what he already has.

One thing that stands out to me is the lack of mutual interests. You guys don’t seem to share interests nor you are attracted by each others differences. This isn’t a great sign. Seems like you guys no longer enjoy communicating to each other (specially him) and you guys don’t enjoy what the other person has to offer. I wonder what brought you guys together. Can you remember that? 

Obviously during covid everything gets trickier because we are overwhelmed by so many news and it seems like the only thing that makes sense is to talk about covid and the politics around covid. Its understandable he is worried about covid and it’s understandable you are worried about trump (specially so close to the elections and in the midst of a public health crisis). It’s understandable that you both are having a hard time trying not to talk about this and failing to do so. 

Another thing that stands out to me is his behavior - playing videogames all day and going to bed at 6am. He might be a little depressed. So - before anything - it might be a good idea to ask how he is doing and how it’s his mental health. Maybe this is his way of coping with the stress of being on lockdown. But the lack of interest in other activities can be a result of some issues. Try to talk to him. 

Finally about the main issue:
1 year is way too long to wait to say I love you. If he never said it’s not because he is too sleepy but because he doesn’t feel it. And from what you described it doesn’t sound like things are going too well and that he is “getting there”.
This might be because he is a little depressed or just that he doesn’t love you or it might be that he is too comfortable in this half commitment situation always having a foot at the door. Or all of the above.
I think you should definitely talk to him but understand and manage your expectations. Talking to him about it won’t make him feel love out of a sudden. You need to understand what is this conversation really about. What do you want from this conversation? 
What do you want from him? What do you expect he will tell you?
It’s likely that this conversation will end in a possible breakup or in a dead end where he finally says he loves you but you will never know if this is just his way of dealing with this conflict. 
So approach this conversation from a very rational perspective. Maybe this conversation is about understanding what does “I love you” mean to him and what it is exactly that he doesn’t feel yet. This conversation should be about understanding his feelings.
Good luck!"

Thats not how it works. She doesn’t prove she is not racist by dating him. Don’t you know those people who make racist comments and then defend themselves saying “I’m not racist I dated a black guy” or “I’m not racist I have lots of black friends”.
Just because she is dating him it doesn’t mean she isn’t racist or that she doesn’t have hidden prejudices.

I see my black friends in interracial relationship constantly complaining about their partners being  racist or being insensitive to certain issues.
I myself am Latina and a lot of guys want to date me because of all the sexual stereotypes but have a lot a prejudices. It’s not fun to date someone who sees you deep down like the “other”.

A insensitive comment made in private usually is not an isolated fact - it’s representative of someone’s mindset and it comes along with other stuff.

Her comment 5yrs ago is a red flag for him. Understandably.
If I had a partner who said such thing I would be concerned too wondering what else this person might secretly think.

She reproduced a racist mindset. To this day she seems to have little understanding of how racist her comment was. 

Since he basically just found out that she was very influenced by racist views - more than he thought. Is he supposed to brush it off like it’s nothing?
Indeed it was 5yrs ago but this isn’t that long ago and he is probably worried about what else she might think.
