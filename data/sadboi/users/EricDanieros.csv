\- EVE's Corporations can be composed of any race. Guilds in RF Online are strictly single-race only and you can't even understand other races unless you're the race leader.

\- Each race has clear strengths and weakness, if you have a guild in two races you'll have the best of each.

\- Your example is undercover activity, not a guild that is openly estabilished in every race, and using every game function to sabotage their own race so they can estabilish a monopoly on resources and sell things through ToS-breaking RMT.

There's also no ridiculously expensive cash shop time-limited BDs like the US version had. You'll be able to acquire all gear the same way as everyone.
