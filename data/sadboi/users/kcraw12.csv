PCOSandPregnant,fp71u63,t3_gbogjj,1588362514.0,"We’ve been together 6 years and never really prevented. Actively started trying about two years ago. Then in December, I started taking Ovasitol twice a day which lead to irregular cycles becoming more regular. Then after two months of 28 day cycles, we got pregnant. Used preseed and temping. Also something that was a factor (we think): we don’t have high sex drives at all. We could go once a month and be totally satisfied. So having sex in a fertile window was a lot. We’d “save” sex for when I was fertile. When it wasn’t happening, he went to the doctor for analysis and when he filled out the sheet where it said how long it had been since he last had sex, she said “oh. That’s far too long. They lose viability. You need to wait 2-5 days. That’s it.”

So he left. And we thought, if that’s true, then we’ve been having sex with “unviable” sperm lol. I’m not entirely sure if that was a factor but all I know is, the one month we made sure to have sex before I was fertile, then a few times in the window, was the time we got pregnant. I’m including this story in case anyone else struggles with low sex drives. It may be an overlooked thing."

PCOS,f3xc8xp,t3_dikbwd,1571235828.0,"I had to explain to my husband how much I needed physical and mental support just to get me started. He’s watched me struggle with my health for years and he knows how hard it looks, but he doesn’t truly know how hard it is to just “eat right”. He agreed to do a month of my diet with me. It’s worked out for 10 days so far. Not only is it helping me stick to it, but he’s seeing how difficult it truly is to keep it up when your body is telling you to eat the carbs and sugar. 

And no, he wasn’t excited to do it. The first week was a lot of hangry attitude and complaining. But we’re doing great now!

Every doctor I’ve had and advice I’ve read emphasizes how truly difficult it is to do alone / without removing temptation from the home. It’s like asking a smoker to quit cold turkey but keeping cigarettes all over the house. 

So like someone else said, remove yourself from it if you can. Get rid of your temptations that you own and try to avoid others. Ask people ahead of time to stop offering it to you because it really is hurting you in the long run. 

None of this is easy. But you can do it! 

Lastly, give yourself a whole lot of grace. This is my, eh, 40th ish go at my diet in like 2 years. It doesn’t make it any easier when I get angry with myself."

For a while, I thought something was wrong with us, but after therapy and communication, it’s just how we roll! (Sorry for the tangent)

Anyway, we’ve been NTNP for 8 months but this month was full ovulation tests, sex every other day, temping, etc. and we’re both exhausted, but we laugh about it. 

I’ll text him a gif of a baby dancing, and he’ll reply with a thumbs up Obama (or something) and come in the bedroom. We just laugh the whole time and joke about how much “work” it is. We take turns getting to be the “lazy” one who gets to lay there and the other who has to do the moving. Idk how to explain it. But it works for us how lighthearted it is. We went into it communicating and knowing that it’s going to be a lot for us but we want a baby and it can still be enjoyable. 

Idk if any of this helps. I just think sometimes there’s this implication that if it’s not sexy, it’s work and vice versa. It can be awkward and funny and all other places in the middle which, for us, takes the pressure off."
