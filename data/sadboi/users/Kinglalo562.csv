March 31,2019. I had my dog Chispita since 2006, she was given to me by a  girlfriend I had at the time. When ever I would get home she was always there to greet me. She would be wagging her tail, and barking at me, happy to see me. I took her to the vet to have a tumor removed, it ended up being cancerous.  She recovered well but eventually she developed a tumor on her throat. She stopped eating and I could tell  she was in alot of pain. I knew what I needed to do but couldnt bring myself to do it. My father and older sister ended up taking her to the vet and she never returned. I cried,  and cried and cried. I was totally devastated, and I felt so lonely without her. Coming home and knowing she  would  not be there to greet me, or not taking  her for a walk after dinner. Not a day goes by I dont remember her and wish she was still here. I also realize that she was in alot of pain, she was suffering so much and it was the right thing to do. I know she is somewhere where she feels no pain, is running around with all the other dogs and she will be there to greet me when my time comes. Take comfort in knowing that you gave Jasmine a great life and know she will be there waiting for you when your time comes.  I'm sure Jasmine is looking down on you and misses you just as much as you miss her.  Once again I'm sorry for your loss."

On a Saturday evening in 2006, in the parking lot of a home depot, I ended up having a great conversation with an older man.  He had just finished walking his cart back as  I was getting off of my truck, he asked me something about my truck and the conversation just started flowing. We must have talked for about 3hrs just standing next to my truck. We talked about cars, family, work, and how he had recently retired and so much more. We wished each other luck and went on our way. At the time I was going through a real rough patch in my life, I felt alone and a random stranger helped me forget about all of my problems for a bit. I am a quiet, keep to myself person but it was so easy to talk to him."

They were older when they had me and were stuck in there old ways. When they lecture you, you listen, period! Any input is disrespect and your not honoring your parents, not to mention  that is a sin and dont forget god is watching. When I was 20 and I  finally realized there was something wrong with the way I was feeling, I figured I could go to them since they are my parents and  they wouldn't give me bad advice. Was I wrong,  All I got was a lecture on how dumb that sounded.  Depression doesnt exist and I'm looking for excuses, how come they were never depressed and how if they would have said something as ridiculous to there parents,  Gramps would have went to town on them with the belt and beat the depression right out of them.  According to my parents I needed to start acting like a grown man and stop looking for excuses."
