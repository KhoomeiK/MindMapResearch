From what I see clenbuterol boosts the amount of oxygen in your blood and this is what the coronavirus is doing, reducing the oxygen. 

I'm curious cos I'm currently on a clen & var cut and wondering if I'd be better off stopping till the virus is gone in case it might have adverse effects. 

I understand there's no docs here but just a general opinion is all I'm looking for. 

TL;DR Should I come off clen in case of coronavirus or could it possibly help if I got it? Thanks"
