2. Breath. I am constantly holding my breath while driving and well.. that is a major distraction.

3. Turn the music off. Don‚Äôt look at your phone... obviously

Second, take comfort in knowing that you are grown up. I blame myself for past wrongdoings all the time and the only thing that can help me feel better is knowing who I am now... 

Third, take action with your grown up self. Sometimes just knowing and being aware that you are grown up isn‚Äôt enough.. if that‚Äôs the case then take action. For example, if you are prone to emotional outbursts due to anxiety, then take action by inhibiting these emotional outbursts. Know what you did that was wrong, then make sure you don‚Äôt do those things again.. once you create a habit of right action and right decision, past wrongdoings will slowly fade away. Your guilt and regret will be gone in time. 

Last, be kind to yourself. This won‚Äôt rid of the guilt and shame, but don‚Äôt say mean things to yourself about past actions.

If it is really up to me and there aren‚Äôt too many devastating external factors at play, this could work out well... thank you for the insight!"
audiology,fg0xnpn,t1_fg0hmiz,1580417050.0,"Wow, that‚Äôs incredible.. I didn‚Äôt realize how much you can change someone‚Äôs life just simply by helping them hear and communicate. My personal goal is to help others and make a positive impact in the world which is what led me to considering the medical field.. but now that I know Audiology is more serious than it seems (researching AuD online doesn‚Äôt account for its real impact), this might be a valid option for me. I appreciate the cases you discussed, and thanks for making a difference in the world!"
audiology,fg0cyww,t1_fg07vua,1580405188.0,"Thank you, this is an interesting and honest response. I have talked to some audiologists who have directly told me not to go into the field as they are extremely upset with salary and dealing with insurance problems. I have heard that side of the field but wanted to hear the other side which you have just provided. I am shadowing an Audiologist in Feb to get a feel for what it is, but am trying to get as many perspectives as possible in order to make a decision. Again, thank you!"
Futurology,fg00oqy,t1_ffzy6f8,1580397592.0,"True, we could have more of a say with our privacy regarding our personal electronics if there were a more solidified consent process. However, if facial recognition were implemented, it would be impossible to have a say in our privacy. So yes they are probably currently tracking us with our personal electronics, but at least there is still a possibility we can opt out of data tracking completely in the future..."
Futurology,ffzxq2r,t1_ffydqhv,1580395576.0,That‚Äôs scary as crap... but doesn‚Äôt the government already have all of this information via our cell phones and computers and such?
Anxiety,ffxlhnl,t3_evnz0k,1580327554.0,Dang man... you are a strong ass human being. Thank you for spreading your hope and spirit
