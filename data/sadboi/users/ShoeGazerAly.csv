penpalsover30,fix38xv,t3_f9r2ly,1582811534.0,"Hey! I'm 34/F American, married, one kid. I love Gothic humor as well and that whole aesthetic. I'm a music geek. I've actually been called a snob before, but I just know what I like and can be a little opinionated when asked. I love Corgis. We have a good boy who is 11 years old (I will definitely share pics of him!). I make candles with my husband in my spare time as well. I love to read when I have the time. I love being outdoors too. Message me if anything that I'm saying sounds even remotely interesting!"
ptsd,fhh92de,t3_f2u17y,1581597982.0,"I just scored a 72. Now, I'm on an antidepressant that has been super helpful and it's been really nice. I was not expecting a score that high. I had tried therapy, but it didn't really work for me because I'm a pretty private person and am really shy with people I don't know so that comfort level was never there. I know that medication isn't for everyone, but I do recommend trying it if therapy doesn't work for you."

AskReddit,f47i4y6,t3_djlwrc,1571422675.0,I have a very large pancreas.  I had a scan done and it showed that it was enlarged. They kept asking me if I've been in any pain lately. I had been just fine. Turns out I just have a larger pancreas than what looks normal for my body.

ptsd,eyz3kuf,t3_czgwxk,1567608743.0,"I think often times most people don't know what to say and so they just say what they think they should. They are trying to be nice. I just take it for what it is. They're trying to make me feel better. I just smile and say thank you, but it doesn't help. When they bring religion into it, I want to roll my eyes. I think them saying these things helps them feel better more than it helps me, but whatever. I just let it go. It makes no difference to me."

ptsd,es6kmrh,t3_c5t8qw,1561651438.0,"I hate loud noises like doors slamming, especially unexpectedly. I startle very easily and I usually get very angry which can sometimes result in me crying. I rarely ever have flashbacks anymore, but I don't think this response to loud, sudden noises will ever go away."
hygge,erpw8sq,t3_c38n78,1561129491.0,"I think every year summer hygge gets easier and easier. I have discovered that reading on the swing that lays down, out on my deck with a glass of freshly made mint iced tea on a warm summer day is perfect. Another summer hygge activity that I love is sitting around a campfire, watching the stars and listening to the crackle of the fire. It's wonderful."

ptsd,eq374p1,t3_bwycgz,1559750661.0,"Does talking about it help? Writing things down, at least for me, doesn't help because it's too permanent. But talking to someone, even if it's not a professional, really helps. Not necessarily to get any opinions or advice, but just to vent and have someone who cares to listen. I'm here if you want to talk. You shouldn't have to live like this, but you shouldn't give up either. You are stronger than you believe."
ptsd,eq362rd,t3_bwzqzx,1559750155.0,That is not ok. Maybe see if they will go with you to therapy so they can understand just how serious this is. My husband and I will laugh about it if something happens and it makes me jump. I have a sensitive startle reflex too due to trauma. He would never purposely do something to make it happen just so he could laugh at me though. You need them to understand why this isn't ok and for them to start taking this seriously.

I think what is also a struggle is that my daughter has trauma too and it is challenging trying to raise her to be better and more improved than I am when we both have our issues. We will all be attending family therapy next month and I hope it helps to try to live happier with each other. Hopefully I can learn how to better help with her needs and better control my own emotions."

They don't tell you how much harder it is to do that when you get older. I love learning about different cultures and ways of living. I am a music nerd and can talk about it for hours on end.  If you want, you can DM me. If not, that's ok too."
Ghostbc,eo91nc9,t3_bpe7kj,1558379963.0,I often wonder if Peter would have enjoyed Ghost. It would have been an amazing tour to experience if they could have had that opportunity.
