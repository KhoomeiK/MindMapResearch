As stupid as it sounds I still hope sometimes that they‚Äôre doing better.

So even if I got a good response idk if it‚Äôs the best idea because I would overthink everything between us, and if I got a bad response it would just reinforce how shitty I felt when it initially happened. 

I think they‚Äôre just dealing with things in their life in a very negative way, and when I see that I can‚Äôt help but try to fix it, and then I start becoming too much, it‚Äôs probably just best I keep it the way it is now and let them do them.

Last text i got was them telling me i was just making things worse for them because i caused stress on them. 

It's honestly just such a complicated story that i cant explain it through text. But ive come to accept what i did wrong and what i couldve done better, as well as understand things that were out of my control that i just need to let go and move on. 

I wouldn't say they had a mental breakdown, but they were just going through so much stuff all of which they told me about, so i became very worried and protective of this person but felt there was nothing i could do to help because in their mind i wasnt enough or wasnt the right person. So the only option they really had was to just cut me completely        

As well as I couldnt see myself being able to be strictly friends with this person so it was partly my fault as well in that aspect.

I think the game needs to make the difficulties more clear tho, they aren‚Äôt really meant to be the difficulty ur playing at and should more so be seen as a mini world tier. U wouldn‚Äôt beat the game and expect to do world tier 5 with ur world tier 1 drops. Same goes for hard-heroic.

thedivision,fk4lhi1,t1_fk4art9,1583862793.0,"As well as I feel the difficulty of heroics doesn‚Äôt come from ‚Äúbullet sponge‚Äù enemies but rather lack of focus as a group to kill the enemies that should be targeted.

I‚Äôve done some cp4 solo and yeah they‚Äôre difficult but I wouldn‚Äôt say unbalnced, and that‚Äôs with a build that‚Äôs nowhere near optimized. I have a crit build and take down enemies on 2-3 clips of an AR and that seems like a fine balance for HEROIC difficulty

It‚Äôs like in God of War, there‚Äôs a ‚Äúgive me god of war‚Äù difficulty, every enemy can nearly 1 shot u, and take a beating to kill. It‚Äôs fucking hard and u die a lot before u get used to it. Nobody is saying it‚Äôs unbalanced because u opted into that experience. It‚Äôs hard on purpose and is meant to be a fucking challenge.

I made this point in another post, heroic and more so legendary aren‚Äôt meant for the people grinding 1 hour a day, it‚Äôs meant for people that are dedicated and want to challenge their skill/builds. The devs have been very VERY clear on that. Heroic isn‚Äôt meant to be doable with a 30% crit build with 50% crit dmg it‚Äôs meant for a min/maxed max crit max crit dmg build. That u refine by getting the rolls in heroic.

But instead everyone wants to be able to do it right at lvl 40 then wonder why there‚Äôs no end game. HEROIC IS END GAME that‚Äôs ur goal post lvl 40 get gear good enough to clear it. The only people that could possibly have that good of a build play 12 hours a day.

thedivision,fk4e9m3,t1_fk2g5cr,1583858739.0,"I‚Äôd argue that if a skill build was anywhere near that strong it would be overpowered, u could just run a turret and a drone and just sit in the corner of a room and wait for the enemies to die

As well as with a DPS weapon build u r being vulnerable when u shoot and often need to hide which lowers dps, and with a skill build u now have abilities outputting damage as well as urself with ur own gun.

And there are many talents that increase skill damage by a good amount. 

This guy just made 1 dps build and assumed skill builds don‚Äôt compare without actually trying one and comparing them together. That post is purely an assumption.

I had people always making snarky comments about me washing my hands, or getting frustrated at me because I had to wash my hands. It can be hard

But it still just gets brushed off as something ur doing to urself"

Tbh this is the first time I think I‚Äôve truly experienced the feeling of depression, and I think a lot of people (myself included) don‚Äôt understand what actual depression can feel like.

It gets thrown around so much nowadays that it gets overlooked a lot when people r truly suffering from it. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get better, just gonna take some time for my situation, thanks for the response"

Anxiety,eql8jcl,t3_bysxyc,1560139280.0,"The leg shaking and twitching are common symptoms for anxiety. I often rub my hands together or rub my palm with my thumb, sort of as a comforting technique.

There r videos on YouTube about body language, and these r all things people do when they r in a stressful or uncomfortable situation.

I would become super uncomfortable and self conscious of how loudly i was breathing. It would cause that feeling of taking a deep breath but feeling like i only got 1/4 of the breath actually absorbed.

Just thinking about those situations is giving me that feeling now again"

Anxiety,eq0ydz6,t1_eq0xa3y,1559697217.0,"Yeah, I completely know what U mean by it being a feeling. Its almost like a hum or a vibration through ur head/body, its like when ur being held down to the ground by someone, and u try to fight to get out of it, theres this slight bit of panic that comes over u, because u feel stuck and i guess the body sort of freaks out by it (fight or flight I guess?) 

but it feels like that, but nothing is happening."
Anxiety,eq0vsz2,t1_eq09vcr,1559695530.0,"Yeah it can get very intense while high, to the point that it almost makes me question reality at times, because i feel so disconnected from whats going on. I find it causes a feeling of panic, and it FEELS like my heart is racing, but im usually able to focus on my physical body and realize my heart is actually beating at a normal speed. It's helped me a lot honestly to understand that anxiety is a feeling, not a physical danger. 

Like a few months ago, I had my first anxiety experience while high. I felt scared and like i was going to pass out, but talking to other people, I was completely normal and didnt look panic'd at all.

I've been having the feeling a lot more while sober the last week or so, and I get a feeling of panic, but I'm usually able to ground myself and keep going.

I'm glad to know that I;m not the only person that has this experience, because it has been stressing me out a little. Good Luck on getting better. I had this a few months ago and got through it, so I know I can get through it again. It just takes time"
Anxiety,eq0ob4p,t1_eq0bp3g,1559689848.0,"Man U remind me a lot of myself, I‚Äôm 18 now, and was in a similar situation at ur age. Ur super mature for ur age, and if ur anything like me, u probably feel like u r more mature than the other people ur age and maybe like u don‚Äôt fit in very well.

If it is like that the only advice I can give is don‚Äôt do things for the sake of others. I went through school not going to parties and at this point, don‚Äôt like parties or drinking or anything to do with that sort of stuff. But the last couple years I‚Äôve been doing it, having other people tell me how to enjoy life, and what is enjoyable, instead of doing the things I want to do. (Mostly people telling me to go to parties and drink, even though they just cause anxiety and I never enjoy being there)

The thing for me is that I would rather have 1 super good and close friend than have 20 people that I kind of know. I take friendships very seriously and don‚Äôt want to do things I don‚Äôt want to do, just to impress others. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm kinda rambling, it seems like u have a good grasp on what u want. Just keep doin u man"

I‚Äôve been contemplating deleting the apps on my phone for a while, but I think it would eat away at me deep down not having them. And I fucking hate that that‚Äôs how it is nowadays.

Also, just know that the people u see posting on social media a lot, looking like they‚Äôre having the time of their life are probably dealing with a lot of shit themselves, and social media is a way for them to get gratification for what they r doing from others, so they can feel they actually mean something. It‚Äôs honestly depressing and I hate everything about it."
Anxiety,eq091i4,t1_eq04kvg,1559680271.0,"If u truly r friends with somebody, it shouldn‚Äôt require a social media to stay in touch...

Anxiety,epygetr,t3_bwlsqm,1559633245.0,"Been doing this a lot the last couple weeks about a person I like. 
It gives a slight bit of hope that maybe the situation could happen and if it did I would be relieved, but then I realize it will never happen and it raises my anxiety. 
I‚Äôve been trying to stop myself from thinking about the future and the past like that because it causes a lot of stress on myself, but at the same time feels comforting. It can be pretty tough

Edit: I will often want the situation to happen that I will try to stray conversations into that situation to see how it actually plays out, often leaving me disappointed when it doesn‚Äôt work out"
