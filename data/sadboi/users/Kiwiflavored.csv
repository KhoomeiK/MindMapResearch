You ought to be kinder on yourself, and indulgent when the mood requires it; there is no need to be unhelpfully distracted. Listen to cheesy and cathartic songs. Lie under a blanket and think all sorts of things. Reach out to loved ones, and friends, or perhaps a therapist. Take a long bath or walk. Journal.

Demonizing all feminists as power-hungry men haters enables you to stick your head in the sand and miss out on the merits of equal opportunities for all.

 Gendercides (being the primary victim of violent crime, war, prison rape), alimony and custody inequalities, and prescriptions and proscriptions for behaviors that align with or contradict the dominant ideal of masculinity are all issues of sexism *against* men, and just as feminism seeks to level out the rights of the sexes, so too the discriminations.

1. You took the time out to type this up and parade your gender bias—gender bias referring to beliefs and attitudes that involve stereotypes and preconceived ideas about the roles, abilities, and characteristics of males and females that may contain significant distortions and inaccuracies.
E.g. Women are more pathetic than men in their quest for validation, which is all they seek out.

2. Perceived attractiveness=self esteem
E.g. Somebody else finding someone attractive must be objective to both parties and totally renders their want of opinions and expression null.

3. That compliments are a finite resource. 
E.g. The beautiful women are taking away the much needed flattery from incels!

Without giving specific product recommendations because you and your hair are very different from my own, I think a scalp scrub or clarifying shampoo could be a helpful first step to get rid of the yuckies that have built up after a while and to make your hair more receptive to a nice mask.
I do echo other people's suggestions to deep condition. It can impart moisture which can improve the texture and shine of your hair, while making it more elastic. And hair that is hydrated and flexible, means less breakage. Protein also plays an integral part in strengthening your hair to resist dryness and breakage, and for me, a protein treatment is due right around every month. apHogee and Green Beauty make hardcore protein treatments, but I think your best bet would be to to find a good deep conditioner with a hefty amount of moisturizing ingredients and protein.
Finding a styler that can easily be reactivated could perhaps multiply your good hair days and keep your 'do looking better for longer.
Having little cheat products, like dry shampoo, or a reviving foam or spray can ease the really tough days. If you've got looser curls, a cheat routine that does take a little effort and consistency can help if you can't style your hair in the morning or everyday. You can give a little energy at night, and there are all kinds of overnight techniques to give you awesome looking hair like flexi rods, sock or headband curls, or just twisting or braiding it. Unravel in the morning and that's it."

Naturalhair,f4k2e5r,t3_dklo77,1571632912.0,"Making sure your hair is very clean a great start. Sulfate shampoos can actually be good for this (and pre-poos and a stellar deep conditioner can maybe quell fears about dryness). I don't have the same hair type, but I am a fan of clay masks to get rid of product build up, sebum and impurities on my scalp, and to clump my curls. It definitely resets my pattern and reduces frizz!

Properly hydrating and detangling can help bring definition as well. You can add honey and steam to your deep conditioning routine as honey is a humectant and will pull the water vapor into the hair. Using detangling brushes (in my case) has helped respect the elasticity of my hair, smoothed my cuticle, and has thoroughly gotten rid of knots and snarls to group my strands together and form curls that bounce back when I pull the brush away. 

You can't talk about moisture without also mentioning protein. A good protein treatment can strengthen the hair, give it structure, and reduce breakage. I like to use bond repairing treatments to also strengthen my hair without protein overload. A treatment like that works on the disulfide bonds in hair to mend damage from chemical treatments, manipulation, and heat. 

Styling is super subjective, but the other commenter has some truth with suggesting a gel. Tighter textures can get more control with a good holding gel, jelly, or custard. In my experience, starting with soaking wet hair, sectioning it into smaller sections, applying liberal product, and shingling give me good definition. You can always force a new (temporary) pattern with finger coiling, twist outs and braid outs, and the like. 

YMMV but I hope this helps."
