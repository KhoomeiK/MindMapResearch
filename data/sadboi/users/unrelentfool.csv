As for the accents, I’m sure you must have made sure they’ll stay in place, but they might cause some discomfort to the baby? She could totally frame it as a decoration for Holly’s bedroom :) Anyway, your friend will love it."

However the problem is that thoughts lead to emotions and the result is how we behave. I haven’t self harmed since 21st of last June. At first I made a pact with my FP and that was enough to keep me going. Then said FP broke up with me (horrible timing btw, I had just gotten out of 6 months outpatient treatment) and I never felt so scared in my life. I was keeping it all under control because of that pact and because he’d help me whenever I asked for help.

Now that FP is gone and I’ve given myself -just a week- to “mourn” the relationship and that I’m finally able to access CBT, I managed to reduce the amount of times that I want to hurt myself. 

Like most days it doesn’t even occur to me.

I’ve gone from planning the end to not even thinking about it in 6 weeks.

It’s possible. If you thinking you’re losing that can only be because you haven’t lost yet. There is a lot that can still be done (believe me) and you have already taken the first step even if it means talking about it with complete strangers.
DM if you want, I’d love to hear from you. Idk if I can help but at least I’ll read whatever you write and respond to it.
All my well wishes, keep strong!"
socialskills,fcxqui0,t3_ejfsv9,1578069253.0,"I have an idea!
Step 1: buy a beginners ukulele. 
Step 2: buy some treats for your neighbours. Step 3: leave treats by their door with a note introducing yourself and saying you got a new ukulele. Ask them to please let you know if they get bothered by the noise.

That’s what my neighbour (and currently boyfriend) did when he moved in. Every one in the building ended up showing up to say thanks for the treats and to let him know they couldn’t hear anything :)

Obviously  you don’t have to learn to play the uke but maybe you could end up getting into it, it’s fun!

Might be a crazy idea but I thought I’d offer it anyway.  Good luck!"

As you say, she’s in a dire situation already. If you’re a “stranger” that can’t give her a solution then why even say anything at all?"

BPD,f045ud6,t1_f03p1gy,1568380371.0,I read somewhere that it’s not uncommon for people with bpd to change names. I used my middle name until I was 28 then started introducing myself to people saying my first name. It’s a mess because the people who knew me before the change me still call me the old name and my mother didn’t accept it well at all
