Thank you! I tried a therapist but for some reason she was more concerned about talking about her life so i kind of opted out from seeing her, now i see a really good doctor and hopefully in the next week i’ll be speaking with a health psychologist a couple times a month to help me! i think mine has to do with hormones because i was told that, but i’m a really worry-some person. I don’t think trauma effects me but maybe some memories from the past / things i’ve done or things that have happened to me that i haven’t let go. Not awfully horrible but you know how we get mad at ourselves wishing we did things different. I guess what I realize is i can handle the mental side of anxiety but it results in extreme panic attacks where i feel like passing out, i shake, i cry hard, i have diarrhea, i get a fast heart rate and i get palpitations and i’ve had them checked and their benign PVCS, they started in September when my panic / anxiety became awful. My doctor said this may go away randomly to. I take 10mg celexa just to try and cope with it right now it’s just a bandaid to help me while i get other treatment like the psychologist. I just want to be okay and feel normal again, the medicine is helping but i want to do it without it eventually too."

My mom also took my BP before bed at 11:00pm and it was 123/82, so it is intact okay. I’m convinced my mother in laws blood pressure device is a tad old, because i’ve never exceeded a pressure over 135/89 so when hers said 150/99 i was like hm... lol

50 lbs would put me at the right weight for my height and such. Even 40lbs but I also want to be comfortable in my body so i really want this to happen. I have real bad health anxiety even though i’m quite healthy and so losing the weight that my previous medication put on me will help my health anxiety simmer down I think. I’m on celexa right now 10mg it’s nice it’s helping. I was having palpitations not a ton of them but some before the medicine and my ekg only showed a couple in which my doctor said their benign and that i’m okay it’s from panic / my mind. I haven’t had them since i started the medicine but had a couple last night boy do they scare me...

Anxiety,fjk0c1u,t1_fjjz1ha,1583417086.0,Yeah I understand I’m just really scary I had a hard time winning off of Lexapro and Effexor so I’m dreading getting on this but I guess at this point I really do need to considering I’m having panic attacks every day my anxieties every day I’m throwing up and shaking from it and I’m getting heart palpitations I’m open to trying medicine I guess but just the side effects that I read really scare me but you’re right I should be ok I’m only starting off with 10 mg for two weeks and then going up to 20 mg and then I will see him at the end of the month to see how I’m doing

I’m really scared just because i googled the side effects even though I shouldn’t have and I saw heart problems and seizures. I already have heart palpitations because of my anxiety. I’m just scared to die! this my how i struggle with anxiety / panic.

i know some side effects happen but i’m extremely scared. i haven’t been on a medication since February 2019. i was on lexapro & it was fine but i just got off because i thought i was strong enough but i wasn’t i need help so my doctor prescribed me this"

Anxiety,fje10fz,t1_fjdzh80,1583263112.0,"u/emberuzumaki you are the sweetest human i’ve ever talked to on here. i appreciate all of that so much. i’m really trying to have high hopes it’s not anything more serious because i’m 23 and pretty healthy but you’re right it’s better to know then keep sitting here and wondering what’s happening to me... hoping for good news but we’ll see. the anxiety really ruins my life and makes me think so awfully. i’d love to DM for moral support, having someone to connect with over heart palpitations is something i really need. and anxiety over all. it’s tomorrow at 2pm!"
Anxiety,fjdwi3q,t1_fj8wult,1583260613.0,"u/emberuzumaki tomorrow i have a doctors apt i found a real good doctor who will be my primary doctor who i will now see. my moms going with me it’s tomorrow at 2, but i’m super frightened because i get PVCS sometimes randomly when i’m not having panic or anxiety. like i said my HR and BP are perfect but what if there is more to it? my ecg was good just some palps and im scared i can’t stop pacing. i’m overweight but not awfully i don’t eat really bad what if my cholesterol is bad? i’m getting testing for every thing: i’m really scared for the doctor apt."

thank you for that. i have a doctors apt tomorrow at 2pm. i was told i’m having benign PVCS. and that they’ll go away??"
PanicAttack,fjcp1jk,t1_fjc8bxe,1583230309.0,"u/kattegatnat 

thank you for sharing that with me! my bp is around 118/69 so it’s quite good along with my resting heart rate. ECG showed everything was good other than a couple PVCS which the doctor said are benign and that they will go away. i’m just extremely anxious and panic a lot... i refuse to get on a daily medicine also so i’m with you on that. i had terrible experiences on medicine"
Anxiety,fjay34c,t1_fjaxneo,1583182801.0,"u/emberuzumaki i actually have tried klonopin...i liked it, it calmed me and i was awake not sleepy. is that a medicine you don’t have to take everyday tho? i only took it twice"

Wow, this is so helpful and like music to my hear to hear this. I hear so many different answers on what anxiety is and what causes it and i mean their all related but still different and i feel in denial about my anxiety / panic. i’ve had it since i was a little girl and i’m 23 now. They labeled them as benign PVCS. my anxiety thinks their going to kill me or stop my heart randomly, aside from needing to lose 40lbs i’m a healthy girl the doctors said and they actually said my weights fine not a factor in this but i won’t lie i haven’t been working out as much because i am scared of the heart palpitations and my anxiety thinks if i have PVCS i can’t workout which is leading me to NOT gaining but NOT losing the weight needed..."

Why do you think ativan is better? i honestly just am great fun for anything that helps me during the moment of help. and i’m so sorry about that, poor thing. you’re perfect how you are."
PanicAttack,fjansbd,t1_fjambxo,1583177128.0,"u/wrwagneriii3 do you get palpitations? i also have been told by doctors i’m a healthy girl and that these are benign PVCS and they will go away because i wasn’t born with them.. i’m 23 and worry every day that i’m going to die when i get the couple PVC’s that i have.

they don’t hurt or anything but my anxiety and panic make them worse and scare me"

hi, and lol thanks 😂 so i saw a therapist and tried seeking out CBT but all she did was talk about herself so i had to leave her... sad"
Anxiety,fj8z175,t1_fj8yuq5,1583126349.0,"u/emberuzumaki honestly my mom didn’t mention a specific one but she said like a light dose of xanax on the side or ativan or potentially a light everyday medicine. but i was in effexor for 1.5 years went from 125-215 in a year and it made me sick. tried lexapro it was okay, hated topamax... i think also i get panic from my self image. i’m currently 185 but want to be 140. but i also lost that weight with working out a lot and like mentioned i haven’t because of my heart scares"
Anxiety,fj8yjo2,t1_fj8y9oa,1583125917.0,"u/emberuzumaki yes college from 9-4 M-F and work 5 days as well so i’m quite busy, but it’s a habit now. I am done with school in a little over a month. my moms cardiologist suggest i get on a light medication until i’m done with college and am less busy. her cardiologist also mentioned that these PVCs don’t kill and they i should get my cholesterols checked just to be safe since i’m 23. but i guess i’m not conscious of stress? only of panic  / anxiety. it’s real nice to have someone like you who can relate and help me here. i love lavender i’ve been drinking a lot of non caffeinated teas to help myself also. i will try all your tips and tricks and take your advice. i just really needed to know i wasn’t the only one feeling like i’m going to die during panic attacks and palpitations. 😞 thank you for that again"
Effexor,fj8y2f4,t3_fc3iuj,1583125499.0,I took effexor for 1.5 years gained 80 lbs on it and had the worst brain zaps of my life along with throwing up from withdrawals when weaned off. i actually had a better experience in lexapro
Anxiety,fj8xyay,t3_fc1fdr,1583125399.0,this is me everyday. especially with panic and anxiety...my doctor tells me one thing and i leave the doctors happy and then the next day i’m like hold on is he messing with me? was that good news? hang in there ❤️
Anxiety,fj8xm0o,t1_fj8wult,1583125111.0,"u/emberuzumaki you’re right about the water thing, i’ve found my tolerance finally. when i went to the ER i was having palpitations and a panic attack which he gave me xanax to calm down. my heart rate heightens and lowers like a heart should and he reassured me i wouldn’t die and i’m a healthy girl is what he said and my numbers were good i just am anxious and potentially OCD about my palps but that’s because i’m scared! he told me i can work out and so did the urgent care doc but you know how scary it is. 

but one quick question. i wasn’t born with these, they only started about 6-8 months ago when my anxiety / panic became a bit worse and i started college 30 hours a week with working 30 hours a week; i don’t feel stressed to often but i do get anxious a lot. i have high hopes since i wasn’t born with it it’ll just go away like the docs say"
