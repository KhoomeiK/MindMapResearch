lgbt,fqkxaix,t3_gjggiu,1589439067.0,"I'm sorry you feel that way, luv!

I just realised (2 days ago) that I'm pansexual. I'm female, 38, and have been married to the first boyfriend I ever had. We've been married for 17 years. At this point, my attraction to women has been steadily growing, but my attraction to my husband is still there. 

You're not a shitty person, dear. You're being honest! And that's ok!! That's healthy! Not just for you, but also your relationship!

What are his views of gay people, in general?"
lgbt,fqkwrpe,t3_gjgc93,1589438604.0,"Hey there! 38f here! 

First off, I'll give you some of the best advice given to me: Know that it is 100% OK to not know right now. It's ok to explore. It's ok to be in the stage of figuring yourself out. Enjoy the process!

For my story? I was also raised in a very conservative household. I was told by family and friends and, well, everyone, really, that my ""attraction"" to girls was just me wanting to be LIKE them. ...And I thought I was still straight because I liked a lot of androgynous women and non-binary/gender-fluid people. So maybe I was just attracted to the ""butch"" side of them? (Even though my first real crush was SUPER feminine)

I'm only just now figuring things out myself (at 38!)!! I am 17 years married (to my first real boyfriend), so I've never had the opportunity to even kiss another girl. Yes, my situation is a bit different ... I am happily married and love being with my hubby. But sometimes I think about women during... and I usually think about women (instead of men) when I masturbate. (But since I usually fantasize about being a man having sex with women, I thought it had to do with ""taking control, sexually"" because of my past sexual abuse.)

Up until 2 days ago I thought that I was straight with some bi-curious tendencies thrown in. But I found TikTok a couple of weeks ago. All these hot/cute/funny/etc people started popping up on my For You Page. It was a lot more exposure to gals/non-binary/gender-fluid people of my ""type"" that I'm not used to seeing. And some of them post ""thirst traps"" where they're just looking seductively at the camera... And I've only had a couple of women look at me like that in real life (which I LOVED but wouldn't let myself see that as a sign). And I'm finding that ... I really like it. 

But here's the thing... Just because I've never SLEPT with a woman, doesn't mean I'm not attracted to them. Heterosexual people don't need to ""prove"" to themselves that they are hetero by sleeping with someone of the opposite sex! They just know they have an attraction. (ie: I don't have to cheat on my hubby, or become poly, just to ""prove"" to myself that I'm pansexual).

To take this one step deeper... One of my good friends is asexual, but romantic. She's a trans woman who identifies as lesbian and is married to another trans woman. Anyway! She and I have talked about how we want to make out with eachother (another sign). She wants to be romantic with me, but not sexual (because she's asexual). But that doesn't mean that she's not a lesbian!

Anyway. There's a spectrum to everything! Know that nothing is black or white here. It's as varied as the rainbow 😊 

At this moment I'm considering changing my name on TikTok and coming out as Pan to just the people there. I'm not sure... I have a phone appointment with my super understanding Therapist on Friday morning, so I'll be talking with her then. 

I hope that at least some of my story resonated with you in some small way!! Again: you DO NOT need to know right now. I know how it feels and it's like there's an urgency sometimes. But it's ok to discover. You're ok. I'm here if you want to chat more! 💜🌈💜"

I've only had my natural hair color (dark brown) for most of my life, and then a out 2 or 3 years ago I dyed it purple, and I never went back. It's like my signature now. Haha! I don't bleach it myself because even at the salon they have to use 20 developer and let it sit quite awhile. So I'm afraid to do it myself. Especially because I'd need to ONLY do the brown sections (minimum overlapping on the purple or I'll break). And at this point I'd also need to do two passes, leaving the inch closest to the scalp til last because it's hotter and it'll bleach faster and just... No. I'm scared of all of that. Haha!"

Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fn3cav1,t1_fn2megb,1586617743.0,"Yeah... The worst part is that idk how to fix it or if it can be fixed. Part of our little place (converted 2 story 2 car garage) is underground. So when water soaks into the ground and starts pooling outside, it starts coming through our wall, near the floor. Sucks. Only happens during big rainfall though, but it does cause mold and a musty smell and I hate that!"
