You can tell him all about it but it doesnt have to make sense because he doesnt think like a disordered person. 

As someone who is an anorexic girl in a relationship with a very no-nonsense, logical, non-disordered man, I must say it has become clear that he cares so much about ME and my FEELINGS and SPENDING HIS TIME WITH ME that if I felt bad about the way I looked he would feel bad but disagree and therefore not *understand* what the issue is. *Because* *he* *sees* *no* *flaws* ! And, if I was sad about not fitting into clothes I liked, as a guy who doesnt care that much about fashion, he doesnt *understand* why I care what I'm wearing, especially because *he thinks i look good in most anything*  . Lastly, if he and I were discussing getting food, 1.he is hungry, people get irritable when they have low bloodsugar/aka/ghrelin/aka/ *hunger* . 2. You guys made an agreement. Although you didnt do anything that could be defined as ""dishonest"", you broke trust in your relationship by breaking *rapport* , by not following through with what you said, and by providing a reason that wasnt something that he could understand and come to terms with. 

Your feelings about this are 100% valid. 

I must also include the side I see for him as an attempt to make his actions seem less like an attack because I dont want you to feel bad or attacked. Relationships are hard so I'm just trying to share my thoughts on the matter. Your scenario could be different. But please consider how foreign and confusing your thoughts must be for others when you cant fully explain them or solve them yourself ‚ô°

Take care of yourself


Oh ps, dont take this situation to heart! There is always tomorrow! I'm sorry your clothes stopped fitting for now. Hope is not lost. You are aware that the lack of movement and over indulgence is a detriment so if you start taking tiny steps in the opposite direction when you can I'm sure that you will be able to wear your skirts again comfortably soon.  You guys spending time together is more important than how you look I promise. I know that's hard to see sometimes, and it can be uncomfortable when you are self concious. When I feel down on my self I just try to use all my attention and energy on observing my partner and my surroundings in the moment.
