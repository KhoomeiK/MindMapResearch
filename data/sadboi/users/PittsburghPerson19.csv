datingoverthirty,fkkjfui,t3_fiywmc,1584285401.0,"I'm 45. Here's what I've found:

1. If you take care of yourself, are well kept, and own who you are to the point that it doesn't bother you whatsoever, your attitude radiates happiness, and people find it easy to be around you, which is the very definition of attraction.

2. I've had six long term relationships in that time, and about that many short lived ones. Each woman fell on different places in the body type spectrum. Some thin, some not. My weight didn't stop me from dating a variety of people, all with different backgrounds. The common thread was most treated me like I was heroin. One was so obsessed with me she left me 43 voicemails one night when she couldn't get a hold of me. I mean, damn.

I've personally lost 90 pounds. I have another 60 or so to go. That's nuts. But it happened because despite #1 and #2, I hated myself to the core. All those relationships fizzled because I felt lost. I have deep seated hurt that keeps me from being happy. Not even being idolized by a partner was enough to pump me up.

So I have spent a long time single, because I was tired of failing. I wanted to be truly happy. I need my own internal pump, my heart, to be solid, because other people don't have enough heart capacity to keep two people happy. It's just not possible.

I realized the only one who had a problem with my weight was me. I ate because you get a hit of contentment from eating. I used food to cope with being fat. This is the same mental dynamic heroin addicts get into eventually. They think being clean isn't possible for them, so they use - still truly wishing they were not using. 

I'm healing. To the people who are not sympathetic to those who are overweight, seriously... Fuck you. You're a bastard. You should be ashamed of yourself for not being kind and seeing that in a lot of cases, people are overweight because they have some real emotional wounds, and they use food to cope. This isn't the case with all people who are overweight of course, but many people like me sure as hell feel that way. You can at least be kind. That's the bare minimum as a decent human being!

Anyway, your prognosis is probably good if you can own who you are and know your value. People will find you attractive and you will have relationships. 

Long term, you need to search your soul very, very deeply. If you have hurt in you, wounds you haven't healed, then that is what is keeping you from ultimate success. I applaud you working on yourself. It means you have things you're setting right for yourself, and you will only continue to feel better as a result.

I think that's why this stuff makes me upset, like it probably makes others upset. The reason whey I am single hinges on so many things - so many factors. It's that way for others who are single too. And we want to figure it all out so badly, but there's so much grey area, that you just can't reconcile all of your feelings about it at once. You just have to hang a sign on it in your mind that says ""in process"" and leave it at that. You tweak your routines here and there, and in the end you have inevitable success if you're making an effort that has been carefully considered.

dating,fk7acfh,t3_fgjfi7,1583931979.0,"I don't in any way identify as an incel. However, I have had spells where I thought I'd never have another relationship again. Quite a bit of that has been lately.

Maybe you don't so much need to accept that ""women have it easier"" than men dating. I don't think that's the case. Some women have a incredibly hard time being accepted and aren't asked on dates, and it's usually because they aren't following some ambiguous beauty standard, or they don't fit into most guys idea of a ""hot"" woman.

In contrast, some women are considered ""hot"", and to most men they're not thought of as much other than a walking, talking sex toy. And then there's the phenomena of getting hate messages back from a guy when they politely tell them they aren't exactly what they are looking for. That's certainly never happened to me as a guy. Not once has a woman called me a whore because I didn't want to date them. In fact, they've gone out of their way to tell me if they aren't what I want, that they were okay with me saying so. They were almost apologetic in advance (BTW Ladies, don't do that. You've got nothing to apologize for when you did no wrong).

So women have challenges too, just not the same ones. Guys have a challenge of having to be strong and brave and tough in the face of nearly all adversity. If Superman vented about all of his problems to Lois Lane, she would have ghosted him for another guy at the Daily Planet. And I don't think women expect Men to be robotic - women do want men to show their emotional side at times, but they're just not looking to spend their lives with a man so weakened by the World that he can't muster the courage to go out and make a difference in it.

Guys also have the challenge of having to be a constant ""problem solver"". So even if we don't have it all figured out, we need to project that we can figure it all out, and are more than happy to help women when they need direction. So you start to see here that Men are expected to be supportive, stoic, and strong, and Women are expected to be appreciative, humble, and validating.

Since the last part of the 20th century, these dynamics are being challenged. It's the main reason for the pushback from people who consider themselves ""traditionalist"" or ""conservative"". Women are realizing they don't have to be a constant cheerleader to a man, and men are also realizing that they have feelings, and they feel sorrow, doubt, and unsure of themselves from time to time. That causes friction, it stirs things up. A man talking about his feelings runs against what a woman generally expects from a man, and a woman who doesn't adhere to a megafan attitude toward a man is confusing to men. Strong women, vulnerable men. It shakes things up, and the reaction is bad in some cases. So society in general would do well to try and understand each other more, but isn't that always the case, and has been throughout history?!?!?

People who think they are ""Incels"" would do much better if they thought more about who they *really* are as opposed to who they *think* they are. Even moreso, they should think of what kind of partner would fit into what they're lives are about. Someone who likes things they like. Someone who likes things that they might get interested in or have wanted to get into. Someone who would appreciate them for their strengths. That's when a person is able to spot a good potential partner when they see them or talk to them. I bet there have been women who you met or talked to that were a good fit for your life, but you were so clouded by generalized anger and woe, you didn't see it.

I have to remind myself of this stuff all the time. If I didn't, I'd be right there with the confused, lonely, and spiteful - writing diatribes about how everything is stacked against me/us. And as always, the truth doesn't line up with that.

I'm glad you're not as angry as you used to be, but I also hope that you tweak your understanding of how things are a little so you give yourself a bit of a break. From there I feel you could grow more, and as a result meet someone who can't stand the thought of not being with you. And in the end, that's all we want anyway."

I have been working to re-frame the way I think about it. I'm now trying to go about it as an opportunity to meet people, and I just leave it at that. For a very long time I've had a hang-up about being likeable (based on a lot of life events which in turn caused mistrust). So at the very least, it gives me social proof that someone thinks enough of me that they would want to know more about me at that moment, and they would like to spend some time with me.

We only get so much time. People think time is limitless and invaluable until they have none. Then it's prescious. My thinking is different. I figure well, at least the valued me enough to spend some of their time.

Also, I couple the above with a bit of caution. Not everyone is a good fit for you, friends or otherwise. Dating sure takes an ocean of optimism. The outcome makes it worth it, and controlling the process to a point that you're comfortable with it and you're getting what you want out of it makes it better.

dating,fjbek57,t3_fciqzt,1583191544.0,"Okay, so I read and thought a bit about what you wrote. Here's my perspective:

First, you're doing pretty well in getting someone interested in you, but once they get to know you, they're kind of trailing off. I suspect that you're communicating how serious you are, and you're doing it to a point where it's a little intimidating. As with a lot of these posts I read, I think you may be withholding a bit of the story here.

If you date a few dozen women, and some get close to being serious but not quite, either you're trying to ""give away the farm"" or you're exhibiting some sort of vibe like a Lion going in for the kill. I'm thinking you might be pouring it on too fast too soon.

The key to the beginning of a relationship is seeing a woman interested in you so much that she can't help but think that spending time with you is addictive. All of my long term relationships started this way. 

It's hard to think of when you're so focused on the goal of a relationship, but you need to stay aware of how someone is going to be good for you, not the other way around. My big mistakes were dating women where I knew I didn't want a relationship, but I went in on one anyway - usually because either I wanted to think someone was ""good enough"", or I felt like I should give them a chance, even when I knew better.

You have way more success than a fair percentage of guys I know. But I feel ultimately you're getting in your own way somehow. I would maybe read up on joke writing a bit and watch some stand up. I recommend Jeff Ross, Patton Oswalt, Dave Chappelle, maybe Michelle Wolf too. You need to lead with the laugh. That might be the ingredient you're missing - plenty serious, not enough funny. It's like popcorn without salt. Tastes fine, but it's missing something.

lonely,fivkikd,t3_f9uxdx,1582762135.0,"I want to share something that helped me. I've been wrestling with loneliness for a while, and I have made some conclusions that gave me some comfort.

First, if you are so dissatisfied with your life, then it has to be adapted to be something you can at least be okay with.

Second, realize that you're life is in process. You're working on getting where you want to go. So you deserve to at least feel like you're making an effort, so you can at the very least respect yourself for that.

Third, you're right. Confidence doesn't spring out of nowhere. Confidence is a result. It's a result of daily, incremental efforts and many small wins over time. Which means you develop confidence that new wins will be won. 

""If I got this far, I'm sure I'll be able to go further"".

That's confidence. It grows out of your meeting challenges and being triumphant over them. When you learn something, you don't do it perfectly at first. Virtually no one does. Dating is the same way. You try, adjust, and try again.

Fourth: Ask yourself this question, if you're someone who would make a good partner, why? Are you caring, honest, dutiful? Are you thoughtful? Then these are all benefits that someone would get being with you. Your confidence should grow out of knowing that if you did get into a relationship, you would know how to treat them right. 

Follow me yet?

Lack of confidence to me stems from seeing a challenge or something that you want to change, and forgetting you know how to change it. Your life situation may not be what you want it to be right now, but you're working on it. Most everyone else is too. 

Take comfort knowing you're capable. Then act. Brick by brick, you improve, and you build. And you grow more confident because you know achievement is completely possible, needed, and doable.

There are many times I wanted to beat someone until I saw them choking to death on their own blood. Sometimes people run against the grain of your morality, and it's so egregious, that all you can think of is completely pummeling them. Like, silver-back gorilla type beat-down, just absolute savagery.

But that's obviously illegal. And perpetuates the hate that the World suffers with. And I don't want to perpetuate any cycles of hatred or violence.

So what to do? How do you deal with that kind of sheer rage?

Well, for me I've learned to stop myself, and rank how bad what someone did was. Turns out, a lot of things I fly into a rage over, I calm down fast over. And mainly because I realize that it's not an offense that warrants mauling someone over.

Sometimes, I'm still really angry about it. So I try like hell to figure out a constructive way to deal with the issue. To deal with them. Without fracturing their skull. Our ability to prevent ourselves from being that violent is what separates us from the animal kingdom.

I'd rather be regarded as intelligent, as opposed to striking fear into people. I've known guys that their only way to deal with anger was to act out. Nearly everyone handled them with ""kid gloves"". They didn't relate to anyone. No one sought their opinion on anything. They went avoided, abandoned. And God knows I don't want that.

In fact, I take it as a point of pride that yeah, I have the size and strength that I could go Michael Myers on someone, but I'm **better than that**. So I don't. And haven't. Like, ever. I can honestly say I've never struck a person in anger. And I'm damn proud of that. Because I can use my intellect to solve my problems.

As far as letting off steam, well by the time I'm done weightlifting, I'm too sore/tired to bother anyone, LOL. So maybe some sort of strenuous exercise is in order? Maybe take Martial Arts, which actually teaches you to handle yourself in a disciplined manner.

And as far as dealing with people who make you angry, nothing beats a strongly worded explanation of why you're angry. One that's calm, but is clear as to how mad they made you. Successful conversation will take you very far. 

But the key in all of this is to prioritize your anger. Rank the offense, like courts do with the offenses of people who violate the law. It's a sliding scale, and just like the courts don't sentence everyone to death, well, you shouldn't doom people who cross you to a punishment that doesn't fit the crime.

I'm sure I'm rambling a bit here, but I hope that makes sense. It was actually cathartic for me to write this, as I've had some anger over some things lately. So thanks for inadvertently reminding me of my own advice."
dating,fgiz20z,t3_eyo77k,1580833857.0,"The thing about this is, and others her have reminded me of this, you have to be a little more careful about who you choose to let get to know you better. You have to just search until the person who treats you right presents themselves. And they will prove themselves through actions and not words. 

I didn't think I was very good-looking either until I had my first serious long term relationship. The person you want to be with won't bend over backwards for you, but they *will* make it a point to do things that show how much you mean to them. 

That's what matters. Someone who you have a mutual attraction with, but also an emotional connection. A boyfriend that is worth keeping is one that proves his value without trying. Without knowing much about you, your situation, or the guys you're giving attention to, it seems like you may be going after guys that are all wrong for you."

Not that the opinions of others don't account for something, but for me sometimes they are *everything*. And I absolutely hate it. It's a kind of hell I'm in. 

It's a constant popularity contest in my head. Being talked to, being admired, being asked for my thoughts on something, that's when I feel like I'm worthwhile. I have this constant need to feel like I ""matter"". But when all that falls away (people get busy, times of prolonged isolation), I get insanely depressed. It's just torturous.

However, I don't think that the desire for a solid, loving relationship has gone away. I think more bad actors are enabled, making things harder than they should be. 

I have been exchanging messages with some women, and I have a dinner date Saturday. These people specifically stated they want a relationship in their profiles. We'll see what happens. 

I think the search is what sucks. I feel like it was somehow easier to meet someone and date when I was younger, but then again maybe it was because I was young.

I will say though, this obviously seems like a pattern. Seems like you're seeking out or choosing to get involved with people who share some sort of traits in common. Then it leads to the emotional unavailability. 

Seems like you need to tweak your plan / strategy here. Everyone likes what they like, but maybe you should challenge yourself and try striking up conversations and meeting women who you may have passed on in the past for one reason or another. 

I hope you'll keep an open mind. Naturally you don't have to date someone you don't want to date, but if you have several examples of women who are still attached in some way to another, I think that possibly reflects on you, and you may be subconsciously trying to date women in some effort to prove you're better than the other guy. Bad logic. 

I know I had to make a shift myself, and now I've gone from a ghost town in my inbox to about a half dozen women messaging me at the same time now. A small shift in my search and my focus, and I was able to see a considerable improvement.

""If i lose weight and still can't attract a good looking woman then i wasted my time""

I mean, fuck you right there with that statement. ""I don't want to improve myself if it won't get me some massive self-described reward"".

You're a real jerk. That's why you can't get a girlfriend, much less a good looking one.

Guys who aren't ""conventionally attractive"" get girlfriends all the time. In fact, some guys get stunningly beautiful women. But here's why that is - their attitudes aren't complete shit.

Say I was a hot woman. I just read your post. You know what I would think? I would feel sad for you, because I would know that you are going to spend many, many years angry and alone. Why? Because if a woman isn't super attractive in a societal standard of beauty, she's not worth your time. And that means you don't give a damn about her personality, her hopes, her dreams, her past, what makes her - her. You just want a playmate that is your personal little trophy. Someone that just boosts your warped-ass ego.

A woman wants to kiss you because you care about her. You make her feel valuable. If you're always running around worried about how valuable you feel, then guess what - no one is going to feel like kissing you.

You have zero respect for women. Zero. Did your Mom bend over backwards to pump you up and make you happy? Did she have to be a constant cheerleader just to give you enough self-esteem to get in the shower and wash your hair, armpits, and smelly ass? Seems to me like you've been coddled. Like, a lot.

You don't get to dictate how the World reacts to you. You do however, get to shape yourself into a person that you can be proud of. You're fat. So what? I'm overweight and I've had plenty of girlfriends. And some were as hot as your little ""dream list"". I call it a dream list because you're dreaming if you think that having nothing to offer, and having no pride in yourself, is going to somehow magically land a woman like Sofia Franklyn in your lap.

Here's a thought - why not try to be the kind of man that would land a good-looking girlfriend. Why not try being more compassionate, thoughtful, friendly, helpful, honest, caring, decent. Why not try giving a shit about people's feelings instead of just wanting a good looking woman to have sex with (because ultimately that's all you're consumed with here).

The biggest problem you have is that you have no idea what a good relationship is. You have no baseline. So let me tell it to you, since I've had about 15 girlfriends in my lifetime (frankly I don't keep count), and I'm sure that's not the end of it either: A good relationship is one where two people have things in common, have a similar World view, and are attracted to each other emotionally, not just physically. Love is an emotion, not an action.

Your objectives:

1. Look for someone who likes some of the same things as you, but not everything you like. If you find someone who likes 99% of the things you like, hooray for that, but it will probably get boring and you'll have to mix things up a lot by trying new things. Some differences is okay.
2. WORK ON YOURSELF. No one wants to live in a run-down shack. You need to build yourself up. You need to BE SOMEONE YOU ARE PROUD TO BE. And the ONLY way that's going to happen is if you WORK at it. Life requires WORK. Virtually no one in regular society has put in zero effort and gotten a relationship with a beautiful woman as a result.
3. Change your tune - I mean, this one is huge for you. You need the experience of being with someone who connects with you emotionally. You find that, and you're going to overlook a lot about how they fit into your Men's magazine-soaked scale of hotness. In fact, go find and watch ""Shallow Hal"" with Jack Black and you'll get a REALLY good grasp on what I'm talking about. Because buddy, you have Hal's old attitude in abundance.

Anyway, I hope you let at least some of this sink in, because I'm being very sincere, and yeah it's sad that you've never experienced any emotional (or physical) intimacy so far in your life, but if you change your terrible attitude, and get a better perspective, some time from now, you'll have a girlfriend, and you'll look back on reading what I wrote, and you'll agree with me on just how completely wrong you were. At least you will if you take some advice, and not be so stubborn and hard-headed that you don't allow any changes whatsoever.

What you're doing right now isn't working. Change it in the right ways, and your situation will change."

Your ""formative years""? You have tons of them left! In my 20s, I felt way more alive than I ever did in my teenage years. I felt free. And some of the best times of my entire life to date happened then. 

And now, it's your turn."
lonely,f7i6kie,t3_dw6cl3,1573753742.0,"I always thought this way when I was younger. And now, all these years later, after a bunch of relationships, and several long-term ones, I realize that my mindset was what hindered me. I doomed myself from the start a lot of times because I didn't think very highly of myself. That, and I wanted a relationship so bad that it kind of made me seem like a bit of a loose cannon. 

Do you socialize much? Do you try to get out and meet people? To me, almost 30 is super young. That's great. You have youth on your side. A lot of people have hyper-critical ideas of what they look like too. And I've seen people who look like they climbed out of ooze that got married. So I think there is a lot of information missing here. 

The thing that broke it wide open for me was letting my true personality shine through. I stopped focusing on the fact that I didn't have someone, and focused on how genuinely good I KNEW I was. That worked. 

In fact, the girl I dated in my 20s that was my first long-term relationship is probably my biggest regret. I was stupid, and I dumped her. I've regretted it ever since. She was marriage material. And now in my 40s, I kick myself still over that one. 

So you need to give this some serious thought - what steps are you taking to network, to be there for people, to meet new people? Are there people you kind of know that you could maybe get to know better? You leave a lot out of what you posted. 

Tell me more."
