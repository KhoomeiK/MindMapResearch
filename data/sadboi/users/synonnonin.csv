I don't want to go into details as labels and things popped in my head, but knowing little bits about certain patients histories (I've been in juvenile, as well as adolescent and adult facilities) have been worse than witnessing and then talking the next day to a woman whose arms were bandaged elbow to hands because of what she did the day before. Talking to her not even 24 hrs after that situation where she was smiling and kind of glazing over what she did, in a manner similar to someone who piles dishes in their sink because they went out every night of the week, and then apologizing to me and a few other people for involving us in and making us see what she did. I said it was ok, someone else wanted to be there for her and started talking, and I could see the self injured woman kind of slip back into her mind.

I guess on a slightly more relatable level i can go with middle aged older nurses who seem bitter and for some reason aren't paying attention to how they draw your blood for lithium levels so you end up with bruises (multiple) on your arm and can't bend your elbow without pain for like a week.

I just keep sliding and know I'll never be able to dig my feet it. It was a foresty area, ground cover of leaves, the speed at which I was moving felt like it was increasing as if there was outside force moving me, my speed didn't line up. I wanted to at least hit one of the trees just to be able to come to a stop for a second, and as that thought runs through my mind I immediately go into a free fall off a cliff. That feeling in my stomach comes up and increases to an intense physical surge and everything goes black, my body completely relaxes and I open my eyes to be catching an updraft within a forest canopy soaring up into open sky.

I really thought there are forms that can be absorbed in skin. I mean there are other things that are inefficient, but it's more with large amounts of superpowerful drugs that really only do harm, I'd see reason to regulate them different than just normal scheduling with different seized quantities. when you have something like a brick, or kilo, which may not just be a one time bulk buy, and then using it is a cutting agent or known adulterant for chaos as opposed to stretching your dollar.  (pma) But I can also see an argument as to why bother regulating anything until it happens. My thinking was more about scaling. arresting someone for cocaine cut with synthetic opioids is one thing, but arresting someone with amounts on the level of a brick kinda seems a little different.

Now does money and efficiency really matter when the main purpose is more like a suicide mission? I assume different agencies get involved surrounding different regulations. like I have no reason to buy synthetic opiods, or any opiods for that matter, and so the only reason I can come up with wouldnt be to get high or get other people high, it'd be because it goes through a metal detector and you probably wouldnt need too much to throw in someone's face, similar to falsely selling large quantities with intent to harm/kill rather than make it stronger. But ya why waste it all at once when you can gram it out through underground channels and see how far and long the effects can spread."

When life is that tough the initial process of getting there is really the most difficult part, at least for me. I guess some places do allow phones now? I had cigarette breaks when I was admitted the first times, a while ago. 
I found the ability to solely focus on myself and be around people with similar situations kind of comforting. Decisions are minimal, and you don't even have to leave your room on bad days. But I liked groups, whether I felt like talking a lot or just ignoring everything and not being alone, there is a lot to gain. Plus you get the socks. 

I've found checking myself in to be the best way to stabilize myself, although there may have been a point where hospital stays almost became like a vacation from normal life just to get back on meds...

Visitors are usually allowed, depending on restrictions, and for longer stays you can usually earn privelage to leave for like a weekend. I would assume if all goes well from check in to check out your time may be 10 days or less, (someone else can chime in here...) If you feel you want and need help then go after it, it will help. 

And yes, literally walking into a hospital and saying you are suicidal, or feel unsafe for yourself will start a process of paperwork and waiting for a room to open up. From there sometimes it's a couple hours, other times ive fallen asleep and woken up to be able to have breakfast and get transfered a little while later. This is usually on a gurney, strapped in for an ambulance ride, maybe a wheelchair for on campus, but I know at this point everything is out of my hands and I can just be. You won't get a sedative shot, but if you ever go in manic it's something to look forward to. 

Sometimes you get a roommate, other times you get your own room, sometimes things get changed around. ummm.. Clothes for a couple days, sweatshirts, comfy pants, no ties/string like on hoodies, maybe soap if you have preference but toiletries should be provided. cards, coloring books, small entertainment. Snacks sometimes can be checked or allowed in room. Be well!"

It was kind of a final thing going along with a pH regulated diet but what I have achieved is actually horrendous in the reality of trying to live. Most other forms of liquid consumption don't agree with me. i drink coffee, but need to regulate that and can't just drink it all day. I can drink tea, or self processed juices and smoothies. But most things either destroy my sense of flavor/smell or just outright make me borderline queasy. Some people may think it's healthy, but in reality I can't participate in society. Seriously, there are even certain waters that I can't stomach. Try to incorporate other things, but if you eat and (at least try to) brush your teeth don't worry about it. go to water, maybe lemon water, or carbonated. but don't go to ""soda alternatives"" unless it's really something different.
