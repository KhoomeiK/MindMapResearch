As a woman I wish I didn't have to its quite annoying so don't unless you want to keep doing it every few days. You can clean your razor but running it under the faucet after every few swipes then letting it air dry when done.  Make sure your using a quality razor or you may experience razor burn after.

dogs,fpsk8nk,t3_gf9jzo,1588874877.0,"Lots of good responses here but I pretty much went through the same thing with my 15 year old Pug and by the end she couldn't even walk, was pooping and peeing herself constantly our living room was a complete disaster zone since she was still eating and drinking if we brought it to her. However as it got worse I began to feel it was cruel to keep her going and see her suffer just broke me everyday. I was still young, only 18 when we put her down so it was my moms choice and she wasn't ready. She should have gone weeks earlier, don't let that happen to your dog. Seems like an old dog in a comfortable situation with plenty of food and water will continue to live even if they shouldn't be, which is why so many dogs are put down compared to dying naturally. In my opinion i would rather put them down than wake up one morning and they have passed unexpectedly. Feel better op, hope you'll be okay."

I would monitor him tonight and if there's any swelling, bleeding, drainage, or extreme pain or he's hurting to walk in the morning definitely give them a call asap.

depression,fl4545t,t3_fmejra,1584806102.0,"I feel you because as a woman dealing with smelliness as well I know it definitely kills your confidence and I know its hard to forget what people have said in the past but there has to be more you can do before you give up. If your depression is leading to bad hygiene and bad eating habits, this needs to be addressed before attempting better habits to improve your smell. You have to be motivated to keep up with these suggestions every day. 

I have bad smelling feet and bad BO. Some I think is genetic because my mom has sweaty, smelly feet too and some I blame on anxiety for raising my heart rate and making me sweat when im stressed or worried. They say stress sweat is much more smelly than normal sweat and I definitely agree. 

But anyways here's some tips I've learned from my mom, from myself living in hot Arizona summers, and others along the way:

Scrub every part of your body, from your head to the bottoms of your feet in between your toes. I use super good smelling soaps for my body and unscented for my lady parts. 

Body sprays are good for after showering, and to refresh throughout the day. Perfumes should be used sparingly when going out as too much just makes people look at you like your trying to mask a bad smell. Good smelling body and hand lotions are a nice subtle scent that lasts hours, too. 

Make sure you are using a good laundry detergent, fabric softener if you can, bleach for whites, those smelly beads if you want more good smell. I also use Lysol laundry additive for bacteria works great. For any clothes with bad yellow armpit stains, soak in Oxy for 20 minutes before wash. Dry everything that wont shrink on high and air dry the rest. Don't re-wear clothes and change socks once during the day if you have smelly feet. 

What kind of beauty products are you using? I use Lush T for Toes foot powder and silky underwear powder for my shoes and socks. I sprinkle the powder in my shoes once a day and sometimes in my socks before putting them on. I use good quality shampoo, conditioner,  soaps, body sprays, etc. Nothing super cheap as it never seems to work as good. Lush products are great because its all natural, mostly vegan and never disappointing. 

As for diet, make sure you drink A LOT of water. Buy a big ass water bottle and track how much you are drinking because i guarantee you could be drinking more. Also consider a vegetarian/vegan diet if you havent already. No processed foods, no added sugar, no coffee. Detoxifying teas may help too.

I know this is a lot and I could still go on but i hope it helps.. I absolutely hate smelling bad and hate it even worse when my husband or others point it out. But if i can do it you can too! Best of luck to you and feel free to private dm me if you ever need someone to talk to! :)"
