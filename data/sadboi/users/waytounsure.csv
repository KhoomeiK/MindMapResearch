I agree with you also, we are living in the most peaceful times, it may not seem like it because we can hear and see everything every single person in the civilised world says or does, and people love to be negative (just look at this thread). 

In reality we will certainly face issues in the coming decades, but I think as education grows and as the human race learns how to deal with the insane technology we have access too, things will become better. 

I regularly ask my parents, does this current time feel like the most unsettled your can remember, the answer is always no. They were there throughout the 90s recession, the Cubans missile crises, the Vietnam war, the Falklands, the 3 day working week (we are from the UK) they said now, people just need to get a grip and stop over reacting."
