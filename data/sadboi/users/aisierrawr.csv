schizoaffective,fo0xd6l,t3_g4xun3,1587421558.0,"Now. I decided on my own last december to not take the new meds my doctor prescribed me because after my critical od i thought i had found a new hope to cling to that i wouldnt need the meds. I thought about getting a job in january so taking meds would hinder me from doing that and i just couldnt have it.

I went on and tried looking for a job since january and i thought wow im really fine im actually doing something. 

Fast forward to march and i still had no job i wanted to push through, and one night i accidentally met an old friend who‚Äôs studying to become a doctor. We were catching up and told me how she had someone close to her deal with a mental illness and how she didnt exactly know what to do. So i told her about me and shared some stuff that might help her cope. 

Since shes studying to become a doctor, hearing me say that i stopped taking my meds on my own accord led her to tell me that i shouldnt probably have done that, and that from her perspective‚Äîa med student‚Äîshe emphasized how important it shouldve been for me to take those meds. 

Now im at home spiraling because in a few days i‚Äôll be remembering another ‚Äúi wouldve died‚Äù moment fromtwo years ago. 

Late march when i realized she was right, and i have been majorly overcompensating for months. 

Im in such an ugly state right now and i dont know what to do."

I just posted a photo of our SZA awareness ribbon and didnt say much in the caption last week on world mental health day.

Social interactions exhaust me, mostly because i am not comfortable being around people especially when they dont understand or know about me. I put on a facade that they would like to be around with so it would be easy for them. And even when im with them i am not, like i am wandering in my mind while drowning in their worlds. Even when im just doing groceries or out to pay the bills. It‚Äôs scary when i start to feel like im being watched or talked about or looked funny or followed or whatever. 

So sometimes, i would go out, but just with my cat. We would sit at the park and just watch and enjoy the sun and/or the fresh air and a new view. 

I am trying to do make a change though, i am kind of forcing myself to socialize and/or interact but with reservations. Non-commital stuff. It may sound so selfish but it‚Äôs the most i can do right now, just so i am not always alone at home with my cat. I miss having to talk to real people too, but i‚Äôd like it to be comfortable and safe for me where i wont feel very anxious or panicky.

schizoaffective,ezay5u2,t1_ez9hj5v,1567809612.0,"I actually was thinking about it, but i am worried because about 85% of people i know are Christians, and some are the older ones who are (or might be) way conservative and legalistic. I initially thought that I didn‚Äôt care, that i would just ‚Äúcome out‚Äù to literally everyone, but i guess there‚Äôs a part of me that‚Äôs really scared even though i just want the people to know so i could /stop hiding/ in a way. That im open about it, but i am too scared of how they would respond to them knowing about it. Here there are A LOT of Christians who don‚Äôt agree with MH issues. Some say it‚Äôs the lack of God in their lives or because of not going to church or whatever, and they are adamant about it until you accept that you‚Äôre somehow/in the wrong/ for having it. I just want to be understood from my perspective and not be judged or condemned or something about it."
