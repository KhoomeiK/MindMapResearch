indieheads,fqz5hgm,t1_fqxjjx1,1589760289.0,Yeah makes me a bit sad that Sumney couldn't have come in first instead. Not a fan of the 1975 at all.
buffalobills,fqxsutx,t1_fqwxe42,1589737322.0,Yup. Best friend was killed in a hit and run. Know that feeling.
VinylCollectors,fqt85lu,t1_fqt7o6i,1589632828.0,I can feel that. I recently spent a good amount of money (for me) on a Deaths Dynamic Shroud record on Discogs and it made me feel a little guilty about purchasing it during the pandemic.
VinylCollectors,fqt797n,t3_gktodg,1589632102.0,What's the record you're trying to purchase
indieheads,fqsxxhr,t1_fqsxt19,1589622957.0,Isn't that the one who was raped. Karen maybe is her name? Idk much about the situation since I haven't followed the band before all of this. Might have read something wrong.
indieheads,fqrszxi,t3_gkl733,1589591260.0,Wow this whole situation sounds messed up. Hope the drummer is doing ok at the moment.
indieheads,fqgqav7,t1_fqfke9p,1589353651.0,I just like everything except Slow Rush. The album lacks the great songwriting every other album has and it's really apparent.
indieheads,fq7v7lo,t1_fq67rbu,1589152887.0,Followed by It's not unusual
indieheads,fq7v07h,t1_fq6j4vf,1589152769.0,This would also be my answer. Even after Currents I didn't think TI would ever put out a mediocre album but here we are I guess.
VaporVinyl,fq488zv,t1_fp8dfvd,1589074672.0,This is like the quintessential vaporwave album how do you not know the name of it.
VaporVinyl,fq3n8zo,t3_gda216,1589068114.0,What's the album on the third row to the far right
vinyl,fq3h4p4,t1_fpudibt,1589066395.0,Check YouTube
vinyl,fq3bg2a,t1_fq2l7hr,1589064788.0,"Yeah it's the only album of theirs that I dislike. Everything else they've done is killer though, especially their first 3 albums. The Suburbs is a classic."
China_Flu,fpx0m86,t1_fpwt4nb,1588973413.0,Unless you're Bernie
interestingasfuck,fpmitxg,t3_geagf2,1588734019.0,Wtf is wrong with them. I feel bad for their kid.
indieheads,fpm34sg,t1_fplb62z,1588724594.0,Life ain't always empty apparently
Gamingcirclejerk,fphtqao,t1_fpeq0jl,1588627638.0,Same. It's why I could never call myself one after that whole mess. And than stuff like this only serves to show I made the right decision. It's all just really depressing.
lastofuspart2,fpaf7cm,t1_fp9xgl8,1588446916.0,Don't put politics in my games just means don't put stuff I don't like in games. They don't mean ALL politics but just not those icky trans people. Like I get being upset at bad stuff happening to one's favorite characters in a game but the amount of anger and vitrol right now is kinda hilarious. The game is still coming out and really there was no guarantee for a third one to begin with so I'm still getting what I wanted with being able to play the game. That still makes me happy at least.
indieheads,fp59ex6,t3_gbb6s4,1588320954.0,Is that gumby?
indieheads,fp599pm,t1_fp50x09,1588320805.0,Eh I could listen to Beverly Hills again. Hollywood I've listened to maybe 3 times and that third time is enough for me for forever. Can't stand it.
movies,fozwb85,t1_fozapjh,1588198011.0,People like it and think it's the best because they grew up with. It's not hard to understand. You're looking for something that isn't there.
movies,fozskgy,t1_fozlaco,1588196121.0,Ah yes the moms basement insult. Never seen that before.
PublicFreakout,fougb4z,t1_foug8vv,1588083528.0,With Reddit it's never obvious.
PublicFreakout,foud3zp,t1_fou7rrp,1588081727.0,They are education is shit? What?
indieheads,fos90j5,t1_foqo6fa,1588026168.0,Yeah was a but underwhelmed but if it's a B side that makes sense.
TIHI,fopxl3s,t3_g8o4gj,1587975555.0,I love Ariel Pink
LifeProTips,fonygzh,t1_fonfpfn,1587928960.0,I have a Maine Coon and it's the sweetest thing ever. Not at all difficult to take care of and doesn't do any of the annoying things that most cats do. She's pretty much like a friendly dog that also mostly takes care of itself.
untrustworthypoptarts,fol5t3q,t3_g34es8,1587855451.0,It kinda scares me how many people here think this is real.....
untrustworthypoptarts,fol4x1w,t3_g52808,1587854955.0,An 11 year old could definitely draw this
ChoosingBeggars,fol30ov,t3_g76u4b,1587853887.0,Why did you cross out your own name.....especially when you left it uncensored at the the top. Wtf. Also this is super fake.
untrustworthypoptarts,fol2wvt,t1_foi3yy7,1587853826.0,That's some major dumb-assery there
science,fol1jya,t1_fokzsi3,1587853065.0,Yup I lost a large chunk of ny friends because I pretty much told them about my depression. Made them feel uncomfortable and like I would somehow infect them with my depression if they were associated with me or something.
indieheads,fohbgie,t1_fohadcl,1587763177.0,That's probably my favorite song on the album...that or the opener good kids make bad grownups
indieheads,foh90td,t3_g71kz3,1587762040.0,"If anyone sees this and hasn't ever heard this album before, drop what you're doing and listen to it now."
indieheads,foh8swl,t1_fof9k8s,1587761940.0,Totes. Can't wait to listen to the remastered songs
buffalobills,fodp74b,t1_fodozmw,1587687496.0,Yup. I mean I get why he's doing it. He probably wants that image as a villain for storyline purposes but it's still annoying.
buffalobills,fodp13e,t1_fodoidv,1587687413.0,You bet
buffalobills,fodnryo,t1_fodn1rw,1587686968.0,Before a vaccine gets made a lot of people are going to get it before everything is over.
indieheads,fo8fjco,t3_g69mho,1587595582.0,Never can have enough Ariel
indieheads,fo8enc8,t1_fo75fle,1587595101.0,It's an industrial masterpiece. That and The Fragile.
indieheads,fo8ejrc,t1_fo7cy4k,1587595048.0,Maybe Hesitation Marks. It's the only NIN album I never really go back to.
indieheads,fo8druy,t3_g5zze5,1587594629.0,I like the record a lot but I've also noticed a lot of people getting upset at people who don't dare *gasp* think it's the best thing ever. Feels a little obnoxious to me.
buffalobills,fo3fu4a,t1_fnwpsiz,1587486185.0,Yeah as far as simming goes Madden just doesn't hold up at all. Really even just in the gameplay department as well. The programming for offensive line players is absolutely atrocious.
buffalobills,fo3fn1k,t1_fnxmkrx,1587486090.0,I would argue Madden has been really bad for about 7 to 8 years now. 12 was the last really good one and everything since has been a mess.
breakingbad,fo2xwms,t1_fo2uvdm,1587476630.0,"Not even boring, just a ""tiny bit"" boring."
breakingbad,fo2u9tx,t1_fo2g2jp,1587474244.0,Calm down. It's just a show you'll live I promise you.
aspergers,fo2t7k5,t3_g52f3e,1587473481.0,I would have to have some achievements to feel like an imposter.
madlads,fnuib6h,t1_fntthiu,1587262762.0,Well I've been depressed for a long time so I just don't really care much anymore about propping myself up in my mind. Should I be sharing any of this? Probably not but like I said I don't really care. It's therapy in a way.
SubredditDrama,fntdhf0,t1_fntats7,1587239465.0,It's a bit disturbing how media has the ability to shape people's opinion like that.
madlads,fnsmfnv,t1_fns7enl,1587224602.0,Well I'm absolutely terrible at even basic math so I guess I'm dumb as fuck. Which is true.  That combined with my aspergers makes it so I'm not really good at anything. Yayyyy.
IdiotsInCars,fnnp4qq,t1_fnnb9q3,1587097806.0,You're *
indieheads,fnlrfir,t3_g2ek04,1587058436.0,Not a fan of the song but it might grow on me eventually
videos,fnitwu6,t1_fnhdw9b,1586986292.0,Ok? Still doesn't make Louis CK any less of a terrible person.
videos,fnh52pt,t1_fnh48dz,1586955041.0,Nah sorry. Dudes creepy and it's hard to let go whenever he's brought up. Can't take the guy seriously in any manner at this point.
videos,fnh32eg,t1_fng6n29,1586953533.0,Not sure mr.lock the door and masturbate guy is the right person to listen to morality tips.
WTF,fnh2kya,t1_fngw8z2,1586953151.0,Could easily just have been a typo or auto correction.
arielpink,fnged3a,t1_fjnb06d,1586929659.0,I love his stuff. Especially his more vaporwave -ey earlier music.
AskMen,fnf0y5c,t1_fnf04gd,1586899403.0,"As a Bills fan here's one https://youtu.be/Sh7bVxqpyqE
I can think of a thousand different calls."
AskMen,fney2du,t1_fn379wt,1586897958.0,Well if the refs are still helping out the Patriots every chance they can get still than I could see it for sure.
buffalobills,fneo63x,t1_fnekgs5,1586892852.0,Oh it'll happen every time the Bills get to the playoffs. Fully expected to get screwed by the league in multiple ways during the game and that's exactly what happened.
indieheads,fneeiij,t1_fnee7hh,1586887940.0,My memory was off by 1 number it seems. Should have been a 10.
indieheads,fnct4jq,t1_fnbslc8,1586846339.0,Really bad. The loud clacking sound during the song hurt my ears.
indieheads,fnbr8oh,t1_fnbqrrq,1586820735.0,Try to give Before Today a listen then (the album not the song although that's good as well) changed my life the first time I heard it years and years ago.
indieheads,fnbm1tj,t1_fnasi94,1586817945.0,And on the Voidz album that came out around that same time. He should write for more bands.
indieheads,fnbly2n,t1_fnajjnc,1586817892.0,Is Ariel Pink really that obscure? I would feel like he's at least kinda well known within internet music circles. Fantano gave Pom Pom a 10 so I would think that would do something for his popularity but maybe I'm wrong about that.
indieheads,fnblpn2,t3_g0ikx4,1586817770.0,"Good album but not their best, thats their most recent one."
indieheads,fn4goe5,t1_fn3uays,1586641014.0,Hey I'm a Bernie supporter and I prefer their album before Wide Awake by a big margin.
indieheads,fn4fout,t3_fz985z,1586640436.0,This album basically took over my early 20s and will always place me in that time whenever I listen to it.
politics,fmxogmb,t1_fmxj4tp,1586468818.0,Troll
indieheads,fmxk20u,t1_fmxioy9,1586466456.0,Oh :( well as long as we get a bunch of them
indieheads,fmxds6d,t1_fmwjh9a,1586463104.0,Isn't this all leading up to an album?
indieheads,fmqwwvc,t1_fmqwu17,1586308835.0,Thanks.  I'm  all for more recs. I'll give it a go soon.
indieheads,fmqv073,t1_fm2ck99,1586307644.0,I absolutely love that album. Never realized they were considered math rock but now that I think about it makes total sense.
nextfuckinglevel,fmph5j3,t1_fmoph7f,1586280749.0,Not necessarily. Life is too random and chaotic to ever be to tell where it leads. I never thought I would have the health problems that I have now when I was in my early 20s.
lost,fml0chp,t1_fml07vs,1586175047.0,I would go mad after a week of having to do that.
television,fmj1sat,t1_fmi9dyd,1586121301.0,It's funny you're kinda right but in the wrong way. You're right it doesn't matter he asked because the power dynamics make it so it would never be right for him to do what he did. And I'm sure Louis thinks he's a victim but he's not.
indieheads,fmbpkow,t3_fu94mz,1585930876.0,Oooohhh. Can't wait to hear this.
2healthbars,fm9njxj,t3_fo0w1t,1585872421.0,I forgot Star Citizen was a thing.
PublicFreakout,fm96s83,t1_fm96b9b,1585862794.0,Sounds about right. I've known a lot of shady people in my life that have had one as a pet.
PublicFreakout,fm8xmhd,t1_fm8w8tx,1585857913.0,Insane that people are allowed to have Pits as pets.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fm8rkhe,t1_fm7z0r1,1585854697.0,Well there's community college and then you can transfer. Don't necessarily need to get into one right away.
indieheads,fm5xj24,t1_fm1gext,1585781985.0,Sure they can count. I'll check them out.
arielpink,fm1r4cl,t3_forj1t,1585683502.0,Great record
indieheads,fm1ocil,t1_fm1kyle,1585682072.0,An attempt at trying to expand their sound. Not a good one but there was an attempt lol.
indieheads,fm1dpt1,t1_fm1cy7q,1585676553.0,I think some one else mentioned Tricot as well so they must be interesting. I'll check out all the links. Thanks for the reply.
indieheads,fm1cpgt,t1_fm1cfmt,1585676041.0,Yeah I'll just look at the band names and listen to them on bandcamp or YouTube. I have a subscription to YouTube Music. I'm a weirdo haha.
indieheads,fm1bl02,t1_fm1arm4,1585675469.0,I'll give those a listen. Thanks for the recs.
indieheads,fm1bg0i,t1_fm1avl5,1585675399.0,Wish I used Spotify :/ guess it doesn't matter in this instance if it's on shuffle so I'll give it a go.
indieheads,fm1b9jc,t1_fm1ap65,1585675309.0,That's a good way of putting it.

indieheads,fm1a044,t1_fm19ewx,1585674672.0,I so agree with the 1975 opinion. I remember a bunch of people praising that grunge sounding song they did recently and all I could think of was how it just sounded like a really bad Marylin Manson rip off
indieheads,fm19ovc,t3_fsggye,1585674512.0,Any good Math Rock anybody would want to recommend? I tried listening to that Horse Lords album that came out recently and it just didn't do anything for me.

politics,fm0xl6e,t1_fm0xdt1,1585668150.0,Why do you think that lady from the video is lying. Not saying you're wrong just want to hear your side.
politics,fm0wdam,t1_fm0q2zc,1585667473.0,Wait....you're telling me they actually caught states erasing Bernie votes and switching them to Hillary. And Somehow I haven't heard about this until now. Why hasn't this been talked about more. Wtf.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fm0tfas,t1_fm0t0o5,1585665821.0,Cool beans.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fm0q9m4,t1_fm0pzzn,1585663991.0,How did you get that from my reply lmao. I mean maybe. Judging from every single reply in this thread.
WhitePeopleTwitter,fm0pxap,t1_fm0k3zk,1585663783.0,It's more about empathy for others and not about being scared about how others view you. If you have a good job there's no reason you should be so incredibly insecure about people thinking you don't have money saved up. Just live your life then.
