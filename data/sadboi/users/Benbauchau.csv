Hereâ€™s the description upon which the illustration is based:

""Rusto Wolfsbert is a young man with emerald green eyes. His face covered with a smooth trimmed brown-haired beard, with the chin and mustache grown out a bit longer. His long brown hair is nicely cut. Two long locks of hair fall over his forehead.  
 Wearing a dark purple vest with a silver colored pattern decorating the torso containing equally silver buttons. Beneath his vest, he wears a white blouse, sleeves rolled up and always a button loose at the height of his neck. A big brown belt, with a silver colored buckle keeps his dark grey pants where they should be. Dangling from his belt, you can see a cherrywood light crossbow. On his right leg, attached with leather straps, is a holder with a big combat knife inside, also decorated with cherrywood. His feet are inside two dark brown cuffed boots. Finally, a black cloak with a silver thread decorating the borders hangs over his shoulders.""

characterdrawing,fp29gec,t3_gawx0o,1588257751.0,"Hey!

This is a commission I did a few months ago.

Mo is a Gnomish Kensei Monk from Rook's Town on the High Imperial Road. She is depicted here midway through her quest (along with two idiot knights, Dormren and Matrim) to save the town of Leaffall from attack by a vile hobgoblin horde. She is a priest of Xiaotou, the goddess of Ash, Travel and Death, and follows the Ah-Hum monastic tradition. She convinced a flock of crows to act as scouts and sentries for her and her party by promising them bits of bread and fruit to eat, as well as copious amounts of shiny things. 

You can check out my [Artstation](https://www.artstation.com/benbauchau) or my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/benbauchau/) for more artworks.

Cheers, Ben"
