BPD,fiacgy3,t1_fi8w43p,1582298133.0,thanks!
BPD,fiacggs,t1_fi8z4y0,1582298126.0,"hi! yeah, i lived with my mum and i'm moving out in a few weeks. my dad died in 2011 and was wealthy and i managed to live off the money he had left to me for a pretty long time. also, sounds really bad but i intentionally dated men who i knew had access to opiates and would give them to me, i also took medication from a family friend who was dying of prostate cancer and hadn't taken the medication, i asked his wife for it all and she gave it to me with out full knowledge of the meds or my situation. not proud of it. i've also exchanged sex for money in the past and made money upcycling furniture (lol).

good luck in your recovery!"

BPD,f5i497m,t3_dnrmxp,1572210754.0,"i have both bipolar 1 and bpd and bipolar mania is a lot more than just a mood swing (the sort you see in those with bpd). my manic episodes have lasted up to six months, i've been able to run on about 2-4 hours sleep for weeks on end, i spend money that i don't have, i'm very sexualised and impulsive and tend to start taking a new drug or begin a new career. as you can see, it is a definitely a different flavour of a mood swing/episode compared to a borderline one. hope this helps x"
BPD,f5i396x,t3_dnvy3i,1572210496.0,i'm sorry this person was such a piece of shit towards you jesus christ. i've been through very similar interactions and it really makes me feel like the 'sane' one when i think about some of the things people have said to me.

gameofthrones,eurng9y,t1_eurhrsx,1563996408.0,"to me they just seem like an outsider who was a fan of what they've seen from daenerys who even then realised that season 8 and it's finale was ridiculous, which it was. then the thread goes on to say that emilia clarke is pretty, which she is. i was the same before i watched the show. it's easy to like a character with out watching/reading the entire works that they're in."

CountingOn,er1klv9,t3_c01cnr,1560433096.0,"i imagine they dressed modestly prior to joining the family and that  being ~modest~ would definitely be on the duggar boys' checklist when looking for someone to court. i doubt jim bob and michelle would approve someone who dresses vastly different to them in terms of modesty, kind of like how they wouldn't approve of a man who wasn't established career wise for the girls of the family."
