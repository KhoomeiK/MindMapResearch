FunnyandSad,fqygf83,t1_fqyagve,1589748169.0,Yes! A very important note on that subject is that every woman (every person with bigger boobs) has her own preferences. I don't really find bras in my size that I could afford (and don't look like the ugliest thing I've ever seen) but I prefer to wear a bustier because I don't like that they get sweaty underneath üòÖ there are a million reasons to wear one and a million reasons to don't wear them. Either eat is fine in my opinion.
FunnyandSad,fqyfspb,t1_fqxv219,1589747885.0,That's right but the bra problem is real. There are fewer and less severe marks when wearing a perfectly fitting bra. And they hurt less. A bra that doesn't fit right can hurt like hell
FunnyandSad,fqyfid7,t1_fqxp09v,1589747754.0,"Oh I'm sorry. Now that I read my comment again I see where you're coming from. That's not what I meant at all. 

Of course not every man turns into a drooling troll when they see a woman who doesn't wear a bra under her shirt. I don't know how to convey what I want to say here but unfortunately there are quite a few problems women have to fight that men either don't see or don't want to hear about.

I read a lot in subreddits where more women than men are around (r/AskWomen and r/Two Chromosomes for example) and it's horrendous what experiences are shared there sometimes. The annoyance of bras is one of the lesser problems but still damn annoying.

Generally I think we're on the same page here, I'm just really awkward in trying to discuss things on reddit. Sorry for that! I'm happy that you are still good friends with your ex girlfriend! Have a nice day :)"
FunnyandSad,fqxny7y,t1_fqxkg0q,1589735227.0,"It's not weird at all. Actually it would be good if everyone would accept that it's non of their business what other people wear or don't wear (depending on the situation of course, sweatpants in a professional environment is not okay ofc)

If there are red marks her bra is not the right size. Unfortunately it's way too common that women don't know their real bra size. There are a few standard sizes that are sold widespread and as young women we think we have to fit in these categories and don't know better so we usually buy those sizes without measuring our real sizes. It's actually not that complicated. The scope of the underbust is one part of the size (i.e. 34) and the difference to the scope of the part where the nipples are (widest part of the breast) is the cup size (i.e. C)

I'm not a native English speaker and hope I didn't confuse you with that try of an explanation but generally if your girlfriend has red marks on her back or under her boobs you could give her the tip to google how to measure bra sizes and find more comfortable (and more helpful) bras in the future :)"
FunnyandSad,fqxi744,t1_fqxgazm,1589732677.0,Generally there's mostly no medical need for bras. It's mostly societal pressure to wear them but of course they offer support especially for big breasts to relief the back.
FunnyandSad,fqxhwd6,t1_fqxf9wj,1589732542.0,"Sometimes, mostly for big breasts but generally women are expected to wear bras so their nipples don't show. Which is outrageous honestly.

I don't wear bras (not easily obtainable in my size and budget) but wear bustiers instead (something like a crop top) and people really commented on seeing my nipples before."

- you play with headphones
- when she's planning to take a nap she makes herself comfortable in the bedroom
- she uses ohropax when she wakes up from her couch nap and it's too loud to sleep

There are many more possibilities, that's just what comes to mind. Communication is the key. Most of the time there's a deeper issue behind some problems. You could try to find out together what's bugging her about napping in the bedroom. Or why she thinks it's a totally different scenario when you nap and snore on the couch while she's playing."

Mir hilft die entsprechende Medikation gepaart mit tiefenpsychologisch fundierter Psychotherapie. Ich war vorher in Verhaltenstherapie aber da geht es mehr darum das Verhalten (Peokrastinieren) zu √§ndern, als an den Ursachen daf√ºr zu arbeiten.

Mir hilft auch mit anderen dr√ºber zu sprechen und mein Freund, der mir liebevoll in den Hintern tritt, wenn es nicht klappt. Auch dass meine Therapeutin Bescheid wei√ü, dass ich oft nicht umsetze was ich mir vornehme und dann Schuldgef√ºhle habe hilft - lieber mach ich was als n√§chste Woche erkl√§ren zu m√ºssen WARUM ich es nicht gemacht habe.

Mein Freund sagt immer, es wird nur besser, wenn ich die Sache, die ich machen sollte einfach TUE. Nur durch das aktive Machen kann ich die Anfangsh√ºrde √ºberwinden, aber das hat mich anfangs einfach nur so f√ºhlen lassen als h√§tte er mich angegriffen und inzwischen, mit viel √úbung, hilft es.

F√ºr mich waren die Diagnosen ein Segen. Seitdem bekomme ich von der Krankenkasse bezahlte Hilfe wenn ich sie brauche. Davor habe ich mich einfach nur daf√ºr gehasst, es nicht zu schaffen.

Damit will ich auch nur meinen Senf abgeben. Ich hoffe du findest einen Weg, mit dem es dir besser geht. Wichtig dabei: Es geht h√∂chst wahrscheinlich in kleinen Babyschritten voran."

He has no right to flip out like that. He didn't ask, you didn't tell him - maybe that's because he's not really interested in your stuff? If he doesn't want his artsy fartsy friends to know what you're writing he just could not tell them?
