usyd,ffsy99l,t1_ffswgsm,1580197531.0,wheres that place?? i live in glebe for 4 months and the rent are 850
usyd,ffsy619,t3_ev205u,1580197416.0,"I went through same kind of struggle last year. I lived in a two-level loft with my friends, the rent is 850 per week bills included but I lived with my friend so it’s down to 425 per person. It’s in Glebe, where’s close to the boardway and have a light rail station and bus stop close. I personally think it’s pretty nice, 20-30 mins to uni. Then my friend moved out, so I went to look for my own space. I ended up in iglu, which is 530 per week (it’s overpriced i know) but I think uniloge has rooms for a lower price. 300-400 per week I think? Never inspected that place but u can look it up tho. Hope it helps."

Then one day I was sitting in a park nearby my new house, just listening to music and thinking about what a tough day I had. There’s this one stranger walked by me, and a minute later he went back to me asking “hi I just wanna make sure are you ok? U look really sad I’m kinda worried. If you want you can talk about it” Even thought I didn’t ended up talking to him about my day, but that was the most heartwarming thing someone did to me for a really long time.

BipolarReddit,f6aha9h,t3_dqqu4x,1572756871.0,I’m so sorry for your loss. I think it’s important to maintain your current medication( if you are taking any) and call your doctor. Have someone to talk to and help you get through the hard time. Try not to fall into an episode because of the incident. I honestly don’t have much advice for you but I think keeping yourself together is important. Hope you feel better soon.

Basically u type in the word and meaning, and create a study set. It provides the pronunciation of the word and u can practice writing, memorizing the meaning and pronunciation all in once. It’s pretty useful for me, hope it helps you 2."
sydney,f18ch8g,t3_d82oig,1569255735.0,I’m from hongkong and I live in Sydney. I speak both mandarin and Cantonese. Most Chinese wouldn’t feel offensive or anything bad if foreigners speak Chinese to thank them. At least anyone I know wouldn’t taken it in a bad way. If you feel weird about it maybe explain it in English afterwards? Anyways my friend and I wouldn’t mind. I studied in a Canadian school so in my experience most of the time people ask anything about language the Chinese are willing to help. So go for it! Good luck.
