AmItheAsshole,fqv3rz3,t3_gkyfn9,1589669292.0,I work at a soil testing lab. You can call the makers of the weedicide and ask how long their product stays in the soil and plants. That way you can have an idea of when it's safe to let your pets in the yard (granted that your neighbors stops spraying it everywhere). You could also take plant and soil samples to lab for evidence if you decide to sue for damages though its pretty obvious how your two rabbits died.

I hate the accent from where I'm from (PNW) because it makes some words sound nasally and our slang isn't as widely known.

AskReddit,fpl9sbm,t1_fpl8yml,1588708876.0,Self discipline and understanding it. Sometimes working sucks but if I push through it I can reward myself with a little daydreaming break. There's also grounding techniques that can be used. Feeling textures or just observing things around you to help bring you back to earth helps me
AskReddit,fpl082y,t1_fpkfocs,1588704086.0,Certain therapies for dissociative disorders can help but really it's just a self discipline problem and it takes time to learn how to control it. It's an escape mechanism and with daydreaming it's used to escape the boredom. If the mental work of an office is boring and unchallenging it's of course going to result in wanting to escape. You could work with your boss to get more physical tasks/busy work or more challenging office work. But most of the time you just have to get through your tasks before rewarding yourself with a break
AskReddit,fpkznh1,t1_fpkyc3o,1588703800.0,that's where the maladaptive part comes from. But if you don't want to work and need a place to escape to it can certainly take up 8 hours. I used to pace around my room for hours talking to myself like a maniac before I got it under control
