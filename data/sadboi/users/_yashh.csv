You know Marshall Mathers?
Eminem he battled depression in his early life!
But now he is the goat!

You know Matthew parry?
Chandler bing from Friends, he was depressed while production of the show, he was even into drug abuse!
But he didn't left the show, battled it all!

You know Michel Phelps?
The guy who won total 28 Olympic medals!
23 of which are gold!
He was depressed too, even arrested for substance abuse!
But did he give up??


And there are many more people for example here!!
I ain't saying these people are truly happy today!
All I am saying is there is something waiting for all of us!

Only the darkest night gives the brightest sunrise!

And one more thing! Even when you realized there is no hope, just hold on to that hope for a little longer!  
The light will come!


Do good deeds! 

And love yourself!

We all love you!!"
depression,fb9s5f2,t3_ec6fn2,1576647871.0,"You know dear, some time you have to let go something even if it hurts to let go!!


Let me give you hope here!!
No matter how bad it gets there is always best to come!

I've been through all of this you are experiencing and I tell you! It don't let forever! 


You seem as broken as glass, so the best thing for you is to be alone so you don't hurt anyone else.
Just for sometime, you have to fix yourself first 
So be alone for sometime! And give that time to better yourself!! Learn something new, maybe learn to draw, or write or anything. Stay close to art! Because that a superior way of expressing then crying and tell people you're hurt!

""put that pain on a page and take that page to the stage and blow the roof of the place!""
-The script!


And yeah listen good music!
What you are feeling is just a phase dear it'll go away!

.


We all love you!!"

depression,fb1idvs,t3_eaqn2p,1576437366.0,"Anxiety is difficult to fight but there are somethings you can do to get over it in an easier way!

1. Everyday take some time out to note down the things and situation that gave you a panic attack in a journal. As the days will pass you'll start to notice a pattern and from there its easier  break that pattern  by  recognising the things  and situations you have to stay away from and avoiding them.


2. You mentioned music in your post, and man it does really help! I can't stress it enough! Listen to good music. If possible learn a musical instrument. Or you can even try rapping! Like putting all you feel on a beat is so therapeutic! Write about yourself or anything you find good enough to write about! But the whole point of this is stay closer to music it'll help you in the long run!


3. Work out! Exercise man! Cause it lowers the stress hormones levels!! And you'll feel more confident and good about yourself!

4. Practice meditation! It will help you get more control over your mind, so when your thoughts tend to drift away to the darker side you can pull them back! You can go on YouTube about meditation or use an app like Headspace. It'll help!

5. And always know there are people who love you!!
We all do!! 

Stay strong homie!
 
Hope you'll feel better!"
