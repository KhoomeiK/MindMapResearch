The family dynamics and sometimes the team‚Äôs dynamics are the biggest challenge. The patient care is rewarding and challenging. You will develop fantastic relationships with clients and families. I‚Äôm in a very small community in rural Ontario and I run into my clients all the time. It can be awkward but always fun to bring them into my own life a bit (my bf or kids are often with me so they get to meet them also sometimes). 
I worked I patient psych in a major centre for 13 years. Straight nights. This was the best career move I could have made. As stated, your car will take a beating, so will your bladder but it‚Äôs worth every minute.

I have been refused entry to a pharmacy (to pick up patient supplies) and a grocery store (not in scrubs - but they know I‚Äôm a nurse because I shopped their all the time prior to this outbreak on workdays in scrubs). The paranoia is real. 
On a side note I have also had some wonderful experiences also. I try to hold onto those. Fortunately there is a second gas station that is open and keeping a very clean washroom. They know be by name by now and welcome me when I come in."

It was a violent relationship. As unbelievable as it sounds it ended when he tried to kill me after I broke up with him. He spent some time is jail. I have had to deal with that trauma my entire life. It has destroyed multiple relationships. I met someone about 2 years ago after ending a long (and dysfunctional) marriage. 
This relationship did something different. We communicated. About everything. I was honest with him about everything, including my trauma and what had happened and my aversions and fears relation to sex. He listened and he responded with kindness. We have gotten more and more comfortable and started exploring some kinks. We haven‚Äôt defended into full BDSM territory but I have discovered I like being dominated. Told what to do or what‚Äôs being done to me. I like to be fucked hard and aggressively. The diffeerence. CONSENT. He always looks for it and he always checks in during and after. He ALWAYS looks after my needs also. I had not experienced orgasm outside of masterbate in ever. Now I get two or three each time. 
Communication and trust are the key. If you feel safe you can explore some of our darker and kinkier side. 
Best of luck.
