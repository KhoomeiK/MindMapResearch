You would have to accept there was something morally wrong with the entire GOP to ignore all that's wrong with the trump administration(starting at the top).  Since all of them can't be sociopathic the only logical conclusion is they want a clown show to distract the public.

Somehow the foam surround for the tire well in my car wasn't seated properly(its 2 pieces) and would make that squeaky foam on foam sound constantly.
