AskReddit,fr5fb44,t1_fr4ppcd,1589907620.0,I once hopped in the back of my friends pick up truck to scare him once he got in. He didn't notice at all cause he blasted his music real quick. So he started driving and I decided I need to get off. Decided to jump off the truck while it was leaving the parking lot. I said shit no going back now as I jumped off a moving vehicle. Fell and rolled on to the road. It was an action movie moment for me. My friend never even noticed.

I got so mad at them for that, because the leaves were so clearly from the ground near their garage. They didn't even check my lights right either, they said all were working and I knew my rear brake light was out. Never went back their again. Just happy they did the oil change right."

I work in a deli and we have regulars still forget their face and name even though I was told it many times. Just can't think properly sometimes, and I find myself blankly staring at something for who knows how long....but the episode is almost over and I have no idea what's going on...rewind...blank out
