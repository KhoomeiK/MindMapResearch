BipolarReddit,fg0gxdz,t3_ew6tcp,1580407570.0,I enjoy drinking but sometimes I don't know when to stop. I've gone into really intense and dangerous manic episodes by doing so. If I'm in a depression I tend to drink more because it makes me feel alive.

I know it's a stressful situation for all of us here. My other cats are fine and all get along great with no behavioral issues. She was fine until maybe a week and a half ago. 

I'm planning on moving out January-February. Just a few financial humps to get over before I can. 

I honestly just wanted her to be loved and happy and it hurts me that she may not feel that way at the moment. I know that once I move I can give her all the space she needs, I just don't know how to make her feel comfortable again for the time being."

bipolar,f6m3let,t1_f6m13w6,1572966088.0,"I agree. Im not the type of person can lie and be secretive bc my face and my attitude says it all. As soon as I saw it I messaged him and told him I saw the comment and I was upset. As I said before, I happened to come across his account on accident the last time I even looked. That was two months ago. When I feel insecure and I start having intrusive thoughts I literally don't know how to operate. I'm in therapy and medicated and I've gotten better but seeing him call me crazy upsets me."
bipolar,f6m0dh2,t1_f6lz5ut,1572964617.0,"I told him. The only reason I even found out his username is bc I was browsing another sub and saw a post by him. I don't even get on Reddit everyday. If I feel like for my own peace of mind that if I need to look when I get a certain feeling, then so be it. I'm with him bc I want to believe things can be better. I don't believe most of what he says bc he has literally torn me, my self esteem, my trust. I'm trying hard. We talked and he said he was sorry and now sees that it was disrespectful and hurtful to me after all we've discussed regarding that word. I don't like it and he knows it triggers me. Regardless, I will do what I need to do for myself to feel okay. Things have gotten better. And before, I had only looked at his Reddit when I saw the post. I haven't again until yesterday. I know I'm not all together but he knows how I am and I know how he is after this long.

Sidenote- I also wasn't using it as an excuse. But it is an explanations as to why I feel the way I do at times."
bipolar,f6lr7kv,t1_f6kr9km,1572958323.0,I am very much like you during mania. I confronted him and we talked. He said he understands that it was disrespectful now and is very sorry. Idk.

Anything I've ever said or posted about him has been for advice or a vent based off of real situations. He had always used my illness against me when it's convenient and that's the real issue here.
bipolar,f6lqydq,t1_f6ky3r4,1572958075.0,He told me he was joking but he has zero emotional intelligence or respect for me not just based off of this post. But it tells me alot.
bipolar,f6lqv82,t1_f6l608p,1572957989.0,"The only reason I looked is because when I'm manic, the wheels start turning and I can't have these paranoid ideas.

It's tough and it shows so much strength that you are still pushing on and keeping your kids at the heart of that. They'd be devastated if they lost you, even if you have felt like you have only made things worse for them. It's not true. My mom wrote that she was sorry and that she only made my life worse. She also told me to not let it destroy me. It did for a long time, and I'll never be that bubbly, confident girl I was when she was there to remind me of who I was. But i am rebuilding myself to be better. I hope that you continue to keep on going and remember that your kids need you no matter what! Sending you love."

ptsd,f2tcmth,t3_dds9lb,1570393260.0,"Hey there. I can relate alot to you. My mother was alcoholic and from 6 years old up I have very vivid memories of visiting her in hospitals and wondering where she went. She was also bipolar so I never really knew which mom I would get on any given day. When I was 16, I got home from school and found her in her bed, foaming at the mouth, barely breathing. I had to call 911 and watch my little brother try to give her CPR. It was an extremely traumatic experience. I have had terrible flashbacks of this event. She died in the hospital brain dead the next morning. I didn't go see her. And I regret bc my brain has convinced me that she's not dead. I told her I love her over the phone and heard the flatline. Afterwards, I had to move in with my barely there father and his 23 year old girlfriend who treated me like trash. My brother was sent to live with grandparents. My father has always resented me because I look so much like my mother and act alot like her as well. It hurts because I'm not her. I'm sorry you're going through this. I was diagnosed bipolar, PTSD, and severe anxiety in May. It's been a journey. I wish you the best and hope you get the help you seek.

And no, it isn't your fault."
