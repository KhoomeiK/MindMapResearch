A workforce that's mostly made up of undocumented people, who are among the most vulnerable members of our society because of how easy it is for their labor to be exploited. 
 
>Days often begin in the middle of the night — say, 3 a.m. — to leave enough time to get to a pickup point (a parking lot or vacant lot), be picked up (or not — the labor contractors who collect workers and deliver them to farms generally don’t take all of them), and get trucked to the worksite. Each crop is different; you’re stooping to pick (fruits like strawberries) or cut (vegetables like broccoli) essentially nonstop, usually with pressure to keep up with a truck that’s collecting the harvested produce. If you fall behind, you could get kicked out and lose both a day’s wages and a ride home. Conditions vary, of course, but there are often very limited breaks.
>“It’s not just the physical stress,” says Salvador. “It’s the psychological stress. You have to keep up, you can’t afford to lose this job.”

/
>And the pay? Between $10 and $12 an hour, generally. Sometimes a bit more, sometimes less. But, because there isn’t year-round work, according to Salvador, “these families are earning $10,000 a year.”

Seeing a trauma specialist helped me out a lot, and I was able to convince myself into going by telling myself ""even if I wasn't sexually abused I still need to figure out why I have so many issues that are usually associated with sexual abuse"". This helped a lot with overcoming the weird feelings of guilt that I had at first for wanting to talk about this, because I felt like I'd just be wasting my therapist's time. Dissociating during the abuse can also make it a lot harder to remember, for me making myself numb and mentally detaching myself from what was happening was the only way I was able to get through it.
