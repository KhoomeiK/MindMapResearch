My family doesn’t believe in my diagnosis and they think i’m faking it which makes it 20x harder to believe in myself and it also makes me feel like a fraud. Thank you for reminding me to celebrate the small victories, i need that!"

ferrets,fopc94q,t1_fopc1jt,1587957915.0,thank you! i have spot cleaned him a few times. He just gets super stinky super fast so an oatmeal bath sounds like my best option

BipolarReddit,fnpdf99,t1_fnokl6k,1587143556.0,"I went up rather rapidly. I started on 100mg which did give me wonky side effects because i didn’t weigh much at the time. It wasn’t working so my dr just put me on 300mg. 

this was mentioned earlier but it helps me keep a routine. I take it an hour before bed and stopped fighting the sleep. 

depending on the person, it can make you drowsy so that might be causing the zombie feeling"
BipolarReddit,fnni6cg,t3_g2tevi,1587092934.0,"im on 300mg and also hallucinated when i fought sleep. Almost every time i did, i would end up in a sleep paralysis state having the worst nightmares. i’ve been on the 300mg for 5 months and thankfully this doesn’t happen anymore so there’s light at the end of the tunnel (:"

bipolar,fm91jex,t1_fm8940m,1585859965.0,i used to drink a lot and use drugs periodically. My Dr told me i was alcohol dependent and i was only making myself worse. I didn’t wanna listen but i wanted to be healthy. i’ve lost a lot of friends along the way but i feel much better and more stable.

BipolarReddit,fleqivp,t3_fod815,1585089500.0,I have an extremely healthy diet and i’m pretty active. Once i was put on seroquel i gained 35 pounds like it was nothing.

bipolar,fkoecjp,t1_fkoe291,1584385519.0,I’ve been trying to gain a little bit of weight but not 35 pounds. my doc told me if i started to gain too much she’d put me on something else but my last visit she totally ignored my request. Ill probably stop taking it too
BipolarReddit,fkod9en,t3_fjp0b1,1584384895.0,i had suspicions but was scared to get diagnosed. 2 of my coworkers are bipolar and noticed i was living off coffee and i hadn’t slept in days. They sat down with me and told me something was wrong with me and i needed help

cats,fj181lk,t1_fj17fc5,1582914654.0,"i started cleaning it with just soap and water but i felt that wasn’t going to help the smell. I also have a ferret so i use his clean cage spray ( which is supposed to neutralize odors). 

It’s neither poop nor pee, it’s the litter it’s self. The only thing you can smell throughout the whole house is litter."
