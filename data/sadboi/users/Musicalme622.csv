I would continue to monitor for COVID symptoms, even though she tested negative, and has no fever, because of the 10/10 headache and her other symptoms. That headache to me, was in some ways worse than my chronic MIGRAINES!"

I'm sorry to say your ""friends"" and ""families"" reactions are those of envious people. You've been given some great tactful responses to use when this happens in the future. Please, enjoy your ring! It was given in love. You shouldn't feel bad because other people are rude, and envy you. Please enjoy your engagement, it should be a time of happiness.
