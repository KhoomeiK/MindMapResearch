If you‚Äôre looking for more intensive therapy, I‚Äôd recommend looking for a DBT skills class in your area. DBT is a style of therapy that focuses on coping skills that you can use in your day to day life. In a DBT skills class they‚Äôll teach you the skills and help you practice them so that you can use them outside of therapy. I think that might be a better investment than doing individual therapy more than once a week.

I have tried rTMS. I think it helped but I also changed my meds and my life in general around the same time that I did rTMS so it‚Äôs hard to know for sure. Be warned though that rTMS doesn‚Äôt work immediately, it‚Äôll probably take a while for you to notice an improvement."
