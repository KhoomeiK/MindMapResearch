depression,evf4jpz,t1_evcx0e7,1564488361.0,"I know! Because normal people wonâ€™t have such experience, through out years of observation, I forgive them for unable to understand the pain within depression. I came up with a coping mechanism which is acting like a ridiculous outcast. 
People might regard me as an indifference or lazy person, the truth is I can only hidden those symptoms as theyâ€™re part of my personality, therefore, others wonâ€™t notice when Iâ€™m having an emotional breakdown or in another depressive episode. 

I tried to force myself to think positive, I failed miserably. And then I talked to myself  â€œfine , if you want to criticize yourself, you can only use nouns. â€œ
Then again, all I could think of was trash, failure, loser, etc.  

I always assume others have the worst intention because I canâ€™t afford any form of hope. Either they really care or it is just common courtesy, I donâ€™t think they can understand, just like I canâ€™t understand how they can live on meaningless life so happily and satisfyingly."
