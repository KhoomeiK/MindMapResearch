The people that you see waving the battle flag are the same poor saps that would have been the poor white farmer scratching out a living away from the big plantations, one of the poor mountain men or some other lower class working stiff. I've talked with some of these flag waving people, and they have this dream that they are a part of the heritage of the Southern Gentleman, and it's only a dream. If they truly bothered to trace that family tree back, they would find that the family never had that big plantation, wealth or power. These people are an example I pointed to when Reality Television became popular. They want to try to escape their life by latching onto someone else's, and in the view of these people, the storybook life of the Southern Gentry fills that need quite well."

At the most basic form, it is a blower with an electric circuit that changes the pressure that the motor outputs to a designated level. The devices that have a step down for higher pressures so that the person can exhale are a little more complicated. Due to this heightened expectation of 100% fail safe use, the single stage devices, CPAPs, start around $300 dollars and the dual stage, BiPAPs, start around $1000, and go easily into several thousand dollars each when you start adding features such as humidifiers, IoT connections, and creature comforts like heated hoses.

I find it ridiculous that only certified technicians can get their hands on the manuals in a legal way. I've found the manuals through other means, and have had to modify levels on my own. It's a very easy thing to do. Most devices either have a hidden button or you hold a certain button sequence when the device is plugged in to get to the menu, then just set the needed therapy levels. When I was first diagnosed with Sleep Apnea, I didn't have insurance, and luckily had access to a used machine that just happened to ""Fall out of the Dumpster"". It had quite a few hours on the motor, so the medical equipment supplier decided to trash it rather than pay for the re-manufacturing on it, since the ROI was lower than selling a new machine. That machine lasted for at least another 2 years, only getting replaced because I got a job that had a good insurance package, so I finally got new replacement. I passed it on to another person in a difficult spot, and set the levels for them before kicking it out the door to them."

electronic_cigarette,fkdrvbb,t1_fkcnj5r,1584092269.0,"To clarify the point you are grasping for, is that cellular damage is occuring in a smoker's body. Exposure to the chemicals in the smoke cause mutations, that when they stack up, can cause a multitude of outcomes, ranging from Cancer to outright cellular death. 

Of course a smoker will have a more severe reaction to a invading pathogen, just as someone who is immuno-compromised, because to an extent, there are some of the same features at work. With the cells of the body being degraded or mutated, the response to the invading pathogen is muted or non-existant, due to the body allocating white blood cells to fighting off inflamation or cell damage from the smoking. Thus, the pathogen is able to establish a foothold, and begin multiplying and infect the body.

A strong reason why advocates of vaping state it is a safer alternative to smoking, is due to the only reactive chemical in the current make up of vape juice that could be harmful in a high enough dosage, is Nicotine. Both Propylene Glycol and Vegetable Glycerin have been utilized and found safe for human consumption for many years now.

A point that I considered when switching over to vaping, was the inhalation of vaporized PG/VG. Now, as with then, there were some folks that were nay saying, because we didn't have hard facts about how the human body would react. I acknoldge that there are no studies, but historic evidence works just as well. All we have to do is consider music concerts and other events where a fog machine is utilized. The so called ""Fog Juice"" is a combination of propylene glycol, triethylene glycol, or glycerin, that is then cut with deionized water. This liquid is loaded into the machine, then vaporized, being released into the air, to the desired concentration. Some people will experience irritation, but that is a small percentage of the general populace. I strongly believe that if Vaping is killed off due to the inhalation of vaporized PG/VG, then use of fog machines should follow shortly after, based off utilizing the same chemicals/techniques."

There was one dude that was always coming to my section trying to chat up one of the ladies. I don't know if anything happened between them, and i honestly wouldn't have cared. I had a job, did it, and went home."
talesfromtechsupport,exkju71,t1_exke2fa,1566391695.0,"I used to work at a TV Station back in 08, and was there when master control used the old style system that ran off tape, then switched over to full digital computer system. I bet that most stations and broadcaster centers have switched over by now to the full digital systems, and would guess if you ran into a situation where the same episode of a program ran continuously, then it's either a naming issue or a bug with the broadcast software.

An easy way to envision the broadcast software, is to think of a media player like VLC or WMP, but this one has features kind of like a day planner to set appointments. You set up what date/time you want a event/program to broadcast, tell the program where the program is parked on a hard drive, then set commercial breaks and where the media for those commercials is on the hard drive.

When it comes time for the show, and everything is set up right, it goes off without a hitch, and the master control operator just watches, checking off entries on the hard copy of the event log to show it all went right.

Of course, this is the simplistic version, because I wasn't a Master Control Operator, I was a Traffic Assistant. What I did, was to schedule out the commercials for all of our channels, and make sure that the media was on site for Master Control."

I know that you can see it on many different channels now, or even see it on Youtube.

I love that they decided that the employees were worth more to them then the revenue of the programming that they canceled to broadcast the event."

I know of one from personal experience, [ProMedica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProMedica) is a healthcare company that will  instantly reject you even if on cessation drugs to kick the habit. I applied for a job as a security guard, and came across the standard screening package of questions. One of them bluntly asked if you used tobacco, ecigs or nicotine cessations products eg. Nicotine gum or patches. I answered truthful, and received an instant rejection."
sca,etu2jea,t3_cd9rn7,1563202655.0,"So, as a ex-fighter from Ansteorra who used great sword primarily, take what I say with that grain of salt, and check with kingdom rule book to meet specs. I learned to fight from a small merc chapter of a household.

He advised on length, to cut it a couple inches taller than yourself. At 5'7"", mine came out roughtly 5'9"". As for handle, I put it roughly 2 1/2 hands in armor up from the end.

As for the other questions, I can't help there. However, one piece of advice I was given, I'll share. Shields are pain in the ass to get around, but they can also be your friend. Just as they hide behind the shield, you can hide behind it as well, you just use the painted side. I loved to side step into the blind spot when it would get hairy, and take that second to breath, then get back into the dance. One other technique that we drilled was what he called a fish hook. You fall back, pinging the tip off what you can, then hook hard either left or right to try and off balance the opponent, and create an opening. Probably a well know thing, but was new to me at one point, so yeah, point it out just in case.

Good luck and have fun."
electronic_cigarette,eqhhyve,t3_bygal7,1560059578.0,"Honestly, you are way out of the warranty period at 6 months, even if there was one to begin with. You have 2 options here, charge with an external charger, or pony up and buy a new something. One option going forward if you want to continue USB charging, is something I'm in the process of experimenting with. I purchased a USB cable with a magnetic tip [Amazon Link for example](https://www.amazon.com/NetDot-Upgraded-Charging-Indicator-Compatible/dp/B06XVRBTXK/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=magnetic+usb+cable&qid=1560059102&s=electronics&sr=1-4). This isn't the one I got, but something similar. 

The body of my Voopoo Drag is beat to hell, but the usb port looks decent, the port still feels decently tight. I know that it makes life a little easier since with the magnet, I just have to get the tip close and it pops into place, and pulls apart if I forget and grab my vape and walk away with no issue. Of course YMMV, not affiliated, yada yada, just saying what I'm experimenting with."
videos,eq1xmqy,t3_bwzyn9,1559722364.0,"I wonder if the mayor's beliefs stem from religious beliefs. Dollars to doughnuts, he is Catholic. A theory that I've put together, is that way back, when the church was first getting it's ducks in a row, they needed to grow their head count. The way to grow that head count, is make sure that your followers are making kids as fast as possible, so outlaw the love where babies aren't made. 

I could be wrong, it could have stemmed from societal standards that were already in place, an aversion to how the Romans did things, or something else entirely. I just don't like how some people will point to a belief and declare that others who don't believe or act how they were told to, can justify destroying those different viewed people."
videos,epgz6m1,t3_bupnq0,1559220283.0,"I was working in TV here in the States when we pulled the plug on analog TV. The day it happened, several of us were pulled from our regular duties and even had overtime scheduled to man the phones. If I remember right, we had run commercials on our own dime, explaining that it was happening, and even had the news cover the switch over morning, noon, 6pm and 10pm. Do you think it kept people from calling to bitch? OH HELL NAH. We got everything from 20 year olds up to old grey hairs calling and screaming. The US had a program to get the cost of a digital converter box comped for any citizen, but it was to much trouble for some folks to call the number and get the coupon. It was damn annoying, let me tell you."
