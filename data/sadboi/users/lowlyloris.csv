For a long time he would attempt to physically intervene in these meltdowns and that only made them worse. However, now he is able to help me to come down from a melt down by reducing volume and light decreasing sensory stimuli and waiting quietly for me to be able to interact again. On the rare occasion when he does feel it’s necessary to intervene so that I don’t hurt myself, he has now learned better tools for doing so."

A little while ago I started using CBD for my depression. It’s too soon to say for sure how it’s working but I think I’ve noticed less depression and maybe even fewer meltdowns? Therapy didn’t really work for me, because I have trouble connecting with the therapist. No matter what you do, I don’t think it’s easy. Even neuro typical people seem to have difficulty with friendship. I mask pretty well so I can start off on the right foot but I can’t keep it up.

While I understand the instinct to compare your pain to hers, I think it’s important to remember that trauma doesn’t care who went through the “worst thing”.
PTSD doesn’t say “I only attach to people who have nearly died and not the people who found/resuscitated/ cared for them”
People like to move on from tragedy as quickly as possible, because it’s uncomfortable, but that often leaves those involved alone to cope with the very real pain that remains.
If you have any friends who you just haven’t been pushing the issue with, because they’re avoidant, but who you feel close enough with to risk it I’d try.
I’ve been suicidal and something that’s helped us being really candid with at least one person who cares- even if they don’t know what to do.
Don’t avoid the details to spare other people. If you’re remembering something specific it’s better to come out with it than to gloss over it. Better for you.
Processing trauma can be a lengthy process and it’s not just “this event happened”, it’s “ these were the sights. These the smells. These the thoughts. The feelings. The little events within the event.”
I hope that made sense"
