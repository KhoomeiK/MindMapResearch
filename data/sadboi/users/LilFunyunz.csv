No one can tell you something that will make you instantly better. No one is struggling here because they haven't heard the magic words that unlock the neurotypical DLC in their brain. It isn't our lot in life. It will ultimately come down to learning a skill or set of skills that you have to practice and then apply to achieve a higher quality of life. Antidepressants Help, but they aren't a one stop solution either. It's generally a multi faceted approach.

BPD,fmw4y01,t3_fxm4t2,1586439626.0,"This will be brief relative to what it could be, but i hope to lend a little hope to you.

I was just out of an 8 year relationship. Suicidal, but not wanting to die. I wanted to find help. I sought out therapy and within a month my therapist was confident enough in her assessment to diagnose me with bpd. It seemed to fit me very well. This was a year and a half ago. 

I remember how much it helped me just to know and understand that there WAS something going on with me. It felt so validating to see that my struggle was not in my head. It had been so horrible feeling day after day like you are just like everyone else and you just suck at existing and managing your emotions and life way worse than they do. 

That was a key component to my recovery. The acceptance was easy. I wanted to be able to reconcile why most everyone I saw was getting along in life fine and I was struggling to go to work each day.

My therapist challenged my beliefs about emotions. And I learned strategies to deal with the bpd. 

**This is the single most important part of managing bpd day to day in my opinion with my knowledge and experience:**

I used to believe that there was no way to influence the response that your head manifests for you emotionally when you encounter a stimulus.

Ex.) bad driver cuts you off - - >> ANGER

this was my experience with life since I was a boy. I never knew anything different.

But with practice you can drive a wedge between the stimulus and the reaction. Not in the sense that you don't respond emotionally at all, but rather that you can slow it down and self talk about what is happening.  being able to do that is extremely important to my day to day management of bpd. It takes practice and it won't work well at first but it's like training muscles. Neurons that fire together wire together. You do it enough and it gets easier and in some situations it may become automatic. Like muscle memory.

While I worked on this ""emotional training"" for lack of a better word, I also worked on negative self talk.

Nuerons that wire together, fire together. I constantly have to listen for bad talk in my inner monologue and talk it back when it happens. Again, this takes effort and practice but becomes easier with time.

Both of these are what I do to help manage my bpd along with an antidepressant.

Finally, take all the above strategies and pair them with the understanding that sometimes the ball starts rolling downhill and you are spending a BUNCH of energy on trying to stop it because you know thats an unreasonable thing to be this mad about or this sad about. Hell, maybe you don't what it's about and you just want it to stop... But rather than spend that energy there, try to be mindful of the nature of the emotional response and let it do its thing. It will burn itself out and you don't have to stop it, you just have a responsibility to be aware of it. 

I've had success with just telling myself that I'm really upset or really depressed and idky and that's OKAY because I have bpd, it happens. this will pass with time. I tell my current gf that I'm upset and idky but I'll be okay soon.

This is the brief snapshot of recovery for me.

Im different. Thats okay. Im worthy of love and care. Practice reaction management. Practice self talk. Know when you are losing a battle controlling an emotion and cognitively step aside from it. Imagine my conscious self literally moving out of the way of the emotion as it tumbles down hill out of control. I choose to let it go and do its thing while remaining centered.
