BPD,fp4coiy,t1_fp3gfi8,1588296239.0,"There is a deeper issue in your case, and you will find it has a common thread among all your actions.

I'll tell you what it is. It's a common one. You feel worthless.

1. You feel worthless because you are not pretty enough.
2. You feel worthless because you feel you are not worth being replied to.
3. You feel worthless, so you have low self-worth, and therefore low self-confidence.
4. You feel worthless, so you feel you have to emotionally manipulate (most likely subconsciously) instead of simply explain what you need. 

You need to convince yourself that you are not worthless. Talk to an enlightened witness-- someone who has faith in you to help explain why you aren't worthless. Once you have that initial spark, take some time to yourself to look over yourself and see if the believes you have about yourself are true or not."
BPD,fp4c3ag,t3_gazy08,1588295892.0,"Your getting close to a person, in this case, was not BPD. It seems that you actually both got close to each other.

The BPD part of it seems to have come out when you sort of relied upon him emotionally and felt destabilized when he needed to take him for himself."
BPD,fp2ibpl,t3_gaxao1,1588262247.0,"While BPD is involved in this behavior, it is not the reason why you are acting this way. BPD is the reason you have a meltdown in reaction to a pretty friend, or make rash decisions. It is not the reason for the pain in the first place.

After (or even while) emotionally parenting yourself, you can identify these shadow messages and sources of pain. For example, you feel upset because someone else is pretty. Maybe someone was cruel to you and told you that you were not pretty. Maybe you have an underlying self-confidence issue. Whatever it is, you need to investigate it and see if it is true or not. More than likely, the negative things that you think about yourself are not true."
BPD,fo8u4yy,t3_g6c7tj,1587603890.0,"No, you are not making it up. It actually happened. Your father is denying it out of shame or out of admitting his criminal intent. The other members of your family are denying it as a common psychological defense mechanism to trick oneself into believing that their family is safe."

BPD,fnn4hsp,t3_g267jl,1587084224.0,"I am one of those people who learn and apply further from sharing my learnings with others (hence my username). I enjoy coming on this subreddit, because helping others as well as myself gives me a sense of satisfaction.

However, I do agree with OP that there are times that posts get overwhelming especially when I am in a lot of pain. These moments are few and far in between, but when they do occur, I like to take a step back and self soothe, and think in a wise fashion about my particular situation.

I return to the sub to seek advice if I cannot resolve issues on my own."

BPD,fnj7mvd,t3_g1u1qb,1586993505.0,"Hey, I am in the exact same situation as you now. As weird as this may sound, it is reassuring that other people are in the same boat as me, and I look forward to working (maybe together) to rebuild our lives.

I have BPD and am (or was) in a relationship with someone with BPD traits. Unfortunately, the relationship was codependent and rife with abuse. My abuse was more blatant, whereas his abuse was more subtle and harder to detect. I know that he is a good person at heart, but I realized we needed some time apart to heal. This realization took some time and a good amount of pain. Sometimes I still feel that pain. I was in your position a few months ago, posting the same on this forum.

I understand how you feel. It is hard to come to terms with the fact that the person you thought was for you may actually not be compatible. People with BPD really value habit and stability and look for those traits in others. When these people leave, we are not able to cope easily. Our emotional minds harken back to our inner child-- and we feel helpless, perhaps as we did when we were children.

However, we can apply a few DBT strategies here that will help:

* **Self-soothing:** When you are in this much pain and feeling this magnitude of emotion, it becomes very hard to think clearly. Take some time to clear your mind and do a healthy activity that soothes you. It could be taking a shower, making a cup of coffee, walking your dog, or doing household chores. It could be more hobby oriented: talking to friends, playing video games, art projects, or home improvement projects, or reading a book. Take your mind off of the current situation until you have calmed down. 
* **Emotional mind versus wise mind**: Our emotional mind tells us that we are helpless and that we cannot live without another person who is important to us. Our wise mind tells us that there are people we hold near and dear, and we like to cherish the moments that these people are in our lives. However, people are people, not static entities. People change-- they grow or regress, and their attachments to us change along with that. To some extent, we try to be flexible and change with them to accommodate them. However, there is a line where the changes that we are required to make are too great and too hurtful to accommodate the other individual. At this point, you will feel that pain. You will feel like you cannot eat or sleep. You will feel physical pain, and find it hard to breathe, because of anxiety. Perhaps you may do what I did and project your pain back onto the other person. You want to force them out of desperation to be who they were before, but now, you are doing to them what they did to you.
* **Radical Acceptance:** It is important for us to accept situations in which we have no control. If we somehow did gain control, it was gained in an abusive and unethical fashion, and we must relinquish it:

Repeat after me: 

*I understand and accept that my partner and I are drifting apart. I know I have done all I can to try and bring us together, but it is up to him if he chooses to leave. I am not happy about it, and I will be very sad if he chooses to step out of my life. I will cherish the love that we had for each other, and the memories we made. I will learn from the mistakes that we made and apply what I learned to future relationships. I will always care about him, and he certainly changed my life, but I need to care about my life.*

*I understand and accept that my partner leaving does not play a role in my self-esteem. I work on myself by going to therapy. There are many people in my life who value me, the most important of those is myself. It makes me sad that my partner is choosing to go his own way, but I will continue to better myself, for my own sake. Perhaps, in the future, there will be people who enter my life and appreciate the qualities I exude.*

Please remember that your partner does not want you to do anything. You want to do something because you want to keep things stable. However, you can also accomplish that goal by accepting that your partner has to leave, that you can be stable on your own, and that your self worth is not tied to your partner.

BPD,fnhwvyu,t3_g1ubhg,1586970203.0,"I would say that the first thing you need to do is isolate yourself for a little bit. Before going into a place, or meeting with someone work out a go-to plan that you can use to excuse yourself from the situation.

Walking away should help calm you down a little, and afford you a little purchase to apply your DBT skills of radical acceptance and self-soothing. When you are good, you can either leave the situation or reintroduce yourself as the situation warrants.

Worst case, you will blow up in an isolated area, like your car, after which point you can compose yourself and then move forward."
BPD,fng9woh,t3_g1cytt,1586926030.0,"What I realized is that, if I care about this person, I want them to get better. I am not helping them get better, so I will back away and work on myself. And they will work on themselves.

And maybe one day we will both be okay and can be family. Not romantic, but family."
