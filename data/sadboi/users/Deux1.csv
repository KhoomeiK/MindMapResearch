Check the overflow pipe from the main water tank in the attic, if there is one. This pipe is usually located somewhere under the eaves of the house. If there is water flowing this usually means the ball cock in the attic on the inflow is faulty and needs to be replaced or repaired.

Check around the house for leaking taps and toilet cisterns. To check if a toilet cistern is leaking you can add 2 or 3 drops of food colouring to the water in the cistern. Wait 15-30 minutes. If the water in the bowl changes colour the cistern is leaking and needs to be repaired.An alternative method to check if a toilet cistern is leaking is to place a sheet of toilet paper on the inside back wall of the toilet.

2. Add you the number of nozzles to get the total flow rate for the pump + 10% margin
3. Calculate the total pump head i.e. static head + dynamic head + required nozzle outlet pressure
4. Once you have the total design head required and flow rate, then pick a pump that has a suitable pump curve and plot the resistance system curve. Where the two curves intersect will be the actual operating point of the pump. It should be within the recommended operating range for that pump.

Your pump will be submersed in a tank of water so total discharge static head will be from the pump outlet to the nozzle outlet. Deduct any available suction static head to get total static lift required. The dynamic head is basically the friction pressure drop from the pump outlet to the farthest nozzle, so that includes tubing, fittings, filters and the pressure drop of the nozzle itself.....+10%.

If you are going to change out the system at some stage, then go primary/secondary. Up to you.

Plumbing,fqhkuyr,t1_fqhc2o3,1589379025.0,"If you go to page 19 on the link, there's a schematic of typical zoned installation you should follow for the boiler make. Couple of things to note.

1. No need for hydronic separation with this boiler so i'm assuming the boiler burner is modulating and doesn't require a constant flow rate. The boiler is low resistance as non-condensing tend to but just be aware that back end protection is integral with these boilers so the return water temperature should not be allowed to go below 125F during operation. If you plan on using outdoor reset, you need to watch this and design against it.
2. If your rads have lockshield valves installed, you don't need a dedicated balancing valve for each rad. Might want to check that.
3. Any reason why you are not using low temp rads with Heat Pump or Condensing Boiler? Just curious

Plumbing,fqh3bak,t3_gimu5d,1589366362.0,"Couple of clarifications required, if you don't mind:

1. I'm assuming the hydraulic separator you're using is a hydro separator as you have no air separator or dirt separator shown. Is that correct?
2. Is that secondary pump constant speed? If it is, you may need a max DP bypass valve or change it to variable speed
3. Are all those zone loads sized for the same flow/return temperature
4. What type of boiler is it? condensing or non condensing? High resistance or low resistance?
5. Why the mix of piping spec? Copper to PEX would be the norm.
6. Put purging valves on the returns, where you have the zone valves and move the zone valves to the supply side
7. Why all the circuit balancing valves? What are you serving? Rads, Baseboards?
8. Keep the main supply/return headers short, fat and all the same size. Size for 2-4 ft/sec with all zones on to minimize pressure drop."

HVAC,fqgvpc6,t1_fqg9ptu,1589358759.0,"If you want heating and cooling/dehumidification then go with a gas central furnace with two stage A/C. Your winter temps don't favor heating with an air source heat pump unless you have a back-up heating source. I have worked on Geothermal radiant heating systems with integrated cooling but that was in the UK on a commercial project. Fantastic set-up if it's designed and installed by a competent consultant and contractor. Expensive set up though and the contractor really has to know his shit. I have no experience with jet system so can't comment but i'd say the blowers and ducting on those systems would be more expensive due to higher External Static Pressure.
