AskReddit,fpui0vw,t3_gffps6,1588913416.0,"This is REALLY tame compared to a lot of the stuff here.

I have multiple instances of being accused of doing something when I didn’t.

As a child, I was accused of stealing a check and was yelled at about it as soon as I woke up. I went to school distraught and worried that once I got home I’d be beaten by my mother. 

Later on my mother said she “never said” anything about beating me and found the check later on. I was around 12/13. I still don’t know understand why she would blatantly lie but whatever.

Another instance, I’m an adult and it’s just me and my parents.
Somehow my father’s most expensive pen broke.
I didn’t really go through his things nor did I poke around. I was just starting college and trying to work so I don’t have much time to do that.

Nonetheless since I was an only person there other than my parents, I was accused of lying a breaking a pen which I didn’t even touch. I kept saying that and they would not let it go.

They kept badgering me and guilting me so I even falsely admitted it so they would leave me alone. And even despite that they kept guilting me.

It was like no matter what I’d say they’d still harass me about it.
 I had to literally cry and beg for them to stop mentioning it that night.

I don’t know what got into them to make such a big deal about a pen."

AsianParentStories,fodsq2m,t3_g6qwq4,1587689421.0,"My mother used to say similar things. And she would actually look through my phone if I left it out when I was a kid. At that point, I didn’t discuss much of my problems with people nor did I engage in drinking or sex lol so I didn’t have much to hide but the idea that she just had to look irked me. So without telling her I put a passcode on my phone and laptops for the last decade or so. She would comment here and there about why I would lock my devices and honestly I’d just dismiss her comments and say that they mine so why does it matter. Eventually she learned that I didn’t care about what she said so she shut up indefinitely about it.

Same reasoning behind locking my door and turning off my location when they tried to track me. At first I was scared to tell the truth but when I had a chance I just honestly said it was creepy for them to track me.

At first it didn’t seem an issue but then my mother with all her hysterical and over controlling behavior would look at my location and freak out. I think I was in the vicinity of a planned parenthood in Santa Monica (they literally have that clinic so close to the shopping area/parking lot lol so I mean if inaccurate it’ll look like I’m there) and she kept obsessively calling me. It’s overwhelming and feels like I’m in an abusive relationship lol.

That’s what’s kind messed up about this ya know. Cause you hear the type of behaviors that your parents do in people who’ve described abusive relationships with their SO. But obviously I’ve encountered some people saying this is just normal “strict” parenting. It’s one thing to be vigilant but it’s another to be trying to control a person and invade their privacy.

Until a major life even happened (not a death but something that hurt my father) and he was consistently in a bad/depressed mood and turns out he himself had depression and well after a few years he’s still on medication.

To be honest, I don’t   forgive my parents for acting that way. They usually invalidate me on more than one occasion. Nowadays, the seem to understand after what my dad went through. However, forgiveness etc isn’t the point I’m trying to make.

I guess what I’m trying to explain is that some people will be pretty ignorant unless happens it to them. Furthermore, in general, I feel like adults are quick to be dismissive or maybe certain adults like yours and mine. It’s obvious that for awhile they devalued my opinion since I’m younger than them.

I learned to keep my mouth shut because obviously they were prone to consistently keep saying dismissive things to me and that hurt even worse. Now I’m afraid to even tell my health professional wondering if she’ll believe me. I know it’s difficult and family support is always needed but at the same time, try to rely on trusted sources or vent on here!

Honestly, the best thing you can do is try your best to not engage. In my family, I slowly realized that people really don't give a damn when it comes to what they say or do.

As a result, when my parents decided to move to California (Another side of the country from my hometown where my grandparents are), I leaped at the opportunity. My parents aren't stellar but not dealing with constant ridicule from grandparents is a consolation prize I'll take lol.

AmItheAsshole,fmcbpcv,t3_fueetx,1585942617.0,"NTA - (but also maybe a little bit of the AH here lemme explain) I posted something similar to this which reminds me I should reply to it lol. 

I’ve grown tired of the constant text messages and video calls. I’ve even grown tired talking to my boyfriend. It’s not that I do not like these people or don’t want to see them but it’s so exhausting. And plus I’m an essential worker. 

Talking to customers and working 8-9 hour shifts practically alone and also dealing with the occasional unpleasant reaction from a customer is overwhelming. Then I gotta go home and engage in empty conversations when I already feel depressed and depleted about shit is something I don’t want to do. 

In my case, I don’t want to complain or seem ungrateful for actually having people check in on me. Someone on my original post commented how they never have anyone want to speak to them which was me a long time ago.. I didn’t have any friends that gave a shit. So in that way, it’s kind of an AH move to ignore friends which I am guilty of too.

But all in all, it’s a lot to deal with it really is. I personally cannot explain my exhaustion with talking to people I know. But I think if you need a break take one but don’t completely ignore them too much which is what I’ve been doing.

Believe me I really wish I could take a full on break. I am so tired of people and working and possibly being exposed and on top of that, toxic household and I can’t reveal how I feel or will be crucified by my family.

Overall my message is take care of yourself but also try not to ignore people for an extensive amount of time because I don’t know if there was a time in your life but in mine there was a time no one gave a shit.

Which as someone mentioned all passes wouldn’t look as good as all A’s even if this is a special situation grad school is pretty tough to get into..
 
EDIT: to clarify my school specifically discouraged major required classes as P/F and even just requirements for grad school that may not be apart of your direct major could screw you over if you take it P/F.

What made me feel bad is cause this time I know this joke wasn’t technically a personal attack but at the same time I was just talking to her and she just kept mocking my sentences and such. I just felt so irritated over that. Majority of the time she jokes and I do feel bothered but I don’t say much

Then they went to the extreme (saying “they” cause my father joined in) that they won’t joke at all with me anymore or speak to me... like that’s not the issue... 

If I express my emotion or concern I admit certain times they are accepting but when it comes to this I always get the “I’m too sensitive line” that’s why I’m so confused if I’m even right or wrong or worth being alive like I just have no idea what to do anymore.

I apologize all the time and now that’s invalid since I still get bothered by jokes sometimes anyways despite apologizing for being “too sensitive”. 

My mother literally got mad at me a few weeks ago for not hearing her over the sink. So mad to the point where she wouldn’t speak to me... how is that not “too sensitive”. I’d rather not use their arguments since I rather not get more blow back


I’m so tired of this I’m so tired of being in this household. It’s not like I don’t admit my wrongs. I probably shouldn’t be so annoyed to be at home or have mood swings but even when I admit my hypocrisy it isn’t good enough.

In this case, OP’s friends said they were an AH so OP probably felt bad after getting opinions from close friends and wanted outside perspectives. 

Not saying there aren’t attention seekers on here but honestly some people may feel guiltier about a situation after it happens or if someone else says they’re the AH. As a result, they may wonder if they’re in the wrong... so I completely understand where you’re coming from but not everyone is an attention seeker that’s just my opinion though obviously who knows what anyone’s intentions are but some people legitimately overthink and gotta ask on here and that’s the tone I get from most of the posts anyways"

OP, honestly just re-evaluate your thoughts. You're an adult who has a child and obviously this child should be able to look up to you and here you are making assumptions based on their race and where they shopped, if they even went to China maybe you probably don't even know for sure lmao.

But as you mentioned here I have hesitated and I honestly rather not do that. I don’t really defend either the cutting off of parents or children tbh. 

I think if someone feels as if they think possibly their health would be better off without them then maybe that could be the better option. However I think obviously trying to find an alternative solution such as a middle ground without going to that extent is beneficial.

Anyhow I’m my case I think I may keep my distance to avoid conflict but yeah either way it is tough to decide which is why I’m guessing a lot of people ask here and on reddit in general. 

All in all it’s tough to decide really but I personally think in either situation, if a post like this is on this thread again, that definitely people should think it through before commenting “cut them off”. But it really is dependent on the situation itself as well."

Furthermore, the fact that he said “get over it” from what you’re describing is obvious that he has issues lol. He is invalidating your feelings. Grief is a complex process. Not everyone goes through the same thing and even if you were “over it” who cares it’s your phone why is he so insecure over a damn background.
