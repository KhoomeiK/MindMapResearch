AskReddit,f5s5is2,t3_doo4lx,1572412700.0,"If video counts, there's a video of a Georgian luger dying right before the 2010 Olympics during a training run. He flew off the track and crashed into a pole. Pretty sure the video was shown on the news with a warning before it and I was told to leave the room (by my parents) since I was 9 at the time. But I ended up seeing it when I was like 15, not sure how that happened.

I think the reason it was so bad was knowing it's real. I wouldn't even blink if it were in a movie. But knowing I just watched the last moments of someone's life definitely made me lose some sleep. It's also why I'll never watch luge or bobsledding live."

Advice,f5jh7ii,t3_do15hu,1572228452.0,"At this point, I'd say cut him off. Threatening suicide like that is actually an abuse tactic and in general, a really fucked up thing to do--no matter how much you're struggling mentally. Being depressed or suicidal doesn't make anyone an inherently abusive person, and people sometimes blame stuff like depression to avoid accountability. I certainly sympathize with anyone who struggles with suicidal thoughts, I do as well. But I can't really bring myself to sympathize with people who use it as an excuse to destroy someone the way he seems to be doing with you. What he's doing isn't okay at all, and it isn't your responsibility to take his abuse."

mentalillness,f5ih28b,t3_dnxumn,1572214352.0,"So I can't give super specific advice since I have too intense a hospital phobia to risk institutionalization, even when I maybe should have. But given what I've learned from friends' experiences, you'll probably only be in there for around 3 days? May vary based on where you are, but that seems pretty average if it's something like medication reactions. 

Seems someone beat me to this suggestion, but definitely communicate with your professors. You don't have to go into detail, just say you'll be in the hospital or dealing with a personal emergency. Something like that.

As for your husband being apprehensive? It may just be his concerns about what we're often shown of mental hospitals. While my hospital phobia does have some basis in life events, I know the use of hospitals in horror has fed into it and definitely made it worse. This could be what's happening in your husband's mind on a smaller scale. Try communicating with him about what your stay would likely involve, and make sure that you both communicate with each other clearly. That's helped to dispel anxiety around hard situations in my experience. 

Whatever happens, and however people react, make sure you're safe and do what you think is right. If you think you need to go to the hospital, do it. Worry about your safety and well-being first, basically. Hope this helped, and good luck!"
