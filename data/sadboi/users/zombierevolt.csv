ShieldAndroidTV,f8tsi6s,t3_e25vgd,1574810287.0,"There are back up type apps app that might work. And most likely even more for rooted.
However I would not recommend using them. It's always better to do fresh installs. Most Google apps will sync up and give you most of the same settings. Things like Kodi, it's always recommended to start fresh.
You will be happier with the outcome with fresh installs of everything. You will have have a lot less issues.
Just my opinion from my experience."

As soon as Kodi load everything (almost 900 movies) I'll give up the steps I've done."
tinyMediaManager,f2nleye,t1_f2ncvos,1570317357.0,Not really. Registering at kyradb.com and using your api and user api with tiny media manager works well and you can choose different ones if they are available.
kodi,f2mttrq,t1_f2m567h,1570308639.0,"First make sure you have the animated posters gif in your movies folder. I use Tiny Media Manager.

kodi,f0uawk3,t3_d68kww,1568937112.0,"I have found that just deleting the .nfo file works best when you want Kodi to scape all info and it gives you the media info.
However, you will have to go through your media and make sure the titles are correct. A few of my did scape the wrong info. But just do a refresh on that movie or show and choose the correct one.

This might seem a bit silly. But it beats having to refresh everything one at a time for internet info and art."
