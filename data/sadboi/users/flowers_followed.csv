In 2006 my gallbladder was so bad I was going to the ER twice a week for six months. I had no clue what was wrong with me. I thought I was dying. No insurance and minimum wage so the ER was my only option. 

They never once gave me an ultrasound, only copious amounts of x-rays. They would give me something they called a ""gastric cocktail,"" a shot of Demerol, then send me out the door. About four months in I was deemed a ""frequent flyer,"" the term for drug seekers in the ER. They stopped giving Demerol shots (I hated them anyway, they made me ill but I thought it might take the edge off) thinking I would stop coming in. Well I didn't stop but nothing changed. 

I finally gave up and went to see my cousin who is a doctor (but won't see family for some reason) and I begged him to help me. I ended up in emergency gall bladder surgery that day, in the same hospital. When they wheeled me through the ER I stared those judgey bitches down. I was jaundiced. I stayed in the hospital for two weeks with a tube draining 6 months worth of bile out of me. I was actually vomiting bile toward the end, I even told the ER staff I was vomiting green liquid that had no business being in there. But hey, I now have a 20,000 dollar medical debt that will never go away to remember it by (all those x-rays)."

That being said, I typically like my Walmart job. I've had much worse and been paid much less for more back breaking work. Am I thrilled to go in an hour early this morning because they habitually understaff? Hell no. I wasn't happy to give up my off days because so many are calling out either.

Then I met my now SO. My nex didn't want anything to do with the children but suddenly he wanted to be involved. I should have known. My oldest claimed my SO, the man that raised him in place of the sperm donor, sexually abused him. It was a fiasco. They interviewed my other children, one of which is my SOs bio son, and asked questions that broke my heart and infuriated me. Questions a child should never have to answer unless there is real danger.

My SO stuck with me, incredibly, until it was all thrown out. His lawyer told him to leave me just to be safe. I'm so glad he didn't. Now my boys are adults and life is peaceful. 

I understand it's a horrible situation, more than most. I understand the reaction because it can destroy your life.

I removed azami's buff, placed my debuff back, then 35% phys resist buff on my my team as I rotated them back in. I had two solid turns to do damage before rotating back out.

AnotherEdenGlobal,fq5qrx6,t3_ggyssp,1589114853.0,"I've had the same experience with support but with another issue, light/dark farming. I understand that it's all rng based, I understand there will be dry spells. Close to launch I began farming Aldo's light. One month went by and no light for him despite running miglance as many times (hard and very hard) as possible throughout the weeks leading up to a month. Not even one light.

I report this to support, they ""investigate."" They also wanted exact dates and times of runs which is crazy and I told them any time everyday for a solid month until I ran out of key cards. I don't keep track of exact times I run a dungeon and why should I be required to when asking for help? That's a shitton of runs, I'm not keeping a memo pad with exact dates and times of each dungeon I do. But for posterity's sake it would be a wise thing to do for every person that plays in case you run into issues.

They said there are no bugs, the game is working as intended, nothing they could do. So I just stopped running for light points and starting using my cards for something useful. I've had the same issue with Amy and Azami. Azami FINALLY started getting points just last week after running her for every present garulea since it came out. Makes me think that maybe the bug is fixed and I should try Aldo/Amy now.

As you can imagine my light/dark points are pitiful. I have three slots in garulea and I'm very happy to have that much. Now that maybe the bug is fixed I can actually open four. Support doesn't give a shit, even if you pay here and there for Chrono. Found this out the hard way. Hopefully someday you will run and see an option to buy back your missing grasta.

AgingParents,fq57vm0,t3_ggvuc4,1589095444.0,"First, take a deep breath. This is actually very typical in a lot of cultures and even our own years ago, in the past families usually cared for their aging parents in home. It's worked for centuries and so it will work for you if you are willing to put in the effort and it seems you are. 

Now you MUST involve a lawyer. I'm not at this point with my parents yet so others could point you in a better direction as to which type but with all the legal odds and ends you'll have to bite the bullet and get one involved. Maybe your father already has a lawyer, if so it would be really good to touch base and if nothing else discuss the situation at least. It will definitely take some of the burden and ease your mind to an extent to get with a lawyer.

As for the rest, it's good to play second fiddle to your father's lead. The very worst for older adults is losing freedom and autonomy. It seems like you're doing well here, you're stepping back to see what he can and can't do. You're letting him do as much for himself as possible. Even if it seems like he doesn't, he does very much appreciate this. 

If you ever find yourself extremely frustrated and overwhelmed, just think for a moment about how it must be for him. Neither of you wanted this situation and sometimes older adults can make it worse by bucking up and being contrary. It's so very hard for them to accept that this is their new reality. He doesn't want to impose on you and your life. The frustration from that alone is enough to cause some major issues all around.

The best course is to just keep at it like you are now. Give him as much space as possible. You all need to settle in and become comfortable in each other's constant presence for now. After an adjustment period, if things go smoothly, you'll find it gets easier and he may be ready to find hobbies and things to take up his spare time himself. 

In college I had a few focused classes on the aged and how the Boomer generation is going to change how we approach older adults. They're nothing like generations past, they helped create the world as we know it today. Sitting on the porch and watching the world go by isn't going to be enough. 

I also suggest getting maybe a laptop specifically for him and programming it in a such a way he can re-learn or familiarize himself again with technology. He may get a few viruses and get frustrated but this may also help alleviate some of his stress. Going from being connected to totally unplugged doesn't feel good for anyone, older folks included."

I sometimes dote on them and say things like this because I know I'm not their parent but I'm proud of them in that same way. I need to start being more sensitive to this. Some of these kids came up rough and are really making a go of it. One of my work boys is going into basic in a few days. I can't help but look at how far he's come and be so happy for and proud of him. I try and hope that I don't overstep my bounds in my happiness for them all.

truechildfree,fpv9ux0,t3_gfpys4,1588939537.0,"I have kids, and I've decided today to join this sub for the purposes of what you're asking here. Dealing with kids and getting used to working around them takes time and practice. Parents have the advantage of years of brain training against kids interruption. I was doing 30 page college papers while caring for/watching my three boys at the same time. It can get annoying but it is also workable.

Parents have this air about them that kids read easily. They can tell when adults who deal with children are busy, it's that ""I'm watching you out of the corner of my eye but I'm busy so no interaction right now"" air. She is drawn to you because you don't have it, I can say that without a doubt. A good thing to do here would be find an interesting ball/rubics cube/puzzle/glow wand or some such toy at a discount store (dollar tree here where I am). When she approaches you again, lay it to her straight. I have work to do. I have this nice toy/thing that I will let you play with if you sit quietly and I can work. If not you must go back and be with your parent.

When she doesn't sit quietly, take this child back to her parent. Tell the parent you need to do some work and she is distracting you. If it were my child I would be mortified and control the situation. Some do not though so you must be firm. When she doesn't sit quietly, take her away from your area and tell her no, you must work. If she continues coming back then you must ignore her/not engage. This will take time, it won't work in one go so don't be discouraged. After a couple times of removing her from the situation and her ignoring you and coming back, you must act like you're ignoring her even if that is impossible for you. Do not engage, no eye contact even.

If she tantrums or does dramatic things to get your attention, don't fall for it unless she could hurt herself then you get the parent. At some point if she is prone to acting out and throwing tantrums the situation will be taken out of your hands because it will become a mass distraction and not just your problem.

I'm writing this in haste before work so I apologize if this has been repeated or already said to you. The whole key is standing firm and not caving unless absolutely necessary. Once she sees and understands you ignoring her like other adults who are busy, she will lay off.

Edit to add, the way you treat her isn't going to undo the way her parents are raising her. Don't worry about making her feel unseen and unspecial. I'm sure she's drawn to you for a host of reasons but that you engage her thinking about your own upbringing probably plays a part. Kids are very intuitive. She already knows you care. As for the rest, it's not your responsibility to fulfill her emotional needs and this situation likely won't last long enough for you to make a big difference in her life. If she is three, she likely won't remember this anyway. Don't feel bad for getting your work done."
