Add to that the stats concentration, and I see no reason why you couldn't start as a data analyst making $50k+ and climbing the ladder over the the years.  A lot of jobs view a masters about the same as a few years of industry experience, so you need to keep in mind the opportunity cost.

Higher temperature wants to turn materials into liquids, high pressure wants to turn materials back into solids.  Think of it as a battle.  In the mantle, pressure wins, and keeps the material (mostly) solid, then in the outer core, temperature wins and it's molten.  Then, in the inner core, even though the temperature is even higher, pressure wins again and turns it into a solid.The inner core and outer core are mostly the same composition - iron and nickel, whereas the mantle is mostly periodotite, it's just the trade off between pressure and temperature that causes the difference (for the most part).  Fun fact: as the Earth's interior slowly cools, the inner core is getting bigger as more of the outer core solidifies.  Some people think that there was no inner core up until (relatively) recently when the temperature dropped low enough for material to solidify at the very center of the Earth."

statistics,fppa4r0,t1_fpp8hzs,1588798590.0,"I did IT in undergrad and for a bit after school while I looked for full time employment, and let me tell you, those recruiters saw that experience and it was like moths to a lamp for $12/hour service desk positions.  I've been out of IT for longer than I've been in it, so I'm hoping it doesn't claw me back - it really is a graveyard of the hopes and dreams of STEM people who thought they'd do it just for a bit while looking for something else. I'll take biostats over IT any day of the week, just don't think I'm very qualified for it."
TooAfraidToAsk,fpp0ue0,t3_geibdf,1588793998.0,"I'm a guy at it bothers me too.  I like to think that I don't do any of what those posts accuse men of, but it still makes me feel like trash.  ""if it doesn't apply to you it shouldn't bother you"" is complete horseshit, try using that to defend saying something misogynist or racists and see how far that gets you.  Honestly though, the people posting those kinds of things usually have miserable lives, and I just take a moment to be thankful I'm not a miserable sniveling wreck like they are.  I also unfriend/unfollow them if it becomes too much, don't really want to see posts telling me how much of a piece of shit I am because of my gender."
statistics,fpoi03e,t3_gehyty,1588784830.0,"When you fit a model like this, the idea is that you're fitting a model to the data in the observed ranges.  You can't predict the future because that is out of the range for which the model was fit.  This is one of the cardinal rules of regression they'll pound into your head over and over.  To model this you want to use time series analysis, it models the autocorrelation between points over time and uses it to make predictions.  Although here, TSA is also unlikely to give meaningful predictions here because of the small number of points with which to fit the model.  I'm not super familiar with intervention analysis, but I'd point you in that direction for modelling this as well"

personalfinance,fpnqgjh,t1_fpnowf9,1588770312.0,"Well no, but if my US stock portion was 10% QQQ and 90% one of those funds, I've still slightly outperformed just having one of those funds alone. But I see your point - staying in QQQ is betting that I think it's going to continue to outperform the market, and the whole point of indexing is so that I don't have to worry who's doing what."
personalfinance,fpnn2tu,t1_fpnja0m,1588767887.0,"Not quite.  If we compare the percent growth over 5 years of VTSAX, it's 31%, VFIAX is 36%, compared to QQQ, which was 100% over the same time frame, QQQ has clearly outperformed the market.  All of these percent growths would've been even higher had it not been for the recent crash.  While I don't want to bet the farm on it, my logic in adding QQQ is to boost growth a bit over just a broad market."
