BPD,fp39rly,t3_gaoaxf,1588275563.0,"THANK YOU!!! I'm so tired of people thinking that's normal for us and just a ""oops I have bpd"" moment. I understand we WITHOUT MEANING TO can hurt people and sometimes we have meltdowns and say things in the spur of the moment but we, like you said, are absolutely responsible for our actions. We need to hold ourselves accountable. I saw a post on here saying that a symptom of bpd was them wanting to make people fall in love with them just for the hell of it and that is so gross to me that they acted like it was okay bc it was ""part of bpd"". It's not part of bpd and yes maybe their other symptoms had something to do with it but uh not okay, not cool, work on stopping that. If we have a habit of hurting people, we need to work on not. You can't just give up and be like oops my bpd"

But it does come off as ignorant, and some people really are just ignorant. I get annoyed when I hear it, but seriously they aren't completely wrong. If you don't fight the negative thoughts, you aren't giving yourself a chance. Sometimes there are moments where the positives really can't be seen, but it's worth a shot."

He gets onto me about how I'm not working hard enough on myself but I've been going to therapy since I was 15 (almost 21 now), been going to doctors, reading up on as much as I can to understand myself and cope with things, etc. Him? He does nothing more than working on himself on his own. Which I give him total props for because he's done really well when it comes to his anxiety. But his moods and ptsd? He can't do it on his own and he won't accept it. I really believe he's bipolar (his mom is also bipolar and he uses it against her so he gets offended if I calmly try to suggest that). I think things are going to get to a point where he gets worse, we both can't handle anymore, we break up, he'll see me as the reason why, but hopefully while we are apart he will have an epiphany and get better. I can't expect him to come back to me after that though. I hope this all doesn't happen and we can just make progress but rn this is what I see"
BPD,fh4jp93,t1_fh3tetn,1581279367.0,"Oh definitely, it means a lot to me that he has stayed with me this long. Because while I'm not the most severe borderline and I don't usually freak out towards him over small things (I more identify with the quiet borderline thingy), most of my problems and meltdowns are aimed at myself and it pains him to see me be so hard on myself and suffer. So that shows me for sure that he cares. I just hate that he said he ""saved"" me. Because he did not and even if so, that makes me feel more broken idk and like I can't have a problem with how he treats me. I hope to get us into therapy together at some point soon, because without a moderator, I don't think things are going to get better. We're both too emotional and irrational lmao"

Interestingly enough the real him showed almost instantly after we lost our virginity together. (Apologies for the TMI 😂) It just makes me wonder. But yes definitely, I've been trying to have serious talks here and there but it just seems to go very wrong, then he realizes he messed up after I've already hit my peak insanity, then things are good for a few days/week then bam it happens again. It's very exhausting. Thank you for your comment ❤"

But I had a psychologist tell me I couldn't possibly be borderline because I try to control myself from freaking out outwardly to others. Like huh? Apparently people with bpd can't learn coping skills or whatever bc that makes them not have bpd? Are we just a ball of uncontrollable mayhem always forever?"

ShaneDawson,exjkiqq,t1_exjg5en,1566352764.0,"He would never lmfao. Honestly if he did, I don't know how anyone would respond. Either they'd be happy he acknowledged onision's horrible behavior or they'd get pissed because he'd be acknowledging onision."

society6,ex2iaz2,t3_cr3j32,1565969931.0,Usually that means you uploaded a jpeg file. Upload a png one and you won't get the border if people choose transparent :) I think you'll still have a border if they choose regular stickers but it'll be way less thick
ShaneDawson,ewnga0v,t3_cp3cgy,1565577376.0,I've honestly forgot about it quite a few times. It's just not a big deal anymore. There are better people to watch in the meantime :)
ShaneDawson,evtjvc3,t1_evte8l9,1564771961.0,"I think it would be as well. I really hope he doesn't but again, they were filming during all that and it obviously affected them, or at least Jeffree (with whom they're filming closely with) so that's why I feel like they might say something or show how it affected their lives in the moment. That's just my thought. But I really hope they don't because it would be best for everyone to leave it alone"
Conservative,evqm5it,t1_evowlw6,1564694328.0,"Alright let me interject here; 

Gender dysphoria which is the thing that causes people to be trans, is indeed a mental disorder. It does indeed cause suicidal thoughts/tendencies/etc. I've always believed that and always will. However this is where I disagree with people of your mindset. What do we have to help them? Therapy doesn't help, there is no real medication for it, so what is there? Well there is hormone treatment and gender reassignment surgery. That's what most choose to do to lessen their gender dysphoria. So we sort of have something that works. It's true it does not cure gender dysphoria and there are still chances of suicidal thoughts/actions but it is lessened quite a bit. So that's a pretty successful option. 

&#x200B;

I believe we should still be searching for other possibilities, and many trans people believe that as well. I've heard from quite a few, in person and online, that they wish there was a med that would've made them comfortable as the gender they were born. Because again, gender dysphoria is all in the brain. It's a severe mental disorder that makes living impossible in the body you were given (but we covered that). But also again, we don't have that medication yet. But many hope for a future that it could be possible in.

&#x200B;

I do not believe kids should have a say in making decisions like that. I'm 100% on board with raising without gender ROLES (such as blue for boy, pink for girl, toys, ""boys are supposed to be tough and girls are supposed to be dainty"") that's really cool I think. But raising kids without GENDER or letting your kid completely switch genders is insane. And I believe it is a form of abuse. whether you letting your child do that is coming from a good place or not. It doesn't matter. 

&#x200B;

But back to what I was focused on responding to. 

Just because they are mentally ill doesn't mean they can't dress, identify, etc the way that would lessen their symptoms. You may come back at this with something everyone seems to say like ""oh so a 50 year old man can dress and identify as a little girl and be a pedo??"" 

No. I think any type of response like that is extremely ignorant and illogical. You know what I mean. 

You don't have to like what they do, you don't have to agree or support it. But just know that is their only option to make living easier. At least for now. I live with many mental health issues but I'm working with what there is available for me and what works. I'm very fortunate that my issues are pretty well known and there are so many options for me. People with gender dysphoria aren't so fortunate"
ShaneDawson,evibc11,t1_evi90fv,1564539906.0,"All over again is exactly what it means. It just means the subject in general. I never said they'd for sure show/talk about it, I never said they'd have a detailed playback of it, I'm just saying I have a feeling they may talk about it. Which they have every right to since they were filming during. I've just heard it a million times and I'd like to never hear ""James, he's straight"" again lmfao. That's my own thing. I'm not going to bitch about it if they do talk about it, it's just my own preference and worry. No biggie"
ShaneDawson,evhxk1b,t1_evhi7wd,1564533739.0,I never said it would be? I said it would be brought up. Please read my original comment
ShaneDawson,evgwcsj,t1_evgvxds,1564516905.0,"Yes I'm aware. But they're involved in the beauty community now so it's probably going to be brought up. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I hope I am buuuuuuuut"
ShaneDawson,evgw8i3,t1_evgtzog,1564516856.0,"I get that, but it involves Jeffree which makes me feel like they'll put it in. They'll show how it affected their lives for that time."
ShaneDawson,evgnwu4,t1_evge04x,1564513100.0,"While I agree (and would like to add I really couldn't care less how long it takes him), Shane could make things easier on himself by not staying up so long editing (that way he doesn't complain about how he hasn't slept from the schedule HE makes for himself) and he could hire, idk, somewhat professional editors that understand his style? He definitely has the money. But again, not saying people shouldn't give him a break with all this shit, it's just Shane could fix his situation easily and I guess that's why people get so annoyed. That's just my take"
ShaneDawson,evfthk5,t3_cjlpaz,1564501055.0,Only problem I have is I'm worried that we're gonna hear about the James Charles/Jeffree Star (and of course Tati) drama ALL OVER AGAIN. I know it has to be mentioned considering this is about the beauty world/makeup collab. I am so tired of that and it does not need to be brought up again. But it most likely will be
ShaneDawson,evakzrq,t1_evagi1i,1564350432.0,"It's really sad. I still like him and believe he's a good person, but yeah after all the ""king"" ""oprah/ellen of youtube"" shit, it definitely has changed him."
ShaneDawson,eva6iba,t1_ev9hiby,1564340061.0,"I'm not sure who called them that first but if I remember correctly, Shane did call them ""documentary style videos"" once when he was going off on fans for some reason and wanted to make it sound like he was doing God's work by making those type of videos for FREE for us peasants lmao. But other than that incident, I'm not really sure if he still calls them that but I assume so"
ShaneDawson,ev66y28,t3_ci7klt,1564243274.0,"I used to love this stuff but now I can't handle watching it lmao, it makes me feel so weird. I'm not even someone who gets offended over it, I have a dark sense of humor myself but good lord. That's a lot."
ShaneDawson,ev5oxuv,t1_ev30g33,1564236899.0,"Oh yeah I forgot that part but I totally agree. None of his videos have ever been ""documentaries"" and this whole time it would make me cringe when I'd see them being called that. They're just long ""tune in next time to see what shocking thing happens next!"" videos"
ShaneDawson,ev1mxjw,t3_ci1nyb,1564161615.0,"I agree with her on everything except I don't get why people expected Shane to go deep into the situation? At least THIS one. It's so soon, obviously you wouldn't want to ask someone like that a bunch of invasive, possibly triggering questions. And correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think he ever labeled it a documentary? This was honestly just a video to lighten things up, show she's slightly progressing, etc. I don't think Shane ever intended for this video to be hella deep and informative about her life. It was just a little thing to do for a friend. I think Jaclyn did the right thing then and now. It's good she came out with the real information but it isn't Shane's fault for not knowing or not talking about it. He literally can't because of Eugenia's lawyer and he was never going to be like ""hey so I heard your mom went psycho on Jaclyn for trying to help you"" to her. Eugenia will never go against her mom or the way her sick brain believes. That's mental illness for you. And I'm not just on the outside looking in, I have a lot of mental health issues (including ED) so I get the way of thinking. Idk this is all just getting out of hand. 

&#x200B;

So basically how things are:

Shane is not in the wrong.

Jaclyn is not in the wrong.

Eugenia is not in the wrong (everyone just needs to wait and hope for the best.)

Eugenia's mom is suspect"

I hope things get better for you<3"
BPD,euqrfxd,t3_ch80xi,1563984090.0,"I relate a lot. I'll be feeling extremely suicidal and be on the verge of a meltdown and still try to help someone else who's saying they want to die. I help everyone as much as I can, but if I try to talk to my friends or they message me bc they're ""concerned"" and I tell them how I feel, I literally always get the response ""same"" ""me too"" ""relatable"" like ok thanks. I don't get mad at them but it feels like no one gives a fuck. But at the same time I kind of want everyone to stop giving a fuck about me and hate me?? Like I either want to help and get the same energy back or I want nothing and to do absolutely nothing and not care. But I can't stop caring. I still try to help, I still have a hard time saying no, I still feel guilty putting my health first. It sucks. Just know you're not alone in this"

We know twitter is nothing but YAAAASSSS RYLAND N SHANE<33333, reddit is the place of more sense (I feel like he avoids reddit for that reason just like Shane) however looking at the past, youtube comments seem to be half and half and he has noticed the ""hate"" on there and how people hate this act so he's fully aware...but keeps doing it."
ShaneDawson,eu5a6r4,t1_eu56826,1563473169.0,"Dude you're misunderstanding me. I think it's completely ridiculous but Ryland get's shit for every single video because he acts like a rich snob. It's his shtick and even though I hate it, I'm over seeing the same complaints. We get it, he did it again. And he'll keep doing it because it's his thing"
