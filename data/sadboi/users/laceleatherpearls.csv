RBNSpouses,fr2hdav,t3_gm765n,1589837306.0,"Boy can I relate to this! I was diagnosed with PTSD several years ago and it can be a challenge to process other people's anger. It's a struggle for me to accept my own anger too and accept I'm allowed to feel angry and act angry if it's an appropriate response. It's hard for me to accept other people can be mad and express their anger in an appropriate way also. 

A lot of people that go through trauma caused by other people tend to avoid conflict. It's hard for us to speak up for ourselves and seeing other people's emotions can be triggering for us. If you included a power Balance (like talking to someone with authority like a boss or a cop) I freeze up."

You may not qualifying for a PTSD diagnosis because less than 3 months is pretty fresh. Your brain is definitely still processing it. There are things you can do to decrease the chance of developing PTSD and I strongly recommend you find a professional of some kind as soon as possible! 

With all that said, YES! That is super common!! A brain with PTSD is not functioning correctly. It can cause all kinds of problems. I've heard PTSD described as a ""brain injury"" because of how much it does physically changes the brain.  

For me personally, and remember I had a very extreme case, my higher thought processes were SHIT. At one point I started researching dementia symptoms because I had so many over lapping symptoms. I couldn't remember basic words. I couldn't form full sentances. I couldn't preform basic math skills like addition and subtraction. 

I do not have any of these problems anymore! I recently graduated college, something I failed at many times in my life.

I'm sorry this turned out as a long responce, but my answer is YES! These symptoms are normal! Yes! It does get better!

I always recommend a free CBT or DBT workbook you can download online. Anxiety is a very real and also a very large topic. I always recommend self soothing and self care. And in some cases, like mine, medication.
