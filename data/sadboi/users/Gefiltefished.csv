Also, I was able to take a one month vacation to Perú, where I was born, and upon returning a bit over a month ago, and experiencing the ugly reality of my current job, fell into a funk almost immediately. The ugly reality hit me in the back of the head like a sledgehammer. In Perú I was in the highlands - the Cusco region - and got to see the archaeological sites and the land itself, as well as the people, and honestly I never wanted to leave the place, once there. The landscapes, history, etc. are beyond amazing. 

While in Cusco I met a friend from Lima who I haven't seen in fifteen years who works as a tour guide/planner. He got the job quickly many years ago by just speaking Spanish and English, and told me to send the recruiters my CV, however my CV is not that great at all - must work on that - and they require CPR and first aid training, which I can learn. Been a boy scout as a child but not sure if that counts. 

Anyway, that would be a great option to start, even if it means working on jobs similar to the one I currently have until I make it back to Perú.  At this point, any change is good. Keeping busy is good as well, but working a horrible job is not good at all."

So yes, I'm leaving - it's either that or a very ugly fate - and even if they don't pay the full benefits, I must leave this job for the sake of life itself. 

Regardimg the medication, I'm currently on Duloxetine for depression, Clonazepam for anxiety, and Ibersartan for hypertension, but the hypertension pills aren't helping much, so must speak to the doctor about this.

Where I live healthcare is free, but one is supported to pay some small monthly amount if one isn't working after a two month grace period. In my case I'm sure I'll land something after quitting the call centre.

The idea of two part time jobs is great - will definitely look into this. Whatever works best. One thing that I'll do as well is speak to the people at the Ministry of Labour - I'd like to see if anything can be done to get the full benefits.

Depression is one big, ugly, smelly bitch. I want to file a complaint to the Ministry of Labour so I can get all my benefits, but the company has its own lawyers, and they can lie about absolutely everything. Not sure if it would be worth it, but wouldn't have anything to lose either."

solotravel,euak33v,t3_cfje0b,1563622377.0,"In my 20's I spent about six years living in hostel dorms, so the following is my experience:

Nowadays hostels have lockers to keep your valuables, many times underneath the bunk beds. If they're not there, they're on a wall. You'll get a key or magnetic wristband. Use the lockers. You might come across an insane or dodgy person here and there. Ignore whatever toxic character you come across, and be watchful. If you feel uncomfortable and have to change rooms, by all means proceed and do so. The hostel most likely will accommodate you somehow - nowadays they're very rating conscious. 

You could very well meet really cool folks with awesome vibes in the dorms, but most folks stay in one place for too little to get to know them well. 

It can get noisy. Do not be afraid to tell the loudmouth/s to keep it down. If you stay in a hostel long enough, you could very well get used to it and sleep regardless of the noise. Earplugs work like a charm. 

All in all, with the proper precautions taken, you should have lots of fun if you stay at a nice place. Try not to worry too much about your stay. You will acclimatise to a dorm, and if you'd like more privacy, you can always stay in a private room. The rooms without private bathrooms are cheaper though. 

Those were my two cents, and greetings from a hostel in Cusco, Perú. Currently staying in a private room, as my dorm days are over."

I've attempted a very heavy overdose before and nobody went to check on me at the hospital.

It's ultimately infuriating. The more time passes the more bitter I become. I'm still hopeful that one day I won't want to try to hurt myself and heal emotionally.
