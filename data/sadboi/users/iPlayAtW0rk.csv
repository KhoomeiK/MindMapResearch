Whether the GE is used in this case doesn't seem to matter. He definitely can do it, but OSRS can either be played for fun or it can be min-maxed to death. So if he wants to do that, sure it can work, it's just not that viable anymore."

OSRS is the more popular game, and it deserves it too since it's more fun imo.

Gathering ore and smithing the gear is not a great way to make money unless you're in free to play, then smithing rune 2h swords is a good money maker. It's often seen as not viable as the grind to get the required levels is extremely long and there are better options to make money as a member.

Gathering ore is a profitable method on its own. Additionally you can smith cannonballs but the gp/hr and xp/hr is not great. But it's afk, so some people like it."

And found that I like the New Balance 1400v6 because of the price point, appearance, availability in wide width, and generally well received reviews. In a perfect world I would get a size 9 3E but the 2E will have to do since no one seems to make 3E shoes. I do mostly trail running.

I want to know if these shoes still hold up, since recent in reviews people saying they aren't as good as the v5. I kind of expect some folks to complain about a new revision of just about anything, so I was wondering if anyone has some personal exp to share about this shoe. Thanks!!"

For example the Samsung wired earbuds - they gotta be kidding me. I have these and they don't block most of the outside sounds.

The Bose QC35 is good for active noise cancelling. Another pair not on the list is Sony WH-1000XM3 whose noise cancelling feature is better than the Bose headphones. I believe many closed back headphones will also do the trick to block sounds."

I could be wrong though, I don't really know since there are so many opinions out there.

I can find them on Newegg, but their returns tends to be annoying with a restocking fee. I can try Walmart since I can return in store, but it's not sold directly by Walmart and instead by a 3rd party so I don't know if I can trust that.
