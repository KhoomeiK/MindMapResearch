At this point in life I was 13 and after those first four WS rings it was literally inconceivable that they could lose. The shock of it was unreal, but watching the Diamondbacks celebrate was what did me in. Whenever something bad happened, there was always the thought that the Yanks could come back, and that feeling was just... gone.

We also can’t forget that just before the election, Comey’s public announcement that he was reopening FBI investigations into an issue that involved Hillary might have had some serious consequences, especially when it comes to how the media portrayed the issue in a more damaging light than was the case.

But ultimately Hillary’s blind spot was she didn’t know what the people in those states were saying, didn’t put in the effort to campaign or show them that she was listening, and Trumps message resonated because they actually thought someone cared about putting them back to work.

FlashTV,f30qocu,t1_f30e5x5,1570560295.0,"So I always saw this as a result of two competing forces from the writing. They could make a show that is super accurate and consistent in terms of super power constraints, but doing so would limit a lot of plots devices that hinge upon the superhero being defeated when they fail to develop a believable vulnerability. On the other side, you have less power continuity, but are freer with the plots, and can more easily build tension and conflict. 

For the former, it is harder to think up conceptual threats to a character so OP, and you get a show that’s just about clever power matchups. The latter leads to less of a plot emphasis on powers but also a great many deuce ex machina endings.   

Good superhero writing balances these forces, but eventually there will be imperfections on both ends if your show runs for several seasons with many episodes.

This is partly why the earlier seasons are so good. Barry’s powers are so new it’s believable for him to get beaten easily, but it also paves the way for clever defeats with those powers as he comes into them. And  the final blow that took down Thawne wasn’t because Barry finally became the Flash of lore, it was from Eddie. We saw a great balance of defeating villains with clever power reveals and clever plot developments."

I took a cursory glance of your comment history and you truly are a remarkable piece of shit. Not only do I have a degree and a solid career, i don’t spend my days tirelessly fuming about Islam like a fucking loser. You’re pathetic."
sadcringe,f0plauo,t1_f0pjr09,1568837040.0,Only an idiot looks at a list of 750 people and thinks they represent 2.5 billion. There are thousands of universities in the arab world. Take your anti-Islam bullshit and go fuck yourself.
sadcringe,f0phdbq,t1_f0pd6ob,1568834739.0,"First of all, nowhere in the Quran does it say knowledge in it is the only knowledge. That’s ridiculous considering it’s a spiritual text with laws only for how worship is to be done and how a life of worship is to be led. Secondly, there are 2.55 billion muslims in the world, many of whom are literal fucking scholars and scientists. You’re not just wrong fundamentally, you clearly have never met a muslim."
