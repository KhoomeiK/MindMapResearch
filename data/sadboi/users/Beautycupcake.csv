mentalhealth,fnfa7ua,t1_fn6ivaw,1586904271.0,"My anxiety is quite high atm, I think it’s because of being on lockdown tbh. But I’m having anxiety attacks 3-4 times a day and I just get concerned if it’s gonna have a long term affect on my heart with it being under so much pressure all the time."
mentalhealth,fnf9zsg,t1_fn6kd6g,1586904150.0,"Thank you, I do believe I am just overthinking, I think I’m more worried because I went through a phase where I had continuous chest pains for a week, literally non stop and I ended up going to the hospital with extremely high blood pressure, first thing they asked was if I had anxiety, after they said to me “yeah that’s probably what it is” I immediately began to relax. I check my heart rate regularly now and keep track of it."
mentalhealth,fnf9l1m,t1_fn71fzr,1586903934.0,"I’ve done the whole therapy/counselling thing, tried meditation, yoga etc... I actually used to use the headspace app too. I always use grounding methods during my anxiety attacks. I’ve tried keeping a diary, I’ve tried daily mood charts, I was on medication for a while too but due to my age my doctor took me off of them as they were a type of beta blocker. I’m more concerned that my anxiety attacks could be having a more long term effect on my heart due to the pressure it’s under during an attack, and recently I’m having attacks 3-4 times a day."
mentalhealth,fkc3ki4,t3_fhghgx,1584045106.0,"I did counselling for a few months and I was always told mediation is really good, I tried it a few times and I think it’s worth a shot. Yoga is another thing to try. 

Doing things that you enjoy, such as art or singing or listening to music is a good idea too. 

It’s not much but I hope this helped ❤️ x"
mentalhealth,fj52tre,t3_fb723n,1583022864.0,"I did this for my cousins birthday meal, there was this girl going who literally sent me back into severe depression and made my anxiety really really bad so I said I wasn’t going, my cousin made me feel really guilty about it so I’m the end I said I would go, however this led to a huge argument and I didn’t have to go anyway. But my cousin made me feel like I was doing it out of spite and that I was just trying to find reason not to go. She didn’t realise how bad it actually was, I had had complete meltdowns over this girl and wouldn’t leave my room for days on end, my attendance at school dropped, I stopped talking to all my friends, just isolated myself really. 

If you really don’t want to go don’t force yourself to do it, it will only make you feel 100x worse. X"

I’m 16 but I live in the uk so I have free health service her and I used to work with a counselling company. Even though I didn’t need to tell my parents, I actually asked my doctor what he thought was best, he told me to tell my parents, it’s better to have more people supporting you and encouraging you to continue with treatments and help you at home. I highly recommend telling them."
mentalhealth,fimn3v6,t3_f8noep,1582538024.0,"I understand where you are coming from. I felt the same way for a while and still get days where I feel like this, the only reason I didn’t go through with it was because I alway thought about how it would affect my family. I love music, singing and art, I found no joy in them, I would stay in bed for days on end and I wasn’t eating properly. Eventually I literally looked myself in the mirror and said “what the hell are you doing, pull yourself together and get a grip. Enough of the self loathing!” And I literally shouted at myself, no one else was gonna do it so I had to do it myself, now although sometimes I still have my down days I am in a much better place. Sometimes you need to give yourself some tough love."
mentalhealth,fimmw4n,t3_f8ls52,1582537715.0,"Take the blade away, 100% she might not be happy about it but if you leave it there your giving her more opportunity to do it. My sisters a self harmer I’m 16 (F) and she’s 21. I am always at her back and call every time she harms herself, she lives with her fiancé now and she did recently cut again but we allowed her to have her razors back because we thought she was getting better. Now she’s back to having a razor for when she goes in the shower and then they get locked away. Sometimes you have to give them some tough love."
mentalhealth,fimmrgg,t3_f89un5,1582537528.0,"My mum does this to me all the time, before I was diagnosed I told her I thought I had anxiety and was suffering from panic attacks and she said to me “you can’t call it panic attacks if you aren’t diagnosed with it.” She always used to make me feel really bad about having an anxiety attack because I was “stressing her out” and “making her feel bad” and I was being “dramatic” when she was the person who caused my first ever panic attack. This still continued after I was diagnosed and getting treatment, it was horrendous. Luckily my stepdad was more understanding and accepting of my situation and always made sure that I was okay. 

My advice, take it with a grain of salt as they say. Try not to let it get to you, find someone who you can talk to about these things and who will make sure you know that it isn’t your fault. X"

I used to sit and look at the stars and just talk to him, but I alway used to get the feeling that someone was watching me... you may not believe in spirits but I do and I know it may have been my dad trying to let me know he was there but it used to scare the life out of me so I stopped. 
I still have a ring that he bought me which is between 7-8 years old that I wear everyday, it makes me feel close to him x"

I’ll try and google something’s and see if there is anything more I can do, I have worked with doctors and counsellors before, maybe another visit to them would help?... thank you for replying x"
mentalhealth,fi25x0v,t3_f5qn9j,1582072209.0,"I suffer with anxiety, panic disorder as wells as depression and an OSFED. I have thought about taking my own life one too many times but I always stop myself because I feel like it is selfish of me to inflict so much pain on my family. Without that thought, I don’t think I would be here today. When I am having a panic attack I do feel guilty then too, but I just remind myself that it’s okay to go through it, some days are better then others and under some circumstances you need to put yourself first. If it is getting to the point where you can’t control it anymore, see a specialist. It helps x"
