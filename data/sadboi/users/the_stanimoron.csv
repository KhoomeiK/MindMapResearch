Now put it 1 inch away from your eye and perceive how big it looks, not the actual physical size.

BipolarReddit,fh56cop,t3_f1c9c3,1581285462.0,"from personal experience, quetiapine is a massive mental focus and clarity killer, however I have always noticed the depression that follows bouts of (hyper)mania whether it be mental as well as physical does take a massive impact on your thinking. I spent close to 4-5 months last year after being admitted to a psych ward trying to study a higher level maths course and struggling immensely at the time, while also adamantly  believing that I was not depressed simply because of the fact that i was not at all suicidal. But is important to note that mental slowness does pass some time after an episode, and looking back now I can see that time and commitment to therapy and the right meds does wonders for both mental and physical wellbeing
