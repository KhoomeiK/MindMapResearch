You’re indoors = you’re safe

You’re safe = no visit to the doctor 

So by deductive reasoning you’re saying police, EMS, utility workers, delivery personnel, healthcare workers, and all other essential workers are not taking this seriously? That’s a bit insensitive.


Might want to read up on the definition of deductive reasoning champ."
TrueOffMyChest,fmkgcc0,t3_fvo5pt,1586154008.0,"COVID-19 makes me question my career choice and I hate it.

I love taking care of people as a physician. No matter how terrible the people were, most of the time I didn’t let it get to me. I try to not let it bother me that I care about people’s health (or their children’s health) more than they do. I try not to take it personally when I try to find the cheapest/most effective medications for patients I can and they get mad that it costs them $10.

COVID-19 has caused me to tilt.

I see friends and coworkers go into clinic every day, no supplies, no support, horrible working conditions for less money than they deserve. I have PPE that I’ve mailed (and received) across the country between a group of family and friends because we don’t all have enough. I see nurses, respiratory therapists, doctors, and other providers just sob because they’re overwhelmed. 

Then I see people out at grocery stores, home improvement places, and parks with no concern for social distancing. I see people on social media arguing tooth and nail against logic and medical advice saying everyone is overreacting. I see politicians being self serving and doing nothing to help the people they were elected to support.

I sat on my porch this evening as I listened to my governor say our state didn’t need shelter at home orders because we don’t have as many cases as other states. 

Honestly all I could think to myself is humanity deserves this. For every one heroic person giving everything to help others, there are a hundred more reselling masks, spreading false information, and being hateful towards others based on their race or occupation. I hate the fact that I lived to see this day but honestly.

You people are not worth dying for."

depression_help,fhlzz61,t1_ff8bkpf,1581706791.0,"Thanks for your comment and sorry this is a bit over due. I’m still here, I’m trying to make progress day to day. I feel like I’m in a better place than I was two months ago but the improvement comes with a lot of work. Since the new year I’ve tried to look a bit more into the positives of every day and try not to let the little things eat away at me.

I’ve started trying to set goals for myself: eating better, learning a new language, spend time with friends, try new hobbies. These things have helped keep my mind off things. 

My wife has been a good support system for me as well. I talked to someone on one of these subs when I posted this, and their (as well as everyone else’s) encouragement was enough to push me to talk to her about what’s going on. Her support has been invaluable as well. I would recommend talking to those around you who you trust, reaching out when you need help, and trying to make small goals to strive for. I’m also currently looking for a therapist to help for those particularly bad days."
depression_help,f9c0bte,t1_f999cw2,1575218095.0,"My wife has discussed this with me. And to some degree I’ve tried it, but I think my personality gets in the way of me doing this effectively. I’m such a realist and logically minded person that as I sit there and dwell on how irrational my thoughts are it just makes me more frustrated that I have them. For years I have just shoved these feelings down and tried to focus on the good in life. But I feel like this didn’t allow me to properly vent or process those feelings I had. It borderline overwhelmed me when I realized that I was actually sad and not just tired/stressed. And it sounds dumb to say that out loud, but genuinely I had always chalked my feelings up to stress and exhaustion from going through school."

There are certain things in my life that I realize have been traumatic and am trying to find healthy ways to come to terms with them. I think one of my issues is just being such a perfectionist. Trying to be the perfect physician, husband, son, brother, friend, and member of the community I know is an unrealistic mindset but it’s hard to break."

depression_help,f9bxzy0,t1_f9b0j4a,1575217426.0,"Thank you for your words. And you are correct, I am aware of the protocols but it seems so different when I’m trying to be introspective. This is my second year in practice, for the last ~10 years or so I’ve been killing my self trying to get through school and training. Always being tired, always being stressed and over worked, I got used to this being my normal. I figured once I started my job, some of those stressors would go away.

I was actually looking at a patients entry paperwork for my clinic (I’m not a psychiatrist, but a type of primary care) and saw their responses to the depression questionnaire. It had been a while since I had read the actual questions and I found myself agreeing to a number of them. It caused me to start thinking if what I am experiencing is just a normal “bad day” or something more. I think the biggest thing in struggle with is accepting it and asking for help. I’m so used to helping others and being a support for others it makes me feel guilty reaching out. I do my best not to push others away, but I should be more open with them. In my mind I know what I need to do, I just felt like I needed outside validation (even from people I don’t know on Reddit) to make this real, and make it a priority."

Some days it’s all I can do to get out of bed, but I paint on my smile and overly energetic personality and no one is any wiser to how I’m really doing. I feel like this aspect isn’t the issue for me personally, the issue is dealing with the other emotions in a manner that is beneficial to both myself and others.

I feel like I do or say things that I want people to do or say to help me, and I feel like at times it isn’t received well. I have a father like that too, and when I was an adult was when I finally told him some of the things I felt growing up.

He cried. He had no idea. I would like to say after that our relationship and his help magically got better and honestly it didn’t change much. Your dad is probably overwhelmed too. Or is trying to help in a manner than he thinks is helpful. Maybe try talking to him again and just explain what you’ve said here. Tell him you appreciate his concern but the manner in how he does it, isn’t providing you the support in a way you need. Good luck"

depression_help,f8rpgev,t3_e1tk0j,1574747716.0,"Been there my friend. Good news for you is that Jr/Sr high is absolute garbage. This is coming from someone who I feel like my experience in HS was better than most. Teenagers can be selfish, good teachers at that level are hard to find, and it can feel like your left out there alone. I’m not saying that graduating will make everything magically better, but getting out in the real world I personally feel is much easier to find a good support system.

Now that I’m years removed from HS and college, I realize that most adults (like myself) don’t feel like adults. We’re just teenagers trapped in bodies that hurt when we eat too much Taco Bell. I would like to think that maybe your family just takes your presence for granted. We all get caught up in our own stuff and put the people closest to us on the back burner. Which can make it feel like we don’t care. Maybe talk to them, might surprise them to hear you say these things.

I hope you know that you’re not invisible. And we’re not just people on the internet. Were parents, siblings, friends, loners, students, doctors, cashiers, and everything in between and even though I don’t know you, I care about you as a person and hope you find some comfort in these words."

For example: hiking, biking, tennis, golf, ping pong, dance arcade games, laser tag, swimming, skating, racquetball, yoga, gardening, volunteering at a pet shelter, bowling, or anything else non-traditional for exercise.

You could also look for ‘exercise games’ for hobbies that you already enjoy. They’re like drinking games but with physical activity. For example, Ive seen guides on Reddit where you have to do certain exercises when something happens in a tv show you are watching. Or if you like video games, “every time you _(fill in the blank)_, do 10 sit-ups.” 

Doesn’t have to be going to the gym for an hour, 5 days a week. It’s often the small lifestyle changes that stick and can help you move into bigger changes as you continue on."
