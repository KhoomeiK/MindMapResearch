Anxiety,faj60w0,t3_e9g3r0,1576125514.0,"I share similar experiences ... its all because our mind isn't ready to settle for one thought or feeling .It wants seek everything that runs in the world leaving us feel very overwhelmed and edgy. So we must train the mind to stay quite for a while...I recommend you do sime meditation...
1.Close your eyes
2.Imagine a picture of something that gives you strength like a sword or your version of God
3.Focus the picture as if its on your forehead
You only need 2-3 mins to for this and helps you a LOT"
