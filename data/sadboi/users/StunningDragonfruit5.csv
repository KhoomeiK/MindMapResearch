Just google search for example ""game mechanics Pokemon revolution"" and some useful links will show up. Their are regional guides, money making guides, leveling guides, boss guides and everything. There is also a website called pro wiki which has most guides too. There is also help chat in the game where many people will answer any of your questions. You can also join the discord server which has been very helpful to me. Hope this helps"
NoahGetTheBoat,fotr5k4,t1_foteex0,1588063185.0,"I am an Indian girl and I want to expand on this from my experience. I have felt unsafe even during the day walking in the streets. I have seen grown men stare at me and so many other girls that are just minding their own business and it's just so uncomfortable. Even my brother who is 12 has described some experiences with random grown ass men touching him and talking to him when he is coming back from school and that has made me extremely paranoid about him. So every chance I used to get I would go pick him up after school. 
Even my own relatives have made me feel uncomfortable. One of my uncles had grabbed my hand so roughly and he would often try to touch me and come to my room alone. I tried to limit as much as contact with him after that. My brother also described such incidents with that uncle as well. 
I thought that maybe the guys my age group would be better but nope I have heard them talk about girls from school and it was in such a degrading manner that I felt like throwing up. 
My experience is nothing compared to all the other girls that have told me about their experience and all the other things I have read online but I just wanted to throw in my experience as well since I have not been able to open about it anywhere."
