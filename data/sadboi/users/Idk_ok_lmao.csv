It can become addicting. For me it never felt good. It was just a distraction. Honestly  there's different reasons for why they do it.

You can find another healthy coping meganism, if you feel very low. But please don't.

Edit: Saw your other reply. You may be able to controll your urges, but you can't be too sure.

Before I never understood addictions. Why people smoke and such. Why can't they just stop? I thought it was easy, it sounded at least very easy. I thought ""if that was be I would just stop. What's so difficult about that"". It's not easy. It may seem like it at first but it's not.

OR the ice snow. It's ice snow. Just like what it says. And much more slippery. And it kinda hurts when you press your hand through it, it probably won't even go through if you're not pressing hard enough.

Then we have the vet snow (mostly in the start of spring or the end fall). Where it's getting warm after winter or getting cold after summer. There's snow but it was rained. The snow is now soggy and maybe also mixed with dirt if you're at the park.

Like everyone says in general snow is beautiful if untouch. It gets boring after a while and a struggle to go to places. To be honest I can't stand the cold.
