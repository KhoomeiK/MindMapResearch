Like Arches Cold Press - 10"" x 14"", 12 sheet pad is $28 at Michael's and not on ""sale"" at the moment for once, so the coupon would make it about $16.80. Whereas it's $18.04 on Amazon right now. 

But of course, it's sold out online at Michael's, and I bet if I went to our store 30 min away, they'd most likely be having one of those dumb category-wide sales like ""30% off all paper"", so that you can't even use the dang coupon. 

But I just want to buy it as needed, when I need it, for a good price, without having to triangulate a bunch of coupons and sales.

And personally I think it's dirty that they even mark the items up so high to begin with. It turns me off from even wanting to shop with them. If I can always use a 40% off ""coupon"" to get it for $16.80, then just friggin' charge $16.80 for it."

FrugalFemaleFashion,ez9djqu,t1_eysh8ft,1567779702.0,"Okay biggg ol rant on how fakes are very easily possible. 

Also a Nordstrom employee here, in the fulfillment center now for the last 6 years. 
All online returns come to one of these fulfillment centers, and most of the in-store return items do too. 

Everyone in the warehouse has a ""home department"", but we get transferred where we're needed if one is busier than another. 

Sooo, if Returns is busy after something like a sale or Christmas, tons of us get transferred over there. We'll get a like 20-min crash course on what to do. Find the return slip, look up the order, find the item being returned, credit the customer, throw it in a bag and send the item off to Inspections. 

We are held to strict time standards and get less than 5 minutes to process each return. At that point, all we're looking for is the brand, size and color to match what was bought. So unless it's something glaringly obvious, like a different color, then any authenticity differences are not going to be noticed.

The next department (Inspections), checks to see how worn/damaged the item is, (but still isn't really trained much on signs of authenticity). 
And they get even less time @ literally 50 seconds per piece. 
The running joke there is to just ""close your eyes and fold."" 

Otherwise, actually inspecting the piece, lint rolling, cleaning, even buttoning it up, etc. takes up too much time. If you don't find a way to meet the time standards, eventually you'll lose your job. For most people, that way is to just not look too closely. 
I feel very bad about the quality they secondhand force us to send back out with the lousy time standards. I always say I don't hate the customer enough to work in Returns full time. 

Anyway, after inspecting, the piece is marked ""Good"" or ""Poor"". If it's ""Good"", it will go back to stock.

If it's ""Good"" but out of season, (since we accept returns from 100 years ago), it will then go to...boom, Nordstrom Rack. 

We process tens of thousands of orders per day. I think the record right now is almost 40k in a day.
