publix,flzzacv,t1_flxw6t4,1585638682.0,Either that or you belong somewhere else other than that hellhole. Fuck Publix
SuicideWatch,floece6,t3_fq3hvu,1585336667.0,Hopefully the hospital isn't full where you are
publix,flnwm7y,t1_flnqwp0,1585327266.0,Watch it be a photo from like 2015
publix,flni0fz,t1_flnhu4d,1585319025.0,Yea people are getting wet over a picture of him unloading one pallet. Give me an hour vlog of him unloading the trucks all day or dealing with customers  with 0 patience.
publix,flnhk1x,t1_flnh2za,1585318748.0,Agreed
WrestleFap,flh1rj7,t3_fopqxm,1585154488.0,Can I vote for all?
SuicideWatch,fjmrphu,t1_fjmps28,1583480994.0,"I understand. I can't understand what you go through mentally but I've been there man. I've gone through some real trauma the past couple years but it's only made me stronger mentally. Life is a lot of work, it really is. Sometimes I just want to forget it all and off myself I mean if you look at the grand scale of things we mean nothing. We're just on a rock spec in the middle of the universe all alone. I feel like if I was born in an earlier generation without social media I would have a lot more purpose and also a more open and free society would be a lot better as well. This world needs a lot of work but first we need to fix ourselves."
SuicideWatch,fjmp68w,t3_fe9nv8,1583477992.0,I felt the same way. You just got to give yourself time man. Finding yourself is one of the hardest things to do in life. Trust your gut and your path will be shown eventually. I don't believe in crap like religion or that everything means something but the only way we can give meaning into our own life is putting it there ourselves. You got to find that meaning yourself my friend. Even now I wish I sometimes didn't exist because I wouldn't have to deal with bullshit but living is a luxury. We're lucky to be living to be quite honest. Don't take your life on this earth for granted.
SuicideWatch,fj66a3e,t3_fbs6za,1583058852.0,Yep same
WrestleFap,fj63s9t,t3_fbrqv7,1583055265.0,"Anal Asuka,  Facefuck Kairi, Cumshot Paige"
SuicideWatch,fiwrn9v,t3_faa712,1582799841.0,If you give it meaning it is worth fighting for. You have to find that meaning on your own. People think there's this universal meaning to life across the board for every human that's ever lived and it's simply not like that. Everyone has to find their own purpose and set their own goals to find meaning in their life. If you simply want to fade away I won't stop you man. Life is hard. But I do want to say one thing. It takes guts to live it doesn't take guts to die.
OnePiece,fiwopbt,t3_fa9hxh,1582795512.0,Woah.......more than 1000 episodes for a swimsuit
SuicideWatch,fiwob6n,t1_fiw9a3u,1582794940.0,In the exact same boat man. I just turned 20 and have been unemployed since May of Last Year. Worked at Publix for about a year and hated it. There were fun moments here and there but management made everything so much worse. It was not a great working environment and it was just unfair but I guess that's life for you. I got an interview this week at a warehouse job where I don't have to deal with shitty customers anymore so wish me luck.
melatonin,ffhjmnx,t3_et3qd9,1579938270.0,Damn maybe I should stop taking it. You've described my life for the past 3 years
publix,fejacb8,t3_epeooo,1579163960.0,Yeah Publix may be where shopping is a pleasure but it sure as hell ain't where working is a pleasure that's for damn sure.
SuicideWatch,fdtlfxt,t1_fdsgubx,1578718464.0,Why do I feel the same exact way.
SuicideWatch,fdtixs8,t3_emwque,1578717423.0,Real Depression is long term sadness. Being sad for a day or 2 isn't depression it's just being sad. Being sad is a feeling being depressed is a state of mind that needs to be broken to be happy again.
SuicideWatch,fdd5k8n,t3_eklf5d,1578295752.0,Yes agreed. Once I'm depressed and suicidal I choose to go to this sub because it makes me feel comfortable that I'm not alone. Before coming to this sub I would think I'm in the vast minority of people being suicidal. And that maybe I was weird or mentally retarded or some shit. But I know for a fact most people just hate life. You can either cry and complain or you can just move on and keep going. I just can't get over stuff I choose to hang on and it just fucks up my life in the long run. I wish people weren't as hateful as they were in today's society. It makes me feel unwanted and it just makes me feel unloved I hate it here and I wish there was one reason for me to stay except for family and a few close friends but there's not.
SuicideWatch,fcvorug,t3_eiyte3,1578006712.0,What state do you live in?
raceplay,fbwnkzv,t3_eepsex,1577154614.0,Damn you have any social media?
StarWars,fbloj1d,t1_fbliixm,1576966242.0,No I saw the spoilers. I knew what happened. It's not bandwagony if it's my own thoughts of what happened.
StarWars,fbl8g1f,t1_fbbw56c,1576959549.0,Just watched the movie last night. Still stand behind what I said.
StarWars,fbc7xiu,t1_fbbw56c,1576717817.0,Well I know what happens so I do have an idea. It's like reading about the Civil War but not experiencing it. You know about it you just haven't experienced it.
StarWars,fbb94sv,t1_fbacsu4,1576695622.0,I mean I've only seen the leaks. Haven't watched it yet. But it sounds like it's shit with even worse plotholes than TLJ.
StarWars,fba3lam,t1_fb9qid3,1576662719.0,Let's just say you won't like it if you're a big fan of the original trilogy.
SuicideWatch,fb7ljh2,t3_ebmmmq,1576593462.0,I honestly feel the exact same way about life. If you need to talk let me know.
SuicideWatch,fb3ts3u,t3_eb43w2,1576488726.0,Are you still alive is all I want to know
SuicideWatch,fb1i323,t1_fb1ht7c,1576437253.0,Yeah but even if they say something it won't change how they are you know. They're just dicks and that's just how they are. They'll change for maybe a day or 2 but go right back to being themselves. It's just the way they are. And yeah you're right finding a different job right now is what's best.
SuicideWatch,fb1hioa,t1_fb0yxkq,1576437027.0,Ahh I was tweaking there is HR. But even if I did say something to them the managers wouldn't change. And plus it's also the coworkers as well. They're all just assholes. There's like at most 10 chill people working there and like 25-30 dicks.
SuicideWatch,fay8cu2,t1_fay2n37,1576396494.0,Don't have HR bro lol literally every manager that I have is a corporate dickwad. There's no person that I could tell about it.
SuicideWatch,farjn5z,t1_faqdlsr,1576316827.0,"I'm the same way man. I feel unwanted. I feel like a fuck up. I feel like I'm on the island of misfit toys and no one wants to acknowledge me. My friends  will try to reach out out of kindness but nothing ever materializes. Life is so boring and repetitive and it's just not for me. I have no goals, no plan in life. It would be better if I just disappeared. From being bullied all through school to even being bullied at work. No one treats me as a human being except my close friends. It's just not a way to live. I may be looked at as whiny as well but fuck it man this is how I feel."
SuicideWatch,fadfoid,t1_fadb9ux,1575969028.0,I feel like I will too. Life is just pure pain for me. My childhood best friend killed himself a little more than a year ago and I just haven't been the same without him. My life just sucks and I want a Get Out of Life Free card.
SuicideWatch,fa9gdtt,t1_fa5qt2z,1575872654.0,"I sincerely don't get parents acting like that towards their children. My best friend killed himself a little more than a year ago and we were both middle class so we're both well off compared to people living in the ghetto sure. But I remember he used to talk to one of his friends about his depression and the friend would reply ""You have nothing to be depressed about, you have everything you need, why should you be depressed"" but my friend would say it's just my mental state. It's just how he felt. And he acted upon it and got what he wished sadly. Parents have to think what they say really. People in general need to think what they say. It's a tough world but people make it tougher for other people and I just don't get it."
SuicideWatch,f9x1iyi,t3_e7aa66,1575702958.0,"Yes man I feel you. Everyone will eventually feel this feeling, others may feel this sooner rather than later. But people look at death as something they're scared for, oddly enough I look at it as something to look forward to. Eternal nothingness like before you were born. Not having to deal with any shit from anyone. Not having to deal with bills, not having to deal with shit period. It sounds like eternal bliss to me even though I won't technically experience it, it's just nothingness."
SuicideWatch,f9m9ggr,t1_f9m0406,1575447361.0,"Hey man I understand. Life isn't worth living but you can't help but feel like maybe you should live longer to see what happens even though more despair is most likely involved. Life is difficult, it's as simple as that. The only way we can improve in life is to not overthink the negatives but overthink the positives. We're all lucky to be alive out of all of the sperm you are the one that won the race. We should be happy that we have been given life but you also feel like Existence isn't worth living. I feel the exact same way right now. What goal do we have as humans? Do we just live out our lifespan only for family members to remember us and they die as well. I mean what true purpose do we have as humans. It's hard to find your meaning or purpose in life individually as well as humanity wise. Well enough of me babbling I'm going to sleep."
SuicideWatch,f926217,t1_f91sivt,1575014247.0,Suicide is not for cowards. Suicide is for people that are lost. People that can't find their way in life and feel like they have no meaning in being alive. It's not that they don't want to deal with problems it's that they feel like they're the problem themselves.
SuicideWatch,f925v1x,t3_e38pje,1575013981.0,"I completely agree. There's not one reason for humans to be alive. We will all eventually die anyways so why bother. People say ""Oh that's not true find some goals and aspirations and make your life mean something"" but I'm afraid life in general is just the opposite, nothing. We are a species on one little blip of the universe. If we were to be destroyed by an asteroid/meteor nothing would change to the universe. If anything it would be better off without us because no other planet would have a chance of being inhabited by our retarded ass species which will deplete that planet of all of its resources anyways and we would go to the next one and do the same thing. People just choose to make themselves busy by getting jobs or going to school to make them feel like they're accomplishing something when in reality they're not. Nothing would change if everyone of us just died."
SuicideWatch,f3e3ljq,t1_f3bkwri,1570856295.0,Yes I feel like I would rather see my friends reactions instead of familys. Family is a given that they'll be upset but your friends feel the least for you at least that's how I feel right now. I would just like to see some people not including my family that care for me.
SuicideWatch,f3avcat,t3_d92gf2,1570793075.0,I wish to honestly see how people would react after killing myself without actually doing it so I can see if people even care about me. It would be nice to see people care about me for once.
publix,eqxj1gb,t1_equxpnj,1560370019.0,You don't wanna know what it's like at 95 trust me man.
