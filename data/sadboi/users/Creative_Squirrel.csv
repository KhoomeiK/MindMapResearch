 The fact that you have fought is not necessarily bad, people have tempers, and when you live with someone you are going to find things you both don’t like.

There’s a saying “the harder you fight the closer you are.”  ( the fact he was breaking obvious city ordnance rules is concerning as is ability to just leave though. ) could you have handled it better? Probably, but regardless please look after yourself.

 Not sure if it makes a difference but I experienced something quite similar where, Somebody abandoned everything, for a lot of reasons.

With that out the way

Yuno, Yuno feels like Kaede from Shuffle dialled up to 11. Yuno’s knife and axe wielding scenes feel very if not Homage to Kaede, then they really feel like the author was thinking of her when writing Yuno subconsciously. The twists were well done but Rewind and Redial needed to fix the major issues with the story, Yuno included.

Yuki, Yuki feels odd. At first he’s thrown into a bathtub full of sharks only to act like one during the confrontation with the mayor. Yuno basically pulls him through the fire. Yuno herself says It could have been anyone. Yuki does mature as a character, but the first third is very difficult to get through, simply because he seems to have no personal direction beyond being saved. 

Ninth, ninth is the best character in this show /manga hands down, and yes I love Yuno, (that pink haired maniac is.. look I’ll level with you (Yuno) she’s not Anna Senpai from shimoneta or akane from love tyrant but she’s a far more human Character  than either of those two even with her godlike powers. That’s why she (Yuno) always will hold  a special spot, in my eyes at least... ) but Ninth’s development  from personal loss, struggle and love simply functions as a better story than the game around her or Yuno and Yuki’s story. Redial is Ninth’s story (basically) her (Ninth) getting hope from those around her helps her grow. Yuno really doesn’t until she merged with the third world version of her who had a better childhood. 

Sadly we may never see a Yandere story of its like again and that is very sad. 

It has its detractors and it’s fans. The Manga is better imo, rewind has never been adapted sadly"

What stuck during this “ exchange “ if you can call most of an afternoon and part of an evening with one person talking at another was how much everything was awful there. 
His wife didn’t talk to him any more, his kids only spoke very rough English, his mother in law absolutely despised him, everything was bad, oh it’s always fish I’m so sick of fish, the list goes on ( so The list will be cut here as you probably get the idea)
