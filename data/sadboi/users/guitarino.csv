ThreadGames,fqflfr3,t3_gigd0d,1589327019.0,"We should have no governments. The economy suffers greatly because of taxes and regulations that are put on the persons: both individuals and corporations. If the taxes and regulations are cancelled, the economy will see more competition because there will be more people willing to participate in the economy, and smaller corporations will have less of a burden on their profits. We see businesses running away to foreign countries, because they cannot handle staying in the country due to taxes. If there's no governments, there will be more freedom and less poverty in this world. There are poor people only because the governments disincentivise them from working due to subsidizing their schools, paying pensions, paying for their medical care, maternal / paternal leaves, unemployment benefits. If these things are removed, people will be encouraged to work and be productive.

Moreover, we should open up the borders economically, by removing any import and export tariffs and allowing free trade in the international markets around the whole world. Everyone who knows economics knows very well that it is best for countries to specialize in a production of a single thing. If the borders are lifted, the countries will specialize and enhance the technology of that specialization to their extreme. This is the best way to develop third-world countries and lift them to the level of first-world countries, and it has proven to work countless times. I mean, the US became the biggest economy because they freely competed in the market with other countries and did not have strict import and export tariffs. Again, just like more free markets and bigger competition helps grow local economies, it helps grow the global economies, as if by the invisible hand.

The corporations are better and more productive structures because they are hierarchical. Hierarchy is a natural and better way of organizing. We see in everywhere in nature, there's always alpha-males and those that follow, we see it also in evolution, where only the strongest survive. Therefore, hierarchical corporations, where the orders are passed from top to bottom, are better than any other horizontal structure. In fact, we tried communism and saw that it did not work. I mean, look at USSR, that had a horizontal structure - it collapsed, look at China - its people are suffering. Just look at all other examples of non-capitalistic structures: there's never been a single example of a good, working one - they all fail because they are unnatural and, hence, impossible in the long term. Although seemingly contradictory, hierarchy is actually good for democracy. The best democracies (e.g., the US) have the biggest number of corporations. That's because, democracy, in truth, is a hierarchical structure, where people have access to elect their representatives, hence people are actually on the top, where orders are passed down to the organizations and other structures.

Also, Climate Change will be good for the economy because it'll allow ships to travel over the Arctic ocean.

Herd immunity is a real thing, but herd immunity is only good if people get vaccinated and not all get sick and die like flies. Hence, it works great with flu and other viruses you can vaccinate against. If, in order to develop herd immunity, it takes many people to die, and, hence, the economy to suffer permanent consequences, then it's not a good idea.

If the economy suffers, that's because of an underlying issue affecting the livelihoods of people that must be addressed before the economy can recover. What's the underlying issue? The deadly virus. How can we, as a society, get rid of the virus? One way: a strict lockdown for, say, a month, where human-to-human contact is reduced to nearly zero, and if the contact is necessary, precautions are required to restrict the spread (masks, hand sanitizers, distancing). That will solve the issue by making sure the virus did not spread from a person to person, and it would only take a month give or take. Another way: shitty non-strict lockdown (like we have), where it's not truly enforced, and the virus continues to spread. This kind of lockdown will last until the vaccine is invented. The first way will allow the economy to return to normal in a month. The latter way will make the economy suffer until the vaccine is invented, which could be years.

Oh yeah, there's another way - no lockdown. This will make sure that a substantial chunk of the population dies, an even more substantial - suffers permanently, an en even more substantial - suffers temporarily but severely, and the majority of the population - suffers somewhat. Oh yeah, and there will be a higher danger of the virus mutating and infecting people again and again, making a permanent mark on our life expectancy, making a permanent mark on the economy and the state of the world.

Feeling of calmness is not the main point of meditation, yet it is a component. If all you do is focus on being calm, you might experience the problem that you mentioned, though. But meditation is more important than that: it's about staying with whatever there is. If there's anxiety, if there's sadness, if there's pain, you're staying with it without blocking any emotion. It allows you to develop equanimity, but also allows you to see the world more clearly and from more perspectives. It also allow you to untangle your mind and focus on what your true interests are rather than following your short-term desires.

It is really good that you're aware that you have motivation problems. This awareness will help you avoid these problems getting worse, and will actually help you solve those problems. When you apply mindful awareness to your daily life, you will notice how each of your actions contributes to lack of your motivation.

I really think that in his mind, many ideas just kind of smashed together and created a bizarre and shallow worldview. His personal intolerance tangled together with his conservatism, his religiousness and his shallow understanding of cold war. His desire for ego pushed him to teach his flawed worldview to others. And, he got popularity because his worldview generated a lot of discussed controversy, and because it is suitable for the conservative ruling class, who's interested in divided and confused population. If Jordan Peterson was truly aware of his actions, aware of the world around him rather than his own ego, he wouldn't be a conservative who teaches a factually-incorrect framework.

Don't think I said anything contradictory to Karl Popper's views. I agree that intolerant views should be addressed. But the question is, how? Should we go ahead, mock and block certain intellectuals, thereby giving them popularity and a victim status? Or should we allow them to speak, yet convey a more factual reality, without ostracizing the supporters of those intellectuals? I think the latter is way more effective.

dostoevsky,fplke23,t1_fplgv4z,1588714289.0,"> evidence-based arguments have been proven to be completely ineffective against people entrenched in certain ideologies

I think all of us are like that to some extent. At least I notice that for myself, as much as I'd like to be rational and evidence-based, sometimes there's things I cannot admit when presented with facts. For example, I am Russian and I have certain opinions about World War II, my grandfathers served in the war, and, when my friend told me about how Russians committed a lot of rapes, I just could not take it, not even for a while after reading about it. But no matter how hard it is to admit it, it's true. Eventually I came to terms with it, even though at first, I was adamant it was all a fabrication.

I agree that we shouldn't tolerate intolerant views. But it's not effective to just go against someone, therefore only giving them more popularity. It is actually better to ignore them, but simply address false worldview. Intolerant people are simply misguided people - they deserve to be corrected, not mocked, not blocked. Mocking them is going to only generate more resistance and hate. Blocking them will give them an argument that they're victims of censorship and will only solidify their view that their freedom of speech is under attack."

Eventually the debate will turn so meta that the track to the original argument will be lost. Everyone will keep their opinion, and readers will be only more confused. I know it because I've experienced it.

There's a better approach: simply convey evidence-based truth. There's no need for mentioning Peterson, or others you disagree with, because that would only push away their audience. Be calm and confident, and have your multitude of evidence ready. That's also a way to be respectful to your readers - because everyone who learns, makes mistakes, and now is their chance to simply correct them."

However, for many people, Peterson has been a mentor and helped them through tough times, and inspired them to think about the world. That's notable. If people keep searching for truth, eventually they will reject his flawed framework and become less attached to him and his ideas. That's a normal, natural progression. That's why I don't go out of my way to convince people against Peterson, and also because it never really helps if you simply criticize someone."

Zosima even advised Alyosha not to become the monk and told him to wait and live his life as a regular person, because he believed that Alyosha will help the world and himself much better as a regular person. Just imagine how much of a rebellion it is against the Church to advise someone like that?

Overall, you have a lot of good thoughts. I see this whole lockdown as a sort of a big opportunity in many respects. In one respect it's an opportunity for personal development.

We are forced to be faced with ourselves. Some people, because they're not used to being face-to-face with themselves, get scared and try to run away with entertainment and distractions like TV shows, video games and other media. But, if you take that as a challenge and allow yourself to see yourself for what you truly are, without filtering, blocking and distracting, there's a lot that you can learn, and a lot that you can develop within yourself. For one, you can learn to love yourself, and, yes, it could be hard to love yourself at first, you can go from hating yourself to loving yourself. You can learn to love challenges and pain if you face them bravely. You can learn to love the world and develop compassion for it. Meditation and mindfulness has been my constant companion, and I try to see everything from the framework of mindfulness. I'm far from perfect and far from being where I want to be, but I now have calmness and a gentle confidence that I'm going in the right direction."

mentalhealth,fpcrlwh,t3_gcn0x2,1588510728.0,"I believe I can provide a bit of insight. I had a feeling of derealization a few times, where you feel empty and purposeless, and reality doesn't feel that real, and, since then, think I realize why it happens.

If you throw a ball up in the air, it'll fall in a predictable way. It will follow a parabola formula. Everything, from dust, to the ball, to stars and galaxies, follow similar natural law. Your consciousness, your mind, is also part of the universe, and it also must follow similar laws. There's also an aspect of your consciousness that gives you freedom of action and agency. Now, your mind also moves around, and it moves around in much more dimensions, because there's a lot more aspects of your mind, your thinking, your experience. Sometimes, as your mind moves around, it can reach a certain place, that is difficult to get out of. This place is like a really big empty room with four walls. The room is so big and so empty that you forget where the door is, and where the key is. So it could end up feeling like an empty prison, even though nothing inherently keeps you there. Now, it is not always bad when you feel like your agency and freedom is taken away: there are moments in everyone's life when people are actually happiest and most productive, they're in a certain flow that moves them naturally and allows them to work efficiently and creatively. However, in this case, the loss of agency and freedom feels really bad, because you are stuck in four walls, and everything feels endlessly empty, purposeless and not real. Emptiness is also not inherently bad - it is only bad when you're stuck between the four walls - a better place is nature that does not have any walls - this place is also full of creativity and free-flow (since emptiness cannot hinder the flow). The trick is to realize that the derealization room is not actually empty, because it has the four walls, and these four walls actually have a door somewhere, and you still have the key somewhere. And, yes, it is hard to find motivation to find the key, find the door, find motivation to walk through it, but it is not impossible, because nothing inherently keeps you there. How do you leave this prison, more specifically? I suggest trying out mindfulness practices, especially mindfulness meditation. This helps you find the key and find the door,  and improve your motivation to walk through. Once you do, you will find yourself in a much better and more natural place, a place that doesn't hinder you and allow you to be in the natural flow that does not restrict you, a place with a strong characteristic of purpose and reality."

Is there a feeling that you walk on the wrong path, like you imagine an alternative universe where you're walking on a different path that actually makes you happy?

It's a wrong feeling. The world **is** real. The feeling of derealizarion is an illusion. It's a mistake of the mind. Our minds, our brains make mistakes. Our mind sometimes seeks for meaning, for deep truth, and finds a really big, but empty room, and get stuck inside it. We are stuck in this room, and we forget where the keys are, where the door is, because the room is so big, and eventually we may even forget to look for the keys. The room is not totally empty, though, if you look closely. The room has four walls, giving you the feeling of being stuck inside four walls, being swallowed in total isolation, emptiness and lack of purpose. But it's a mistake. You have the keys, and the room is not empty. If it was empty, there'd be no walls, and no walls mean freedom and true happiness.

But there's no contradiction. The more you align your actions with deep self, the less pride feels like pride. It is devoid of a substance and power, it is simply a feeling that arises and passes like all others. It will not propel you to do anything, something else will.

What is the future? Does it exist? The past doesn't exist in anything but your memories. The future doesn't exist in anything but your imagination. The only thing that truly exists is ""right now"", this ever-lasting moment.

Let me make it clear. In the process of creating prosperity, we could destroy everything and everyone. Governments justified wars with the search for prosperity.

Not to mention, due to climate change, we are already on the way to the cliff and we can simply be inactive to eventually race off of it.

""Good"" usually means an action that aligns with our culture, our genetic and evolved behaviors, and the deeper nature of our existence and awareness.

If the serial killer is self-righteous, that means their actions, at the core, are inspired by their selfishness and emotion rather than a desire to help the victims. They may have a perspective that they're doing good, but the flaw is revealed by anyone who looks closely at their acts. Also, whether your action is good or not, is perhaps defined not by you, but by whether the action truly aligns with our nature. That's, of course, is more complicated because our different natures often come in conflict: our animal nature VS. our human nature, our frontal lobe nature VS. our limbic system, our thinking and planning nature VS. our awareness nature. When there's a lot of internal conflicts that a person is experiencing, they are less likely to live harmoniously. There's more confusion, beliefs are tangled with each other, with emotions, with thoughts, with habitual behavior, and this tangled mess can render a person at best at a loss, and at worst, malicious. Self-righteousness can come as a result. If the messy strands are untangled, and if the nature is allowed to connect the strands through love, then a true activity of doing good starts to happen."

Meditation,fp9986j,t3_gc1l6c,1588419107.0,"Let me demonstrate the problem you might be having. Imagine someone saying the following:

>I’ve  read all about exercising. I’ve done different types. I exercise off and on. It’s definitely “energizing” for a moment but later that day, I’m back to feeling weak. I don’t have the consistent health problems so it wouldn’t be beneficial for me in that sense. I struggle with remaining strong.

Do you see the problem?

Meditation is a kind of training. It's a training that has many different benefits, it can improve many areas of your life, including finding and keeping a purpose in your heart. If you do not practice meditation regularly (instead of on and off) and if you don't have some specific rules for meditation, then it might not be very useful.

Here's two tips that can make your practice successful: (1) meditate every day, (2) set a timer for each meditation session, for at least 10 mins. As with anything, when you start meditating regularly, it might be tough at first. Benefits are still away, and the habit is not solidified. However, soon enough, you will gain momentum, and this momentum will carry you forward, and the appearing benefits will also propel you forward. So, do not be scared to start the habit, it will get much easier once it becomes a norm.

There's a lot more to say, especially about your technique. In the beginning, especially if you only meditate for 10 mins, there's not much room for experimentation, so it's a good idea to follow some established rules:

1. sit with your back straight,
2. set a timer and do not stop the session until the time is up,
3. if your attention wonders to thoughts, gently bring it back to the present experience,
4. let yourself focus on outer experience (hearing, seeing, external feelings) and/or inner experience (mental sounds, visual thoughts, emotional body sensations)

If you follow these rules, you are very likely to have a productive session. Even if you struggled with rule (3), that's still a success: similar to gym exercising, if you struggle to do an exercise, your muscles still grow. Another **important** thing: remember to practice mindfulness meditation during your daily, especially routine activities - this can significantly boost your results.

How can this meditation help you with purpose? The feeling of being aimless comes from somewhere. From where? For one: we are put here, on Earth, but we're not told, why? It also comes from preconditioned ideas and learned expectations. A child never feels aimless or purposeless - they just live, act, play, have fun. Feeling aimless comes from when adults are taught to behave a certain way and if they don't live up to their own expectation. An adult person lives in a box constructed by their learned experience and expectations. This learned experience comes in forms of thoughts, beliefs and habits. Learned experience is useful for survival and being social, but it is also a kind of a prison. To see beyond the box, to leave this prison, you should focus on the present moment, your ""right now"" experience. Doing it consistently, your mind is allowed to be more flexible, free flowing and creative. It helps you get unstuck when you're stuck in feeling aimless. It also increases your awareness skills in daily life and helps you find activities that make you feel more purposeful. Finally, it could lead to a deeper realization that you're already a part of a larger nature and already play an important role in this world."

Meditation,fp95qwi,t1_fp950j8,1588415392.0,"That's just scratching the surface of the problems with the post.

Many of us do meditation not just for an immediate calming effect. Many of us do meditation for long term benefit of improved behavior, to overcome addictions, to improve habits, and, yes, some people meditate for eventual enlightenment. And, on the way, if you're doing it a lot, you will encounter many, many meditation sessions that aren't calming at all. In fact, they could range anywhere from feeling a total bliss and oneness with the universe to total terror and despair. And, I argue that any meditation experience is productive for your eventual goal, as long as you use it positively and do work to cultivate your focus and equanimity. You could even argue that the most painful sessions are the most productive ones because they let you practice maintaining equanimity in much harsher situations."
Meditation,fp950j8,t3_gc1ltj,1588414588.0,"If nothing defines meditation, then why have a word for it? Might as well call it, ""relaxation"" and drop the term ""meditation"" at all. In fact, you should. Because, for the majority of us, meditation has specific criteria and specific purpose, unlike what you suggest.

I think that you're conflating giving someone advice with restricting person's choices. It's the opposite. When you give someone advice on meditation, some strict guidance on the posture, on how to approach thinking, on whether to use an app, you're expanding choices for a person. Each decision has certain advantages and disadvantages, and a knowledgeable person (e.g. teacher) will give you as much pros / cons breakdown as possible rather than saying ""do whatever"".

Meditation does, in fact, have a variety of techniques and you have choice of following one, or multiple during the same meditation session. They can be categorized into a few categories (e.g. Do Nothing, Mindfulness, Loving-kindness) and broken into sub-categories (e.g. mantra, focus on breath, count breaths, noting, feel inside, feel outside, etc). There's sitting and walking meditation - those practices have their own rules that you should not violate. One crucial rule for your practice is to do it regularly. An important rule for every meditation session is to do it for a specific predefined amount of time and not leave until that time is passed. If you actually think in terms of categories and rules, they give you structure and freedom to target specific areas that you need to target. For example, you may have noticed that you've been feeling angry at someone or at yourself, that means maybe loving-kindness will help better at this point in time.

It's also useful to think about practice in terms of formal practice and micro-bursts of meditation. Formal practice is a regular (ideally, every day) sitting and/or walking meditation for a set amount of time. Micro-bursts are short periods of time where you practice mindfulness during your chores, daily activities, conversations, even during intense arguments. It's important to have both for a really impactful meditation practice.

Additionally, sitting VS. lying down VS. walking VS. standing VS. chanting (and others) meditations have their own advantages / disadvantages. For example, sitting is considered better than lying down because it naturally keeps you more alert. Similar argument goes for meditating with open eyes. Walking meditation is useful too in triggering aspects that sitting meditation cannot trigger - it helps to observe flow from another perspective.

Though I understand the sentiment that there's not a single criteria that defines meditation. That doesn't meant there's no criteria that defines meditation, it means that there's many criteria that define meditation. Of course, we shouldn't be judgemental of others' way of practicing (in fact, there's much to learn from the variety!), but we should also be more specific in our advice rather than implying that nothing defines meditation.

So, it would be more productive to say ""there's many right ways to meditate"" rather than ""there's no right way to meditate"", and provide more options to people."

They come from a place of destruction and selfishness, opposite of love and care. They come from the same place as the thoughts of anti-lockdown supporters. The trick is to realize two things: (1) all of us grow up in the society characterized by information overload, (2) the information fed to us by the media has more to do with how much emotion it triggers than with truth. Then, it doesn't come as a surprise that so many people commit emotional and irrational actions, resulting in destruction and selfishness. Do they deserve to die for growing up in a society like ours, where their opinion is constantly manipulated?

I was misled many times by certain media. Some people start doubting status quo and they start seeking media that also rejects status quo. For example, people who believe there's something wrong with the world, start searching for an answer and encounter Alex Jones. They found an explanation! They don't realize that their opinion is now manipulated just the same, just from a different angle. Navigating through this endless stream of information is really hard. How many times have *your* opinion been manipulated and is it manipulated right now?

If you seek truth, you might, on your way, be in the wrong camp. In fact, being in the wrong camp is the norm. There are people who seek truth in the anti-lockdown trump camp. That could be their current phase. If they truly seek truth, they will soon realize how wrong they were and switch camps and start isolating. They might join another camp, then another, then another, coming closer and closer to the camp (or lack of it) that best represents politics, morality, human nature. Everyone who learns makes mistakes. Do people who make mistakes deserve to die?

Not to mention, the simplest fact here: they're human. They're human and they also have loved ones. If they die, their relatives will suffer so much. Besides, can we teach those people anything if we come from the place of hate? Perhaps some of them cannot be taught anything, but even more people cannot be taught anything if we come from the place of hate rather than love."
