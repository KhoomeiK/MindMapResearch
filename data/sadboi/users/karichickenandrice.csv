GCSE,eqbkgb8,t1_eqb7ty8,1559950585.0,I feel like if itâ€™s a quotation itâ€™s okay. Its probably for people who actually swore in their writing
GCSE,eqbkaas,t3_by0noa,1559950525.0,Itâ€™s probably the stigma around it. Like sometimes i feel like a paper was easy but then too easy so i feel like u failed. But then again youâ€™ve done the exam so why waste time thinking about them if you could focus and improve on the coming ones. You probably didnt fail its just the GCSEs make it sound intimidating
GCSE,eqbjw9l,t1_eqbjjbg,1559950386.0,Sell it. Better making money than just burning it.
GCSE,eqbjqrm,t3_by1b8g,1559950328.0,I think it said compare but even if you did similar you may pick up some marks by making a link between the sources. But honestly donâ€™t stress. Youâ€™ve done it now and you canâ€™t change it. You did your best and this probably wont drastically affect your grade

AskReddit,ep7qy00,t3_brlti4,1559085262.0,"Lightdogs. Itâ€™s those timer apps that you canâ€™t go off otherwise its starts again. But what makes it underrated is that while the timer is on, you gain points to buy eggs that hatch dogs which you can breed !"
unpopularopinion,ep64d6g,t3_bu2b2x,1559064480.0,Women donâ€™t wear it as deception or for anyone but themselves. Itâ€™s like an accessory- it makes them feel more confident and good. Youâ€™re delusional to think they are doing it as a way to deceive people because that isnâ€™t the purpose of makeup. It may make them look better (some cases) but if they wanted to look completely different make up wouldnâ€™t do the job.
