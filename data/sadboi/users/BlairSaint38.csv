TheBrewery,fdsh4uw,t1_fdlmm4z,1578702641.0,"I am going through the process now. first time doing the SBA process. I am asking for $400K. I will need that for equipment. 

Questions: 

1. Is it better to ask for more than less, obviously I want the equipment used but it might not be available and depending when I have a job, this may affect it. 

2. I know the SBA guarantees 75% and then the individual guarantees 25%. - I just want to confirm it’s an individual and not your company. 

3. Typically you need a minimum of 10% of the amount your asking for in the bank correct? Or that in assets."

When I am really depressed it’s like my body is doing through the motions, but I don’t remember tasks I have done and the days run together. It can get really hard especially if you are in school. Not sure where you live, but one thing that’s has tremendously helped me in bad ruts is swimming. Even if
Just getting in the water and floating for a lap or two. Best of luck."
