You can get people committed, but they almost never keep them for any length of time. Some very ill and violent schizophrenics may be given a court order to receive a long-acting form of an oral or injectable anti-psychotic. The real key here is supervision.

BrainFog,fkzilb8,t3_fgmrik,1584671854.0,"Ritalin helped my brain fog SIGNIFICANTLY. The only problem was that I developed a tolerance to it and had to keep upping the dosage, which is not sustainable in the long term. You can try to work around it, for example, every two weeks I would go off the ritalin for a few days to a week, which would restore most of the effectiveness of the ritalin."
BrainFog,fkzi6vi,t3_fl164c,1584671581.0,"Have you tried anti-depressants? Brain fog seems to be a somewhat common, but less well understood symptom of latent depression and anxiety. I have had mixed results with anti-depressants. Some helped ENORMOUSLY, but they ended up pooping out and not responding even after subsequent dose increases. I am currently trying the MAOI Nardil, and may look to try a few more anti-depressants and supplements."
BrainFog,fkzgglo,t1_fks0048,1584670420.0,"I am in the exact same situation as you two. Brain fog, lack of motivation to get out of bed, exhaustion. I'm 25, and this started about 3 years ago. Over the course of 8 months I went from relatively normal to being completely unable to complete my college coursework. Prior to this, I was a straight A STEM student. The brain fog ""stabilized"" (if you can even call it that) at a level where I can get out of bed to eat meals, but that's about it. Doctors basically think it all has to do with some kind of latent depression and anxiety. I have tried several anti-depressants with varying results. After taking it for 9 days, prozac suddenly kicked in and improved all of my symptoms about 90%. Then the efficacy dropped off and never returned even with subsequent dose increases. Ritalin actually helped quite a bit, but I became tolerant to it and had to keep pursing higher and higher doses; non sustainable. I tried a bunch of other SSRIs, SNRIs, and some tricyclic antidepressants with basically no effects. Wellbutrin maybe did a little something, but not much. I am now trying the extremely potent MAOI anti-depressant Nardil. There are a few other options I may try, including the other MAOIs Parnate, selegiline, moclobemide, marplan, and possibly the supplement with documented anti-depressant activity St. John's Wort. I am still keeping my fingers crossed. MAOI's are said to work better against the ""atypical"" variant of depression, which tends to be marked by exhaustion, brain fog, ""leaden paralysis"" (your whole body feels heavy), and excessive sleeping."

depressionregimens,fkcqyhk,t3_fhq24g,1584059135.0,"I am very interested in this thread. There seems to be some suggestion that sigma-1 agonism is associated with relief from the ""negative"" symptoms of schizophrenia, namely lethargy and lack of motivation. I have the same problems, though mostly as fallout of depression, not schizophrenia."
Nootropics,fk58ew6,t3_ffu9kt,1583875480.0,"There is an MAO-B inhibitor(it prevents the breakdown of dopamaine) called Selegiline. It is most commonly used for parkinsons or depression. People have described it as ""adderral that doesn't poop out"". I have heard of several people who use it for ADHD. It is easily available from places like [alldaychemist.com](https://alldaychemist.com), [brandmedicines.com](https://brandmedicines.com), [4nrx.md](https://4nrx.md), etc."
MAOIs,fk2nrdr,t3_fg48mj,1583805070.0,"I could be wrong, but parnate seems to be preferred by many of the people around here who have had the opportunity to try both. Compared to nardil, parnate is said to have fewer problems with lethargy, weight gain, and sexual dysfunction. It is said to be somewhat more ""stimulating"" and less ""sedating"" than nardil, but people around here suggest that both nardil and parnate are far better at treating both anxiety and depression than conventional anti-depressants. If your doctor is already giving you nardil, it probably isn't much of a stretch to ask to try parnate for a while."

Most don't require prescription. Yeah, they are definitely legitimate, not shady at all.  The only reason I know about these is bacause other people posted them here in r/MAOIs."
MAOIs,fjqdn7c,t3_fere60,1583571556.0,Why? Aren't Phenelzine or Tranylcypromine available? I do know that moclobemide is easily available from online pharmacies with no issue.
