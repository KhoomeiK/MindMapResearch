Chris can act but god damn his accent. I could barely make out what he said but that may be just me. The action is top notch though. The director achieved what he was aiming for.
Talking about the ending, I think the director deliberately left it open ended in case the film is successful and a sequel is needed. My pick is maybe Tyler survived because he could hold his breath which was foreshadowed earlier and he wasn't shot at any of his vital organs. He takes a leap of faith in the river. And eventually he comes back to Ovi."

Also Lakshya and Swades were catered for selective audience.

Btw, I watched all these movies back in 2004 and my favourite movie of 2004 was Dhoom (Me and my friends lied to our parents and went to watch it in theater number of times). I lost count on how many times I watched that movie. I bought the CD, Cassettes, DVD and Bluray of that film. Second was Main Hoon Na.
