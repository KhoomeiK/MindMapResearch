Let me make this clear: you‚Äôre not an asshole, you just have unresolved trauma regarding your mother. You shouldn‚Äôt project your problems and trauma onto your future granddaughter and daughter. If a name causes that much trauma and emotional labor for you, therapy would be a better option than avoiding it entirely and potentially harm your relationship with your family. 
Maybe having positive connection with the name would be a good thing? Then every time you see it in unrelated moments, your thoughts will go towards your beautiful and beloved granddaughter instead of your mother. Don‚Äôt let skeletons from the past ruin your future"

You offered to pay, and he declined. He‚Äôs inconsiderate and childish. No you don‚Äôt pay rent, but you make up for it by actually taking care of the place and making sure it‚Äôs not a pigsty, but rather a livable home. That should count for something. Also, it‚Äôs not really your place if there isn‚Äôt space for your stuff, is it? How the hell would there be enough space for the friend? Get yourself a new flat by yourself sis!
I have a few questions;
How long have you been living with your boyfriend before the whole drama happened?
How long is the friend going to stay?
How come is there suddenly room enough for one more person?"

People like that need professional help and they can be very toxic, especially when you‚Äôre young. I couldn‚Äôt stand it anymore so I told my teacher who then got my friend to see a counselor, and then I just slowly detached myself from her.
