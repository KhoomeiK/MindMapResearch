ptsd,fin1ihp,t3_f8pt9o,1582553417.0,"I absolutely love that you‚Äôre comforting her and want to help- that‚Äôs rare at best and really badass. With ptsd, I‚Äôm finding that the best way to help has more to do with the individual than an overall ‚Äúprocedure‚Äù to help. Speaking with her and continuing to be there for her will help. She will feel comfortable one day telling you more but it‚Äôs scary to admit certain things. If you continue to support her, she will slowly recognize what helps her and will likely feel like she can tell you how to help best. 

The number one thing is to continue to support her through her process. Whether that means hugs or just talking or just sitting in a room with her. Don‚Äôt forget your self-care in the process. Speaking as a survivor with ptsd, one of my biggest worries is hurting others with my story or being a burden with my flashbacks/panic. Reassure her that you‚Äôre here for her and that you aren‚Äôt going anywhere, reassure her that she‚Äôs not a burden to you and that you want to help if she knows any way for you to do so.

Good luck with the relationship! I admire your ability and desire to support your girlfriend, even with the ptsd (or especially because of the ptsd). Thank you for sharing!"

I also count my fingers in sets of 8 (not obsessively, it just helps ground me).
