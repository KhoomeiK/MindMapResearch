The default option is to break up. But another option to potentially explore is polyamory. You say you need a connection in order to have sex. Would you be open to not only sleeping with, but dating other people? Would your girlfriend be okay with that, as well? Then your relationship would not only be ""open"" (i.e. sleeping with other people) but ""polyamorous"" (i.e. dating other people).

That's how crushes work in general? I mean, if you have a crush on a dude you might get your hopes up, and then he might dash those hopes, and you just have to move on. There's nothing special about this process if you're gay, I think she's just trying to manipulate you into feeling bad for her. Then again what do I know, I'm bi so I have double the potential dating pool :-D"

Omg this. Whenever I'd do something she didn't like, she would say that one of my friends pushed me into it, and that I don't have a personality or will of my own. I came to believe something was deeply wrong with me and am just beginning to resolve my identity crisis at 35."

I so identify with the combination of infantalization and intense pressure to succeed. Like no mountain I climb is ever high enough, and at the top is always nmom, ready to tell me I don't know anything.

My mom is a failed artist and has always tried to push me into the visual arts. She's always been resentful because my passion is writing (same as my dad). I'm honestly a pretty good painter and I think I avoid doing it because of her. Maybe I'll pick it up again now that I'm NC."

First, serious question: does your husband have a cuckold/hotwife fetish? This part of your post strongly hints at that. Because if your marriage is working but the sex isn't, the possibility of opening your relationship is one you might want to discuss with him.

\> I can't help but feel as if I'm married to a child sometimes.

This is the bigger problem. It sounds like your marriage isn't working on multiple levels - emotionally as well as physically. You're young and you have no kids together - why do you stay?

\>  just cant shake that I feel like my ""one"" is out there. 

For the record, he isn't. Soulmates are not a thing. But, maybe someone you're more compatible with \*is\* out there.

TL;DR open your relationship or divorce."

I am nine months pregnant with my first child and I have been VLC (very low contact) with my toxic parents for the past 5 months. Maybe a total of three texts to my dad during that time. I cut them off when I realized that they will only add to the stress I already feel embarking on this new chapter in my life.

When you have toxic parents, it is hard to realize that you can and should put yourself first. Don't let your crazy family make this special time about themselves. Good luck with the birth, OP!"
