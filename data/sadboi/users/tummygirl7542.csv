Unemployed,fjknps7,t1_fjkmwbi,1583430355.0,"Thanks for the reply! I have to keep remembering that: I don’t owe any employer and they owe me nothing as well, especially with these at-will employment laws and the fact that they have no problem replacing any of us in a hot second. Stupidly, I get my feelings involved and “feel bad” about doing what’s best for me.

I’m going to go to this place and feel it out. Most importantly, I think I need to go in with a more assertive attitude/ I’m usually so accommodating as though I should be on my knees thanking them for deigning to hire me. 

Thanks again."

Whenever I spot another black person in a white space I want to trip over myself to be best friends with them but I try to play it cool because everyone’s not a weirdo like myself and I probably scare them 😂"
BlackGirlDiaries,fjd8iv1,t3_fchgcj,1583248071.0,"I’ve found that in some instances, there are those of us who have become so accustomed to being the “only one” in a white space-whether we or not we are comfortable with it- that we feel threatened for some reason when another of “us” comes around. It’s a weird thing."
depression,fc0o3oa,t3_effx75,1577295653.0,"I made the mistake of mentioning to my mother that maybe, perhaps I could not return this afternoon for dinner because I didn’t have the energy to be around people ( I stayed over my parents’ last night but needed to go back to my place to shower and do hair and makeup). Well that was like setting off a bomb. She just kept saying “fine but I don’t know why you can’t just have dinner” and “ I’m not going to beg you to stay.” 

I didn’t want her to beg me to come to dinner. I just want for once for someone to say something like, “ I’m sorry you’re feeling like this, that sucks, I don’t know what I can do but I under of you’re not up to being “on” today.” I’m not looking for anyone in my life to “cure” me or make it all better, just acknowledgement that this thing/depression is in me and know that if I could make it go away at the snap of a finger I so, so would.

The night before, I tried reaching out to some friends about how I was feeling and the response was to turn it into a joke and then continue talking about Xmas shopping.

I really feel that all of this what seems to be a push for people to reach out and listen to friends and loved one about mental health is all for media show. Real people don’t want to go to deep when it gets real.

I have to go back to my parents’. How do I get through it??"

USMilitarySO,es969jt,t3_c684bv,1561728457.0,"Thank you everyone for the advice- no one in my life can really understand, either they think it’s crazy to commit to someone so far away or they think we would essentially be wasting 2 years of our lives so I thought i’d turn to the professionals, you all! Thanks again- I have to summon up the courage and also be prepared for him to not want to do this, which is what I fear the most- I keep thinking I could have made a better case if I had opened up earlier. Thanks again I really appreciate the responses."
