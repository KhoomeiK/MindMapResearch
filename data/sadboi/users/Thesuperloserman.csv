Yes I am right they don't have time to train, if your city has 8 cops for the city, how are you going to find a time to train them when they have to be on duty?

The Police Union, although it has police officers in it, not all Police officers get a say. Not to mention there are cases of police officers being arrested for committing crimes, so your generalization is wrong because it's not always the same.

Yes, some police officers don't have adequate equipment to do their jobs, so how do you expect them to do their jobs correctly? Just because some people don't have equipment to live properly doesn't justify them be assholes. But nice whatboutism.

You know every department and you know each individual protects bad cops? Are you sure it's not the police union that protects them? Yes cops are trained professionals, but if John from across the street comes and punches you in the face because you looked at home funny, are you not going to do anything just because he isn't a ""trained professional""? Seriously you have no clue about anything when it relates to police or first responders in general, I constantly get told by people how to fight fires who have never been a firefighter first hand. It's the same with you armchair police officers who think you know or have any idea about the situation. Do police officers have things to improve, absolutely, they could use so much training and financial help, because some departments in the US don't even have the proper resources to do their job.

Yep, Psalms and Ecclesiastes are books from the old testament. In the old testament it is known that all men and women on earth are sinners, because of the original sin from Adam and Eve, so in those texts you mentioned were in the Old testament when all people were considered sinners. The reason God sent his perfect son to be sacrificed was to pay the ransom of the original sin and allow all people a chance to reach eternal life, not just God's people, the Israelites, like in the past. A perfect person sinned, so a perfect person must pay for the sin, almost like an equal exchange concept if you were thinking physics."
MurderedByWords,f90ir4e,t1_f90exji,1574972896.0,"Your thinking of the wrong pasage, the one I'm referring to was the Man who had a lot of possessions and he wanted to follow Jesus, in that same passage it was mentioned Jesus could see he truly believed. So Jesus told him to sell his possessions and follow him, the man grew sad and left because he had many possessions and didn't want to get rid of them. You also mentioned the thief, and said he must of done something bad if he was getting executed, yet we both know many people in those times were unjustly killed, including Jesus himself. We have no actual account of that man's life, only that he was being executed for being a thief, and Jesus, seeing the good in his heart, promised that he would be resurrected. Jesus also never mentioned the rich man is never going to be resurrected, only that it is difficult for a man slaving for riches to also slave for Christ, for one will take priority over the other, and he will love one and hate the other, almost like a have your cake and eat it too scenario. Also the text in psalm and ecclesiastes are from the old testament, remember Jesus giving up his life paid the ransom for the ultimate sin of Adam and Eve, before that everyone was a sinner technically because they where born in sin. God used his perfect son to pay the ransom for the sin, because a perfect person had to pay it. And it's not just faith in Jesus, it following him faithfully as well, like I said, the explanation of following the law is that you cannot just follow something because you are told to, but you must also believe in it's cause as well. Also Acts says that both the righteous and unrighteous will be resurrected, so I'm sure there is a reason for this.
Also I'm not trying to convince you of anything, I'm simply explaining my interpretation, I don't think there is anything I could say to change your mind. Correct me if I'm wrong but you never entered this conversation to have your mind changed, correct?"
MurderedByWords,f8zyrjz,t1_f8zojwf,1574966347.0,"Roman's 3:9-end is an interesting text because it specifies that although we are all sinners, we are given a chance of redemption through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. The Robber who was getting executed had a change of heart, we cannot say we know what type of person that robber was specifically, we only know that Jesus gave him the chance of everlasting life. We can ask why? My guess is because Jesus could sense the good in his heart. Judas believed in Jesus, he saw his miracles, but let his greed get the best of him. Even though he believed in god it is well known that he will not inherit everlasting life because he didn't follow Jesus's commandments. So it's pretty known that it's not about a simple belief, but the actions you take in your life that is taken into consideration. For example the man who wanted to follow Jesus because he believed in him, and Jesus told him to sell his possessions and follow him. But the man got discouraged because he wanted to keep his stuff, so Jesus sensed he truly believed in his will, but he didn't follow through with Jesus's teachings. That explains why it isn't just the people who believe but their actions in the world.
Galatians 2:15-17
""We who are Jews by birth, and not sinners from the nations,  16 recognize that a man is declared righteous, not by works of law, but only through faith in Jesus Christ. So we have put our faith in Christ Jesus, so that we may be declared righteous by faith in Christ and not by works of law, for no one will be declared righteous by works of law.  17 Now if we have also been found sinners while seeking to be declared righteous by means of Christ, is Christ then sin’s minister? Certainly not!""
Here Paul is explaining to the Jews that just because they follow the law of land of the Jews, does not mean they are righteous, they also have believe in Jesus Christ as son of God. This is important because he is telling the Jews who believe they are righteous because they follow the old testament, while Paul is explaining to them it is not law that makes you righteous but a true belief in God that separates you.
Galatians 2:21
I do not reject the undeserved kindness of God, for if righteousness is through law, Christ actually died for nothing.
Here he explains that it is not simply the law that you follow but the belief in its good truthfully.
Would you call a man moral because he does not rape because the law tells him not too? Or is a man truly moral because he believes it wrong to rape someone?
That is the belief of God, you follow him not because you are told to, but because you truly believe, otherwise you are not truly righteous, you just do it because you have to, and that's not faith.
That's the best explanation I have for that.
Ecclesiastes 7:20 is referring to that fact that we are all imperfect and capable of sin, even those who follow God's will."
MurderedByWords,f8zcump,t1_f8z9ep8,1574959554.0,"Great questions, so the difference is growing up not knowing or ever have been taught about Jesus and still being a person with a good in the morality of the bible, or being known to have a good heart. I'll use myself as an example, I was raised without  a belief in religion at all, not because my parents didn't want to believe, but because they didn't really know about religion and didn't have time for it. They were still great people regardless, so I would consider them to be accepted by God. Denying him would be, going against the religion intentionally and showing hatred towards it. Now God knows everything about everyone, so he is the only one who can say yes or no, but the best guarantee would be following Jesus's example. That's the best way I can put it.
Acts 24:15 says ""There is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous"", So I am guessing this is where they will be separated.
Remember the prisoner who said “Remember me when you get into your kingdom.” Jesus answers: “Truly I tell you today, You will be with me in Paradise.”
So I think only God will be able to say who is truly good and truly evil. I am sure all will be given a chance at redemption, considering we all come from different backgrounds and circumstances that causes us to be the way we are today, and God would know that.
Now if you have no belief in him it's confusing and kinda dumb for sure.
I really like the question by the way!"
MurderedByWords,f8z5whu,t1_f8yxjsu,1574957244.0,"Great question! Seriously it makes me happy when someone is using text and asking questions instead of berating, I really appreciate it.

As for the text, John 11:25-26 is referring to true believers, those who follow his teachings, will be given ever lasting life. Now why did he say this? Martha asked him because her brother died, she was certain that if Jesus was there he would've been saved. So Jesus explained to her that even though he has died, he will be resurrected because he followed Jesus truthfully. It wasn't meant to say those who do not believe have no way of getting in, as a matter of fact, it's only those who deny him who cannot. If this is what you meant I apologize because I misunderstood, but I hope this gives context to the text.

Now on to John 10:7-9, here Jesus explains that those before him who claimed to be prophets of God are liars, he tells them that those who follow him and ignore the unrighteous one's who claim to be servants of god but continue to do things that go against God's will.

Rereading your comments I think I may have been confused, please feel free to explain if I missed anything. But I appreciate the questions, I think it's very important to constantly question your own beliefs to come to the right conclusions.

Jesus's response is indicating that because they have followed him, they already know the way, that's why when his sentence continues, he explains that they already know God, because they know him.

You can read the bible, they have all the passages online. If you want to grab one text and take it out of context that's fine, but this is interpreted this way because of the following text before and after. Read as well John 14:7-8 where Jesus continues the conversation with his disciples."

I don't care who you are, if you make a conclusion without evidence, you deserve to not have an opinion. Remember when a group of activists protested a murder a couple months back of a black man by a white cop, only to turn out the dash cam video showed a cop reluctant to shoot a man while he was trying to kill him. Yeah assumptions make an ass out of you and me."

And I'm not saying you can fix all your problems, but one thing that helped me was finding something I was good at. It turned out that I was an excellent dancer, even though I sucked at everything else I did. I didn't make me an immediate sexual figure but it helped. Also leave the job, I know it's not easy at all, but working a job like that, and wasting your time for them is no way to live, do what's best for you. I have seen a lot of women and men who I thought would never get married because of there looks(myself included) and a lot of them have found husbands and wives who actually love them. But the important thing is to have a personality to go along with it, you can't cultivate a personality if you spend all your time at work.

Me for example, I have a hard time getting someone to like me, I invite people out, I create social gatherings with friends. I try really hard to be nice and respectful to no avail, I'm not saying they have to like me, but how am I supposed to get anywhere when the other person doesn't want to reciprocate the same feelings to me? I can't do much but move on and try somewhere else."

In Tuxtla in chiapas, the people there are very nice and kind and hospitable despite it being the poorest state in Mexico. But in Mexico city, you find shady characters and good people like anywhere, and I've had a lot of problems with police  who discriminated me based on me being an American citizen.(My girlfriend at the time lived in Mexico city so I spent a few years there.)"

I suggest going down south to Chiapas too, very different culturally and how it functions. Especially the subways in Mexico city, jesus they pale in comparison to New York Subways. And the smog and trash is horrendous in Mexico city omg, they have rivers literally stockpiled with garbage, and train tracks that have thousands of people living on them. I used to live in Ecatepec en el cuidad de México."
