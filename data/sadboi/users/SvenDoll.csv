Either that or (this may sound silly/counterintuitive) repeat what the distorted inner monologue says. If you think blue and it says green then say green in your head too.

schizoaffective,fq37gvd,t3_gge1ep,1589063724.0,"I do get suicidal often, but when I'm trying to find reasons to not I always look at the little things to keep me going like
-i want to see rain again
-just one more day
-i get to eat a peach tomorrow
-i want to have a nice dream again
-i get to spank my husband's butt tomorrow morning lol
-tomorrow I'm going to find the perfect rock
 
Tiny little goals are what keep me going when I'm struggling. That and knowing my family still wants to see me again and knowing I have a lot left to experience. So I live for friends myself and the little things I guess? I hope this made sense"

schizoaffective,fq34no8,t3_ggeuk0,1589062966.0,"I'm not feeling emotionally well. I just faced the fact that I do use alcohol to self medicate my depressive times. I didn't think it was that bad until this morning. My husband told me I was black out drunk last night and I couldn't remember any of the things he told me I did. That's very scary and a wake up call. We talked it over and we decided I'm just going to not have any access to alcohol anymore. I take things to extremes so I guess this was just a matter of time. My husband still amazes me with his support, he didn't get angry or anything. Just gentle when we were talking about it. So that is a good thing. Hopefully this is close enough to rock bottom that my only way out is up."

schizoaffective,fpukmtk,t3_gfkhpv,1588915417.0,"I once got overwhelmed at church and hid in a closet for 4 hours. My husband called the police to file a missing persons report. When I finally left I got picked up  by a policeman. And the staring is something I get too, when I'm depressed I will just stare at the wall and sometimes not even blink for a long time. I still hide under tables or in closets when I'm desperate. I hid under our bed once. It's a bit off topic for what you posted but I just wanted to let you know you're not alone.

schizoaffective,fpshml1,t3_gex5cf,1588873622.0,"Happens to me too! I graduated college in 3 years so I always look back at that accomplishment and think ""well I did that so I must be well and faking all of this stuff, you can only do that when you're well.""
Or when my voices sound distant and far off I think that I'm just thinking they are  something I'm making up on purpose. And not to mention when people don't acknowledge that I am having these symptoms, that's the time where i think I'm faking it the worst. My therapist helped in once instance though when she said to me ""there are a lot of voices in the two adjacent rooms here, they are real and not imagined."" For some reason telling me what voices were real and not helped me feel validated because she knew my other voices were real. I hope you can find someone that will acknowledge your symptoms, because that's one of the best ways I've found to reiterate the validity of your struggles."
schizoaffective,fpozayh,t3_geascy,1588793237.0,I found myself walking around central cambridge with a butcher's knife and then realizing I needed help so (with knife in hand) i started to bang on the window of a cop car. Thankfully (and embarrassingly) one of the professors at the school my husband went to saw me on the street cuffed and sobbing and I asked him so desperately to bring my husband down and yeah it was all pretty embarrassing.
schizoaffective,fpoyfvo,t3_geex7t,1588792816.0,"It's a symptom of anxiety and far as I know, my therapist said that anhedonia and the lack of cementation into reality comes with that. A lot of the days I struggle with this it seems that I know where I'm at but i see it so distantly that it seems I'm the only real thing and sometimes not even that. My husband starts working with me on sensory projects like playing with sand or smelling some oils. It's hard to try to get past all this when you don't care but in the single moment you do care, have a plan or activity to jump on to keep the realness of the world we with you longer. You can do this!"

schizophrenia,fpik3k7,t3_gdokd9,1588642555.0,"My doctor told me something that gave me a new perspective. The goal with schizophrenia is not to make the voices disappear, but to make them no longer bothersome. I still hear voices but I'm no longer disturbed by them a lot of the time and I can kind of just ignore them. At that point in life you can do wonderous things you might have found impossible before hand. For example now I can cook my own food or take my dog on walks again. But smaller (and arguably more important) things come back too. Like your ability to care and be involved with the world."
