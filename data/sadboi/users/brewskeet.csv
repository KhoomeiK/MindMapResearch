Hun, things will get better. I have an A cup and I was constantly encouraged to get surgery. People who are good in your life will never ask you such superficial changes. You’ll be okay. You can message me anytime if you need to talk."

Anxiety,ewah1ph,t3_cngkrb,1565243532.0,I had a panic attack getting out of a parking space today. I just wanted to go home with my burrito... I blocked oncoming traffic for what felt like minutes but my boyfriend reassured me that it was only a few seconds. I feel you.
relationship_advice,ewagh6z,t1_ewag87a,1565243201.0,Things will get better. You don’t need to blame yourself or feel guilty.
relationship_advice,ewafn9z,t3_cnh87m,1565242715.0,"If it were genuine remorse she would not have thanked you for the heartbreak. She cannot pin this on you. It’s true, you two -could- fix things with therapy and more communication, but it sounds like you’ve made up your mind. And, like you said, it took her 2 months to set things right. She lacks empathy towards you and the situation and thinks everything will go back to normal,  because in the end she did cut ties with that person. I don’t like her implication that she’s doing everything she can, when really, cutting ties ASAP should have been the way to go. I’m sorry you’re going through this."
relationship_advice,ewaex9c,t1_ewae7g1,1565242289.0,This. I didn’t end up dating until college because I wasn’t interested in any high school peeps. I felt pressured to date at times but I stood my ground and hung out with people who had positive influences. I joined lots of extracurricular activities and expanded my social circle though! I know with social media nowadays it’s easier to get roped into drama. Think about who you want to be and stick with that. You will still have fun!
relationship_advice,ewaedf7,t3_cnh5ec,1565241952.0,"Holding on to the hope that they’ll both be single at the same time?! Honey that IS cheating. I think you mean to ask, “Is emotional cheating just as bad as physical cheating?” And the answer is yes."
relationship_advice,ew6s9p1,t1_ew6rwqo,1565179760.0,"It should feel great all the time, not on condition that you two are alone."
relationship_advice,ew60f7f,t1_ew602vi,1565150027.0,"You should tell him the truth. It’s going to be painful either way. Not telling him would not be saving him from anything - you’re trying to save yourself from being the bad person. Learn from this experience, find out what you want without the expense of hurting anyone and please don’t cheat again."
cheatatmathhomework,ew5zpxn,t1_ew5tg33,1565149440.0,"As a Masters of Math Ed candidate, I assure you that the math is not watered down! The program elaborates on how problems could be approached in many ways and education models that could help students with math anxiety or disability. I debated between a Masters or Applied Math and my current program - no regrets! I appreciate the human aspect of learning and teaching math."
relationship_advice,ew5y611,t3_cn0aub,1565148197.0,"If you’re asking this question frequently you already know the answer is to leave. A compatible relationship with healthy love and respect doesn’t need validation from others. You don’t even realize how long the relationship has gone because it’s such a natural part of your life. I’ve been in a relationship where I routinely asked my mom if she liked my ex, as though I was searching for a reason to stay. That relationship was toxic, and good riddance. I don’t know the details of your relationship but if it feels like you have to compromise a lot on your end, you’re talking your friends and family a lot less for the relationship, and you feel like you’re becoming a different person, then those are signs that you’re not with the best person for you."

relationship_advice,evooq8t,t1_evoof7o,1564652683.0,"Instead of communicating with you he decided to confide in someone else, who knew you two were together, and gave her the ok to make moves. He also made moves. Cheating wasn’t your fault, he was an asshat."
relationship_advice,evnxbal,t3_ckjirv,1564634149.0,"He has physically abused you. Do not downplay pushing and choking. Those are forms of abuse and they often do escalate to hitting. Uprooting yourself means you’re giving up your family and friends - further isolation will make you more vulnerable to his control. In a trusting, loving relationship, no one would ask you to delete social media. He already sounds controlling. Also, his agitated/aggravated state isn’t justified by the lack of sex, so your religious beliefs are not to blame. Please don’t fixate on his “good side” - he has a dangerous side! Take care of yourself and do not move to Indiana."
Anxiety,evnj6vo,t1_evn3x4m,1564626000.0,All the best!
