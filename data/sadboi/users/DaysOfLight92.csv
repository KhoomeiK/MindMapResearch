Many people tend to believe this also caused a rift between them and Jim Boob and there are rumors that he’s keeping Jill from seeing the family. He’s an all around bigot which alone makes him a terrible person. He also appears to be rather controlling, as evidenced by the multiple times he has grabbed his wife by the arm during a wedding ceremony and kissed (dip-style) in the middle of the processional (possessive, controlling behavior).

I had always dismissed teaching for all of the typical reasons (like you mentioned), but kept coming back to it when I considered other things. I graduated with a BA in psychology and worked a variety of education-adjacent jobs. It took me a little while to realize it’s what I wanted to do, but I kept going back to the idea and realized I wouldn’t be satisfied with anything else. 

That being said, I went in to college assuming I’d be one major, took one class within that major and was like NOPE. As others have said, you still have time! Take the first year of college or two to explore different options (you’ll likely have liberal arts requirements anyway). If you still go back to teaching after exploring other options, that’s it!"

-They’re glass (believe what you will about plastic vs glass re: cancer causing agents and whatnot) but I like glass - plastic can stain, warp, smell, etc. 
-They’re oven save in addition to microwave. Sometimes microwaving stuff gets mushy 
-There cute!! Some people might not consider this a valid pro but I’m much more likely to use something if it’s cute 🤷‍♀️ Sue me. 
-there are five of them in different colors. One for each day of the week. I jus my bought a second set for dinners and I can color code the days 😱

-a little expensive
