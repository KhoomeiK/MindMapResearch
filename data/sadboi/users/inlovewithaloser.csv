BPD,fpmhji2,t3_ge61ay,1588733213.0,"I get this!  Society seems to prefer extroverts, since they are the ones who put themselves out there the most.  I also worry about being boring when I’m not being or doing something crazy, as if I’m supposed to be some sort of entertainer for the people in my life.

Instagramreality,foxqpb3,t3_g9tuio,1588152924.0,"The problem it seems is that now all the high body standards of before are coming in to a culmination point.  You need a big ass, big boobs, thick lips, long hair, *and* a thigh gap in order to be considered beautiful.  Like whut mate.  And the only thing I can think of that brings back the “heroin chic” type of look is not so much the body as it is in having a Billie Eilish type of broody, angsty, look in all your Instagram pics. Thus why we get all these weird pics of girls looking like aliens."

Shit, this Coronavirus stuff might even be the beginning of the end of the chapter of us being known as “United States of America”.  It’s really weird to think about, cause how many of the greatest civilizations all probably thought they were unstoppable too?  And now all we have is their remains."

BPD,fo88moe,t3_g61u5j,1587591887.0,"Yes, to everything you said.  It’s a sad/scary thing for me, too.  For a while, I was doing really well in 2018 and 2019 despite my depressive episodes, but I was doing great taking care of myself and just being alone.  Then FP came in the picture and it was like... I was willing to lose ALL my hard work, self respect, dreams, personal goals, etc... all for even just a damn chance with him!  It’s insane.  It’s insane how much of myself can be lost in just one person."

My dumb ass had already been heartbroken before, and YET, nonetheless I still allowed myself to day dream and hope and cling to this guy.  One of my guy friends.  It’s hard because at the end of the day, I clearly cared more about him than he did me.  I don’t even think he ever fully saw me that way, and I was not good enough for some reason.  Fine.  I can accept I am a broken mess, but he has no idea how much I sacrificed and fought JUST to feel like I could stand equally to him in this world..... and now he never will.  All of 2019 pining was for nothing I guess.  I’m too stupid for him anyway."

Back then, it was so taboo to even speak out about anything.

BPD,fgu6k12,t3_f074w0,1581114082.0,"Yup, but people congratulating me actually worsens it for me.  (Not many, probably like my seven family & friends).  It just reminded me how much I fucking hate myself and how broken my life is and how useless once-a-year congratulations were when my problems are much deeper... then again how are they supposed to know right?  So I deactivated my bday on the few social media I have cause it’s just a painful reminder of the day I came in to this shitty world and I actually don’t want to hear any positive thing about it.  Because there isn’t."

MakeupLounge,ffpg804,t3_et26d3,1580094274.0,"Exactly.  So many people are saying they’re not excited about this, nothing original or marketing-wise.   But, what she is doing is definitely more about helping gear the beauty industry in to a more sustainable and eco-conscious place. 

I’d also argue that the whole, “gotta be exciting/new” thing about makeup is exactly what is turning it in to fast beauty.... where we need a new wasteful palette every two weeks.  I’d much rather have one or two that I can refill and customize to my hearts content.  As someone who partook in buying every new launch, only to realize how bad and wasteful it all is, this is something I will definitely support."
