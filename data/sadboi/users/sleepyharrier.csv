I don‚Äôt have trouble actually falling asleep, so I can‚Äôt help you there, but I highly recommend looking into low pracozin dosing for PTSD-related nightmares."
Wooster,fogkjko,t3_g4mshc,1587753732.0,"I‚Äôm just about to finish my first year at CoW (well, I spent half my second semester at home due to the outbreak... oh well. Also this is my first reddit post!) and I absolutely love it. I think Wooster is right for someone who is dedicated to academics (woo courses can be challenging, but in a good way!), wants a smaller college environment, and wants involved professors who really care about their students. I‚Äôve found Wooster to be quite diverse and as a lesbian, very accepting. 

My only warning would he how small the town is. I‚Äôm from a fairly large city so being in a small town environment took a bit of getting used to, but it‚Äôs very charming and full of interesting people. 
Good luck on your search! Overall I could not be more happy that I chose to go to Wooster."
