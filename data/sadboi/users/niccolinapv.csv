Anxiety,fodxvh8,t3_g6u4dj,1587692202.0,Thank you so much for sharing this. It's hard not to get alone in all this panic.
AskReddit,fnvti53,t3_g3w1uu,1587304343.0,"For finals in my Advanced Italian class in college, we had to do a presentation completely in Italian, of course. I think I retold the story of ""Frozen"", it literally could have been about anything.

This guy, who barely took anything seriously decided to talk about the song, ""Por To Volare"", sung by Andrea Bocelli. 

He touches on the Italian version for maybe 1 minute and then talks about the Spanish version, ""Con Te Partiro"". Which is also the song that Will Ferrell sings at the end of Stepbrothers. Since he likes the Spanish version better, he showed us the entire clip from Stepbrothers as part of his Italian presentation.  He did not stop until the end, so this poor professor had to sit there and listen to, ""it's the fuckin' Catalina wine mixer"" over and over again. 

TL/DR: kid played Stepbrothers scene of Will Ferrell singing the Spanish song ""Con The Partiro"" instead of doing anything in Italian for his Advanced Italian final."
