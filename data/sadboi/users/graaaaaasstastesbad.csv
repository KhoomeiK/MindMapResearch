I used to have the opposite problem (hating men because of my past) so I got to know men I felt comfortable/safe with on an individual level to help my brain comprehend that men are individuals, not a collective. Your mom and stepmom are shitty, but if you have a girl classmate that plays the same video game as you or your friends older sister that also has shit parents, that can give you something to bond over and be a bridge between seeing women as a collective vs individuals.

-you need to have extremely strong boundaries. Do some self reflection and write done ten things you would leave her if she did. The first couple are easy (cheating, hitting) but after that it gets harder. You need to promise yourself and be sure that you will leave if those things happen. Encourage her to do the same so you have a basic understanding. Having these boundaries helps, pwBPD push against boundaries cause of our abandonment issues

-have her get the DBT WORKBOOK on amazon. It‚Äôs the best seller, it‚Äôs green, it‚Äôs like $20. If she does the work in it her emotional regulation will be develop a lot quicker

-talk about her triggers, obviously at her pace, but they need to be talked about and open

-when she splits on you (and she will). Understand she will say stuff she doesn‚Äôt mean. Talk about it afterwards."

That being said, extroverts will accidentally bulldoze over your boundaries if you don‚Äôt state them. Learning how to state a boundary without being a jerk is not an easy skill for super introverted people, but it is possible. Also, learn how to give good compliments. Even if things don‚Äôt work out with her that will really help you the few times you want to be with people.

You should be in therapy that is actively pushing you to make friends.

You are a social animal (like all humans), even if you have crippling social anxiety. You‚Äôre lonely, so your brain is latching onto the first people that are nice to you and you feel comfortable with and forcing all those years of few/no friends/lovers/companions into obsession over men who are not available. You know you won‚Äôt flirt with them, so you can‚Äôt get rejected. So you found people who are ‚Äúsafe‚Äù to have feelings for (emotionally) and your brain is going wild.

BPD,flms2xq,t3_fps4y3,1585294298.0,"Welcome! It‚Äôs a shot show of a disorder to have but our community is pretty great. I know a new diagnosis can be weird or scary or weirdly validating and confusing. I‚Äôm going to give you some advice I wish someone had given me when I was 13:

-Self Care/recovery/managing symptoms is about how YOU feel. Doesn‚Äôt matter what worked for other, or how your parents/friends/significant other want you to cope.  As long as you‚Äôre not hurting yourself or others, do what you need too. I roll frozen oranges all over my arms and neck when I want to be impulsive. Does my boyfriend think it‚Äôs weird as fuck? Absolutely. But I feel better doing it. One of my friends uses a pacifier when she sleeps. Is that cringe? Yeah, but nobody has to know and she has less nightmares. Don‚Äôt be afraid to try the weird coping mechanism, and don‚Äôt be afraid to try the ‚Äúbasic‚Äù ones. Yoga has helped a lot of people‚Äôs symptoms lessen, and green smoothies can be delicious if you make them right. 

-Do not let your sadness become internalized. There‚Äôs a lot of crazy forums and chat rooms and tumblr blogs and subreddits out there that romanticize being sad or hating yourself and those places can be addicting because they make people feel less alone. But you can only get better if you push yourself to work to get better. Get that support from people who understand, but also don‚Äôt get into a community that brings you into negativity. I think this subreddit is a good mix between us expressing our emotions while still being a very supportive place.

-it‚Äôs okay if you have this disorder forever. It gets easier as an adult. Not gonna day it doesn‚Äôt suck, but it is better. Being a teenager is a heck of a time to be struggling with mental health and I‚Äôm sorry you have to experience this. 

-it‚Äôs better if you eventually don‚Äôt fit the BPD diagnosis eventually. If you manage to dedicate your self to DBT (most common therapy for BPD), and taking care of yourself, some people have gone from 5+ symptoms (you have to have at least 5/9 to be diagnosed) to 4. It‚Äôs rare, some people argue that if your able to do that then you never had BPD. 

-people play the ‚Äúpain olympics‚Äù. Oh you have BPD? I have BPD OCD PTSD GAD MDD and SAD. Don‚Äôt listen or befriend anyone who wants to compare your pain to there‚Äôs, or is always finding a way to make their pain more ‚Äúimportant‚Äù that yours. This includes people who constantly talk condescending about your pain. On the flip side, make sure not to become one of those people. I was one of those people and it cost me a lot of friendships and pain to realize what I was doing.

-Everyone‚Äôs bodies are weird at 13. Not in a bad way, your body just isn‚Äôt done growing. None of those famous teen actors actually look like 20yr olds. Body changes can be hard for people with BPD because we already struggle with identity, and to many people identity is linked to their bodies. Just know everything that has or is going to happen to you is normal and someone else has or is also experiencing it. Puberty is wild, BPD can make it a lot harder. You can get through it I promise you.

-stay away from anyone more than a year older than you that wants to date/be sexual/‚Äújust friends‚Äù. They do NOT think you are ‚Äújust so mature‚Äù and have ‚Äúan old soul‚Äù. They are creeps and you will save yourself so much time, energy, and pain if you block them. You might not have had a creepy interaction with an older man or women yet, so it might be hard to see red flags at first. BPD can make us easier people to target. Every adult with BPD I‚Äôve met has had a ‚Äúcreepy older internet ex-boyfriend/girlfriend‚Äù story. Please listen to us and block anyone who feels creepy/bad/weird/ slightly flattering but way too flirty too quickly. 

-stay away from drugs, many people with BPD are extra sensitive to drug effects and addiction. If you‚Äôre not going to stay away from drugs: Stay the fuck away from heroin, opioids, and meth. No matter what anyone ever says about them, do not do heroin opioids or meth. They will ruin your life and those of everyone around you. Don‚Äôt be a dumb ass. I‚Äôm hoping at 13 you‚Äôre not dealing with drugs yet, this is life long advice."

I just normally have the ability to see friends/go to class/go to work/etc so alone time isn‚Äôt a big deal cause most of my day is with people. Now it‚Äôs not. I don‚Äôt know how to get through this. I know I will it‚Äôs just a long road ahead.

My ex roomates were a couple and the girl could NEVER be alone (not exaggerating. I never once knew of a moment she was alone and I lived with her for a year). She would do anything and keep people around she didn‚Äôt like just so she never had one moment of alone time. I saw how toxic and bad it was for her romantic and platonic relationships. 

I feel like I‚Äôm turning into her. Not a good feeling"

AskReddit,fl86ivn,t3_fmnu1a,1584916908.0,"When I‚Äôm extraverted, cracking jokes, and friendly I get a lot of attention. When I‚Äôm tired or feeling more quiet I get noticed 75% less. 

Also if I‚Äôm wearing makeup or not thats a +/- 25% change as well. I‚Äôm good at makeup so I can make myself a decent amount better looking with it. Like if I have ‚Äúnatural‚Äù makeup and hair done I pass for 7/10, full glam right outfit I could maybe get 8.5/10, no makeup 5/10. 

The most consistent compliment I get is my hair no matter the makeup situation. When I wear a wig or have a ponytail on nobody compliments me if I don‚Äôt have makeup on.

Small stuff like that. I‚Äôm sure as a 5/10 woman it‚Äôs easier in the dating scene than a 5/10 man, but society pressure makes it feel really really shitty to be a 5/10 woman."

relationships,fl5shsm,t3_fmrp5q,1584844562.0,"Honestly I think you are worrying too much. Clearly your girlfriend likes you and wants to be with you. 

I think when you finally see her again, or maybe a bit before. Just admit that you‚Äôre nervous about the physical stuff and take it slow. Holding hands it nerve racking the first time and then the easiest thing in the world for the rest of your life.

Take deep breathes when you get there and remind yourself she likes you!! She wants to hold your hand/hug/touch/kiss!! It‚Äôs going to be wonderful! 

Try to watch a show together at the same time like it‚Äôs a movie date. FaceTime or texts each Other while your both watching it with your reactions. Will give you something to talk about and bond over. Try some LGBT shows or movies like L word and then when the spicy scenes come on just talk about it. ‚ÄúI thought it was cute when they kissed‚Äù"
relationships,fl5rhjs,t3_fmkbjo,1584843837.0,"She wants excitement, not to get in trouble. Find things that won‚Äôt get you in trouble but are exciting for her. Me and my friends were the same way at her age. It‚Äôs coming from boredom, not from an actual desire to do something illegal.

Go graffiti! Spray paint is cheap and if you find a abandon building/train cars I promise you 100% no one will care or call the police but it feels super illegal and badass without being either. Extra brownie points if you do some cheesy heart with y‚Äôall initials in it

Or just go explore a creepy abandoned place at dusk. knock a few things over to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù scare her. Jump a fence or two and be home by 11. 

Get some alcohol and go get tipsy in a field together and then fuck in the car.

If you‚Äôre into it see if kinky sex will fill the excitement void for her.

Get high and go somewhere in public or where you know cops might be (don‚Äôt carry anything on you obviously).

Scary movie marathon

Rollercoasters work great too for thrill seekers but that‚Äôs kinda hard with the virus going around.

Just come up with ideas and dates that get her heart racing and she won‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs ‚Äúillegal‚Äù or not in the long run."

relationships,fl5piwv,t3_fmkzn8,1584842437.0,"I‚Äôm a bi girl in a monogamous relationship with a man-I‚Äôm on tik tok and know the exact tiktok youre talking about. I think it‚Äôs worth noting that tiktok like these are currently a joke/trend. There are a lot of those going around in ‚Äúbisexual tiktok‚Äù community.

I can see how a immature person might laugh and send one to their partner without thinking it through realizing it could hurt their partner.

THAT BEING SAID: how she reacted to you telling her it made you uncomfortable is not okay. In a mature relationship you should be able to communicate through something like this. She is seeing her community making a joke, and when you find the joke not-funny (understandable), she is taking it as a attack on her community instead of you just not liking a not-monogamous joke.

I would start the conversation like this: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think there is anything wrong with you being bisexual, and I fully support you. I‚Äôve loved you for a lot longer than this joke and I‚Äôve never had a problem before now. I don‚Äôt like this joke because it feels not-monogamous, not because of your sexuality. I don‚Äôt think you would like it if I made a joke about wanting to date other girls either‚Äù 

IF the conversation goes well or you guys move past this just look up #bimemes on instagram and send her the ones you think are funny so she understands you support her and jokes, just not that specific one. Maybe get her a pride flag? They‚Äôre like $8 on Amazon."

relationship_advice,fk208na,t3_ffu1rn,1583790429.0,"I have BPD too along with some other stuff. I know what it‚Äôs like to have to slowly trust a therapist and how hard it is to say goodbye to one. I cannot imagine the emotions of one acting so inappropriately, and how the feeling of sexual validation mingling with the feeling of gross-this-is-my-therapist mingling with guilt about how your boyfriend would feel. Just reading this hurt I can‚Äôt imagine your pain.

Our mental states and fear of abandonment are hard enough without having to deal with someone we trust (fp?) trying to take advantage of us. But that is what he is trying to do. He is trying to take advantage of you.

A lot of these comments are harsh/direct, and I know if I was reading them I would feel defensive because they don‚Äôt understand how important and rare stable relationships are to us.

I‚Äôm sorry he is doing this. I know first hand how hard it is to see the truth when your brains in black and white and a person you trust is telling you to enjoy/feel/behave a certain way. I‚Äôm sorry for the confusion you are in and the pain. I know the highs and lows.

Please just stop going to appointments with him. 

Find a different counselor (I know the beginning is weird and awkward but there are other good therapists out there. You can find them)

please tell your boyfriend. Talk to him or write it out on a note. Have a couples counseling session with your new therapist.

Tell your support system. They will have more clear heads not fogged you by confusion, emotion, abandonment and they can help you

Self care. DBT skills. I believe in you."

That‚Äôs what I used to do and THAT is the turn off for a lot of people. Not that your highly sexual, but that I made it a part of my personality instead of just something I did.

relationship_advice,fhxrx3c,t3_f5bkuf,1581960990.0,"You‚Äôre being very very calm about this and you really shouldn‚Äôt. 

I smoke weed and have done psychedelics, I have NEVER done them around children, ESPECIALLY BABIES!!! I would never do them in the same house or come home to children high! Wtf?? I would be LIVID if my partner did that. Some people use medical marajuana and have kids, that‚Äôs different. Recreational Molly and LSD are not.

He‚Äôs bad mouthing you to his friends and has or wants to cheat on you. He is pushing your boundaries because he thinks he can get away with it and have two lives- fun drugs and sex with his friends/dealer but come home to a stable wife who raises his kids. He is living the best of both worlds right now and does not care that he is hurting you in the process. He gets to keep his moral and reputation as a family man while living like a moronic college student.

One of your children is ten. Do you really think they aren‚Äôt going to notice that Dad sometimes comes home and acts really weird? That he‚Äôs yelling and arguing with you more? That he is gone for long periods of time and is withdrawn from his children‚Äôs lives to go do drugs and ‚Äúhang out‚Äù with other women? That child is almost at puberty and if they don‚Äôt know what drugs are yet they will soon. A 13 year old with a Dad that does and loves LSD is going to think it‚Äôs a lot more acceptable than a 13 year old who knows LSD changes people and ruins relationships. I don‚Äôt know where you live but trust me, drugs can be a part of middle school if you have the wrong influences.

To me the bad mouthing is the worst part. This man is suppose to be your most supportive friend and life partner but he‚Äôs telling his friends/dealer his WIFE AT HOME WITH A BABY is ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù cause you have basic boundaries like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt fuck other people‚Äù and ‚Äúdon‚Äôt do drugs‚Äù.

Get a couples counselor if you really want to save this marriage. But if I was you I‚Äôd be getting a lawyer. 

Like I said: I‚Äôve experimented with psychedelics and it is a wonderful experience, but I would never put my marriage and family at risk for a trip and sex with my dealer. In fact I only want to do LSD with my partner, since it‚Äôs such an intense bonding experience. I would never do them around children."
