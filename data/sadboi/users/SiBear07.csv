relationship_advice,fr3cjuc,t1_fqd28qo,1589854487.0,"I disagree, he sounds like he's bordering on being emotionally abusive. In the end he still found a way to justify not saying it. Add to it the reasoning of ""past"" experience of knowing there is no point in saying to someone if they fell out of love. 

Look, this girl has waited two years to hear you say those words to her and you have admittedly said you haven't. She is literally handing you the tools to make her happy. 3 words and not some excessively jumping through hoops wish list. 

Its simple, does her happiness mean something to you? If it does then say it!"
abuse,fqxnw2d,t3_glfov0,1589735201.0,"Societal norms are changing rapidly. What was once considered ok and normal (creatively thinking outside of the box) parenting styles is now frowned upon and become the dominant narrative of ""wrong""

I once dated a man who had a 4 -5year old son still in diapers. I had already raised all my six kids who were teens at that time. I refused to change diapers again so I decided to potty train his son. He and his ex were honestly lazy shitty parents who for some reason thought he would magically decide to use the toilet without being taught how to. 

I took it upon myself to buy him pull ups and a kids potty. Everytime I had to use to the restroom Id take his son in the bathroom with me. I'd sit on my toilet and have him sit on his. Very quickly he started to learn how to use it but he learned to only pee sitting down. 

Eventually the day came to teach him to pee standing up and to use the big kid potty so id throw cereal in the toilet (its how i taught my sons) and tell him to aim at them while he peed. It worked, he was potty trained and I did not have to change one diaper and feel like the crappy new girlfriend for refusing to.

Now the point is this: I was a NEW girlfriend. He was not my kid. He was someone else's kid who had seen me pull down my pants and urinate. In order to potty train him he had to be exposed in front of me. If I had been his mother  I would have been having the biggest freak out ever knowing this. 

So the question is: clearly I meant this kid no harm and even succeeded in potty training him. But if we look at it from the perspective of a mother (if she actually gave a shit about her kid) warning bells would be ringing. She would have valid reason to freak out right? I know I would. I mean a person I dont know is naked in front of my kid and my kid is naked in front of them. I would have killed somebody and not waited for context or any explanation. 

But that's the difference of thought from back then to now. Not once did that father or mother think to say ""no its not OK"" for this new woman to train him. The common narrative was I am a woman, I am harmless and it was my job to do so."

abuse,fqxhrnv,t3_glf9zp,1589732484.0,"Please tell your father. You have worries about telling your mother and I beg of you to trust your feelings. If you tell her and get the reaction you're fearing it may prolong the abuse until something worse happens. 

This is definitely abuse. There is no question about it. I beg of you to tell your father so that you will be safe. This kind of abuse escalates and right now your abuser is testing how far he can go. 

Put a stop to it now. Do not confront him for your own safety. Let your father and police do it. I am praying hard for you. Please comment back to let us know you are safe and if you need a friend to talk to please feel free to DM. 

You deserve to feel safe and you deserve to have someone fight for you and the safety you deserve. You are not alone."

The last time I tried I ended up hospitalized for months with a fractured skull, brain injury and epilepsy as a result. That should be enough to not try again, but the hope of one day actually pulling off lingers. More so as of lately"
CrazyEx,fqrn0cq,t3_gk2t45,1589587663.0,"The part where he ""realized"" he didn't love her but still got back with her? I think you're falling for and spout word for word his bs side of the story. Its always easier to yell the crazy ex when the only context you have is side of events to mansplain her behavior. Wish ya luck madam, but hope you keep an eye out for any emotional abuse or gaslighting you might have to endure."
