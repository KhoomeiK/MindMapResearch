AskMen,ex22z6e,t1_ewymszk,1565961702.0,"Sorry for the long reply in advance but I think this  might help a lot of people with anxiety and depression. 

I’ve been working for the same company for the past 11 years. When I entered that building I started to have severe head pressure and heat, sweating, wanting to escape (actually locked myself in the bathroom to avoid people), awkwardness while speaking to others where I avoided eye contact felt my stomach tightening and just overall wasn’t comfortable with who I was or what I said. This whole concept of working in a confined space and coming to the same place and people over and over was sheer pain. 

I didn’t know at the time that it was social anxiety. Didn’t understand why I would be extremely obsessed with what I said at work and what people might have thought about my behavior. I ruminated and felt pain all over my body after work. These seemed to be something strange about how my body felt like this after taste or this venom in my body which 11 years later I realized was stress or anxiety hormones.  

After I suffered from health crisis due to panic attacks in 2012 while being stressed with work’s tremendous social anxiety and trying to get a degree I found myself in the ER more than I can remember, now I have a couple of years of memories that I can’t access due to those traumatic health scares and extreme anxiety, social, generalized and examination related. This was the first peak of my anxiety crisis 

In 2015 I went on I got promoted to this job where I have to speak to a large number of people on daily basis, especially people in authority positions. A job that people want was a daily torment to me. The sheer load of work on top of how difficult it was to do the tasks without any experience, adding to that the tremendous social anxiety, performance anxiety, generalized anxiety, my depression and past trauma being a repeated sexual abuse victim when I was a teenager and growing up with an emotionally abusive mother, being a child of poverty and father abandonment, all of that bombarded me psychologically.

I hit despair more than I can count. I thought that death is the only way out. I saw few therapists that I didn’t trust or didn’t have the intelligence to treat me as an intellectual, just writing me pills and sending me to a psychologist. I decided against medication, maybe because I feared the health consequences since I was having healthy anxiety crisis every day. I didn’t drink either. 

I kept standing, I didn’t buckle under all of this, because the child in me who suffered in the past needed the life that I promised him, the life of getting out of misery and doing something purposeful. I lost my spiritual ground because I developed religious phobia driven by a strong fear mortality caused by the 2012 health panic attacks. 

In 2017 onwards and amid all of this, a question kept nagging me. What gives power to all of these anxiety triggers? Why am I terrified when I meet my boss? Why do I fear entering the work building? Why do I get nervous meeting my work team? Why some people don’t make me anxious at all? Why some places at work or the mall nearby my house (where I had a panic attack few times) or some time during the night all make me anxious why others didn’t? 

I started writing extensively, just free writing what comes to my mind trying to answer these questions and I started making lists of what makes me anxious and rate them. 

I discovered that what makes me anxious is specific people, specific places, specific thoughts and subjects. 

Then I read about CBT on my own and I understood the basic idea of it. Unhelpful thoughts cause negative emotions. And unhelpful thoughts are brought up due to unhelpful beliefs installed in you by years and years of bad parenting, bad schooling, bad social constructs, and most importantly bad mental chatter that drips day after day year after year and form this pool of tar in your mind where all of these negative or dark thoughts come from. 

With CBT a revaluation came to me, which is hidden beliefs give these triggers the power to bring on anxiety as a reaction. It’s not just about thoughts. For example I automatically get an anxiety response in specific places in the company even when there is no one around. I called that contextual anxiety, or anxiety that is triggered because something happened in that place that caused anxiety before, not because of something that is happening now. Same with depression, some places, songs, people, thoughts, tv shows and what not all can trigger a depression response. 

I became a personal detective trying to unravel these beliefs, which is not easy to do. They’re hidden and you can’t access them, but you can access thoughts that pop in your head from time to time. So whenever a negative thought pops in my mind, I take note of it whenever I catch it. Then it became a habit to do so. I noticed that there is a repetition in these random thoughts surfacing, and they seem to solidify some belief underneath. 

A meditation mental tool called “noting” helped me here a lot to do so. I note or label the thought or the feeling. I merged that with CBT, so I will label and challenge the negative thought in my head or while writing. 

I kept on digging to what sort of belief would make me think “I would never be able to pull off that presentation” or “my boss thinks I’m useless and be will replace me soon” or “I can never become anything in the future” or “there is nothing in the future but death and a cold winter of loneliness”. 

Low self worth was a belief that I unraveled. Self hate was another, or rather being deserving of misery (because I hated myself as a child and a young adult for a very long time), being not good enough, not being smart enough, being ugly, being watched all the time, and so on. 

The more I documented the anxiety events in my life especially at work and linked them to those beliefs the more I saw the patterns and created this mental network of what causes what. 

Then I was able to predict what would an anxiety event cause in advance and what sort of belief would be activated. Self talk at the moment when the anxiety is activated doesn’t help, but riding the wave until the event is over and then doing the analysis work (takes 10 minutes or a bit more) of what was the event, what were the thoughts and beliefs associated and what were the mental, physical and behavioral consequences were was more important than surviving the event. 

I noticed with time that the triggers became weaker than they were a while ago, and gradually some of the triggers just faded and became nothing to worry about. 

I recently came up with a list of 24 people who make me anxious, 3 places at work that are hot zones of anxiety and auto trigger anxiety, which made me think this building is not that bad, 24 people out of 700 people and 3 places out of 6 floors is something I can deal with one trigger at a time. 

CBT works. Exposure works. But you need to have absolute clarity about what you’re fighting here. List the triggers down. Rank them 1 for least awful 10 to panic inducing. Figure out what sort of belief inside you gives that trigger that power. 

Doing just that is not enough. You will need to face that trigger working from the least anxiety inducing to the worst in small timed and controlled experiments. Do that with your spouse or a friend or someone you trust. Journal what you felt before during and after. Keep doing that for a while and you will just know what is what and why is why. 

When you go with the mentality of facing your fear rather than trying to avoid it, your body response is different. Doesn’t mean you will just beat up your anxiety with your strong will, I doubt that works, but you will need to endure the pain and sit with it, prevent yourself from running way or using coping mechanisms (I put on earbuds, sit near the door of a meeting room, avoid eye contact, avoid going to floors in the building, avoid meeting my boss and my team and other specific people). 

Gradually you will strip all those triggers from their power."

Anxiety,ewvwsho,t1_ewvf8eb,1565815605.0,"Same. Until I started to actually work on myself trying to answer this question that kept nagging me. What gives a trigger the power to cause anxiety? 

With time I discovered that the more I worked on unfolding this mystery the more I understood my triggers, the unhelpful beliefs that gives them their power. 

For example I fear my boss. I discovered that people with social anxiety fear authority figures. Then I discovered that it's because we fear judgment and these figures are the ultimate judgment figures. Then I discovered that fear of judgment comes from fear of rejection. And ultimately I found out it's all because I didn't have enough self worth that I wouldn't need any judgment or approval from anyone except myself. 

Now instead of avoiding triggers, I work on building my self worth with affirmations and defying negative thoughts.

religion,ewuqcrv,t3_ce03jd,1565789058.0," 🏵️ Islam is very simple. Basically you believe in a higher creator of this universe and you treat people well. That's about it. 

As with any other religion, people overcomplicated the simple message of the religion with political and social constructs designed for their own gain, since it is really easy to control the masses with faith. 

Yes there are controversial subjects in the religion, but these subjects used to be debated in the past, until a small group of really rigid thinkers made the simple of act of autonomous thinking and questioning a taboo. 

Back to your point, a big supporting historic fact is that people of other faiths and Muslims enjoyed harmonic societies with no civil wars or any sort of social nonesense. People traded and socialized freely. That is always encouraged by the faith. Yet politicians usually are those catalyst of social distortion to serve their own needs, and hence we started to see conflicts among people of different faiths and even people from the same faith, namely in the Islamic society itself."

I always remind myself, unless I killed someone or started a war and global refugee crisis or sold drugs to kids, I'm alright. 

If you have social anxiety you will feel guilty for everything you say to people. 

The cure is to learn how to be yourself, speak your mind and not feel bad about it. Learning how to be socially diplomatic is important too so you can speak your mind without offending people.

If your guilt is about things you have done that you worry will come back and haunt you, it helps to write them down. I'm assuming you maybe had religious upbringing which have guilt baked right in. God sees everything and bad things will happen if you did something bad. 

My advice is to keep a running list of things that keep you guilty, and rank them from a scale of 1 to 10. Then write down why you think you are guilty about that thing, and work on systematically challenging the beliefs that cause the guilt. 

With time you will notice patterns, same guilts keep coming up, and with time as you challenges the associated beliefs that they score less in the future.
