The Sanguine have been in Shia'at for 15,000+ years, so they have had the time and intelligence to establish a decent human population in their land, as well as trade agreements with other countries. Shia'at is also largely a slave country, with most rulers being slave traders/masters and most towns/cities having a large slave population. Cities do have human breeding farms for food production, and tend to not feed outside of the ""cattle"" they breed, so most mortals generally feel safer than one might think. If one were to go to a smaller village or roam the wilderness alone, they will most likely become a snack for a feral Sanguine, or even get caught by slave traders to be bought off in the Shia'at capital.

Or both, I dunno man, I'm scattered as fuck rn.

Anyhoo, I did some research a few years back on how long it takes certain drugs to be out of your system, and if I remember correctly, meth can take anywhere from 16-72 hours to be cleared from your system, depending on the things I stayed above. So if you only used a small amount, like a point or so, and you hadn't done it for some time before using, then it stands to reason that you'll be in the clear by Tuesday for urine definitely, blood however may take longer to clear than urine. However I'm just speculating.

That's not to say that everything taught at university has be accepted as fact and the only truth. But I believe that things that are taught at university are the closest we'll get to the truth of things in terms of objective, evidence based, scientifically explored and calculated conclusions of the the multitude of subjects they teach. Not sure if that made sense, I'm trying to steer clear from using the word ""fact"", because some people debate that facts are subjective, therefore not being able to claim fact as actual fact, but rather just another theory to add to the countless others that will most likely never arrive to a conclusion that everyone agrees can agree upon.

There's always going to be a part of me that wants to work in the funeral industry, however I feel I will find just as much fulfillment being a Death Doula, not mention it'll be a lot easier to pave my way and find my own place in the death industry. I don't know if it's like this everywhere in the western world, but in the city I live in, it's basically impossible to find work in the funeral industry if you don't already know someone in it. All of the funeral homes here are family owned and operated, and from my experience they tend to be wary of anyone they don't know who wants to work in the industry. I got lucky when I was teenager and scored work experience at a prestigious funeral home, but the owner was a horrible man who tried to force me into doing something that was unfair and cruel to me, which caused me to give up on my dream and find something else to be passionate about. It took me 15 years of aimless searching to realize that I am supposed to work in the death industry, it's my calling, and now that I'm older, wiser, and stronger, no one is gonna stop me from doing what I'm meant to do!"
death,fjaz9zo,t1_fjam089,1583183443.0,"Aaah! That makes sense. I'm Australian, not sure if that makes any difference. I did a semester of German language and culture at university  and I did pretty well during the semester. But lack of keeping up with learning caused me to forget most of what I learnt, save for the odd word or phrase that has stuck with me. The other languages I tried to learn was both teaching myself from online sources  and finding a tutor online to teach me via Skype. But neither of those were very effective. I'm not sure if its because I haven't found the learning method that works best for me yet, or if I'm just someone who can't learn languages. I like to think I'm pretty intelligent and quick to learn almost everything, given I apply myself. But when it comes to learning a language, I feel like a complete idiot haha. The only language that I was successful in learning and being able to write and read fluently was ancient Runic, or Norse runes, which I know isn't really an actual language but I could still write full sentences and read whatever I found written in runes. 

I do definitely want to learn Latin! My friend has offered to teach me everything he knows, and I do have a very basic understanding of the language and how it's written and spoken, mainly due to playing multiple video games and watching multiple shows/movies with Latin in them haha 

Maybe I can only learn dead languages hahaha"
death,fjamug6,t1_fjacdcc,1583176591.0,"Wow, I completely fell in love with everything about that phrase! It really relates to how I see myself and how I see life, and how one can find happiness in one's life without having to go too far looking for it. 

Although I believe that depression is a very real and serious thing, and happiness can seem an impossible feat for one who is severely depressed, (I know from personal experience), I also truly believe that happiness is something you already have inside you, all you need are the right tools, the right resources, and the right influences in your life to unlock it.  Anyone can feel happiness as long as they know how to find it. Unfortunately fewer and fewer people are being taught how to find and unlock our inner happiness. So a lot of people stay stuck in their misery and believe they can't do anything about it. With mental illness there is a fine line between what can be treated with traditional medical methods, and what can be treated simply by learning to rewire the brain. It all depends on the individual, I imagine. I'm no psychologist or anything, but I've lived with mental illness for over half my life, I've done a heap of research, and I like to think my personal experiences have given me a better understanding of the mind and its complexities. Or at the very least, my own mind, which is a big feat in itself haha

But I digress! Again, I resonate with this phrase, and there's a huge part of me that feels the urge to get it tattooed. However I can't help but that might be cultural appropriation on some level? As an anthropology major, I try to be as respectful as possible towards other cultures. What are your thoughts?"
death,fjallih,t1_fjakcj4,1583175887.0,"Oh nice! I really want to learn other languages, I believe being bilingual can give one of better understanding of other cultures, and even life itself.

I've tried to learn German, Italian, and Japanese, but I've always had trouble with remembering how to speak and write, I've been told I have great pronunciation but that's about as good as I get when it comes to learning new languages haha I guess some people have a knack for learning them and some don't? Or maybe I need to find a better teacher haha

Thanks for that tidbit of info! I didn't come across that in my research, interesting! And thanks again, I love that said it will rot with me in the grave.

Oh! I absolutely love learning about other cultures, I am an anthropology graduate after all haha

What does ""tat tvam asi"" translate to? What language is it? How long has it been around? Is it something that is often spoken in your culture? What does it mean to you? 

Sorry for the multiple questions, I just freaking love any and all culture. It's what makes us so special as human beings.

death,fja8fu4,t1_fj9bv4s,1583168501.0,"Thank you so much! What you described is exactly why I want to become a Death Doula. I truly believe that my personal experiences with death and dying have given me the ability and the opportunity to help people see death as something other than what it is considered in society: something to be feared and not spoken about unless absolutely necessary. The taboo surrounding death is incredibly ironic. Because it happens to everyone and should be something we can all learn to be comfortable with and talk about easily and freely. I am so excited to help guide families through a very intimate and sacred experience. I hope I'll be able to provide an experience that can ease the pain of their loss and help them to accept and embrace the process of death and grief. 

Thank you for your work in the funeral services! I admire everyone who works in the death industry. It definitely takes a special kind of human to be able to work effectively in this field. The only funeral experience I've had outside attending them was when I did a couple of weeks of work experience as a teenager. Unfortunately certain things happened that caused me to quit and I gave up on trying to get into the industry. I started trying again about 2 years ago. But I quickly learned that most funeral homes (at least in my city) are all family owned and operated, and generally don't employ people outside of their circle, unless one has all of the required qualifications and knows at least one person in the industry. After 2 years of trying to get my foot through the door, and getting absolutely nowhere, I gave up again and looked at any other ways I can work in the industry. As soon as I found out about Death Doulas, I knew that is what I was meant to do! However I am really looking forward to working with my local funeral homes (except one, the one I worked at as a teenager, the owner is a horrible man), and building a rapport with them! So again  thank you for your service!  And for allowing women the space and opportunity to get ahead in the industry! Much respect to you!"
death,fja6w26,t1_fj9jr63,1583167611.0,"Awesome! It's comforting to know there are others who see death the way I do. A lot of people in my life don't understand my perspective on death, but most people find the topic of death and dying uncomfortable, so I can't blame them really =)

I am so so glad I found this sub!"
death,fja6lrq,t1_fj9x6pz,1583167446.0,"Yes! You are absolutely right. I did a lot of research on the phrase and came across a few different translations, but only with slight differences in the wording. Plus, my tattoo artist is fluent in Latin! And he was able to give me the literal translation, as well as confirm the correct spelling for me =D
But personally, I like ""remember you must die"" the most out of the translations I did find =)
And thank you! I love it!"

IncelExit,fja5ugg,t1_fj9fe1t,1583167005.0,"True that. However, generally, what they were trying to convey is unfortunately true from my personal experience: women generally only go for men they are instantly attracted to. From my studies, I've found that it all seems to stem from a deep, deep rooted indoctrination through mainstream society that the only people are worth any kind of time, or energy, or effort, or even respect, are the people who are deemed physically attractive and desirable by that society. 

The celebration, obsession, and even worship of celebrities in this day and age has further perpetuated the ideology that being beautiful is the be all and end all of life, and the only thing to strive for, apart from being famous. And it basically is, because that's what society has molded all of us into believing for the last 100 or so years. 

Everything we believe about beauty and what is considered beautiful has been drilled into our heads from an early age through television, advertising, music, and literature that has all been dictated and controlled by people who want the majority of the human race to be so focused on superficial bullshit like appearances, that we don't notice what the people in control are really doing (hint: they're not doing anything good).

Okay I'll stop there, because that is a whole other ball park and not relevant to the topic at hand. Well, it kinda is, but not at all helping what I'm trying to say.

I know I kinda went off the deep end, but this subject really riles me up and I can get quite... passionate.

Anyhoo, to answer your question about broad shoulders making women horny. It has been scientifically proven that generally women are automatically attracted to men with certain physical features. Same goes for men being attracted to women with certain features. For men it's generally being tall, having broad shoulders, muscles, and a dominant demeanor. For women it's generally wide hips, large breasts, ample butt, feminine features and a soft demeanour. This automatic attraction to these features has been explained from a biological perspective. It all comes down to our DNA. We are biologically wired to be attracted to those that we feel can provide for us. And it can be traced back to the earliest homo sapiens, even our ancestors. Back in hunter gatherer days, these features of men And women were considered the most attractive. Not due to sexual desire, but the need to find someone who can provide for us. The male features showed women they could provide safety, security, survival, food, shelter.  The female features showed men they could provide and raise children, also gather food, they could make clothing, and everything women did in that age. This was the foundation of attraction. It's since been insanely distorted but at the end of the day, it's still prevalent, even if it's subconsciously.

Having said all that, life has become a lot more complex in the last 50,000 or so years since the hunter gatherer days. So the laws of attraction have changed. And even though we still have that foundation for attraction written in our DNA, there are copious other variables to take into account to determine the kind of person one is attracted to. And it all comes down to the individual and their personal tastes. That's why some people are attracted to you and some aren't. We no longer need to rely on only whether or not someone can provide for us as to whether or not we find them attractive. We're not hunter gatherers anymore, so we can find other aspects of another person to determine attractiveness. Which, again, is subjective. Every single one of us are very complex creatures. And you'll be surprised how much our biological and social history affects how we interact with one another today. Not to mention every other aspect of our lives. 

Sorry, I'm rambling. It's almost 3am and I'm wired. Hope all this makes sense and I'm happy to read and consider any aguements opposing what I've written. However everything I've said hasn't been copied and pasted from Google. I learnt all of this through my degree in cultural anthropology, which is considered a science, and I thoroughly believe in scientifically proved facts about, well, anything really. But I'm always open to receiving anything opposing what I believe that can be scientifically proven."
IncelExit,fja0k6d,t1_fj90ryo,1583163822.0,"I can understand your point of view.

Admittedly everyone has different opinions on love, sex, and commitment. Sorry if my wording implied that I think sex is lame, because I don't think that at all. Sex is amazing, it's the most fun an adult can have imo. However from my personal experience, sex with someone you love and trust and are committed to is exponentially better than sex with someone who just wants you for your body. I had my first one night stand when I was 28, and although it was fun and thrilling and all that, and I found the guy attractive and we got on well enough, it still felt empty and pointless. Not to mention I found out afterwards that the only reason the guy had sex with me was because he had a fat fetish. That didn't help my self esteem.
I had a few other one night stands after that, but they weren't enjoyable because I could tell that the guys were only having sex with me because they were desperate, and wanted to get their dick wet and had no other options, among other things. One guy even admitted that to me afterwards. So yeah, I've had sex, but at times it made me feel worse after than I ever did before. I've slept with 8 men in my life, and only 2 of them wanted me for me, because they were actually attracted to me. The rest were because they either had a fat fetish, they were desperate enough, they pitied me, or they were too drunk to notice how fat I was. 

I don't know which is worse, not being able to get laid at all, or having sex but knowing the other party is only doing it because they feel obligatedor because you are a fucking fetish to them.

Personally I would have preferred to not have sex at all, because those men who slept with me treated me like I was nothing but an object to be played with, which damaged my self esteem and confidence for a time, (excluding the 2 men I was committed to).
The point I'm trying to convey is that just because one is able to get laid, doesn't mean it's enjoyable. 
Personally, after my experience with the hook ups and being told guys will only ever fuck me out of pity or desperation, I much prefer sex with someone I love and trust, and have a connection with. There is nothing better on this earth.

So you say that Chads are winning cuz they can get laid easily purely because of their looks, but I think they're the losing party because yes they may get a heap of pussy, but how often do they find a woman they have a true connection with? How often do women look at them for who they are on the inside and appreciate them for that? How often do they get to have sex that gives them an emotional and soul connection? My guess is it rarely happens, if at all. I've spoken to a lot of people about mindless hook ups vs sex with a romantic partner, and 90% of them (both men and women) prefer the latter. I can't stress enough how fucking transcendent and incredible it is to have sex with someone you share a deep love and connection with that goes beyond the physical. That is what everyone should strive for in this life regarding love and sex.

It's easier for women to get sex than it is for a man, as you know. I may be a woman but I'm not blind to the hypocritcal sexism that can be perpetuated by men and women alike regarding sex and how easy it is to get it. 


Yes, Chads are automatically desirable to a lot of women due to certain physical features. Personally though, I've never been automatically attracted to tall, broad shoulders or the like. In fact, before I met my partner, my type was short and thin. Now I know that I don't even have a type, because I may be attracted to someone physically, but if their personality doesn't match up with mine, all sexual desire goes out the window.

I'm sorry if anything I said has upset you or if you think I'm trying to invalidate your experience or your beliefs. That's not my intention at all. The perception of life, specifically love and sex, is all subjective and comes down to personal experience. I'm really sorry you've had such a shitty experience thus far, leading you to believe what you believe about yourself and the mechanics of other men and women. But I just feel the extreme need to try and stress to you that you have every reason to have hope that you will find someone. Whether you're just looking to get laid, or if you're trying to find the one woman to spend your life, whatever you're looking for, I truly hope that you find it. Because everyone deserves to love and be loved, to desire and be desired. And the women who are actually worth your time are the ones who have the ability to see more than just your appearance. I know you think they don't exist, but I am one of them, so if I exist then others do too."
death,fj9008i,t1_fj8y11o,1583127253.0,"Thank you! And awesome, do you enjoy working in a funeral home?
I spent years trying to find employment in funeral services. Unfortunately nothing came of it, but I still wanted to work with death and dying, so I'm currently studying to work in palliative care then will eventually become a Death Doula!"
IncelExit,fj8zj8x,t3_fc34be,1583126808.0,"I fully believe that you can totally find someone who finds you attractive, regardless of your physical features. Yes, physical attraction does play a part in finding a romantic partner. But it's not the be all and end all. A handsome face and hot body can only get you so far. It might get you laid, but it won't help you to find a lasting romantic relationship that fulfills your life. I know a lot of incels are adamant that women only go for ""chad"" types, but that couldn't be further from the truth.

I was attracted to and fell in love with my ex, and was with him for a decade. And you know what? He had a receding hairline, huge forehead, rotting teeth, he was 5'7 (I'm 5'9), he has super thin, very weak physically, and he was pretty bad in bed. But I loved him with every inch of my being because he had more to offer me than looks and sex. We broke up for other reasons, mainly because he stopped putting any effort into the relationship and practically ignored me unless he wanted sex. And funnily enough, shortly after we broke up I met an incel who had very very recently ""ascended"" (I think that's the name of it). He had lost his virginity just a couple of months before meeting me, at age 20. He had been bullied and called ugly and fat his whole life. He has a baby face, and wide hips which gives him a feminine physical disposition. However he's 6'1 and still has some weight on him so it balances out a bit. I just wanna say that although he is 6'1, that didn't increase his chances with women because of his face and body type. He also has a birthmark on his face that women found unattractive. Because of his lack of luck with women, he decided to throw himself into working on his personality and other aspects of his life. Then he lost his virginity (they were both drunk and it was a one night stand), and then he met me. I wasn't super attracted to him when we met (it was online, we didn't meet in person until 6 months later), but as time went on and I got to know him, I fell head over heels in love with him. That was 4 years ago and him and I are planning our wedding this year. I look at him now and I don't see the feminine body or the birthmark, I don't even notice his strong body odour or anything else that might be deemed unattractive to others. I see him for the amazing human being he is, and I look at him and quite frankly, I want to jump his bones every day. I find him so incredibly sexy and I don't want anyone else. Regardless of the fact that there are guys deemed more attractive than him. I don't give a shit about looks, I care about how someone makes me feel. That's more important than physical appearance. And there are women out there who feel the same as me. Sure they might be few and far between, but they do exist! You just need to find the confidence to get yourself out there and show yourself to be someone who can offer a woman so much more than a handsome face and a hot body.


And on a side note, I don't know how you feel about female incels, but before I met my ex, I was one. Because I am deemed unattractive by society's standards. I'm tall, obese, no curves, saggy boobs. I also have multiple piercings and tattoos and tend to dress in baggy outfits because I hate showing my body. So for years i worked on becoming the best possible version of myself in terms of my personality, as well as working on my confidence and self esteem. I learned that these things come from within, no one can give them to you, and it's entirely possible to increase your confidence and self esteem by placing value on yourself in terms of what you can offer the world other than physical appearance. Because that shit withers and dies in time, but who you are as a human being and the things about you that helps bring fulfillment in your life and others lives will be what people love about you!

Sorry if all of this doesn't make sense (haven't had much sleep) or if it upsets you, not my intention at all. I just really really want to help you to believe that all is not lost and there is so much hope for you. If you need or want to chat further about it please don't hesitate to PM me!"
