kayakfishing,fpsxxwi,t1_fpsw2qb,1588881496.0,"Nice! Good luck with your degree - i wish i could go back in time and build mine around fishing and nature.

Here is some more info on this whole deal from [Bass Master](https://www.bassmaster.com/blog/how-not-hold-hawg). The guy even acknowledges that when he was first told about how to hold bass - he got offended. I did the same thing when someone told me about how to hold bass. 

I know it's a weird thing that goes against our childhood of watching guys in bass tournaments yanking monster bass out on stage all willy nilly, on top of the fact that 90% of  the guys holding big bass in picture are holding them in a way that could potentially kill the fish -  so I was trying to be as clinical as possible with my explanation."
kayakfishing,fpsvs7w,t1_fpsu5xt,1588880453.0,"Holding them this way does more harm because it strains a part of the fish where  a lot of very important muscles for feeding are - the operculum fulcrum point. When you hold the fish by the the lip like that (not holding the fish vertically) the weight of the body of the fish is pulling it down and causing the strain while your hand holds the head up.

It's worse with bigger fish, because they are heavier, so i'm sure this guy is ok.

If you look at your picture, the highest point of that fish in the picture is around the ""fulcrum point"" I am talking about. The fish only really gets into that weird position if you hold it that way. This strain is worse than the hooks set, the fight, and the lift to the boat because it is putting pressure on a specific part of the bass that is very important for feeding.

Think about how you would break a pencil in half - you wouldn't be able to if you dragged it around by its eraser, or picked it up by the eraser.

I hope that makes sense - the diagram link i posted is honestly a good explanation for you.

If you eat em? Who cares. Although hey, maybe the happier fish do taste better!"
kayakfishing,fpsrvwt,t3_gf8psm,1588878570.0,"Nice fish! 

I'm going to that guy here, so i apologize, but you gotta make sure you don't hold em that way. I'm sure he'll be fine but this is a helpful [guide](https://news.orvis.com/fly-fishing/pro-tips-stop-lip-grip)."

sales,foyyfek,t3_gaalvw,1588181497.0,"I'm an AE but i think my BDR is going to explode one of these days. His manager just clipped a meeting from his number because before the meeting he pinged me and asked if i wanted to join, because it was with someone in the same organization of an opp i'm working. Meeting went fantastically. 

She shadowed it (without asking me, or changing her name in Zoom to something like \*mycompanyname\*) left halfway through, and her only contribution was saying ""BDR\_\_\_ , you need to mute your slack."" 

My main concern for BDRs now, is that BDR managers are typically losers/useless jerks. I had 1 good one where i started my SaaS sales journey, but he moved out of the role and is actually a VP at the company I work at now. He is the exception to the rule.
