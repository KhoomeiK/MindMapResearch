&#x200B;

1. Ive had sex dreams from very disgusting things also including my same-sex friends and family even... and waking up ""horny"" is just wrong because most young guys always wake up with boners because of testosterone peaks in the morning.
2. Stories like the one you are reading about, which you shoudlnt in the first place, are ALWAYS leaving out important parts. For ex. He is bisexual to begin with but couldnt for whatever reason be with guys until then. There is literally a 0% association between headaches and being bi, lol.
3. You SHOULD go out and enjoy yourself. A date doesnt have to lead anywhere and if anything it will take your mind off HOCD a bit. I started dating my long time ex back in 2011 during my most intense HOCD period and although there were some issues like i couldnt focus on enjoying myself 100% and it was a bit of a burden sexually.. but all in all it did feel like i was back to my old self for a while...
