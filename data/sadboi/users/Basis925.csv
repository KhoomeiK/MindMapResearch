I think everything should be taken caae-by-case. If there is a decline, slowly open up. If it's getting worse, then stay closed and return to the drawing board.

We have a value problem and secondary consequences to the lockdown. The value problem on the surface appears to be life vs. money, which is incredibly oversimplified. No one in their right mind is going to say that the economy is worth more than Granny's life. That being said, reports of child abuse and domestic abuse are increasing significantly. That is a huge issue and we cannot continue to pretend that it isn't a result of the lockdown. Lots of folks are freaking out about how to feed their kids and pay their bills.

So, here we are fighting with fear and virtue. Not our best moment as a people, but the current data is much better than the grim projections and the recovery rate is good. Despite our quibbling and frustrations, I think we've done a fairly good job as a nation combating this.

For data collection purposes, if people at a local level democratically want to open up, other areas can use their statistics to gauge openings. The NYC consensus seems to be more lockdown, but drawing a comparison with a sparsely populated Montana or Wyoming is unfair and maybe even unreasonable."

This country is so huge though. Grateful to have trekked most of it. I really like Western Montana, Southern Utah, Southwest Texas, and Southern Oregon. IMO, those places have the perfect balance of population and geological attractions. Alaska is gorgeous, but too rural and too far removed, for me.
