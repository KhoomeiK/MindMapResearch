My brain doesn't work correctly, it doesn't produce the chemicals it should in the quantities needed.  Similary autism is caused by issues in the brains makeup.  As a person with bipolar, we come in all varieties under the sun.  We all aren't homicidal serial killers.  People with autism are treated with their own set of stereotypes.  Usually founded on traits that are towards the far end of the disorder.  Fortunately, autism has a very broad spectrum that generates many opportunities for research on every aspect of the disorder."

The cars are priced in the $15 to $20 range and are pretty mush disposable.  Stay away from the Mario and the other cartoon type cars.  They don't handle.

When a car does break, tear it down for parts, guide pins wear out, tires do also.  If the motor is good keep that and the gears are good keep those.  The pinion gear on the motor is a weak link.

If you are setting up with kids in mind, no loops.  They are flimsy at best and break if fallen on.  Bridges fall into the same category as loops.   No crossovers, kids love crash up derby.  You can use rubber bands on the controllers as a way to limit top speed.  Around three wraps under the thumb control should be good.

However, the topic is what was the most f***ed thing a SO did.  I am pretty sure my case falls into that parameter.  I have paid for my mistake.  It cost me monetarily, mentally, emotionally and multitudes of other ways.

Maybe my story will help someone else.  It could never help you.  You are a small, bitter person.  I bet you only post negative comments in hopes that it will make you feel better about your miserable existence."
