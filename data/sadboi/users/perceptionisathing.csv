AskReddit,f80unlr,t3_dyfdkn,1574138807.0,"I mean, rock and roll isn‚Äôt super unpopular. The case in matter would be that it‚Äôs just not as mainstream as it used to be. 
Most rock artists these days are probably more so in the underground part of the music industry. I could be wrong though. And perhaps the alternative music culture has taken its course and appealed more to audience. I mean, you have alt-rock music. That genre is most certainly on the rise because of the Sirius  XM radio, I think. 

Plus, there‚Äôs still hope for Rock music out there. King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard released a metal album this year, which from some of what I‚Äôve heard of it, it sounds pretty retro and is such a banger. Would definitely recommend. 

Anyways, I feel as though the common media‚Äôs music taste is just falling through in pop culture. 

I don‚Äôt know why pop artists are making so much crappy and repeated music that‚Äôs so unappealing, yet people are STILL drawn to them. Then again, can‚Äôt judge them, because I wouldn‚Äôt be happy if they judged me for liking psychedelic rock music. 

And speaking of mumble rap. I don‚Äôt understand it. 

Rap music these days just isn‚Äôt as good as it was when the Beastie Boys, Cypress Hill, 2pac, Snoop Dog, Eminem, and Lauryn Hill were more popular.

AskReddit,f7an7ez,t1_f7aa3b4,1573533763.0,"I feel like parents who don‚Äôt apologize can come across as aggressive. 
It‚Äôs vital for a child to have good communication with their parent and vice versa. 

When the parent isn‚Äôt apologizing, it‚Äôs almost like conveying that they think they‚Äôre right all the time (whether they mean to or not). That‚Äôs not to say they‚Äôre bad at what they do. It‚Äôs just that they have some things to work on. No one is perfect. 

It could be that a parent is afraid they might lose power/authority over their child by being vulnerable and apologizing. Let me just stop that thought in its tracks.

Admitting the wrong to your child/saying sorry, I think, will actually be an opportunity for the child to have a more clear view of humanity. It could possibly raise their respect for you, thus building on a healthier relationship. This will probably also make them more prone to admitting their mistakes to you, because they know that they can trust you to listen, as you‚Äôve trusted them to listen in other situations."
