Someone offers you a job, personal assistant, nonprofit, really anything. They say we’re gonna send you a check. Deposit it and when it clears you keep your “pay” from it, then use the rest to go buy iTunes cards or visas or wire the rest of it somewhere else. 

The person who sent it stays in contact til they get the cards or money back, then your bank finds out its a fraudulent check and you’re stuck holding the bag for however much the check was originally for. Usually takes 7-10 days after the check clears for the bank to find out. 

The person who “hired” you ghosts you & deletes all accounts they used in the scam.

You’d think it would be easy to spot, but right now people are desperate and making bad decisions. The story changes all the time. One thing to look out for, if you get a check in the mail that’s only a check with no paystub attached, it’s for sure a fraud."
