It could be that mods are not up to date to work on the experimental branch, I was able to play with a few mods with no problems on experimental. 

You can't rush game development, if you are not happy where the game is right now, come back in a few months.

And if you have questions or criticisms I suggest leaving those at their Q&A site (they read everything) at  [questions.satisfactorygame.com/](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/)  or even visit the stream tomorrow at noon EST (ish) and ask Jace and Snutt questions live at [twitch.tv/coffeestainstudiosdevs](https://www.twitch.tv/coffeestainstudiosdevs)."

Also most of the real lefties would go to live in the dem country and they would set up a real and powerful left party that would create a new, more sensible two-party system in the dem country pushing the entire country even more to the left and in turn making things better for regular folks.

For example when bullies beat other people up to show how strong and superior they are. Strength in itself is not a bad thing but can be used to do bad things.

Another example that is more bad for men is extreme self reliance where they never ever ask for help because if they can't do everything themselves then they are not a real man.
