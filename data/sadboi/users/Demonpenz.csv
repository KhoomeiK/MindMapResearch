Make better choices and live a better life while either living with feelings or dispersing the feelings by full acceptence.

seduction,ffxr0sm,t3_evnwpz,1580330713.0,The problem for me was I could never make myself feel the way a woman could. Once I realized that the way they made me feel wasn't going to last and that the way to have a sustainable amount is work on yourself. For me I had to have theropy and pills for depression bit ymmv. Once I knew that fine ass pussy only provided a short term bump in mood followed by a crash I could work on a good baseline of happiness for my future.

seduction,fdyj92a,t3_en51im,1578780381.0,Some people here need to get punched in the face a couple times really hard.  If you can take a punch and let those nuts hang in situations that is the essence of what girls are turned on by. Survival of the fittest. I draw the line at blowing out or embarrassing obviously dorky nerds or stealing or something like that though. Sometimes you can see guys out strugging to find an energy on a date or something and you dont have to blow them out you can go over and chat it up with them to help them. The key thing is always repeat what people say. People lpve their own words and it helps you to pay attention. Special creep points if you have a voice recorder so you can record your approaches so you can praise yourself for being ballsy and get better
seduction,fdyhg4u,t3_en51im,1578779831.0,You are going to have to learn how to make yourself happy in life. How to entertain yourself. Going out alone is good for that. Finding a wing that isn't a total clusterfuck is hard as well. I went out by myself for a long time because no one wanted to grind. Entertaining yourself cheaply is important for me at least because you can't always throw money at problems. Stand up straight eye contact and go all in is what I try to do. If I can do that I am winning.

seduction,fd3e2s3,t3_ejrtj9,1578157418.0,No tips or tricks just make strong eye contact stand up straight. Don't bail early and don't break the tension. It's pretty easy to go in and make some jokes to break the tension but going all in and having tension is what makes the whole situation interesting and powerful. You will figure out what works and what doesn't.
seduction,fcsk7mf,t3_eikk2p,1577918227.0,"I couldn't get my thoughts together but I just want to make some points really quick. Nice job asking for others thoughts. Realize that people around you are probably chump idiots who never get laid. Your problem is never the girls or the situation or the place the problem is always your EMOTIONS and you're lack of experience on how to handle them.  I have hit on all girls all the time for 10 years and I just focus on my breathing and stand up straight and make eye contact and talk from the heart. Don't have your focus on the feeling that a girl is out of your league. You know what the feeling is when she is ""Out of your league?"" It's just fear. Just another fucking emotion. Just be like. HI FEAR YOU FUCKING FAG. I am going to breathe and get through this shit because my boy Demonpenz told me online how to bust some nutz on hot girls faces."

You keep acting like a boss you will feel like a boss and you will eventually feel and see and know we are all blobs of goo that will dead as fuck in the and. The big thing is accept your feelings. Roll with that but they are just feelings. Hang around people that want you to be a pimp so you get support.

depression,fcj1b55,t3_cml6ni,1577674803.0,Last Sunday I was super down. No real reason. Just really down. I tried to fight out of it by going to the Casino which is dumb I know and playing video games. If I had to do it again I would have just given up trying to fight and go to bed. I watched the Chiefs win and ate trashy food. I also record things with my record voice recorder on my phone and I reminded myself that I am doing good to survive. I just need to accept my feelings and my feelings don't mean shit. The next day I felt a bit hungover from being so down but all and all it was good. I got somewhere on my video games and I still had some memories from Sunday. I am grateful and so thankful that I can feel like trash and depressed and I can fight through and still do fun things and at-least record them so later I can enjoy the pictures. I am grateful that I used to live with anxiety and depression so I know how to work and play through that. I know after studying and getting lots of help lots of people can't get out of their house and they kill themselves over depression. I thought about reddit and my advice would be just to have something recorded so you can hear the over and over or a video of you talking over and over because that helped later on after I felt better. Now that I think about it my down day was bouncing around from low low moods to just low moods. I will take that shit all day over how I was 10 years ago.
seduction,fbn09rj,t1_fbmlfp5,1576991034.0,I think you can look for IOI's but you got to focus on your shoulders and posture and eye contact. I found if I focus on what I can do I can walk away knowing that my game is in tact or growing and not put the outcome on shit I have no control over. No matter what I wish there was some sort of drug to inject guys in the game to feel good when they are rejected. It is truly a man who lets his nuts hang out that is out there living.
problemgambling,fblusps,t3_edqktm,1576970844.0,Don't beat yourself up that isn't going to help. Accept the feelings for what they are. You better get used to living with your emotions because once you stop gambling shit gets real. I don't think you fucked up you just don't have the tools yet to see this shit coming.
seduction,fb7uo0k,t1_fb4526u,1576599780.0,That is a good reply. Even if it got a bad reaction it is a good reply. Like in poker sometimes you play the right move but still lose. All in the game baby.
seduction,fb388j5,t1_fb376lk,1576466542.0,"Yeeeesh. The worst I got was this hot girl with her other hot friends. I go over there and say a couple things and she goes ""Leave our fucking table asshole"" It was at harpo's in KCMO and I wasn't doing anything crazy. Being from the midwest I know she was 1:showing off from friends and 2: I could tell she knew she hurt me. I walked back to my car and I just said ""You will live buddy you will go to work you will eat you will shit you will keep leaving it's just going to sting for awhile. That was the worst approach rejection ever and that was for a guy who is maybe a 4 on a good day approaching 8 9 and possibly a 10 in a set. If nothing else there is some sort of guy code when you get blown out so many times. You are in a special club of mental toughness. It helps that you are 80 percent automatic no matter how bad you hurt you still do shit. Like people die and you just move on. Getting shot down a girl is way less than someone dying."
seduction,fb351jh,t3_eb8fjh,1576464422.0,I am glad I am online to say this but I think girls are giving people all types of signals to approach. But most of the are uggo's or maybe too hot that you read it wrong. So just approach everyone. At worst you get toughened up.
seduction,fb34w29,t1_fb34jvz,1576464318.0,"Yeah but if you see a chance I would take it. Just to keep your courage up. I always use the universal sign for the headphones and they thing I am going to say something mind blowing and then I just strike up a conversation. You got a workout routine yada yada yada. You can then get a FB or Number or whatever after that. It isn't rocket science the only thing is if you are creepy, which I am. You could say something to get you banned. I never got banned because I get soft numbers and fb or ig's. So bottom line is I don't fuck much so don't take too much from me. What I am good at is approaching. I am the best at approaching and getting either a number or shot down that I have ever seen. Like I said though I don't fuck much. If I could go hard at the right spots I would get numbers up but alas I am old and busted"
seduction,fb348yx,t3_eb8fjh,1576463891.0,"It is really hard to get anything done in the gym. People bullshit about how they do it, but if you are just a good person it's easy in the midwest because everyone is nice."

depression_help,f9fcteu,t1_f9f0s4h,1575266702.0,What gives me some good feelings is women that I have crushes on texting me. I have just stories that I can write out or pretend that happens. I also love money so I love to pretend I have a shitload of money and what I would do with it. When you got depression nothing is too stupid or silly to do to get that shit off you. I remember one time I had some shoulder pads for football 10 years after I was done playing and I ran outside with them and pretended I was still in my glory days and I stopped because I thought it was stupid. Looking back I know now nothing is stupid or silly if it makes you happy. Jesus said be like little children.
depression_help,f9f0617,t3_e4p62d,1575256106.0,one thing I think made my depression worse as well is this idea I got to be a man and live in reality. Once I heard some stories that I need to play more. Like I need to play madden video game and pretend I am in the game. Like get into shit and unlock some of those good feelings I had before depression. If I am able to pretend sometimes it unlocks good vibes.
depression_help,f9ezylf,t3_e4p62d,1575255950.0,Don't put any effort in changing the feeling. Just sit in the feeling and it will pass. Look at your emotions like you are looking at the sky. Sometimes it is cloudy sometimes it is sunny. You can't control the weather just like you can't control the sky. If you haven't already I would check out Power Postures by Amy Cutty on youtube and I would practice some hypnosis by David Snyder. Basically you got to go back and put yourself in a state of the best happiness ever and do some physical work around that visual.  That is sweet that you know that your feelings are bullshit though. That is 90 percent of it is just accepting how you are feeling and just move on with your day
