IsItBullshit,fr3sa6d,t1_fr3s1k3,1589864888.0,"In Illinois we're seeing the medical/recreational stuff be much stronger than what is found on the street, which is causing an increase in laced marijuana on the street to compete with the higher grade stuff.

Edit: I'm not anti-marijuana, but people need to know what they are putting in their bodies. I wasn't clear when I said ""we're"". By ""we're"" I'm meaning child welfare specialists that are drug testing people weekly. I get to communicate with different social workers all over state and am seeing the trend of more and more clients testing positive for drugs they've never tested positive for before. Sure it could be a coincidence, I'm not saying legal marijuana is causing the trend. I'm just saying what we are seeing. 

There's been a huge spike in laced products since becoming legal. The legal stuff is safe, the street product is becoming more unsafe. There's so much k2 being mixed in with marijuana."

In Illinois, the agency would be required to assist the mother with finding housing. Usually through a housing advocacy program that helps them get set up with Section 8.

I'm curious if there is another reason, other than mother is having video visits in the car, as to why OP believes the mother is homeless.

I don't feel like OP is lying, but I feel like they might not know everything they think they know."
legaladvice,fr3pby1,t1_fr3onp9,1589862700.0,"Homelessness isn't a reason not to return a child, but that may depend on state. See Norman V McDonald for Illinois regarding poverty."
Fosterparents,fr3p2x2,t3_gmgw93,1589862518.0,"Keep in mind being homeless isn't a reason not to return a child. If getting housing is a court set requirement, the mother and agency will have to show the judge evidence, not just the mother's word. 

If you feel you are being treated unfairly, please contact the state's advocacy office. With many upset foster parents with children being returned home, there is a lot going on behind the scenes that they don't see. On the other hand, there could be a lot that the caseworker or agency doesn't see as well. You can attempt to hire an attorney to intervene on your behalf, but that can be costly and in many places won't do much. 

Some places have CASA or court appointed special advocates that advocate for what is best for the child. This could help yoir case or hurt it depending on what is going on behind the scenes and if they are a good CASA. They are a free service. It wouldn't hurt to contact them to see if they could request involvement on the case."

television,fr392ax,t1_fr2nh2d,1589852420.0,"I think they'd have to retcon the last season and parts of the second. Especially the ending. The series initially was expected to not start the books until season 4, but the series was barely renewed for a 2nd season and somehow survived for a 3rd. I don't know the official reasoning for why the books started showing up in season 2 (somebody please tell me if there's an official answer), but I've always thought they were trying to appeal to fans of the books/movies to keep the series alive. 

Despite that, season 2 is one of the my favorite seasons of any series and I normally hate the trope of showing the end at the beginning, then going back in time. Even though you know what is going to happen, the story stays tense right up to and all throughout the part shown at the beginning. You're at the edge of your seat all season. It's so good that it makes season one look just okay. Although I wasn't a fan of trying to appeal to the CSI or NCIS crowd by throwing in comedic relief from the lab techs. Felt so out of place, but is forgivable. 

Season 2 felt like they put their heart and soul into the series in an attempt to gain higher ratings/popularity. Then barely getting a season 3, they felt defeated. 

Everything is rushed in season 3. There's so much uninteresting dialog. I get part of the series' appeal is to make people with low to average intelligence feel smart (I'm on the lower end), but they went overboard for S3. I don't know how they could salvage the series if they kept that storyline in there. The unexpected romantic relationship really threw me off too. I'm all for trying new things with old stories, but it felt out of place.
