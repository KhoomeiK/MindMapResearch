Yes- he has dropped it. But OP says she also believes he has shut down in other ways- this is a tactic of those who emotionally abuse. They disrespect their partner's boundaries and push their own desires onto them. When they don't get their way completely they punish their partner by being withdrawn and cold. They refuse compromises when offered. They refuse to communicate their feelings or listen to their partner's feelings.

BPD,fd99g4f,t3_ek0j4l,1578230262.0,"I agree there is far too much stigma in relation to BPD. I will give you three pieces of advice which I've found have very much helped me and my partner.

1) bear in mind that BPD does not mean she is unreasonable or irrational. Her feelings are not delusional or made up, she just feels everything more intensely than non-BPD individuals. Make sure she knows you are aware of this, and you understand her feelings are valid. Give her space when she needs it.

2) a lot of BPD is based on fear of abandonment. I suspect this is why she has become increasingly dependent on you. Reassurance will go a long way to making her feel more secure when she is having an acute episode, but also generally. Reassure her you're there for her and she hasn't scared you away. If she feels more secure, her dependence on your might ebb.

3) if she's thinking about treatment and she decides to go on medication there will be a really difficult period of adjustment. I've been on SSRIs myself, the first few weeks are dark. There won't be much you can do to help her other than reminding her that the feelings aren't permanent. DBT might also be a good shout."

I stayed in a toxic relationship way longer than I should have, I've all but begged someone who I'd broken up with to give it a second chance even though I was miserable in the relationship, because I desperately didn't want to be alone.

What you're feeling isn't restricted to individuals with BPD it's how a lot of people feel. 

I will say this though, I didn't think I would be able to be on my own. I was so scared when we broke up that I wouldn't be able to cope, and break down. When I realised I had time to do things I enjoyed rather than having to spend time and mental energy on a boyfriend, I felt so strong, secure and independent. And it's lead me to healthier relationships because I know I'd rather be on my own than with someone who disrespects me. You will get there too.

Obviously that would not require justification, but maybe an explaination as to why their parent had been closeted for such a long time. It's an entirely different situation. It's also my opinion that as a parent your kids should take priority over a romantic relationship, and it doesn't sound like his father is taking his feelings into account.

There is likely massive gap in maturity here. Most age gaps like this don't survive for the long term, and I really don't see how this could be a particularly fulfilling relationship for either of them. Of course, I don't know them and neither do you. Neither of us can say if this will survive in the long-term, or if they have a healthy, fulfilling relationship based on trust, affection and mutual interest.

For me the strangest part of it is that instead of him viewing his young girlfriend in a paternal manner when they met, since she is the same age as his children, he is dating her instead. In addition to this, she's barely an adult, she can't legally drink and hasn't finished college. She has barely any life experience relative to himself. If either of my parents dated someone massively younger than them, with this much of an age gap, I would honestly be embarassed. I'd consider it immature.

He's also clearly upset that his girlfriend and dad's girlfriend are the same age. He seems to find it awkward and embarrassing, and is concerned his girlfriend is going to judge his dad and himself for his behaviour.

Also- I didn't say they needed to justify the relationship. I asked how they justified that he is old enough to be her dad."
