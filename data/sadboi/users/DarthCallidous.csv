Playing offline really takes that weight off my mind. I'm glad it's a feature. These games are *amazing,* the last thing I want is xxdickyprostaint69420xx lag stabbing me so he can remind me how bad I am at PVP with a gesture.

Something odd though: I've only lost one invasion in BloodBorne for some reason. With the exception of Sekiro, BloodBorne is the one that I'm the worst at in terms of PVE, but the best at in terms of PVP, but with the Souls games (Demon's-Dark Souls 3) I'm much better at playing against the mobs and bosses than BloodBorne, but I am *terrible* at player vs. player.
