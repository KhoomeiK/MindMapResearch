I feel like I've been dragged through Hell. I have suffered in the past also, in my late teens, severely depressed and suicidal. After that met my wife, got a good job, got a nice house and have 2 beautiful children. I have everything I could ask for but I am a total mess, no drugs but have been drinking on and off for years. Had a couple of stays in a psych unit, been admitted to hospital several times with self harm. I still have my job which is good, I'm on leave without pay. I cry all the time, I even think I'm going crazy. I see a Doctor a Psychiatrist a psychologist and also a.holistic psychologist. Been medicated the whole time, probably overmedicated tbh. I have suicidal thoughts quite often. There's been 2 times when I was ready to go. Then I think about my beautiful kids, how could I leave them. But living in this depression is killing me man, I'm so over it. Once again thanks for listening, it's good folk like yourself that give me faith in humanity.
