I would take this as a vacation if you can, not behind your companies back. I completely understand where you are coming from, just don't want you to loose your job."

I know it's hard but, it's over. Don't dwell on what happened. Focus on moving forward and becoming your best self. Then once time has healed you can look back on the good moments. 

You do not need him. You are strong."

She should not have you fix and she should not have her roommate fix it. If anything goes worse she will blame whoever does it and it will cause more problems. She needs to speak with a professional hairstylist. I know it seems like you need to do something but being supportive is the best thing you can do. She may need some time to calm down as well.

Offers to help out with your well being while the cancer passes. That guy is out there, I promise you that. It just isn't this one. Your friends will help you leave him, you need them as your support system. You can do this. You deserve a happy life. As you know, life is short, only keep those who love you.
