depression,f8nuftf,t3_dyazjo,1574653230.0,"Me to, everyone is becoming depressed nowadays, it seems pretty normal. I Kno to many people that are depressed. Depression sometimes doesn't go away. I myself is aways depressed, unable to enjoy this life, I self hate, I feel like God is evil. I don't enjoy this one given opportunity of a failing life. I can relate, mental illnesses are created by toxic people. And it gives them life and takes someone else's. I regret having any children's later on, because I aways see kids paying the price. I myself is paying the price for ever being borned."
