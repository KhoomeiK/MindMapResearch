BipolarReddit,ezi2vqp,t1_ezhw5iv,1567920413.0,"i agree that if he doesn‚Äôt follow through with getting help you should get out. (also i agree that this sounds much more like mania instead of hypo mania) it‚Äôs sad but it is in your best interest, especially if you are struggling with your own mental health as well. speaking from only my personal experience, my hypo mania can be kind of scary and violent when i‚Äôm in a really bad place and i hurt myself because of it and i have scared my partner before (and im a small girl) ‚Äîmy point in that is just to say be careful and always take care of you first. 

have you brought up bipolar with him at all before? not like ‚Äúhey you have bipolar‚Äù but more of a like ‚Äúwow did you know bipolar is marked by x y z, i always thought it was just mood swings‚Äù to kind of encourage him to be introspective.  i know that as soon as i really looked into what bipolar is i was like ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs me chief‚Äù and i knew i needed to get help, i needed someone to guide me but not to tell me i had this mental illness. 

good luck and keep your chin up, it‚Äôs hard to deal with us sometimes. but remember this is not your burden to bear if you can‚Äôt handle it. take care of yourself first, you can always support him from afar you don‚Äôt have to be so closely entangled with him and his struggle if it is hurting you every day."
