SeriousConversation,fqbbdl5,t3_ghjmzv,1589233898.0,"I fought with doctors for 15 years.  I started when I was 17 I new at a young age I never wanted kids.   I finally got it done when I was 31. I went in with all my research,  I also went in and talked with the doctor for a while discussed why this was the best option for me  versus all the others. I also acted like an “adult” used the proper terminology and all. My doctor said she would put in for the referral.  I was shocked finally it worked.  I was one step closer.   She didn’t try to change my mind one bit.  But the next doctor.  The one who was to do it..  I had to plead my case with him,   So I did the exact same thing. His “compromise” was give it one month to weigh out the pros and cons he told me about.  Then if I still wanted it. He would do it.  

I called the office the next day and booked the appointment for one month and one day later.  

Best thing I have ever done!  

It was tough battle. And the only advice I can give is do your research.     Find a doctor who will do it on you her woman if need be. I was even prepared to go to the USA and pay out of pocket for it.   

Best of luck"
SeriousConversation,fmqkcce,t3_fwr2p5,1586301311.0,"I don’t know how the rules and regulations work in your area.  I worked in a retirement home here. And I have worked for companies like this ( quit as soon as I noticed the neglect) and reported it to the authorities.  But what I would do is I would actually call the local police, and speak with them.  We have a department within our police service that deals with the elderly and neglect. Because straight up this is what that is.  

Even if you don’t have a certain department to deal with it with in the police department.  at least they can send for an ambulance or EMS to determine if she is fit to look after her self.  Or if there is a medical emergency.   For example. An UTI  can disguise as memory loss or as dementia in seniors."

They (hopefully) will understand and share some stories.  Which in return you can write about, and tell her how they made you feel.    Sometimes even just writing a letter with no actual purpose can help. Or even explain to her what it is your feeling and write that you don’t know much about her, but ask  about the things you wanted to know.   Even though she’s not there to answer directly, I believe she will get this letter and respond in a way that will help you."

SeriousConversation,eve1rjc,t1_eve0j4b,1564453185.0,"Thank you for that!  I know the answer the the first question.   I have been beaten down so bad by a lot of people in my life that I feel I can not and do not deserve or get anyone better.  I feel I am not worthy of a good relationship.   I am since I started school realizing that this is not true.  I know that I am the only person who can determine my worth and I am the only person who shall dictate it as well!   This is why I am trying to leave.   I know I deserve better.  I know I want better for my self.  But every single time I try  I get weak and I fall for his manipulative ways and think things will be different.  

As for Question number two.  
I pay the house hold bills. I buy the groceries, I have put my self into so much debt because of him, and trying to make him happy  that I have fucked up almost all aspects of my life.  So I know I’m not in it for the money, or because  I “have” to be.  My parents have told me 100times that I can stay with them till I get back on my feet.  I believe I am here because I feel bad for his son.  To be honest if the child wasn’t in the picture I would probably have been gone a long time ago.  And I know his son is not my responsibility.  But if I’m not in the kids corner then who is.  :( 

And Number 3 
I can’t picture my future.  

Since I have been with him I have attempted suicide 4 times.  And I can’t picture a future. 

I want to be able to do that.  I want to be back to my happy loveable self.  I want to start going back to the gym, eating better, not stressing out over what he thinks or says.   I want happiness again!"
