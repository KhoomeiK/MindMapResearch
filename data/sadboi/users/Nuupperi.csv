awakened,fn9o7gf,t3_g0aurp,1586780010.0,People often forget that parents can use right amount or too much power. OP does not have to be a parent to understand. Also a parent can be toxic and overcontrolling. It does not justify an act to be a parent.

We are meant to help each other, enjoy living on earth and create art, not be part of some system which makes(some of us) us sick. We live in a world where it is sometimes more acceptable to be rich, working crazy hours and feeling tired than taking time for our true purpose in this planet. It is actually very interesting to see how many people are spending their lifes in this system.Good thing is that you can often choose your path! :)"

First of all, I am quite new to AB products. I would like to switch my current skincare routine(non-AB based).

I am using some natural cosmetic cream and also tea tree water when I have breakouts.

I have dry skin, I live in northern Europe and have not tried any asian products before. I also like more natural ingredients. Can you help me, where do I start with my new skincare routine??"
