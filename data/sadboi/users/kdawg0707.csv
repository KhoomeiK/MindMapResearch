However, since I have a slowly developing attachment style and limited time to date, these generally end up being my best opportunities. I‚Äôve learned through trial and error that it‚Äôs best to be honest, cautious with dramatic flare, with a low baseline expectation for reciprocity. For example, when I asked my current SO out for dinner, she said no in a very kind and respectful manner. I replied with straightforward gratitude for her honesty, as that‚Äôs literally all I have a right to expect in these situations. 

We continued to communicate regularly over text for about a week, when she surprised me by asking me out on the same date she had initially declined. Obviously, things don‚Äôt always work out this way, but respecting your own feelings and those of the people around you is a reward in and of itself. Also greatly increases your chances of ending up in a mutually supportive relationship- after all, such a thing is definitively impossible if you are not actively supporting the feelings of those around you."

AskReddit,fhxc1oc,t3_f4wrsn,1581950700.0,"Had an 18 year old female patient, with a complicated medical history. She had over 30 drug allergies listed on her chart- she and her mother insisted this was because of a rare genetic immune disorder called mast cell degranulation syndrome (MCDS). They had many special requests which they imposed on the hospital staff because of this, including- no use of foam hand sanitizer, no latex gloves, even outlandish things like, ‚Äúno glitter allowed in the room‚Äù. 

We went to great lengths to keep them happy, and her minor skin infection that brought her in looked fine. Things got interesting when I reviewed her chart and found a visit with a pediatric immunologist from about 5 years back. Turns she had extensive testing done for MCDS, all of which was completely negative. She was formally diagnosed with a much more benign condition called chronic urticaria, which is essentially extremely sensitive skin. Said specialist clearly explained and documented this diagnosis, along with clear instructions for the patient to avoid dangerous medical interventions such as epinephrine. In other words, none of her drug reactions were true allergies, nor were they life threatening in any way.

Clearly they did not believe this diagnosis, and instead had latched themselves onto the much scarier MCDS despite the negative test results. I believe the root of the problem is an underlying psych disorder called M√ºnchausen syndrome, in which one develops an overwhelming emotional attachment to the idea and role of being sick. She continued to demand referrals to other specialists, as is common with Munchausen patients. She now sees a hematology physician who believes her self reported diagnosis of severe allergies and prescribes her epi pens, which the patient self injects multiple times per week. Worst part is that she is unlikely to live a normal lifespan if this self inflicted medical abuse continues- epinephrine can cause strokes, aneurysms, and other severe vascular issues if used irresponsibly, even in otherwise young and healthy patients."
