GooglePixel,flibru1,t3_foq692,1585179255.0,"1. I'm not really enjoying paying the premium price for a phone specs that are behind the other premium phones. My main draw for the Pixel series was the pure Android experience and the camera software and they've both been great. My Pixel 3XL still makes great photos so I'm willing to upgrade to something else while still being able to take photos with my 3XL.
2. I'm really looking at the Surface Duo. I'm a huge nerd for new tech and I almost always have two windows split on my work computer and home desktop. I wanna see what that's like on a phone.
3. I don't know if I would, honestly. Especially with the Duo. The whole reason I got a Pixel phone was because I didn't want to root my phones to get vanilla Android so I'd probably leave it alone."
