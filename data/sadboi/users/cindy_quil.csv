I just finished my first term of nursing school last week and I feel like my study/note taking strategies were kind of evolving into what you just described, but it‚Äôs so helpful that you listed exactly what you did.  Especially since I get frustrated when I have too many papers folders or notebooks with random notes all over, so the one notebook thing is a good idea. First day of my next term starts tomorrow and I‚Äôm definitely going to use your tips!"
AskReddit,fpewjll,t3_gcswj0,1588556488.0,"Eastward and Witchbrook, both are currently still in development I believe (though maybe witchbrook still more in the planning stage even) and both involved with Chucklefish. I just really love the art style I‚Äôve seen so far (mainly pixel art) and character designs for each game! Eastward story already looks intriguing and Witchbrook is supposed to be a magical school kind of simulation (aka Harry Potter) and sounds super fun. Unfortunately I think it‚Äôll be a while until they are ready for release, there‚Äôs not much recent updates for either!"

I just experienced it again now and I came to this sub to find support...at least that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm trying to cope with it, it‚Äôs comforting knowing that there are others who can relate because it is a bit hard to describe it to friends. Like others said it‚Äôs best to find distractions like school/hobbies that will keep your mind occupied, that‚Äôs when I find I experience it the least. Weirdly enough though, the numb feeling I get from being detached from real life made it easier on me during exercise..like it actually lessened the pain of running during PT bc I didn‚Äôt feel like it was actually real and that I was feeling anything lmao."
veganrecipes,f1rqaql,t1_f1ro029,1569718807.0,"Hmm, I think it would still be fine without the spinach, the spinach only really helps add the green color and a little bit of moisture. I don‚Äôt think it would make a big difference if it was left out, as it doesn‚Äôt affect the flavor either."

I followed it mostly except I omitted the rose water and did not make the icing, and baked into into a square cake pan instead of a loaf. The pistachio flavor is really nice and mild, and the cake overall is not super sweet. I think it‚Äôs super cool that the green color comes from both pistachios and spinach- which you can barely taste even though there‚Äôs a whole cup and a half in there!"

Baking,f1phh80,t1_f1oqo1u,1569680590.0,"Of course! I followed this recipe pretty much exactly except regarding the earl grey tea. I didn't have any food coloring for the grey dough so I ended up blending up about 6 tbsp of tea leaves (both english breakfast and earl grey) into a powder and mixed it in, actually turned it into a really nice speckled grey color. The tea leaves on their own give a pretty mild flavor, so I do recommend adding more than the recipe asks for if you want a stronger tea flavor.

I couldn‚Äôt tell the gender either. This was at like 12 am, in the summer, and it hadn‚Äôt rained for a couple days.
