glasgow,fnygyy6,t1_fnx67ms,1587362787.0,"If you're up for volunteering, perhaps give Get Well Gamers a look? 

We're based in Glasgow, and to be entirely honest your story is...pretty eerily similar as to why I got involved (I was lonely as hell and my social circle was largely crushed) and have found it to be hugely beneficial socially!

If not ourselves, I'd absolutely echo the idea that volunteering is a terrific way to make connections."
