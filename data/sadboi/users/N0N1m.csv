Anyhow... Aside from contacting police and stuff, you got to do somethinf for you mental health. Ofcourse counseling and stuff is something you can do but after reading this I was thinking.. Maybe you need to do a soort like kickboxing.

With that you can get your strength back, mentally (and physically getting strong) togethet with counseling. I think talking about it alone won't be good enough. You need to feel strong about yourself. I hope you seriously consider this..

Much love."
