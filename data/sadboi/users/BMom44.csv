Not the wrath of an evil narcissist.
They are evil monsters."
NarcissisticAbuse,fhgmia3,t3_f3330o,1581571389.0,"Yes, he is fake. They all are.
What you saw wasn‚Äôt real, only what we wished it would be.
It‚Äôs all lies. Every word of it.
My narc told me he was in love with me, 3 days later, he discarded me. Just gone.
It‚Äôs been a week and I‚Äôm still struggling, but I‚Äôm determined to get there.
I want my life back."
NarcissisticAbuse,fhgm9ef,t3_f2y8uy,1581571172.0,"One week since my narc discarded me, out of the blue.
Said he was in love with me, 3 days later, discarded.
He‚Äôs a sick monster. They all are. 
I hope he rots in hell.
It‚Äôs been tough. Depress and anxiety.
But I am determined to get through this.
I deserve it.
We are worthy!"
NarcissisticAbuse,fhg34q7,t1_fhfyskg,1581557494.0,"My narc said the same thing to me.
They are predictable. They all do the same thing in the same way. 
Today, I spent the day in bed, depressed.
I still can‚Äôt believe he did this to me.
How are you hanging in?"
NarcissisticAbuse,fhfdwtl,t1_fhf7bmi,1581541438.0,"That‚Äôs what happens. We are so devastated by the discard, that when they give us attention or love bomb us, we are euphoric. 
I miss him. But I will not call or text him.
I have no idea why he left me. 
He loved me and then he was gone.
I know Narcs don‚Äôt know how to love, it‚Äôs the high they love.
But it still hurts, unbearably so.
I haven‚Äôt gone out in almost a week.
Just too sad.
I‚Äôm still trying to figure it out, but I know I never will."
NarcissisticAbuse,fhf4lw6,t1_fhecd3a,1581536113.0,"Yes, I feel abandoned too. That‚Äôs exactly how I feel.
He was telling me he was in love with me, the day he left, he said I love you, got in his car, two hours later an argument on the phone and he hung up.
Got a text that said I need time away from you right now. After I sent him a hundred texts.
After he said he was in love with me, loved me.

How long has your narc been gone?
Mine happened last Wednesday."
NarcissisticAbuse,fhd8naj,t1_fhd0egz,1581479772.0,"Did he just discard you one day? Out of the blue?
On the Monday, he said he was in love with me, on the Wednesday, he said, I love you.
Two hours later we had an argument on the phone. He hung up. I texted him a hundred times and called.
No answer. Poof! He was gone!
It‚Äôs new, so I‚Äôm still dealing with depression and anxiety.
I miss him. I know I shouldn‚Äôt. 
He‚Äôs f***ed up my mind. I‚Äôm so confused."

Thank you for the article."

I‚Äôm so messed up and confused."
NarcissisticAbuse,fh2448s,t1_fh241rt,1581234321.0,"Thank you.
I just feel stunned.
No warning signs.
I mean he said he loved me, 2 hours later, we were arguing. He hung up.

And he‚Äôs gone.

What did I do wrong?"
NarcissisticAbuse,fh23sbj,t1_fh22xmc,1581233906.0,"I‚Äôve blocked him.
I‚Äôm just devastated."

NarcissisticAbuse,fdmljj9,t3_em0uo1,1578554498.0,"Don‚Äôt settle. Take what you are legally entitled to.
Don‚Äôt let him ‚Äúwin‚Äù because you want a quick divorce.
You have a plan. Stick to it. 
It sounds like you have been preparing and are ready.
I left an abuser after 9 years. He threatened my child while choking me to the point of passing out. 
I left immediately and never went back.
You‚Äôre smart, you have a plan.
You have support and love. 
You‚Äôll leave and you‚Äôll be a survivor.
Good for you.
All the very best."
NarcissisticAbuse,fdml6mj,t3_em3drf,1578554080.0,"You feel like you need him. When in reality, you never needed him. He needed you, for supply.
Find a focus and run with it.
All the very best."

Don‚Äôt reply. Don‚Äôt do it.
It‚Äôs hell."
NarcissisticAbuse,fb8b16f,t1_fb8a4ye,1576610022.0,"Yup, my narc gives me the silent treatment and then says I called or texted him too much.
What a loser! 
They are all the same.
Some days, I hate him. I really do.
Working on breaking free."
NarcissisticAbuse,fap78kz,t1_faowju0,1576281629.0,It is cruel. Narcs are very sick. They have a mental illness. I find the silent treatment excruciatingly painful. I feel gutted.
NarcissisticAbuse,faok6pc,t3_ea74lf,1576266185.0,"Silent treatment is the worst. It leaves you feeling 
ignored, insignificant, with high levels of anxiety and depression.
I understand. My narc sometimes does it to me for a few days. Always has an excuse.
They do it to keep you feeling like you need him and when he finally calls, you are euphoric, all the stress and anxiety are gone.

Just remember, the silent treatment is a game to them.
He knows that you‚Äôre going out of your mind. It gives him a high. Silent treatment is a typical narc tactic.

There are lots of YouTube videos. Search, narcissist, silent treatment.

Try and wait him out. He‚Äôs enjoying this.
And when he finally calls, try and be cool and calm, like it didn‚Äôt bother you. That will confuse him.
Because he expects you to be elated that he‚Äôs back.

Stay strong. 
He‚Äôll be back."
NarcissisticAbuse,fahnt7y,t1_fagqbx5,1576089721.0,Love your closing sentence. This is MY birthright to be happy! Thank you for your inspiring words.
