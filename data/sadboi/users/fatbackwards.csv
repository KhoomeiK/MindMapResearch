Then, a decade later, I moved back and live in my old house and just see... how much worse it is from the rest of the world in many aspects. Not all, mind you. There are some very huge plusses living here; but 

- no social nets that are worth while.
- Hostile workplace practices that, also, outright condones talking about wages.
- Lack of clean, orderly, and proper public transport systems.
- Below average education systems that do not teach life skills, like how to have a bank account, how to do taxes, and other skills.
- Expensive health care that's tied to being employed.
- LITERAL *MOUNTAINS* OF DEBT is considered *NORMAL* and ***EXPECTED***.

Please have a lot of patience with him, and please don't judge him.

He's showing a vulnerable side that's very genuine to you, one that he had kept under lock and key and shielded all his life.

I can tell you that the ""oddly bold idea"" was pre-planned out for a while. He just didn't know if you would accept it, and he was afraid you'd walk if he did; but in his fantasies, I'm sure he had that whole speech and tour done several times.

AgePlaying,fmaivqz,t3_fsth80,1585895652.0,"Hey, I've been in a long distance relationship for over two years, and if it helps... I can give you a few tips:

1. It's ok. Breathe. Everyone's been in the same position you are in, long distance or not. It's not easy to, overall, do a long distance dd/lb relationship; especially as a caregiver. SO! I should just say, THANK YOU. The FACT that you're trying should speak volumes for you, because there are a lot of people who wouldn't want to do it.

2. Treat your little one like a child. It sounds easy because it kinda iss.... I'll be revealing a bit. I'm a little. I'm a switch, actually; but I was a little before I was a switch. I CrAvE discipline.... even if I beck and MoAn about it. What I'd suggest? Why is the onus on you? Make HIM record himself diapered/punished and send it to you. You said you're gonna meet up with him, add some not so good punishments when he disobeys that. I know as a sub little, I love getting spanked... but a time out when you ignore me would set me right, because I'd be embarrassed that's the kind of punishment I earned. ALSO, don't be afraid to bust out the standard lines of ""I won't do this because my caregiver tells me so"" roughly x100 times, and then mail it to you. It not only makes him write the letter, but makes him seal it, stamp it, and send it to you.... interfering with his adult side, too :P
3. You have more impact on your little than you think. So, I write this because often times the ""little"" is the controller of the relationship. And yes, he or she is... without their consent, you can't do your job/role. But, as a little, I know I crave attention, sexual stimulation, and discipline. And, if I'm comfortable with you, I'd be willing to sacrifice some of that for a lean on other parts. Sometimes, if a punishment isn't helping, give your little a ""choice"". For example:
 Say he's acting up because he doesn't want a bath.
You can ask him: Hey... I'm on skype/whatsapp/whatever and already talking to you, wouldn't you want to bathe with me there, or would you rather bathe on you own and send me the results? >This sends the little's mind racing! If I bathe alone, I miss out on all the praise my dom gives me; but if I bathe alone and send them photos, I can enjoy and setup maybe a photo set.
4. No one has it perfect. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS IS TO COMMUNICATE TO YOUR SUB/LITTLE ABOUT EVERY THING. IN FACT, EVERY ""FUCKING"" THING. You won't move forward with your relationship if either of you aren't talking. Please. Set some time to talk with them and find out what they'd be willing to do and what they won't. Set a safe word. And make sure that if they don't follow what they say, that there will be consequences. Withholding contact IS a valid thing, so don't feel bad. Often times as well, people publish all sorts of things that they do as a dom/sub.... talk about it! See if your little actually wants to partake in that; but make sure your little talks to you and actually makes time for you. There's nothing worse than someone who leaves you hanging. I've been on both sides and it's soul crushing. :( Make every attempt to talk to your little, or say when you can't; and ask your little to do the same, even when they're being bratty. (Because, if they're bratty, they want to be dominated, but they can't ask you outright... because.... brat logic. I knolw, I'm also a brat sometimes.)

IF you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to ask me. And I'm really happy for you! You've got some awesome futures ahead!"

So... I know I have this, and it's a strange experience to have. It's kinda like having two of ""you"" in your mind. One is the one you identify with, and the other is... well... it's you, but different. For me, my other me is around 4 - 5 years old and is diapered, for some reason. I do think it's from emotional trauma I had, because I don't have any real memories of anything since before 3rd grade, and when I try to probe my mind in those spots, I get a headache and nausea. 

As for the girl switching between so easily... Yeah, I do that too. I don't quite understand how to describe it; but when you shift between your personalities, your mind kinda fogs up and you... nap? in your head. That's usually when my little comes out and he has the ability to ""wake"" me if he needs help. It's... actually quite peaceful, but I worry that one day I won't want to wake up anymore. Coupled with being an actual ABDL too, I can really get into a little state when I dress as one. I'm slowly trying to wean myself off and keep just like... charms... or keychains that I can focus on to make sure both of me are happy during the day.

Me as me, like the person writing... I love rough sex and whips and belts. I feed off of that hardcore. In both giving AND receiving.

My little? No fucking way in hell. And I'll fight to protect that side of me from anyone. My little needs affection and calm, hugs and cuddles. He actually doesn't want sex at all... which is kinda... well, I'm glad at least; because that just means I get to indulge in sex more when I'm in control(?). It's again, hard to explain.

But I do know, it's a sickness. I'm sick. I'm seeing professional help. I don't know if I'll ever be normal, but I know I don't have shame about it anymore.

It was either live like this or suicide. And I'm alive. So I guess I made a good decision. 

I most certainly am that girl you described. I hope I helped you understand. If you have anymore questions, feel free to PM me.

Edit: The more I think about that girl, the better I feel. She found who she was in life. I just accepted it myself. She had a lot of inner strength to live that way. Thanks for sharing, Phoenix.

It's important to have a balance. Yes, you are little, but you are also the sum of your experiences that led you to your actual age, too. And to cast those aside also is just as bad.

That's where I draw the line. You don't want your little side to overpower everything else and be your main life line. It's good to want to do it, and indulge in it, but don't quit your job and become a permanent little. 

As it also stands, I'm also an ABDL from some childhood trauma that I also can't remember, at all. I'd recommend seeing professional help to help you set your own line in the sand. I know my psychologist is helping me with that."

It's a big step to admit that you are a little, and I'm proud of you that you could do it. :) But like with everything, a good balance needs to be held.

I would recommend getting something innocuous that you can attach your feelings towards that isn't outright noticable. For example: a bracelet, ring, or pin. 

I wear fun socks under my dress slacks and office shoes. I also have a keychain attached to my work bag with a resting bear, one of those cute ""Rilakkuma"" ones. On the surface, it just seems like a harmless charm I keep on my bag, but looking at it helps me cope and deal with the emotions I have... and reminds me that am more than my little side; since it's hooked to my work bag.

I have a feeling that can help you a lot. It's not quite soft, but it helps you stay afloat in that mess of emotions and rough thoughts that haunt you. I know, I have them too. 

BTW, I keep my emotional stuffie at home, under a blanket, where he loves to nap; but I don't expect to take him anywhere, because ""I"" wouldn't want to expose him to the outside world, as he means the world to me."

DeadBedrooms,fgmzm97,t1_fgm23c6,1580934931.0,"I am like that. It was a lot of work to get me to open up, and I felt very vulnerable.

 I grew up in a house that sex was not talked about, at all. I went to Catholic school, which also made it worse and dirty. I remember, our idea of a movie day in Religion class, was a movie where an angel/ghost would do 4th wall breaks at a party to promote abstinence (in a ""kewl kids"" way. For example, for one couple, he was holding a chicken drumstick, acting as an NFL announcer, doing a play by play of how this couple was straying from God).

That whole thing messed me up something fierce. There were days where I would loathe trying to go to bed, because I knew she was in the mood and I just had so much anxiety for seemingly nowhere. 

My girlfriend and I were really fighting over it after a while. Eventually we had a talk where I told her what's going on in my head and that led to me figuring out a few things. Now, it's a bit more direct. We talk about it and ask before we start anything. I, still, find it very hard to open up sexually, but it's leaps and bounds better now."

I'm not asking making everything a battle all the time, but you had what... Cantina attack and starkiller base attack in TFA, Slow chase and speeder attack in TFA, and then tie chase and ""the battle to end all battles"" in TRoS. Out of space battles, you get like... 3. And they all are subpar to what we've already seen in the prequels and OT. And that's sad.

I really was excited for the huge space battle at the end of TROS. I just wanted a big old melee where ships fought and destroyed each other. Instead, I got nothing. We get only a few scenes and then all the star destroyers blow up everywhere. No battle of endor or battle of coruscant style of fighting..."

From his first showing and his sarcastic quip, to his tempter tantrums as he realizes how much he's being taken for a ride, really sold the character for me. It's a little silly that he went out to shoot Jyn with a pistol at the end, but I blame Disney Trilogy recuts for that.

That being said, I'm with you. I don't really like most of Rogue One. The 'other' characters are forgettable, Jedah sucks, tentacle monster was stupid, Sal Gerrera was very odd on screen, and the whole sequence on the asteroid/rain planet where Jyn's father dies is contrived and boring. The only thing that really seals the deal is the last 40 minutes, but it's so good that I almost forgive the movie for the whole beginning."

-Episode 7's main plot point was to kill Han Solo.

-Episode 8's final fight killed Luke Skywalker.

-Episode 9's plot had to kill Leia, because the late Carrie Fisher passed away, and packaged that up to elevate Poe Dameron, who was shown that Leia didn't trust in TLJ.

badroommates,fffal7q,t3_et15rb,1579879725.0,"I moved into a room containing a former occupant that smoked hasish, weed, and ciggarettes with the window closed. I know this, because all of my roommates informed me of it as I was moving in; and how they organized a letter with evidence to the landlord.

From what I gathered, they were in the same boat. He wouldn't stop, at all. Asking him, pleading with him, bargaining with him; no dice. So they had him evicted.

When I moved in, however, I had to deal with the aftermath. Yellowed walls, furniture that smelled of smoke... I stored clothing and it would smell like I smoked a pack a day in them. I had to ask the landlord to repaint my room with anti-smokers white paint, and scrubbed all my furniture up and down. What I saw help the most was those water absorption/smell absorption plastic boxes they have in hardware stores, and liberal amounts of dryer sheets. Airing out didn't help much.

If you have one take-away from this, don't be nice. I was nice; but being both a renter, and someone who rents out, don't be nice. People will take advantage of you, even friends. Lay out all the rules ahead of time, and fight for your own when they're violated. Some people will outright lie to placate you. And I know this, because in his case... if I just wanted to smoke, I'd lie to you too, and come up with excuses. Document and photograph everything. Look for the ""money shot"" of an ashtray or bong, and report it. Hell, I'd even go in with a fire extinguisher and spray his room down the next time you sense him smoking. It's mean, but it gets results. 

Oh, and lock your door. If you don't have a lock, ask to install one. He'll come after you once he sees you're not backing down. Trust me."
swrpg,ff6zu8g,t1_ff6y5cr,1579638285.0,"So, I'd love to. And that's how they got to this point. We had a sandbox game for a while, and now they hate dealing with the consequences of their actions. If I can, let me list this out:

- One plays a smugger with a rather extensive backstory, and she's also rather creative. She mainly is in charge of organizing stuff and planning stuff out, kinda. She's the glue that kinda holds the party together, since the rest of the party is hard to organize. She is also saying that she enjoyed the earlier dungeon crawling of the first phase; and she's the one mostly going now ""Oh yeah, that thing"".

- Another plays a Grey Jedi, turned Sith Lord working for Palpatine. He released the sith alchemy plague to the galaxy in an effort to create a ""bone army"", based on a holocron of a long dead lord of the sith's knowledge. His direct actions and mistakes have caused the current conflict, one where I suspect he wants to quit the game, because he thinks it's too hard to fix and he doesn't want to.

- One plays a sniper. Doesn't matter because he doesn't bring anything to the table except jokes. He always runs away from conflict and story hooks. He's the one who just goes to the ship to ""protect it"" while forcing the rest of the team to work out puzzles. I've also attempt to role-play parts with him separately, but I can tell he hates it; and I've attempted to talk with him privately, and in group, to rectify the situation with him; but he's happy to play it as it is, because when there is some extreme combat, he'll fire off a sniper round and ""help"". (I admit, he is a bit odd at social functions, but he genuinely wants to participate, and only with a character he makes; so I tolerate it and make sure it doesn't get too grating on the group, while allowing him to have his fun[?].)

- Last is a character that joined in around Phase 1 transition to Phase 2. A battle clone trooper whose in it to have fun, throw grenades, and cause chaos. Him and the Sith Lord usually come up with some fun ideas for chaos, but he does have some good temperament. He's the most on board, just trying to kill or run.

Anywho, those are my players. They setup the whole conflict with their choices, and I've already told them in two restructuring meetings how they ended up where they were, all to frowns. Turns out, people don't like it when you point out their mistakes... They really wanted an open campaign with consequences. Now though, they hate dealing with the consequences of their actions... and it seems like even putting in distractions doesn't cut it either. I honestly believe no one is having fun anymore; and if they were, when they meet at the table, their overall mood gets brought down.

Anywho, thanks for coming to my TED talk. :)

Edit: Rereading what you mentioned, I think I'm gonna finish this campaign off overall; start fresh with new characters, and set it up like you suggested. :)"
swrpg,ff6xc1s,t1_ff6wa19,1579636816.0,"We do play board games and really enjoy ourselves. However, with my RPG sessions, I get a lot of ""Why are we doing this again?"" or ""Oh right, that thing... that like we needed to do 4 months ago or something."" usually ending with a defeated sigh.

Anywho, I'm more than convinced I need to just trim the fat and end the game. Maybe start a new one with new characters."
swrpg,ff6u8hu,t3_ervhl7,1579634990.0,"I think I set myself up for it; but it still hurts.

I'm in almost year two of my campaign, and things have come to a drag. The game's been restructured twice, and the second restructuring has also had large gaps where we couldn't meet, compared to first and second phase.

In an effort to recapture lightning in a bottle, I tried to setup this whole spooky haunted-house like experience; where my players land on this outlaw, free-for-all asteroid, headed by a crime lord Hutt; who would occasionally play games with the station for views on his massive streaming empire. In addition, the overall game, which involves a sith alchemy plague that's causing the dead to reanimate, has made it to the station; and the players also could find more clues as to how to stop it.

We had two sessions there. The first one was that the players blew up a chunk of the station out of fear, when I revealed the dead walked... and the second, they were just so bogged down with my game, and so disinterested in the setting or characters, that I literally felt them ""Pressing X to Skip"" in their chairs.

So, in a place I thought I'd keep them for like 6 - 7 sessions, I shortened it to just ending it at the end of session 2, and killed off all the plot hooks and events there.

I think it's just time to end this campaign. I get the feeling no one wants to play it anymore, and they just want out. It's a crushing feeling, as I still have so much to give; but, I'm not about to hold my players hostage. We're meeting tonight, so there's probably gonna be another restructuring; but this one is the final one, pointing straight to the ending."

When the ships come in and save him from himself, we fucking focus back on Rey, Kylo, and the Emperor's stupid plan. It sucks.
