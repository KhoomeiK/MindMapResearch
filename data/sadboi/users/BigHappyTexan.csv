Both my biological's are sadistically cruel and love their games thus in a way this was just another way for them to abuse me by reminiscing and sharing their moment with one another through me.  I am fully aware that I was participating in this dynamic but I really wanted to know and they where so open.  This behavior only lasted a few years and then they both shut it down since they where afraid that others would find out.  I am totally alienated from them and even though lots of CASH is offered to reunite or visit I will never do so, to me its like taking money from your rapists only so they can spend time with their victim and gloat.  Currently I'm preparing to file for disability due to the severity of my PTSD and how it has damaged my body so intensely that I actually have trouble walking.  Even though this is my life I am so much happier knowing that I am free.

My secret is Dr. Pepper and crackers or bread.  I recently got stem cells for my back and they really helped with the PTSD symptomologies.  My acid-reflux has stopped and I got my night vision back from having developed Type2 diabetes.  The suffering has really been reduced, in fact I have had 6 flashbacks today and that's this biggest amount I have ever had.  Then on top of that we are having tornado warnings in a spot in Texas where we really get tornadoes and then to make it even more dramatic the storm chasers have arrived in town and my kiddos are all freaked out.  However, my coping skills are strong and due to the stem cells I am not suffering the usual symptoms which would have by now sent me to bed.  Whats the proof of all this?  Well, im up and able to chat with about these things and I was present enough to calm my children and right now I feel Copacetic.  If you live in Dallas just let me know and I will send ya to the guy that gave me my Stem cells.

As I have explained before some of us who are traumatized look to others to support us in our time of need and it is totally dysfunctional to do so.  This is a job for professionals and not you AT ALL!!!!!!!  I work with survivors and victims and I am a Foster Father, when an assault has occurred I let them know that their is work to do and that their calendar needs to clear up so we can get them the help they need.  You are not that help you are a distraction to what needs to occur perhaps neither of you can see that right now but its inevitable that separation will occur.  A victim has to find themselves again after their world gets rocked.  You also need to look into some therapy on your own especially if you have attracted the traumatized before, some of us seem to give out that signal that attracts the wounded when we are too wounded to even help ourselves.  You need time to find you so get that started ASAP.  Meaning stop dating all together for a semesters or more until you figure you out.

One of my Drs likened it to having a slave name and then a free mans name.  I highly recommend it and remember that’s how we got Erik Ericsson he had no air name since his mother had never married and when he came to America that was frowned upon so he said, “I will simply be the Son of me” thus his name was born.  Once you change your name then be open as to why and people will support you it’s amazing.

Being this way has allowed me to avoid so much depression and anxiety also if people point fingers then I either win them over or move on without them.

A trigger occurred right now I am at Waffle House confessing to more of my kids that I had a Minnie trigger or spark as I call them.  I’m sad and depressed or at least it’s trying to get me but I’m countering it with counting my blessings.  I have survived homicidal parents they killed others but not me, I’m a foster father to many and my kids love me so much that even though they are out of the house I still see them regularly, also I look at my triggers as challenges to overcome not as evaluations of my faults.  We are still alive, we are grouping togather to get stronger, and we are able to do more with our condition than any other generation before.  You and I are at the forefront of discovery and you know what we are not alone their are others many many many others. Now start counting your blessings in your reply in fact everyone join in and lift yourself and the others UP and feel connected and with purpose.  Love you y’all

What I have found is medications do a little but self-nurturance does a whole lot more.

PS: The two home remedies for thrush are cow urine or apple cider vinegar either would have to be gargled.  I have never tried the cow but I get great results with the apple cider vinegar.

I used to get into relationships like your describing but then I stop wondering how I could fix them and started asking myself one very important question,  “How is this situation helping me with my issues?”  The answer was always “It’s not” then I would ask the second question, “Does that person play a significant role in my Happiness” that answer was always “No they don’t”.  A person who has been victimized can see a ‘comfort zone’ from a mile away.  When they find it they work to stay in it until they are ready to move forward and when they do it will not be with you.  At that time you’ll ask yourself, “Why do I do this to myself” which honestly was the question you should have started with however you were not strong enough  to ask yourself questions that required having a positive self-worth you had to let yourself suffer before you would let yourself learn.
