asmr,fggdxr3,t1_fgfjh5f,1580759848.0,"you're not wrong bro but best thing to do is just simply not click on the videos, they know lonely guys will watch it like ginger asmr wears lingerie (i think its called) in all her videos now so I just unsubscribed to her, people will take advantage of it tbh but I just don't give it attention its not worth it"

I'll sub to whoever if they've fucking earned it telling me to sub to someone because they're your friend or a great person gives me the opposite vibe, I was waiting for this actually I remembered a week ago you did this and was wondering what your update would be on it but I like these updates you do.
