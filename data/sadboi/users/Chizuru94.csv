Failed my first one years ago due to no motivation, I guess, but I'm on my 4th one now and won the last two, so I'll keep at it.

And I know what you mean ;) Not sure if you are a plantser, too, but I LOVE it when my characters and story evolve without much effort and lead me the way. I gotta admit, though, I didn't really write the last 3 days due to circumstances at home that make writing a lot harder and that can't be fixed, so I gotta do more today over the weekend. If you don't have any interruptions and can just write, enjoy it ;) I'm jealous of those people since I got nowhere else to go to write than at home.

And glad you got into NaNo and enjoy it as a first timer. Keep it up. Hope to see you next time, too ;) For me, NaNo is the only time I can really shut up my inner critic.

My displayed word count here is from last year (but I did make the 50k) xD"

MarvelStrikeForce,f1kryod,t1_f1kqye6,1569539529.0,"I meant it that way since every time you do the next node, the story ""continues."" It'd be weird to have it pop up again every time I go to the Raid screen (as a leader, I need to check it often to see if everyone took the right lanes.) Like, if it was just one thing Doom would say at the start of the Raid, I get what you mean, but at the start of each node, he has dialogue again.

Best would really be when they let the timer start after we hit ""close"" on the last textbox, imo. Would probably be less work for them, too, and they might even consider it.  


And agreed, yeah, that's what I'm saying. Don't let the timer run down when a textbox is still open or when we are not fighting yet. And even if someone is blocking a node. Leaders and Captains can take care of that and warn people to not do it if it occured too often. But in general, people want to do a node quickly and not block it, I guess."

I also noticed some of the documents don't have the text ""divided"" optimally. Sometimes, the next little bit will be on the next page. Could've been made better.

The controls definitely feel clunky (and I played the Souls games who hear that a lot and I don't agree there), the grabbing animation is still weird, I absolutely don't like the faces of most characters in the game.   


What eventually led to me not finishing the demo, though, was not being able to figure out how to reload a magazine or how to assign an item for quick-use. I read everything thoroughly, but can't read specific tutorial documents again to look up if I'm doing something wrong. No info I could find on the internet, too, so I just quit shortly after. The headshot animation (when they lose their head) is also weird, with the head being gone suddenly and not like it's shown on the GIF on the Steam page, sprinting is okay, but not the best, too, melee isn't fast enough to hit them before they get you or a hit isn't registered and there was something else I forgot about just now, though.  


The graphics are okay. I can see they probably put a lot of effort into it and I'm okay with them, but yeah, it's not as good as I imagined it to be ""yet."" I'll probably watch someone Let's Play it and really hope they'll fix some stuff in the future. Would be a shame if it stayed like that after they put so much effort into it and little people enjoyed it due to that. Since I for my part was pretty hyped for this game."

There are even companies who encourage pirating their games (looking at the G2A situation.)

marvelstudios,esqxput,t1_esntx2z,1562212046.0,"Yup, and, iirc, people were also killed during that. So yeah, the drones could create/project the illusions/pictures and fire/shoot like a MG."
marvelstudios,esqw3ln,t1_espmcbx,1562211051.0,"Yup, that, too. Really curious what that'll lead up to."
marvelstudios,esqw1yc,t1_espe11u,1562211023.0,"What bothers me, though, is that EDITH only replied with ""The illusions are gone/all turned off"" etc. instead of confirming or saying that he's dead. But might also be since Peter didn't specifically ask for that and just asked if this was ""real.""

&#x200B;

But yeah, I'm curious, too. Would like it more if they'd set up the Sinister 6 with Mysterio being among them, but o course him not being the biggest focus anymore."
marvelstudios,esqvwgg,t1_esphz4v,1562210935.0,"Oh, right, I completely forgot about that one (not sure how, though, the many times I've seen it.)

&#x200B;

Can't wait to see what we'll get to see on the BR, though :)

Same for Endgame."
marvelstudios,esqvncf,t1_espyfxa,1562210788.0,"tbh, I really must've missed that since I was focused on something else. There was so much going on in the movie during certain scenes, but definitely not as much as in Endgame, of course. 

&#x200B;

But thanks, going to keep an eye out next time I watch it :)"
SpidermanPS4,esqqq4p,t1_esqd33b,1562207874.0,"Literally everything? Ouch, can't imagine how that must've been :'(

But hope you enjoyed the movie regardless of that."
marvelstudios,esqngzc,t1_esp6v0z,1562206017.0,"And so memorable, imo.

I loved hearing that one theme in the credits I can't remember the name of atm."
marvelstudios,esqnb7u,t1_esop434,1562205925.0,"There where a few ""dark"" scenes in the movie where the sound came literally from everywhere. If it wasn't for you, you probably missed out on something while watching.

But yeah, those specific scenes had that, but aside from that, I didn't notice that much, too. But in those scenes, it was unexpected, came from everywhere and really caught me off guard and made it more awesome that way."
marvelstudios,esqmz2k,t3_c8piw8,1562205736.0,"I watched it in a Cineplex in Germany (3D only, though), but damn, I exactly know what parts you are talking about and I loved it. It gave the movie a whole other atmosphere and depth, imo. In short: It was definitely awesome!"
TheBlip,esqlxge,t1_esq1lxm,1562205136.0,"In any case, sorry you had to go through this. Guess sometimes, the best that we can do, is to start over."
marvelstudios,esqkiih,t1_esptwhm,1562204336.0,"I just know about Halo, Gears of War and Forza, tbh. The former two are worth it, I'd say, but yeah, definitely PS4 for me, too (and we don't own an XB1 anyway.) 

&#x200B;

I feel sad for XBox users and hope their console will shine sometime in the future again, too, even though I'm not a big fan of Microsoft, depending on what product of them we talk about."
marvelstudios,esqk7nj,t1_espfora,1562204159.0,"I'm not hungry and thought the same, actually."
marvelstudios,esqjz1t,t1_esouw0p,1562204018.0,"Hm, might be the case for my cinema, too. I really hope that wasn't the price I needed to pay for going one day early. But I feel you."
marvelstudios,esqjw8l,t1_esqjsc2,1562203974.0,"Yup, just read it. But thanks again :)

&#x200B;

Hope someone might sell their stuff online later and for not too much since I'm really a fan of this design and the figure/s."
marvelstudios,esqjr63,t1_esovc7x,1562203896.0,"The Cineplex (Germany) I went to had one for CM and A:EG, but not for SM:FFH. Now I'm jealous :'("
marvelstudios,esqjlza,t1_espvde5,1562203817.0,"Ouch, our Cineplex here (Germany) only had a Petz 2 menu and none for SM:FFH at all. I was quite sad since they had something for CM and A:EG."
marvelstudios,esqjhen,t3_c8nvy9,1562203741.0,"Where were those available? Cineplex (Germany) didn't have a SM:FFH menu (unlike last time with CM and A:EG) and I was really sad and now I'm quite jealous of that cup (especially because of that design and Mysterio.)

&#x200B;

So thanks in advance for a reply, enjoy it and thanks of sharing <3 Maybe I can still get my hands on it later online."
marvelstudios,esqhxp8,t1_espgjc5,1562202841.0,"And I'm sad they didn't have any SM menu there. They had for Captain Marvel and Endgame, though. Missed the CM menu with the awesome 3D cup (they didn't sell it anymore after the movie), but at least got my Endgame Thanos figurine and 3D cup.

&#x200B;

I saw some people got a cup with Spider-Man and Mysterio on it and I'm jealous :("
marvelstudios,esqhg0z,t1_espjh8n,1562202553.0,"I'm so jealous of people who can watch movies in IMAX. Can't here where I live, but in 3D and didn't think 3D would be so awesome with this movie :D"
marvelstudios,esqgi8o,t1_esolfif,1562202026.0,"Hm? They said ""Nightmonkey"" in the version I watched.

&#x200B;

Also, can anyone PM me what the deleted comment there actually said? I'm curious, especialyl since it go so many upvotes."
