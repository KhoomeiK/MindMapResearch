(I’m a videographer with a lot of video pals so I know I can get someone to do this for a few hundred bucks cash, and video means a lot to me). Then we sit down for a fancy sunset dinner, just the immediate family. 

The following weekend, we plan to have a huge party at the community centre with pizza and donuts, a toonie bar, and just get absolutely wild. It gives me a chance to wear my dress twice, and at this party I would have a short video played to recap our ceremony and speeches from the previous weekend!

Working from home is a bit of a blessing right now since I am able to slowly experiment with foods, and figure out what my triggers are with a bathroom at immediate access. Its strange, I've never had any major medical problems before, and I've only had one surgery in my life, last year to place a seton for a fistula, ultimately leading to my diagnosis. My meds haven't been working, I've been flaring and having little energy for the past few moths, so I'm hoping once I find the right meds/combo for me I'll be able to get used to it a little more.

I also have an 18 year old cousin who was diagnosed with UC last year (6 months before me), and he isn't used to it either. It put him in a strange position as a teenage boy who also had never had any major medical issues, to now be on Remicade infusions ever 4 weeks, and finishing his senior year from home. His meds are working for him thank goodness, but he's an athlete, so he had a lot of trouble adjusting."

Debrodniks in Kitchener is a close second but not nearly on the same level as Beechwood. Sunshine in Burlington is okay but their icing is standard royal icing so to me that ruins it. Donut Monster in Hamilton has unique flavours and their fritters are amazing (still not as good as Beechwood).
