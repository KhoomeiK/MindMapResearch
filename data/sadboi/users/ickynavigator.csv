bipolar,erusj4a,t1_erus1wj,1561295845.0,"I need you to understand that you can always have thoughts about any decision but at a point too many thoughts about it should notify you that there’s something wrong if he’s a listener then he’s actually a keeper and if you do believe you need him then you need to work on how to unneed him because you shouldn’t have so much trust and support placed on him 
It’s like imagine building a table and connecting it to the ground with only one stand there’s always going to be a possibility that the table can fall and break so you need to plant your own stands all on your own and also try not to listen to all this if you have no one else in your life only follow my advice if you have other people in your life don’t fall into a state of loneliness"

Also if you are with him because he’s s financial crutch to you then you actually need to leave him because you are only hurting yourself by becoming more dependent and before you know it you won’t be able to function
