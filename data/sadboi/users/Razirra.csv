After a year of EMDR we finally got through enough memories with the second to last session that I feel light and human and like I can just do things without worrying about them ten times first. It’s been like this for two weeks now ever since that one EMDR session. Have started referring to my life Before and after that one EMDR session aka ATOES and BTOES lol. Just like I used to say before and after DBT started working for me. 

Relationships and connections are easier. Staying present is easier. Helping people at my job is easier (and I was already good at that part). 

Still have another year of therapy to go. And I don’t have the trifecta of physical abuse it’s all emotional and medical abuse. Guess I’m shocked it made this much difference even though I noticed triggers were disappearing slowly over the course of this last year. Now it’s like 200 triggers instead of 400. And I’ll be done with all of them this time next year.

I got sick at age 16 with a mysterious illness. Every doctor I went to decided it was psychological or the stress of high school. High school was easy for me. And every time they referred us to a psychologist for further treatment (5 times, my parents believed the doctors assessment) the psychologist would assess me and say that I had some mental illness symptoms from this whole experience but it wasn’t connected to when I was having physical symptoms and there was no way my illness was somatic. 

But the doctors kept ignoring the psychologists and labeling it as somatic. Because they didn’t need to have evidence. Finally a doctor said look, you don’t look exactly like CFS patients but you also have some of the same symptoms so I’m going to diagnose you with that because your condition is clearly physical. This allowed me to experiment with treatments for fatigue and eventually realize a few that helped. Years later, a doctor discovered a new genetic disorder called MCAS. I was diagnosed with this with multiple lab tests, and other people in my family were diagnosed as well. Treatment turned my life around from having 0-3 hours of energy a day to having 8-16 hours of energy. 

I really do think there are a lot of diseases that we simply do not know about and the rational thing would be to assume “x persons symptoms could be either an undiscovered illness or psychological, we should try basic treatments for both and see if they improve.” Doctors labeling me as “just anxious” to my parents allowed them to emotionally abuse me to the point where I eventually did develop anxiety and ptsd."

I occasionally had to take 2-5 week breaks from EMDR for normal therapy with same person if I’d seen my family recently so I could be semi-stable before continuing.

adhd_anxiety,fpqzd7j,t3_gem8zg,1588837006.0,"Not worth the risk probably if you use it more than 2x per week. For some people their body adjusts to having the drug there every other day and reduces GABAa receptors. This makes it much harder to sleep, much easier to have anxiety attacks as GABA, one of the main calming agents in the body, has less effect. You don’t need to be addicted for this to happen, just for your body to become slightly reliant on the drug. You end up irritated and feeling weird on the days you don’t take it too sometimes. 

So take it too often and there’s a decent chance it makes your sleep worse and then you have to slowly taper off them and deal with your worse sleep condition. That’s why benzos are short term or occasional use only. 

I’d save your occasional use for when you really need it with the anxiety attacks. I’d try to mess with your adhd meds or try other sleep aids first. It’s good that you’re looking into improving your sleep as it does affect a lot."

Knowing who you work well with in relationships is actually essential to finding good sustainable relationships. Since most people aren’t trying to change their personalities and can’t change basic things like having adhd for example, they need to find people they work with. 

It’s a red flag sometimes, but it doesn’t mean the person can’t take care of themselves automatically. 

The main thing is to find someone willing to split emotional work and physical work. And someone who gives as much into the relationship as you do. If you find these things you don’t have to worry about making up for shortcomings because it’s still equal. 

My boyfriend doesn’t even notice messes. I can only do certain chores or I’ll cause myself tons of pain and a loss of energy.

changemyview,fpqtz0y,t3_gez1fy,1588832166.0,"I think you’re assuming that your experience of anxiety is the same as theirs, which is a common thinking error. I also think you’re blaming them for a systemic issue that lies with the testing system and professor. 

I also have anxiety. I used extra time on tests in school. I work at a residential treatment center where people try to kill themselves, attack people, or hurt people at least every week. My anxiety doesn’t interfere with this at all, because talking someone down is different than testing. The only thing it interferes with is making decisions about the long term consequences we assign for these incidents, which I have plenty of time to decide. 

You can’t assume someone isn’t fit to be a surgeon just because they need extended time on tests. Those are two different skill sets, and one is real life, while one is tied into specific anxieties about school and grades. 

The point of testing and GPA anyways is to measure what someone has learned. Their anxiety prevents their knowledge from being measured correctly during tests, presumably. Therefore it would be deflating their grades to not give them extended time. Other students have temporary issues like not enough sleep that deflate grades also through reducing accuracy of measurement, but the students with anxiety likely also experience those same random life events as other people so that’s still fair. 

I think the real danger here is that not everyone who should get extended time to accurately measure their knowledge is getting it. If you struggled with major testing anxiety and didn’t apply for accommodations then your gpa is deflated. That doesn’t mean we should ruin their GPA though as that doesn’t fix the problem. Making accommodations more accessible to everyone, and urging professors to provide enough time to accurately measure peoples knowledge on a test is a better fix in my opinion. Accommodations hugely improve graduation rates for students with anxiety, and there are studies that show extended time on tests was more beneficial to students with disabilities than nondisabled students. That same study did show that a lot of results for other issues were inconsistent because implementing accommodations varies widely at colleges. But that is a systematic issue too, and we shouldn’t punish individuals for it. 

https://nceo.umn.edu/docs/OnlinePubs/TestAccommLitReview.pdf study link

Another danger is fakers who are not actually ill, but it is very difficult to prove someone isn’t actually ill beyond what we already do. People have to officially prove disabilities/illnesses to the accommodation office already, involving medical documentation from doctors."
changemyview,fpqsg09,t3_gewcko,1588830895.0,"Body positivity does many of the same things that body neutrality does. It allows people to assess their bodies better, since we remember negative things about our bodies much more than neutral or positive. Studies show that we need 5 compliments to counter one negative comment, and fat shaming is extremely common. Positive can counter negative mindsets that slow down change and make people avoid exercise. Both mindsets are useful, but positivity is more useful considering so many people are negative towards weight. 

For people who’ve tried and failed many times to lose weight, because for some people it is genetically much more difficult, it can be freedom to enjoy their life that they do have instead of hating themselves for the same amount of lifespan. For people who are just overweight, not obese, and therefore likely to live longer than someone with a “normal” or too skinny BMI it helps them get on with their life without unnecessary shaming. https://www.webmd.com/diet/news/20090625/study-overweight-people-live-longer here’s one of the studies suggesting overweight people live longer 

Body positivity is good for people like doctors too. Part of the increased cause of death from obesity (not overweight people, remember, just obesity) is because doctors don’t take fat patients seriously. They treat their fatness before treating chronic illnesses and inflammatory disorders that shorten their lives. Some friends of mine avoid doctors because it’s such a blow to their mental health to have their major, painful, health issues that limit quality of life and ability to work overlooked in favor of the doctor harping on their weight again. Doctors dismiss them and tell them to come back after losing weight to see if it helped their symptoms. Meanwhile I, “normal” weight, go to the doctor with the same symptoms and they treat the same illness like a calamity they want to help me with ASAP. 

Body positivity could increase people’s health quite directly if it spreads to doctors and gyms."

AskWomen,fp8ymxk,t3_gbs1rm,1588407650.0,"I think you also have to consider “improve yourself so you’re capable of sustaining a psychologically healthy relationship.” Where the relationship bit is about the connection and not the individuals. So not asking a partner to change so you’re more attracted to them as an individual, but asking them to change behavior that’s driving a wedge between you. 

I guess the trick is to focus on improving behavior and skills. Like asking someone to take the trash out once a week to keep chores even is building a skill that keeps a relationship balanced. Asking someone to anticipate when you want the trash taken out is asking them to change how they think and who they are in relation to you. 

With the knowledge that sustainable relationships don’t need to be perfect. But you’re allowed to ask for things that impact the amount of work someone puts into a relationship. 

Asking someone to like relationship conversations or adopt just your communication style is changing who they are, asking them to work with you to find a way to discuss issues when you have them is not. 

If you mean supportive partners, those are nice and it feels nice when it happens. And they stop if you say you don’t want to work on that issue right now if it doesn’t impact them. Exceptions, stuff like substance abuse or abusive tendencies."

It’s more work to avoid washing the three dishes I asked her to wash all week than to just wash them at some point. And my boyfriend doesn’t get cooking and doesn’t think of expiration dates. We did split the chores more evenly but I have to tell him every week that yes I do need him to do the laundry like he agreed. 

My roommate has depression and can barely do any chores. I’m giving her that one though as a friend because she’s genuinely trying. 

Question needs a middle option. I run the household and do more than my share of chores and this stings because of the chronic illness meaning I should be doing less (I pay the same rent). But they do part of their shares with reminders. 

I think chronic illness prepares you very well for running a household though. I’m used to analyzing what I need for the day, prepping things ahead of time so I can do them while I actually have the energy (asking people to bring out dirty dishes Saturday so I can wash on Sunday etc). It’s hard to stand by and watch things fall to pieces when you can do something about it with a little prep."

Oof. Yeah I don’t think it should be necessary to have to role play to a doctors wrong assumptions about what someone with x medical condition looks like. That’s the point. Even for me who can do it it’s exhausting and can still turn to accusations of faking/hiding something since I’m pretending. 

I led a chronic illness group in college and our autistic members said similar things about doctors. Although our school was pretty good about not questioning them and giving them accommodations so it is better in some places. 

“Autistic people can’t have friends” lol guess that’s why me the allistic person is dating two of them. Honestly society hugely undervalues autistic people. They’re the only ones I feel I can really trust sometimes, much more interesting to talk to than most people, meshes well with my adhd and cptsd brain. 

The person who took over the group at college from me is autistic and has connections with the majority of the school, even if they’re fairly professional ones.

CPTSD,fov7opy,t1_fov309l,1588096725.0,"It kills me how many patients with chronic illness (1 in 5 people) are turned away and mistreated by doctors determined to root out the hypochondriacs (1 in 20 to 1 in 50 estimated). 

I’ve had to deal with this too. I’m very careful about how I present myself to doctors because I think one of them wrote “drug seeking” in my chart at one point when I was desperate for /allergy medications/. Because I kept passing out from allergic reactions.

I also am frustrated that I have to pretend to be neutrally or minimally reacting to my terrifying and painful situation in order to be taken seriously. Displaying the appropriate level of emotion for my situation leads to more doubt and then writing it off as psychological. How is “appropriate distress about the situation” not just a normal part of a diagnosis?

Edit: 
There’s a study that says 66% of people with chronic fatigue syndrome or ME felt that seeing a doctor actually made them worse due to the doctors responding dismissively.

I’ve expressed this to my girlfriend before- that I have limited resources and she has a responsibility to try and get better. I think the only part that got through was me having limited energy.

The main issue with us was life experience. We were at different part of life than her, and she was emotionally mature for her age but didn’t have the same skills and tools for emotions or communication skills that we had worked hard to learn. Depending on how mature your originally a couple is you might run into this issue. We were just patient but also she got a crash course in life and also she’s now addressing instead of ignoring her mental illness so cool. 

There was occasionally jealousy about time commitments and when people all wanted to do a two person activity. Mostly it worked out through communication and reassurance that we really all did love each other. I think she still has doubts sometimes about whether I really love her, but she also has untreated anxiety and worries about this with everyone so I’m not taking it personally. It’s easier to be sure as the original couple though I guess. 

My girlfriend was kind of too distancing. I always wanted more time with her and she always didn’t want to invite herself over because she felt like a burden if she asked. Don’t do that. Don’t treat yourself like an intruder. You’re not. And don’t take healthy boundaries about time available for spending with partners as confirmation that they don’t want you.

mastcelldisease,fo067wt,t1_fnyy8zf,1587406795.0,"I do want to point out it’s not the addiction that makes benzos dangerous for MCAS patients. It’s the interdose withdrawal and tolerance. Sometimes as you take benzos regularly your body decreases GABAa receptors to compensate for the extra GABAa activation. This leads to less receptors on the mast cells, and overall less ways for your body to deactivate or slow down the mast cells. Combine with interdose withdrawal for bad effects. Taken regularly, benzos can therefore make mast cell activation worse than before taking them. If you take them too regularly. 

I also have ptsd and anxiety and pmdd so I have multiple reasons to take them too I just want to be sure you know the risks. People usually try this method last and try other mast cell stabilizers first and so far it sounds like you’ve only tried cromolyn for stabilizers.

I’ve watched plenty of people refuse free therapy sponsored by the school or have the money and not go. I also live in a state now that expanded Medicaid and for people who are low income it’s totally covered and people still refuse to go. 

For those with multiple financial obligations and unmanaged mental illness, I wouldn’t blame them for not going to therapy. But I wouldn’t date them long term either. Because it simply doesn’t work out based on experience. That’s not a shame thing, that’s a realistic thing. I can’t manage my illness and theirs and I won’t stick around for them to take their frustrations out on me. 

I think it’s not just the financial piece though. Because I also have a girlfriend who loves getting $80 take out once a week but said therapy is too expensive. It’s also them not valuing therapy higher than other things in their life. She recently changed her mind. Suddenly the money isn’t an issue anymore. Do I mind not having take out?

mastcelldisease,fntr24x,t3_g3o2v4,1587247095.0,"It’s quite the struggle figuring out what works for us with this disease. 

Before trying benzodiazepines (which mainly act as mast cell stabilizers) why not try adding other stabilizers? Cromolyn is a stabilizer and helps the most, so why not also try ketotifen, palmitoylethanolamide, etc? For me I always do best preventing reactions than dealing with the after effects with antihistamines. 

Benzodiazepines are amazing at treating this but are risky. They can also make MCAS worse if taken too often. I’ve been taking them 2x a week for the last year and a half and it’s been fine. But I scoured the internet for anecdotal reports and it seems that out of around 50 people some of the people who take it 3x a week or more ended up worse off in the long run than before taking it.

Also I’m glad you found another doctor. Also it sounds like we’re in the same area if you’re near the U of M. Do you think you could private message me the doctors name? My last MCAS specialist just stopped taking MCAS patients :( I can give you the name of my psychiatrist who prescribes me the benzos 

Edit: I keep thinking of more things. Just wanted to offer some hope in terms of mental health- mine got a lot better once the MCAS stabilized. They’re very connected, each one makes the other worse. I stabilized to the point where I was able to do EMDR and bam, now it’s a major recovery."

I ended up having a whole list of things for my partner to avoid though and it was too much for him to remember. So I’d have the conversation about why it set me off and then the next time he did it I’d remind him and he’d restate himself a different way, the burden was on me to point it out not him to always watch everything he said.
