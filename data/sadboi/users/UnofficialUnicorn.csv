They are not coming out due to covid so you‚Äôre only option is to check inside the apartment if they‚Äôve got a black fios box and then go get a net gear router and do self install.

Otherwise try Comcast."
Fios,fqzg1cg,t1_fqz9zyr,1589766598.0,Net gear is cheaper than gateway but do what‚Äôs best for you. If they install gateway they have to visit which they‚Äôre saying they don‚Äôt want to. Maybe they can send it to you and you‚Äôd rent it or pay for it.

Fios,fqyrs3w,t1_fqwee55,1589753480.0,You can use your own net gear router or whatever. You don‚Äôt have to use gateway. You can just hook it up and say self install and ask them to turn it on from behind
