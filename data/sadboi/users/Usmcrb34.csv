bipolar2,f5uv8jz,t1_f5qdtra,1572479869.0,I get this way and I think it‚Äôs partially wanting to connect to something and also just a side effect

bipolar2,f5ut1vb,t1_f5us9eg,1572478841.0,At first it was shitty when I realized that I was entertainment for everyone due to my whacky ideas and reckless behavior rather than being a friend. The worst is when I‚Äôm manic a lot of what I say doesn‚Äôt make sense because I bounce around on thoughts so it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm saying 3 sentences at one time. And those same so called friends would just laugh at be like wtf are you talking about but at the time I‚Äôd laugh to cuz I‚Äôm flying high in my mania. Soon after the high goes away tho I‚Äôm like damn those people don‚Äôt care
bipolar2,f5us7qc,t3_dp2pod,1572478426.0,Yes this is psychosis if you want a answer to your question and I agree with the other 2 replies go to the ER and get the help you need! Message me if you need to
bipolar2,f5ur868,t3_dozumr,1572477985.0,I‚Äôm not sure if this is advice or what it is but I know exactly what you‚Äôre talking about and part of me when manic thinks that everyone is jazzed on my ideas and that I‚Äôm this super likable person but it kind of came out that it may not be that people like me while manic but they just want to see what I‚Äôm going to do next so they are around more and when depressed some people feel that they are obligated to see how you‚Äôre doing and others do genuinely care how you are doing but when I‚Äôm stable there‚Äôs no obligation towards anyone to see how I‚Äôm doing or there‚Äôs no I wonder what he is going to do next so the people disappear. This is why I have a very small group of friends that are genuinely happy when I‚Äôm stable because they know I‚Äôm not in my room with the lights off or that I‚Äôm not out partying and making a fool of myself. Not saying this is the case for you or anyone else but for me it‚Äôs just what I‚Äôve noticed in my life

bipolar2,f5upru8,t3_dpcsab,1572477315.0,Walking down an empty street in the fog but instead of being quiet there‚Äôs loud speakers that are playing multiple voices and I can‚Äôt understand them. I can see outlines of what I think are people but when I get close it‚Äôs just another mailbox or other usual street posts. I guess that would be more of a video but I could make a picture out of it haha
bipolar2,f5up5ce,t3_dp8jvg,1572477027.0,Just from that little bit of information I‚Äôd say you most likely have bp2 but don‚Äôt be afraid of it.
