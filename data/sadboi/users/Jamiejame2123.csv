depressionregimens,fm40x9w,t3_fsn7k3,1585743544.0,"I am not a doctor, but I am a medical professional, and according to research, Lithium builds brain cells and matter, and it helps tremendously with anxiety, depression, and sleep, even at lower doses. Lithium is a salt that is found naturally in the earth in different areas in the world. In places where it is found highest, there is less crime. Lithium gets a bad wrap but that is usually only in astronomically higher doses that are not monitored.  I personally take this, and it has been life-changing for me."

Every time someone has a psychotic episode or severe depression, it is like trauma to the brain. There is proof that severe depression and psychotic episodes can actually shrink the brain or cause holes.  Most importantly, psychotropic drugs do NOT take away all symptoms.  You have to get help with changing stinking thinking and therapy in combination with medication, which are proven to be most helpful.  To take steps further, it takes mind, body, and soul work.  Exercise and the right foods also helps the brain."

It has been 3 months since I've had ECT, and I can tell you for sure that it does get better.  It was like I had to train my brain to slow down, take it a day at a time, and focus on the present moment and what I was doing.  Good luck."
