(also, since i was 11, my stepmom came into my life, really rude and disrespectful person and was also there for my dads money. she also got hit and beat and they also always fought, even while she was pregnant with her first kid) about a year later.. when i was 12, my stepmom was 3 months pregnant again but tried to keep it from my dad because he didnt want another kid. but he found out.. and idk how, but he did. ahh, hey. if you want to read about it. my dads name was Ibrahim Beidari. read about it online. he was in the news. he did alott of other stuff, so read a couple of articles to get good info. anyways, we had to go live with my mom ofc, after that. when we got there.. my depression started to get worse. i started isolating alottt more, had suicidal thoughts. so i went to the hospital for the first time. dear lord did it get worse. the next time.. i went in for a suicide attempt, then the next, then the next. i went in 12 times, to the hospital. in between that, i started cutting, restricting my eating because i hated myself so so much.. i hate my body, everything. about 2 weeks ago, i went into the hospital again, but before i did, my cuts started getting deeper, i stopped eating completely. everyone distanced themselves from me, because of what i did. im so embarrassing and ugly and stupid. that happened in a span of 2 years. im 14 now. i.. i havent ate in a couple of days, tried eating today for my moms birthday.. threw it all up. everyones mood just went down then, they’re all irritated with me. im really sorry, i dont know how to type correctly my mind goes all over the place. today, i just feel sick and tired and i want to end it but i fail everytime and i cant bear to see the look of disappointment on their faces anymore. my dad called one time i was in the hospital and just started.. yelling at me, saying i was a disappointment, if i really wanted to kill myself i shouldve tried harder. he does this all the time but that time it hurt, he also said i was an attention seeker. ah, also. i have no friends, my grades are all below 40’s. i dont have any friends because my best friend, the only one i trusted, tried to hurt me.. he hurt me. he tried to r*pe me. everyone just left after that.. idk. i have so many more things to say, i have so many more things to tell you, but i dont know how to make them come out. i could never get them to come out. im so so sorry this is so long, if you make it to this point thanks for coming to my ted talk. now, after throwing up i feel sick so im gonna try to sleep. thanks alot. sorry if i say sorry alot, im just scared people are going to hate me. sorry."
