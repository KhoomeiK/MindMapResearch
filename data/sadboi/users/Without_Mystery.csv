AmItheAsshole,fr5h874,t1_fr5gv3f,1589908522.0,"Because OP is openly flaunting that they care for a dog more than their biological children, despite the fact that the kids are clearly hurt and upset?

AmItheAsshole,fr5fs8w,t1_fr5fef9,1589907844.0,"You try to explain to a child that she’s not their mom. A kid doesn’t understand that. All they know is that their birth parent didn’t want them. Like it or not, she’s their biological mother. Of course the children are going to have emotions about that. I’m not saying OP is wrong for giving up the kids, but she’s sending some serious mixed signals to them. I’d be surprised if these kids didn’t wind up in therapy over this relationship.

AmItheAsshole,fqw8t2e,t1_fqw8981,1589696184.0,"Yeah, I agree that it was wrong for her to say those things. I can just see her being very hurt that he helped his family so much and not her. If they’ve said “I love you”, which I assume they have after 2 years, she must feel like that was a lie at the moment. It’s one thing to not combine help if you’re struggling, but if you have enough to support you + your entire family? It speaks volumes about the way OP sees his gf, in my opinion."
AskWomen,fqw8faz,t3_gl9svn,1589695856.0,"I had a horrible fear of driving too OP. I got my license at 21 because if I didn’t, I’d have to drop out of college. When I got my license, I drove to student teaching and back. That’s it. I had horrible anxiety every time I drove back and forth, but I did it. Eventually I graduated and I was able to drive back and forth to my job (45 min away!) but I only felt comfortable because I practiced the roads a lot. For 3 years I only drove on the same few roads, nothing else. I’m a little better now, but even still I feel very uncomfortable driving anywhere I haven’t been before. If I have any advice for you, it’s to work in steps. Even if you have to go very slowly, it’s okay! Drive around in a parking lot for as long as it takes for you not to feel anxious doing that. (That step took like a month for me lol.) Then, drive around on a road in a loop. Do that til you’re not anxious driving that one loop. Then, it’s honestly a matter of forcing yourself. It’s scary, but you have to be acknowledge that you’ll be anxious and then do it anyway. That was the only way I was able to really start driving. I still have a ways to go, though! Hopefully one day I’ll be driving as carefree as everyone else is."
AmItheAsshole,fqw7ymb,t1_fqw7tac,1589695462.0,"I see where you’re coming from. I just see her perspective too. Him not giving the money means he doesn’t see a future with her, either. If he was going to

AmItheAsshole,fqw7lpa,t1_fqw7hx7,1589695163.0,"I think you’re assuming a lot here. There’s no reason to suggest that she’s only still with him for the money. If she loved him before, she loves him now. Idk, I can just see why she’d feel unloved if he did so much for his family but not for her. Maybe he doesn’t really love her. If that’s the case, I understand not giving the money."
AmItheAsshole,fqw6436,t1_fqw5tw2,1589693932.0,"If OP already set his entire family up for life and has money left over, we can probably assume he was a big winner. It’s possible that he won enough for running out to not be a concern. I agree he’s NTA if he doesn’t have much left, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. He just doesn’t want to support his gf. I don’t think his gf is a gold digger because she was with him long before he won any money."
AmItheAsshole,fqw52k7,t1_fqw3mxk,1589693080.0,"65k is undoubtedly a HUGE ask. I’m not downplaying that at all. But if he won enough to set his ENTIRE family up for life, then 65k will be a drop in the bucket of his earnings. I just can’t imagine setting up my entire family for life and neglecting my SO. My SO and I have actually discussed what would happen if one of us won the lotto. We both said we’d help each other AND each other’s families. I guess we’re in the minority here."
