relationships,fq22b72,t3_ggfu9f,1589052198.0,You deserve someone who won’t hide their social media from you. A relationship needs to be honest & transparent. With this relationship you’ve gained knowledge & will find someone who will tell you everything no matter if it hurts or not.

depression_help,fej7u5d,t3_epcgsb,1579160579.0,I can assure you sex is something worth waiting for. You give YOUR body to someone you want to give it to when YOURE ready. It’s not a great feeling looking back in life wishing you didn’t give yourself to someone who didn’t deserve to be intimate with you. You’re super young & 100% around the age where most teens lose their virginity. But you’re not missing out on anything. It’ll be so special & so worth it when you find someone you truly wanna give it to. I wish I was educated more on sex & how if not done appropriately can be EXTREMELY self destructive. & if you do decide to fall into the peer pressure of your inexperienced friends.. please wear a CONDOM.

TrueOffMyChest,fe68wcd,t3_enrpda,1578884360.0,One of the reasons I hated working In the restaurant industry. I would ALWAYS go above & beyond & kiss peoples butts. Of course there would be times where I felt as if I didn’t get “tipped” as much as I thought I deserved or even tipped at all & it really brought me down & made me think of myself of not worthy enough. It’s fucking sad.
college,fdrw62w,t1_fdrrks9,1578690678.0,Thanks for letting me know. Definitely one of the main reasons. I have a lot of legal problems that I have to start dealing with really soon. So I was trying to not have the worry of trying to find a way to class & back add to everything going on. On campus college is kinda out of the question due to acceptance rate/not doing program offered at my nearest community college which would make a way easier transition.

Idk I guess I was just looking for validation of where I am in life & looking for more guidance for why I should listen to my logical part of my brain. Thank you for reminding me that we are at different points in life & that doesn’t make me less of a human being. Just acknowledges one of those things I don’t remind myself everyday.
