Hey everyone. I‚Äôm going to look at this ‚Äò12 built STI tomorrow (sorry about the terrible photo, it‚Äôs from the dealer).

I literally just started going back to a therapist after not seeing one for 10 years or so (26 now). I should have gone back a long time ago. Feel like I‚Äôm barely hanging on. She believes I may have been miss diagnosed ADHD. She told me I‚Äôm absolutely in a major depression right now and wants to keep digging some more - she mentioned I might be bipolar which terrified me (it truly does have such a stigma attached to it. Never knew what it was but it‚Äôs always talked about as this ‚Äúboogy man‚Äù). But upon her explaining, I calmed down a bit. 

The miss diagnosis of adhd might make sense because I always despised all the drugs they had me try. Sometimes it would work at the beginning but then always crash and burn mentally and physically shortly after starting them. Which if I have BP, that might explain the up/down cycle - maybe inflamed by the amphetamines? Idk not a doc lol.
