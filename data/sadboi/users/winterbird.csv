Pull up a map of Florida and just go down the list. Keep in mind that you may not want to live in the absolute cheapest places you see due to area and other possible issues like vermin (cheap is cheap for a reason). Write down some average rent costs you'd expect to pay in each town.

If you are as you put it unskilled, I assume you don't have a career or a lot of experience at a blue collar job. This means you need to live in a place of reasonably decent population because you need to be able to find work.

You could live off a 30-35k salary if you only pay basic bills and don't travel, go out, don't shop... but you're being a bit fancy with expecting to cover insurance with it as well.... this is what makes it difficult to say you can do it because insurance here can be very pricey. My employer offers some basement level useless insurance at $180/mo and then the next step up which is more useful is $390/mo. 

I can't afford insurance. My basic bills without a car or insurance are $2100/mo. This is just rent, phone, electric, food, pet food, and public transit. But make your own cost of living estimate by how much rent is in your desired locations. Where I am, rent is a bit much."

I would set out the whole box of like 20 around my apartment and replace every 6 weeks-ish (second time around I wrote down where i placed them because I couldn't find them all).

It took a little while to start seeing results, but once you see deformed looking roaches it's working. Those are infertile. After the current adults die off, there'll be these forever younglings and then they'll die off too. 
So you are not stuck trying to kill off millions that are still multiplying, but you are preventing future generations.

The insect growth regulator makes future generations unable to grow into mature adults. Pest control use this ingredient in their sprays also. It's important to keep replacing the IGR discs or applying the solution even after you stop seeing roaches, because what wanders into your home at any point needs to be affected. This is super important in apartments or houses with close neighbors."
