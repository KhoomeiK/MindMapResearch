WifeHacks,ffqpy8k,t3_da9plz,1580140914.0,Lately Ive tried a few things that really work but might not work for everyone wife. Try telling her you miss her or you are thinking about her at different times of the day. Figure out her love language.  If watching Jane Austin movies is what makes her happy then suck it up and watch them with her.  If doing chores for her makes her happy then do it.  If leaving her post it notes telling her she is beautiful makes her happy then do it but do it all sincerely.  Works great for me lately.

BipolarReddit,f4askv2,t3_dk21jx,1571500675.0,"Great posts, Im bipolar, still have mania now and then, doc says its controlled for the most part with meds, Im not a drinker, havent been but I have other vices Ive overcome and still overcoming,

 I recently joined a FB group called Rave Sober, its a cool group of supportive people who like to party without drugs and alcohol.  Maybe check it out."
BipolarReddit,f37b1ob,t1_f35nrtf,1570723711.0,"The other thing that helped me is I created this spreadsheet to track all my projects.  I saw I had like 30 or 40 projects I was working over the course of 5 or more years.  Some projects I began to question the return on investment of time and money so I created columns in that sheet or even another spreadsheet with like whats the short term reward and whats the short term cost, long term costs and long term rewards.  I realized that like becoming a level 120 whatever in a video game had short term rewards and long term losses, whereas getting a masters degree in data science is hard initially but has long term rewards of feeling good about myself and helping increase income and helping my kids know I am still learning things etc, so when I weighed my choices and projects like that it became easier to focus althougb i still work on some projects over a long time some I quit."
BipolarReddit,f35qkl1,t1_f35nrtf,1570686318.0,"Well, it may sound corny but a while ago before that Marie Kondo lady became famous on Netflix I read her book and basically shes like, throw things out that dont bring you joy, or that bring you bad feelings.  So ive started to look at it this way.  If i only have a short amount of time, just turned 40 last month, and  there the potential to buy back things or replace them is more valuable than to waste  my time worrying about failed projects.  Time is worth more than than the stuff laying around. I can save the time and spend that on people around me, or future projects and chuck the stuff that takes up physical space.  This has kind of made me a digital hoarder but at least i can manage digital space a little easier than physical space.  Not sure if this is making sense. Also, my digital projects I have been able to pick back up and work them now and then or i look at them later and go, wow, glad I didnt waste any more effort on that.."

BipolarReddit,f35ko21,t3_dfr2fz,1570680542.0,"It can be a bipolar or adhd thing or both or neither. I think the trick is to find things you will come back to that act as therapy.  I have written, produced songs on and off since high school. I used to have dreams of success. Now i have come to terms that my music is my therapy and if someone else enjoys it, great, i dont have to impress anyone but just have fun with it.  Little projects that help me relax are a good thing whether i finish them or not. Ive decided its ok to just throw something away if i dont finish it.  Its cathartic.  But being manic had helped me complete things during tight deadlines like patents, stuff for work or personal family projects.  Its the crash after the mania that can be rough."
edmproduction,f0kvq6z,t1_f0kefbl,1568689392.0,They sent out an email from Cymatics to join the private FB group.  I think they will have some more.  Maybe dig through your email or spam folder.
edmproduction,f0k1pm7,t1_f0j82zp,1568668148.0,"Thanks for the kudos in the comment! I believe all those vocal chops are straight out of San Holo's Cymatics Vibrance pack.  I dropped them into ableton simpler since I only  have Ableton Standard, not Suite.  I played the chops on my new oxygen keyboard.  I'm slowly upgrading stuff over time.   Some people weren't that impressed with the Vibrance pack, but I'm really enjoying it."

aww,ey4jgh7,t1_exk12mn,1566794473.0,Gary and Charles would be great names for my female sister cats.  Instead my kids called them Mittens and Whiskers (snore).  I call them Minmins and Friskers or some variations on the theme.  I do wonder what they're thinking or not thinking about.. thanks for the reply!
