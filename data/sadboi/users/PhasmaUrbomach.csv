Her romantic life is a disaster. She is in no position to give Molly advice, especially when she hasn't bothered to listen to Molly and has shown nothing but skepticism about her relationship with Andrew. Her advice not to invite Andrew to Thanksgiving was bad.

> Issa isn’t actively dating, therefore her romantic life isn’t a mess.

Really? The throuple BS with Condola and Lawrence isn't messy to you?

> Issa has no indication that molly has changed her ways to give her credit for anything.

This is not how friends act. Issa has been so rude about Andrew that Molly doesn't even want to confide in her. Issa needs to listen to Molly instead of blowing her off and avoiding the conversation.

> Keep in mind, Molly tried to end her thing with Andrew before they became exclusive because he was still dating around.

Never said Molly wasn't also a mess, but she is actively trying to do better, while Issa 100% is not.

> molly was still up to her self sabotaging fuckery.

She didn't do it, did she? Have you never been dating and gotten sad and defeated when this person you're really into is dating other people? It's normal. You confide that to your best friend so you can talk it out before you make a mistake.

> You’re comparing two vastly different situations as if they’re the same. Issa doesn’t want to date because she doesn’t have time to. Does mean her romantic life is “failed.”

I guess you could say this if you completely ignore the jacked up love triangle is in choosing to be in right now. I can't ignore it, so Issa looks really messy to me."
