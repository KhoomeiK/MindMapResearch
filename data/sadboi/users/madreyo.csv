In slavic culture there's this pre-christian forest demon called ""lasownik"" who is a guardian of the woods and often makes random travelers lose their way home. The only chance to stop his 'evil magic' is to turn a piece of your clothing inside out or wear your left shoe on your right foot. It's really interesting how we were taught the same/similar thing about getting lost in the forest, even though our cultures are very different!"
