Sourdough,fqx06ip,t3_gle8sv,1589722586.0,It almost still looks under-done? That one section in the middle at least. Which seems strange if you  baked for a total of 60m at that temp. Do you happen to have an oven thermometer to see if your oven is truly getting up to temp?
askatherapist,fqef20r,t1_fqdvqi4,1589306480.0,"Gotcha! Thanks for clarifying. I definitely see how it’d hard to engage or interject if she is constantly talking, especially if you feel that she doesn’t like you. A basic tenant of the therapeutic process is holding unconditional positive regard for clients, and it sounds like she doesn’t make you feel like she is following that. It’s also more challenging the more time has passed to address issues. Is there space at the beginning of your sessions to maybe say things you’d like to talk about? Or maybe if you wrote the topic down on a list and showed her that you’ve come with things on your mind you’d like to discuss? Again, it seems like there are a few things that you’re struggling with in regard to this therapist (feeling like she dislikes you, that you aren’t able to discuss what you want to, and that she constantly talks and talks over you) and if you don’t feel like you’re able to use the space how you feel will be most beneficial for you it might be best to look for someone new?"
askatherapist,fqdg4v4,t3_gi9rqe,1589288922.0,"Hello! I’m sorry to hear that your therapist talks over you and that it doesn’t seem like you’re getting what you need out of your sessions. When you first started seeing them did they ask about your goals for therapy? I’m wondering if you’ve tried to talk about the assault that brought you to therapy and they’ve redirected the conversation or if neither of you have brought it up? As a therapist, it’s always important for me to identify goals upfront with the client so we both have an understanding of the intention of our time together and what they want to get out of it. If working through that and symptoms of PTSD stemming from the assault are a goal you have, then it seems strange that it’s never been spoken about. However, if you haven’t attempted to bring it up and it wasn’t addressed as a goal, the therapist might be taking your lead about the things that are on your mind to talk about. If that’s the case I would suggest saying, “hey, this is something I’ve been thinking about and would really like to start discussing with you.” If it’s been set as a goal and hasn’t been discussed yet, maybe something like, “I’d really like to revisit the goals we set at the beginning and start discussing xyz.”

Both of those statements really only work if you feel that you continue to want to see the same therapist. If you’d rather seek out a new therapist because you don’t feel like this person is a great match, that’s ok too! I always tell people that finding a therapist is like finding a good pair of shoes. You might have to try on a few pairs before you get a comfortable fit! And it’s perfectly ok to two a therapist that you don’t think it’s working out with them!"
socialwork,fq9glsb,t3_ghlio5,1589197613.0,"I’m in the northeast US and just got my MSW in 2019. I know that many people in my program felt like they had to make a big adjustment in the way they spoke, especially about populations they hadn’t worked with before. Seconding the above comment that the most important thing is to use person first language. So not a “disabled person” but a “person with a disability.” The purpose for this is that people are so much more than a disability they have and when you use a label first that’s all people hear. I would never say physically or mentally challenged or handicapped, as these are pretty outdated terms. It’s also important to defer to how someone refers to themselves however, and different communities have reclaimed language and terms that once were used offensively towards them in an effort to reclaim that power. 

I think trying your best is the most important thing. In my classes we always set group norms at the beginning to make sure we addressed what class expectations for how we treated each other. One that often came up  was “permission to speak as a draft” and “assuming best intentions” so that if someone said something that made others cringe, we would all assume that person was doing their best with the current information they had and use it as an opportunity to have a discussion about how it could be said differently. A professor that I had multiple classes with said she always “speaks with a comma, not a period, so that when she gets new information she is able to change her opinion.” 

A quote that has always stuck with me is from Maya Angelou, “you do the best you can until you know better and once you know better, do better.”"

Sourdough,fpco0x9,t1_fpc785m,1588507544.0,Thank you! I will definitely experiment with creating the stiffer starter. I definitely had better results in general when my ratio was a little more flour heavy so that seems like a great starting place
Sourdough,fpcnyg3,t1_fpb64xw,1588507476.0,Thank you! I noticed a hooch on mine too and was thinking maybe I should’ve fed it again while in the fridge quicker

LifeProTips,fp477sy,t1_fp2kxw4,1588293069.0,My German Shepard hated the low battery beep of the detector so much and one day I got home and realized it had been going off while I was gone. As soon as I opened the door she started out and ran all the way to our neighbors horse pasture. So thankful to get her back and that she didn’t get kicked!

traderjoes,fp0i25r,t3_g9eiae,1588209692.0,Bought this the other day after seeing this post! I made sourdough bread and put goat cheese on a piece and toasted it for 5ish min in the toaster and put a good amount of this on top... so good!!

socialwork,fojcdbw,t3_g7fwxo,1587816587.0,"100% you should be getting hazard pay. I have my MSW and work as a clinician for an organization that is currently paying all of our residential workers that are continuing to work face to face with clients 1.5x their base pay plus any shift differentials. It goes up to 2x base pay if clients are covid-19 positive. Another similar, but slightly smaller, mental health agency in our county that has residential and a hospital diversion program is not offering a similar pay increase at that agency, which doesn’t feel fair. 

I think you gather as much information that you can get about similarly positioned agencies and you use that to advocate! Your work is incredibly necessary and you should be compensated as such during this time where you are at an increased risk of exposure."
ContagiousLaughter,fogjxu9,t3_g74rom,1587753517.0,"My partner and I once had an argument like this over the odor balls we keep in our winter boots because we hadn’t been able to find them for months and then all of a sudden they were in my boots one morning when I went to put them on. The same boots that I’d been wearing everyday for months. I was so confused and assumed he had found them and put them in my boots, but when I mentioned it he had no idea what I was talking about. Then we were both like “wtf was it me?” but also still thinking it was the other person. Just laughing and not sure what to make of anything. Still an unsolved mystery!"

therapy,fo8k05o,t3_g68q8w,1587598053.0,"I know quite a few people that didn’t want to try teletherapy but then decided to give it a try now. I’ve had 3 appointments with my own therapist this way and though it’s not my favorite (the silence seems more awkward and I feel weird if I pause and she is lagging so seems like she’s just staring at me) it has been nice to still see her and have time to talk and process all that’s going on. I am also a clinician and have been seeing my own clients via telehealth and had a few say no when I first offered, but then reach out to me and say they think it could be helpful and I was happy to hear from them and didn’t judge at all that they’d initially said no. We are all going through this weird rollercoaster of emotions throughout this pandemic and all handling it differently. No judgement for where you’re at! I say reach out."
socialworkjobs,fo8bvz2,t3_g677a3,1587593614.0,I graduated with my MSW last year after completing a BS in Psychology! My focus has always been kids and families so I chose to work substitute shifts for a local mental health agency in one of their residential programs and their inpatient hospital diversion/crisis stabilization program. This was nice because I could sign up for shifts when I was able to around my internship and other part time job and was still getting experience in the field and working with folks in acute crisis.
Anxietyhelp,fnvwn08,t1_fnvt7kn,1587306501.0,I’m really sorry that happened. It sounds like a pretty terrible situation and I’m sure very unsettling to know that your boyfriend didn’t let you know or give a warning. I’m glad that you were able to find a therapist and make an appointment with them. I hope it gets better for you soon!
Anxietyhelp,fnvjp2x,t3_g40huh,1587295832.0,"I’m sorry that happened to you, that sounds really icky :( It sounds like since you didn’t know the mashed potatoes had weed in them that maybe someone else made them? I’m wondering if you feel worried to eat food that you prepare or only food that you don’t know the origin of/can’t be sure is safe from any unknown ingredients? Could you potentially try to prepare most of your meals yourself for a few weeks? Or keep a few foods you know to be “safe” always on hand in case you aren’t able to eat something that someone else made? I also think reaching out to a therapist could be helpful so that they can help work with you to find strategies and coping skills for calming yourself when you are starting to feel anxious. That definitely sounds like a hard experience and I think finding someone that is skilled in working with people with anxiety could really be helpful, along with trying to ensure you know the origin of your meals so it feels safer to eat as you are working through the anxiety piece. Eventually you will be able to branch out to eating meals that you don’t have to investigate so thoroughly."
Sourdough,fntrxpb,t3_g3vme6,1587247534.0,"Thanks! I just started it 4 days ago and day 2 it was looking great (definitely doubled in size, very bubbly on top) and since then it has been pretty watery. From the few responses so far it seems maybe I should be changing the ratio of discard to new flour and water. I’ve really not been discarding much so far"
