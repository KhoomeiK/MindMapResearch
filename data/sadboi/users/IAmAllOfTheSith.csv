Contacting support can be glitchy at best because they don't always understand what you want and you can go around for hours with them not understanding.

Wag also has been notorious for ""miscalculating"" paychecks, so it's up to you to keep track of your earnings and make sure you're being paid right. If the owner has two or three dogs but only reported one, tell Wag you need the payment fixed.

Plus, he's not just disappointed that you aren't home. He completely disrespected and berated you because he either a) forgot you told him you were traveling or b) didn't want to believe you wouldn't be home. Either way, there's no excuse for speaking to you in such a demeaning manner. Does he regularly speak to you this way?

NTA by the way, I didn't include it in the original comment."

Super NTA because he was overreacted to you not being available. He's a big boy and can make his own meals."

Holy shit mate. Get a doctor *and* a therapist.

ESH, only because you have both allowed this to go on for so long. You aren't TA for trying a new tactic on your kid, but seriously? A year and a half?"

I love all the posts that suggest donating money to charities that help PoC or the LGBT+ community. He may have earned the money, but he clearly doesn't have the maturity to spend it in a reasonable way. I can see why taking the money seems harsh, but consider that his behavior is one of the Big Inexcusable Things and needs to be dealt with differently than if he cheated on a test or something."

This is extremely weird. I agree with people mentioning it might be a power thing. OP definitely needs to have a sit down conversation about what the fuck is going on here because it's both unhygienic and disrespectful to continually treat someone this way."

You asked what people do to help themselves. I personally spend time researching depression and how it works. I've always really liked science and learning new things. Knowing how chemical imbalances can trigger mood swings helps me remember that this isn't me. It isn't my fault that I am the way that I am. It's about how my body was made and how it sometimes screws up. I don't know if that works for everyone, but it's sure awesome for me."
