Don't worry too much about the ""bipolar"" diagnosis, but rather that you are getting the right treatment to make you and your life better.  There's a few forums here for bipolar as well you might want to check out.  Also, FWIW - about 60% with bipolar have alcohol and/or other substance addictions.  There's a significant overlap, and if one is caught inside of it, then both issues need to be addressed, not just one or the other.  Sounds like you're on the right track though.

BipolarReddit,etfacqn,t3_cbewj7,1562764818.0,"I'd be very surprised if not spending money was the only reason for not diagnosing BP.  Like others have said, it's only one of many symptoms.  Sounds like a inexperienced or poor psychologist to me.

FWIW, here's something I did in my early 20's.  I was fed up and pissed, so one night I just packed a backpack and left Philly to head as far south as I could.  Went to airport, but tickets were too expensive.  So took a train to Baltimore (as far as it would go that night).  Then I walked for hours and hours in the middle of the night to almost Washington DC.  Then I thought it might be a bad idea.  So I hitchhiked my way back to Baltimore.  Took a train back to Philly.  But according to your physiologist, that wouldn't be BP because I didn't splurge on a plane ticket but wanted to save money by taking the train, walking, hitchhiking LOL!

I digress.  I hope you get good help and clarity, but yes, you can still save money and have BP."
BipolarReddit,etaa92q,t3_capxga,1562615719.0,"I first went to a therapist when I was severely depressed.  She pretty quickly tagged me as bipolar and referred me to a psychiatrist to get on meds.  The meds that were prescribed more or less confirmed bipolar.

When you see your therapist, just be open and honest and try not to leave anything out.  Everything is confidential, and the more you are comfortable sharing, the better they can help you, regardless if you have bipolar or something else.  The important thing is to feel better.  All the best to you!"
bipolar,eta9w44,t3_cap7r4,1562615489.0,"I drink an Ensure (high protein) in the morning and typically a large fruit shake in the afternoon.  With healthy meals, I get more than enough vitamins and minerals.  No notable negative interactions with the lithium.  If anything, the added fluids help keep me hydrated, which is important with lithium.

From the list you provided, I'd be most interested in the fish oil.  Do you take that for anything specific?  Or as another preventative supplement?"
running,esp3igc,t3_c8omwt,1562178368.0,"Yes, your shorter runs should absolutely be run slower, unless they are specific tempo, interval, or other intensity training runs.  You will gain more aerobic development (and stamina, aka endurance) from the slower runs over time, and it will allow you to add more volume (don't think more miles, but rather more time running).  For hot / humid weather, you will naturally add a minute per mile or so to all your runs, so don't be discouraged about that.

FWIW - During one training cycle, I averaged 9:30 pace on my easy runs.  Long runs were a bit faster at 9 min/mi.  My marathon pace at the end of the cycle was 7:54 pace.  It doesn't seem logical, but if I didn't train slower, I wouldn't have the stamina (endurance) to race that long that fast.  Wish you the best!"
BipolarReddit,esouk0b,t3_c8q188,1562174432.0,"Yikes, I'm really sorry about all you had to go through in your life.  While different, a lot of it resonates.  First, are you in the r/CPTSD sub?  I think your bipolar is in large part due to the hell you went through in the early part of your life, and still haunts you to this day.

I don't have any real specific advice to give you or ""quick fixes"" to help you feel any better.  Given that I have had a shit childhood, abusive alcoholic parent, a minority raised in a small white rural town, then found out I was bipolar.... none of these things are independent of the other, and unfortunately, I have to deal with all of them.  There's no cherry-picking one over the other, because it's a constant game of wack-o-mole.

But one thing my therapist did tell me, when I told them that I also try my best to be good to others and those I care about, is that I need to be good to myself first.  It's kind of a selfish perspective, but it does make sense in that a healthy person can be more helpful to others.  I hope that helps a little.  Wishing the best for you!"

Hopefully benadryl will do the trick, but if it gets worse you may need prednisone treatment.  But be very careful with prednisone (or any other steroid)... it's like crack for those with bipolar.

bipolar,eso584m,t3_c8lfa7,1562160014.0,"Sorry to hear what you're going through, especially your parents' views.  I hope in time they come around.  Definitely follow what your doctor prescribes and more importantly tell them how you are responding to lithium and/or anything else they may prescribe.  It can take a bit of tweaking and re-tweaking the meds to get them to help.

Feeling like a failure, especially where you are in your life, is expected but it does not have to be that way.  Hopefully the right medications will help.  I was where you are over 20 years ago.  Since then, I've done well in both academics and career, so it can be done.  All the best to you!"
running,eso0v79,t1_esnqdb5,1562156741.0,"Yes, finding both easy and harder trails to train is a great approach so you can plan easy days versus days with intensity.  On my harder trails, I like to treat them like fartlek or hill interval runs and attack them as such.

Regarding trail ultras, like I said, it's all relative.  In road racing, distance is what everyone focuses on.  In trail running, it's more about effort and time (this is worth repeating - think effort and time) and distance becomes much less relevant.  

My first big mountain race was only 28K (\~17.5 miles) and I was in great aerobic shape, good enough to run a 3:30 marathon.  I went into the mountain race way too confident in my aerobic abilities.  It chewed me up and spit me out.  I barely stayed ahead of the cutoff and finished 11th to last place and I took over 8 hours to finish.  That's twice as long as a ""bad"" marathon for me.  The lesson is that I was not trained to race in those mountains and in those conditions, regardless of my aerobic fitness.  Koop's work will help you train for those other factors.   You're on the right track though and asking great questions!"
bipolar,esm8o31,t3_c856vr,1562100408.0,"Yeah, when I was first diagnosed bipolar, I disagreed with it after researching.  Eventually I stopped taking all meds.  I hope you fare better than I did.  Wish you the best!"
running,eslxl1r,t3_c87e5h,1562094157.0,"I fall into both camps (HRM vs no-HRM) but for different reasons.

If you are trying to maximize performance in a road marathon, then I think the HRM to *help regulate* perceived effort is an invaluable tool as it will help you stay in the right aerobic training zone to maximize aerobic development and performance.  I ran my best marathon from a Hadd HR-based training cycle.

On the other hand, I'm a big fan of Jason Koop for training for trail / mountain ultras (note - there are some pretty tough races out there that don't come close to 26.2 miles, so distance is very much relative).  Training for these types of races is different.  I'd suggest reading one of his books, as I won't get into the why's.  But if you can run a 10K trail run and feel good afterwards, then I think you're doing pretty good regardless of how you handle the hills.  In either case, more days running per week, and more miles running per day will always equate in better performance, so long as you stay healthy and uninjured.  Good luck!"
BipolarReddit,eskucju,t3_c8907a,1562073726.0,"Sorry to hear you had to deal with that.  My guess is that therapists are human too and inherent with all the flaws, including stereotyping in their mind on what bipolar ""should be"".  Good that you fired her.

Those close to me in my life would never have known I was bipolar if I didn't tell them, because I don't exhibit the ""CRAZY things"" that your therapist said.  But I'm lucky to have had good therapists who could see my patterns on top of my low-key and introverted personality.

In any case, I hope you're able to find good and competent help.  Having to battle those who are there to help you really sucks.  All the best to you."
BipolarReddit,esksa9b,t1_esjbm9t,1562072512.0,"Thank you.  And you are correct in that I do not fear death, but knowing that does bother me a lot, mostly because it's not normal.  And you are right in that it can put the rest of my life in a different (and better) perspective.  We'll see."
bipolar,esi83lc,t1_esi242k,1562008614.0,"What is setting you back in seeing a therapist?  I think having (the right) therapist is very important in getting better.  While only a doctor can prescribe meds, an experienced therapist can help you determine if it's working or not, or if you need more time on them.  Also, my therapists determined my diagnosis as BP before my psychiatrists did, mostly because they had more time to  know me, my past experiences, and recognize the patterns.  Glad you have a positive spirit.  Keep it up!"

Regardless of if you are bipolar or not, the important thing is to get the right treatment and help.  You are also still pretty young, which can make a difference.  I wasn't diagnosed until my mid-20's, but your experiences do resonate with me when I was your age.  All the best to you!"
BipolarReddit,eshy8jh,t1_esht421,1562003264.0,"Haha! (re: Freudian slip)

True that I'm not terminal at this point.  Regarding my sadness, I think it's that I'm not sad for myself, but I'm sad for those around me whom I know love and care about me.  I would be less sad if I knew they weren't there or didn't feel the way they do.

To put it another way, if I decide that I will do everything I can to fight this cancer, it won't be for me but for them, so they would feel less pain.  I've already had a lifetime of pain, so what's a few more years to endure?

Anyway, thank you for your understanding.  It's just nice to know we're not alone out there."
bipolar2,es9yesy,t3_c6nnjd,1561747347.0,"It really depends.  My wife didn't know about my having bipolar for more than 12 years after we started our relationship, because it was (for the most part) not an issue.  Sure, it reared its ugly head now and then, but we dealt with it.  Only when it became a very serious issue did I finally tell her, and by then she had already accepted and loved me for who I am anyway.

If you think it causes or will soon cause a serious issue in your relationship, then it might be wise to discuss.  If it's being managed through meds, therapy, etc. then there's no need to say anything now or in the near future.  The important thing is that you and whomever you are dating enjoy each other and want to continue to develop a relationship, regardless of what we have.  All the best to you!"

bipolar,es70i9w,t3_c66tgz,1561661317.0,"If possible, can you ask for another level test?  28.4C is pretty warm, but it also depends on the humidity level, what you do during the day, and how much you sweat that factor into your lithium levels.

During warm and hot weather, I'm inside an air conditioned environment most of the day, but I will run 1-3 hours outside and sweat A LOT.  This might actually decrease my lithium levels as the lithium salts will excrete from my blood via sweat along with water and other salts.

On the other hand, if I'm in a warm but very low humid environment, I won't sweat that much, but I will lose water via my lungs but not lose any salts including lithium, so this may increase my lithium blood levels.

Both warm environments, but different outcomes depending on humidity and what activities I do.  Hope all works out for you - but you look ok from the May test though."

But yeah, it wasn't easy to convince them that it ""wasn't in my head"" just because I was on lithium.  Even the anesthesiologist asked why I was taking lithium.  I said, ""mood stabilizer.""

But seriously train for the conditions you will encounter as described on their website.  Soaking feet after 10 miles is one thing.  Soaking feet after 50 miles is something completely different.   But as they say in the website, it will be more of a mental challenge than physical one, so preparation and planning is critical!"
running,eryf7y3,t3_c4tcll,1561407203.0,"Why not?  Too difficult to recommend training advice other than try to train on similar terrain with similar elevation and weather conditions, if possible.  Looking at the race info, altitude shouldn't be a problem (highest looks to be 2292m) but that time of year, who knows what the weather will be like, so prepare for any of the extremes.

In ultra races, it's always the x-factor that gets me, and not the lack of fitness.  I ran a 3:26 marathon.  In my first 24 hour trail race, I dropped after 17 hours and 57 miles due to excessive cold downpours and ensuing mud bringing pace to a crawl with exhausting effort and stomach issues.  In a 30 hour race where I tried to reach 100, I dropped after 11 hours and 44 miles, because it was so hot (up to 90 deg F) and humid, that I eventually developed chaffing of the balls (despite all the body glide I applied). I could barely walk due to the pain.  And in my first mountain race, only a 28K but 2,400 m elevation gain up to 3,330 m in altitude, the altitude and heat brought on dehydration and heat exhaustion.  At one point I could only manage 1 mile in a single hour and I finished 11th to last place out of 395 finishers in 8 hr 21 min.

But it's these other factors that bite you in the ass that make ultras fun, so don't let my experiences distract you.  Rather, I'm warning you that fitness is just one variable, and in many cases, not the one that determines success or failure in these races.  I hope you go for it, and if you do, good luck!"

Regarding your theory, I say sure, give it a shot.  But keep your theory in mind when you do it.... you're trying to out-last the prey, not out run them.  In other words, last longer, not be faster.  So when you do run, don't try to go too fast.  Keep a steady pace, or even take walk breaks if you feel winded.  Nothing wrong with that.  Another thing to try is to run by time and not distance.  Go for 30 minutes for a while.  Then build up to 45 min, then 60 min, etc.

Your theory does have merit though.  I've been an endurance runner for 6 years now and I can run for 4+ hours on a training run.  And I've done quite a few ultra marathons between 5 and 17 hours.  Still haven't caught my bunny though ;-)  But I'll still try."

Of course, nobody wants to be alone, yet it sounds like you're obsessed with this.  I've been there, and I know.  Yet sometimes freeing yourself from dependence upon another person can be what truly lets everything go.  Much much easier said than done, I KNOW.  But instead of constantly focusing on these other people, try to imagine yourself without them.  They are people, and just as fallible as anyone else, you and me included ;-)"
BipolarReddit,eq03yhp,t1_epx145x,1559677843.0,Me too.  Just one.
BipolarReddit,eq02joc,t3_bwqucc,1559677137.0,"Sorry to hear you're going through this.  One of the things I'm observing in reading what you posted is that everything stems from relationship issues with other people.  In other words, taking meds, lifestyle changes, not drinking, going to the doc, etc. are not helping, but it's people in your life and your relationship with them that appear to be bringing you down.  One of the things I've learned over my lifetime is that the only person I can control is myself.  Are you talking to a therapist?  Even if you're on the right meds, exercising, etc.  any strain in a relationship can trigger really bad mood changes from my experience.  Hoping the best for you!"
bipolar2,epdkz4e,t3_bujmwk,1559168353.0,"I know exactly what you are saying.  I wasn’t on prescription meds for 20+ years, but I self medicated with alcohol precisely because it was faster to take effect.  But it built up to a breaking point for me.  I started drinking at 6 AM until I went to bed.  As you say, I wasn’t tipsy drunk or an obnoxious drunk.  I went to work every day and I ran after work too.
But it eventually caught up to me and started to take a physical toll on my health.  I’m still trying to stop, but regular meds don’t work so quickly as you know.  Wishing you the best to figure it out."
bipolar,epd6fm7,t3_budwt1,1559162525.0,"Yes.  Recently, my therapist said I was bipolar 1.  I asked why she thought that, since I thought I was 2.  And she said that manic behavior is all I talked about.  I asked what defined ""manic"" behavior, and she said to ask myself if any normal person would have done the things I've done.  I made a list and it was quite long.  Shit, I thought it was normal all along."

bipolar,ep61jer,t3_btxyla,1559063490.0,I agree with the others and don't let your therapist change your career path.  They're a therapist and not a programmer.  I've worked in IT for over 20 years and have done my share of coding.... guess you can say I'm management now and work closely with software engineers.
stopdrinking,ep60367,t1_ep5yxku,1559063001.0,"I understand your concern.  It really depends on the therapist.  If they are good then they'll know these things coexist.  I had to find a therapist who can treat dual-diagnosis (mental health and addiction).  Not all therapists are trained or experienced in these.  In any case, I don't think you'll need to start all over.  Maybe think of it as continuing progress?"

bipolar,eony1gt,t3_bsc12r,1558724402.0,I agree to keep an eye on it.  About 5 weeks into Lamictal (lamotragine) I developed a severe reaction that landed me in the ER and hospital for 6 days.

I recently started therapy again and my therapist never said anything like what you described.  Also, with a good therapist, they should figure out your mental health issues on their own just by you describing what's troubling you now.  All the best to you!"
bipolar2,eonw0ig,t3_bskf82,1558722953.0,"Sounds like you need a second or even third opinion.  Not all docs are necessarily good docs.  Regardless if you're BPII or not, the important thing is to find the right meds to feel better.  All the best!"
running,eonssk4,t3_bsjxkb,1558720660.0,I agree.... sounds like you probably need to slow down your training runs.  You might want to check out one of Brad Hudson's books on training for endurance.  You need to be 80/20 with your easy paced / faster paced runs.

I'm married and known my wife for over 12 years.  I never told her I was bipolar because I was able to manage it.  Only recently, when the bipolar monster woke up that I told her.  But we've been together for so long now, it didn't change who I am as a person to her, and she loves me just the same (as I do her).

And there is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of!  At some point, you will see this as an integral part of who you are as a person and embrace that, even though you still need to manage it.  All the best to you!"
bipolar,eonjz4a,t1_eoniika,1558714389.0,"Be VERY careful and keep an eye on it.  Go back to the ER if it gets worse.  Also, prednisone (a steroid) can push you in a manic state after a few days.  I was prescribed prednisone to treat an allergic reaction to lamotragine (generic Lamictal) and it sent me on a 5 day manic rampage.  I was lucky I didn't end up in a psych ward.  Hoping the best for you!"
bipolar2,eonj8ew,t1_eokgvsz,1558713863.0,"Very glad to hear you were able to get good help and quickly!  I don't think I had any issues with the liver, kidney or other organs, nor did I have a fever or other DRESS syndrome symptoms (from what I've read).  But it could have been DRESS, since I absolutely needed medical treatment.  After 2 days in the hospital, I stopped drinking anything because the mouth was too sore, and it was impossible to eat anything.  I wouldn't have lasted without fluids via IV.

Yes, I absolutely agree with your advice for anyone taking Lamictal!"
running,eonipag,t1_eomy3vh,1558713485.0,"Variety definitely helps to mix things up, but it's not necessary for endurance.  For my Half marathon PR, I did something like 4 total miles faster than my race pace during that training cycle.  But like I said, mixing things up doesn't hurt.

running,eomvsrf,t1_eomhgeb,1558697197.0,"Glad you found it useful!  I've gone through multiple cycles of Hadd's training method.  Here are a few take-away's from my own perspective:

1. I don't start Hadd (HR) training until I have at least a solid 35-40 mpw base.  Until then, I can run however hard or easy I wish.
2. If and only if I get it right, the training paces will be progressive at constant HR.  Meaning, it will be slower early in the cycle, then it will get faster as weeks pass with the same HR.  This is the only training plan that I know of that will have a progressive pace through the cycle.
3. I did these on 6 running days (versus 7 as Hadd describes), which worked.
4. My marathon PR was based on 9:11 min/mi average training pace.  I ran the race at 7:54 min/mi pace and negative split the race.  So it definitely works!"
bipolar,eojxpa4,t1_eojr7zz,1558644341.0,"I'd say continue to see what your psychiatrists think.  Sometimes it can take time to figure out the right diagnosis.  I'm not a doctor, so I can't say anything about your diagnosis.  But provide detailed feedback on how the meds are affecting you so they can make the right adjustments.  Don't hesitate to say anything!

Regarding daily life, everyone is different, so my daily life is probably not like so many of others who are bipolar.  To give you an example, I've gone 20 years without doctor prescribed medication.  But I kept some semblance of balance through endurance running and drinking alcohol.  Again, not typical but that's what I did and it worked.  Until it didn't work anymore.  I'm back on meds now.

Regarding relationships, when the relationship is strained, then it's REALLY strained.  For me, relationships can be a huge trigger for both manic and depressive phases.  Fortunately, I've been with my wife for over 12 years and there's little that she's seen in me as a person.  Even when I've recently struggled with bipolar swings, she is very supportive.  I am very fortunate in this regard.

Anyway, all the best to you!"

running,eojm4aq,t3_bs6z5w,1558639741.0,"Hi, improving VO2 Max and LT are two very different things, but both necessary to be a better runner.  Many marathon training plans work on both.  However, if you're a distance mountain runner (which I assume means off-road with lots of vertical), then I'd recommend Jason Koop's book ""Training Essentials for Ultrarunning"".  He explains how the training approach is NOT like marathon training and how to deal with the unique challenges of off-road running in often difficult terrain and conditions.

On the other hand, if you're interested in improving LT, then I'd recommend Hadd's article.  Here's the link...

[https://www.angio.net/personal/run/hadd.pdf](https://www.angio.net/personal/run/hadd.pdf)

I've had tremendous success with Hadd's approach with my PR's in both the Half-marathon and Marathon distances.  But it does fall way short in training for trail ultra races.  Good luck!"
CPTSD,eojkj9p,t1_eojh2wt,1558639124.0,"My therapist and I briefly touched upon this yesterday.  I definitely have feelings and emotions, and will show a tremendous amount of sympathy and empathy for others, especially if they've been through similar traumatic events as myself.  But crying maybe opening up a vulnerable side of myself that I don't like.  Being hurt in the past means I will take extra precautions to avoid being vulnerable again.  Kinda makes sense, but we have a lot more work to do to figure it out.  Think this theory might work for you?"

Personally, I think it's ok to question the diagnosis, but if you can, get more than one opinion.  A very good and experienced therapist would get more detailed information from you.  On the other hand, I find that you can probably tell the diagnosis just from what a psychiatrist prescribes.  And yes, I am bipolar.  Hope you find a clear answer!"

bipolar,eod78hy,t3_brevz4,1558469487.0,"First, while you don't think it's good news, but it's good news that you got help when you did and treatment.  Many have gone without knowing and treatment for many years and their lives were much worse off.  Please try not to fret over the labels (bipolar, ADHD, etc.) and think of them as symptoms that just need to be treated.

Yes, if you are bipolar, you can be without those closest knowing it.  I was diagnosed as bipolar in my 20's, and manged to ""manage"" it for many years, even without prescription medication.  My wife who's known me for over 12 years never knew I was bipolar until recent events woke up that monster in my head.  Now I'm seeking treatment and back on medication, because I know that's what's best for me and those whom I love very much.

Again, please don't get tripped up over what meds you are prescribed.  If they help, that's all that really matters in the end.  And if it really helps, I sometimes say I don't suffer from bipolar, but rather have Peter Pan Syndrome ;-).  All the best to you!"

I told myself that I cried a lifetime of tears so there were no more tears left inside me to come out.  That was over 35 years ago and I probably only shed tears three times since then.

The good news (I hope) is that my therapist says that I have shutdown my feelings, as an emotional safeguard.  I just need to undo that, so to speak to feel again.  This sounds very similar to what you're going through.  I hope you can work it out!"
