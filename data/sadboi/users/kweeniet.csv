Basically you measure  how long the wall/your tank is and cut a piece of string that length. Then you measure how long the strings that run down have to be + 10cm extra and cut all those. You use 2 strings per runner down so I just cut one long piece of string, fold it and tie it to the string that goes horizontally to the wall. The total number of runners needs to be able to be divided by 2. After that you're pretty much in charge of how you want to tie it! You can find super basic macrame patterns all over pinterest and it's easiest to first mount the horizontal string and tie from above :)"

EDAnonymous,fdk1p9g,t3_elr306,1578493870.0,"The thing is, even though there are general guidelines and measurements for fats/proteins/carbs etc, it really depends on a lot of other variables like; what your goals are, where you live, if you lead an active life, how fast your metobalism works, what sex your are, how old you are, how much money you have etc.

Diet culture is toxic and it's not as black and white. Hell, researchers just discovered that the 'real paleo cavemen' ate way more carbs than what the general consensus is atmo. It's also dependant on trend (like how avocado's suddenly where hot and happening etc) and on marketing (they used to promote sugar as healthy and because of the rise of sugar they made fat the bad guy so that people would stay away from that yet load up on refined sugars) 

At the end of the day, you control your flesh-mechsuit. You feel how your body reacts to certain foods and quantities. And trust your (empty) gut.

It's not luck you lardy glutton this takes a fuck ton of discipline and I'm slowly killing myself to have some sense of goddamn control in this trainwreck of a life. Fuck you for thinking I'm lucky to be this skinny or that skinny is even the end goal. And fuck you for thinking that this is luck. You want this? Don't stuff your face with crap and go workout instead of depending on luck. Egh. I'm done.
