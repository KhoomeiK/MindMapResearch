Right now I'm evaluating some javascript frameworks (Angular in particular) to improve the front end, but I've been down this road before with Angular 1x.  

Most of my applications are heavily webAPI dependent, but also similar behavior using MVC controllers and bypassing the whole razor / model binding business in favor of json and javascript.  I'm not a super big fan of blending server side code in with HTML, although I understand the power of HTML helpers, partials, and other ""partial types"" as editors.  

With that in mind, do you think Blazor would serve as a decent replacement for custom SignalR functionality, coupled with solving the huge mound of client side javascript I so desperately want to wrangle and organize?  Does it have all of the snappy client side capabilities of animating and manipulating the DOM?  Am I going to be heavily dependent on writing razor code in HTML, and constrained to what Blazor can and can't do, or does it work well with other javascript?  

The reading I've done has sparked lots of interest, but the stack I'm using is based on technologies that aren't frameworks or subject to deprecation as many things MS have been in the past.  Do you believe this will continue to evolve without introducing breaking changes as it progresses, or do you think sticking with the underlying technologies that Blazor combines into a single solution is the way to move forward?  I can't be the only one that has regrets leveraging frameworks with limitations, or a short term lifespan.  

Thanks in advance.."

A deep understanding of the DOM and javascript will get you much further than avoidance, including adapting to the various client side frameworks like Angular or React, or writing your own."

I agree that caloric intake is probably 95% of it, but many of the carbohydrates that exist today are complex/not easily digestible, and don't exist among other species other than us humans.  Fats, proteins, fibers, and naturally occurring carbohydrates are good.  You CAN lose weight just eating ice cream at a caloric deficit.  There are better ways to take advantage of the metabolism, and support one's health.  Our bodies store fat reserves as fuel, and being more fat adapted as a fuel source seems reasonable, over loading up on worthless carbohydrates and sugars as fuel.  Recent evidence has shown that ""low fat"" anything generally means substitutions that aren't healthy, and there really isn't any reason to exclude them (other than processed / trans fats).

I'm not a dietitian, but my experience with this type of eating is roughly 4 years and counting.  I'm fairly sedentary, but my weight is healthy and maintainable."

I'll admit that I'm getting info from Reddit and other news aggregates such as r/bernieblindness that give detailed accounts of broadcast media presenting misleading infographics and mental gymnastics to avoid saying Sanders was in the lead.  I also saw lots of video clips of said ""talking heads"", and paired that with my firsthand experience in 2016 with media.  In conversations with people here, they literally admit that they're going to vote for who will win, which from what I understand, would always be the corporate funded pick that is being peddled by corporate broadcasts, and endorsed by all career politicians.  

I don't understand how healthcare reform, and other embarrassing domestic (or foreign) policy changes aren't resonating with most voters. I don't understand why else anyone would want more of the same from the past 20 years.  Joe Biden is currently going through the wringer with sexual accusations, has a history of plagiarism with his speaches, and has been on the wrong side of history on several pieces of legislation.  He's not funded in an ideal way, and he's showing signs of mental decline.

I'm for any candidate funding their election through citizens, rather than candidates in debt to corporations.  Clean candidates don't get fair treatment from media.  See Chris Matthews idiotic rants, or the View's interview of Bernie or Tulsi Gabbard for easily identifiable examples of this.  Talk segments on corporate broadcasts even admitted to ""having to defeat Bernie"" and stating they would rather hand it to Trump than have a Sanders presidency.  It's not a conspiracy when the majority of media is run by just 6 corporations that have a vested interest in protecting their wealth, and keeping things the way they are.  A Biden, or Trump presidency will do.

Bernie absolutely could have done more to beat Biden, but I'm not entirely convinced that the deck was stacked for him to win in any scenario.  

In any case, voting for yet another career politician with corporate debt is throwing away your vote more than voting 3rd party would be.

I'm basically saying that while whatever that report proves, or doesn't prove is important, it isn't nearly as important as the root problems in government. Presidents have term limits, and Trump will eventually be gone, but our problems are going to persist, as they have all along.  I don't like Trump, but our focus should be elsewhere.
