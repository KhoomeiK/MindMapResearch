As someone else said, photographers take tons of pics before getting the right one, so don't feel bad if you have to take a bunch before you get your perfect shot. You are beautiful in each one of those photos.üíú"

Some of the other foods I'm allergic to, like corn, I cannot eat all. But milk, I seem to be ok with... my stomach is a little upset if I have a lot of dairy, but that's it."

Allergies,f4bgxlm,t3_dk82d0,1571512344.0,"I went through something similar, except I didn't have chronic hives. I have a anxiety, so my last doctor would not take me seriously, telling me my hives and reactions were just anxiety. I finally got him to refer me to the allergist in the clinic. He did and the allergist did a very short prick test and said I had no allergies. I knew that I did and started keeping a food diary of everything I ate with every ingredient. I brought it back in and they didn't take me seriously, still saying it was anxiety. One day, I had a bad reaction to a filler in a medication (corn is one of my allergies and the filler was cornstarch) my throat swelled and I was developing hives inside my throat. I called 911 and was seen. I went back to my doctor and he STILL said it was anxiety. And the allergist was not taking me seriously either, telling me corn is a rare allergy. At that point I was done and got a new doctor and a new allergist. I got my allergy testing redone at the new allergist and the tests revealed several food allergies, ones I didnt even know I had. My situation is different, but I do know how it feels to be not taken seriously by a doctor. My suggestion would be to find a new allergist, one who will look at your food diary, give you allergy tests and believe you. Good luck!"

Allergies,f256zmc,t1_f23t210,1569967387.0,"@bminus83 I went through that with my previous doctor. I have anxiety and he kept blaming my allergies on my anxiety. I started to feel like I was losing my mind because I KNEW it wasn't anxiety I was experiencing. One day, I had a reaction that caused my throat to start to swell with visible hives in it. I switched doctors immediately after that. I highly recommend that you switch your doctor. If you don't, then make sure to tell him to write in your medical notes that he is refusing to send out a referral to an allergist after you telling him you concerns of allergies. Good luck!"
CamGirlProblems,f083l62,t3_d45hmf,1568474487.0,"One thing I've seen people do is make kind of a game out of it if there is someone near them. They tell their followers that there is someone else around and they have to try to be quiet. A lot of the followers think it's really sexy to have to try to sneak and be quiet. Maybe that's an option, or something you could try sometimes?"
CamGirlProblems,exfrifl,t3_cshvab,1566246809.0,"I made the mistake of choosing one of the first people who asked me to mod the first day I started. I didn't know any better. So I let him. It was ok for awhile, but then he started becoming possessive, and banning members for the smallest things. He would expect me to talk to him on PM during my shows. He also started emailing me constantly. It started to get a little disturbing. I belong to ACF for support and he made a fake account there. I realized almost immediately that it was him. He wanted complete  access to me. My advice to you is either don't have one, have someone you know and trust, or if you do choose a fan.. don't choose them right away. Good luck! üíú"

Edit: I'm not saying to try to continue to eat them. If you think you are allergic to them, do not eat them."

Also, don't be too hard on yourself for things you've done in your past or on days you're feeling insecure about yourself. Sit with your feelings and acknowledge them but don't let them stay.. be kind to yourself like you would be to a friend.
