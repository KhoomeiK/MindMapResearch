findapath,fowqvcx,t1_fou22tx,1588125229.0,"Hi, not OP but I have a question about time balance as a teacher. How do you make time for things like lesson planning, grading, preparing materials (for crafting or demos for example)? I love teaching but I've learned that overwork tanks my health too."
careerguidance,fowpfbm,t3_g7fj1i,1588124406.0,"I'm going to address your concerns in order:

You are correct. Unfortunately, PhD is not considered work experience despite the fact that you worked more than full-time for several years. Instead, you would have to emphasize that you can work with others, are capable of showing up on time, and are aware of corporate workplace etiquette. 

Additionally, there is the strange notion in the US that PhD's should be paid more because they spent more money and time on their education. Not that I am saying you do not deserve money proportionate to your experience! But this means employers will balk at hiring or even interviewing you because they believe you will expect more compensation than other applicants with a similar skillset. If you have a PhD and no other full-time/corporate work experience, then they believe you will ditch the job as soon as you find a better paying position (now that you finally have some ""real"" experience). I am sorry. It sucks.

I know you do not want to take a postdoc position, but in the US, postdoc positions are considered full-time work experience that you can put towards breaking into industry jobs later. I would consider applying to postdoc positions for that reason (also because postdoc positions are usually listed with a formal job title such as Research Assistant that sounds more like staff than an academic). Since you would be on contract, you wouldn't even need to explain that you left academia for money.

Disclaimer that I myself do not have experience applying with an undergraduate masters degree but if I were you I would just fill out your forms as if you had both a BS and an MS. 

For GPA - do you generally know what scores you received on exams and assignments? If so, ""calculate"" (estimate) your GPA based on what courses are typically undergraduate courses and what courses were graduate-majority. It doesn't have to be exactly correct. I certainly do not remember my GPA exactly. You can explain it during the interview or around the time they run a background check, and cite some exam scores as evidence. 

If any of the places you're applying to will accept a CV instead of a resume, make one really long CV and go into detail about the types of data analytics/projects you've worked on (if you have not already). That should capture most ""key words"" AND go into details about what you're capable of on the job. For industry jobs, reorganize your CV sections so that your data analytics work takes up a good chunk of your first page. I prefer to do this on my one-page resumes by labeling this section as ""Research Experience"" (in your case ""Analytics/Programming/etc. Experience"" might be better?) and bumping everything else (including even education maybe) down. 

You aren't paranoid. The stress of having a foreign-looking name is real. But you probably wouldn't want to work for places like that anyway. The language you use on your resume/CV (hopefully factual, concise, and grammatically correct with region-accurate jargon) should speak for itself with any decent employer."
findapath,fowd4jz,t3_g9ll8g,1588117469.0,"For people like you (imo for most people), your focus should be less about the subject matter/field and more about getting to know your personality in more detail. Somewhere along the way you pick up enough knowledge that your expertise/experience combined with your personality will narrow down positions well suited for you. 

&#x200B;

Some questions for you to ask yourself:

1. When do you like working with people and when do you not like it? Is it about different types of people, different situations/dynamics, or is it about feeling helpful or about feeling drained? 
2. Of the interests listed, it sounds like you enjoy regarding (observing/learning about) these things more than actively participating in them. Each of these fields have many different jobs, some more direct and some more supporting roles, that are very different and utilize very different skills. When you think of each of these fields/interests, what roles do you see yourself willing to do in exchange for a living wage?   
You do not have to be excited to do it for the rest of your life. You're just asking yourself what you would be willing to do. People change roles and people change fields and both are okay but they do so after they've started somewhere else. When you're 21, all you need is a starting point.
3. Not a question but a task - learn about what specific job tasks there are in the world so you can learn about what tasks employers are willing to pay for (and how much). Find out if certain job duties are very high/low in demand and for how much. For example, plenty of employers are willing to hire for remote data entry and transcription and plenty of people would love to do either of these things all day in exchange for a living wage, but no one wants to do these things because they're passionate about typing repetitively/accurately/precisely... and also, employers are offering mere pennies. Sad trombone. 
4. Which of the typical job tasks (filling out forms, sending things to people for approval, walking/driving from place to place asking strangers questions, convincing people to buy things they may or may not need, lifting things, being very precise with your eyes and/or hands, helping people get along when they disagree, fixing people's mistakes, finding people's mistakes, helping companies save money, looking things up when no one else can find answers, typing/reading/talking/listening for long periods of time, doing the same physical actions over and over again and not having to use your brain too much, etc.) that are hiring at a reasonable frequency and for a rate you are willing to accept, are you willing to do? Which of these are in a field you find palatable? 

&#x200B;

TL;DR Figure out what you are willing to do in exchange for the amount of money you want to makes. Figure out what you are absolutely not willing to do for any price. Figure out what tasks you would be willing to do for a certain price and how often. Figure out fields that have lots of openings with more of the first, and none of the second, and very little of the third (or at least for a very good price)."

careerguidance,flgiqlz,t3_food8p,1585143579.0,"If your boss was willing to have someone else learn the language why not send the coworker in question to further training or pay for him to take actual courses?

If your position and this coworker’s position are equal/identical, I don’t see why this is a problem for you to solve unless someone was making it your problem (i.e., asking you to  mentor your coworker, giving you heat for projects not being completed on time). 

It sounds like too much of your time is allocated towards helping him. Make sure someone knows that. 

Your boss should be keeping track of how much each person is doing, if things are getting done in a timely manner, etc. You’ve said she manages three teams so that’s fine but once the situation has been made clear to her, it is her job to handle it. 

It is also your coworker’s job to ask your boss for help as soon as he realized he was in over his head. Keeping this under wraps for too long will go very poorly for him. But it’s also not your responsibility to help him come clean. 

You doing 90% of the work PLUS handholding your coworker through entire projects seems like it is going to create even more resentment than it already has. 

While I don’t recommend holding back on productivity out of spite, I do recommend drawing some mental boundaries to get some emotional distance from the situation. 

You can justify being less efficient and being less hands on with your coworker by acknowledging you are slowing down (aka making more time for a healthy mindset while at work) due to burnout. 

If you enjoy teaching/mentoring, by all means, you can continue handholding your coworker but 1) it doesn’t seem like it’s been working and 2) make sure it is added to your job tasks and responsibilities, maybe even properly compensated though that does not seem likely.

Edit: hit “send” too early"
findapath,flgc7m1,t3_fomhy0,1585138603.0,"Do you have access to therapy or a life coach? I would consider that. This is not something some internet comments can solve for you. I think you could benefit from a trained professional (who you click with) who can act as a regular sounding board.

It sounds like the things you’ve tried don’t work out because you only half-ass them AND you keep expecting to find some magical “key” to feeling motivated in life. 

There is no “key”, no immediate magic moment. People try things throughout life and learn about themselves from how they react and what they really like or really dislike.

Release yourself of the expectation to immediately “find meaning” in everything you try. Keep reminding yourself to let go of this expectation.

Then try things. Really commit fully to them, for at least 3 weeks continuously. Even if you’re terrible. Even if you don’t “find meaning” in it. At least you will have discovered you hate something. 

Start with something that you can’t justify as being your “key” to loving life. Start with something you can’t justify as helping you be more attractive or employable or a better entrepreneur. 

None of that matters right now. You have everything you need for those. But you do lack the right attitude for two of those. It almost sounds like you lack any attitude. 

As for your “dream” of starting your own business... that is very vague and not necessarily realistic at the rate you’re going.

I am not discouraging you from your dream per se, but do ask yourself your reasons for wanting that dream. 

Why do you want to start your own business? Is it to have flexible working hours? Do you want an automated stream of income eventually? Do you want to feel satisfaction from making something on your own?

Why do you feel so strongly about making a product or service that will help people? What about this part of your “dream” could not be fulfilled by volunteering? Is it because you want to be known for helping others? 

What is it about earning money from helping others that particularly motivates you when from your post it sounds like not much else motivates you?

Figure out those reasons. In the meantime, maybe separate the drive for profit from the drive to be of use to others. 

Since you are looking for work again and have decided against traveling, I assume you ran out of money for your year of traveling or that you feel discouraged by it. 

(If you do still have the money for it... seriously, go travel. It is a perfect way to step out of your comfort zone and be REALLY bad at all sorts of things. Go be bad at starting conversations with strangers. Go lose a expensive watch or your phone or something. Maybe you’ll lose your luggage in a country where you don’t speak the language! Though this is not as scary in 2020 when most young people speak English and cell service is global. It sounds like you had some sort of expectation for “traveling the world” and didn’t really understand that your expectations might not be met, especially not immediately. It also sounds like you didn’t plan for your yearlong trip at all. Figure out what those expectations were. Figure out why at 34, the thought of traveling alone scared you out of doing something you chose to do purely on your own. But if you have the means to, just go anyway! And if you don’t, then take some weekend trips here and there when you get your next job. Do more scary things. Commit to being bad at them, which is different from half-assing them, or showing up without participating. You have had enough experience with that. You are employable and can stick to healthy habits if you want to. You are very capable.)

So maybe get a job and use that for the profit part of your dream while you spend your free time trying to find another way to develop something people will need. 

But also... find out what YOU need. Even if you magically made a product or service that will transform the lives of everyone with disposeable income, and you found a way to make the business sustainable in the long term, would you be happy with your life?"

Sometimes there’s two updates - one through your OS’s app store and another after that through the app (it will ask you if you consent to downloading an update that requires MB of storage and it will recommend you use wi-fi). 

Most of the time, it’s only the second kind of update so you won’t need to use the app store. 

There was a big update recently though, so maybe you 1) have updated through the app store AND 2) downloaded whatever packet of files that the game prompts you to when you open it again.

This is tricky because you don’t want to lie. It is unlikely you’ve taken Analytical/Physical/Inorganic Chemistry, right?

Other than that, focus on Biochemistry and Organic Chemistry techniques (NMR/IR maybe?), maybe add it under relevant courses just so the word chemistry appears early on in your resume. If you did any presentations or projects in Organic, include those.

Then you can use bullet points that are more descriptive, like “file sharing” or “remote collaboration” or “video conferencing” amd then name Hangouts and Docs as examples. 

Basically, adjust so that you can best mirror the language that the job posting is asking for.

resumes,fkiv1bf,t3_finlb6,1584229308.0,"TLDR: You have a lot of content but some of it is needlessly repetitive. Some of your bullet points are not specific/descriptive/objective enough.

Summary: If you feel like you absolutely have to include a summary, then first of all, don't use the word ""Bio"" as an adjective. Secondly, make the summary more descriptive and take out the core qualifications. Example: ""Recent graduate with x years of experience in microbiology and molecular techniques seeks y position."" Depending on the position, adjust the ""y"" for relevance.

Core qualifications & experience sections: These should be combined and listed as a skills section(s) instead. I would have a large section for lab skills and a smaller one for spoken languages/software/equipment.

Lab experience: Some of the bullet points you have are quite descriptive. What is the context for you gaining those experiences? Coursework experiments? Research? Internships? Independent study? Did you have a final project for your last year of undergraduate? Depending on your answers, you could make a separate ""Laboratory Experience"" or ""Research Experience"" section. If you only have basic coursework and maybe a final senior year project, then I would move these to education under relevant courses and maybe make a list of some relevant projects or experiments you conducted.

ALSO: ""C.Elegans"" would get your resume thrown out ASAP. 1) Italicize. 2) Put a space after the period. 3) The first ""e"" in ""*elegans*"" is lower case. This applies to any organismal species. ""*S. aureus*"" or ""*Staphylococcus aureus*"" for example.

Work experience: I would list these under their own heading of ""Other work experience"".

For your construction position, I would replace your first two bullet points with actual job duties. Example: How did you develop great communication skills? Did you interact with customers daily? If so, why? What tasks were you assigned that made you have to interact with customers? You want to be descriptive with objective facts so that the reader can reach the conclusion, on their own, that you have great communication skills.

For your assistant instructor position, how did you help (I would replace with ""assisted"" even if it is repetitive) schedule and structure classes? Did you provide feedback on lesson plans? Did you handle the main teacher's calendar appointments? Be specific.

The one I found most recently was on flexjobs.com, which I recommend using as a starting point. It is a paid membership site in order to apply for job listings and to see the employer name but sometimes you will have luck googling the job description (which is what I did). 

Also, I cannot vouch for any of the services as an employee. One I have personally used to receive tutoring is called Smarthinking, but the wait times for a reply were so long that I wonder if tutors are juggling multiple chats and if management is putting some kind of unholy pressure on tutors to meet completion numbers."
careerguidance,fje4o7d,t3_fcx6o8,1583265173.0,"I hate to say this, but I have to say that I agree with a lot of comments here about OP’s attitude.

HOWEVER. 

OP, if you see this, I don’t think this reflects on your moral character as a person. Like someone else said, though, you do still need to own that these issues are yours and that you are enabling them taking over your life and future by not wanting to change. 

It is one thing to have major lifelong restrictions for multiple reasons (physical, mental), but it is another to carry this with you throughout your life. Even if you find a job that fits your restrictions and makes you a living wage, the chances of someone wanting to hire AND keep you around on their payroll with this current mindset of yours is very slim. 

Your refusal to try qualifying for government benefits is concerning. Your refusal to admit you are part of the problem is concerning. Your refusal to admit that you need to change in order to get to where you say you want to be is concerning. Your refusal to entertain the idea of trying further treatments is concerning. 

There are many kinds of stimulants, mood stabilizers, talk therapy, and exposure therapy. Just because antidepressants and antipsychotics and some therapy didn’t work does not mean you are completely treatment-resistant. 

Even people who are physically resistant to medical interventions benefit from multiple modes of therapy combined with lifestyle changes, so even if other medications end up being equally ineffective, you still have other proven forms of treatment. But you have to be willing to use them and be willing to admit that they are better than how you are living now. 

Having a roof over your head that is paid for and having parents who, in their own way, wish for your improved health and your future ability to be self-sustained puts you at a prime place to succeed in utilizing professional help at your own pace. You have the stable foundation that is lacking in the lives that are not successfully help by intervention programs or therapies. Use it. 

I think you are close to admitting that you don’t actually want to move forward in life, though. If you find that is true, that is okay! Admitting that would be a great first step and something worth tackling. But I hope, OP, you eventually make it a goal to tackle the rest too. 

OP, if you qualify for Medicaid or its equivalent where you are, please do so. Please see mental health professionals to get formal diagnoses that you can use to register with the office of students with disabilities at your graduate program. 

This is not the same as collecting disability from the government. It usually means having accommodations and access to additional specialized tutoring, counseling, etc. Registering with your school can help you obtain rehabilitation/career placement/counseling services for a very specific population of struggling and underemployed adults after graduation. 

Please learn to reach out for help ASAP, even if you can only manage email for now. Do not be afraid to follow up multiple times.

SkincareAddiction,fjavryh,t1_fj9079t,1583181545.0,"The key to understanding the difference in when specific cleansers get recommended is also in understanding what gets washed away, not just what happens when you rub a substance on your face. 

The purpose of commercial cleansers, oil or water based, is that they are supposed to be miscible with what is on your face AND miscible with the water you use to rinse. These properties are different. 

Water-based cleansers wash away more water than oil-based cleansers do. That’s because, generally speaking, water in the cleanser is more miscible with water in skin cells than with sebum. You don’t want to strip dry skin of even more water, right? So it is (generally) less drying to use an oil cleanser on dry skin, than a water-based cleanser.

Oil-based cleansers can dissolve oils, yes. The idea is that they dissolve the oils on your face, and then that mixture on your face mixes with the rinsing water to get washed away, but without drawing water out of your skin cells. This should theoretically leave about the same amount of water in your skin. 

But again, miscibility isn’t an either/or, and every cleanser is different. Just because something can dissolve oil doesn’t mean that cleanser-sebum mix will get washed away easily with water. 

Take pure coconut oil (without any emulsifier) for example. There are people who use coconut oil as a makeup remover because coconut oil dissolves organic compounds like a boss. But water doesn’t rinse off makeup dissolved in coconut oil. You need some mechanical force like wiping with a towel. And even then where will still be some coconut oil left on the skin, which some people like. 

Basically: Plain coconut oil has a very different miscibility with water than a commercial oil cleanser. A person with dry skin would respond quite differently to coconut oil vs. an oil cleanser.

So as I said before, it’s not an absolute. Another example I used in a different comment: A stripping oil cleanser like the DHC one would be pretty devastating for dry skin. Not all oil cleansers are equal, just like how not all water based cleansers are equal. 

Also, not all skin is the same. Maybe someone has dry skin with a lot of clogged pores, while another person has very oily sweaty skin but never any pimples, while another person has oily skin with many blackheads. Maybe what dissolves one person’s comedones ends up giving someone else blackheads for the first time. They’re all going to find different things work for them and oftentimes it won’t be based on specific rules. 

The science (in this case) just exists to explain how things work and to help guide people towards understanding why something does or doesn’t work."

EatCheapAndHealthy,fj3zyx5,t1_fj3h6bu,1582997097.0,"u/just_a_samdollar, I hope comments like this don’t put you off! I genuinely think herbal Cantonese soups may be of interest to you as a Native American. 

Though, if anyone is hesitant, I would suggest starting with one of the more obviously ”fusion” recipes, Hong Kong-style borscht. 

It’s just some kind of beef stew meat (oxtail is great but get whatever is cheapest tbh), tomatoes, carrots, celery, cabbage. My family usually leaves out the cabbage and sometimes adds potatoes. It’s simple but the flavors are definitely more of a crowd-pleaser than herbal/medicinal soups!"
EatCheapAndHealthy,fj3249d,t1_fj302fe,1582963482.0,"*dried coconut meat specifically! Not coconut flakes either. I think it’s a regional thing because most of China is so far from SE Asia that coconuts don’t feature prominently in food outside of SE China. 

For OP:

There are a lot of other herbs and seeds and nuts and fruit (examples: pearl barley, goji berries, jujubes, dried figs, dried shiitake mushrooms, dried lily bulbs, ginseng/“female” ginseng/burdock root, dried mountain yam, peanuts, adzuki beans, black eyed peas, fresh lotus root, fresh carrot, fresh apples/pears, fresh gourds/squashes, and many, many more.) that can go in Chinese broths. Less traditionally, my family also uses chayote and jicama. 

There are many different combinations based on traditional Chinese medicine. (For example, chicken feet or black-skinned chicken can be added to bone-in pork for different applications.) Personally I just go for taste. I am not the biggest fan of the dried coconut, for example.

The flavor can range in the bitterness department, so ymmv. I wouldn’t say it’s a definite crowd pleaser, especially for people who prefer lots of seasoning. Would definitely be interested in what OP thinks! 

Also, some of these ingredients aren’t exactly cheap, especially if you’re looking for a combination that captures the traditional herby flavor. There are pre-packaged dried mixes available online now if you don’t want to invest in bulk."

findapath,fho5gl5,t3_f40v84,1581742101.0,"At my community college, if you failed a class or withdrew too late, your grade was a 0.0/4.0. If you retook the same course code, the new grade would replace the 0.0 when calculating your GPA. The old 0.0’s would still show up on your transcript, but your GPA would essentially be unaffected. And that upwards progression looks damn good. 

However, first check with Academic Affairs or Advising to see if old grades stop showing up after a certain number of years. I doubt it since your student ID number will still be the same if you go back to the same school, but it’s worth a shot if you can save some money and still protect your new GPA. 

Another option is to go to a new community college. You can take a placement test for the standard reading and math courses and skip the ones you likely failed at your old community college, without those old F’s affecting your GPA. Plus, you would save money by not having to take alegbra or pre-calc when you’re already at the calculus level.

Edited to add: in case it’s not clear, with your background and current level of education, you should NOT have to take high school classes at community college to gain entrance to any undergraduate institution. In your shoes, I would re-apply to community college unless they banned you from campus or something like that (unlikely unless you were dangerous...? In which case find another one). The whole point of community college is that they’ll take anyone! 

If you opt out of retaking old courses to boost your GPA, make sure to take your placement tests or take the SAT/ACT/whatever equivalent is in your country (my cc accepted SAT scores in place of placement tests for reading and math). 

Starting at a community college and getting good grades consistently from now on shows you can handle managing your own time and a full courseload in an academic environment, which can be your springboard into a four year academic program of your choice."
