That definitely gives me confidence. Also the awareness I'm living healthier since I also started in a time where I didn't do other sports/activities, that also helps with confidence. It didn't affect my social confidence much but I don't really have struggles there, sorry :/ 
Oh yeah, discipline - definitely. If you see you're able to maintain a running routine (btw, it doesn't have to be every day, I mostly go 2-3 times a week and honestly not much in the winter as unfortunately the weather was really bad here and I don't like gyms) it really gives you the confidence to try other self-improvement routines. Also I feel it just removes mental blockages for me, like I'm overthinking something again, but if I'm back from a run I just feel a lot more like acting, doing something instead of just sitting there. I can't really explain that lol that's just my personal experience but I'm sure there are studies about the effects of running on the brain and mental health if you're interested :)

I'm happy to hear you started running. The beginning may be hard and there are definitely runs where you just ask yourself why am I doing this, why am I torturing me like that but that will pass! And the feeling afterwards is the best. Best wishes and have fun!"

I think in general the song is about paranoia (*I think I might be scared of the world and the way it makes me feel afraid*) but I somehow also think it's related to drugs. As in *I want what's best for me and I think I know just what that means*

I know it may sound a bit far off but well Ryan liked drugs. While I don't quite get what the burning rose and the brimstone stand for, I kind of think (but that's really just my intuition, as well with the drug thing, I could be completely wrong!) he (lyrical I) took a lot of something which made him lose his mind, and then somehow a vision or a fantasy or a dream came true with the roses set on fire, and now 

*I, well I found what's best for me and now I see no tragedy and I, well I found a burning rose and now I won't be packing little pistols no more*

so somehow his paranoia is healed which also fits to Ryan singing this quite calmly in the end.

Potheads usually don't end up on the street or do fucked up things to get their weed, like it may be the case with other drugs, but even with other drugs there are always a lot of high functioning addicts who can maintain a life besides their usage. 

It's not about how measurably fucked up you are, it's about whether you live the life you really want to live. And that can be impaired by any bad habit and it's not personal failure, it's very very human. Good read OP, don't feel like a pothead loser now, you are a winner for you reflected honestly and (maybe?) made a decision for how you want to continue your life and that's a sign of personal autonomy and strength.

It also helps me massively with regards to self-esteem because when I smoked weed practically daily for some time I began to hate myself for several reasons, mostly because I hung out with friends who were sober and I thought I massively annoyed them, and because my productivity really suffered from it. I couldn't do enough for uni, I had no motivation to concentrate and rarely felt even able to concentrate at all. Now I have smoked only once in 46 days, am amazed how awake I feel all the time, feel more connected to friends and the stuff I enjoy doing and am so much more confident because I can do the stuff I want to do and not always lack behind. I know there are people who can smoke daily and be very productive etc and of course you don't have to be productive in the first place (plus there are very different ways to be productive, work/studying is just one) but it's more about being able to do the stuff you want to do, and I for example actually like my studies and am motivated to learn well for uni so my smoking just didn't fit with what I wanted to accomplish :)"

Drugs,fg9opux,t3_exgnd7,1580641432.0,"Impressive how you managed to lower your doses because you knew you'd have to give your body some taste of the drug at least. I'm quitting weed right now (18 days off) and I sometimes do similar things like smoking CBD or something, just to have that craved taste and also just to have me go outside on my balcony sometimes, enjoying the fresh air and enjoying a break from everything inside. I really appreciate that but I'm glad I don't have to smoke substitute joints often and I now also do it only in the evenings, when I have done some work and I want to treat myself. No comparison to vaping THC at uni and in the city, that was not a nice evening ritual but wanting to always alter my state of mind.  

Anyway, I think you have quit in a very intelligent way and I'm very glad you feel better than before and I wish you all the best!"

When the gas gets out the dispenser and the part of the balloon close to it freeze (bc of physics but don't ask me), it gets really cold so you might want to be careful with your hands also but it's generally fine if you are a bit careful. Have fun!"
