abuse,fqntx90,t1_fqk9d0e,1589501331.0,"I understand. You could try writing a letter apologizing and explaining and then maybe reading it to him. Something to be a sort of buffer in that conversation. Just some short and simple as a start letting him know that you are sorry and that you do love him, care about him and, as you said, would never ever hurt him.

Does his mom know about this situation at all?"
abuse,fqjguff,t1_fqis54r,1589409752.0,"Yeah that makes sense. Do you usually apologize once you’ve calmed down? Removing yourself from the situation could help you to calm down as well, just going to the next room and waiting for the annoyance to taper down and then going back to apologize.

I know it’s probably a little hard to communicate much with your nephew since he is five and likely won’t remember much but explaining to him why he shouldn’t do certain things, such as grabbing the mouse and “smashing” it against the desk, could be helpful as long as it’s done in a calm and reasonable manner.

It’s an authoritative parenting style which could help both you and him. Not authoritarian or passive. He could build his morals and know right from wrong growing up and you could in a way practice that parenting style for when you have kids of your own (if you want to that is). 

Again, this is going to take time and is going to be difficult but you’re wanting to put effort into healing so that’s amazing as is."
abuse,fqgfjo2,t3_ginpai,1589344977.0,"It is possible that you repressed the traumatic experience or it could have happened before you can remember. Repression of traumatic childhood experiences isn’t common but it has happened in some cases. I’m sorry that you have to feel the way that you do, I really hope you can get closure.
If you are comfortable and willing, maybe try talking about this with a therapist. There’s online therapy you could look into or some group therapy, whichever will suit you best."
abuse,fqgem40,t3_gh94tu,1589344306.0,If she has brain damage then she probably needs some medical attention. You should contact local authorities or consult online therapists for help on making a plan. What exactly is your situation? Is it possible for you to go into more detail?
selfharm,fqgcxea,t3_gim517,1589343132.0,"You're not an attention seeking whore. It's so amazing that you have been refraining from self-harm. I've been clean for a few months now and I understand that it really is such a struggle sometimes. You're strong. You've got this.

Don't feel guilty about not telling him. It is a very personal part of yourself and it is difficult to open up about. Don't force yourself to tell him if you really are not comfortable. It's okay. This is a tough fight to go through. You'll be okay. Take it easy on yourself, you're doing incredibly."
abuse,fqgb53m,t1_fqf75uf,1589341954.0,"Okay that's a good start to gathering evidence. It's great that you have hobbies that help you feel better while still in your situation. Maybe try finding an activity or something that you can do with your siblings to just give you three something more to connect on.

I will absolutely do my best to help and support but if you need to consult qualified professionals there is online and anonymous therapy that you could try. They might be able to help you find ways to get through and out of this situation.

You are not alone in this! Hopefully things will be resolved for you and your siblings. We're here for you."
abuse,fqgaerf,t1_fqfuojc,1589341481.0,That's completely understandable. Do you usually deescalate pretty quickly or is the anger long-lasting?
abuse,fqga6pm,t1_fqfda5w,1589341337.0,Absolutely! I can relate to the whole lack of identity and having a hard time between rationality and struggling. Finding a therapist you can connect with is difficult so yeah maybe group therapy would be helpful. If it doesn't work out at first don't be discouraged just keep doing your best. You're not alone.
abuse,fqftytn,t3_ghoqs9,1589331642.0,This is so incredible. I’m so happy that you are finally free from that chain of abuse. Focus on your mental health and work on becoming the best version of yourself. You’re so strong having made it through all that. I too have been abused throughout my life and I’m still working on finding myself. You are strong and keep moving forward!
abuse,fqftf8j,t3_ghqf0n,1589331341.0,"Just because you come from a line of men who end up being abusive doesn’t mean you have to continue that. Their actions do not define your character.

I understand that your concerns are heightened by what’s happened between you and your nephew but you are capable of empathy. My dad was a quick-tempered and very angry man and he was able to get better. He still spanked and yelled and threatened us sometimes but he was able to realize his mistakes. He was working on becoming more patient.

What I’m trying to say is that you aren’t a lost cause at all. You’re not broken, you just need a little bit of shining up. I’d say when you realize that you are starting to feel angry or frustrated just close your eyes and focus on your breathing. Count to five and back down to one until your breathing and heart rate are steady. I know it sounds dumb but it is a technique to calm down. There’s a lot of guided meditations that you could try as well as therapy. For the therapy, you could try online and anonymous or group therapy (whichever suits you best). You’re not alone in this and you’re strong enough to make a change."

If you feel like you are strong enough to stop yourself from going back to her for a relationship then you can try but I feel like the best route here might just be to block her and work on yourself and focus on moving on. I know you don’t want to hurt her but right now you should do what you can to take care of yourself. Even though I’m just a stranger, I care and I just don’t want you to get hurt again. You seem to be a really nice and caring person but sometimes extending yourself to the wrong people at the wrong times can be super harmful. Just please be careful and think your decisions through. Maybe make a pros and cons list if you think that could help. Or find different hobbies to put that energy into. We’re here for you <3"
abuse,fqfcuuu,t3_ghzail,1589322641.0,"Therapy could be extremely helpful. Admitting your actions is a huge step towards moving forward and this will be a difficult process but hopefully if you stay honest with yourself and your siblings, you will be able to find some closure.

It’s not uncommon that abused individuals become abusers but with your admission and regret, it shows that you are capable of empathy. Support groups and therapy would be helpful and there’s online and anonymous therapy if that would suit you better."

Overcoming what you had to is not easy but it’s incredible that you did and that you ended up where you did. Do you have any advice for how to stay motivated after experiencing abuse? I’ve been doing okay with my experiences but I’m still affected by it on my bad days.
abuse,fqfah11,t3_gic05c,1589321457.0,"If she is dangerous procede with immense caution. Abusive individuals can be capable of a lot and it is scary. I had a similar experience with my ex and if you find it difficult to stay away and you really just want nothing to do with her anymore, then yes you should block her. Please take care of yourself, you’re strong for getting out of that relationship."
abuse,fqf7q8n,t3_gi8o9p,1589320116.0,"Trauma bonds generally stem from abusive or traumatic childhood experiences and can lead to the individual having attachment issues in their own relationships as they grow.

She could benefit from therapy and healing from a relationship like this may take months or years depending on the person. Her saying that everything is fine could be due to her exhaustion instead of flat out denial. This is a very difficult situation and unfortunately the only way she can admit that it’s unhealthy for her is if she makes that choice herself. I was in an abusive relationship as well and it took me a long time to realize it.

My best advice would be to stay by her side and let her know the truth and show her that you are really there for her. Don’t push her just be honest. Maybe suggest therapy to help with her emotional well-being instead of for her abusive relationship if she’s comfortable. There’s online and anonymous therapy if that’s more suitable for her.

It’s hard for me to say because I don’t know her position on this but she could benefit from simply being sent this: [10 Signs of an Unhealthy Relationship](https://www.joinonelove.org/signs-unhealthy-relationship/)

abuse,fqf5p7j,t3_gi83bc,1589319144.0,"Narcissists naturally have a grandiose perception of themselves and feel they are above others. His actions are abusive and remind me of how I’ve been treated in a relationship before. Narcissists will find ways to justify their actions and because of this, they are unlikely to admit to their faults. I’m so sorry you have to go through this."

Also just a tip, I’m not sure if this will help or not but if you have any tangible proof (whether it’s a recording or something else) it might help your case as long as it is authentic and clear evidence of the conditions of your home life. Also with the restraining order already on record it could impact your argument of why you need professional intervention.

Even if they deny your claims, having your efforts in the right place and filing a police report can be useful. I’m not an expert or anything but hopefully I can be of help. Handle this delicately and gracefully as you are. I wish the best for you and your siblings. Keep us posted on your progress if you can."
abuse,fqezz54,t3_gigyc5,1589316414.0,"Nothing that happened is your fault.

I was a parentified child and seeing you write about feeling like you should’ve been able to do more even though you were just a kid reminds me so much of myself.

My dad passed away when I was seven and since then I was always the one trying to take care of my mom emotionally and it was so much. I felt that it was my responsibility to fill his shoes and be there for her all the time and make her feel better.

Trust me when I say that it was not supposed to be your responsibility to try and fix your family. You did what you thought you needed to do and you are incredible for it but please try not to put yourself down and blame yourself for events that were completely out of your grasp.

You did your best and that’s more than enough. I’m so sorry for what you had to go through. You should look into therapy or support groups if you think that could suit you. Try finding hobbies to motivate yourself. Maybe living a scheduled life could also help. But most importantly, know that you are strong and that your future is not determined by your past. You’ve got this."

Your move in contacting social services was definitely the right one. You’ll be okay. Just stay strong. I’ve been subject to a ton of psychological and emotional abuse throughout my life and I am so glad you’re taking a stand for yourself and your siblings.

This is definitely an uphill battle but you can win. I know what it’s like to be so afraid and to not feel like anyone will believe me. Especially from my last relationship which was very abusive. But I got out and I’m thriving as much as I can. You will be okay. Have faith in yourself and your strength because we’re not just victims we’re survivors.

So proud of you! You guys will be okay."
AskWomen,fqevzvl,t3_giccgz,1589314510.0,"Personally I just forced myself to spend time to evaluate the situation and see if I was wanting to be with someone because I wanted someone or because I was ready and they were good for me.

Having things to pour that focus into helps a lot. Instead of jumping into relationships or searching for things I just took a step back and tried focusing on myself.

Honestly never really understood my attachment issues until after I left my abusive relationship but now I’m able to think more clearly. Find things you love and invest in yourself. Take things slowly."

I went through the same thing and I've been refraining for a few months now but I never had friends who did so it was difficult to find people who would understand where I was coming from.

This is a very difficult time for us all and I just want to thank you for posting this because it at least shows some hope for progress. You are not alone in feeling lonely or feeling a lack of motivation. Take pride in your progress and even if you relapse (which I have a earlier this year) don't put yourself down too much. It's natural and this is a very difficult process so any progress is worth feeling proud of. You are strong and you can make it through."
StopSelfHarm,fqbfq76,t3_ghv4ph,1589236134.0,"I can relate to this a lot. I've self-harmed for a few years and last year (during my junior year) I was having a really difficult time refraining from it. I tried my best to stop for a while but at the beginning of my senior year I relapsed and honestly, things got worse from there because I had just fell back into my self-destructive cycle. But since that day I haven't done it and trust me when I say that some days have been a major struggle.

I know that anything I, or anyone else, says won't stop you from what you decide to do but hopefully we can at least help. It's been months since I have engaged in self-harm and even on the days where I have to fight the urge so much to the point where I am physically drained, I end up feeling grateful in the long-run. I understand that this is a difficult habit to overcome but when you find yourself in that state, try to find something to distract yourself with if you can. It's easier said than done but everyday without it is a day of progress. If you end up relapsing, don't put yourself down too much. Just try your best to not stop trying, with or without motivation."

Trying to get and stay motivated is extremely difficult and honestly it could take a long time for it to be consistent so try to take it slowly. Maybe try to put yourself on a schedule and work on pushing yourself to be as productive as you can whether you feel the motivation to or not. It will definitely feel horrible but over time it can be helpful.

Also a note on the suicide part, I understand that completely and have gotten close so many times but trust me it will not be worth it. If there's at least one thing you love or are passionate about, try using that as a reason to stay alive. You could try listing one or two thing a day/week that you're grateful for and adding more if you think of something else."
