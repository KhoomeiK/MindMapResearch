How do specialization buildings work when it comes to epic points? Do they give it off per hour, per day, or only at the time i buy it?

As it stands, my storage is on 170, it‚Äôs quite difficult on expanding it since the items are quite rare and can only be obtained thru either GTHQ, pop up bubbles and buying it with simcash (not economical), i would have to free up some space in order to build more items."
