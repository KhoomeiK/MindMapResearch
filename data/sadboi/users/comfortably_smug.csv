Trump stands out bc he’s the highest risk taker out of the group by far. He took some big gambles and they paid off. 

The economy was projected to incline from 2013 so any person in office would have sat through a gainful period but republicans being tax cutters always yield better results and there’s data to prove that. Tax cuts that favor big businesses tend to help with cost of capital for those businesses. It helps create that bullish market. 

A more conservative republican like Cruz or Kasich in office I would’ve probably be around 70% of my gains based on their platform. Bush probably would have been the 2nd best choice. Any democrat I would have been lucky to get 50% of my earnings.

Sandy has the innocent naïveté of a child but he’s not a kid anymore and Herman realizes it. He only wants what is best for him so he threw him in the deep end, so to speak. Also, Herman’s pride is problematic but he also wants to stand his ground for what is rightfully his. He knows his back is against the wall but he doesn’t want to run. He did come unglued a bit in this episode although, he did reel himself back. He hasn’t seen red, yet, but he’s a ticking bomb.

A lot of Jews left nazi Germany to the other side of the border into Poland and France only to later be sent back once hitler invaded there too. About 30% of Jews who emigrated escaped with their lives. For Jews who made it to North America and somehow ended up back in nazi hands is less than 1%. The focus of the show is about not running and what someone does when their back is against the wall. Imagine running to Canada and  the United States falls into fascism.

ThePlotAgainstAmerica,fm6fbeu,t1_fm00gen,1585792795.0,"I feel like what he’s trying to put into context what it was like for the Jews that had to go through forced emigration from Germany and Austria. 

I’ve heard the question of: “Why didn’t Jewish people leave when they had the chance?” You’re hearing the reports on the radio of concentration camps being built and then Herman takes his family to the capital to show them what a great country the United States is, knowing he has a sense of the impending doom. He has so much pride and is the epitome of a patriarch as Bess is the standard of a matriarch. He knows he’s helpless but he can’t run away. They don’t have a lot of money. This made me realize how many people wanted to escape Nazi Europe but didn’t have the means to do so. It’s straight up learned helplessness personified. I’m anxious to see what Herman is going to do.

It’s worth noting that while views on death vary culturally. They vary far more from person to person within any one culture. It comes down to an individual’s personal beliefs. 

Myself as an example. A westerner, Catholic with little to no fear of death but a fear of the unknown. So I’m not afraid of death but what comes after. Meanwhile, some of my more devout family members have no fear of death or of the unknown because of their strong faith. 

I do agree that easterners have a better understanding of death and by and large, less fear of it. I believe it has a lot to do with their religion being 1200 plus years older than those practiced in the west. So basically I feel they’re just ahead of the curve.
