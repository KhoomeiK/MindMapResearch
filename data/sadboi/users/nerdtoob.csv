FortNiteBR,fqo66zo,t1_fqnysrs,1589508387.0,Yeah this is all really confusing to me tbh! If it's etherium does it have actual value? Can I trade these for money or is it reddit exclusive? Can I use coinbase to hold these? Hopefully they make this a little more clear as time goes on but neat idea and I'm super excited to see where this goes!
survivetheculling,fqmjj4i,t1_fqf3vb7,1589478482.0,"You can host your own server on your own PC though? Headless Minecraft servers and killing floor servers and other games have offered sever consoles as software that you can run passively on your PC that routes through your personal internet so in theory it wouldn't cost anything for someone to host a server.

And the price isn't the issue the issue is charging people to get the game just to turn around and charge them to play the game. It's ludicrous and sets a horrible bar for similar greedy schemes from other companies. This one may not be horrible but let's say EA likes this idea and they make it much worse then the next Dev does the same thing because people are paying because they want to play the game, it's a toxic cycle."
survivetheculling,fqmitlc,t1_fqh22lh,1589478151.0,Who in their right mind would pay for a game just to pay for the same game?
survivetheculling,fqmiq0k,t1_fqf5jjq,1589478107.0,This is exactly it it's not the price it's the principle. You should pay to play a game that you paid for to play. It's insane!
survivetheculling,fqmiiay,t1_fqeqmmr,1589478007.0,They haven't updated their Twitter since the initial shut down and as far as I can tell the Xbox store page hasn't been updated and there is complete radio silence but from what I understand crates are still around they are just won instead of purchased. They could've just done a season pass and ditched crates entirely. Or included crates in a season pass. Idk even making the game 20 or 30 bucks would've been better than this shit.
survivetheculling,fqmgwxc,t3_gjke8a,1589477258.0,Is there a website that tracks how many people are playing a game?
survivetheculling,fqlv73j,t1_fqei5q6,1589466676.0,The issue is with this they will have even less players they are making playing the game itself exclusive meaning toward the end of the day queue times will be insanely long after everyone has blown their free matches. This isn't the way to do it and cosmetics have absolutely been proven successful the issue was the loot crate system people don't want to pay for a gamble. Making players pay for the game then pay again to even play the game is greedy. It's either f2p and you play per match (which is still pretty scummy) or pay 20$ or whatever for the game. People would buy it if they care I would absolutely buy it again to avoid this pay model.
survivetheculling,fqlut0h,t1_fqedjqj,1589466470.0,That's what I've been saying. Cosmetics are not the issue the loot crate method was the issue.
survivetheculling,fqlucgw,t1_fqe6lkb,1589466227.0,The issue is they are blind to the actual issue. Skins are fine it's not that skins didn't work it's that loot crates don't work they are no longer a viable option for BR titles.
survivetheculling,fqlu9la,t1_fqegfxj,1589466185.0,They're issue was they went with a gambling loot crate method. A system that players have bashed and received heavy criticism. People want to know what they are in for. They haven't even tried a battle pass method so they have no idea if skins won't work. It's not that skins themselves didn't work it's that loot crates did not work.
survivetheculling,fqls1ou,t1_fqgux36,1589464979.0,Nope they won't sell it they've proven that they'll just let this die along with their studio
survivetheculling,fqlrtvh,t1_fqem7sf,1589464859.0,The f2p skins model was frowned upon because they went with the gamble loot crate method instead of the BP method. They could change it but they won't.
survivetheculling,fqlptqw,t1_fqeignj,1589463740.0,The servers are going to be small as it is with this pay model and they are limiting the amount of players based on skill or who's willing to shell out money? Those queue times are going to be historically long!
survivetheculling,fqlpo3t,t1_fqe9tdr,1589463650.0,Like every other BR title that has proven the battle pass system works and is insanely profitable? You would think it's a no brainier....
survivetheculling,fqlo8n3,t1_fqekvqw,1589462791.0,Maybe something like a battle pass? It's been working in all other br titles. If it aint broke don't fix it they are trying to reinvent the wheel
survivetheculling,fqlnqfo,t1_fqdxh24,1589462485.0,I don't care that it's not free to play I'd pay 20$ to stop this pay model from happening honestly. Even though I own the Original I'd be happy to pay again tbh. It's really a shame...
survivetheculling,fqlniy7,t1_fqgj88f,1589462353.0,This was my original thought as well. Sell the IP if no one picks it up it wasn't worth trying. But you're exactly right it's a fully functioning title that's had hours of work put into it that just needs some love a tweaking. Depending on the price it could be a solid deal and a potentially great game

xboxone,fqll2af,t1_fqexzcu,1589460780.0,Agreed games like this need to serve as a lesson to future devs for a what not to do model.
xboxone,fqlksp4,t1_fqfqp0m,1589460604.0,"Culling origins rerelease could have been a sleeper hit if they just fucking put the time in. It felt like the second they said they would fix it, listen, and bring it to a game the fans were asking for they turned around and abandoned it. They are bored and desperate developers that want instant success. They could learn a thing or two from the like of Hello Games how made promises shit out a game then hunkered down and made it something worth calling home about."
