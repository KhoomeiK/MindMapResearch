Anxiety,fqdln4x,t1_fq8n4w4,1589292217.0,"Thanks for the advice and words of encouragement! I was seeing a psychotherapist a couple months ago, but she had a problem accepting my insurance so I am waiting for her to obtain the correct credentials in order for me to continue seeing her. Unfortunately, this process has come to a halt because of the Coronavirus."
Anxiety,fqdl4q6,t1_fq886gg,1589291933.0,"I have been on the Sertraline since Jan 2020 and gone from 25mg to 50mg to 100mg and when I told my Dr that I still felt more anxious than I would like she said she didn't want to up the dose anymore so she prescribed me 75mg Venlaflaxine on top of the 100mg Sertraline. I didn't really notice any difference when I started taking the Venlafaxine and as more and more time goes by I feel like the Sertraline is working less and less. I know I need to make an appointment but I am putting it off because I just found out last week that my Dr no longer works at the office I go to. Also, my boyfriend has asthma and only partial lung capacity so we are being very cautious about the virus!"

Something I try to remind myself is that I can grow and learn from my mistakes into a better person. I have the choice to not be that person forever."
