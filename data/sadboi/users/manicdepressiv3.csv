PlayStationNow,fr5lvly,t1_fr5d7t9,1589910703.0,"I have both gamepass and psnow and I dont even touch gamepass unless it's for 1 or 2 good games. Psnow has so many good games that I can go from platformers like sly cooper collection to recent titles like control and spiderman. Not to mention the amazing games that were in the service and left (God of War, Uncharted 4, Lost legacy, etc) 

Overall gamepass is nice cause they sometimes put one or two nice games but that's it. I find psnow to be the equivalent of netflix in terms of how many games I can play when I get on"
