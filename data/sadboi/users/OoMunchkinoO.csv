I’m on meds, do therapy, and have a service dog that’s partially for my ptsd.

AMA,fd7lutz,t1_fd63oe0,1578206482.0,"I still spoke to him, I just was very distant for years. 
I had a really close relationship with his wife. One night, about a month before he got his cancer diagnosis, I was crying over a break up and he tried comforting me and telling me it was going to be okay. He stopped drinking, and he had tried to make it up to me, (even though nothing made what he did okay) by being there if I needed him, and being kind to me. I cared for him because despite what he did to me, I still had love for him. He hurt me a lot, but he also did so much for me and helped me in so many ways. 
I decided to help care for him for closure for myself, so he knew I still loved him despite what he did, and for myself because I would hate myself if I didn’t. 
Not part of your question, but after he died I was incredibly sad, but also relieved, because each time I saw him I relived what happened, and it was so hard for me. Getting to say goodbye to him, and tell him I forgave him was closure for me. I knew at that point he could never hurt me again."

You can see my dogs for yourself. I have a service dog in training, and a fully trained service dog. I went through the entire training process with my first dog, she’s amazing, but I want a little extra help with my new dog, because I want the lowest chance of her washing possible, which is why I asked about starfleet. I never said my puppy will be perfect in advanced obedience, I just said were working on it."

My current color isn’t super dark but it isn’t super light either, the color blue I’m going for is probably Artic Fox aquamarine. Would it be possible to get my hair light enough or..?"
