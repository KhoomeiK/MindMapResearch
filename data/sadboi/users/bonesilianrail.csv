They cry so much when a dog dies in a film while they scarf on a hamburger which contains an actual pig carcass. I suppose it's about people not making the connection. We have lived with cats as companion animals for years however have farmed and exploited cows, chickens, etc. in the meantime. People don't associate meat with actual animals. They view farm animals as commodities, not sentient beings. Makes no sense right \*facepalm\*"

Yes it's horrific, but it's important to talk about these things to educate people and make them understand that the world isn't all sunshine and lollipops.

He also displays symptoms of schizophrenia and his dad also has this.

DontFuckWithCats,fh76fi8,t3_f1gosv,1581316891.0,"I agree with you too, without the FB group Luka would've still been caught. However through their sleuthing they definitely provided the investigation with invaluable information about all of his online sock puppet accounts/aliases and photos. Also, they did suspect it was Luka before the police did. And they did contact authorities regarding the kitten videos, however nothing was done about it. Perhaps if he was prosecuted, the murder of Jun Lin wouldn't have happened. It was still very interesting to watch them discover who it was and also thrilling to see how close they came to exposing him."
