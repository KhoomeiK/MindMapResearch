That's no good because when a toxic woman is done with you, she moves on quickly and you are left with repressed anger, a deaden sex drive, increased destructive habits and a broken heart you didn't break. They condition you to muzzle yourself. But each time I stood up and said I'm out to a toxic woman, they cried and begged which is the number 1 sign of a toxic woman. Back and forth smh"
AskReddit,fr3wijc,t3_gkvj59,1589868268.0,"One main thing I noticed about toxic women, they spend the beginning trying to CONVINCE you they are a good woman or would make a good girlfriend.  Their actions say otherwise but those are the most dangerous ones because they want you close for whatever reason and man, it's dangerous if you fall for any bs they say. They just wanna lead you on with no real plans for you. Just to feed their ego. Even the me they want they seem to try and manipulate. I've seen this way too many times. I seem to attract that type. They want you to lookl9 at them a certain way. Control what you think about them. And right when you're close enough, shit hits the fan.


And ego boosting. They just try so hard to boost you up. I mean I know women like to give their man a little boost, but this certain type of toxic woman just does the most unnecessary toxic boosting. It's a control mechanism. She just wants to see what you'll react to so she can see what to use against you when she's pissed.

datingoverthirty,fqrpcwa,t3_gkbv0z,1589589065.0,"Wow.....you must be either dating my son's mom or you're my distant kin. Before I offer any advice let me tell you my experience.


I was in a bad relationship where I was cheated on. I left her and moved on. Thought it couldn't get any worse than an attention seeker. Cheater and liar.

I was wrong....


I met my son's mom. I had completely healed at the time and I had some lady friends. Not bragging at all I'm just saying this, I had options. But my son's mom, her personality was just so laid back. She didn't force a relationship on me, we talked and clicked like nothing. As we grew closer it slowly grew darker. She went thru the EXACT same thing you just described about the one you know now. Her emotions were radical. Not in a chaotic way but in a very moody way. She had some very suspect ways. I mean, very. There were NUMEROUS red flags but I had fallen by this time and was in too deep. She would try to make me jealous, say things to make me react in am insecure way. Ignore me on purpose and then text later to say she was just seeing if she could go a day without talking to me. Bullshit. She wanted to see if I was desperate. She wanted me to lose control because she somewhat was losing hers. She had insomnia before she met me. After she met me, she slept like a baby. 

She did so many things that drove me crazy and they were all mental tactics. All the red flags were there and it got darker as time grew on. We split 2 years ago and I have a handsome boy about to be 3 that I wouldn't change for the world but here I am, rebuilding my life at 32 from the floor up with a heart that beats passion when I see a woman who no longer loves me. It hurts. Because it's so obvious she moved on.



What I'm saying bro is trust your gut. My instincts told me 3 times to leave her alone but I stayed and got destroyed. She was very abusive, even worse than the cheater. She did so many things to trigger me and embarrass me. It was horrible. Just proceed with caution. You seem like a stable minded dude. I'm not saying your situation will turn out like mine but take it from me.....chaotic ppl will always be chaotic. I have toxic former friends and a toxic sibling. My sons mom and I started out just like this and alot could have been avoided. You don't want the scars if you think this ain't it. Trust me bro......."

abusiverelationships,fqp74n4,t1_fqoz62r,1589537406.0,"I think your therapist was on to something. I had a very murky childhood. There are some instances that stand out that I felt extremely neglected. On top of that, when ppl got mad at me as a child I was frozen out for days. It's odd that you said that because I kinda rehashed some things.

And I think what it is is they seek someone who seems ""controllable"". Doesn't have alot attached to them socially, pretty quiet and kinda Mysterious. Just not an open book. I think they like drama but need stability but can't let the need for drama go. 8nwas VERY self destructive with my ex. Since we've split, I stopped smoking cigarettes about 8-9 months ago and I let drinking go. I'll drink on the weekend but I'm not a big fan of it honestly and thinking about letting it go period. She turned me into an angry person. And trust me I understand gaslighting. Boy......it occurred our entire relationship. I went thru that with her with 2 different dudes. One was her oldest son's father whom she always put on a pedestal even tho he took her thru hell. The other was with a dude she had to be real drawn to. Looking back at it, I would never be with her again. I lost alot and still recovering but you should never feel like to have to compete for love.

I definitely would never, ever seek a reunion with her but I still gotta deal with my emotions. The shock of thinking I had a family and the anger of some things she has done and how hard she can be to co parent with.


Identify what it is you feel first and then allow yourself to heal. It's hard but figure out what it is keeping you feeling this way. He says he's not interested, id definitely put my heart in my pocket. I'm sure my son's mom knows how I feel as I am brief with her and avoid eye contact lol I think I'm pretty transparent but I just want our meetings brief.  Just to protect myself because she can be the one to say something that will cut me deeper than I could even try to hurt her. So protect your feelings. I wouldn't open up about how I feel. She will NEVER know how I truly feel"
BreakUps,fqo7ndu,t3_gd91kk,1589509245.0,"I feel your pain. I went thru something similar but we were only together two years. And for some it's easy, for others it's hard. Thought I had moved on until recently when I was just bombarded with dreams. So after a year and a half, my true wounds are open and boy, it's tough.


BUT, boundaries. I just pick my son up and drop him off and we don't talk about much during that exchange. Sometimes she text here and there about other stuff but for the most part I just react dry. From DAY 1!! I kept it about my son. Only about him and not much else. Only she brings up small talk and it's rare. But when you see that they've obviously and clearly moved on, it helps. And my son doesn't allow me to think about much outside of him. 


Boundaries are important tho, for you. She won't cross them or she may but either way keep your contacts brief and to the point. Nothing worse than lending yourself to a person who doesn't feel the same about the notion. And I have NOT ONCE asked my son's mom for another chance nor do I talk about her to anyone. Yet, because ppl know me, when they tell her theyve seen me she pretty much throws in my face that she has moved on. She's done that 3 times and that's with just ppl telling her they saw me. Let me tell ya, that's painful. Especially when they put an emphasis on it. So keep it brief. Just get your kiddos and only talk about changing info. Almost 2 years bro and I'm finally at the end of moving on. It's hard but I just know I'm close to where I wanna be again mentally and emotionally."
abusiverelationships,fqnobqx,t1_fqnmmsw,1589498484.0,"Hey! Glad you could relate and I'm hoping that you've passed the tough part. As for him, in a way he has said it. He says he is ""molding them"". I find it abusive in every form and i can't be around that kinda stuff. He kinda admits it and we've touched on it a few times but it didn't go far. His actions shows how he likes to prey on what he preceives as weak. He always been extremely insecure but always hid behind bravado. 


It's funny how you say that they know because they do. My ex whom I still have to see because of our child was kinda like this. She would purposefully do things to see if I would react. She would call it insecure but what man in his right mind what's to hear you damn near brag on an ex(she showed me him 3 times)amongst other head games. My confidence was what she hated at least to me. They all hate confident ppl. Control was a HUGE thing for her and still is. She has an ego I'd expect from a man. It's almost like they have to have that one person they can constantly run over but what's odd is they are addicted to ppl who are wild and uncontrollable. It excites them. I am mild mannered. I am reserved and for the most part self controlled because my past was extremely destructive. Because of this, I'm kinda a pick for abusive and toxic women and they never show it at first but the times they had I was too invested. Now I can sniff it out so fast.



Nothing is reciprocated with them. But they want you in the safe zone first before they can unleash on you. And it's slow. It's like a need for them because they have no control over what is going on internally. And although I did mess up sometimes, I definitely was never disrespectful. Never hateful. Never disappeared. Never made her look foolish in front of company. I'm still healing from the residual anger and it's been almost 2 years. That's why I try and help those who have been thru. Because as a man I know how it feels. And something definitely needs to change in me if toxic ppl attract to me. 


Even the ones who aren't abusive that are just liars and manipulators, it's still sad to see. They want you safe, isolated and want to know every angle so you get trapped in while they have the key. Sorry if I sound bitter lol this is just an area I'm an expert in"

AstralProjection,fqmna4p,t3_gjg4lj,1589480283.0,"I look at it like this, it's more of a shell. A reflective shell. I believe it kinda blinds the consciousness until we can become conscious within the dream. This takes great emotional and mental control. We have to first work thru both the emotional and mental energy. It reflects thru our dreams. But when we can finally manage to cleanse both, I think we reach pure consciousness and this is where AP becomes possible. It's the main reason that the mental energy needs to be cleansed because what you may see during AP will be so shocking you think that you're dreaming and it will be difficult to do again. 


So in my opinion, no they aren't different regions in space or time but rather our energy reflecting what is on it and what must be overcome to get to the truth"
abusiverelationships,fqmkcvm,t3_gjmsyj,1589478875.0,"Hey! You survived it and learned! And take it from a man also, I have met two women back to back like this. Like you said it starts out small and slow. For me it always started with criticism and head games. Attempting to make me insecure by practically BRAGGING on ex's or showing me certain ex's. If I was to react negatively as I feel like that's unnecessary then I'd be labeled insecure and stonewalled. I went thru so many emotional games and roller coasters. Especially with the last one. It was the most emotionally abusive and traumatic experience I've had in a while. To be lied to, lied on and just flat out disrespected at times made me feel like so much less of a man. I'm just not recovering after the same time frame as you, just closer to 2 years. I have a childhood friend who does this to all his women. It's why we stopped hanging out. He likes women he can control. His current one, I feel so badly for because he is in his early 30s like me and she is just 21. She looks so.....dejected when she's with him. And it's so bad that he wouldn't even go to a bar with me without her. He pretty much said that bringing her keeps him from getting so fucked up. The scene when he is with her is literally like a victim in chains. And he argued with her and would ""joke"" that she could give me a ride because he knows we wouldn't fuck each other. His insecurities are HIGH.


So kudos to you for this. I let my close friend go because he acts like this with all his women. Two ex's, one I have a child by so I gotta always see, were like this. She had a dude comment on her post when we were together. I asked who he was and she flat out lied. Then when I found out it was an ex, I approached her calmly as it was still early in the relationship and she blew TF up. Always used to tell me that I would never know if she cheated on me and accused me of being controlling because I asked why she parked so far away from the apartment. Think I Dodged a bullet there. Wish you the best. This was a great read! And AGAIN I say congrats on walking away AND learning!"

Mars Neptune, to me especially with the conjunction is purposeful deceit.  An active cover up. Neptune is a blind spot, what is hidden or even subliminal. Of course it means more I'm just covering some basics. It's definitely complex. And Mars will always act as a trigger 

The sun squaring this shows that a focus or spotlight will be put on this. Being I Gemini, I can only guess it will come in the form of information. All the research we have been told or have seen is what will cause the focus. The square shows a standoff of sorts. ""THATS NOT WHAT WE WERE TOLD"".

She is the most evil, most hateful person I have ever met in my life. She went thru a rejection that would destroy ppl. Her entire class stopped clapping for her on purpose during her graduation. It hurt my soul and hers more so. She never recovered and turned into an abusive rage a holic. I won't go into detail but she has turned into a very evil person 

I know someone else with it who is a Scorpio but has the exact same placements. He overcame alot. Dealt with being bullied but overcame it and was one tough ass dude but man is he a good person. Real kind hearted, not a bully but a man. You won't ever run him over. But he wasn't the type to walk on ppl. Just know his reputation proceeds him but he was a good dude and strong as a fucking bull.


My dad has Mars opposite Saturn. From what I've heard about his past, he was NOT to be fucked with. Rarely blew up but when he did, Jesus it was something to see. He likes to hunt, he is very very distant and still had a fighters spirit. But he also had to overcome bullying before he came out his shell. Been to juvie in the 70s, been to the pen, he was just a gangster from start to finish and I'm not glorifying it I'm just surprised because of who he is today. Didn't meet him until I was 17 and we still rarley speak but I've hear so many stories about him.


My grandma who raised me also had a Mars opposite Saturn. Kind as can be but you push her, or if she is triggered.....she could be abusive. Some of the whoppings I got were flat out beatings. Her temper when she exploded was terrifying. But she was very sweet, caring and loyal 


I find that mars-saturn ppl deal with bullying early on and suppression and it makes for a damn steamroller later in life. But when they overcome their powerful anger, they are loyal as hell and can be extremely sacrificial, sharing and kind hearted.

And I've found sun ppl to be a bit overbearing and very demanding. 


But for the sake of this, I have some tight Pluto aspects. Mercury and Venus conjunct Pluto in the 2nd and my leo moon squares Pluto from the 11th. Doesn't look so intense but it is, trust me it is. And those emotionally in tune, I can't hide it from. But I am very controlled. I do slow releases and sometimes I do get a little destructive. Sometimes I do things I regret but I always come back and do damage control."

astrology,fprep0x,t1_fprde72,1588852079.0,Haha that is so crazy. I still stutter from time to time but it's kind of out of nervousness. I also have Uranus there too so Saturn tends to slow me down on days where I'm just everywhere and it's great to hear from others with this placement!

As I grew older I learned to communicate so much better. It's actually my strong point. Tbh, I always excelled on English in high school. I was in Pre AP classes in Jr. High.


You just gotta learn ya style. I learned that I'm kinda a slow speaker who likes to cover all his points. But boy when I'm rolling, I'm hard to stop. I also have a mercury conjunct Pluto. 


My biggest issue is I like to be right. I don't have to be but I like to be because all my life I've been told I'm wrong so I tried to balance this b always making sure I'm right"

astrology,fpr5tpi,t3_gex23n,1588843467.0,"I have my moon square Jupiter and I don't really have emotional tension. It just gives me a deeper moral compass and makes me so much more sympathetic. I can be rather distant at times and fluctuate but trust me, nobody needs emotional freedom more than moon-uranus ppl. I just hate emotionally demanding ppl who tend to wanna make me feel bad for not being as clingy as them. I tend to hope for the best and don't stay down in the dumps too long. That's what Jupiter does to the moon in my eyes."

astrology,fpr55it,t3_gf2xth,1588842765.0,"My sister has a 12th house Mars and her rage is extremely unrelenting. She relies on it and I honestly feel like it has caused a personality split for her. A very deep one.

Someone close to me has a Venus, mercury and Pluto there and although she wasn't so hidden, she was very deep and had a side to her that surprised me alot. She slowly revealed things to me and I slowly picked up on them also. Maybe because my Venus, mercury and Pluto all fell in her 12th too."
astrology,fpr4ym3,t3_gezv8x,1588842561.0,Knowledge and wisdom are FREE. Astrology is better self taught because perspective is everything in this thing. How astrology looks to one doesn't seem to be the case for another. And ppl use different house systems too. It's a plethora of things on Google to learn from. Just my take. Took me 3 years mainly to finally break astrology down.

astrology,fpohulo,t3_gemc43,1588784756.0,"Transits and astrology as a whole are double sided. You still have I live your life and be practical. Transits are not specific per se they are more like forecast. Saturn based on its history and what occured during its strongest transits has the name it has for a reason. Saturn is more about the harvest growing. You get what you put in. It's more about karma than restrictions. So an opposition to a transit Saturn is just a blind spot. You may do better than you imagine or worse but the karma comes unexpectedly. The trine, you see it coming. The conjunction and square you kinda deal with as it comes.


Pluto is about recreation. So whatever is worn out and outdated or simply destructive will become an issue and you will have to cut it off or accept that this is you and figure out how to control it 

Jupiter is about morals and higher learning it seeking it. With it's transits your morals come into question and you will come across situations where you learn more than just the basics about a topic. Might not even be religion. It just expands period. You can run across just as many atheists and doubters as you can shamans and teachers with Jupiter 


The main thing is it's a forecast, not a predicator. It's just showing you energy that's coming and how your energy deals with it. You still have to live life. Remember everything is dual natured. My Saturn transits look so piss poor but honestly this has been one of the most calmest moments of my life"

COVID19positive,fpg10p6,t1_fpf2b8b,1588590819.0,"This happened to me when I was 11. My grandfather who had helped raised me(step grandpa at that)was dying from cancer. He was on hospice care in my bedroom and sometimes I would wake up in the middle of the night scared he had died. He had gotten bad off to where they took him to a care facility. My last day seeing him alive, he reached for my hand. I turned away and cried. I couldn't do it. He was all I knew because I had no father. I'm 32 now and to this day I have dreams of him dying in my arms. But he knew I loved him as I'm sure your friend knew you loved her. Those final moments stick out the most but the overall relationship is what matters most. I was there for my paw paw but that was just too much. Some can handle it and some can't.

Not in a self harm way just letting my pain be. I used to try and drown it out but now I understand I AM my pain. My scars, my wounds, they always form who I am. Because I learn from them. There is beauty in pain because of the intense need to survive. It's just....man it can drain you. I'm so glad I posted this because hearing from someone else how this is, it is therapeutic.
