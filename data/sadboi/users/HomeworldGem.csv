If you‚Äôre looking for Pikachu, you can get him for free, in the first train station, by talking to the stranger. He references Pok√©mon Go (or something like that.) and how he brought Pikachu over."
gaming,f870614,t1_f86gkcv,1574311632.0,"I would like to see fat Pikachu brought back. Over the years, he‚Äôs gotten skinnier. I still think the character is cute though."
gaming,f8700hh,t1_f86fu2z,1574311495.0,"No problem! And it‚Äôs cool. At one point, I stopped playing a little after the GBA games. But before the DS games. I picked the game back up when Pok√©mon Black came out, and replayed the series. I think I was like, five or six? But I remember playing the card games too. 

I would also say that you have access to the Pokemon Box, while on the go. Which is different from what the game was initially. Leveling up is faster in this game, to an extent. I‚Äôd also recommend buying the online play. Only because players have useful items when you click the A button, for your camp. Or, just items in general. In the Wild, when you catch Pok√©mon, or go near the glowing caverns and interact with them, you‚Äôll earn Watts. Those Watts can be exchanged for a multitude of goods from particular challengers. Such as Pokeball‚Äôs, TM‚Äôs, to things for your camp, and buying Big Pearls that you can cash in on. In case you‚Äôre concerned about the interaction of online play for your little one, you can‚Äôt use a microphone or anything to interact. I hope this doesn‚Äôt sound weird to say, but, I know a lot of parents, and some of my friends were concerned when I mention the online play. 

Also, the clothing customization allows you to buy uniforms to battle in Gyms with. But, you don‚Äôt have to buy them. After the gym battles, you will eventually get that specific gym leaders uniform, for free, with your own chosen numbers. It is definitely different, I feel the change is needed. 

If you aren‚Äôt sure about spending the funds for the game, check eBay. Most games are about $10-$15 cheaper after they come out. Some sellers do have new copies too. Or try GameFly for a trial. Sometimes they have free two week trials. I‚Äôm sorry for the long winded monologues, I like giving detailed answers. üòÖ"

For me, I remember when the game came out as a kid in the 90‚Äôs. And seeing the Pok√©mon wander, as I get to explore is the fun part for me. The bike is a must in the Wilds, which, you‚Äôll eventually get after the first gym. 

You can‚Äôt always catch the Pok√©mon, until leveling up, and beating certain gyms. But, it makes me want to go back. I personally haven‚Äôt gotten far in the game. (I‚Äôm about to go to the third gym.) I don‚Äôt mind the automatic experience points. I don‚Äôt even mind the gym challenges since most gyms had them anyway, but, it wasn‚Äôt separate as it is in this game. I feel
Hop is a realistic rival, who looks up to his brother. 

I like the character customizations too, and the feel of Gala. Getting the starters is different without giving much away. But, naming the Pok√©mon, and deleting moves, or adding them, is different too. (Some Pokemon center places have the move addition/deletion person.) The game incorporates some elements of Pok√©mon Let‚Äôs Go. Such as seeing stronger Pok√©mon with an aura of light. 

Gigantamax is a cool little thing for gyms, and outside the gyms. (In terms of catching the Pok√©mon.) It isn‚Äôt at will like other games with the powering up feature. (Can‚Äôt think of the name of it right now.) I personally have trouble connecting to other players when I want to catch these Pok√©mon. But, you can have NCP‚Äôs help
you too. 

Occasionally I see the game lag a TINY bit when my switch is off the dock. On the dock, it isn‚Äôt bad at all. It is more to do with playing online. Then you‚Äôll see more people in your fields. But, they help you too with certain items for your camp. And camping is something else I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd spend a fair amount of time doing. It clears stat issues, heals your Pok√©mon, enables you to get closer to them, and you‚Äôll gain EXP. 

Personally, despite the naysayers, I‚Äôve enjoyed this game so far. It does seem a bit easier, but, I‚Äôm at the beginning of the game. I hope you‚Äôll try the game, and that you‚Äôll enjoy it too.

I‚Äôve spent so much time already Pok√©mon hunting in the wild areas. And it is so cool seeing all the different Pok√©mon wonder. 

I understand why there is frustration, and outcry with some players when encountering wild Pok√©mon, and they are higher leveled. But from a game designer perspective; it is to ensure the game is balanced and not broken. I encountered a Noibat at level 26, my Pok√©mon was level 17. I managed to get its health down to next to nothing, but, was not physically able to catch the Pok√©mon. The message of ‚ÄúIt will not let its guard down‚Äù kept popping up when I tried. But, I DID get a large amount of Experience Points. 

They managed fed to capture the essence and vastness of the Pok√©mon World. It is plated beautifully. I have seen a few other players roam the wilds, but, nothing crazy yet. 

I‚Äôve tried the Dynamaxing (I am sorry if I spelled that wrong.) feature, but, so far, I couldn‚Äôt connect to other players. I have been able to Link Trade randomly. 

Also, I haven‚Äôt had any issues with the frame rates. I‚Äôm not sure if it matters or not, but, I have the first release Switch; and all the different loading screens work quickly, and perfectly.

I listen to their conversations and how they speak. I try to relate my experiences with their own, ask open ended questions, and make them laugh. 

Your body language also plays a factor. If you approach someone, your arms are crossed, and your head is down, you aren‚Äôt showing yourself to be open. I should also add how you speak, and carry yourself is a factor too. Sometimes when I have upset customers, or angry customers, I change my tone to say something in a softer way, than I normally would. 

Be polite and respectful.

Watch what people are wearing, and see if it relates to anything of similar interests. For example, if someone is wearing a Kingdom Hearts shirt, they like video games. Think of some games that are similar to that game, or the genre. (Maybe some RPG‚Äôs in this case.) 

Edit: I‚Äôve worked retail for a long time, but, I‚Äôm a bubbly, social person."
