The problem is people like the poster on this thread (who now has deleted all his angry posts), who spout nothing but hyperbole and insults, and try to shout down sufferers like me because they can. Then you have academic studies like this one (released just this week) that show, no, it’s not just people with renal failure who have reactions:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022202X19314721?dgcid=author

The FDA agrees that some gadolinium is retained by everyone, and that Gadolonium is a heavy metal toxin. It also agrees some people can have life threatening reactions to it. For 20 years, they said Gadolonium was totally safe! Then in 08 they said it wasn’t for folks with renal failure. 

Why is it unreasonable to think, based on all the info above, that it could be dangerous for others? 

Again, some people will need an mri with contrast because their life is on the line. Then you need to decide the risk, but you also need to know more info. And the more people like the angry poster on this thread shout down people like me, the less info you’ll have."
