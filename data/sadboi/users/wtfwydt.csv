Most modern feminists would think this is laughable. They don't want somebody mansplaining to them. You really think just because you have a penis that you have some amazing lessons to teach that women haven't had access to for CENTURIES?!? I'm pretty sure even feminists would disagree. You, however, seem like you have some sense. You don't seem to be an extreme, man-hating feminist. 

It sounds like you're saying there is a place for masculinism, considering our emotional illiteracy and devaluation of our own lives?"

This often causes a male with an average sized penis to fall into ""small penis syndrome"", which has a myriad of negative psychological and sometimes physical effects. Even if presented with a sexual opportunity, these males will often decline the opportunity out of fear of humiliation, and the possibility of gossip about his ""small"" penis."
