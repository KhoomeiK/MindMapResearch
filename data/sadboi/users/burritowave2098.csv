To this day, he still doesn’t really appreciate how it affected me. How can someone “not know” whether staying with an abusive spouse is the right choice or not? It’s fucked. Other than that, while I sort of appreciate his financial help during school- he’s the one that pressured me into going back, and later into staying, despite the debt it would have cost me.

I suppose you’re assuming I’m just an all-around asshole who is mostly worried about myself, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I’m actually really angry about the repercussions on people who 1. Are too poor to “stock up” (hoard) and 2. Are sick, or old, and can’t get to the store. 

Also— the people who shop at my store and hoard food are mostly doing it out of concern for THEMSELVES. They have no thought for others. How do I know this? They litter their hand wipes, old drinks, and straws in the carts for us to clean up. That’s a disease vector right there, and if I happened to be a carrier with no symptoms, I would definitely spread it. By putting me at risk, they do it to EVERYONE ELSE. It’s always the people who take like 5 hand wipes and walk out with a full cart, too. 

You did have a good point about whether or not I would stockpile food in that scenario. The answer is no, I would not. Why? Because there are other ways of getting food. Our store has partnered with favor to do free curbside and delivery. I don’t order more than I need. I know if worst came to worst, I could favor it. Also???? I couldn’t if I wanted to! I’m on a cashier salary! It’s ok, I’ve gone years without cooking for myself from the grocery store- I can order pizza, or even (wait for it) free DELIVERY from my grocery store cuz my company is doing that now. And guess what??? The gov is NOT shutting down the grocery store! Worst happens, we’ll “go dark” and force everyone to order online. With product limits. We just implemented limits on some items. The food zombies are all getting their panties in a twist now cuz we have product limits. It’s funny to watch. 

Basically- there are a zillion other ways of not starving besides hoarding from the grocery store. And the people that do, from what I have seen, are not doing it out of concern for spreading the virus. Just for not getting theirs. Exactly what u accused me of there. Cool."

BPDrecovery,fb0azme,t1_faypz33,1576424395.0,"This is relatable. My dad finally divorced my mom when I was 22 and in rehab. So he managed to get out of the situation with minimal problems and remarry. He will never, ever acknowledge any responsibility. He just resents me for what I put him through for having problems as a result of growing up with the hosebeast. I don’t think he gets it at all. Plus I’m an only child so there is literally no one who can bear witness."

BPDrecovery,faw0drm,t1_favuzz8,1576364277.0,"You’re doing the right thing, and that’s all you can do. Other people’s reactions to your news are beyond your control and not really your responsibility. It’s a rough process; try not to beat yourself up. 

There should be an end to this. Just be transparent. It’s ok to set boundaries with people. 

Lastly- before you talk to your ex- first ask and make sure she wants to hear all that you have to say. If she doesn’t, leave the door open and let it go. There’s no reason to beat yourself up forever."
BPDrecovery,faul6ky,t1_f9q4i3m,1576349195.0,Sometimes I wonder if the biggest contributing factor to this disorder was being the family scapegoat. Hard to form your own identity when everyone just projects all their garbage onto you. Also family is the biggest obstacle to getting better because they need an “identified patient”
BPDrecovery,faswn1c,t3_eahfb0,1576332300.0,"First, you have to tell other people the truth about your smear campaign. It’s not going to be pleasant. I’ve done this kind of cleanup before after I got into recovery, and it caused a lot of people to just stop talking to me. I don’t blame them. But, it’s the right thing to do. There is no other way to fix it. When they ask you why you lied, you don’t have to tell them about BPD; people usually piece it together if you say you were hiding a drug problem or were insecure. Honestly, it doesn’t matter. What matters here is repairing the damage you caused to her life. 

Second, after you give her some space, try to write it all down. See if you can organize your thoughts. And be ready to answer questions. 

Good on you for taking responsibility"

BPDsraisedbyBPDs,faelgg0,t3_diksat,1576003117.0,"Coming from another BPD, so I know this is really hard but. . . Try not to take it too personally. 

I used to post on there while I was in denial about my condition. I understand the blanket impulse to just write off everyone with BPD. Especially since my mother kind of made me this way by being BPD herself, and I’m still trying not to hate her for it."
BPDrecovery,f9w4co1,t3_cvqc5v,1575686796.0,"Well. . . It’s good that you don’t regret having them, because they’re here. I don’t know if it is always 100% irresponsible for people like us to have kids. I do know that my mom transmitted her BPD to me. I can’t help but wish I was never born, because living with this is awful. I think it is irresponsible to encourage pwBPD to have kids without first getting into treatment and learning skills to manage symptoms. I’d love to have a family of my own some day, if I manage to recover. But I also have what I think is a very healthy fear of repeating the cycle."
BPDrecovery,f9w3h1d,t3_e6tpes,1575686377.0,Yes I do. My BPD mom and idiot dad did this to me. I hate her for making me into her.
