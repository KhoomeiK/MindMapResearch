stopdrinking,fl4cp8u,t3_fmbpuk,1584810753.0,"Day 25. Today is the first day where I was really tired and wanted to unwind and the first relaxation method that came into my head was not a glass of wine or G&T. My first thought was a lazy bubble bath followed by a nap.

I am really happy about this especially because I’ve been actively searching for things to replace my drinking. I know from my past failed attempts to stop drinking that  msuccessful sobriety requires one to deal with their triggers head-on and find new, healthy coping mechanisms.

I will not drink with you today."

Today was tough. Serious cravings. 
I had to dig deep not to give in. 

It’s now evening and I’m in bed, watching a series and drinking water kefir. 

This journey has peaks and troughs

stopdrinking,fko1i61,t3_fjhgup,1584378260.0,"I’m on 20 days dry today!! First time in 4 years that I’ve give this long without drinking. 

My skin and body love it. 
My work productivity is improving noticeably (I used to spend 1.5 days of the working week hungover)
My parenting is more present 

I have had pretty strong cravings which I fed 0% gin 
and de-alcoholised wine (I now keep some in the house for weak moments)

I feel great! I’m really happy about reaching this small milestone and feeling so positive.

datingoverthirty,evtkkui,t1_evsvcih,1564772399.0,"I agree with this. It’s time for you to pause and let him initiate and take the lead. Be responsive positively if/when he calls, texts or asks you out. 

If he does not reach out then move on. Tbh despite the protestations it’s sadly quite likely that he isn’t that into you based on your narrative."
