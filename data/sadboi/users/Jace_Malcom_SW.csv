And i'm no movie critic so i can't make any good arquments but tlj atleast made sense. It was clear what was going ln as it started right after tfa but with tros we r thrown into a time no know knows shit about. We don't know how much time has passed since the last jedi, could be weeks, could be months could be years. Also we have no idea how the resistance got where they were at the beginning of the movie. How they got to the planet they use as a base, how they found all the ships and how there were so many of them as only 30-40 resistance members supposedly survived tlj. Also palpatine is randomly back with no explanation how. U see what i mean? It's just jump in the future with no context about how we got there. It just feels like there's a movie missing between tlj and tros. U can try watching anh and after that rotj, skipping tesb, i bet it just makes rotj feel weird."

SequelMemes,fbd85hq,t1_fbc16nf,1576751755.0,It's very much a a rotj copy in a way. It has too much old and too little new and it leaves many character arcs in the half way.
