I want to constantly talk to someone. But at the same time I want to be alone. I want to be seen for who I am. Not for who my parents think I am. They won’t believe me. And they won’t accept me. 

I am so close to losing. But I have big dreams. I want to become a Officer. Or a physiologist. Or even a profiler. Always have. But some days it felt so far away. Am I even allowed to do it? Will I? I have to keep up in the race of life. But it felt like I broke both of my legs and yet still expected to run.

NonBinaryTalk,f5omngw,t3_dokdn6,1572322798.0,"When I was a young child, I didn’t even know non-binary was a real thing (growing up in a small town in the Bible Belt is sucky). And I thought that all children were like this. I would want to play with both “male” and “female” toys. I would prefer wearing neutral clothing (I.e. pants and tee shirt, even though I would get something feminine due to my parents buying them). But wouldn’t mind wearing dresses when need. 

When I got older and the first sign of puberty started. I was like “Okay no big deal. Everyone go through this”. But nothing felt right? Is that the right way to say it? Well anyways. I always liked to be referred to as my name. When it was say “young lady” something felt wrong. But one time going to my mom wanting a more short name. She started naming off boyish names that I recoiled at. That felt like a big no. 

That’s just my experience anyways. So know that you’re not the only one. I mean. I found out about me being non-binary a year ago when I found out what it was."

And I obsess over it if I didn’t.  On the same note I also start panicking if I can’t. Thinking I was the sole cause of the fight. And that it’s my fault. And I have to fix it or people will stop talking to me. It’s so toxic and mentally hurtful. That it feels suffocating. I talked to my therapist about it. And it has gotten better. But I realize how so toxic it is.
NonBinaryTalk,f3uu150,t3_dicmn7,1571167419.0,"For me I was “gender blind” as a kid. I thought it was normal. I didn’t under the binary. And was repeatedly told what to do and what I can do. I didn’t know what non-binary is. And I wish I was able to find out sooner. One time I remember as a kid wanting a shorter name. A somewhat boyish name. But when mom had “jokingly” called some names, I instantly shut down her, and she asked me why. Knowing she was making me uncomfortable. All I knew is that it didn’t feel right being called a boy. 

As I started growing up it seemed harder for me to find what was making me uncomfortable. Why I felt sick over certain things. And why I felt as if I couldn’t care less about others. All I knew is that something wasn’t right. When I found out about being non-binary, it just clicked for me. It made sense why I didn’t associate myself with female. Despite having to do things females have too (etc. different P.E. Classes separated by male and female. Having to use female bathroom and such) it was just a routine. Something I didn’t like. But something I had to do. I was quickly in and out. Trying to just be in the background. A lot of things like that, the things before hand that I remember now, makes me go “make sense now” . Sometimes I feel like I’m faking it. Because I want to wear feminine things like jewelry, and I got scared I was just faking it. But I realize I can present with how I feel comfortable. And that’s all that matters. It’s still a struggle. But one I know I can get through."
NonBinaryTalk,f3d2u04,t1_f3bpd49,1570831188.0,"In all honesty. These words made my day today. I didn’t find out about non-binary until I was fifteen. I always felt as though something wasn’t right. I always thought I was a “tomboy” but as I grew older it became more and more present in my life. I remember a few memories, asking why I couldn’t have a “boys” toy and being confused. Suddenly wanting to change my name but it never felt right when mom “jokingly” started naming off short boy names that I hated. Trying my dads shampoo and using moms body wash, and feeling some small sense of triumph. And always hating my chest, and other of the feminine things that were suppose to be biologically correct. I just didn’t feel like a female while I could tolerate somethings. And almost being so close to telling my mom, and crying, but not able to. She just brushed off my feelings as me not having a normal cycle, when I get sick during that.

It’s just the little things. And I still feel like a imposter. And sometimes I just want to cry over it.

But still. This comment did make my day knowing that there is some experiences like my own, especially since I live in a small town where it feels so isolating at times."

It just really depends on the environment you grew up in. Of course that is not always the case, it’s just better to keep it a secret and stay safe until you have a plan if things go wrong.

I find it brave to talk about this. And I’m glad that I have helped you. Another suggestion from reading your comment is to maybe bring up that time? And how it had affected you, even if you see it in a positive light as something to help you grow stronger, and then open up to what led to that. However it is just a suggestion do what feels comfortable for you. 

I heard it isn’t uncommon to feel that way when talking about who you are. I had to deal with that as well. Feeling like I have no gender but because I use to wear feminine stuff, even though I had too since my mom kept picking and buying my clothes as well as liking some jewelry pieces, I was a imposter and I couldn’t tell anyone. Until I actually came out to some of my friends by playing never have I ever on the back of the buss while going home from a trip. That’s what made me realize I wasn’t a imposter. That this was how I felt. Even though I quickly slipped back into that mindset. Since telling my friends however. I felt more comfortable. 

I started exploring and found a style combining some men’s (and some feminine shirts to help convince my mom, but made sure they didn’t cause me discomfort) shirts and some flannel and jean jacket that I stocked up with patches. It made my mom happy that I didn’t choose anything she disapprove of, and I was happy because I found something that didn’t make me feel dysphoria. 

As for knowing your own truth. It’s good you know it. Take time in coming out with your therapist. And close friends. No one is putting pressure on you to rush thing. And I hope that you will be able to find yourself. I know you will, also. If you ever need to talk to anyone. You can always come talk to me, my dms are always open and I will get back to you when I can. It’s good to talk to someone about this and know you have support even if it is from the internet."
NonBinaryTalk,evnldte,t3_ckhypx,1564627170.0,"For my therapist. I finally came out. I first mention how I wanted to actual dress and how I felt good finding a style (it was a shopping trip- huge dysphoria that day) and she understood it. Then. We went on the actual session as she helped me assess my anxiety. Surprisingly. One of the things that came up was if I was anxious about being gay, it was just random and already on the paper she had. That’s when I told her.  Luckily she kept my gender confidential. 

If you do feel like he is not against anything like that. Then more than likely if he has other clients. He would have people in the closet as well. Maybe softly bringing it up? Make sure that what you say will still stay even outside. And maybe ask if he would think any differently of you when you bring up anything?

Those are such suggestions of course. But you should do what is best for you. And I am so sorry that happened to you at 14."

NonBinaryTalk,eq19etd,t3_b68jxr,1559703997.0,I think like that. But at the same time I have a constant fear of “will this make me look even more femme or masculine.” And I hate it because I want to wear what I want. But I also need to find what I am comfortable in. Yet I also need to wait until I am out of the house.
NonBinaryTalk,eq19751,t3_bc92w5,1559703862.0,"Hey. I know what you are going through. It won’t be easy. Especially trying to find who you are. There are some days where I am okay then others where I just want to curl up in bed and sleep. My family sees me as a female. When all my life I felt like “Why do I have to be female. Why can’t I chose something of the boys. Yet I am not a boy” I tried to put on make up. But it never felt right. I can wear a few necklaces and rings but only certain ones. I wear baggy shirts cause that hides my figure and who I am. 

It’s going to be frustrating. And I know that feeling of being a fraud. But. You will find yourself one day. NB or not."

I don’t know your relationship. And you may say and show affection by hugging and kissing. But sometimes that is not how he wants to show affection. 

My dad is a truck driver. He is always out on the road and home on weekends. Our relationship is different. He gets home. Get the tv and talks to me. Then we flour own thing. But he would take us places. And plan vacations. When we would get into arguments, after he cools down he would call me up and apologize but tell what I did wrong and what WE need to work on. That’s how I know he loves me

I’m not the most affectionate person. I don’t like hugs or kisses. I don’t like touch I’m sensitive to it. He understands that and let’s me hug and kiss when I want to. I make jokes with him and show affection other ways. At a distance. It looks like I don’t have a good relationship. But I would do anything for my dad. 

Now here is the thing, your son may show more physical affection to his mother. But affection in another way for you like I said. However if you want to be more involved, if your not already, then take it slow and don’t force him on doing anything he doesn’t want too. 

Like it or not. He is your son. There is no do over with another child. You’ll have another kid. But you will still have a son. And if you have another child and spend all your time with that new kid, and not bother with your son, He WILL resent you."
NonBinary,epp5qif,t3_bvbrj7,1559365031.0,I’m not out yet. But I am slowly making my nickname to come into my life. Most of my friends call me Lin due to how part of my name is pronounced with -lyn. I really don’t plan on coming out soon and that isn’t a set name. Not yet. But I got it on my high school class ring convincing my mom it was a “nickname my friends call me” so that way even if I change it. It feels like a reminder of how far I have come.
NonBinaryTalk,epp1lfw,t3_bqphkt,1559360596.0,"1. Not really. I forgot it is even there. But my boobs are the issue since I can’t forget. 
2. Like I said before. Genitalia I forget. But when I am active. I got us on the pleasure aspect of it. It’s better for me to focus on that but sometimes I am forced to stop because of my dysphoria. I actually had before wonder if I was suppose to like it when though I hated it. 
3. Yes. It’s became a habit to use the women’s bathroom because I’m not out yet (select few know) because that is what everyone sees me as. And I hate it. Especially when other people are there. I always wonder which one I should use. But always go to the female one. I keep my eyes straight ahead trying to get out of there fast.
4. I’m still on the path of being comfortable. I wish that I could just be flat chested with no genitalia at all. One of my closest friends who know of this still jokes that I should become a alien from the cartoons ever since I slipped up and said something very strange that made it seem like I was a alien impersonating a human. But it really feels like that to be honest."
