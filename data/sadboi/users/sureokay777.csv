BPD,fgpgj6c,t1_fgpfq57,1581004354.0,"I feel you. I’ve had people literally tell me to text them all the time. When I do, things get weird. The texts from them become less and less. It’s like this weird push & pull power trip that everyone is on that is utterly ridiculous. It shouldn’t be this hard to talk to people. I text a lot too! So I’d literally always warn people or ask them if they like to text. When I do they treat me like I did something wrong lol I don’t get it either. I too delete texts that I don’t want to see. If it goes on more than a day I’ll delete it. As I’m deleting the text I’m also deleting that person out of my life in my mind lol"
BPD,fgpeu45,t3_ezf64q,1581003382.0,I find that I can’t be friends with people who can’t respect me enough to keep the convo going. Like if I took the time out to text you out of the blue don’t not respond or rather respond days later! It’s rude and that to me is a tell tell sign that I shouldn’t have this person in my life. It shows that maybe they don’t care as much as I do.
BPD,fgpe9lk,t3_ezjl90,1581003048.0,It doesn’t have to be my FP though. I feel like this with almost everyone.

aquarius,fgma7bk,t3_ezc2z5,1580920791.0,I’m an Aquarius 🌞Scorpio🌛Pisces🌄. I have a hard time understanding Gemini. I usually get along with Virgo. Clash with other Aquarius. Libra get on my nerves. Cancer is hit or miss. Scorpios are amazing to me. Pisces not so much.

BPD,fglvr9h,t3_ez9z4z,1580912107.0,I feel you. I go through this a lot. I’ve often times thought it was me or something I did to make people not want me the way I wanted them. It doesn’t feel good.
sad,fglu71w,t3_ez3noo,1580911031.0,☺️
BPD,fglt3vh,t3_eyuypw,1580910282.0,"This literally just happened to me. I opened up to a coworker as well and mistook them for a friend. It took me 6 months to realize they were just trying to use me. I kept thinking oh, maybe it’s me, maybe they’re having a bad day. Maybe they just don’t want to talk, maybe I’m too much, maybe they just don’t want to hang out etc. They’d reeled me into thinking I could trust them and also get vulnerable just to become cold and distant. I’ve learned a lesson, but it doesn’t hurt any less."
