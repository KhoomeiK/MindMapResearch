And it got to the point where I was coming in late every day because 1) I was too poor and fed up to care and 2) we basically stayed late every day. The difference was, I couldn’t get a second job because I had no idea when I’d be getting out of there on a given day. My boss, rather than intervene and hear me out, decided to fire me. My mental health went from bad to worse, my girlfriend broke up with me, and I bottomed out. That response from your boss, like you said, sounds like total bullshit.
