I did not use it as the ONLY treatment, it was a supplement one. What I’m trying to say is that there is no harm in supplementing alternative medicine. 

I believe in using both conventional and alternative medicine. I do not believe in ONLY using alternative medicine. 

I believe it’s ignorant to say that just because I believe in alternative medicine, i do not believe in conventional medicine. 

Also, when conventional medicine can not longer provide relief, is it so bad to try other methods?"

They will give a steroid to deal with the immediate  effects of the flare, prescription pain relief, but also give some natural supplementation. Ie. tonics, acupuncture etc. 

The goal is to deal with the immediate flare and pain ASAP, but also use PREVENTATIVE measures  as supplementation, so that the dog hopefully doesn’t need to take steroids in the long term."

We cannot say it’s just because of alcohol and smoking....sure it plays a small part. But doctors believe the rise is due to the salted food used in fermenting and in smoking/ preserving foods.

Honestly, depending on the type of cancer of stomach cancer he had you will be able to deduce what were the main factors. But usually for anyone under 35 it’s usually a diffused type (aggressive) and only 10% of stomach cancer cases are diffused."

Even though most people after stomach cancer would not need to get colonoscopies this often, ive been advised to do it every 6 months because I always seem to grow polyps. The precancerous type. 

I’m sure it’s not diet or lifestyle related cause I eat very clean and very rarely do I eat processed foods. 

Ive never had anxiety about any of my procedures. (I also get an endoscopy every 3 months so they can perform a balloon dilation). 
I think I was able to get through cancer mentally (eventually) was because I realised that cancer or any type of disease or illness just happens sometimes! It’s not within our control. We can be the healthiest person, but still get it. So I’ve just accepted life for what it is. 

Sometimes when I’m going through periods of bowel pain, I do wonder if the cancer is back. They will order scans, but I’m quite calm about it.

I’m 34 now. I was one of those people who thought it would be easier to be diagnosed with cancer and die that way. This way it’s easier for society to accept. Before I was diagnosed with stomach cancer, I was actually in a really good place mentally. I hadn’t been hospitalised in a while and slowly starting to decrease some of my meds. 

Honestly, having cancer was tough. Both surgeries were very hard on my body. I’m still dealing with the side effects of the surgery and treatment and most likely will for the rest of my life.

I lucked out with Lulu, she was very easy to toilet train and was not destructive. 

I’ve never been an active person, so I needed someone who napped as much as I did and was a couch potato. She was the perfect couch potato. She was my best friend and my soul mate. 

It was when I got Lulu, that made me work really hard towards being my own mental health advocate. If I had a mania or depressive cycle and needed to be hospitalized, I would miss her so much that I really would try my absolute best to just keep going. As time went by and I got better at recognizing triggers and possible signs, the episodes got better and better. I started looking forward to the future and the things we could do together.

Hypoglycemia,ewqg75a,t1_ewoksq5,1565665097.0,"What’s your diazoxide dosage? 
It wasn’t till I was on this medication that my baseline hypos got better and I was able to do the keto diet. Sticking to this diet has really helped with those blood sugar swings. I eat 5 meals a day and stick to under 50g carbs a day. Never eat any carbs alone, always paired with fats. 

For me, when I have a severe hypo episode and need the 15g of sugar ASAP. I will drink 100ml orange juice followed with a tablespoon of MCT oil. As soon as I’m able to think and I’m not sweating and nearly fainting I start loading up on protein and fats 

I’ve also incorporated a tablespoon of MCT oil before bed and helps with my night hypos."

Dryeyes,ewhv354,t3_co78uy,1565423918.0,"I’m currently going through the same thing (Australia). So now I switch between hyloforte and the individual drops. 

I’ve been able to cut down on the drops by making sure I stick to this routine: 

1. Heat pack at least once a day and do eyelid massage
2. Clean eyelid margins with approved wipes 3 x a day 
3. Manuka honey drops 3 x a day after eyelid margin clean
4. Manuka honey gel on lid margin 2x a day
5. Hyloforte drops after all the above and whenever needed
6. Lipid spray or drops 3 x a day after hyloforte."
