therapy,fqlk0jj,t3_gjjm01,1589460076.0,"Umm, I'm not experienced to say you need it or not but ya know, if you are not enjoying your life to full extent, I think you need it. You want to change it, right? So, don't sweat it. Sometimes, Life is simple. We just kinda overthink it and make things confused. So, ask yourself if you are enjoying your life the way you want to be. If not, if you want to change, then go ahead. Live your life to fullest extent. Hope you to be happy a lot, and enjoy your life a lot. Sorry that I can't give you the decisive answer. I'm not experienced enough."

I really appreciate your kindness.After several attempts to get rid of these feelings, which is not successful,I 'm now convinced that I have to believe that I can overcome that sort of thing even it is futile.
