I thank you for putting in the work to be better than yourself, as this will have an impact on the world for generations to come. 

I also wonder about this. What would we understand about life itself here on Earth if we didnt puss out at every corner painted red? How would we advance if we put as much money into the brain industry as we currently are the space industry? Who at this point in time would try to control the research and limit publicity of the findings?????

Earth is unhealthy right now, not just humanity. I think she will be taking care of us soon to come, but not without our brutal will to survive being tested. She did not put us here to coast through life therefore she will not allow us to coast through her reset period. If you don’t fight to survive during our future then you won’t survive. It is definitely brutal, and jagged. 

It does not warm me to ponder the potential of slaying a thief attempting to kill me and my cat just so I can continue living off of rice and chicken broth for the next 9 months. Great Depressions aren’t fucking cool, and neither is our planet. We’re already up a little more than .5°C since 1850. That is extremely extremely rapid, and the weather is speaking its truth. 

Constant wind, crazy weather fluctuations, snow when the suns out and summer in february. It’s not making any sense. 

I know it all seems unrelated but.... You’re mothering an aspect to Our Humanity. He will eventually be 20, and the year will eventually be 2050. Our future has always loomed over our heads, and ever since the year -19 have I u/sametember been destined to create this message. 

My point is that I think we really need to take a long and hard think about what our futures might be looking like in the next five years. I’m not so sure that the best case scenario will yield exactly *safe*.... results...... Especially not when more than half of the people are dumber than your average idiot. Things are gonna get worse before they get better and I just ask of you to hold onto your love. If not for you then your son. I am 18 and have been through life to this point with no accessible role models. My parents failed themselves many years ago and have never recovered, and our children will always know a situation like this. They might not understand it, or articulate it to themselves, but they feel it. They know when things aren’t quite right and develop mechanisms in response before we even understand them. 

And that’s why people ravage us abused folk. They don’t like what they don’t understand, and someone like me lives as an amalgamation of self defense mechanisms until they step up and do something good for themselves. 

There is always hope, not not always a hand to hold onto it. Keep up your hard work mom, we as a species deserve it."
Anger,fqqfs4a,t1_fqncux6,1589564761.0,"I understand this. I hope it helps you feel like you belong to know that no humans including myself likes to feel inferior. I don’t like it and especially when they start trying to rub it in. That is our ego, our personality, our physical body reacting to what’s around it. Those reactions are known as emotions. 

Those other people that are always one-upping you are even more caught up in their ego than you are. You at least realize there are issues. You acknowledge that *inferior* is a *feeling* and not a truth. You acknowledge that you don’t want to continue living this way. That takes a certain level of strength already that a lot of people will never attain in their lifetime. 

So with people like you mentioned here, it simply isn’t wise to wait on them becoming normal again. They definitely aren’t going to upend their beliefs on reality and emotions just because some other dude gets pissed off when they act their bullshit. They are definitely holding you down and making it much more difficult to process your own anger. 

Hence the root of the issue. As tough as it is you’re the only one causing your pain. Think of it this way, if you thought U V and W was funny then it would only be X Y and Z that pissed you off. And vice versa. Everyone has anger and anger changes your thinking. You’re much less likely to donate to a homeless man if you just lost your job, even if you have 500k in the bank, even if you’re known for it. Anger tricks you and fools you. Changes what you believe when you’re feeling it.

If you don’t think so then pull out a piece of paper and recall the last time you were angry, without any swearing on the page. Try and write it so that your grandmother could understand why you felt that way. I guarantee you if you actually try this you will wind up surprised by the result. It won’t be what you think it will be, and maybe it might even help you. 

But even if it doesn’t help, it will show you something about how you feel anger. It will show you how different you see life when you’re angry vs. say staring at yourself in the mirror. This technique also gives you some agency over how you feel and creates relics for you to look back on to evaluate and check progress. 

You also have two choices. You either read this or you don’t. I would enjoy it if you read this but if you don’t, at the end of the day I now have this to look back on. If this just pisses you off today then at least you can be pissed off about me helping myself. 

Helping myself because this is my advice. If this is what I think might be helpful for you then obviously I have some experience with this sort of thing. Anger might be my brains favorite emotion besides Void. Not a pretty existence whatsoever, but you make do.

And i’ve made do by writing how I see the world and my thoughts within it. Everything works just better for certain people. You have to find what works for you. Peace brother Feel free to reach out now or in 3 months. I feel for my fellow rage freaks"

I’m not sure your mom can help your sister directly seeing as she simply allowed time to take away her flashy rage. Clearly it’s genetic as now your sister is out of control. Your mom isn’t doing anything proactive about it so it’s just getting worse very quickly. 

And you have been traumatized out of your anger. So..... I really don’t know. Sounds like a dead end situation to me that you definitely don’t deserve to be in. That’s the type of shit that gives you a heart attack by 35.

Anger,fqqd2oi,t3_gk7gln,1589563431.0,"I’m not sure either gonna be honest with you lol. Repetitive beeping is one of my least favorite things ever and yes it gets me very angry after a while. I’m to the point where it fluctuates where some days the first beep pisses me off and others it’s the 70th beep, but yeah. 

I live in an area where basically by the time the concrete won’t drop below 52° F anymore the Traffic Cone is allowed full bloom. Fucking greedy fucks can’t stay away from their flashy new architecture, so they spend hundreds of thousands of dollars every 5 years time just to raise appeal. But they do this without giving a shit about the general livability of the worse off neighborhoods, creating an extreme demographic divide.

Every summer it’s constant construction every day. Sometimes they even start 30 minutes before the legal second where the 70db limit can be passed, waking me at 6:30 in the morning.

Combine that with backhoes smashing on the ground knocking shit off the shelves sometimes, it’s pretty hard not to seethe."

Anger,fqqc88f,t1_fp6x14i,1589563017.0,"Sounds like you got an anger problem and a household problem. Those are completely normal triggers that you’ve posted, and honestly all of those ALL OF THOSE also enrages me. Also to the point of violence. Violence against myself violence against my objects. 

It’s unbelievable how fast it can flare up in my face.

It also sounds like you are being psychologically manipulated to the Dark Side. Not the sith but of darkness. Presumedly this is your parents or family members treating your perceptions like this. It sounds like they brush them away and deflect their weight with extremely unrelated bullshit, that probably only ties into the current issue because it, too, is an issue. 

Shit is maddening, and will screw your head on backwards after a while. Your energy shield is not strong enough to go cold turkey from being impacted by their words. You can’t just step away for a few days and armor yourself up. It takes a lot of willpower to personally dismiss these things they are saying to you, especially when you were programmed and taught to believe that their behaviors are standard and The Way. If you can’t escape this situation within the next month then I’m afraid you are going to have to take drastic measures.

You gotta get their words out of your head for a while. Treat them so blandly that the only thing they could possibly assume is that you’ve had a stroke and lost your entire personality. Be so boring when you speak that all of a sudden you’re  now the psychological manifestation of what they want you to be; a punching bag. 

Boring seems weak and it will just make them pick on you more, which is exactly the point. If these people are truly sick and mentally unhealthy then this new Stone Wall technique will enrage them. It means they feel entitled to your attention, and by being boring it communicates to them that you are unwilling to engage your personality with them. 

Hence, boring.

I don’t have the answers but I have the anger. Ive been abused in sly ways like this that don’t even immediately register as soul crushing. It’s a passive stream of daily digs and daily remarks and daily glances and daily body language cues. It’s daily. 

And nothing you ever say will wake them up.

If they’re gonna wake up then it’s on their own terms due to gross amounts of regret and shame. Perhaps even then they will just open their eyes into reality and shoot right back into their shell and become even worse. 

Most idiots don’t change"
Ingrown_Toenails,fqqa74w,t3_fen1xl,1589562023.0,"Ive had a lot of ingrown toenail issues. Sooooooooo bad so so bad I hate it and I cringed when I saw this. Those are pretty far gone man. 

What worked for me was looking at my toes every single day. After I finally got the two corner spikes out of my flesh I dulled the tips and did not cut it anymore. I used a file to make it not so thorn like and every day used a toothpick or paper clip or file or anything like that to physically bend my toenails away from the corner.

Once I felt satisfied with the near removal of my toenails, I left the toothpick shard under the nail for a little while. I wanted them trained so they wouldn’t continuously burrow into my flesh.

After a few weeks it was long enough to continue training without stress. I trimmed it one last time and continued the bending strategy. Then I let my big toe nails get like 5mm long lol. I was so scared of it ever happening again. 

Now i’m in that boat again. Too much anxiety to allow my nails to grow, so I’ve been cutting them as short as they’ll go and dealing with the reality that I will have to continue to train them back out of the corner.

The training strategy really works. Just bend them about as far as they will go in the opposite direction of your toe and stop when it hurts too much. You don’t want to damage them but you also must realize how strong nails really are. 

I hope any of this is helpful"
Anger,fqq8zom,t3_gk86a5,1589561440.0,"I understand the loss of respect. Even though these lapses of restraint are in fact a dishonor to yourself, it felt unavoidable. 

Anger so strong that you feel like you need to physically act it out or else it physically pains you is scary stuff and there really isn’t an effective way to stop it. It will always hurt and you will always feel like a weak fucking rat because your puny fist can only stand up against so much sundried dirt. (drywall) 

But you’re not wrong. You’re not stupid, and you aren’t barbaric. Anger is a biological emotion that doesn’t just happen to humans. Tell a dog they can’t ingest your 70,000 bank check and they’ll start fucking snapping at you. It’s just life. I don’t have the answers but I have the anger, and I understand the pain it brings.

I didn’t want to assume wrong and get my hopes down so I was kind of slow about calling him Robert but he sounded JUST LIKE HIM!! And then I put 2*2 together! 

He even shook my hand!!!! I didn’t even think to get a picture with him I was just enamored with his presence. I don’t care if he’s a web developer he’s part of the sound and he’s seen it all happen. He’s just as important to me as the rest of them are.

And it does not appear that nature is pleased.

Look at it this way: After years and years of destroying her surface for our own means, we finally manage to invent the internet with her resources. 

Realistically, the internet has little practical use to us. It’s only once the humans on the other side of the electric signals modify their specifics that we’re given something we can interpret.

Which means we’ve had all this time to talk to eachother and communicate issues and plans of attack. But we didn’t. We never have. We just waste our fucking lives away with this shit, mindless and drooling, continuously changing the color of our soil, sea, and souls from their original pine green to a grotesque, mutated shade of void.

And Earth isn’t happy about it. She knows her power and she’s showing us what’s up.

At least for New England of America, we’ve always been known for psychotic weather. -5 F in winters and 90 in the summers, both of which appearing to just kinda turn on. Like one week will be freezing then it’ll be like spring and it will just never go back. 

But this year in particular has been very different, even in the face of the climate change. It seems like we didn’t even have a winter, the freeze never dipping below 25 and already in March we’re having 60 degree days. That’s totally unheard of! 

But now it’s going to snow multiple times over the next week, 2 small storms already having hit us the past 7 days.

It’s almost like the Earth wanted to make us think we’d have it easy this winter, giving us a break with all the snow. But it’s true; there’s always silence before the storm, and now in lieu of everyone’s laziness and resent towards the **natural happenings of this planet**, we were given a special strain of COVID, a week or two of beautiful weather, and now we’re here at March 24 2020 with 5 inches of snow on the ground and  perhaps the worst year to come since the Age of The Great Depression.

Check out [Paul Stamets](fungi.com) and some of the work he has done.

He has done two podcasts with Joe Rogan and more than one TED talk and I feel like that’s a great place to start.

He’s a competent and credible scientist with 5 books authored and 8 patents created, one of which is a fungal pesticide that is completely natural and safe for the environment.

Check him out!"

According to the article, mushrooms are only the sex organs of the massive organism that lies beneath called Mycelium.

Mycelium is a fibrous network of spores that resemble the neurons in our brain and connect together to support the ecosystem and promote the health of all sorts of organisms.

Many species produce antibacterial, anti-insect, and even animal-repelling chemicals that are released into the host in turn for a safe place to live and reproduce. Fascinating stuff!"

How long have you been with this fellow? The honeymoon phase can sometimes last over a year, two years. It can get crazy. 

You're not wrong for enjoying this so much. Often do I find myself as well wishing for the pleasantries of a romance. Often do I also find myself ignoring the real work and challenges that come with balancing out the lives of two individuals who have made the choice to become One.

It's a very tricky process, and I agree with him, you're feeling the rush of oxytocin coursing throughout your body like there's a factory pumping it out within.

Considering you're likely younger than 25, I don't think you're going to ruin your life by cuddling with your boyfriend. But I do think you can quickly become far too used to the feeling of comfort and security. I think it's a slippery slope, and I would urge you to be careful with how much of yourself you identify with your boyfriend.

Sit down, take a notebook or a sticky note or a note document online and make a list. Make a list of all the things in this world you love. List the things you like to do, see, hear, touch, smell, feel. Emotions you enjoy. List things you're afraid of. See how many of these you can rack up without involving your mans into it. 

Not saying he's bad to involve, but the post-write should be focused on you and not him. There's no wrong answers to the list!!"
