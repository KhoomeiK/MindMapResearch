There’s nothing wrong with wanting to achieve more in life and pushing yourself but you will never find true happiness in comparing yourself to others. Once you have found a way to be content with what you have and where you’re at, then you can probably resume using social media because you’ll feel unaffected by what others are achieving because you will be so focused on your achievements.
Personally the times Ive been happiest since childhood have been when I’ve deleted my social media and focused on my self growth and thought about purely what I want to do and what makes me happy. ❤️"
