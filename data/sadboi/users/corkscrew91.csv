atheism,foii06o,t3_g6rxte,1587787125.0,"One time at Southern Baptist school, I was on the playground when my teacher came over to me FURIOUS.  She physically pulled me down from the monkey bars and scolded me, saying that I heard her yelling and CHOSE to ignore her. I said no, I didn't hear her. She was livid, absolutely livid and insisted that I was purposefully ignoring her. We went to the principal's office that day. I remember denying it and denying it and then it was five adults (my two parents, my teacher, the principal, and the vice principal) all in a room with me telling me they knew I was lying. that lying is a sin. That I needed to just tell them. Do the right thing just tell them that I lied. IT LASTED HOURS. So I did what any sane human would do in a room full of INsane people, I told them what they wanted to hear. That I lied. Which was not true but it had been hours and I wanted to end the torture. The principal and my dad discussed which one of them would be paddling me. They got out a wooden paddle with red tape wrapped around it and holes drilled in it and it was painful as fuck. And I walked out of there hurt physically, mentally and emotionally, thinking maybe I had heard her yelling for me? Maybe I had just WANTED to ignore her, and I just didn't remember..... because I have sin in my heart. I was a terrible person and needed a lot of help from Jesus or someone.... I felt so confused that I imagined this situation could happen again at any moment, at any point in time... I was 9."

atheism,foigqrl,t3_g6rxte,1587786260.0,"I'm watching it right now, 15 min in.....I needed to find sane ppl on the internet. I'm so triggered. I spent my whole childhood in this madness. 

I said and did things I didn't mean or believe or want to do. I was gaslighted and hurt and learned to hate myself and not trust myself and hate other people... So much guilt and shame and I've lived my whole adult life trying to undo it and trust my brain again ........... and it feels impossible. I'm crying :( legit terrified by seeing this on my TV so up-close. I ran away and never looked back until now, it's .... I'm horrified for these kids and seeing this BLATANT psychological torture and abuse feels so wrong."
