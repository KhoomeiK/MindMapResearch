America doesn’t have mask culture, so masks are thought to look scary (N95 type things) or goofy (cloth masks, surgical masks). But even a simple cloth face covering does a lot to protect you and other people from coronavirus. When 80 to 90% of the population is wearing face coverings, transmission of the virus drops dramatically. That fact makes me feel a lot safer, not anxious.  

Wear your mask, and be secure in the fact that you were doing the socially responsible thing."

I’m sure you’ve seen them – proper handwashing techniques, the importance of airing out your house, how to exercise if you’re older and staying in the house. 

One was about using masks, and they specifically said not to bother using masks with young children. I’ve always thought the same thing because I have children, and when they were very young it was impossible to get them to wear a mask properly. 

I agree elementary school kids can wear masks properly, but you’re still fighting an uphill battle telling them not to touch it or wear it over their nose and down to their chin. Just look around – even adults have a hard time with that. 

I want to see everybody wearing masks too. But it’s not a substitute for social distancing and just staying at home."

PornFreeRelationships,fghce8b,t3_eyevg6,1580781704.0,"I’d be really interested to know how your partner’s porn use mirrored/followed their “transition”. In my experience, the online mtf space is *very* porn focused and misogynistic (sissyhypno porn, bimbofication, etc). Even the standard trope of having to become more “femme“ in order to identify as a woman feeds into the same ideas that make porn such a problem. 

With that being said, 0P, you also described really abusive behavior. You’re trying to bring your concerns to your partner in an honest and loving manner and they are shutting you down and gaslighting you. They are even scrolling through porn with you sitting next to them. That’s gross, disrespectful and shows they have a problem. 

Even if this wasn’t about porn, the fact that your partner can’t have an adult conversation about something that bothers you is a huge red flag. The fact that it is porn makes it even grosser and potentially unsafe. 

You’ve already tried to have a conversation with your partner, and they showed that they’re not willing to listen. You don’t need to keep knocking on the same door. Porn is clearly more important to them than you are; you already kind of know it in your gut. Cut ties now before you get in any deeper and find a partner who’s not porn sick."
