I’ve been testing this on a set of eight beta learners and we call the resource ‘The Library’. During a coaching session, each learner can duplicate a relevant section of the library, enabling each learner to build their own curriculum.

I have a vision that I could use this as the basis of a design- and business-focused teaching community (outside of Belfast School of Art), but I’m struggling to find a way to build a paid membership community around this.

If I invited all the learners to join my team, so I could make the library private, I’d have to pay $8 per member per month. That would wipe out the membership fees I’d planed on charging, or push the price up and put it beyond the reach of many.

If Notion makes an API available, would I be able to wrap a membership layer around the library? (Sorry, I’m non-technical!)

This is a non-university project, i.e. my learners wouldn’t count as students (free) in Notion’s eyes. I feel like I’m close to a solution, but the membership system seems out of reach."

I couldn’t allow myself to entertain the thought that I might be calling it quits forever – as far as alcohol was concerned – so I settled on the goal of ‘A Year, Probably More, Off Alcohol’.

I remember the beginning of the journey and it was a challenge. Instead of thinking of the vastness of time stretching out ahead, I broke the time down into smaller milestones. This might sound ridiculous, but it helped me hugely.

I made up all sorts of crazy mini milestones just to keep myself focused:

+ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 days…
+ 1 week…
+ 10 days, double digits…
+ 11 (the first double digit prime number!)…
+ 12, a dozen…
+ 13, a bakers’ dozen…
+ 2 weeks…
+ …
