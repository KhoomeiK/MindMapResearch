Like I didn't know I'm less of a queer person because it took me longer in life to figure/come out. Guess I had to be out by high school to be a real Bisexual woman. 

Tldr: like whatever bits ya do. I just find it problematic how you're talking down about Trans people. Like that they're the weird ones that don't make sense."
