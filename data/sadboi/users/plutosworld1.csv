My story is extreme, which is actually why I came here- anonymity and advice to get through it. I am truly spending my day blacking names out and uploading docs to scribd to share for my credibility’s sake. It’s not as much about caring about internet stranger’s opinions, but about credibility so I can use this site for what I came to use it for. I think this is a phenomenal place for people to get support and advice for personal things they just can’t go other places for. It is a valuable resource for a lot of reasons- from being at rock bottom and needing objective, non-professional  feedback (therapists cannot legally give advice and must report you if you are having certain thoughts) to simply having a fun place to find like-minded hobbyists. 

I’m not trying to be a comment hog and obligate you to keep responding. I got downvoted on this post that we are commenting on, so after my experience here so far I feel compelled to explain where I’m coming from. If I make a new account I will still have the same story, and then I really will seem like a troll when I post identical things to this account.

If you are close to your cousin this is what I would do: I would spend some time with her alone doing something fun and girly. I would wait until we were comfortably talking about things... like maybe a boy she likes at school. 

I would give her the big sister talk about what not to let a boy do (assuming she is hanging out with boys and having boyfriends at all), and then I would simply ask her if she has ever done “anything”. How I would word it would depend on the conversation and her knowledge of things and maturity level. I would then ask her if anyone at all has has done anything to her. 

I don’t know your bond with her or how she would feel discussing this with you, but given her age it’s worth a shot. Ease into it. Build trust. And whatever you do, unless she gives you information of abuse, don’t break that trust."

SexWorkers,fdfbr4x,t1_fdf8nlh,1578357951.0,"I literally explained this in my previous reply, but I will paste it here again:


“False promises is more of a process.. I didn’t write the law, and I don’t know any willing sex workers who are working in the sex trade because a man came into their life with the successful intention of lying, abusing, and manipulating them into prostitution- convincing them that the real prize was on the other side. Those “sex workers” are under the influence of a trafficker.”

I am not the one focusing on false promises. You literally focused on it and compared it to a Toyota sale. I replied to you. You are still focusing on it and ended your response asking what I think false promises is that is sex trafficking. What I think is really unimportant, but according to the definition.... I’ll paste it again:


“False promises is more of a process.. I didn’t write the law, and I don’t know any willing sex workers who are working in the sex trade because a man came into their life with the successful intention of lying, abusing, and manipulating them into prostitution- convincing them that the real prize was on the other side. Those “sex workers” are under the influence of a trafficker.”

The sentence where I wrote “I don’t know of any sex workers who are working....” I was using the term “sex worker” to describe a willing and consenting escort. I should have clarified that in my response. Someone being sex trafficked is not a sex worker because the difference is consent. Sex trafficking, by law, means that consent is absent. Sex trafficking is not sex work. 

“False” and “promises” is not confusing at all. The legal term is “deception”. “Fraud” can apply as well. 

Make up any interpretation you like. Your argument is shallow and confusing and you are complicating things that are actually quite simple."
SexWorkers,fdf77ko,t1_fdf5kye,1578354902.0,"I have no strategy. No, trafficking is not telling “some girl she could make a lot of money to sleep with his friends.” Nowhere in this thread or in the law... or anywhere else does it say that.

False promises is more of a process..

Nothing to do with being scammed. 

Being able to come and go freely does not mean it isn’t trafficking. People still want to argue this when the law is right in front of them. You have gone in so many circles in your arguments with me, putting words in my mouth, arguing off-topics subjects, and making analogies that don’t apply, that I really don’t know what else to say.
