AskReddit,ez35k1t,t3_cytl6a,1567661328.0,"well not really the best thing in life, but best thing before graduating high school. here's some context, i live in bali, every march 2nd or the 3rd week there's a balinese tradition where the entire bali island needs to shut off their lights call nyepi (silent day), and not allowed to go out your houose, or not police in that area will throw rocks at you. (except hospitals, fire departments and police station), it's basically balinese culture that everyone needs to respect, no matter what religion you are, it's basically new year for them (starry night is very beautiful btw). 

so me and the boys we rent a villa in some area and bought some drinks the day before, we played never have i ever, then soon after we got bored. then one of my friends suggested we should play truth or dare, but instead of the traditional game, we take turn say a dare and everyone have to do that dare together, we got so drunk and bored, the next thing you knew was 8 boys in boxers quietly ran out, we all count to 3, then we all took off our boxers and ran around the neighbourhood, it was pitchblack, damn scary but so damn hilarious and definetly one of the best memories i had in years.
