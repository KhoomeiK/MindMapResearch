depression,fal6ip0,t1_fajgyob,1576179228.0,"Geez, same here. From about 10 to my mid twenties was heavily filled with abusers (I was kind of weird and had severe ADHD which can manifest other disorders you might not expect). I’m 29 now and, while I have the occasional suicidal ideation, I’m no longer actively suicidal. After awhile I stopped going out with friends and started isolating a little which turned into a lot which turned into completely isolated not even talking to people online and avoiding even texting. A couple years ago I started therapy but it didn’t really help for a long time; a combination of weed and finding the right therapist helped more than anything in my life. I’ve started reaching out here and there but it’s like I just don’t know how to connect with them anymore. With my high executive dysfunction I can’t have a job or support myself so I’m miles behind my peers and it’s not like I can get that time back or play a good game of catch up Bc I can barely exist as is. I love that you called it “awkwardly existential” Bc that perfectly captures the unease it seems to cause in others. I’m 29 and I didn’t plan to live to 25 let alone 30 and idk what to do with myself."
depression,fal40rk,t3_e9hksr,1576178026.0,The primary emotions I feel from that stagnation are shame and hopelessness.
depression,fa8d3yh,t1_f9vhg26,1575844629.0,"Try every other day at first and remember not to be worried if she doesn’t reply.  I feel like it’s nice to get silly random texts, it tells me they’re thinking about me without me having obligations to have a conversation that I don’t have the energy for. Of course that being said, if she expresses discomfort at it then obviously stop doing it Bc that just defeats the point 🤷🏻‍♀️"
depression,f9vg5q8,t3_e74xds,1575669726.0,"The feeling of “not able to be around human beings” often stems from the fact that humans are very critical in our interactions. There are so many invisible hoops we have to jump through and performances to put on while even just talking that the energy it takes is more than many depressed people can muster. 

One thing that really helped me was my boyfriend telling me that it’s my choice if I want to go to therapy but, if I did, he would make it happen. I guess the feeling of having the option rather than being pressured into it made it feel less heavy. 

To be a good friend, though, is easy enough. Send her things you think are funny that she’ll think is funny. When you think of her, send her whatever is on your mind even tiny things like “I’m deciding if I want coffee or soda”. Especially tiny things! (But not so many as to overwhelm her if she’s not being very conversational that day, you want her to feel like part of your life not like you’re a looming obligation she’s ritualistically letting down).  Be prepared for her to forget things and cancel plans, depression often comes with a mental fog similar to what you get if you have a bad long lasting migraine. Treat her like your friend who is sick minus the soups and medicines."

depression,f873xl0,t1_f87384z,1574315164.0,"It varies from person to person but you kind of need to figure out what you’re looking for. When you start, all you really know is that you need help and you’re seeking it. It took me a bit to realize what I needed was to feel heard and seen; I didn’t want to be a patient talking to a doctor, I wanted to be a person talking to an educated person. For my current therapist, I checked online reviews and found one that took my insurance and the only negative reviews people had were things I was completely fine with. You’ll find someone that you click with but it takes time. Just know that it’s ok not to know what you need yet."
depression,f8738yq,t3_dzec68,1574314488.0,"People have a hard time sympathizing with things they can’t understand and, unfortunately, many don’t understand mental illnesses unless they experience them. My only advice would be to try and find scholarly resources on depression (scholarly Bc they’re less likely to go ignored) and hope she’s open to the information that way maybe she won’t only be accepting of popular media symptoms. My mother has trouble with this as well. That being said, if she refuses to try to understand what you’re going through, you can’t force her and trying wouldn’t be worth the effort. I wish you the best of luck."
depression,f872ojo,t3_dzeerx,1574313966.0,"Finding the right therapist is a process, the first one isn’t necessarily going to be the right one (it could be but rarely is). Just tell her “that wasn’t the right therapist for me, I need to try again”. I’m proud of you for recognizing the dark place you’re at and for wanting to seek help. It was my third therapist that really helped me, I hope for you that it’s your second."

depression,er2w6s4,t3_c094hx,1560450958.0,"Well first of all you need to communicate that the insulting isn’t helping. You can’t heal well if you’re continuously being wounded. Pushing her away Bc you’re sick isn’t going to help either of you, she’s in the relationship Bc she wants to be, most likely, and dumping her seems like it disregards her feelings. I think about leaving my partner every couple of weeks Bc of depression, don’t let it sabotage those life lines!"

depression,eof9coo,t3_brm1uj,1558527637.0,Make a list of things you used to be interested or maybe still are and devote 3 weeks to each thing (longer if you find yourself enjoying it again). Then either follow something that caught your interest or at the very least you found you had a knack for.
depression,eof6792,t3_brn5sh,1558524205.0,"Try deviating from that schedule. Make a list of different things to do and roll a die. Do whatever number it lands on (or the one you were hoping it would land on if you find there is one). Maybe it’ll help, maybe it won’t but at least you tried."
