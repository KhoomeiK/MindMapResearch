My response;

“Hardest task since Churchill? Hardly. Rebuilding after the Second World War. Cuban Missile Crisis.   Hyperinflation and economic stagnation. HIV pandemic. All these events and more besides, have taxed various Prime Ministers since Churchill.

He has lied about the effects of Brexit. Making promises he knew were impossible to keep. £350m per week extra for the NHS? 

Yes. He had COVID-19. But also had access to testing (when front line workers did not). He didn’t come “straight back to work”.

He hasn’t given away anything. That “£12 billion” is raised from taxation.  That’s public money. Not out of his own pocket.

He might as well be taking pat leave. It’s not like he is visible or leading the Government’s response. The PM isn’t a key worker - not in the way most people would understand that term.

Boris Johnson cares only about Boris Johnson. He cares little for the country. He has claimed Russian interference in UK democratic processes. Yet now claims to the contrary and refuses to release the Russia Report. If you think he is extolling support for British culture, then you must support his racism, homophobia too.

People are “moaning” because they see a man Utterly unfit for any public office, who goes missing when a PM should be visible, is incapable of telling the truth. Who has been part of a government that has stripped public services of funding and voted against pay rises for NHS staff in 2017. And then cheered at doing so.

britisharmy,fj9f6mh,t3_fc3jpc,1583145753.0,"Depends on how you want to frame the word “secretive”. 

UKSF (of which the SAS is a part of) make use of novel tactics, training and operational skills, that are classified for very obvious reasons of both PERSEC and OPSEC. 

As you might expect their operational taskings are usually highly sensitive and any leaking of deployments and objectives could jeopardise this. As has been statement in a previous reply. UKSF do work very closely with the security services. As well as maintaining strong relationships with other allied SF forces (Think Delta and SEALs, Australian and NZ SAS, etc). 

This is why HMG will never comment on UKSF numbers, roles, training and operational deployments. And why UKSF adopt relaxed dress standards. You may wish to note that the SBS’ old motto was “not by strength by guile” (now; by strength and guile). 

For observers UKSF wings worn on dress uniforms indicate that the wearer is/has served in UKSF.

The MOD, some years ago made former UKSF personnel, planning on writing about their experiences submit any books for screening and approval so as not to reveal any information which might confer an advantage to any current of future adversary in terms of understanding their operational tactics.

Former members are under no standing regulations or requirements not to reveal their service once they have left, only not to reveal their operational deployments and taskings. 

As an aside; anyone who has ever signed the OSA is legally bound by that legislation until they pop off the mortal coil. It is however a bit of an anticlimax - it’s just a piece of paper you sign. 

Terms used;

UKSF - United Kingdom Special Forces.
PERSEC - Personal Security
OPSEC - Operational Security
SBS - Shaky Boats*
SAS - Stores and Supplies**
OSA - Official Secret Act.
MoD - Ministry of Defects***
