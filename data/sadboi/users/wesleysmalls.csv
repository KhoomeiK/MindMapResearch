If you ask me that sounds like you don’t want it to change. Having depression is one thing, but there are so many types of therapy, medications and tools to deal with depression that a ‘bit I’m depressed’ is hardly ever a valid argument against something.

1. Humans are able to plan ahead and thus will make sure they charge their device beforehand or bring a powerbank with them.
2. Why would you go out into the nature and then just use your device the whole time?

>I want that super ultra thin phone. But I'm going to carry around a power bank because the battery is too small. Makes perfect sense.

Why wouldn't it be? It's a solution to a problem people rarely face.

>You chose cars to form an analogy with batteries in phones and then chose offroading ability? It's called a gas tank. That is the direct comparable trait between those two classes of product. 

Doesn't matter what part I use for the analogy. The point was very clear; if it isn't a requirement people won't take that part into consideration. For example if people don't need a long battery life they won't take this into consideration for their next device.

>Having a phone not run out of battery life for the usable life of the phone is not a requirement. It's basic functionality.

People's obsession with battery life is something I have never got. Getting into a situation where you won't be able to charge your device is a rarity, and even then you have solutions like a powerbank.

The comparison is like asking if you choose a Maserati or a land Rover, informing them that the Maserati isn't very good off road. If it isn't a requirement for them, why should that be a priority? For the majority of people it isn't a issue if they need to charge their device throughout the day, so the bigger battery isn't a requirement.
