Stop fucking worrying about it. If you are so insecure as to make masturbation some kind of dirty addiction in your mind like it’s heroin or something, then you have an unhealthy relationship to your own body and your own sexuality. 

Work on that. Unless your masturbation is preventing you from going out and living your life or if you’re some kind of porn addict who can’t stop looking at it for hours every day, then you’re just a normal guy who has a wank every day or two. It’s nothing to be depressed about. If your brain is messed up that badly over it then trying to force yourself not to masturbate EVER is just going to make you repressed and sad.

Your brain processes them in similar ways, even though the panic attack was only psychologically traumatic."
SingleDads,fgh9uv9,t3_ey9ytp,1580780048.0,"I love having my kids but also love my alone time when they’re at their mom’s house. I guess some people are wired for solitude. When I have the house to myself is when I catch up on my hobbies, get workouts in and decompress."
SingleDads,fg6c3f1,t3_ewqhu8,1580563244.0,"I hear you. You ain’t gonna be that guy if you’re spending all day thinking about your son. Even if you don’t have as much custody as you want to have, your son will know that when you are with him, he’s your priority. 

I’m a divorced father myself and I have shared custody and when my kids are with me, it’s all about us. I’m closer with them than I ever could have been if I’d have remained married to their mom. And I parent my own way. It’s been the greatest experience of my life. I don’t see them every day but when I do, I’m not distracted."
panicdisorder,ffs0kf3,t3_eutnve,1580170208.0,Give EMDR therapy a try. It really helped me when I was in the worst stages of panic disorder.
panicdisorder,ffqgds9,t3_euo3he,1580133812.0,"From what I have read, SSRIs can cause a temporary increase in anxiety for a few weeks when you start taking them. It’s supposed to lessen after that. Did your Dr. go through this with you?"
SingleDads,ffeuq1d,t3_et508b,1579866380.0,The sad truth is that you probably never will completely trust a romantic partner again. Not the unconditional way you trusted your ex wife.
Infidelity,ff3wh44,t3_erfqi1,1579550358.0,It’s certainly a bad sign but it doesn’t immediately guarantee that they have an affair going on. Maybe she’s just his “work spouse” (as gross as that concept is). It is definitely a red flag tho- doubly so considering the previous infidelity.
panicdisorder,fezrv1d,t3_eqyvkn,1579460845.0,"You’re stuck in the control loop of panic disorder. But the bracing against panic and clutching to safety behaviors and avoidance is exactly what perpetuates the disorder. I had a psychiatric nurse who prescribed Prozac for me and I was also too scared to take it. Switched to an EMDR psychotherapist who taught me how to change my thoughts and feelings about anxiety and how to calm down when panic started. Was able to achieve remission within a year and when I have relapses of anxiety I float through them and they go away. If you’ve tried these methods and they don’t work for you, then give the pills a shot. Best case they help and worse case they might make you a little more anxious for a short time. Not everyone needs meds for panic attacks. In fact, most people achieve remission with therapy alone."
limerence,fethoyj,t3_eqgzed,1579375587.0,"OP, don’t blame yourself. It just wasn’t a friendship or relationship that was meant to be. For whatever reason, she doesn’t want to keep contact with you. It’s not a reflection of your worth as a person. Honestly, if the friendship was so easily trashed over a small comment like you made, then there wasn’t much to it in the first place. She doesn’t sound like someone who has strong feelings for you. Do whatever you can to focus on other things in your life."
panicdisorder,fer0cf4,t3_eq94wf,1579348119.0,"You can avoid seeking out arguments on the internet. And, if you find yourself in one and it gets nasty, put your phone or laptop down and take a time out for a couple hours. If someone gets personal, block them. They vanish in a cloud of internet particles. It’s refreshing!"

PublicFreakout,fe8edvp,t1_fe8a58a,1578925235.0,"Motor vehicles are intended to be used for transportation. If they are blocked by pedestrians, they can be used to turn around and go a different direction. If your physical safety is threatened, that’s a different matter. But killing someone with your vehicle intentionally because you are “inconvenienced” in your daily life just makes you an evil person. 

And simply allowing motorists to mow down pedestrians who happen to be blocking a road because they have made the road unusable is murder or manslaughter. 

Plain and simple. Morally, legally. 

If the road is being blocked to emergency vehicles then law enforcement should be responsible for clearing it. Not someone in a car with an axe to grind against protestors."
PublicFreakout,fe7zrjp,t1_fe6qid1,1578920928.0,"Not at all. Being stuck in blocked traffic or having to choose another route is a minor to moderate inconvenience for most. It isn’t morally or practically justified to commit grievous bodily harm or vehicular murder against someone just because they have moderately inconvenienced you, even if they did it intentionally or without justification. 

The proper response to seeing a road closed by a protest or demonstration is to choose another route, not commit murder. Your right to your commute is not that precious. If the demonstrators are violating any local ordinances, let the police deal with it."
PanicAttack,fdn6fmq,t3_em6cao,1578578573.0,"Claire Weekes helped me tremendously. I was stuck in a constant loop of anxiety vigilance with all of the attendant depression, monophobia and agoraphobia that comes with it. Reading her books helped me normalize and make sense of all of the feelings I was dealing with. Her chapters on sensitization and bewilderment were especially helpful. It made me realize how much of the anxiety loop was being fed by my own behaviors, responses and beliefs."

If a girlfriend had ever pulled something like this on me, she’d have been gone the next day. People treat you the way you allow yourself to be treated."
asktrp,fddsj5l,t1_fddhk3y,1578322863.0,"Yeah, I would advise against getting married to someone if you already have secrets you need kept. Secrets make you vulnerable. Vulnerability when you have entered into a legal contract with someone who can take half your shit = bad news."

PanicAttack,fcn158i,t3_ei1don,1577800250.0,"You may have mild sleep apnea. You’re waking up when you catch your breath and you get a sudden hit of adrenaline. I used to get this all the time. Night terrors are also a possibility. 

Both are relatively mild and common conditions that could explain waking up and gasping to catch your breath."
asktrp,fck0ppq,t3_ehhwof,1577712948.0,"Here’s some words of encouragement: take no further steps to burden yourself with ANY additional responsibilities until you can support yourself and your daughter on your own. 

Do not marry this woman if the relationship isn’t feeling right. Do not marry this woman out of a sense of obligation or desperation. Get your feet under you. Your daughter needs you to be able to support your lives on your own right now. 

Do you have family or friends you can lean on at this time? There is no shame in getting some backup from your family until you can figure your situation out. It’s not easy being a single father, but I guarantee you going through a divorce because you married needlessly is only going to make it worse for you."
asktrp,fc9n8w6,t3_egpe3e,1577555235.0,"That was a bullshit comment by a director and it says a hell of a lot more about them than it does about you. But without the context of how the politics in your department work, it’s tough to judge what the proper response should have been. 

Some companies are full of shit-talkers and it’s a locker room environment. Everyone gets a turn to dish it out and take it, even the “dominant” alpha rock stars. 

Best thing to do is laugh it off."
