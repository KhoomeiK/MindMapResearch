Padres,fqzck02,t3_glhrrn,1589764522.0,Our boy Gwynn was ahead of his time. I remember watching a documentary years ago talking about how he used video replays to work on his craft. The video/documentary had pieces of this video in it. A lot of people credited him as being one of the first to use video replay in any sport. Gwynn will always be my favorite player in any sport. I miss watching him at jack Murphy. Rip legend.
