I was frowned upon for my appearance and had wide eyed Christians seemingly judge me for who I was at this time and nothing changed about schizophrenia.

Now that's not to say I have a relationship with Jesus Christ, or as I understand Him, as I lived a life of thievery to get by and as it is said, suffered for my sins. I still don't find myself to be religious, but I am more open to God than I used to be and have had a dilusion/hallucination involving God and His angel, Michael, that brought some peace of mind to a very lengthy psychotic episode.

The good I find that is of God is that my psychiatrist has a higher power and was capable of prescribing me correct medication and still be sympathetic of my story.

I guess you could say I'm spiritual, but I don't practice a religion other than being a good, kind soul. I do read about religion and, like I said, am open to the idea that He exists, but no one really can know until the afterlife, though as long as man is alive, God will exist.

TL;DR

It's hard for me to recognize Christ as God in the flesh, though through religious dilusion and mental illness, I can see how he might be the son of God."
