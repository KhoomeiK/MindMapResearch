The100,fqrff4a,t1_fqoyue2,1589583280.0,"It makes you think like if the Ark had had enough oxygen for just one more year up in space they would’ve been up there during praimfaya since they wouldn’t have sent the 100 down and probably would’ve all died up there and even if they did go down, unless they waiting that full six years, they’d have died of radiation. The grounders wouldn’t have found the bunker without Jaha so they would’ve died too. The primes would die out a little over a hundred twenty five ish years later since they were running out of nightbleeders and with how brainwashed the red blooded people were on Sanctum, they might not even survive without them."
The100,fqqqkdj,t1_fqpugy2,1589570169.0,"Yeah I agree. The same people who say her ending up with a guy would be erasing her sexuality are the type of people who tell women they’re straight while they’re in a het relationship or exclude bi people in het relationships from LGBT+ spaces. Also, that’s assuming people are ever going to forget Clexa. Like even if she ends up with Bellamy that doesn’t take away the fact that she had a great love story with Lexa seasons before"

The100,fqmkne1,t1_fqevbu6,1589479016.0,Yeah that’s what I was thinking lmao. Clexa happened and they even had an “I love you” thrown in. I love Bellarke too but Clexa has more to stand on
The100,fqmkid1,t1_fqb4jk3,1589478949.0,I mean you have to admit that the goodbye scene was pretty fricking sad. Lexa jumping over Clarke and saving her in the city of light was amazing. I didn’t see much chemistry throughout season three (except for the death scene) so I felt pretty indifferent to the two of them being together but their goodbye literally broke my heart.
The100,fqmjgwr,t1_fqfcsti,1589478453.0,"I just want a Clexa goodbye with Lexa defeating sheidheda in the chip, Clarke finding closure from Lexa telling her to move on, and then her feeling free to be with Bellamy"
