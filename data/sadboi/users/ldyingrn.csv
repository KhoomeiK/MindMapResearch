flying,fpwbmrs,t3_gduyx6,1588960604.0,ATC likes to know which type of cessna.  For instance I have a 210 that cruises at 160mph.  ATC likes to be told Centurion rather than Cessna.  It is easier for them to know if they are expecting a fast plane like a 210 or one that piddles along like a 150/152.  So when i make my radio calls  I always say Centurion (rather than Cessna)
flying,fpwaai9,t3_gdz1d5,1588959946.0,"I had a similar experience (not quite as bad).  I am a doctor and started my flight training at 39.  I started at a 141.  From the get go I was not treated like I would have expected.  went through multiple instructors who basically sat with me to fly but didnt really teach anything.  Finally found a decent instructor at the school.  Then like an idiot found a good deal on a plane that we liked so bought it even though wasn't finished with my private.  So since we owned our own plane schools said we could no longer be part of 141 had to switch to 61.  So switched to another school because the had someone who had enough hours in our plane to make insurance company happy.  He was a young guy who had no interest in teaching just trying to build hours.  in 20hours with him I learned virtually nothing.  So was about to give up and sell plane, even put it on the market.  Then talked to the instructor we liked and he said while he didn't have the hours he knew an older guy who did.  So we went to him and he has been tons better, though still not what i would have expected.  Soloed in about another 10hours with him.  Life was busy so wasn't flying as much as should have been.  did an online ground course because during shutdown and finally took my written.  I hope to do my check ride when plane finished annual at end of the month.  I would definitely talk to the owner of the school"
modelmakers,fpopan8,t3_gecqfh,1588788330.0,a tip i saw in a video somewhere that helped me a ton is to get some plastic cups (like solo cups but i have dollar store clear ones) and practice spraying on there.  When i put paint/primer into airbrush i play on the cup to get the pressure/consistency etc correct before i start spraying the model and that has helped me a TON.  I have zero input on why it wont spray though.  I use vallejo primer and haven't had any issue with it.

I had a couple issues.  1) you weren't supposed to glue the gunners in and he fell inside the plane.  I ended up having to cut it open and to get it out (glued him in this time).
