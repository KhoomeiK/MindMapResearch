aspergers,fpjkph8,t1_fpjgxpm,1588672156.0,"There is flexibility built into the diagnostic criteria to allow for that. Not meeting enough of them would mean one of two things:

- The assessment was done in a way that OP's traits were missed, e.g. it was not thorough enough, or OP masks very effectively.

- OP actually doesn't meet the criteria. 

There is such variation in the assessment methods and tools used, depending on who you see, that I would be inclined to believe the former. I have heard from other autistic people that they were missed the first time, but received the diagnosis when they went to a different practitioner using a different assessment tool. For example, the ADOS is infamous for missing autism in women. Some assessments are based only on a two-hour interview – mine had eight hours of interviews and cognitive testing using the WAIS-III and ADOS, which seems considerably more thorough and reliable. 

My advice to OP would be to get a second opinion. It should not be your parent doing all the talking for you – they are only there to provide an outside opinion. When I had my assessment, my partner's input consisted of two written forms and no verbal discussion. The main subject of the assessment is you, and it's you they should be talking to. Before going to another practitioner, find out what assessment methods they use, and make sure they are legit.

TrollGC,fpjjkl4,t1_fpidczm,1588670924.0,"This brings up the interesting point of the language used around hormones and BC. A lot of women and medical professionals talk of using BC to ""regulate periods"", but that is false. What happens when you take your week's break is in fact a withdrawal bleed. A period is what happens when the uterine lining is shed after ovulation – therefore, if you can't ovulate because you don't have ovaries, it is impossible to have a ""period"" (""you"" being directed at TiMs here)."

aspergers,fpi1kwd,t3_gdcpvl,1588631863.0,"This is quite hard to answer since I literally have no idea how other people experience sex. All I have to go on is my own experience. 

One thing I have picked up on based on the reports of my male partners is that I am more sensitive than most women. For example, I can't stand vibrators at all, the vibrations are overkill and just feel painful to me.

My SO tells me that I'm not very good at reading the signals when he wants to have sex. He has to be very forward for me to ""get it"". It's hard to say how much else I'm missing, but I've never had any complaints and had overwhelmingly positive feedback – but I have no way of knowing if they were genuine compliments or if they were only saying it to make me want to sleep with them again. I suspect the latter.

I had sex for the first time with my first boyfriend when I was 17 and I've had more than 20 partners. It's not that hard to get laid when you're female I guess."

AskWomen,fpfhlxy,t3_gd0rwi,1588571489.0,"With my ex, the flaws were things like ""cheats on me from time to time"", ""sexually abuses me"" and ""lies to me about where he's going"". 

With my fiancé, it's things like ""tells really bad dad jokes sometimes"" and ""has a couple of shit tattoos"". 

I think you always have a gut feeling about whether a person is good for you, I just didn't listen to mine for far too long. With my ex, I was always judging the relationship on what he was like at his best, but I should have judged him by his worst. My fiance passes that test easily."

aspergers,fp8y995,t1_fp8sl1b,1588407255.0,"My most recent experience with a narcissist was a ""friend"" who became my roommate. I didn't know her that well before living with her, but it quickly came clear to me that she was a very manipulative person with no regard for other people's boundaries. In the early days, I treated her like anyone else and tried to resolve issues peacefully, but she didn't want to meet me halfway. I have always been very prone to bullying and abuse, so I was resolute that I was not going to let her push me around. 

She didn't succeed in manipulating me, and in response, she absolutely *hated* me. She was stealing my things and lying to me about it too. It became extremely stressful for me to live with such a person, so I moved out as soon as possible. On the day I moved out, she was sending me messages saying I'm ""the most manipulative person she's ever met"" (sure...), and I found out from our other roommate that she things she stole miraculously appeared again the moment I was gone. 

At the time I couldn't figure out what I had done to make her hate me so much, but now I believe it's because I didn't play along with her little games. However, I was only able to to that because of past experience – I was in a relationship with a narcissist where I was abused for years. It wasn't that I was in any way fooled by him, I just didn't know how to hold my own. In the past, I would have been a lot more likely to get emotionally sucked in, but knowing what I did, I was able to keep myself more detached.

So yeah, that's my analysis of the situation. I have never been one for drama or stupid mind games, and I have no time for people who behave like that."
