AskReddit,fprsyjx,t3_gexhgi,1588861433.0,"I was a volunteer chaplain in my early 20s. I got a page around midnight describing a man who was in a house fire, severe burns. I get there, and it was awful absolutely burned head to toe. Hair burned, shaking from pain, all of it. Turns out he had woken up to see his trailer was on fire- he jumped out the window and found his girlfriend outside with 2 of their kids, one was still inside. So he of course charged back in to save the boy. The ceiling collapsed, knocked him unconcious, and he was burned badly.

I was told by some of the nurses the boy had died in the fire, but the man didn't know that, the other family members were sent to another hospital. That being said, someone brought him his phone because she had called, and she told him.

It's a hard thing to describe hearing despair of that level. A mixture of pain, mourning, anger, etc. I didn't know what I could do, but I knew I couldn't let him suffer alone. So, I sat down next to him and just talked with him. Talked with him about the boy, about his family, his spiritual life, anything to ease his suffering. I tried to be his intermediary with the hospital staff, for pain, new sheets, etc (his skin would stick to the sheets because of the burns). I was there with him until the burn clinic got there 6 hours later.

I'm not nearly as religious as I used to be, but I still think about that man. To be honest, I'm not sure if he survived, but I truly hope he is alive and at peace."
