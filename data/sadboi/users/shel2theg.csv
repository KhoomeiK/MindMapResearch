Paramedics,f5o4g4z,t3_dohhjz,1572309802.0,"Personally, I didn't have to have experience to get into the paramedic program(I'm still in the program). I started working at a station after I got accepted. That being said, the experience in the field has helped me TREMENDOUSLY. It's definitely not impossible to get your paramedic without experience IF your program allows it. If possible, work at a station either before or while taking the program."
Paramedics,f52qdff,t3_dmkg7h,1571952413.0,Current medic student! Be willing to put in the time to LEARN! Don't just memorize things to pass the test and move on. Do your best to understand why things the way they are.
