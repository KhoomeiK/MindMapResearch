BPD,fkryjb8,t3_fjs14r,1584478595.0,"thanks for writing this. Lots of thoughts about BPD in general...the socialization of it, the gender stuff of it. Have you seen Steven Universe the Movie? The character of Spinel from that always gives me all the feels, I absolutely interpret her as C-PTSD or BPD and trying to heal from it, but hurting others while doing so and learning from her mistakes. It both hurts and heals to watch it."

polyamoryR4R,fknsqxy,t1_fknrzed,1584373139.0,"Have you considered making your own posts instead of critiquing everyone else's? Just a pro tip.

Searching for ""equitable v"" with polyamory on google has literally 6 results. 

Don't tell me what is and isn't my term. Rude AF."
polyamoryR4R,fknriov,t1_fknoy2n,1584372406.0,"Ok. As a heads up using all caps usually reads as upset or angry on the internet. I have read the book you linked in its entirety.

Having two primaries, to me, typically reads as confusing to people. Like this entire exchange. And so to me, it feels pretty non-hierarchical. 

More than that, I view it as a way to note I have made a social, legal, and personal commitments to my primary publicly e.g. a marriage ceremony. I unfortunately can't make that commitment to other people legally - I am not allowed to marry more than one person. Not calling him my primary I think would be strange, because it doesn't accurately describe my relationship with him. To non-polyam folk or those just beginning their journeys, it also can be confusing or hard to grasp. I find it easier to say and explain he is primary, rather than saying nesting partner or anchor partner.

I also view having two primaries as showing I am willing to have a ton of energy and priority placed on a new relationship. Again the opposite of having tiered ranks or disposable secondary or tertiary partners.

I am not interested in relationships that feel ""secondary"" or have no defined/descriptive or prescriptive label, other than at the beginning when I'm truly just getting to know someone. Hence, I say I am looking for a primary, because that most accurately describes the amount of entanglement I am looking for.

I also am not concerned about ""appearing"" hierarchical or looking the most non-hierarchical in a kind of pissing game within polyam communities. I'm more concerned about acting ethically and treating all my partners kindly and giving them the time and attention they deserve. The semantics of that are not important to me. I'm in the LGBTQ community, for example, and also describe myself more often as bisexual, since people know what that means and grasp it easily. But my sexuality can also be described as pansexual or queer, which might be more accurate. But I genuinely do not care. The same with the above.

In short, describe it how you want, our opinions can differ. But please don't attempt to define it for me or believe that your way is the only way to do polyamory."

BPD,fi20y6p,t1_fi1f66d,1582068986.0,"Giiiirl men say a lot of things. And when people are ending things, they say things that sometimes are weird AF. Maybe you weren’t right for each other, but I’d encourage you not to take that rejection to heart. I wonder if bc you’d had casual sex, maybe he felt he couldn’t switch the vibes over. Either way, there are many people out there. 

Take care of yourself. 💙"
BPD,fi1e8f5,t3_f5uetd,1582055994.0,"I think for me I’m working on being less clingy by being more interested in my own projects. Like, focusing on having my own activities that keep me busy when I am spiraling. Taking classes outside of the house and having hobbies. Also putting down the phone so I don’t count the minutes or feel that loss. Does this help at all?"
BPD,fi1duwt,t3_f5t23v,1582055780.0,"First, you are not a stupid slut. There is a lot of societal conditioning around sex and especially women, but it is nothing to be ashamed of.

It sounds like you’re pursuing stuff for reasons that feel beyond your control. Have you tried journaling abt what exactly you want in a sexual partner, romance or experience? That may clarify your goals, intents and standards as well as become something you can add to online dating profiles. It will also give you reasons to reject men or partners that are falling into your old patterns. 

To be honest you are probably a FANTASTIC lay. I myself am bc I suffer the same problems you do and an unhealthy sex obsession or in some cases hypomania, lmao. I’ve gotten a little better tho, with medication for my bipolar 2, and a ton of therapy to process my traumas that are leading to this behavior. 

Something else that might take time and attention is establishing boundaries for yourself. For example, it’s great you are having safe sex and enjoying yourself. A boundary might be, no hookups when you have an 8am, or only hookups when x amount of studying is done, or if you’ve saved up like $100 in your savings. It can feel impossible but I often have to remind myself nobody NEEDS sex or sexual validation and romance to live. Most people have very few sexual partnerships over a lifetime, you’re probably already ahead of the game, experienced, and a hot piece. It’s okay to take some time to center yourself, instead.

Sending you good vibes, from someone who has walked and maybe is walking a similar path."

BPD,fi1cq2g,t1_fhz9bm5,1582055132.0,Is it okay to call in sick if you’re like genuinely sick from mental health? Like suicidal ideation or adjusting to new psych meds for one day?
BPD,fi1cbdg,t3_f5orgb,1582054904.0,"Bruh I’m a lady but I hope it’s okay to comment, I do this too. I have bipolar 2 and “borderline tendencies” with C-PTSD diagnosed by my therapist.

What I’ve realized is that i get a lil hypomanic by the new relationship energy and excitement, as well as sexuality of a new person. For a while i kinda thought that meant love. In my newest relationship, I kinda realized it’s maybe not bc even though I super super like that person and have all these obsessive feelings, I’m not sure i have all the info and time and trust built to really love them. 

For now I’ve promised myself to feel the good feelings, but not share them w my partners if they come up. Letting the other person determine the pace without my interference sometimes means things go more slowly and sane rather than hypersexual and lightening fast. So lately I’ve decided I’m going to let the other person be the first to say I love you, unless I can 100% say it’s a good idea to tell them.

I hope this helps. I think tho, dudes are expected to move things along and make the first move so some of my experiences may not apply or translate, tbh."
CompulsiveSkinPicking,fi0zu6n,t3_f5lb2w,1582047917.0,"Bruh she sucks. Maybe not entirely, but a therapist's job is to motivate you to pursue healthy behavior. She didn't do that, she demoralized you. i'm sure she was trying to motivate you, but failed. 

if you think she might be receptive you could go back and talk about how that comment hit for you. there are a ton of reasons that CSP is not easy to stop. for me, there is a genetic component. for many it might be a subset of OCD. relapsing is completely normal in a healthy process.

is it possible she thought it was a bad habit, not a compulsion or disorder? some people even have to manage this thru medication.

i started counting my triggers and scanning behaviors for CSP recently and on a bad day i had 135. fucking. impulses. I've been counting with pen marks and tallies on my left hand. it stops me from misusing my hands and it also gives me a moment to breathe. it's no wonder i struggle. i am still working on it. it takes time, self-love, and commitment to change your neural pathways around stress --> reward and cessation of anxiety, which is what picking gives all of us. ANY competent therapist should know that. she low key failed you, and im sorry this was your experience first bringing it up."
BPD,ffyn6v2,t3_evx3lf,1580350415.0,"Some therapists are just too poorly trained or don't have the resources to help someone with BPD. That just means they're not the therapist for you.
