Afraid of losing contact with my friends, afraid of losing my bestfriend. We planning to live in an appointment together, we all say things then don't do, I'm hoping we can live together. There will not be a bestfriend like her ever again. She's a great bestfriend, she helps me, supports me, tries to understand me when we have different opinions. And I do the same, she gave me so much love and she's so understanding. But I know even if I'm worried about losing her after high school we will still be bestfriends for a long long time"

AskReddit,fpqyzjb,t3_gexhgi,1588836643.0,"This happened last year in high school, my friends friend died. She killed herself, He was heart broken, I hugged him and I told him it was okay. We were at lunch at the time. I stood up and went into the snack bar and bought a box of his favorite soda. I went back opened it, gave one to everyone in the table and I rose my can and made a toast. He should me who she was and I knew her, she was in 8th grade. 

My toast: ""to Mark's friend (his nickname) even tho I didn't talk to her much, she was a pretty cool person. I'm sad that she went out like this. May she forever rest in piece. I'm sure she's in a better place mark"" and gave him another hug.


Edit: I remember I have another story from last year as well, like exactly around this month.

There's drama in my friend group, a lot, things and times were difficult for all of them. As for me, in January I fell in love for the first time and I was happy with dating her but the drama with one of my friends still kinda just killed everyone else, I didn't like my friends like this. I decided that night to write everyone a letter

I told them how amazing they were just the way they are. How I just know they will make it big and have there dream come true. The friend that cost the drama, even if I was mad at him I still wrote him a letter. He was a gamer and so I told him. To keep on going, he 100% games and I told him I know he will 100% life and live to the fullest.  I loved every one of them. It was kinda hard to love him as a friend at that time lmao. But in the morning I got a lot of replies and it made me happy reading all of them. It made me almost cry from happiest. They all said ""thank you so much"" in their own why. It made me feel happy for doing thay. 

Now every birthday, I do a drawing for them and write a long letter in the back. I did that a little before that happened but now I do it every time. Telling them how much they grown up. My best friend, she was really mean at first but over time I saw her grow as a beautiful  person. And I'm seeing that in every one of them and I couldn't be happier. 

I have some screenshots of their reply if you guys want to see.

Btw I'm on the phone lmao"

writing,fpihp11,t1_fpifoc8,1588641125.0,"Yes it will, to be honest i actually never read like big books, i mostly read manga and sub animes lmao. You should read your work out loud and check it about 3 times each chapters, maybe more because each time you will find mistakes. My work didn't really sound good at first, I wrote a wired start but as I kept on writing and giving myself ideas, I rewrote the into to my book to make it more appealing. Make it a mystery or taste something that will have a big impact on the story. For me I had a lot of editing to do, and over time, my god I realized how bad I was at first. Like you had no idea, I had no knowledge of anything, I just wrote and I'm like this sounds good them my bestfriend who is a bookworm craped on me and thanks to her I've become better with many things. Have at least 1 person to read the first chapter to see what they think or what you can do better. Then maybe later have a different person read it. Don't take what they think you should add unless you like really like it. It's all about what you as an author like more. Maybe they can give you an idea to how to change a sentence to be more impactful or something like that. 

You know you have a good story if you are having fun  writing it. 

Remember if you ever publish a book, there's gonna be up and downs. Some people may like it, some people won't. And it may take time to sell."
writing,fpichss,t3_gdfeg7,1588638087.0,"I'm also a high schooler, I started writing in freshman year, start by letting your ideas flow for awhile. Look back at them and see what is wrong and what you don't like. Look for unnecessary sentences or words. Find didn't words to use for an impact of something important. Have an idea for a future chapter and find a good place to foreshadow it. Find a clean format to do on your story. Make sure once you do, think about the future of the story and make a timeline, how the characters meet, how dose things line up. Make a list of all characters and decide what they are/who they are and importance. Write next to then what they want to do/be. Write peces of their Back story then fill in the blinks. Maybe write their character arc. 

I'm in my 3rd year of high school and I've took some breaks, been procrastinating sometimes. But over time I am slowly getting better and better and been loving writing. Make sure you have someone read and criticize your work, criticizing is good. It helped me improve so much since the beginning of my writing journey, I have many more ideas for other books. Things may have not be good at first but we all don't start out perfect. Good luck on this journey"
