rant,f6q3fuy,t1_f67xt4h,1573070176.0,"I actually agreed with you a couple years ago. I heard all lives matter, and I was like, “yeah, they fucking do” but my thoughts have moved and grown so much since then because of what I’ve taken in. I don’t often return to the original opinion that you’re expressing.

I feel like you could learn a lot if you try to take in all of those viewpoints that exist out there, whether they are valid or not. It’s fun to challenge and confirm or deny your opinions."
rant,f6q2m62,t3_dqepst,1573069660.0,"Yes of course we can agree to disagree. It takes all sorts after all! I guess what I’m saying is that I heard my peers say things like this when I was younger, and then it got less common as they aged. Not to say that teenagers are stupid, just that there are more people who see things this way as youths. 

Yes older people can still be ignorant, etc. But generally people learn things as they gain life experience. 

I see the opinions about this issue as like a multi layered sphere, where certain ideas are located at different coordinates. So our ideas may be the same in one or two aspects but differ greatly in others. Like a multidimensional Venn diagram. 

Ideas can move from a central point in endless directions as they grow and evolve. 

So from my viewpoint the ideas you expressed have many ways to move before they encompass the big picture. 

I don’t think having these ideas as an adult is a good or bad thing, it’s just indicative that there is more to think about. 

You are totally entitled to your opinion that I am missing the point."

Of course it’s pompous to dismiss her in the way he does, but I see it more as a natural handicap the songwriter has developed. Like in his mind he feels jaded and wise and sad is his reasoning, rather than narcissism.
