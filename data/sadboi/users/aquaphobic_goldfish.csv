I can't wear my cochlear implant with the mask I have because the elastic that loops around my ears knocks the implant off. And of course I can't lipread anyone who is wearing a mask. So I only wear one when I absolutely have to because it makes me feel frustrated and vulnerable. That means only going out to do food shopping, which I try to get done in as short a time as possible. Yes, I know there are masks available with clear inserts over the mouth to allow deaf people to lipread the person wearing it but I have yet to see anyone wearing that kind of mask. Still I'd rather deal with wearing a mask for now than stop wearing it prematurely and end up being diagnosed with coronavirus."

When you have hearing loss, there is really no way to participate in a group conversation where everyone else is hearing if no one in the group is making an effort to help you keep up with what is being discussed. Communication is a two way street after all, and there needs to be effort on both sides. You can try enlisting the help of someone in the group to repeat enough of the conversation for you that you are aware of the topics being discussed. And remember there are almost always side conversations going on in any group, so don't feel that you can't engage one person at a time in conversation if that is what works best for you. Also don't assume that your hearing friends know/remember that you need help in groups, or what kind of help you need. You need to tell them what you need, over and over again if necessary. If you are with a group of friends, they should all understand that you have hearing loss and do what they can to help you participate in the conversation. If they aren't willing to do that, then there is really no point to your being there."
