It worries me more because this also could mean my medication is no longer working, I actually cried on Discord with some of my friends...it was awful but it felt good at the same time to tell them what’s going on and get help from them. I learned I could come to them because I didn’t believe I could for years now. 

I guess I’m ranting myself now, but yeah. I’ve needed help. I cried talking to a lady from the hospital and I’m waiting to see if I get a call about counseling through there, it hasn’t happened yet and it stings."

I hope it does stay working for you long term without you having to mess with other medications.

I understand the drinking part as well. But that is a good way to gauge it now, does it scare you when you get very low again?"

I also decided I was going to quit smoking cigarettes, is it possible I’m becoming anxious over that too?

How did you like them if I can ask? I’m happy with what I’m on now and it’s why I don’t want to switch. I hope your happy to stay where you want to medicine wise, I assume it’s too early to tell if Zoloft is working?"

But, it’s possible to stay strong it it’s a process, I know it is. Believe in yourself though, because the pain in a fucked up way is making you stronger.

I started using Bath & Body Works body wash. It’s helping more than I’ve expected."

I also will write my overall opinions towards the game but don’t forget to mention how the game and story is first. 

If it’s got spoilers make it known regardless of how old the game is. People are extremely touchy douchebags over it."

I feel like the depression makes me remember things completely wrong or backwards, I wish I would’ve wrote things down. Does it help you that you did write things down? I imagine the things wrote as a teenager can be funny and crazy all in one.

I never even had that thought cross my mind of doing that but maybe...it’d be good to do. I’ll neglect a few myself too it’s what I always do...some things can be hard to come up with.

I get in the loop with music of sad ones. It makes it all worse but I still continue to do it. I’ve never thought about visual cues either, truthfully I’ve never done much to help myself till I started getting worse.

Depression can change the memories and all, can’t it? I suppose that’s the part of not being able to say how you felt. It’s a tricky thing I’ve noticed..I do want to make the list. I’ve been telling myself for a week now I’d clean the room. It’s not clean, it looks worse. I got storage boxes...I filled them but they aren’t under the bed or in the closet. They just lay out in the room with the dirty laundry and unmade bed. 

Hmmm...I’ll definitely figure out some activities and share them! My knee has arthritis already so it’s absolutely brutal but I shouldn’t be complaining about that since it’s just one. Can you do any activities on the floor maybe? Like only moving your upper body? 

Mine would do the same...but I always avoid it anyways."
depression,ex2r8io,t3_cr4pcx,1565973999.0,"Video games. Play them and try new ones especially quest heavy ones or multiplayer ones even. You’ll have to find people and believe me I know it’s rough when you have zero passion. Zero motivation to do anything. 

If you have to force yourself into doing what you normally enjoy. It’s not easy but it’s something."
depression,ewyqowr,t1_ewydtkd,1565885380.0,"It’s been pretty rough. I never actually coped with the rape so I think that affects me. 

You sound like you’ve enjoyed going to see yours. How do you weed out the one who’s looking for a paycheck? The one I went too wasn’t even in person she made me do it through Skype. I was told I’d see her. I drove 30min for her to tell me nothing really.  

So, the timetable it can be anything written on it? Like whatever made you happy or potentially sad? I want to give that a shot and see what it does for me. I’ve never tried anything like that. 

Damn. I’m so sorry you had/have to go through all of that. I hope you were able to find a job you love. I’m not sure what I could say for the infertile part that would be even slightly helpful and not hurtful. I hope your doing good after the split, sometimes it’s best relationships don’t work out how we wanted them too. 

I couldn’t imagine myself 10 years later either. It’s always blank for what my life is going to be even next year. I don’t know what I want and I’m not sure I’ll ever know. I’m glad your starting to have that vision though, it could be one of the best things.

I unfortunately think I’m in the same boat as you on this one. The most pressing stressors for me can’t truly be resolved, they will always be there in the back of my mind. I’m not even sure therapy would help me with that.

 Woah. Those are all what I do but it’s true. If I stop doing what I truly enjoy then...it makes me worse. I need the distraction like I do today pretty badly. I wish I could make friend irl, all of mine are online and even then I just tolerate a few of them. I guess it’s the same though, isn’t it? Friends are friends no matter where they are.

Huh...I guess I never realized how many little things we can actually do to make yourself feel even slightly better. I might have to start doing a lot of these things today but super spaced out. I want to do the journal but I’ve always thought it was “silly” or “pointless.” I’m starting to realize that maybe it’s not. 

I’m limited on outdoor activity unfortunately but I may try to walk a trail regardless at some point soon.  

I want to go out and be around more people (I hate people normally) I think part of my problem is not going out and being around people and such.

I may follow you on that advice of doing things for myself after being with people and doing things."
depression,ewy0jbc,t3_cqp1cf,1565872278.0,"I understand the negativity. I would always think about the bad parts of my life, the bad what ifs. Here recently I forced myself into “positive thoughts.” I’m still unsure how I feel about it, but I’ve cut out what ifs. It can be a little helpful...I think it’s all about finding a way to cope yourself. 
I’m still lost most days but it’s been okay I guess. 

I’ve thought of suicide, I don’t want to act on it. I tried when I was 14. It fucked with myself and my family hard, it was a super bad time and I’ll never forget the place I was sent."
