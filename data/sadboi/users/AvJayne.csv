It is sort of unnatural (although very common nowadays) to be with someone with a child, especially as a childless person. We have to constantly be reminded of a very intimate past. It’s painful, disgusting and infuriating on my bad days and a minor nuisance and laughable on my good days."

stepparents,fpq4eoy,t3_gemwnt,1588814945.0,"Same here... I get the same “you always have a problem” or “you’re always negative about him.” Yeah, well I am his only parent. BM is a disordered drug user who barely bothers with him and Dh’s idea of parenting is throwing a ball around and then being done for the night. They both are totally in denial (BM is basically unaware) about the fact that their son who was held back a year is bottom of the class barely hanging on. His social emotional skills are that of a toddler at nearly 7 and his teachers have all shown concern. He spends all day throwing himself on the floor, jumping and slamming himself into things, yelling, arguing, complaining. So sorry I’m so negative about the child you think is going to sprout into a productive, mature citizen without intervention. They’re in for such a rude awakening."

I think I’m so zen about it because DH and I are adopting and finally done with our home study and waiting to be matched.  So I feel some sort of hope this year or something.

Earlier on, when we were first dating, I used to sometimes notice his loyalties still seemed to be with her. Minor things... but there were times I felt he would be slightly protective over her. To an extent I understood it, after all...I too, have loved losers in my past, but I’m extremely outspoken so I’d remind him a lunatic with multiple drug arrests, who he impregnated after a couple weeks of knowing her, isn’t exactly a woman worthy of great praise. I don’t care if she gave birth to his son - who she wasn’t entirely sure was his initially. Doesn’t mean a damn thing if you can’t be a good mother and person. And she’s neither.

I can say now that we are married there is no loyalty whatsoever. She isn’t even a halfway decent mother so I’d laugh in his face if he tried to put her on any kind of pedestal. 

Just because I’m a stepmother doesn’t mean I’ll come second. I’m his WIFE and I expect to be respected as such."

I married a guy with a kid, and so I didn’t ever feel pressure from him to reproduce. His “baby mama” is a typical breeder, she just pops kids out with whoever she is casually dating. Total loser.

I also don’t think this world is the kind of place I want to bring a child into. I’ll raise one who’s already here though.

That said, I’ll be a working mom after I adopt. I couldn’t sit home with a kid all day long. I’d lose my mind. I like to have my own thing going on.

I work in a small office, but my husband is a delivery driver for a large food company and I have a son in school.  So far we are taking precautions by more frequent hand washing and keeping hand sanitizer on us. I am disinfecting surfaces at work and home daily (sometimes multiple times) and I am being careful not to touch my eyes/nose/mouth.  It is so hard not to be paranoid because my asthma flares so badly when I get sick.  I had a virus in November that knocked me down for a month, and I ended up on prednisone. 

A woman in my office had a cold/mild illness the last few weeks after going on a trip (not to a virus ridden area... but still) and I was absolutely disgusted with her for coming into work.  It caused me awful anxiety.

I am taking extra vitamin c, d, and zinc, I am ordering my groceries online and having them delivered, and staying home a lot (which I do anyway).  My family and I have tickets to a hockey game next weekend, and if virus numbers greatly increase in my state from now until then I definitely will not be going.

stepparents,fjgdz21,t1_fjg2e2w,1583323510.0,Thank you. We are fortunate he has been placed with us from the start and that BMs low life boyfriend isn’t allowed around him. It would just be nice if DH could hang onto sole legal custody until BM can show that she’s capable of making an even somewhat rational decision for her own life ... let alone a child’s.

stepparents,fj0rxmy,t3_faom5u,1582906508.0,"I understand how hurtful it is to hear that.  I've felt it.  Somehow we are made to feel like we are less.  I also realize giving birth to a baby and becoming a stepparent are vastly different experiences.  I have come to accept most people are not going to validate my role as a stepmom.  Many people will not see it as ""real mothering.""  I am at a place where I am okay with that. I am also adopting, and plenty of people have their opinions on that too.

As long as you know your place in your family, as long as you know that you are a real parent, that is all that matters."
stepparents,fin6unh,t1_fin09gw,1582557161.0,"I wasn’t about to lie to him, either. It is what it is!"
stepparents,fin6ss6,t1_fimxcgb,1582557128.0,"I called him out after. I also explained to him that once I removed myself, SS got in bed with dirty hands and a chocolate milk. I told him he can play bad cop and remind him we wash up before bed and no milk in the bedroom. I can’t always be the bad guy!"
stepparents,fin6pf1,t1_fimwqtc,1582557066.0,"You seem extremely self aware and I admire that! I also want to raise a capable, down to earth kid! DH does too, in theory. Lol. Have a good week as well."
stepparents,fims9fn,t1_fimr67q,1582545008.0,I don’t think he sees it. DH has definitely worked on many aspects of his parenting but there is still a ways to go. I think he takes the easy way out a lot of the time. Tip toes around him as not to upset him. I’d rather the kid learn coping skills. Learn how to do a chore or 2. Etc.
stepparents,fims4lc,t1_fim88jy,1582544859.0,"Thank you. It’s worth noting I am a full time stepmom as well. He sees BM for supervised visitation EOW. I go above and beyond for him in every sense of the word and I’m there to take him to school every day, his doctors appts, etc. That made DH scolding me even more insulting."
stepparents,fims0k4,t1_fimgetv,1582544727.0,"Exactly. The other alternative was to lie to him. I told him the truth. I didn’t see anything wrong with that. It’s life, and he needs coping skills for when life isn’t fair."
stepparents,filqv5e,t1_filp99f,1582508127.0,"Maybe it was the scolding me that got me. Overall, it just didn’t sit well with me."
AskReddit,fikm7h9,t3_f80qhl,1582482979.0,"Started sleeping with a guy from work who had a live in girlfriend and new baby. She knew his girlfriend and described her as nice, yet after work she would go with him and park behind a building and have sex with him. Then he would go home to his girlfriend and child. Gross. I realized this friend has no self respect. We are still friends but certainly not as close after that."
infertility,fi5n7dk,t3_f6djtp,1582166639.0,"I feel like now that my husband and I are going through the adoption process I am getting the opposite. My mother and MIL were sad that I didn’t “try harder.” I got all sorts of weird reactions... someone I work with, when I proudly told her we are adopting said “just do IVF!” Or people tell me “you can still keep trying for you own too” or “after you adopt maybe you’ll be more relaxed and end up with one of your own.”

I’ve never felt more unsupported or alone. So honestly I think no matter what a person with infertility does - it’s never fucking “right.”  Everyone has to have an opinion. They aren’t the ones going through the heartbreak of watching basically everyone around you conceive while you struggle. We know our bodies, we know our minds and hearts and what works for us. 

Adoption/IVF/deciding to rescue and mother pigs and chickens... honestly no matter what we do to follow our gut instincts is our business! People suck."
stepparents,fi5lxuq,t1_fi51926,1582165910.0,Women who’s only accomplishment in life is giving birth always love to put down women who can’t or have not ever given birth. As if the animal act of procreating gives them some amazing wisdom and superpower. I’ve met plenty of absolute disasters who are also mothers - and yet this type of thinking somehow still exists.
stepparents,fi5lb4h,t3_f6b3ht,1582165549.0,"I agree that it is important for my stepson to have one on one time with his dad. I think earlier in the relationship I was a bit more triggered and felt left out and now I’m just glad to have “me time.” I also think it’s sort of ridiculous when therapists or bio parents or all-knowing friends/family members make it seem like it’ll be detrimental to the kid if the new significant other is there a lot of the times. I don’t see why you have to hide in the corner while dad does potty time or whatever other mundane routine task. Kids need love but they also need to be able to live in reality. When parents split they form new family units. You aren’t the bio but when you’re in your house you’re part of that unit. It took me what feels like forever to truly own that, but now I do and I rarely question my place simply because of biology. It used to destroy me but now it’s like congratulations you had a kid with my husband and he left and hates having to deal with you. Biology only means so much. It never made BM a good mother...

 If you have a BM who gets weird around school meetings and doctors appointments and wants you nowhere near that kind of thing, then use it as time to do your own thing. You aren’t missing much, lol. It’s all about owning your position in your home and letting the bio own her position in hers."
Adoption,fi5jztz,t3_f6llqg,1582164777.0,"I understand what you mean about it seeming impossible. I’m in the middle of it and it still seems impossible. Cliche but it’s literally one step, one moment at a time. I just keep pushing forward with it and figuring it out as I go."
Adoption,fi5jvnl,t3_f6llqg,1582164708.0,I’m mid 30’s going through the process and was told our wait time will likely be 12-18 months. Of course no guarantees but 10 years seems extreme.
raisedbynarcissists,fi2q9n8,t1_fi255w1,1582086037.0,Oh wow - relatable! I have a stepson who my parents barely acknowledge! Infertility lead me to this decision - nmom will always think I didn’t “try” hard enough. I was emotionally exhausted and done - finally listened to my heart. Thanks for responding!
raisedbynarcissists,fi1ctv9,t1_fi0pnt6,1582055192.0,"Thank you so much for responding. That is exactly what I fear, using this baby as a weapon. Finding ways to slide into my life with a backhanded comment or remark to make me feel like a bad mom. Making me second guess my reality. And you are so right - it’s the little girl longing for approval. I’ve done this for so long."
stepparents,fhubcet,t3_f4nshd,1581884302.0,"I currently have no children of my own and we have ss6 90% of the time. It was ROUGH at first for me. He has ADHD and was tough to handle. It’s gotten better. DH and I are in the middle of the domestic adoption process so soon (hopefully) I will be a mom. 

Sometimes I worry about how the stress of being “insta mom” of two children will be for me... and it makes me bitter and resentful at times that BM isn’t a better mother. My husband is a trucker (anyone who is married to a truck driver will know what those hours are like) so a lot of responsibility falls on me.

On my best days, I’m proud to be my stepson’s mom who is there for him each day.

On my worst days, I feel like a fraud, my patience wears thin and I wonder why I’m even here.

I’ve learned it’s crucial to take breaks when you can, learn how to tune out the noise when you have to, and to not take yourself so seriously."
stepparents,fhev2nj,t3_f2o8yo,1581530504.0,"Your heart is in the right place. I raise my SS6 so BM knows better than to try to pull rank like that, and these posts make me thankful for it.

A good rule of thumb is no contact when stepchild is with other parents. Unless they call you. Again, I raise my SS and I have good reason to want to check in with him because BM is a trainwreck, but I do not. Her time.

She is obviously a bit insecure. Just remember that and it'll be easier to accept."
stepparents,fh9scow,t3_f1rtxf,1581388491.0,"I hear you. Hate is not healthy, it’s not productive blah blah but I fuckin hate BM too. It’s hard not to. It makes no sense to good parents to just pawn your child off and not give a shit unless it’s convenient, but to some women apparently it’s the norm. And it’s disgusting and annoying and insulting. And we don’t want to disengage because we love our step kids and why shouldn’t they have a mom figure at home who actually pays attention?? But it’s stressful and it takes up a ton of time and energy. And “ where’s dad?!l “ is always the question but even if dad is perfectly lovely, as nearly full time step moms we are in the trenches too. So i know how you feel. And when you lay down at night just remember you have a good heart and you’re a good person for caring when you don’t “have to” and exhausting yourself to make a kids life a bit better and more predictable."
