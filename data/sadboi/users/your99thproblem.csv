I’m a social worker, an adoptive parent & previously fostered. The majority of parents that fail to 
get their children back from DFCS are selfish. They put their own needs above their children; that’s what makes a bad parent. 

Nutrition/shelter are of course important & vital, but a person’s inability to provide a specific standard of living is not a bad parent. You can be a good parent and poor at the same time. The availability of disposable income is viewed as success (in the US anyway) but it’s a façade."

I’ve seen plenty of interracial adoptions, including black families with white or Hispanic children, and culturally diverse black families (AA/Hispanic/Haitian/West Indian etc) intertwining.

However, each family is different. If you have reservations, tell them up front that you prefer black children places in your home for foster to adopt from now on. There’s NO shame in having a preference. Overall it’s about what’s best for the child & if race can be a potential problem it’s better to not explore that option. Good luck!"

HOWEVER....because there was no record of the payment my mom told her attorney he “abandoned us”  & therefore ruined my Christmas because she had to pay rent so there was no $ for a tree or presents.

1) allow them to earn some small amounts of money from chores SPECIFICALLY for the trip. You would tally up the amounts for them instead of actually paying them so they don’t risk spending it. 

2) If & when they are employed again, encourage them to give you a percentage of their income towards the trip the same day they are paid.
