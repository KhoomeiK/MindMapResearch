AskWomenOver30,fm238ry,t3_fsd82z,1585689809.0,"I am influenced by societal pressures much of the time. I go through times of internally agonizing over the fact my life does not match up with ""the ideal"".
However, when I can stop and gain perspective, I realize the true desires of my heart don't necessarily mesh with the supposed ideal.

The feeling of inadequacy stem from my ego and a need to be accepted (a very normal human desire) but also from a desire to be adored. It's trying to get my sense of self-worth from the external world. It creates so much internal noise. It blocks me from being at rest in my own skin.

When I analyze the markers of success (according to our society) I realize:

Do I need the house? Eh, not really. A tiny-house would be cool, but so long as I have a nice place to call my own, I'm good.

Do I need the husband and kids? I don't know. It might be nice, but I am also good on my own.

Do I need the high-powered professional status? Nah. I would like a meaningful career, but it doesn't need to be particularly prestigious.

The marketing and advertising industry has caused me a lot of angst over the years and I'm so over it! I hope to get more comfortable with being me and living life to the best of my ability."

I really appreciated what you said about accepting yourself on a human level regardless how productive you might be at a given time. Not finding one's value in external measures is so fundamental.

You could always decide to make some healthy adjustments for yourself, and then share your plans with her, asking if she'd like to join you. Like, if you want to eat healthier and decide to plan healthy meals ask her to look up recipes with you, or, ask her if she'd like a joint membership at some gym, maybe mention you're going to go swim laps at the local pool and ask if she'd like to join, etc.

Also just being honest, reassure her that you love her regardless of her physique, but that you've noticed she's gained a lot of weight recently and you're concerned for her health. It's an uncomfortable conversation, but if a family member I know loved me, came to me and told me they'd noticed weight gain and were concerned, I might feel vulnerable/be defensive at first, but I would likely listen and try to implement change. 

I know my loved ones would only tell me something like that directly if it was a legit concern. Sometimes when you are the one gaining weight (I've always struggled with maintaining my weight) it is easy to live in denial, continuing to tell yourself, ""it's not that bad"" until one day, it legit is that bad. Also, weight gain isn't the end of the world, it's a part of life! 

Making changes in one's lifestyle isn't easy or all that enjoyable at times, but we have choices and sometimes we have to change our behaviour/attitude in order to feel and be our best!
Just approach the conversation with love and understanding, how she reacts is not your responsibility."
