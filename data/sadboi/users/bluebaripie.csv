relationship_advice,fbybzwm,t3_ef0ugo,1577213112.0,"Okay hi. This is kinda hard to write out and it’ll be pretty long but I want to help you as best I can. 
My blood-related brother (17m now, but 13m when it started) used to sneak into my (20f now, 16f when it started) room at night and touch me. This went on over the course of 3 years and took 2 years to get parents to do something. The fact that y’all have already begun to work on things is good and I am very glad that y’all have the communication line started and that you want her to be safe. 
As it has been explained to me, at age 13, he didn’t understand his body or his feelings and had no idea how to express things or figure himself out, as he had absolutely no friends to talk to and didn’t feel like he could go to parents. 
It sounds like 13m needs someone he can talk to to figure out his feelings, and 11f and 13m need to be separated at any and all costs. The worst thing for both of them is to be near each other and for him to have any sort of access to her. Even with him in the basement that is not enough distance. I would highly recommend getting a hotel room for 13m and whoever needs to stay with him. 11f needs to feel that he has repercussions for his actions and is taken promptly away from her and that her feelings and her need to feel safe are of the utmost importance here. She needs to see a therapist as soon as possible to work out the anger she’s probably going to feel about this situation, the betrayal from her family member, but if you can make her feel safe again ASAP and let her explore the whole house and know he’s not there, it’ll help tremendously. He needs to have someone to talk to about his feelings and impulses and curiosities. Hopefully it wasn’t something that 13m is going to end up developing into a regular habit, but getting both of them help is a great start. My brother saw a criminal sex psychiatrist, someone who deals with people who have uncontrollable urges and impulses. She has helped him immensely. Find a therapist who specializes in these things if you can because they will understand how to help him work through it."

trashy,eu6x450,t3_cf02jm,1563511308.0,"A lot of comments have been about the kids, and tbh this might be a shit opinion, but as happy as she is with her body, she’s setting a horrible example of what beauty is for her kids. 

Let me get one thing straight; I’m not a psychologist, nor do I know a ton about it. But it’s gotta be bad. 

Like, that’s got to psychologically have an impact on the kids. Her daughters are growing up thinking that’s what beautiful should look and feel like, because that’s how mommy finally felt beautiful. She should feel confident in herself but with EIGHT kids I feel like it’s a little much to express that THAT is what beauty means, and she encourages other women to alter to that extent as well (if they previously expressed interest, according to her interview)

People can do what they want, have whatever procedures they want, to help them look and feel their best. I get it, and I totally support it. Power to the people who are brave enough to make themselves into who they really want to be. But those little girls might never feel satisfied with their bodies because they grew up seeing mommy change her body continuously into the extremity she’s at now until she felt beautiful. Those little boys will probably women differently, and possibly base their beauty in breast size, just like mom did. 

The oldest kid regularly expresses how frustrated he is with her. She even stated that, “it’s part of our landscape.” Big boobs shouldn’t be the focus of a family. She even says she KNOWS it’s over sexualizing. 

I don’t know. It just seems wrong. And gross. And a bad example."

Something helpful that I like to do is squeeze whatever is near me. Usually I dissociate sitting down, so I’ll slowly grab a pillow or my wallet or whatever just to have something physically stimulating my nerves while simultaneously being inside my own head. 

If the squeezing does work, I try tapping my fingers.
