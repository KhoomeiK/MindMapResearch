AskDID,f7o7ex3,t3_dx8r6t,1573922258.0,"Hi there,

I don’t have DID but I know two systems and am familiar with DID. 

When he says his alters are in the room, he could be referring to a room where they go to front so someone else could be co-conscious or just aware of what’s happening. However, I’d ask about this one. If you’re not sure about asking questions, you can ask them something like, “is it okay if I ask some questions about DID so I can support you all better?”

For your second question; the host is an alter as well and different alters can be hosts at different times. But alters can definitely front as much as the host particularly in times of stress but also in general. The host is just the one who often deals with most everyday stuff. 

Different alters often do have different handwriting.

In terms of support, just try to make sure they know you are there if they need anything. And ask them what they need because every system and every alter in a system needs something different. 

*Maybe* ask them if there’s any triggers you should know about if you think they would be comfortable with this(depending on how close you are to them.) But before asking this I’d ask permission to ask them and make sure they know they don’t have to answer(talking about triggers can be triggering for some people.) 

So really, just try to gently ask them. Try not to be hurt if they don’t tell you something. It’s probably not because of you; it’s just because some information is very sensitive.

Message me or reply to this if you have any other questions."

I have a mother who is similar. 
While I would love to take care of her, I’m not her therapist and it’s kind of unhealthy for me to be. 
When I was teen I was also extremely guilty about it, but we need to live our lives. You can try to help and point her to resources but not at your expense. Even if she’s not doing you any real harm, you’re not a therapist or a doctor. It’s not your job to help her and how are you even supposed to? You’re 16, you probably don’t even have a bachelors degree. 

She’s your mother, not the other way around.

Do what you can and want but if she has an unreasonable expectation of you that’s not her fault. 

EDIT: It also depends on how long this goes on. If she just needs some extra support for a little while that’s understandable but if this is something going on for a while it does become a bit problematic."

Sometimes the people surround you don’t understand, don’t care, or just for whatever reason aren’t helping. That your doctor said that is unacceptable. The state of mental health services is pathetic, and that’s not your fault. But that also means that they’re not necessarily right.

You know them best so do what you feel is best. Let them know you’re there for them, and that whenever they’re ready you’ll be there. That sounds like what you’re already doing. 

I wish you luck with all of this. None of what you’re doing is easy, but you’ll get through it. I’m currently by myself as well so I guess I’m wishing both of us luck.

DID,f3irc1r,t3_dgdhk4,1570941116.0,"The other comments have been perfect. 

The one thing I’ll add is that none of this is your fault. Not what happened to your best friends and girlfriend, not the car crash and nothing that happens now and in the future. When your friend consoled you about your fear; you’re not a mind reader. Taking care of people can be a hard thing and you can be constantly on call. Things will slip through the cracks, but it’s not your job to take care of them. You can’t spend all of your attention on them. Even if you do, you’re not them and you’re not in their head(although I’ve definitely wished I was at times just so I could take care of them better.) But you need to have a support system too and a life outside of them. Just like they need to. 


I can’t answer your questions. I’m sorry. But for now, maybe reminisce and try reflect on things that happened prior to their suicide attempt and your car crash. Then afterwards, you can start at a better point if things go well. 

I think another commenter said to build a support system. While I do completely agree. sometimes things with other people are hard so you may have to depend on yourself. So maybe start trying to be a part of your own support system. I know this is far easier said than donebut sometimes you need to be the one to support yourself. I know this might seem a very lonely way of viewing things and to an extent it is but it can also make you feel much less alone. You always have you, so in this period of time figure out how you can support, take care, and learn about yourself and what you need both with your girlfriend and otherwise. However things go, you’ll hopefully be in a better place. 

I hope this all turns out as okay as possible.

DID,f3insb9,t1_f3aw0k4,1570939459.0,"I’ve had a similar experience and I agree with everything you’ve said. My partners system had 500+(past tense because they recently unintentionally integrated.) It seems as though you’re not with them anymore but if you ever want to talk, you’re welcome to message me."
DID,f3imgdk,t3_deodds,1570938847.0,"This happened with me as well. When I first met them they were the host but by the time we were dating they were not. Even before then they would only spend a few- max 6 hours out. Once we started dating I remember one day where they were out for maybe 4 hours straight and that was a big thing. This was when we were in the same state and then country. We both went to a boarding school together(we’re high schoolers.) They had to leave the school and for that past several months have been living in another country. 

Other people in their system are also dating other people. In the state they moved to they met another system and 3 people from their system are dating people from that system. There’s also a system member in a relationship with someone they met in another location. 

So no, it’s not unheard of. Although this is one of the first posts I’ve seen from someone dating someone other than the host. I’m glad to know there’s someone else. 

I think setting that schedule is the best thing. We weren’t able to because they didn’t know when they would have their phone so we couldn’t, but I think that would’ve been very helpful. 

Other advice might be to take care of yourself. I read your other post about them being in the hospital and I think you mentioned that you sometimes keep things back because they’re dealing with a lot. I did that too, but I do think it’s important to make sure they know what they need to know and that there’s nothing that you’d be upset if you were never able to tell them. 

In addition, seeing them so little can be really stressful. Before my partner unintentionally integrated they were going in and out of dormancy and I rarely saw them. Before that they took on a leadership role within their system of 500+ people. They were basically king of a country and had all of the diplomatic responsibilities that came along with that(they even had to get married, platonic marriage, but that still happened). Time went 20 times faster in their inner world for that period of time but this still went on for maybe 2-4 of my months. So I definitely know it’s hard to not see them much. It can be helpful to try to develop a support system and friendships with people outside of their system. This is a problem I am currently facing as well and I know it can be difficult especially since people often can’t understand DID. I’ve been met with responses trying to explain why they don’t have DID instead 

What’s also been a problem for me is that my life became so tied to their system but I am not a part of their system. My best friend and my partner were both people in their system. I have maybe 3 friends outside of it, but the people in their system were who I was closest too. While this is amazing, I’m not part of their system and you aren’t part of your partners system. At times, I think it can become easy to become very sucked into and focused on their life as opposed to your own. There are also situations where you’ll feel the distance between their relationships with your system and with yourself. So I guess just be careful and aware of that. 

This isn’t really advice, so I’m sorry about that. But I think just ask for what you need and try to isolate 2 things that you need from them the most. I’ll try to elaborate more on any advice later and I’m sorry about how this post ended up  and how much about my own experiences with it it is. 

Also, sorry about the length and lack of editing. I just wanted to make sure I wrote this before going to bed.

DoesAnybodyElse,f3i919m,t3_dfyl0p,1570933705.0,"I’m not in therapy but I have gone through this same thing. I have several friends with DID and they’ve also noticed it but I think I’m lower on the spectrum because like you I don’t really have defined alters; just sort of personality states(?) sometimes. The main difference from DID is that I’m conscious(although with varying levels of connection) to what I’m doing. I don’t switch or lose time. I could describe it more but I think these are the main points. 

I don’t know what it is either, but my best guess is depersonalization/derealization.

I’ve been like this for several months and I’ve also developed visual snow. It’s definitely become a bit problematic. I’m not sure what exactly causes it but it seems to be when I’m more stressed. Was there a change in your life three months ago? There may be something triggering this. 

I’m not in therapy, but I’m sorry yours isn’t being supportive. Is there any chance you could look into other therapists?"
