GTAV,fqy9ulm,t1_fqy7s9c,1589745108.0,"Well before he wasn't before as he was constantly running from police. The only reason he was able to escape and live in a nice house with a family he has a love hate relationship with is because when he turned himself in he got lucky. But the problem wasn't with the people he was doing corrupt things with. It was himself which is why he still is sort of an asshole when we start playing the game. This is because Michael is giving everything the bear minimum effort in his life because all his friends and family (besides his immediate family) are dead or in prison. He is stuck in a cycle of negativity and taking it out on others because rather than dealing with his emotions when they come about he simmers until he bursts in anger or makes stupid impulsive decesions without thinking. He is a literal physical PSA of why getting money through means of hurting others doesn't make you happy. 
I used to do home service cleaning and babysitting for people with houses bigger than that. A gig I regularly did had a house that was much bigger than Michael's on the ocean and with a pool. They had a basketball court instead of tennis though. There were others too (this was in Florida by the way in case you are wondering). But I agree it is the rich lifestyle for sure."
GTAV,fqy83or,t1_fquaitl,1589744213.0,"Well they are despicable human beings but they were written to be not evil. Michael is a guy who remorseful dude who needs to learn that only he can make a change in his life which is why he loses his family, gets roped in with FIB, has Trevor issues and goes mental at times. He tried to run from his problems by betraying his friends and allies but the problem all along was himself and his undealt with trauma and regret for what he did to Trevor and Brad as well as Lester and the rest of their crew. Even when it boils to a head it literally takes getting beaten within an inch of his life and being left for dead by his friend and then being rescued by a pissed off Franklin. 
Franklin is trying to not end up in the same place as his mom and dad were  and he has already lost a relationship because of his stupid choices which is why he quit the gang. Problem is his family and friends all are a part of the gang or support the gang and constantly want him to do things for them because ""we grew up together."" He becomes more assertive as the game goes on. He's a mini Michael if Michael was loyal and more responsible in his younger years."

Women can have serious trouble having children and have tube pregnancies and can even lead to cancer. It is one of the most curable STDs if caught earlier.
