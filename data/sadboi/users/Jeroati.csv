Since that's the case many INFP men are quite timid and in general they have less confidence than many other types, so their dating life is kinda hard since men are usually are the one who goes after the partner. Also INFP men have the tendency to be a social outcasts, since they daydream more and probably dont have the same hobby as most men in general (unless u have a good sense of humor). This can lead to loneliness which triggers depression and anxiety. Thats why INFP has the highest suicide rate.

Also, I think women with INFP personality are cute, since theyre mostly feminine and good hearted. But still, i think men can still work with this personality, for example keanu reeves and joaquin phoenix both have INFP personality and they are adored by many for having a sweet personality, it all comes down to how u look and behave at this point."
