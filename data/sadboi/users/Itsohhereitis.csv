BipolarSOs,fqont6j,t3_gjvb8u,1589519792.0,"Bipolar single mom here. (Or I was for 4 years but now have an amazing partner.)

There’s 2 things. Firstly I have bipolar and had no choice but to be with my kids 24-7 and learn how to cope with my depression, mania, my baby’s’ tantrums, never having time alone, not sleeping, working, etc... so I feel like it can be done. A bipolar person should be able to take care of their child. 

However, sometimes I feel it would have been better for my kids if I could have been left on my own for a few hours/a day or so. It was incredibly sad and stressful and there were so many jobs that I started and quit during that time. I couldn’t handle anything outside of caring for my boys. I feel like sometimes it’s like you need a break from everything before you really lose your shit. I often need time alone in my room where I won’t yell at anyone or sob uncontrollably in front of my kids. 

It isn’t fair either way. Your partner should be helping more no matter how’s he’s feeling. But sometimes a break is nevessary for his mental health and from yours. It might be worse if he wasn’t isolating himself. (Just my 2 cents)"

For mom some easy meals to eat for her and babies. Or tell her you’ll make grocery trips for her, or pay for her delivery. Even just going over and cleaning house, or washing dishes/ bottles, is a huge help. (Although, the stay in place might make that hard to do.)

You have one crying for attention, the other needs to breastfed, 2 babies in diapers so you’re constantly changing them. Ya gotta take both kids to the grocery store, doctors appointments, emergency situations, etc, etc... 

But! My second child was one of the greatest blessings of my life. at first I wasn’t excited about having a second because of the way my marriage was. Now I cannot imagine life without his sweetness. The first year was excessively difficult, you’re learning still at that point. After that initial year I found it to be a great experience to have 2. They’re 6 and 7 now and the best of friends. 

I highly recommend a baby carrier. It truly saved me, because I could have hands free to take care of all the other things. I used an ergo but I’m sure there are other good ones out there.

I don’t have a lot of friends anyway, more like acquaintances. So I’m somewhat used to isolation. However my kids and my boyfriend are up my ass now, 24-7 so I actually miss my solitude. 

But anyway, try doing something that takes your mind off it. For me, it’s organizing, deep cleaning, drawing or painting, taking a walk or running up and down the stairs in my house, listening to loud music, going outside and enjoying the spring weather (even the rain, which smells so nice.) 

Honestly, right now I’m homeschooling my kids because of quarantine and I have to prep so much for it, that my mind is pretty occupied at the moment. However, it does frustrate me and make me angry because I thoroughly enjoy my time alone. I feel like I’ll never have it again. I dunno, with mental illness this is just rough. 

Hang in there. I hate myself, too. I’m sure a lot of people feel that way, but you have to just push it away. I still hate myself, but I don’t care that I do when I’m distracted.

Happy cake day, btw. :)"

Coronavirus,fl4fce1,t3_fmfa26,1584812336.0,"Does anyone know if corona can be transmitted through paper? My kids want to throw paper airplanes with notes to our friends that live next door. No one in the house has it, but I’m not sure if it would be potentially dangerous?"
EARONS,fl37z7g,t3_fm9tau,1584772152.0,I’m gonna say no on this. The Santa Cruz mountains were notoriously known to be a favored dumping ground of many murders. I don’t think EAR had any connection with the area.
