""As terrible as it was [to see our people die in the civil war], beyond the reach of the Resurrection Ships, something began to change. We could feel a sense of time. As if each moment held its own significance. We began to realize that for our existence to hold any value it must end. To live meaningful lives we must die, and not return. The one human flaw, that you spend your lifetimes distressing over â€“ mortality â€“ is the one thing...well, it's the one thing that makes you whole."" â€” Natalie Faust, Number Six copy and rebel Cylon faction leader, 'Battlestar Galactica'"

depression,f4xch4k,t3_dlfw2v,1571864321.0,"As someone who has felt this way many times over the past 15 years (and made several attempts), I would suggest four things:

1. Volunteer. Choose any volunteer opportunities that you like. Make sure you're not volunteering with any expectation of reward, such as friendships with the people you meet or work with.
2. Adopt a pet. Again, choose the species that you think you feel the closest to. Having someone that loves you so unconditionally will help.
3. Spend time in nature (hiking, canoeing, stargazing, etc). Try to spend at least some of that nature time outside in the sunshine.
4. Chat with strangers you come across in places such as a grocery store, or during hikes if you use meetup.com. These should be casual conversations, with no expectation of any kind of relationship with the person.

Speaking for myself, the first two things, especially, will create meaning in your life. Meaning is an artificial human construct, but it helps a lot in making us content/happy. The things I suggested won't make your depression disappear, but they will be as effective as, if not more than, ECT or similar techniques."
