He is skeptical of my love because during the argument 3 years ago I got mean. That prompted me to start therapy the following week. I did not insult his manhood.

No doubt it affected him in a big way. My point is it would have been helpful to have a discussion about it rather than being silent and letting resentments build. My low desire had to do with battling depression. I have since starting taking medicine and feeling a lot better.

Sex has completly stopped. I am now with the desire, he isn't. We had a big argument 3 years ago that caused him to put even more walls up. My anger is what put the nail in the coffin.
