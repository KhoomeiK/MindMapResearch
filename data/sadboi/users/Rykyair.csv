DeadBedrooms,f3mrjq7,t3_dhe9yi,1570991435.0,apologizing doesn't fix it action does both of you have your own faults both of you need to work together to fix them especially now. Its a mark of a unhealthy relationship when there's very little sex and one or the other or both partners aren't satisfied. And its a even greater mark that a relationship needs work when every conflict is a attack and then apology. both of you need to work on your communication and both of you need to work on your stress relievers. neither one can lash out when you feel targeted or are in a heated argument you should be able to talk and see both sides and come together for a resolution. adults don't brush emotions under a rug you should apologize and show you are learning that neither one of you is perfect and show that the case goes for you too. own up to your mistakes apologize and improve. duty sex isnt worth it and you should work together to build back your sex life I  your relationship so you are both satisfied.

mentalhealth,f3a926c,t3_dg8yky,1570764937.0,ik that feeling. I've felt it since I can remember honestly. you should see a therapist and see if you have anything (to me this sounds like heavy depression causing a lack of motivation but I'm not a doctor I only have my own experiences for reference)  I strongly suggest seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist and opening up about how and what your feeling. I hope you can feel better someday soon and this all becomes a memory that you can use to your advantage.
mentalhealth,f3a8svb,t3_dg8z2h,1570764726.0,of course you should talk to someone about it its always important to express yourself especially while a developing teen such as yourself. who it should be is anyone who will listen and care. online forums can help. but you should also talk to your parent(s)/guardian(s)  it might or might not be permanent but its not like anything has been diagnosed but you should still bring it up to your doctor and try and see a therapist if needed. ik that feeling all too well but I can't tell you your situation.

I've struggled with self expression and releasing my inner frustrations and sadness my whole life and yeah most friends I've had don't talk about the deeper things we all feel. and not everyone does for some reason. this is a big problem on the upbringing of children tbh. but you just need to find a way of self expression and maybe take the initiative of being the first to talk about the deeper things the inner frustrations you're going through because they are all normal and people can and most likely will agree with them and share the same feelings and views don't be afraid to be the outlier in the friend group that's willing to speak about it. you should also keep a journal to vent in and find forums and such to vent in and talk to others who might share your problems like this subreddit. and I hope you start feeling better soon and can appreciate the experiences you go through especially the harder ones ^^.

dating_advice,f3a770g,t3_dg91i7,1570763483.0,this all depends on the person and what you did. if they don't forgive you then they don't forgive you.

Your mother isn't a saint clearly but clearly something ruined her sense of humanity and empathy don't expect any different from her and her parents were probably the same or worse than her. most cases they were worse. all you can do is not let it get to you don't let others dictate what you feel for your body they don't live in it and unless you have a health issue you shouldn't be shamed for your body. fasting doesn't work unless you do it right and you shouldn't be doing it If you aren't in guidance by a professional or have the knowledge of the body yourself you are essentially telling g your metabolism there's no food go into survival mode and what happens with that is you gain weight when you finally eat because your body is afraid of lack of food resources  you can't fast and expect to just lose weight it isn't healthy and you can end up destroying your metabolism or you can end up gaining more weight than you had and even lost during the fast. if you're worried about your weight talk to your doctor it only happens through hard work. and i forget the medical term for this.  but don't let anyone dictate your life. find what's best for you and screw anyone to tell you no to it. diets don't work unless they are sustainable with exercise so again talk to your doctor.
mentalhealth,f38idzz,t3_dg3as7,1570736807.0,that's a great question what keeps me going is my gf and close friends and the idea that the pain I go through is nothing more than knowledge that I can use to help others. most days are hard sometimes harder than the last but so long as I have my support and my goal to help others idc what life throws at me. I've learned to cope with my pain by expressing and helping others with their issues and to have that support keeps that drive going. I've become content and at peace with who I am and what I go through.
mentalhealth,f38h6n4,t3_dg2vy6,1570736505.0,I can relate a lot of people can. I relate with the meds thing back when I would take meds. I used to always miss meds until I hit withdrawals. also the thing with excersize. I always still procrastinate on so much due to stress with school finding a job to pay for that and my phone bill. I put off cleaning and working out and eating and sleeping because I'm too stressed then I get depressed off of how stressed I am and depressed because I haven't done anything I HAVE to yet. But I'm trying ig. You need to find your balance make reminders and find your reason to do it then do it. its important to not only life but you.  YOU want to look good YOU want to be healthy YOU want to do better with your meds and YOU want to do better in your day to day life. its unrealistic to workout everyday first try once a week and once you find your groove with everything else in your life do 2 then do every other day. its unrealistic to pick up your meds while you are in your funk find your ways of getting out whether it be poetry rhyming punching a pillow and screaming into it whatever it may be find your way to get up and do the things you need to do not only for you but your life and everyone around you. find your time make reminders find your relaxer and don't rely on food to be it. ik anxiety is hard and ik you get stressed but everyone does you just need to find your relaxors And find your drive to get it done.
mentalhealth,f38dmu2,t1_f381y8b,1570735642.0,"I agree with this person. I feel like you should get multiple forms of help (therapy, hotlines, forums, etc.) and potentially get light meds to help you handle your disorders. I've been bullied before to the point I had to fight people if they saw me out of school and get teased and harassed in school and even jumped after school at times, so I can relate to that. Don't let anyone control the way you love your life or where you get your education stand up for it and speak up for yourself about the harassment if it starts again or continues. If your friends were truly your friends then they should apologize for the treatment you've received on the premise of plain accusations. You should go back if that's what you truly want but don't do it because you miss people who are there because they haven't shown the same level of care. Deaths in a family are always hard. Just remember youre not alone and the Internet can help you connect to others with the same experiences or who can relate or listen. think about making a book to release your emotions in or write whatever your feeling don't ever think you are alone ^^."

IK I'm well versed in the realm of psychology and I've been diagnosed with PTSD due to past traumas in home life school life and all the negatives that carried on into my life outside of the home. I no longer take medications rather use outlets to channel how I feel and use other methods to keep myself calm I'd rather not spend years messing with prescriptions and such there's too many issues that would need medication I just remember to do the best in keeping my moods stable and writing poetry and the support from my gf and friends help with that there are many people who need meds and who should have meds but I've found my own ways to keep myself stable and able to function without meds and don't wish to go back into meds because of the pit they left me in when I was on them and being switched with medicines and such.. the help is there I just wish to experience what I feel to have that perspective because its a part of me I embrace what I am and am trying to help others find their way to help. I understand the as you age it feels like its getting worse thing and that's normal when it comes to sleep disorders usually from what I've seen at least. I've found my support that keeps me going and I have found what keeps me at the very least partially sane. I'd rather live my life with the knowledge of pain then sleep with the bliss of ignorance.
