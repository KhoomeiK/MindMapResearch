EDAnonymous,fjnx54g,t3_fegiss,1583516094.0,"Thanks so much for sharing this! I totally relate to the macro tracking and love of the fitness world for how it can be seen as normal and admirable to be so regimented.

I've never had any interest in competing, but got more and more invested in fitness youtube/instagram to the point where I realized I was seeking/actually honestly achieving stage-level leanness without really knowing why. Now i have this weirdly alien body that I never even thought was possible, and swing between feeling proud of it and very mad and everything i had to give up for it without knowing. Even weirder is that I do all of this stuff alone without any gym buddies and without a trainer, so my only 'friends' are random fitspo internet ppl.

My husband is not into this stuff, and its put a real strain on our relationship and distance between us that I have all these obsessive routines. I even start resenting him and thinking he's lazy for not wanting to keep up with my disordered behaviours. I can see how sharing this with a partner could be both nice and dangerous.

I hope you can eventually get to a place where you can consistently prioritize having a family and building the life you deserve!!!

If you havent already, I recommend looking up kayla rose and maryscupoftea on youtube for their stories about coming out of the fitness world. I also really like The Appetite podcast for discussions on how to have a healthy relationship to fitness, and there are a couple of Tabitha Farrar's Eating Disorder Recovery Podcasts where she interviews people in the npc world."

1) your body expects to get glucose when you taste the sweetness of diet cokes and when it doesnt get any it intensifies your sugar cravings so you compensate the calories from another sugar source

2) it kills your gut bacteria and might only let the ones survive that are more linked to lower BMR

4) bubbles make me more able to pretend i aint hungry

fuckeatingdisorders,fhl8h77,t3_f3thzk,1581696964.0,"from what I've read, you might actually gain more by sticking to safe foods because you're never really satisfying your mental cravings, so you just keep eating, and keep obsessing about what you really want"
depression,fhim0o0,t1_fhijymv,1581627367.0,"I realize this isn't actually that instructive for someone else looking for how to get started. From my own experience, I'd say if I hadn't seen an actual psychiatrist by fluke, I would never have gotten the care I needed (mostly because of the cost- psychiatry is covered whereas therapy isn't for me here and my psychiatrist did my therapy with me under the guise of it being psychiatric appointments, she is an angel). So I would try to find a way to access higher levels of care than you might think you need because these can actually be more affordable and can open more doors. 

If you feel it's not worth it, think about what you would tell someone you love to get them to go. If it helps, you can also think of it as an experiment/learning process. I'm someone who collects random facts and I'm a researcher, and I tried to see learning stuff about my own brain as just another one of those areas where you can uncover stuff no one has ever known (this doesn't have to necessarily make you feel happy, but it can be stimulating in a time where you've removed alot of stimulation in your life, even if you see it as neutral information)."
depression,fhijymv,t1_fhigt38,1581626225.0,"TW sexual assault

I was sexually assaulted 3 years ago and felt like I was a danger to myself right after it happened so I forced myself to go to the on-campus mental health clinic. I happened to get lucky and there was a psychiatrist with an opening right then, so I was able to see her. Initially I was just there to get help through an acute response to trauma so I only saw her on and off (she was basically like we will wait and see if you have long term mental health consequences). 

Around the first year anniversary of it all and during the process of following up with police it really started to get to me more. I felt like I had been 'ruined' as a person by the trauma and that the world was full of pain and suffering. I felt like I could now see the world as it was, and that happy people were fooling themselves.

I was initially really resistant and felt like i needed to figure it all out on my own, or like somehow willpower my way out of it and if I couldn't then I should just accept my fate as a shit person? My psychiatrist told me this was me being reluctant to accept the 'illness model' (which I mention in my comment above). Even when I agreed to start CBT (I recommend Mind over Mood as a book especially if you can't access care), I didn't want meds because I felt like that meant I had failed. After doing a bunch of thought records (a CBT skill where you examine a particularly distressing event and weigh the evidence for and against your beliefs about it) that amounted to 'i dont have the energy to deal with this, im so tired and sad' and not getting anywhere for a while, I opened up to the idea that an SSRI might give me the energy I needed to take on the work. 

My treatment was especially important for me because I was planning to spend 3 months in Australia for a visiting research term alone (I'm in Canada). Having the CBT coping skills and boosted serotonin for that trip allowed me to really put myself out there in ways I would have thought were exhausting and not worth it, but allowed me to have so many experiences that reinforced the idea that I like myself and I'm someone with worth. After I got back, I slowly weaned off the SSRI.

Sorry for the novel! I hope this was helpful. I know I was very privileged to get the access to care and 3 months of sunshine I got and that not everyone has those."
depression,fhhxthg,t1_fhgi7fx,1581613876.0,"Yes, that's exactly what I meant by that last part! Your brain continues to make new connections for your entire life, and it's definitely not barred from remaking ones it had before. Check out this paper here:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259683/"
depression,fhelaxd,t3_f2qwaw,1581524793.0,"This was one of the most upsetting parts of my most recent depressive episode. Especially after a neuroscience grad student friend told me that your brain actively loses connections during depressive episodes, so it's not even just a feeling of getting stupider you can convince yourself you made up.

It's also really hard on people who have built alot of their self-identity around being sharp/focused/hard working.

I found the only way to really deal with it is to fully accept what you're going through as a legitimate illness that has complications like any illness, and that those complications have to change your expectations for yourself. Give yourself a break and be gentle when you need to. Also, try to focus on the other aspects of who you are. Chances are a friend or family member wouldn't say they like being around you for your concentration, and you wouldn't say the same for them.

Meds, sunshine, meds, nourishment, therapy, getting in some movement, and meds can all help to create that much needed mental space. For me, therapy was only cognitively possible with meds, but the stuff I did as a result of therapy helped me stop needing the meds in the longer term.

And the most hopeful part of all this is that those lost neural connections are not permanent, you have a whole life ahead of you to learn and grow and there is so much possibility in that.

Wishing you some peace!"

And thanks for saying that about my ability to question my thoughts. I guess some of the old CBT stuff stuck. I had really started thinking of myself as a nutrition expert in my own head and am now realizing how much of that is BS. Just gotta keep prompting myself to take a step back and try to find that perspective. Trying to keep reminding myself that I want a life bigger than my body and that I'm worth fighting for that."
EatingDisorders,fh0kg3c,t1_fgv4sn2,1581204813.0,"That's a great game plan. 

I guess my main source of hesitation right now is that without seeing the psychiatrist I don't have a diagnosis, I have a campus clinic GP writing ""GAD, ED? Please see"" on a referral form, so I don't know 'how bad i have it' and therefore what my approach should be. If these are less entrenched disordered thoughts that don't merit a diagnosis, am I safe with a more intuitive eating approach, or should I be forcing food in?

I'm sure this is partly me not wanting to gain weight and somehow convincing myself 'maybe they'll tell you you caught it early enough and they'll hand you a meal plan that puts you at maintenance calories so you gain zero weight'.....seems very likely haha

I guess I feel lost about how much to eat right now. I'm eating consistently to fullness, and am hesitant to go back to tracking my intake for fear of trying to push it too low once I see the numbers. I never skipped any meals or cut any food groups, but I bulked my meals up with alot of veggies and had become very focused on eating foods that were highly satiating, so I'm trying to switch these out for more starchy carbs and fats. Any other resources/tips welcome!"
EatingDisorders,fh0hpx0,t1_fgt7pfk,1581204025.0,"You raise a really important point - I could be making this more complicated than it needs to be right now. The Minnesota experiment is pretty compelling, and found some work on inducing 'activity-based anorexia' in rodents from listening to Tabitha Farrar's podcast that made me feel like it doesn't necessarily need to be 'that deep'. My training is in biology, so I might know too much about the 'greyness' of evolutionary psychology explanations for human behaviour to take a lot of comfort in them, but the idea that there was likely a predisposition and therefore some amount of biological inevitability for this pattern in me doesn't seem that unreasonable, and I think you're right that my focus should be in getting fed enough to think clearly before trying to really understand triggers (which I do think will be key for long term success for me).
