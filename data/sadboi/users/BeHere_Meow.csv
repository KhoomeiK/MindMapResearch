bipolar,fhzai6h,t3_f5khxr,1581994632.0,"If I had the opportunity, I would submit myself for a sleep study in a heartbeat. Psych meds are such a guessing game. Anytime I have an opportunity to get some hard facts science about my brain (GENOMIND genetic testing for psych meds was the best thing I have ever done in my 10yr journey with a bipolar diagnosis)
 I am jumping on that offer immediately because that data could shave months even years off of the guessing game and weird side effects from tapering on, and titrating off, all these different meds that may have never even helped on the first place.

I am also on both of these. 300mg lamictal (split 150 in Am and 150 in PM) and two 10mg Adderall as needed **but definitely before 4pm. I try to get up around 8am-9am and I take my night meds at 10pm. That's been working for me for about a year now...
The thing is-
No one's chemistry is the same, I also take Seroquel 25mg at night now and I have 0.1mg clonodine 2x a day for anxiety  (not to be mistaken for Klonopin) as a PRN and I  typically take just one with my night meds. 

I'm in a good space now
 
All that being said... I still don't think the details of my medication prescriptions would help anyone really because there's no way to know. 
Best of luck to you, thank you for sharing and I hope you find some good help, however it comes, so you can get that good good rest."
bipolar,fh0wgzw,t3_f10bxx,1581208297.0,"I know this feeling all too well... 
'The Artist's Way'  by Julia Cameron is an excellent excellent source of motivation and just like a kind of ""follow these steps and do these things and you'll push through this stagnation, I promise"" type of a book  that genuinely has helped me do just that. Achievable, attainable steps to stay in touch with your deeper self, artists self, child self, all the things that are golden and glow just below the surface level of heavy depressive episodes. I'm currently listening to The Artist's Way on Audible, and still haven't finished it. I think because her offerings for ways to motivate and support yourself are so profoundly simple and wicked effective and she offers so many ways to move through, I'm just pausing the book and then trying some of it out. 

Anyway, I'm not a writer. I'm not good English. But I hope I conveyed that I've been in this position, I'm actually in it now, and when I read your post I immediately thought about picking up where I left off in her book, and thought maybe passing it on might help (?) Best of luck. Wishing you gentleness towards yourself and a steady streak of goodness yourway."
bipolar,feknpy4,t3_epepgh,1579203858.0,"So talented and self aware and free with your expression. My mania feels wild and scary and fierce a.f superpower, but I never get any of it down on paper, not like this...
Please Hold on to the good good that seems to me, is a fundamental part of you!
I'm offering many thanks for sharing this and a little message of fangirl encouragement:
May you be safe and free from inward and outward harm and may you keep connected with your art and trust the strength of your vision and convictions. May you honor your gift for harnessing the experience of mania in a way that allows those feeling unseen, alone, scared, isolated, and outcast, a moment of connectedness and understanding and empathy.
For real, thank you."

Reading this and flowing down that stream with you, a perfect stranger... writing perfectly about being full up on emptiness... it was like having my trance mind hijacked by a frantic and beautiful butterfly crossing my glazed over field of vision... i was not expecting a supercharged super special moment of true conscious human connection today.

so. yus kweeen lezz party, cuz there's no time like the present to gift a moment to another

bipolar,f83uv0g,t1_f83j8vq,1574221579.0,"I've been taught something similar from my therapists- 
Pick a color and find 5 objects in the space with that color
- or -
The Five senses grounding technique:
Find/name 
5 objects you can see in the room (maybe of the same color or start with the same letter)
Find/feel 4 different textures near you
Listen for and identify 3 different sounds around you
see if you can recognize 2 distinctly different scents
And lastly, find One thing you can taste- and taste it!

Hope these ideas help


I like the senses technique because it takes some effort to focus on what I'm doing and buys me a little more time away from ruminating/anxiety thoughts."
bipolar,f83nobu,t3_dyudnm,1574216206.0,"I'm so sorry you're experiencing these! I suffered from the most debilitating headaches turned 48 hour migraines when I first started abilify. 
First dose was very little (per usual with any new medication) took it in the AM and when I was on my way to a 7pm night class i started getting an intense headache behind my eyes. Of course I was stuck in rush hour traffic so I couldn't even pull over- head pounding, stomach churning, the headlights and breaklights from the other cars was blinding- straight up searing pain like I've never experienced. When I finally got to class I was shaking and my legs felt wobbly and I barely made it to the bathroom before vomiting. Brain felt like it was slamming against my skull with every slight movement of my head. I couldn't drive back, I could barely stand up and walk. My partner had to pick me up and our roommate drove my car home. 

This first headache lasted through the night and into the next day. Called my doctor to explain, she said to take just half of the tablet for the next week and then to go back to taking the full one.
The headaches let up after that first week on the absolute minimal dose, and when I titrated back up to the normal dose, I had just slight headaches for the first day or so but nothing at all like that first experience. 
Spent two years trying to hone into the right dose of abilify (I was taking and still take Lamictal) and we just never found an effective dose... So we tried a different medication and dropped the abilify all together.

Hope this helps you- some people are more prone to certain side effects, just keep voicing your symptoms and tracking the severity of the side effects so hopefully your doctor will find a way to make it work for you. I know that for me it subside over time, but if you're ever feeling like it's not getting better fast enough, your doc should be presenting more options to you, other thann just white knuckling through debilitating migraines
I remember feeling so angry that my doctor didn't warn me about how severe the headache side effects could be... Take care! I hope things get better for you"
bipolar,f7xjexy,t3_dxshbr,1574060013.0,"You Are the Alchemist-

I wish I had that inspiration to just go for it. In hypomania I stay up all night, sometimes days in a row, just reading the stories of others. You journey through the desert is something I don't know I'll ever experience- I just finished reading the Alchemist  (and I thought it is a very short story, not many pages) I was proud that The Alchemist was the first book I've read in over a year. 

You are manifesting, in real time, one of the most relatable  allegories in our human experience.

Stay true. Stay safe. Stay connected. 
Thank you for sharing ❤️"
