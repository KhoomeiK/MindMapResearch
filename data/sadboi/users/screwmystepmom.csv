Don't get me wrong I actually like Horde zones, but Alliance just feels better color-wise.



They get Elwynn forest to start in which is beautiful. Then Westfall for a good new diversity with a nice western theme, then they get spooky duskwood. They also get Darkshore which is it's own theme in itself, then Ashenvale for a ""magical woods"" kind of thing.
