She's probably still being abusive in more subtle ways that you may not even notice.

She deserved it, and you deserve to be free of her abuse and heal from the trauma she inflicted upon you. It will only be possible to heal if she, the source of your trauma, is out of your life permanently.

I'm so sorry all these horrific things happened to you. I hope you can get closure and move on from the pain, and live a happy life. And since you're on this sub, make living your best life your revenge. Make her look on from a distance and seethe with jealousy at how amazingly happy and successful you became, all without her, _in spite of_ her. Not because of her. She can take no credit. Make her wish she hadn't been such a bitch so she could share in your happiness and success now. Make her writhe in regret.

But most of all, do it for yourself, and for your future loved ones who will be so overjoyed and grateful to have met you one day. Do it because you deserve so much better than what she gave you.

I know you can do it, because you did this. So I believe in you.

Edit: I just read the comments and realised you're married. Keep on being strong and courageous for her, and let her be your fuel to never let go of your anger towards your mother. This doesn't mean you need to be in a constant state of rage forever, you can be happy. But it does mean that you should never forgive her. You need to protect yourself from her. Don't let your guard down and let her sneak her way back into your life through your forgiveness. This is how abusers work. Don't let it ever happen.

Again, you did the right thing, be proud of what you did, don't ever feel guilty for it. She is the one who should be feeling the pain of guilt. I hope you and your wife enjoy the rest of your now, hopefully peaceful, lives together."

AmItheAsshole,foerccu,t3_g6zfpa,1587712133.0,">my close family has told me that the oldest doesn't know what he's talking about, and it's my fault the little ones don't remember their mother because I didn't take them to see her when she was in prison. They also told me that it's my responsibility to force them to meet her, even when they don't want to, because that's what's best for them and they shouldn't grow up without their mother. 

**ABSOLUTELY** ***DO NOT*** **LISTEN TO THIS.** It's bullshit. He's 9, not 3. Trust me, he absolutely knows what he's talking about. Kids understand *way* more than adults give them credit for. You're right for listening to him and not them.

NTA. 1000 times, not the asshole.

You are looking after these kids even though they are not yours, you are essentially a stand-in for their mother at this point if not literally their mother in every way except by blood, you have essentially rescued them from an extremely traumatic and dangerous situation. Their biological mother is a drug addict for fuck sake. If anyone calls you the asshole in this situation then they must be criminally insane.

Speaking from experience, I know how damaging it is to be forced to see a parent you want nothing to do with as a young child. It is actually traumatising. I still live with the repercussions of it today.

I had a financially and in some ways, physically neglectful father who pretty much ignored me and left me alone to do my own thing when I visited him once a fortnight on weekends.  When my mother found out he wasn't taking care of me properly (I didn't have a bed and slept on the floor of his office, amongst other things) she forced him to either provide me with what I needed or I wouldn't be visiting him anymore. He dumped me on my grandparents rather than providing me with a bed long-term as he would rather have lodgers sleeping in his 2 spare bedrooms, but at least I had my own room at my grandparents' house.

However, my grandmother was emotionally abusive and somewhat mentally unstable so I didn't want to stay with them either. My grandparents and father would argue a lot, very often within earshot of me. I was constantly walking on eggshells. 

Eventually, it reached a peak and I cut off contact with them altogether. I was 13. I had the full support of my mother in making that decision. She never manipulated me into not wanting to see my father, but when I was old enough to make an informed decision (9 years old IS MORE THAN OLD ENOUGH) she never forced me to see him either. Even as a preteen she left that decision entirely up to me. So I eventually completely cut him off.

The whole experience was harrowing. It has psychologically damaged me. I have been so stressed out literally my entire life from having insane family members, that it, in combination with other issues, resulted in me developing serious mental and physical health problems. I've been admitted to a psychiatric hospital twice. I've attempted suicide. I've lost *years and years* of my life that I will never get back. 

Please for the love of God, for the sake of these children, *let them make the decision* on if they ever see their mother again. Make sure they are informed, make sure they know what the consequences of either choice will be. Tell them about the possible pros and cons of seeing her or not. But let them ultimately be the ones who make the choice. It's *their* life, it's *their* mother, it's *their* mental and emotional wellbeing at stake. Don't listen to these gaslighting fuckwits who are telling you to force the kids into seeing an insane, criminally neglectful mother who could potentially cause them irreversible damage.

And well done to you for saving these kids. They are going to be grateful to you for the rest of their lives, especially that 9 year old boy since he is old enough to have an understanding of the entire situation. From the bottom of my heart, thank you, on their behalf."

I'm not entirely sure about making a _full_ recovery, I sure do hope so but I think _a_ recovery is more realistic at this point. I do still have some bad days here and there, when I wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all, get muscle pain and brain fog and as a result don't really want to do anything but stay in bed and sleep. 

I have noticed a pattern of the severity of my condition correlating with stress. If something stressful happens, even if I was otherwise having a good day with my symptoms, I instantly feel 10 times worse. This is significant, because I still have some pretty major situational things that I have to regularly deal with even though the chronic stress I mentioned before is over now. So if I get stressed, even from something relatively minor, feel worse and then as a result get stressed about feeling worse, it creates a pretty vicious feedback loop and my condition deteriorates rapidly. It can takes weeks to recover from those crashes. If I can go for long enough without it happening again though, then who knows, I might get better!"

I do also have ADHD and I take a generic extended-release ADHD medication which might be helping some of my fatigue symptoms, but also exacerbating others (such as heart palpitations and orthostatic intolerance). I stopped taking it at the start of my illness, because I was just too ill/tired for there to be any point in taking an ADHD medication to help me focus when I had no energy to focus on anything anyway. I couldn't even tolerate light or sound or even sit up in bed, so why waste my medication when it was pretty much going to be useless. After maybe about 2-3 months, when I was out of the acute phase and my illness became less severe, I started taking it again. I had a pretty bad reaction to it at first but now, I think it might be helping? It's hard to tell.

I did have some pretty severe pain, especially in the acute phase. At one point I was in so much pain on the entire left side of my body, especially the back of my head and my neck, that I thought I was going to die. I went to A&E, they didn't do much to help me, though. Just gave me paracetamol and basically told me to fuck off, lol. Around that time both the fatigue and the pain were so bad that I could not work or even look after myself, at least not very well. All the activity I could manage was 2 train journeys every week so I could stay with my partner on the weekends, and doing that would leave me pretty much bed-ridden the entire weekend anyway. But at least I got to see him. I don't know how I would've gotten through the worst parts of it without him.

Now that I'm feeling better than I was though, I can do quite a bit more than before. I still can't work, and I can't go outside (not that that matters anyway right now, haha) but I'm not completely bed-ridden anymore. I can do some *very light* activities around the house so long as I rest properly afterwards and for bigger jobs, take frequent (and often long) breaks. And by very light activity, I mean making a quick meal in the microwave for 5 minutes, or making a cup of tea. It's really *quite* a downgrade from working 4-hour shifts in the early morning every day, moving and unpacking heavy boxes in a retail job, and then walking the 2.5 miles back home. 

I can also now tolerate light and sound well enough to watch TV and sit in the living room with my family without the mere sound of their breathing making me feel like my head is being drilled with holes, lol. And on a good day, I might even be able to clean the bathroom or take my dogs for a walk without it killing me afterwards.

But I do strongly suspect ME/CFS. If I am correct in judging my own symptoms, I meet all of the diagnostic criteria for ME-ICC. 

I believe that my illness was triggered by a viral infection, probably Epstein-Barr that I caught from my partner when he was ill with mononucleosis. It's hard to tell if it was that alone though as I recovered from the viral infection (although not fully) and then about 16 months later I very suddenly, as in literally overnight, became ill with this CFS-like illness. Because of that almost a year and a half long gap I think that the actual trigger was an EBV *reactivation* caused by chronic stress, rather than the initial infection.

Now, here's the animal scenario. I have 2 chihuahuas. The younger one is a bit nippy and doesn't like strangers very much. My partner came over to stay, and the little chihuahua really didn't appreciate this very much. He kept yapping at my partner and trying to bite them. The little chihuahua is very affectionate towards and comfortable with me though, so I picked him up and held him at the same height as my partner with one arm, and reached out with my free hand to take my partners hand and pull it towards him. He sniffed my hand, then my partners hand, and could smell my smell on them. He was a bit more comfortable around them after this, especially when I was holding him. Later, after my partner and I had been cuddling in bed, my smell must've been all over them, because the little chihuahua came over to them and started asking to be petted. They were sat there cuddling for ages. It was so sweet!

This is why I love animals. I find them so easy to understand, and I think they understand me too."

You're just sitting with your kid for a few hours a day and helping them do the work like a TA would. People really have absolutely no clue what teachers these days have to do. The sheer workload alone, and how many hours a day they're actually expected to work. Hint; it's not 9-3. It's not even 9-5. It's more like 8-8.

I dunno. I see it from both sides. This virus probably originated from people eating animals, as most viruses do. But at the same time... It's also killing vegans just as much as it's killing meat eaters, and whether people triviliase it and make light of it or not with silly jokes, it's still almost as scary as ebola was. So...

I think there's value in the idea that these illnesses are actually indicative of another underlying problem. But also, when I look at some of these recovery stories, I think ""you probably never had that disease in the first place"". Maybe they were misdiagnosed or something. I don't know.

It just seems very suspicious to me (and I'm not the only one) that the name CFS just happened to be invented at the same time as a mass ME outbreak which was inconvenient for insurance companies, and also that we used to have such a detailed and specific definition of this illness and over time it has become less comprehensive and less detailed and more vague and mysterious, rather than the opposite which is what is supposed to happen when more research is done. It is almost as if the consensus on ME/CFS has gone backwards. It's very weird to me.

There are a lot of problems with what PEM is supposed to mean - different websites all describe and define it differently to the point that it's confusing. Who's definition are we supposed to use? Also, if you take a look through other different chronic illness subreddits, a lot of the people in them report having PEM, even though their diagnosis has nothing to do with ME/CFS.

I don't want to keep anyone ""out"". ME patients are a sub-group of CFS patients, because there are many different sub-categories within CFS. In other words, we're all CFS patients, we're just different kinds of CFS patients. I guess you could view ME as being one identified cause of CFS. The other causes haven't been found yet.

I will look at that, are there any other ME research groups you recommend?"
cfs,fkn2wey,t1_fkidt54,1584350981.0,"Thanks for taking what I'm saying in good faith. I'm only trying to help the community. I don't want to cause upset or harm. I just wanted to illuminate some things that people might not be aware of; they can make their own determinations about what they believe in the end. 

Hmm. I see your point about Canadian vs Nightingale criteria. Ultimately, if we understand and appreciate that categories are man-made for the purposes of serving some kind of social utility, then we can recognise that we can create whatever categories we want so that we can make them even more specific and useful. Having different ME and CFS sub-categories could be one way to do this, especially under the CFS umbrella. CFS has so many different potential causes. There is no disease, illness, disorder or syndrome that has ever had such vague diagnostic terms as CFS. It's really unhelpful for researchers. Imagine if we pooled any other fatiguing illness and CFS together in the same way as we do with ME and CFS? The same confusion about the cause of the illness would occur.

I just hope that this whole issue resurfaces and doesn't keep getting supressed and forgotten, more and more until no one is aware of it anymore. The founder of the Hummingbirds' Foundation for ME, Jodi Bassett, died in 2016. Dr Hyde has retired. Dr Dowsett died many years ago already, at the age of 92. I'm concerned that all this important information is going to die with them. That's why I shared it here, in the hopes that some people would be interested and start to pick up the slack that Jodi Bassett left behind when she died."
cfs,fkn22kq,t1_fkn1pil,1584349884.0,"I honestly don't know if I fit it or not because I have had no brain scans or biopsies. My experience has so far, in clinical terms, fit the biphasic disease process of ME, but that still doesn't necessarily mean I have it. I honestly hope I don't because it's incurable. The point of my post is not to gate-keep, or tell any one person that they don't have ME. I don't know which CFS patients have ME and which ones don't. That isn't the point. I just want to show people all sides so they can make their own determinations, and maybe we can make some progression in ME and CFS research by splitting the patients into more narrowly defined groups - including within the CFS group. That would help immensely with identifying what the underlying diseases actually are and developing treatments. 

I certainly will do some more reading, as I am curious about CFS and its possible causes. I want to learn as much as I can. If you have any papers that you can recommend, please link me to them. I will take a thorough look."
cfs,fkn1ahu,t1_fkn06dg,1584348839.0,"Because, if you actually take some time to comb through the research, rather than taking everything that ME/CFS organisations say at face value, you will find that ME patients have specific patterns of diffuse brain damage that the vast majority of CFS patients do not have. These patients are _consistently_ found to have been infected with a kind of polio virus. It crosses the blood-brain barrier and causes injuries to the mid-brain and brain stem, causing dysautonomia that affects cardiovascular function. This is why ME patients have such dramatically reduced levels of physical activity, because their hearts physically can't pump enough blood to sustain life at any higher level of activity.

These characteristics are not consistently found in the heterogeneous patient pools of ME/CFS and CFS research. Instead, a vast array of different events causing the post exertional fatigue are found. This includes mitochondrial dysfunction, physical or emotional stress or trauma, injuries and trauma such as whiplash, endothelial dysfunction, chronic infections (that are _not_ the ME enterovirus) that lead to autoimmune disorder, and many other things.

If you Google ""Benign Myalgic Encephalomyelitis"", you will find research papers that used homogeneous ME patient groups. This research goes all the way up to the late 90s and early 2000s. This research consistently finds characteristics in patients that are consistent with the Nightingale Definition and the Ramsay Definition of ME, which require specific patterns of hypoperfusion in the brain following an acute enteroviral infection, for a diagnosis."
cfs,fkn0bt1,t1_fkiltuv,1584347575.0,"I don't believe it is just lazy doctors, although that plays a minor role. It is mostly mis- and under-informed doctors who only have the CFS diagnosis to work with and don't even know what ME is. I have asked various medical professionals numerous times about ""myalgic encephalomyelitis"" and every time, they said ""what's that?""

Doctors should not just be testing CFS patients for known fatiguing illnesses. They should be testing them for anything and everything that could be relevant. CFS patients have been diagnosed with _so many_ completely different diseases after undergoing extensive investigation. That includes spinal and spinal chord injuries, such as CCI and AAI, and even diseases such as AIDS and cancer.

And if even after extensive investigation they still haven't found the answer, that does not mean that there is nothing wrong, or that the patient is not physically sick. It just means they haven't found the answer yet. In cases like that, perhaps a different placeholder label from CFS would be helpful, since I think we all agree that the name CFS is quite trivialising."

Some of the researchers of ME/CFS have even openly admitted that the ME/CFS they are studying is not the same ME that was first discovered in the 60s following an outbreak of what was then known as ""atypical polio"".

The WHO/ICD classification of ME under the code G.93.3 actually still calls ME ""Benign"" Myalgic Encephalomyelitis because at the time of it's discovery, there had not been any deaths. And it is still listed separately from CFS.

If you do a Google search for Benign Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, you will find research papers that are _actually_ about ME and not ME/CFS or CFS which is a completely different disease.

There are many, many institutions/industries that benefit from the great cover-up of ME. Insurances companies, the vaccine industry, the welfare state. They all benefit from being able to pretend that ME doesn't exist and instead pushing this nonsense diagnosis of CFS, which was invented specifically to be able to deny insurance and welfare claims for anything related to ""fatigue"". And the vaccine industry, which hails the polio vaccine as one of the best examples of a hugely successful vaccine, would have to answer to the fact that millions of people are still getting sick and dying from this enterovirus.

I just hope that the core of my message reaches all of you; that we actually have a far greater understanding of ME than most medical professionals will lead us to believe, and that there is still hope for us.
