Health is politics. Actions, policies and ideologies will have effects in health. As an example: changing the gas price can lead people to change behaviours and it is going to have an effect on their health, be it through reduced car usage and reduced polution or now it's going to be pricey to rural communities reach a healthcare service, and many other consequences.

Saying that your ideology is health is vague, as there's many ways health can be affected and ""measured""/viewed. That's what I'm questioning, who (and how) his health ideology is going to benefit?

As I've said before, I can understand his quote in the present, as no one can be against health (be it for some demographics or for everyone), but in the long run, I can't see how a discourse like this can be beneficial.
