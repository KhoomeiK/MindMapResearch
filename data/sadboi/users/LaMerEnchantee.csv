It genuinely upsets me when I see fellow borderlines mistreat someone and then blame it on their disorder(s), because I remember what it was like doing the exact same thing when I was younger.  Once I learned to accept that it's okay to be wrong and to apologize, managing my symptoms and relationships with people became so much easier.

ptsd,foiom37,t3_g7g1zf,1587792187.0,"I have been diagnosed with both, although I can't say for sure if my BPD is a result of the PTSD because I can remember a lot of symptoms being around since my teenage years.  It can absolutely get rough when the symptoms overlap.  For me, the main reason behind my PTSD has it's anniversary in January, so the emotions and potential triggers, coupled with my intense emotions from my BPD, can become overwhelming.  


As a result, I've had to learn how to reach out to people I love and trust, and how to place my own safeguards to minimize episodes or try to avoid them together.  For me, I like to let my support system know that I'm about to be entering a rough part of the year, and if they are able to, to please check up with me and make sure that I'm getting my basic needs met.  I also prefer to keep busy with things that I enjoy to minimize downtime where I get lost in my thoughts and emotions, so think about what activities you like to engage in how you can bring the people you trust into those things.  These are just a few things that help me out, and it's a process I've been working on for the past 10+ years.  


As for tips for coming to terms with it, it's honestly been a lot of time, patience, and reading.  In my early 20's I used to frequent the Something Awful forums, and that was where I first heard about BPD, and let me tell you, the things people said about us were AWFUL.  So, when I was officially diagnosed with BPD a few years ago, I cried my eyes out for days because I knew the unfair stigma that would now be attached to me.  You're going to struggle with your diagnoses, and that's okay.  Be patient with yourself, do as much reading as you can to better understand your conditions, and remember to pay as little attention to the willfully ignorant as you can.  You're more than your disorders.
