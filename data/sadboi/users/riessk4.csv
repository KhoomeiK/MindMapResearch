But whenever I praised God and went into worship and prayed whenever I felt temptation, I noticed that I went a lot longer without giving in. I feel like not thinking about it at all, and if an urge pops up, just say the word Jesus and force yourself to change your thoughts to him."

I’ve been putting it on every night and it made my eyebrows start growing in again. Some people use it to make their brows thriller/fuller and some use it to help stimulate regrowth! It works for a lot of people but it depends on how long you have been pulling for. If the follicle is more damaged, then it might not work as well, but it is working pretty good for me!! A lot of people say that black or Jamaican castor oil works better than regular castor oil but I’ve never tried the regular type. If I were you I would just put it on every night before bed and see if you start seeing results after a few weeks!"

NoFapChristians,f1yhnho,t1_f1ycuak,1569816498.0,"I like to think of it like this: we were created to reflect Jesus and to praise God with our lives. When we live a life pleasing to God, the goal shouldn’t be to get anything out of it. The goal is to praise Jesus, to point others to him, and to let his glory be revealed and shown through the work he has done to help you overcome your struggles. Yes, God blesses us and he is faithful, but our focus while overcoming shouldn’t be an expectation of blessings, but instead, seeking and looking forward to praising him. No sin can separate you from the love of God, and God is not an unforgiving god who will abandon you if you get stuck in a cycle of sin. He will meet you where you are and he will help you fight through this only by his mighty strength. I’m praying for you. Fight the good fight and finish the race with Jesus."

selfharm,ey4hrty,t1_ey4fpbi,1566792763.0,"I totally understand. I’m 16 now and I wasn’t raised in a Christian family. I was abused my whole childhood, struggled with depression and self harm, and basically hated God and didn’t want anything to do with religion. I was so overwhelmed with everything that I was going through and wrote my suicide letter in 7th grade and planned to take my life the next week if things didn’t get any better. A day before I was gonna take my life, I was invited to church by a stranger, who happened to be the youth director, and I told her about all my struggles and all I was going through and she was SO accepting and helped me without judgement. She invited me to stay at her church, and that church was different. They welcomed me in without judgement, and helped me. They were the only real family I had. My life was changed then and I accepted Jesus as my savior. I used to think that religion was just a bunch of strict rules and a mean God, but the truth is that Jesus hated religion and he just wants a relationship with you. Praying doesn’t have to be organized or planned out, it is just saying whatever’s on your mind and just talking to Jesus like he is in the same room with you, because the thing about God is that He is always there with open arms ready to take us back- no matter how far we’ve gone or the hurt we’ve been through. And the thing is that he takes us back the second we ask. He loves you so much that he died to know you and to have a relationship with you. Just ask him to come into your heart and he will welcome you with open arms. He changes lives and like that song says, he gives hope to the weary, rest that endures, and there’s no sorrow that he can’t heal. Your never to far to be forgotten and he will meet you where you are. I’m praying for you and if you want to talk or anything about struggles, faith, prayer, Jesus, or anything, you can always message me."

TrueChristian,ewahcom,t3_cng7wi,1565243711.0,"I am a Christian who has struggled with suicidal thoughts, depression, and self harm. From what I’ve read, I would take your daughters suicidal action seriously. When we stay home from events, like the shower, it can be because we are overwhelmed or do not feel like being around family. Depression is like having a HUGE weight holding you down that makes it feel like it takes so much effort to move, and at the same time you feel numb from everything. This is Sometimes why we say we don’t feel well or feel sick when we have to go places or do things with family. If she is depressed, family events probably aren’t her first priority. For me, my family is a big reason why I was so depressed. Family events were so draining to me because i they overwhelmed me and I felt like no one cared about me. I’m wondering if she is overwhelmed with everything going on or maybe she feels alone and like no one cares because of the other foreign students living with you at the moment. Even maybe seeing that you didn’t call an ambulance because you didn’t want to scare the other girls, hurt her, because to her that may have seemed like you cared more about them than her and her safety. She might feel like you care about them more than her. For suicide attempts, there comes a point where we might do anything to get out of a situation that is overwhelming and after so many stressful things build up, sometimes we have a breaking point where we try to take our own life because we want the pain, frustration, misunderstanding, depression, etc. to end. I hope this makes sense. I would maybe look into getting her into the hospital to stay for awhile because her medication alone might not be enough. She may need to have therapy or inpatient. I know this may be so confusing and scary to you, but please don’t take it out on her or think  that she is sabotaging everything. This is a cry out for help and she needs you to be strong for her. I’m praying."

I know what it’s like to consider suicide because it feels like your life won’t get any better, and we don’t want to die, but we are tired of how life is going and want it to get better. It’s really difficult. I don’t know what your circumstances are, but for me, I’m in an abusive home so it hurts when people try to say to keep living because your parents care. I know my parents don’t care about me, and it hurts. But since almost no one cares about me, I try to keep living for other reasons. For my dog, for someone at my church who is kind to me. They don’t have to be big reasons. So you can drink coffee again, feel the warmth of the sun on your skin, so you can listen to your favorite song, not big reasons at all. But when you don’t want to live for that reason anymore, replace it with a different reason. I can’t take my life because I will never abandon my dog and let him live with my abusive parents alone. He doesn’t know my struggles, but he loves me and I am his whole life. Just small reasons can make a big difference. I’m praying for you. ❤️"
