relationship_advice,f0e852d,t1_f0e32hn,1568564464.0,The first 2 years were baby related- the next year  was me instigating and getting nowhere - the last year has just been resentment- I wouldn’t be interested even if she tried a little bit.
DeadBedrooms,eygjmv3,t3_cwxkyq,1567070997.0,"we are the same, except  with 3 kids-  she got  her kids every 5/7 years,  with little sex in between.
We still live together as a couple, as soon as the kids are old enough I’m moving out.  I’m not the cheating type, and there’s no way I want to miss a single minute of the kids growing up, so I’m stuck.  I’m 41, youngest has just turned 3.  She might want sex again in 2 years?? No idea, it’s a long time without even a hug or a peck on the cheek."
depression,exzsn7j,t3_cpidz8,1566670329.0,"I didn’t properly realise I had depression until someone else started using my ‘safe space’ (my moms garage)  it’s been ‘my’ garage since I was about 10,  (40ish now)and even when I moved out I still use it daily. Then my mom got a lodger and I had to share it with him, oh boy did it mess me about.  
 Reading this post  really helped me."
