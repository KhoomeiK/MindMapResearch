Parents of the world right now must be really noticing how they need free day-care a.k.a teachers more than their thought. It's just torture, it's always been.

This being said is only torture cause you only need ONE awful kid to ruin it.

If students were screened and we had good behaving students only ..I wouldn't complian.. some parents actually educated their kids and they're a blessing to teach. I'm forever grateful for these parents and kids, not only as a teacher but as a citizen 

The bad students should be sent to other classes with other teachers that earn x5 normal wage"
SuicideWatch,fr23re0,t3_gm6m8g,1589830645.0,"Currently being under investigation for something that I didn't do at all, odds are on my favor I'd say but prospect of going to jail and/or losing my job, thus effectively having to return to Mexico cause I'm on visa torture me, plus the trauma of being wrongfully accused is enough on itself, fucks up your reputation etc. I don't wish it to anybody.

Then there's the pssd, my dick has been numb for months now after one antidepressant pill.. orgasms doesn't seem the same at times, though I know they can vary.. libido could be better.. this pill fucked me up badly and seems recovery will be slow if any at all, I wasn't warned of this, of course.

Then this pandemic has me isolated from everyone, then there's depression and jealousy.. I feel I never met the woman of my dreams and I get jealous some relatives did and sometimes I feel I coulda been him

Then some more bullshit, a break up that hurted like hell cause I love her but her ex is w psycho bi don't need in my life (she coulda told me how psycho he was before) also leaving a gf in Mexico that now she's dating someone else I miss her at times too

Always being shy. My father killing myself when I was young.
Overall feelings of nostalgia and being suicidal for 15 years now.

Right now is this investigation that's pushing me to the edge though, I feel bullied... Ironically if I was to do it people may think I did it out of guilt! Lol. I'd do it out of being bullied.

The pssd sucks enough to want to do it TBH, but I got this on top, and on pandemic times.

Is just too much at times. Been looking methods these days.

Sometimes is just like ""ok, did my best but seems existence wants me out"" or something. I hate being suicidal tbh and I think it ridiculous that people will do it for the stupidest things too, like ""I don't have a gf"" or ""I feel lonely"" or ""my mom hates me"" or ""I feel the blues"" but it is what it is.

Honestly anybody that's not even 25 and wants out has no idea, but that may just be me.

OP: for whatever's worth: I've seen some ugly motherfuckers dating beautiful ladies.. like really ugly. Beauty is indeed in the eye of beholder. I got also acne scars and feel ugly at times but that's not a problem to me anymore.

Oh I also have this feeling in my teeth after having calculus removed that makes me wanna do it at times. But yeah it's nothing compared to the trauma of being falsely accused of a crime to the police.

So that's my answer. I probably won't do it despite all though, cause unlike the person accusing me, I actually love life very much."

Oh, and raise their wages! They think their kids misbehave? They should see them with other kids! In short: maybe there'll need be a world wide teacher strike.. society will collapse..and not cause kids won't learn but cause parents will go crazy without a break! As they are now like this woman you speak of.

I mean, really: who do we as society want pay more: a senator that sits on his ass all day or someone that gives us a break from our kids? Bingo.

Three: Welcome to the life of relationships.. son, it's a bumpy road ahead 

Four: Yes it's more difficult when they're nice

Five: expect feeling horrible afterwards you'll see her cry and you'll basically need to get out of there instead of comforting her, horrible! It's like killing someone kind of a mini-death

Six: you may go back with her after the break up cause you'll actually miss her and you'll wish you didn't make her cry. You ended up with her again but there's some resentment . she's happy but doubts you now...  (is better for any relationship if you never made her cry to begin with evidently)

Seven: after some time the same reasons that made you break up with her first will appear and you'll break up again and make her cry again, another mini-death but less intense this time

Eight: You'll feel bad but suddenly free and will start flirting again.. curiously few girls pay you attention now that you're single again, it's a mystery of life

Nine: Staying friends with her will be hard

Ten: she will date again before you and you'll feel lonely and may regret your decision for a while... Except you're 15 so you'll be better off than most adults breaking up

11: She sounds nice.. I'm suspecting she probably is starting to bore you.. it's hard to find that one that will be funny/interesting and nice too

12: Do as you must.. breaking hearts must be one of things that suck the most in life.. I hate it!

He may just not be ready for committing with you, a.k.a exclusive relationship. If that's the case you can either keep playing the sex call or just walk away cause I don't think friendships endure sex. Not by common rule I think. Don't regret.

You guys may end up splitting in the future but maybe you'll grow old together.

I'd say father's teach us males the practical stuff in life, the ""how"" very important!! 

If you think your dad sucks at being a mentor do like I did and find a mentor or mentors.. they can be authors, etc.. they can be dead..is better of they're alive and you ask them stuff/for their perspective of course.

As you grow older you may find out you actually like your dad more or maybe not.. if you do want to share stuff with him make sure you like said stuff.

You can always ask him: ""hey, dad you ever feel like we don't really know each other?"" You can call him by his name instead of dad.. it's up to you

Anyway, you sound 'normal' and your dad kind of too.. sometimes ""Christianity"" gets in the way.
