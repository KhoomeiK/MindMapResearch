I don’t have many but before me and my gf (ex) got together, she waited for me after school one day and there’s a forest opposite our school so we were walking down the alley to get to it and we started pushing each other/trying to trip each other up like we normally did and we both ended up on the floor bringing each other down just landed in a pile together..She put war paint on my face with mud and then I did hers and I took our first selfie together. (Both extremely camera shy) but I wanted to have that memory of us forever and she smiled for the photo then mocked me saying I was gay lbut she knew that’s why I took it.. I don’t have the photo anymore cos of the vivid memories it brings but I’ve kept a (really bad) drawing of it that I did all those years ago because the moment meant so much to me so if you do end up wanting to include this into a tarot deck somehow

Fast forward a couple months I got to stay at her house and when she met me off the bus we were walking to hers when she started taking me across a massive field and I was like where tf do you live. I didn’t know but she had already walked across the field on her way to meeting me to hide a picnic basket and I was lost for words when I saw it, it gives me chills thinking about it. (Not important but the picnic basket was really expensive and bought as a wedding gift for her mum and had been kept strictly for display purposes only which my gf said was a monumental waste of such a gorgeous basket) 
 ❤️
+her mums homophobic and we revelled in the fact we were using the basket against her wish as well as being together. My gf was sick of her mum having nice stuff just to be stored away and not be used like why spend so much money on something that has a purpose and not use it? It’s to make a statement of wealth or whatever. So us having a picnic with this basket was her making a statement to her mum that she loved me and her mums op on that could go suck a fat dick

The first night I stayed round hers her mum made me a bed on the floor and was deadly serious about me staying on their but bc we were so convincing she actually believed/trusted that we wouldn’t share a bed ahaha
The next morning we both made a fat English breakfast together and attempted to make pancakes.

In her words, She broke up with me because my all out &open fucked upness that exists because of my past ‘reminds her of her own fuckedupness’ in hers that she’s never really even told a soul about and has repressed and denied for most of her life and I think I act as a trigger for certain things going off in her head For whatever reason, I think it’s because this thing in her head tells her she can’t have what she wants and she fully believes it’s threats so apparently it’s just best that we don’t speak anymore. We managed to stay friends for a large amount of time which I’m extremely grateful for and I think we still are friends we just don’t talk anymore and I’m hoping it’s not going to be like this forever. I think it sucks for both of us but I like to believe that if she did have the choice to be able to be with me in the way she wants then she would.. so either she doesn’t want to or she doesn’t even have the choice. I may never know. 

Idk how helpful any of this is to you but it’s been helpful to me to get this out so thank you for prompting this out of me with your post I really appreciate it ps this whole thing you’re doing is amazing I’d definitely buy a deck can’t wait to see the others 

Love"

If they don’t give you anything ask why and report it back to us, if they’re just being tits then threaten to take them to court over not giving you pain relief if it’s still really bad and show them how much pain your in and demand to see your doctor/surgeon. Should make them take you seriously. The pain will subside eventually though so stay strong. I don’t mean to sound patronising or silly but try and not focus on it and instead focus on getting through this pain. You will get better ❤️ Not really religious but will pray for you tonight to God, the moon/ the universe whatever force is out there and I wish you a healthy and full happy pain free as much as possible life. 
Ps rod snapping is a real thing it happened to my mum just take care in the recovery stage take it easy and don’t pick heavy stuff up/do heavy work and you’ll be okay 💕"

actuallesbians,feia1i9,t3_epasoq,1579133649.0,"Also my dads the most homophobic person I know and after a year or 2 he came round to it, he accepts me, loves me and respects me and I respect him back by not being in his face with my gayness, He said he doesn’t like it so he doesn’t want to see it which i guess is fair enough. He disowned me when he found out I was gay which I expected cos he always told me growing up he would disown me if I was a “dirty dyke” ahaha I came out at 15 and boom. But like I said he came round to it, it’s sort of something that’s not spoken about anymore which I like anyway because what’s to talk about ? Nothing."
actuallesbians,fei9hs1,t3_epasoq,1579133290.0,"Tell em straight, just have this discussion with them and say like look I’m gay and I respect you all have your own opinions etc but can you respect me by not be saying stuff like that cos it’s offensive. If they carry on then you don’t need them type of people in your life. 
I had a lot of crap being younger but now I’m an ‘adult’ I just told them straight if they love me as family then they need to love me for me and being gay is a huge aspect of my life but it doesn’t define me, still the same person, just a lil bit more sparkly;) best of luck
Also about your cousins making snipey comments or whatever like you could either ignore it as much as possible (wouldn’t recommend) or just make some sarcy comments back depending on their age and stuff if it’s just immaturity then be silly/playful back. my nephews call me gay all the time and I think it’s brilliant cos they think it’s offending me and it isn’t, though I do remember a time when it used to upset me."

You got me 😂😩

I’m 21, and all 3 of my ex’s are ginger lmao, first one we met at school, second one in 6th form and the 3rd I met when I was working behind a bar last year. 

I don’t really have advice as but I sincerely believe that stuff happens when you aren’t looking for it to happen. It doesn’t work if it’s forced, and it also wouldn’t be as special imo which is why I personally stay away from dating apps etc.

Idk I guess just be active, do you. Live your life, and mrs right will make an appearance eventually"
