 I work with mental health patients and prior to, I was very lax about drugs. Now I can't imagine taking some random thing for this exact fear of entering and never leaving psychosis. It's terrifying to watch people go about their life in another reality. I'm really glad you found your way back!

The other thing is, about antidepressants, if one worked for you in the past and you stopped using it, if you try the same one again later, it won't work. I don't know why this is, or what mechanism makes the drug not work anymore, but it's a pattern I've seen at the hospital. If the antidepressant works, then never stop taking it. (Otherwise you run the risk of loosing it's effects.) I don't know if this is scientifically backed up, but I've seen a few dozen patients who attest to this effect occuring.

I don't know too much about psychosis, but if yours was drug induced, doesn't it mean you would have to take drugs to bring on psychosis again? Or is it that once you get it, your automatically susceptible to any little trigger?

I think you need to get some Cognitive behavioral therapy - learn some grounding rules. Your way of thinking has been altered and a bit of help will get you back on track.

askdrugs,fqk5ulw,t1_fqk5lpr,1589420735.0,"Cocaine is ""slightly"" more euphoric - lol, that's kinda disappointing 😂 

(this one dude on YouTube describes the meth and Adderall highs as being undifferentiatable in his opinion, so youre probably right on that one!)"
psychnursing,fqk5kyu,t1_fqk49ih,1589420585.0,"And that's amazing you bought 60! Must've cost a pretty penny!

There has to be a way to do this! 
I'm not lettin those books go to the same fate!

Somebody, give us guidance!"
askdrugs,fqk58ru,t1_fqk2fuh,1589420400.0,"What do you mean when you say 'high'? Is it anything like high from weed? Or other drugs? Or is it like some other commenter said, that feeling the effects of Adderall *is the high!"
askdrugs,fqk519y,t1_fqjyzod,1589420291.0,"I think you're right! There's this guy on YouTube who's done every drug on the market (probably) and he was saying something like he can't differentiate between an Adderall and a Meth high. 

Lol, if there's any truth to that - if 69mg Adderall is what meth is like...I don't see the hype. 

He could be talking strictly about IR - and in that case, wouldn't  a 20mgXr = 10mgIR +(coated 10mgIR) // this 60mgXR would technically be 30mg IR.

Does that make sense? 
Idk, in the end, 40mgXR ain't doin it for me!

askdrugs,fqk4fov,t1_fqk0riz,1589420001.0,"Bleh, that sucks for me. Yeah, 60mg is weird for me. Like my heart goes crazy (though nothing more than 90bpms), but mentally I'm done for the day and desperately need a nap (which ends up lasting 8-9 hrs). (It's for the better I guess!) 
Thanks for your input! 

Tho imma give 4pills a shot and see what happens. Maybe 5. I just wanna see if anyone's done it before and if it's worth it."
askdrugs,fqk3uz5,t1_fqjzuu3,1589419718.0,"Hah - the pellets are all one colour, unfortunately. 

Imma gonna see if I can set IR for myself - since I'm working 12hrs and the crash from the 20mgXR (6am) hits right around 12-3. I work 7-7. 

Would the doctor give an IR in that case to get me thru the crash? Lol, don't wanna burn myself with that one."

Psychosis,fqaapys,t1_fqa9mgy,1589215822.0,"It's okay to cry! That only means your human.

I work at a psyche floor, and this new patient ended up committing suicide the same day. From the little I saw of him, he was very nice. I didn't really do much for him (asked him throughout how he was doing, could I get him water or anything) and he still thanked me sincerely, which got me to thinking that if he was thanking me for doing nothing, that means his nursing staff literally *DID* nothing. 

Well he hung himself, and because staff didn't check up on him, he was blue in the face when they found him. I was helping a patient right next to his room. (Wtf). And a few days later, he died in the ICU.

I still occasionally tear up knowing I was so close to have changed his fate. Depression, or whatever illness he was struggling with, was real. There's a stigma that ppl fake illness to get a fix of drugs or a bed on the psyche floor. I think this guy was similarally stigmatized.

Rest now, in peace."
