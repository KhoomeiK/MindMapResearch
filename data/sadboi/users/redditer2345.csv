(for females: better do not take more than 10 mg in one turn, because your testosterone will rise and you will get male body hair, permanently.)

(for males: 10-20mg in one turn is ok, do not take again until you are exhausted, maybe once in a week) 

I was talking about common zinc glucnate. Other forms like acetate or citrate are different, but can be tested."
