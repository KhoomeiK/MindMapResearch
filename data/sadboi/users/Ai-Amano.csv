Rats show love and play with you and are affectionate individuals, with their own personalities. It may be a nice pet to have, if you have littles too, and they sadly don’t live very long, but for that you don’t necessarily need to have a commitment that’s too long.

Ps: check for allergies tho, people can be allergic to rats too"

SuicideWatch,fp4ox7s,t3_gb9qa2,1588303863.0,"Hi pal, if that’s ok I’d like to express just a personal opinion.
First of all I’m sorry if you’re having difficult times, I may understand a bit.
About your friend, I think that a sometimes, when facing difficult things like a friend that has suicidal thoughts, someone may not be able to behave in the right way. He can be uneducated on the topic maybe, or confused on what to do and he may have done choices that hurt you. For that I’m sorry that happened, but I wouldn’t give up on him, if he knows that you’re going through this especially, because he can be an ally. I feel like he may have talked about your thoughts with other people because he could be feeling powerless and confused; if he really didn’t care about you I think he wouldn’t have told anybody, tbh. Those people may be able to help you, I know it sounds really invasive, but it can be a good thing, actually.
If you find that this person is toxic to you and makes you feel constantly unhappy because of his action then I don’t condemn your choice, I just wanted to voice how he may be feeling, because I’ve been in his place and I felt unsure on how to act.
That said, I hope you’ll feeling better soon, I know it’s just from a random person on the internet but seeing how you expressed yourself I’m sure you’re a great person and I wish you all the best things in the world 🌸"

They have lower payment options for people who can’t afford full payments and you can try it for some days before you commit; you can easily change therapist if you feel like it and you match with your therapist based also on what you look in them, like maybe if they’re religious or not, lgbt expert or not... stuff like that. You can do scheduled video calls and/or chat, and you have licensed therapists, you can easily look them up if you want.
Since your gf can’t go to therapy right now it could be an option. Tell her to try, she can cancel anytime of course, but at least could be a start.

I don’t recommend to bong in the rat room while letting them free roam in another room at the same time because
1) you could need to be mentally alert if things happen -like, my boys are true mischief masters and I can’t be relaxed when they out- but i could be wrong, it really depends on your reactions and your rats behavior, so I don’t wanna be harsh about it.
2) air could remain “polluted” for a long time

When I adopted my boys I smoked cigs in another room for a couple days but then I just quit, for them and health reasons, and if I have a smoker friend over I move the boys into another room for the night, or more, and make the friends smoke over the window or not smoke at all :) just my opinion, hope it helps!"
