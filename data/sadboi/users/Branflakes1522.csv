I’d expect a majority of the population to know who Lionel Messi and Christiano Ronaldo are, even if they don’t watch soccer. Why? Because they’re some of the GOATS of soccer. Same goes for Michael Jordan and Wayne Gretzky. They’re some of the GOATS of their respective sports. And then, naturally, there’s recognizable names for respective regions. 

After giving those examples, you’re probably expecting me to say that Tom Brady would, or should a globally recognized name. But the fact is, American football isn’t that big of a sport. And even in countries where it is, like Canada and Australia, they have their own set of rules. Australian football is fucking brutal. Multiple people have died playing it because they don’t wear protective gear and it’s legal to fucking yeet yourself at the guy or deck him to tackle. 

Baseball, hockey, basketball, they’re all global with consistent rule sets to what we see in America.

I know that we have a great system of checks and balances in place to prevent the President from having complete and total control, and I also know that the Trump administration has gutted that by firing people and not replacing them, firing inspector generals whenever he’s accused of something, cutting the one GOP senator that dare oppose him out of the picture entirely, and giving Mitch McConnell a position that allows him to silence any attempt at disobedience against Trump."
