entomophagy,fpwy5fb,t3_gfuzzr,1588972114.0,"I would ditch the oat bedding for one, it molds very easily and its impossible to separate eggs and the smaller worms when its moldy. Oats are also not a great food source, stick with things that have moisture in them: carrots, raw potato slices, celery, cabbage, etc.  I would switch to a wheat bran for their bedding. As for your die off, thats not abnormal. Especially if the ones that died are the ones you started with (ie bought from a store) they may have not had access to food/moisture for some time. Could also be mites, they will eat little holes in the exoskeleton of the worms pretty easily. Adult beetles\* are a bit harder for the mites to get through. Could also just be normal die off, 3 week of larvae are still pretty susceptible to dehydration, hunger, and possible genetic issues (out of 100 eggs lain, 100 will not become beetles)

If this is a family member that holds great importance for your spouse, have her/him set up a time in a safe space to have a ""come to jesus"" about what BD really is, (when i talked to my parents, i used a list of famous people that have BD just because thats how they work ugh lol) and how medications as well as counseling impact it. 

If the family member is not much aside from a formality/you're in touch because xyz people expect you to be, please speak to your spouse about cutting ties or creating a healthy distance, especially since this is now getting your children involved in a way that is unnecessary and potentially scarring. 

I have a 5yo. My parents are still nervous and visibly embarrassed when I bring up my BD1. My sister in law wont let me be alone with my 5yo niece because I'm ""unreliable and dangerous"" due to my diagnosis. I'm subsequently snubbed any time I'm in their town for work.
