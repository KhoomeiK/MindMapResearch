Story time:

My Mom was the oldest of three, and had always known that she was the reason my Grandparents got married,  so she never questioned it.  She looked different than my Aunt and Uncle, with (what I'd call a ""Roman Italian"" series of features: aqualine nose,  dark hair, classic Italian 'Nona' body) but her siblings didn't, and never learned the truth until my Grandfather died: she was the product of an affair between her mother and her married Boss at the place she worked,  and when the boss wouldn't leave his wife (and two other daughters!) my Grandmother married her ""second choice"" to avoid the scandal.  Growing up my siblings and I were always made to feel like we were 'third string' and 'less than', and my Mom treated like she was an interloper or intruder in my Gma's life.  She was first told that her birth was a result of a rape,  but my Great Aunt said that it wasn't true, that Grandma said that to make her look like she was the victim. 

My Mother, right up until she died two years ago, always wanted to know if her Father really knew about her,  and she had suspected that a girl she worked with was her half sister,  but couldn't prove it.  She went to her grave a sad, neurotic mess because she never learned the truth about who she really is and her ""other"" family.  I just want to know my Aunts.  Would they like me?  Do they know about us?  If they do,  why haven't they reached out?  

So yeah... Sorry this was long but at 51 I just want to say secrets SUCK and they do you NO favors."

Of my sibs the only one that never had kids was my eldest sister, and not because she never tried; it just didn't happen. 

My Mamere (Dad's Mom) always wanted a large family,  and stopped talking to her own Mom because she wanted more than three (she was pregnant with #4 at the time). She had ten boys, two girls (Dad is #15) and taught all of them how to care for themselves, including sewing, knitting, cooking, caring for a home, and all kinds of life skills. (Mom was taught the same,  just add crocheting to that.) All of Mamere's kids helped out and there was never a ""that's a boy thing,  there's a girl thing"" (like,  for example, changing diapers or vacuuming); yet in my Mom's family, it was very much the ""housework = women's work"" and ""men are breadwinners"" mindset.
