If someone wants to say you can’t then work till you can prove them wrong. Never say it verbally, smack them in the face with your hard work and dedication. An example would be, rn I’m working my ass off to try and get back some I love. Will it work? God knows. But I’m doing it regardless of what all of my “friends” said. Why? Because in the end I will find some form of success that they won’t. And I know it’s hard, trust me. By the end of the day I’m slitting my wrists and begging for death. And in the morning I’m praying for them back and go to work. Show your weakness only to yourself till you find someone to share it with, you can talk to me if you want.
