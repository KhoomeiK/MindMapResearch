Mommit,fq7uylj,t3_gh75h8,1589152742.0,"Hi! I'm a single mom to a 3 &1/2 yo boy. He recently stated telling me to go away, like all the time. Or if I tell him I love him sometimes he'll downright tell me he doesn't love me. (Only if hes mad at me but still.) He adores my significant other though, and I've never heard my son tell them to go away.
It hurts, it's hard. But, you're their safe place. The people you feel the safest around are usually the people you take your bad feelings out on, same goes for tiny humans! I dont know why kids seem to go through a few phases where mom is...ignored? But i do know that child adores you, it's normal and it will get better."

Mommit,fn9uowd,t3_g09hyp,1586784991.0,"My LO is 3 & 1/2 and every day he wakes up asking to go to the zoo. Every time we take our dog on a walk he wants to go to the park. He was just about to start preschool and speech therapy, 3 days before everything closed down he was going to finally be evaluated for autism after waiting for months. But you know what, we can make a zoo with stuffed animals. We can make obstacle courses and things to climb. And being here constantly with me since I cant go to work, he says at least one new word every day. Our little ones need us, and honestly not much else. Be there for her, make that delicious cake, take pictures! Her memories will be of how much her momma did for her. You are amazing, all you mommas out there are amazing. Every kids cake has a few momma tears."
aww,flhlwwt,t3_forph8,1585165157.0,I showed this to all my roommates and every one of us had the same reaction. Holy fuck. This is amazing.
depression,fknhqdb,t3_fji4v4,1584366039.0,"I agree with the statement above! Men are handsome. Girls are beautiful. I identify as pansexual because I got tired of everyone judging based on a skin suit. Your heart and kindness are what people will want to stick around for. You're so much more than just a face. And yeah girls can focus too much on looks, but that's because we're told we have to. All we reall want is a man (or woman) to hold us when we're sad and maybe give us chicken nuggets sometimes. Hang in there man."
depression,fjkqr25,t3_fduopy,1583432044.0,"Looks dont matter to everyone. You become lovely based on what your soul looks like. It makes my heart sad to see boys who think the way they look makes them any less. You have so much pressure coming at you from every corner, and you're right that's not fair. But I've never kept someone around simply because they were nice to look at. You're so much more than the mask you have to wear around."
Mommit,fjkpdd4,t3_fdviyq,1583431263.0,"Today I cried because my toddler ate my breakfast. He had already eaten breakfast, and I made myself a little egg and cheese pita pocket sandwich. I went to the bathroom and by the time I came back out, he had demolished it. I do not know how his tiny mouth managed to eat all of it so quickly. It was the last of the eggs and cheese. All I wanted today was eggs and cheese. Momming is a consistantly ridiculous experience, you're not the first and won't be the last mom to cry over burnt food. Hang in there!"

depression,fi0nt9y,t3_f5s880,1582041110.0,"Never compare yourself to your siblings, or anyone. That said, i'm in the same boat, my siblings outshine me in every way. Even when they make the same mistakes I do, they fix it better than I can. That doesn't make me, or you, any less deserving of love and care. I know it's not much, having strangers online try and tell you that you're worth it. But at least one person saw your story and cared so much they couldn't scroll past, and thats something.
Also I was raped when I was 10, didnt tell anyone until I was 15. When I told her, my mom said she wanted to check and see if my hymen was torn because she ""didnt remember seeing any blood on my clothes"" from 5 years before. 
Your story happened, and it's awful, and not everyone will treat it with respect. Not even the people who should care the most.  But I'm older now and it's a part of me, whether people care or not. I try to grow from my past, it was horrible. Horrible things still happen and I wonder what I did wrong to keep getting a shit hand in life. But all I can do it take it and try to turn it into something I can grow from. I can talk to the people in my community who are in the same place I was in and I can give them hope, and thats something too."
depression,fi0m658,t3_f5ovwo,1582040106.0,"Hi good stranger! I've suffered from depression almost as long as I can remember. Suicide has always been a peaceful thought for me. But I have a son now, he'll be four soon. He's getting screened for autism next month, hes non-verbal, little things really get to him, hes ""behind' all the other kids I see, and as a first time single mom I struggled for awhile thinking I just wasn't good at teaching him. But I'll tell you one thing, i am more proud of him now than if he were ""normal"". I love that he figured out how to communicate without words, all on his own. I adore seeing him get braver at little things most kids dont have a problem with. I absolutely do not care if hes autistic, he is smart and capable in ways he figured out for himself.  I'm so sorry the world is harder to get through. It doesn't make you lesser, from what I've seen in my son it makes you different in a way that you might have to figure out how to do things in your own way. The world may not be built for you but you were made to be here, you can work around it. I have faith in you, no ones life would be better if you were gone."
depression,fhfutnk,t3_f2qwaw,1581551816.0,"I've been experiencing the same sort of thing. It feels like a slow regression, it's like I'm forgetting the things I used to know, but at the same time I have a really hard time retaining new information. It's been making me feel incredibly stupid and self conscious. Even simple things like spelling are getting harder. I dont have a solution for it yet, but you are definitely not alone. And dont worry about getting a reputation, you're going through something that's valid. Give yourself some slack, love."
Mommit,ffzse29,t3_evx99k,1580391533.0,"Make you feel my love by adele, I've sang it every night to my son since he was born. 3 years later, hes speech delayed but boy will he hum with me."
autism,ffwtxe6,t3_eoywjt,1580310916.0,"My family does neurofeedback at integrative mind connections because my brother has aspergers where as I have had a long history of depression, anxiety, and addictive behaviors. My brother has always been socially inept, he's 25, never had a job or even gotten his own gas. Now hes in school and has a girlfriend and he seems more confident, more hopeful. After I started neurofeedback it made my mind clearer. I have a lot of childhood trauma which is what jump started my addictions. I find that with consistent neuro feedback training my brain is a lot calmer. I used to want to give up every day, everything was too much for me to handle. I truly believed there was no hope left for me. But since this helps me clear my head, I can think more rationally. I do have things to live for and things I can contribute to the world. It can be pricey and time consuming. I suggest trying it with your daughter for maybe 10 sessions, if it seems to help fantastic. If it doesn't, don't be discouraged. You're doing everything you can for your daughter and there's so many resources that help different people in different ways. I don't know much more about it, I only know how I feel after doing it consistantly. It's also helping my son who is speech delayed, hes 3 and doesn't talk but after starting neurofeedback hes up to 40+ words! Good luck with your little one, I know it's hard to be worried about them and just want the best solution."
