SkyChildrenOfLight,fqiecnf,t3_giy4ay,1589394863.0,"Every week I go on an Eden run on my spare account.. I do it for fun and help others out. I hate when I help somebody for like 10 minutes of my life and they bail out at the point of no return though, it's like they get scared or something even though I've played through Eden like 10 times. :("

I feel like every thought I had and dismissed in the day time all of a sudden comes at me in the evenings, filling me with the fear I'm going to die. Along with that I also think I'm the friend nobody cares about and hates. It isn't crippling fear though. More of a wave of sadness and thousands of scenarios going through my head. Sometimes im at school and run to class and out of the bathroom in fear that somebody in there might attempt to murder me or interact with me. Do I have anxiety or am I just irrational and have problems with trust?"
