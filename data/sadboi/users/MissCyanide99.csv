Some require you to have a referral from your PCP to see a specialist and some don't in order for them to cover it. Mine doesn't require one and it's covered. Some don't require  one but they will only cover a certain percentage of the visit without a referral. That's why I said make sure you call to ask your insurance first.

As someone else said, ""May you go Home in peace"" sounds perfect. You can say it to yourself like a prayer or you could say it out loud (if appropriate). Maybe touch your patient's hand as you say it or do it afterward.

Once your shift is over, you could say some longer prayers or blessings for those who passed once you're home. Light a candle for them, say your blessings, and keep their family in your thoughts. This will allow you to decompress and fully process your feelings in a safe place. 

I'm in vet med so death is treated a lot differently than human med, but I always said I little prayer for the pets to myself once they passed. Giving lots of scratches and loves always helped as they passed. Then I'd either secretly cry in the bathroom whenever I got a chance or repress all those feelings until I got home. 

I'm not sure what you believe in, however I'm Catholic. I attached an example of some of my prayers if you're interested in checking them out. Maybe you can use them or gain some inspiration from them. I hope this all made sense. I'm really tired, haha.

The ER isn't the right place for these kinds of infections unless you're legit dying. 

You're going to need on-going care for your condition, no matter what it is. It's really hard to tell anything from your pictures, IMO, so for the best outcome, find a doctor in your area to give you a proper exam, take some samples, run some tests, and get you on the road to recovery.

We redditors can try to help you to the best of our ability, but we can only speculate since we're not there to physically see you, and you deserve better than that. Keep pushing until you find a doc that will help you. üíñ
