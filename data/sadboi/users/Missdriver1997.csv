I know its not good when people say 'focus on the positives' but you really have to if you are depressed.

Im 23 F. never had a relationship. I have no friends. No one checks up on me either. Its incredibly hard and Im pretty normal too, Im not even that introverted. , I like going out and being a normal young adult- but no one cares so it def hurts when no one checks up on me so i can relate to feeling people dont give a fuck about you.

depression,foqlknx,t3_g8uhaa,1587996206.0,"Yes. Ive been super nostalgic for most of my life about my childhood. (Ive battled depression for 10 years). I think nostalgia is not a good thing to focus on, because depression wants to make you feel like life was truly perfect before, during that time period. It may have been better, but it wasnt perfect.

Also, a lot of people only feel nostalgic about their childhoods (I know i do), you cant really compare childhood with any other time in your life and think 'oh i wish it was still  like that', because when you are child you are pretty much completely innocent and have no responsibilities. You are also not focusing on any negative aspects of your life during that current point in time. Therefore no negative memories to focus on or reflect upon, which catches people up in an unrealistic nostalgia."

depression,foqkaz4,t3_g8uems,1587995455.0,"Maybe this is an ignorant view...I dont want to discount a lot of people and their feeelings but tbh I think you will find a lot of people dont really know what true depression is actually  like. This is especially true for people who are teenagers and young people.

I would say most people here, using this subreddit are actually depressed, just given the nature of reddit itself. But I find a lot of people who are quite noisy about it on facebook and instagram havent actually experienced it.

I see a lot of people my age posting on facebook or instagram saying 'oh im depressed, I feel so bad I wasted my time on him etc or I didnt get that dream job :("" etc, but then the are quite happy going out every weekend, posting pictures of themselves on instagram, travelling, talking about their job, achievements they made recently in a positive light, looking for men/women etc on tinder etc.

Those dont really point to the actions of someone who is truly depressed imho. Its attention seeking.

Depression is not being able to get up and go to work or apply for work because you think you are too worthless in the first place. Depression is not even using facebook and instagram to look at videos because you just cant stand those platforms because you feel so fucking inferior. Depression is thinking you cant do anything right ever. Depression is thinking you are ugly, dumb and stupid. Depression is not wanting to go anywhere except to bed. Depression is being too scared to use tinder because you think your worthless and no one will ever love you. Depression is not feeling sad because your date is ghosting you, its not having a relationship for years because you are too emotionally closed off to even date.

So your answer is no. Not everyone is depressed. People confuse feeling sad with depression alot in my opinion."
