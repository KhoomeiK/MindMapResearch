For one, unconstitutional. 

Two, if they haven’t committed a crime, there’s no solid evidence for their thought crime, so people would be falsely accused. 

Three, if pedophiles are scared to get help because they know they’re gonna get executed, then they won’t get help, and that makes them more likely to act on it so CSA rates would go up. 

Four, this requires raising a lot of taxes that could be going to public resources or military."

So I can’t really speak for therapist because I’ve never been to one. 

But anyway, as I was saying, a psychiatrist is great because they can diagnose and refer therapists, and they’re just a great starting point. Make sure though, to make it very clear that you don’t plan on committing a crime. Like You have reasons to not commit a crime, you have life goals, or a good moral compass. Whatever it is stopping you from acting on it, let the doctor know. 

Good luck, I hope things go well for you."
