Porém esse caixão é quadrado, não o caixão comum. Poucos cemitérios no Brasil têm capacidade de receber um desses, fora que não são tão comuns assim de serem encontrados/pedidos (até por quê poucas pessoas pedem por um em específico, além de também provavelmente terem um preço diferenciado, o valor do serviço funerário gira em torno de uns 2-4 mil levando em consideração o do meu pai em 2012, que era muito alto e precisou de caixão especial e saiu por volta de 3,5k na época).

Então eu escolho o caixão por quê é só chegar com meus travesseiros e cobertor que ninguém vai me perturbar pedindo pra sentar pra poder sentar também."

Yes, the same people who tell that you're underqualified and/or lack of experience are also telling other people that they have too much or they aren't good enough employees because they have (or are around the age people start having) children."

I have a college degree, speak 3 languages besides my mother tongue, have many courses of leadership and negotiating, I've lived abroad and I don't get many responses because I lack 3+ years of field experience for something I could easily do (and obviously they underpay people who have everything I have + the experience, even with the benefits it's still way lower than it should be)."

But rules are rules for a reason, I drive sometimes through the night (it's not forbidden where I live yet and I'm going nuts staying inside at all times, I'm diagnosed with anxiety) and the governor forbid any kind of agglomerations (meaning no church meetings, no malls could be open, only a few types of doctors' offices can be open, banks have forbid more than 5 people at once inside any agency and it's taxes season, supermarkets installed windows for the cashiers, bars can't be open at all and restaurants can only operate with delivery, drive thru or pick up for eating at home, only a few bakeries are allowing people to eat inside but they have separations).

On the 6th day of quarantine the local mall was open and FILLED with parents and elders, the bakery that practically only elders shop had to desperately convince elders to order through the app and only go there to pick up (as you can imagine it's not really working), there's even people driving around trying to convince others to go back inside.

Same with surgical gloves and hand sanitizers, and when you find it it's absurdly overpriced (a hand sanitizer that would cost a dollar, maybe two TOPS, is now costing TWENTY dollars)"
