LSAT,fqqsf5r,t3_gkb9ra,1589571121.0,"It catches flack as the weakest of the trilogy, but I was pretty putrid at RC too until I got the RC Bible by powerscore. The VIEWSTAMP technique really showed me what to look for while I’m reading. Ellen Cassidy’s loophole, specifically her basic translation drill for LR helps your reading in general. I’d say both are worthwhile investments if you’re trying to boost your reading in general for the LSAT. Don’t give up. This mess is hard and dense for everyone, it’s all about equipping yourself with the tools to better understand the stuff. If my 145 cold diagnostic butt can do it, you can too!"

depression,fgpsart,t3_eztxz3,1581011030.0,Same. I used to have these dreams where I could imagine whole musical compositions. It was the one thing that gave me any validation that I was worth anything as a musician. Alas depression killed it and now I can’t do shit. I have nothing to offer

depression,fcomy6y,t3_ei5ufi,1577836269.0,Yeah I’m there right now. I can’t follow conversations nor can I really figure anything out or think for myself atm. I’m pretty much convinced that I’ve always been really stupid and have just gone through life thus far with the blinders on and people lying to me. I often walk around aimlessly and feel like an 80 year old man with dementia... Depressions a bitch
depression,fc0fory,t1_fbzsjd8,1577289689.0,"Because I’m completely alienated. I’m the odd one out in a group of extremely intelligent, interesting, and extroverted people. I’m the antithesis of all of that. 

I’m not sure if my lack of personal autonomy at the moment is due to mental illness, having little to no cognitive ability, or just a lack of character/laziness. 

Hmm I can’t remember. My memory is pretty much gone tbh. I had a bout of drug-induced psychosis this past April which essentially wiped out what remained of my rational mind. This combined with the severe, clinical depression has really fucked me man... I do remember having some pretty heavy conversations with my mom and other people, but that’s just it. There’s almost never any levity in any conversation I have. I feel the need to unload all of my anxieties and worries on others which is fucking toxic. I’m like a child searching for security. I honestly don’t wanna put other people through the hell of dealing with me so I prefer to stay away."
depression,fc0cxud,t1_fbztk6r,1577287275.0,"It’s having absolutely nothing come to mind. My thoughts are so scrambled, incoherent, and slow. I can’t really plot out or plan a conversation. The only internal dialogue I can manage revolves around how pathetic, hopeless, and unintelligent i am."

I guess the best advice I can offer is to just try everything and stay active. I’ve shot myself in the foot over the years by not sufficiently addressing my depression and, now that I’ve had more free time than any other time in my life, am dealing with anhedonia. Shits tough, but we’ll find our way!"
OCD,f7qtszm,t1_f7kj7pd,1573969501.0,"Yeah I would say so. Cyclical thinking under psychedelics is pretty common, but I think the additive effect of the drugs plus the pure o has a good chance of overcharging your obsession. At least that’s what happened to me. Again, we’re all different so just know thyself homie."
OCD,f7ji3t5,t3_dwftg3,1573778094.0,"I wouldn’t recommend it. Though every mind is different, I have pure o and my experience with shrooms still screw with me to this day. Only thing it did for me was make me infinitely more neurotic and given to cyclical thinking which, as you know, ain’t good for someone with pure o. Weigh your decision wisely and do the necessary research."

I just got a degree in psychology and worked in the field for a hot minute only to find out that I haven’t the aptitude nor passion for the tumultuous, unpredictable nature of the behavioral health field.

At least you have some practical interests (disillusioned musician here), I’m kinda stuck lamenting the past and wishing I chose a more challenging degree like philosophy. 

For you, I would say leverage your critical thinking and reading skills which you undoubtedly picked up in university.

I’m just speculating, but I think we both may’ve made reading a huge huge deal in our heads, attached a ton of significance to its nuclei developing a bit of a complex, leading to that negative voice taking hold whenever we try to read/understand anything.

One of the things that helped me in college was to simply use bullet points and visualize myself speaking and covering the points. I still struggle with everyday small talk and dialogue though. Like everyone else here, I can kind of vacillate between taking forever to search through the wide array of weird connections rooting from our intuition/subconscious when I’m thinking at a high level and getting tongue tied; or just not knowing wtf to say and feeling like a damn fool lmao."

A friend of mine is going to Architecture school and informed me of a masters program at a good local school that I could probably get into. I don’t really know much about architecture, but the creative aspect of it appeals to me. Really, I’m considering going to school for an M.Arch or heading to law school. Could you possibly give me a little insight into the trade: the skills necessary, possibilities for improvement, realities, and your personal fulfillment? Thanks again"

infj,ey27gl0,t1_ey1qp08,1566728636.0,"Well I’m glad someone with pretty much my exact circumstances is out there! You’re right about the world being shit around us and full of other people, but like the therapist cat on here said, its up to us to change our inner world. Im also an extremely anxious person who’s mind can go at 1000% looking for all of the things that could and probably will go wrong, so know you ain’t alone. I also wish I could just go live in a forest like in Oblivion or something lol. Lastly, you’ve gotta be quite tough to have stuck it out and finished school with how difficult things have been for you this far. Big ups for that homie. I think we’ll both find happiness; just gotta keep fighting through it."
infj,ey1gw5v,t3_cua0aw,1566699337.0,Just wanted to offer sincere thanks for everyone that took the time to offer such great advice. I already feel significantly better and there does seem to be something to strive towards. I’ve just gotta put in the work and push towards finding what that thing is. I also feel that I understand (or am close to understanding) the big thing about myself that I’m afraid of losing: my empathy. Can’t let that shit dissipate. Much love to all of you.

infj,exw9wo7,t1_exw0lff,1566616145.0,"Damn. Your journey makes me feel quite a bit better. I chose psych for the same reasons, but I actually never had the opportunity to take a clinical class. I also never factored in how little therapists and psychologists make; the return for all the school is pretty subpar. I’ve also been looking at other fields to go to grad school like maybe architecture or even law school. Thanks again for your response and I’m happy that you’re happy!"
infj,exvzmrj,t1_exud2ma,1566609689.0,"I also got diagnosed with OCD when I turned 17! It’s a really hellish disorder which, looking back, has really isolated me from a lot. You’re right about finding a good therapist. I haven’t seen anybody regularly since then, but it certainly helped."
infj,exvzb32,t1_extb9k2,1566609522.0,Thank you. Your message of solidarity was beautiful by the way. Even more impressive that you write with such eloquence with English as your second language. I took German up to a moderate level in college and can’t touch that lol

infj,exsvenq,t1_exstp02,1566557716.0,"Academically I loved it for the most part. Of course there were stressors and it could be a lot, but I loved learning new things and expanding my mind. I loved the freedom of focusing my research interests on stuff that actually interested me. I did fuck up my first semester due to sheer immaturity, but I did rebound and was overall a curious, inquisitive student. i do wish that I would’ve declared a philosophy double major though and studied abroad. As I presupposed in my post, my depression at times led me to have a pessimistic outlook on my academics and others, but primarily others. I actually transferred colleges because I felt that I didn’t socially belong in my first school only to find out that I should’ve never left, but nonetheless ground it out at my new school. Talking to people in class and shit was hard; I’ve never been great at presenting myself to others in an interesting enough manner. I didn’t like parties very much at all, but I could be ok if I was drunk or high. Overall, I got through college with the motivation that the next step would be better; that I’d be around more mature people and could pursue music."

infj,exssp5m,t1_exss1si,1566555490.0,I’m glad you broke out of your depression. You’re absolutely right about the judgmental aspect of it. I certainly recognize that I carried myself with a false sense of superiority and arrogance making snap judgments like crazy. I also just signed up last week with a volunteer organization in town to try and do just that. Thanks again for your response
infj,exss6i5,t1_exsoi5e,1566555041.0,"Sure. I’m in Phoenix, AZ and am a guitarist that plays a pretty wide range of genres. I grew up loving funk, soul and jazz (old school black family) which will always be in my playing. I trained under a great rock/avant-garde guitarist during my teen years which got me into playing fucked up rock, classical, and studying free improv (late era Coltrane’s my shit) till I graduated. I’ve never formally released anything, but I’ve gigged a lil bit and jammed around the PHX scene quite a bit. I guess I’d describe my playing (when I’m actually practicing like I should) as a pretty modern mix of styles with tribal like rhythms and wide, ambiguous voicings."

You’re right about leisure, but another thing I worry about is taking it too easy if you know what I mean.

infj,exsp7ih,t1_exskzac,1566552313.0,"Wow. Thank you so much for your informative, wonderful response. You’re absolutely right about the negative feedback loop that comes from depression. I know that I’ve consciously been trying to sleep as much as possible to avoid the hurt. Oversleeping has always been a tool that I and other family members have used to shut out mental duress. Regarding your second part, I know that I am extremely analytical. I know that the source of much of my depression is rooted in past regret. Stuff like: i wish I would’ve worked harder and done more in school, and much more pertinent, personal stuff. I will absolutely heed your advice and further probe into these thoughts with the goal of switching them around. You have my sincere thanks for your much needed response.

However, my therapist turned me on to this book called “Brain Lock” by Jeffrey M. Schwartz. It really put the disorder into perspective for me. For once, I didn’t feel powerless and I had some tools to break the cycle. Just know that to live, you don’t have to suffer. Life does not have to be spiral and anticipation repeated over and over again. You can beat this evil disorder. We’re all in it together!"

We’re all in this together man!"
confidence,et15afj,t3_c9ogaz,1562391948.0,"You’re certainly worth a lot. It may not feel like it, but the fact that you’re carrying on and pursuing a degree in spite of what you’ve gone through is a testament to your strength. I, and I’d bet everyone on here is familiar with that feeling of being totally alone. It’s simply a part of our shared human experience along with the fact that you’re smart: thinking beyond surface level can be kinda depressing and lead to over-analysis which can impair self-confidence! Many of us have also faced the soul crushing lows that come with an ill upbringing. So you’re not nearly as alone as you feel. However, knowing something rationally often doesn’t negate the emotional aspect unfortunately. To raise my own confidence, I found that exercise, reading, and playing an instrument really helped boost my own self worth. A book that really helped me is The Community of the Self by Na’im Akbar. Really great advice for moving on and not becoming a slave to memory. I sincerely wish you well, but I have a feeling you’ll knock this shit out 🙌🏽"

I’m mixed too with mom being half black half Spanish and pops being half black half white. My dad was adopted by my two fully black grandparents, and I was subsequently raised with the sole identity of being a black man from all sides. But yeah, I really only noticed the racial labeling that people put on you in high school and college. The whole “you’re not the stereotype we’re accustomed to” shit pretty much only came from white kids. Annoying, but whatever. I think my situation is kinda unique though. I certainly know other mixed people with the straight fully black mom fully white dad dynamic that would probably totally agree with you. Again, it’s all about culture and the sources of the information that malleable you received."
Christianity,eoy17ay,t3_btgs10,1558931932.0,"This happened to me too. I turned to religion during my high school years and concurrently got hit by a barrage of severe anxiety disorders plus depression. I called to God for relief and guidance, but nothing happened. At the same time, I was put off by the severe fire and brimstone/ everybody but us is damned mentality that my High school was constantly preaching. My point is that sometimes these trials occur and solely having faith that you will one day have faith must suffice. God appreciates that level of yearning and perseverance. Experience is also key, and in my opinion, drew me closer to the lord over time. There were simply too many bizarre, almost metaphysical experiences that I had which proved to me that God existed. So in all I would advise you take your time, this dilemma that you’re facing is likely something that will draw you closer to the lord. Remember that you’ll always be loved by the lord and all his true followers. God bless you :)"
