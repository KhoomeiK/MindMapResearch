Nope, just because you invented a rule about what potentially wrong pronoun to use first, does not obligate the rest of the world to follow your inventions - we are not obligated to use a potentially wrong plural pronoun off the bat because you say so. Also,  Sultry penguin never said what pronouns sultry penguin uses, so nothing to correct there.

>Pronouns aren't 'earned' and can't be taken away as a punishment, it's just being decent.

Didn't say that. Your gaslighting this implication where none was made is a form of emotional abuse.

>Telling someone your pronouns when they get them wrong is just as ""narcissistic"" as correcting them when they call you the wrong name (it's not).


Quote where that user told me the pronouns that that user uses. You can't, because that user didn't say the pronouns that that user uses. Sultry penguin said only:

>Stop using She. Those aren't my pronouns.


Since sultry penguin never stated the preferred pronouns, there is nothing to correct. 

And on that note, since you apparently like analogies- would you be irate that I didn't know your real life name from your comments on reddit? Because expecting someone to know your pronouns (as again, sultry penguin never stated the pronouns sultry penguin uses), is akin to expecting someone to know your real life name from your reddit comments. That's a more accurate analogy than the one you used, you're welcome. 


That's some incredible level of narcissism to expect people to know someone's pronouns on reddit - and then gaslight others in response to their normal use of English.

Especially since u/Sultry_Penguin never said what pronouns sultry penguin uses,  therefore there was nothing to correct. You contorted things in your response to me - that's gaslighting.

Feeling empty or numb is called me polyvagal shutdown in cptsd

Lacking a sense of self or stable identity is called both dissociation (depersonalization) and disruptions to ego development in cptsd.

Fear of abandonment is called fear of abandonment in cptsd.

Splitting is called being triggered or emotional flashbacks in cptsd.

CPTSD,fmrfflf,t3_fwt1qd,1586321633.0,"It’s not unintentional. There is a difference between a person being *aware* of their own intentions, versus doing something accidentally or unintentionally.

They abuse on purpose. It is deliberate. It has intention.

That they lack self awareness of their intentions is another matter entirely."
CPTSD,fmrf6ob,t1_fmrf4w4,1586321437.0,Your abuse tactic is fucked up - consider that.
CPTSD,fmrevi9,t1_fmreokb,1586321190.0,"Rather than attempting to gaslight me into believing I’ve done something wrongly when I haven’t, like you just did - read the post again. It’s good advice. You want to recover? Start taking it.

Or you know. Just keep lashing out instead and trying to rob others of advice that could help them because you cannot or will not take ownership of your own reactions and instead need to blame and shame others (a common abuse tactic that people complain about on this sub, and yet here you are engaging in that abuse tactic yourself right now.)

Hint: it’s not automatically “rude” just because you got triggered by it."
BPD,fmreo8u,t3_fwvean,1586321027.0,"Yes this is due to lack of integration and dissociation. You’re either in this state or that state, and your whole memory and perspective changes because of the current state you are in."
BPD,fmrd94z,t3_fwsmbh,1586319908.0,"Yea I think that’s a big negative about diagnosing people with a personality disorder, instead of a trauma disorder. The former is billed as a life long consistent and constant illness that can only, at best, be “managed”, whereas the latter is a syndrome that can be recovered from. This difference in prognosis makes the former a more hopeless seeming diagnosis than the latter, even with all the overlap between the two."
NPD,fmrd0rp,t1_fmp8ed1,1586319730.0,"Oh I don’t trust my emotions either - I think many former victims do not, as they were taught to distrust their emotions. In fact that distrust of emotions is part of the symptoms of trauma meant to be treated and overcome, so that one can begin to trust their emotions after having spent all childhood being taught to distrust them.

But I wasn’t talking about emotions. I was talking about feelings - bodily sensations. There’s nothing to trust or distrust about bodily sensations, those just are.

What you described above sounds like emotions - you liking that guy. But what were your bodily sensations during that encounter? What were your physical somatic feelings? I’m curious. What is there to “distrust” about those physical feelings in your body?"
NPD,fmrcr8j,t1_fmqwu40,1586319531.0,"Well I’ve never managed to maintain self awareness through mental efforts.

In order to maintain self awareness I need to ground myself in my body and feel my somatic feelings in my body. This drastically changes my perspectives and thought processes, more than I ever thought possible.

I’m not sure what you wanted me to elaborate on? Basically getting connected with my body’s feelings is how I’ve avoided being stuck in my head, (dissociating,)and has made me much more self aware of my behaviors, while drastically changing my thoughts without actually having to work with my thoughts at all.

Working with my thoughts to combat thoughts always turned out to be totally wasted time and effort. Turns out just by being grounded in my somatic feelings, I can change my thoughts just by being in touch with my bodily sensations."
BPD,fmp7lvz,t1_fmp77z7,1586275928.0,Thank you for the link.
CPTSD,fmp6wwv,t3_fwc7tg,1586275561.0,"Absolutely. But yes people do mean it to be saying something about that character. Given how many mental health issues survivors of abuse or neglect frequently have, it’s not totally off base or irrelevant to say that statement either. 

Some people from horrendously abusive or neglectful backgrounds are fabulous. But many many more struggle daily with various severe symptoms as a result of not “coming from a good family.”"
NPD,fmp6nvx,t1_fmoudz8,1586275427.0,"Does that work for you? Because it’s never worked for me.

The only way I’ve found to maintain any self awareness with any consistency at all, is to become aware of my somatic feelings in my body.

Grounding myself in my somatic feelings in my body (as opposed to getting lost in my head with thoughts or fantasies) has been the only thing that has ever worked for me to any degree."
BPD,fmp5rle,t1_fmp1h10,1586274952.0,Where did you read all of this? Sounds interesting I want to look more into it.
CPTSD,fmp5eev,t1_fmo1pmd,1586274756.0,"Yes weed is also an addictive substance, also used to avoid the pain of trauma processing. But it’s nowhere near as dangerous like alcohol, benzos, and opiates."
CPTSD,fmp5516,t1_fmo029e,1586274618.0,To get rid of toxic shame a person has to compete their trauma processing. Complete the trauma processing and the toxic shame will dissipate.
CPTSD,fmmtsx8,t1_fmmo5bk,1586211945.0,It is super duper hard. Good for you overcoming it.
BPD,fmmkdij,t1_fmmdgee,1586206862.0,Yea. Toxic shame is a huge part of many personality disorders and CPTSD. It’s so hard to deal with.
BPD,fmmka03,t1_fmmf2bv,1586206812.0,"No one should be lay person diagnosed by others just because a person doesn’t like their behavior. Using professional diagnoses designed for treatment just as an insult to anybody is really inappropriate, whether they’ve NPD traits or not or other cluster b issues. We are in agreement on that of course. I just meant that many have to hear this new fad way of insulting people, not it’s those with bpd."
