BlackPeopleTwitter,fbcjgxy,t1_fb98o35,1576725377.0,"It’s just a weird emotion of emptiness and having constant anticipation of him coming back home even though he isn’t. It’s like my my mind doesn’t want me to believe it, but then I get flashbacks of me next to him at the hospital. It makes it a little better know long that he knew I loved him so fucking much and would do anything for him. 

All I can say is, if you haven’t spoken to your parents do so and tell them how much you love them. Also, get informed about what they want done once they passed. 

My dad didn’t have life insurance and never talked about ultimately what he wanted."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fbcizkm,t1_fb9v5l8,1576725038.0,"Thanks for your kind words my friend! I feel like living in America, you have to rush to take care of everything. You’re lucky if your job provides you bereavement. Literally hours after he passed we had to figure out what funeral home to choose and what we could afford to do with him. I swear that was the worst few days of my life. 

I don’t really know how to grieve though... like all I want is for him to come back. I know deep down though he wants me to fight and keep going! I refuse to let him down!"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fb8xpt5,t3_ec14z2,1576624322.0,"Healing is difficult and weird when you lose someone close. I literally watched my dad die unexpectedly 3 weeks ago. It’s just sooooo foreign to me. I still feel like he’s gonna pop up and say “Hey baby girl!!” What’s really eating me up inside is that I never got  to say goodbye.

Time truly does heal everything, and having amazing friends and family helps tremendously!!!🙏🏾."

selfimprovement,ew4qu3k,t3_cmtei2,1565116373.0,"Your mind makes you think you aren’t good enough/worthy of anything positive. You believe you don’t look good, so you always pass when it’s time go out with your girlfriends.

You aren’t satisfied with what you have. You always compare yourself to others and their accomplishments, but never look at yours. For me it just creates this cycle that affects any and all relationships in your life."
