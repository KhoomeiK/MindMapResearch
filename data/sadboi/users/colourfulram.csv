AskReddit,flz9exl,t3_fs3thk,1585618460.0,"I know there’s a lot going on with covid-19 but I’m really worried about this now.

A few weeks ago I was taken to hospital with severe abdominal pain with D & V was treated for the pain with codeine which obviously then caused constipation and the pain subsided a bit so I was sent home after 7 days and a clear uss and ct scan.

Anyway fast forward two weeks and I found out that I am gdh positive but don’t have any toxins but because I’m symptomatic they’ve prescribed a 2 week course of Metronidazole400mg. I’ve been taking them a week and still have D and V. I was meant to have an endoscopy last week but was cancelled due to covid19.

I’ve lost almost 1 and a half stone and I’m really worried. I got a call from my gp today to say that my h-pylori test has come back positive too but they can’t treat this because of the gdh. 

I’m really just looking for advise and to put my mind at rest because the pain I’m having is horrific and I have bipolar with psychosis so trying not to convince myself that I’m actually dying."
