chronotrigger,fny3gxa,t1_fnxrpyg,1587352488.0,"One more bit of advice. 

You can sorta, kind of, give it a difficulty setting by your combat choices. On your first playthrough, I recommend you attack most enemies you come across. That will ensure your level will be what the game expects it to be when you hit each part of the game. 

For an easier experience, farm enemies by killing them and leave the area, then come back and repeat until you level up. 

For a hard experience, skip a lot of the skip-able encounters and you'll have a good ol' struggle through the game. Again, I recommend the first, and most obvious option."
