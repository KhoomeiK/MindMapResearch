If you just want to resupply and don’t care for the extra xp by doing it multiple times.. simply finish the resupply mission, if it still says production halted then switch lobbies and it will have production back up and running again."

As far as the predictions saying “less than 100k”... lol. I can go ahead and tell you it is almost definite that we will pass 100k deaths in the next month or less. Those predictions are near useless because they are constantly proven wrong and they are constantly being changed. The situation has only gotten worse in the US because lockdown isn’t enforced. And the government fails to enforce it because they care too much about the economy, but this will end up costing even more economic growth."

Since we hit the lows in March nothing has gotten better yet the stock market is up over 30% since then. You’re asking why the sudden downturn when the reality is we never should’ve seen it go up that fast in the first place.

Next time I’m just going to go for certain high value sets. I started out on the very left side of the map, outside tumbleweed. I went through the entire lower part of the map in a sort of up and down zig zag pattern heading to the right side of the map. Once I got to thieves landing I did blackwater and then headed left across the Great Plains. Once on the very left of that area I did the same zig zag pattern but heading upwards this time, only covering about 1/4 or 1/5 of the upper part of the map. Then I did this over and over (up or down whenever I hit an edge of the map) and then I hit up saint denis last because I hate the swamp area. I played from 9:30 pm to about 3:30/4 am so a good 6 hours of gameplay probably although I took some snack/phone breaks because it got tedious. As far as marking the map to remember what I collected... I used the jeanropke map and I got literally every single item minus a few doubles of flowers which I didn’t care for. On the jeanropke map you can tap the collectible and click to take it off the map after you’ve gotten it. What I do is I mark 5-10 points at once on my screen and then mark them as done on the jeanropke map BEFORE I collect them. Then as I collect I take the pins off the map. Once I reach the last pin, I open the jeanropke map and mark another 5-10 points in a way that will lead me across the map well. Rinse and repeat and dozens of repeats later... BOOM! 5k or so. Oh and I had an insane amount of doubles and I collected stuff off the NPCs I killed at outposts and such."
