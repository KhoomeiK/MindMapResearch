I already like isolating but after a month of doing nothing, I’ve started to suffer a bit. I’ve been doing so much of nothing all I do is daydream and overthink and it’s left me in this other world like I’ve lost my mind. 
I think it’s really important to stay busy doing these times and it’s so amazing you’re able to work on a farm. I haven’t done anything since school has ended and it’s hard to even mind motivation to go for a jog or do a painting."
