AskWomen,fq8s4d5,t1_fq7bld0,1589173973.0,"I'm sorry your having trouble - ironically I myself probably can't have kids too! 
Adoption is a wonderful choice, and even though inter-racial adoptions come with their own issues, you are most likely giving a child a way better shot in life and a better quality of living. 
For me, the fact I was separated from my language was the biggest problem - especially as I got older and wanted to connect with my people. I was never told anything about my country and wasn't shown photos or told anything. I found everything out for myself when the internet started becoming what it is. 
If you want to talk I am happy to answer any and all questions no matter how hard - you can send me a message :)"

I think I come back to them because they always act the perfect partner. Then once they already have you they show themselves. 
By then it's too late and you're already in too deep.
Like currently I've moved across the world for him and I can't go home. I can't leave."
