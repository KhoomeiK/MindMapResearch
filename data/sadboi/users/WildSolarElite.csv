NoStupidQuestions,fptxevu,t1_fpoxpja,1588900203.0,"Actually I think you being lucky is a lot more likely than the idea that every person who has ever studied blackjack odds has been wrong. The way you win by knowing the game is knowing basic strategy as well as card counting, deviations, and property betting strategy. Even with all of that there is a significant risk of ruin without a large bankroll. You have been lucky so far but you are playing a losing game."
NoStupidQuestions,fposiia,t1_fpnthly,1588789908.0,You got lucky. That’s all there is to it. Knowing perfect basic strategy is still a losing way to play blackjack mathematically. And it sounds like you might not even know basic strategy.

AskReddit,fnykwx2,t1_fnuwvti,1587366308.0,"There were some fun ones like freezing the sun and banning water.  The sun guy claimed that the sun caused cancer, was only around during the day when there was already light, stuff like that. He combined some frightening statistics with a number of blatant lies and made a surprisingly convincing argument about how the sun was a huge problem that needed to be fixed.

There were also some more serious papers that used the project as an opportunity to demonstrate the flaws in a certain idea by writing a paper supporting that idea. (This is the route I took). For example, if there was a conspiracy theory that they wanted to disprove, they wrote a paper that attempted to prove that conspiracy theory in a new way to demonstrate that the “proof” that the original conspiracy theorist used was meaningless. (It’s a bit convoluted so I’m not sure how successful an explanation that was.)

If you are looking for an interesting paper to write, I definitely recommend trying a format like this."

Swimming,ev8nvm1,t3_cgow8y,1564285396.0,"For your free, your entry is really short. You want to lengthen your stroke and focus on power with your catch and pull.

High tempo is very difficult for inexperienced swimmers because their strokes tend to shorten and they thrash around a lot, like you are. 

For breastroke, watch your head movement and try to limit unnecessary motions.  Also try to throw your arms forward quickly along the surface of the water during your recovery. Timing is difficult to master in breastroke, so make sure you are working with someone who knows what they are talking about."
Swimming,ev8mrnf,t3_cikgck,1564284370.0,"You want to bring your feet right over the top as you flip. Do not turn clockwise or counterclockwise until after you have left the wall. Push off on your back and turn over gradually as you do your underwater. You will get a better plant if you bring your legs straight over and plant with your feet separated (a bit less than shoulder width). You will also waste less time on the wall if you save the clockwise/counterclockwise turning mostly for when you are off the wall. While doing your underwaters, the direction you turn isn’t of utmost importance, but it may affect your breakout stroke.

These are the basic steps to a flip turn/ breakout. You can modify and improve on the timing of all the motions once you become more comfortable."

She might be just as Canadian as you, but that doesn’t make her white and it doesn’t mean she can no longer identify as Chinese.

You have pushed her to do a sport and now that she wants to you are trying to stop her. You are then trying to justify your decision with unrelated things. Injuries are prevalent in almost all sports (ex: soccer is the sport with the most concussions, but it sounds like you would have let her play soccer). The outfit isn’t a problem either (ex: swimmers and even runners wear stuff that is more revealing because it is part of the uniform).

The reason she wants to start the may not be the best, but it is a good opportunity for her to do something physical and for her to socialize. If it’s a bad experience she might quit, but she also might not forgive you if you don’t let her at least try it out."

Sounds like it’s about time you bought a second monopoly set and ruined the economy he is trying to create. This will allow you to access the stuff he is hoarding. It will also cause extreme hyperinflation and the items will cost less relative to the money supply in the future if he doesn’t notice the extra cash. If he does notice, it still makes his life more difficult because he will have to catalog the money (which also means he might not stop you in the future from using crumpled bills). 
Maybe you could even start your own currency. Charge tolls around the house, etc.

I didn’t feel cold which means my body wasn’t giving out any warning signs that I needed to warm up, but that wasn’t enough for her.

AskReddit,eu9lsck,t3_cf6cay,1563584054.0,"My grandfather was in the navy. He didn’t tell many stories about it because it was clear his experiences had scarred him, but he told a few and I didn’t want to ask him to relive any more than he wanted to.
The most memorable story was about one time when he was driving a landing craft up to an island in Japanese waters. The person in command of the landing craft (I’m not sure of their title because I’m not very familiar with the navy’s hierarchy system) told everyone to get down when they came under fire. He then looked at my grandfather and said something along the lines of “Everyone except for you. You’re expendable.” My grandfather obviously survived, but this shocked me at the time because I couldn’t imagine being told I was the one man that they could afford losing. That it wouldn’t really matter if I lived or died. I think it had to do something with the fact that driving the landing craft was favorable over some of the alternatives, but I feel it’s still a shocking thing to hear. 

He also told stories about the better parts of his experience. He told me they would hang their jeans overboard to soften them. He told me how excited he and the other men on his boat were to get a crate of apples. It was his first fresh fruit in a long time and he ate the apples whole, including the stem and core. He continued to eat them that way for the rest of his life. This stuff wasn’t really fun, but it was great compared to what was all around him.
He talked about the scary stuff; kamikazes that barely missed his boat, and how during a foggy night where communication was impossible his boat came within feet of crashing into another US boat in the formation.

I’m not sure how to sum this all up, except by saying that war is terrifying, there can be good parts, but nobody wants to be told they are expendable."
