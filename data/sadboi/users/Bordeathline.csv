It can have variations and differences between each case but the profile is very specific. A weak trait isn't a symptom. Borderline personality disorder is when those behaviors are FUCKING YOUR LIFE. When they solidify in a real mental illness."

BPD,fqhnji5,t1_fqgd6oa,1589380626.0,"Yes, we can hurt ourselves. And yes, we can hurt others too. As i've said before, we're much likely to do both. Even when it's not intended. We need to have the maturity to assume our toxic behaviors and work to get better. There's no excuses, and there's no blame too. Only responsabilities. Not being harmless isn't going to  make people run away instantaneously, and it shouldn't."
BPD,fqg2l68,t1_fqfhqt0,1589336641.0,"Not automatically, but it pretty much makes you veeery prone to be an abusive partner. In a lot of cases, an abusive partner match the criteria for BPD.  A very significant part of male/female inmates imprisioned for violent crimes fit the criteria for borderline personality too, but sadly i don't remember where i read the research.

Impulsivity and bad anger issues leads to commiting crimes. I know, it's harsh. This disorder isn't all fun and games. Sorry, but, in reality, it gets violent sometimes. The truth is: being abusive doesn't dehumanize a person. It's still a human being, and that human being has a history, a past, traumas, and almost **certainly**, a mental illness that drives their behaviors.

Unstable relationships aren't necessarily abusive, but borderline personality disorder takes it to an extreme. You can be the abuser, but you can also be the victim that can't get away because you have a crippling fear of abandonment. Something in between? I doubt, if you aren't in treatment. And i will say even more: you can imagine what this fear drive us to do. Stalking, threats of all kinds, privacy invasion. The list goes on. We aren't bad people, just mentally ill."
BPD,fq4tsaw,t1_fpxwfbz,1589084000.0,"Logically, i can say the ''same''. But emotionally, there is no ''middle'' for me. There's no half-bad or half-good, which definetly exists in reality. I would do the same things for a person after seeing her as good again. I would beg her to stay. My soul would be crushed if her leaved. First realizing bad/good characteristics of person a it's a trigger for my splitting, but once i split the first time, the cycle start. Bad/good, black/white, devil/angel. And i must say that it could start the reverse of the common idolizing perspective. I can hate a person for my first impression, and then love after knowing more, and then hating again, and then loving again, and then etc................ It's totally not a stable thing. Sometimes it's not even a reaction from their actions, it's just a thought that i have and *boom*. It happens."
BPD,fpvwgp4,t3_gfk7h2,1588953070.0,"isn't that how splitting is supposed to be? It's basically going from black to white, and from white to black again, over and over. If you can still maintain a certain bad view of a person, that's pretty solid to me."
SkyrimModsXbox,fpo3081,t3_gea2qb,1588777457.0,Wait until series X. Seriously. It is going to be much better.
BPDrecovery,fpj7vlp,t1_fpiu75q,1588659243.0,"I agree totally with that. It doesn't matter if you got hurt by the answer, if you haven't been diagnosed with BPD, you can't say you have it. As you said, borderline personality it's not something that you can discover in a simple way. That does apply to you too, as you can't know only by yourself if you have a disorder or not. 
 There are not one but several DOCTORS telling you that you don't have BPD. These are people trained to recognize it way more than you can.  If you want so much to get your dream diagnosis, then go and do it, hunt a doctor that will say what you want to hear, but i can assure you that if you are wrong, it will never work."
BPD,fpiuhcp,t1_fpif8f4,1588648996.0,"Well, talking from my perspective, as an individual, but still being part of the statistics of people with BPD, i can't say it's offensive or that you are a bad person if you do affirm that, but it would be very cool if you hold on a little before saying you have a full diagnosis.  In your case, i think your therapist is just wanting to get to know you better before giving any concrect information, and it's the right thing to do. I got diagnosed after more than a year in therapy, by both of the professionals that took care of me and had conversations about my case between them. 

 In a personal experience, i had a friend who wrongly told me she got diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder, panic syndrom and depression. After more info, i discovered that it was ''borderline traits'', and of course, we didn't relate at all. It felt totally like other experience. There was certain things she did (or the lack of) that just not fitted in any way the criteria, besides she saying that it was totally her in the phrases. The ones that she apparently did had was a reaction to the divorce of her parents that was happening at the moment. 

 But hey, your mouth is your mouth, your hand is your hand. I can't control what you say and what you type, and it would be wrong if i tried to do it. Just do what your heart finds the best. With empathy, i'm sure you can explain the things you need to very assertively. ;)"
BPD,fpi0sgn,t1_fphmmvx,1588631426.0,"Hey, it's not that way. I agree that it's not a competition. And acknowledging that a person has TRAITS can get someone on the right track. But giving a whole BPD diagnosis to someone who doesn't match at least the minimum criteria number is wrong. The thing with a group of personality traits being considered a personality disorder it's their intensity, and otherwise, they are normal unhealthy behavior, not a full blown ilness. That's my point. A disorder is a disorder, a trait is a trait."
BPD,fpgk51i,t1_fpga8r8,1588604286.0,"I have a second vision on this, and i hope you don't get me wrong. I don't want to be rude, but i do get really emotional talking about this and may come off as unkind. In my case, i match 9/9 of the criteria. I have been with the same psychotherapist for 3 years, and i have change my psychiatrist twice, but they all told me the same thing. 

 I've attempted suicide several times, and had REALLY agravatted episodes of self-harm. I've been seriously abusive to my past partners.  I've lost a lot of people because of this fucking illness. When i'm in one of my *''fits''*, my entire family suffers with me. And i can't even control it. It destroys me. It's not like *''wow, so sad, my favorite person just dumped me''*. It's pure hell. 

 I feel like considering ''minor cases'' is a disrespect for those who are struggling badly with BPD. No one experiences things the same way, but there is certainly a pattern that must be followed to match the criteria, like in all REAL DISORDERS."
BPD,fp13lq1,t3_gadzsv,1588223470.0,"The majority of those are characteristics related to the 9 diagnostic criterias of BPD. They are very compacted and have a lot of different interpretations.

 I used to feel that way too, and talked about my diagnosis with people that didn't even knew me. Then, some pretty bad things happened because of it and i had to learn to keep my mout shut. The only person that REALLY need to know about your condition it's your mental health professional. 
 In some cases, is good to tell your parents, very close friends or your partner, but always keeping in mind that you are sharing intimate information about how your mind work with someone that could use this against you. It's helpful for professionals, because they will use the knowledge to help with your treatment, but what makes you think others will do the same? As i said before, people will be jerks sometimes. And we need to deal with it."
BPD,fni1myk,t3_g1uoz1,1586972454.0,"The truth is: *no one needs to know you have a mental disorder*. People will be jerks sometimes, and we need to deal with that using assertiveness. Cry isn't going to help, scream out loud is going to increase the stigma, punching them in the face isn't a good thing to do neither as you could get your precious hand dirty with their prejudiced blood or even go to jail.

No one will automatically know you have BPD if or when you get a diagnosis, so you are completely fine as long as you don't tell anyone that *doesn't need to know it*. Also, you haven't even got diagnosed yet, so you are suffering in anticipation. Breath slowly, calm down, go see a mental health professional and treat whatever you need to and certainly, you will be fine. Biggest tip is: do not search to match a diagnostic criteria, fight to overcome it.

*You have your own unique personality and no diagnosis can make it small.*"
