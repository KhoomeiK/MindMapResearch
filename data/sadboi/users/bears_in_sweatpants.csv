psych,fnzaemd,t1_fny0nex,1587389987.0,I would disagree - I think Shawn actually being an expert marksman but giving zero cares about it is on brand for Shawn.  Similar to how he aced the police academy exam and doesn’t care.

depression,fmbb2ca,t3_fjthj0,1585922667.0,"My therapist said this to me “just know that everything you normally struggle with is going to be on steroids because of this shit”.  Ok he didn’t say “this shit” but I put that in there for you :).  It did help me to know that yes, this is harder than normal.  The feelings of the increased difficulty are real and fact based.  And.  I’m hoping all the best for you my friend.  We got this."
