Im gonna bitch and moan and get down voted to shit because I am a true Masshole. Ranting don't care abot spelllingg. 

So if I bring in those nice fancy reusable bags the cashier or bagger (if you are lucky the store has them still) will try to shove 77 items into 1-2 bags even though I brought 6-8 bags with me. Thanks for killing the eggs and bread, or mixing raw meat with fruits. 

Or if I bring cheap used plastic bags I reuse the cashier/bagger will just scan everything and ask you for money instead of help bagging the stuff up. 

WTF happened to customer service. Ive been in military commissary where the baggers work for tips and do a great job, they will even help you load the car. Ive been in food stores in the south that dont have a conveyor belt the cart opens up and the cashier takes the stuff out and scans/bags it.
