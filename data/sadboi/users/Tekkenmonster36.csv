What you describe has worked for me but recently my depression has taken over and has made it difficult to feel that way. I put on a happy face and do goofy dances to cheer up my kids but on the inside I don’t feel the same way. I am truly working on finding out what exactly is going on with me. Why I feel so sluggish and tired and just don’t want to do anything. I don’t eat often since I feel nauseous and extremely lethargic and when I do it’s always something really bland like pb and j. I feel sick eating anything else....maybe its because the change in climate maybe. It’s been raining lately and really gloomy. I just find everything so hard to do. Thanks for responding to my post and I will try my very best to stay positive. I am taking things one day at of time in hopes things change.
