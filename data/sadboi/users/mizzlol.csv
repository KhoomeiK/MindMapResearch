The man crossed the street and started walking in our direction. For some reason, this typically busy road was pretty calm at the moment. He was walking right up to us but I didn’t want to just turn around and run and, well, it was the middle of the day In a really safe suburb. What could happen?

As the man approached us he took out a knife and held it at his hip, stopping us in our tracks. He said “give me your stuff”. We both froze. The guy patted my ex down and took his wallet but when he went to pay me down, I took a few steps back, shook my head, and said “no, thank you.” I still have no idea why I reacted that way but he literally took off running right past us.
