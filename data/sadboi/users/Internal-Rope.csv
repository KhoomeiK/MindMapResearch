BreakUps,fm23fs9,t1_fm1uq1o,1585689909.0,"Going NC is a good idea, but also find a way to let the anger out, because without doing that it’ll fester and when something happens or you bump into her it’ll spill out, so I suggest maybe finding an outlet is good? Writing worked for me. And maybe boxing lol which ever suits your flare"

love,fm0w8or,t3_fsa1gi,1585667402.0,"I am not too sure if you have told her how you feel about her or not but if the latter then I think you should. If your heart truly desires more then why not chase more? You never really know till you hear it from her and maybe she feels the same way, or maybe she does not and that is okay too, you will still remain her best friend.  The fire might burn you, or you might learn to control it and then you become a wielder of flames. You could be in a different place with a single step"
BreakUps,flhwnyt,t1_flhvec9,1585170890.0,"Maybe he is not in God's plan for you, I would not really know. However what I can say is the more hope you give yourself, the greater your chances of being crushed. You can do as much as you possibly can but one thing about humans is you can not control another."
SuicideWatch,flhu1yx,t3_fovt69,1585169496.0,"That feels horrible, I understand the feeling. I think what you can do is try to change what you can. For example maybe you can try something different everyday and that might make you passionate about something and then give you direction and motivation. I know this is hard. Very hard. if you need a shout I am here. The Hole is a dark place to be in but one step at a time , maybe you can get out"
BreakUps,flhtdco,t1_flhrtmw,1585169132.0,"Well, I am not going to go for cliches here but I am sure that you are worth it and someone like him should not define your worth. I think this situation here is giving you the skills you need to be with somebody better in the future even if you do not see it. Take your time. Pour more into yourself if need be and take a break. it is okay to miss him, to cry or want him back. However if you have seen your efforts not reciprocated, then remaining that way will leave you worse"
BreakUps,flhqxm2,t3_foxek2,1585167840.0,"I really do not know what to say. I am about 4/5 months into the breakup and I sent them a gift for their birthday only to find out there is a guy who got her a much better gift and a lot more. I think this journey is a process, with small steps every day. If he is ignoring you then he is probably not worth your time"

dating_advice,fj4xzwa,t3_fbl590,1583019610.0,"I think it might be good to be concise and to the point. Ask are you dating anyone instead of stating “since when did you start dating....” because that’s an accusation and it could back fire on you terribly. Accusations form a kind of defensive reaction and even if she is the likelihood of her agreeing is little, argument will probably ensue . With just asking if she’s dating someone, you can further pressure a bit if she denies and you still want to find out. E.g she says no , you can further say maybe “ oh I was just confirming because I heard that you’ve got with ..... and it’d feel awks for me to still hang if that was the case” something of that sort. That’s what I think ;)"

heartbreak,fgjdzq4,t3_eytaqp,1580842056.0,"Hey, saw this and I understand. I do not necessarily want to give advice but to give what I genuinely think. Relationship trauma is something like plant weed, a lot of us notice it but we do not do anything to sort it out because we think it won't affect the flower(which is us or you in this situation). We remain like that till another flower grows close and the weed then actively goes onto the other flower and starts to diminish it i.e you hurting this girl you see things going far with because of someone else actions. It is very normal how you feel, and pain does make you fear revisiting that pain again. I think (as you get closer to this person) be more open about everything you have faced e.g that you have faced manipulation and that it makes you act or do certain things. Opening up creates a more productive environment slowly but surely. Also, this just might be a risk you need to take to find the path to an amazing relationship, energy does not lie and if you feel the energy and vibe you are getting is a good one it probably is. My say is go for it mate. You might get your heart hurt but do ask yourself "" the energy I am receiving from this girl, how does it make me feel? warm and cosy? or cold and ambiguous like my past relationship? "" and also ask yourself ""if I feel this girl is worth any pain that might ensue if a relationship does start"". You need to choose if you are willing to suffer pain to gain happiness with this girl

oh and p.s You are normal mate, I freeze up the same way as you. Actually I get so agitated and start boxing the driving wheel. Hope this comment is super helpful for you"

SuicideWatch,fdle1ql,t3_elzq7c,1578522026.0,"Hey, I’m sorry about what’s going on. I know it’s tough.I think what is keeping your husband going is that he has you. You are not the reason why word has not been providing hours or the wages are low or that he lost his job in May. Together I am sure you guys can give each other the comfort and strength needed in this tough time. If you need to talk more I am willing to lend an ear just to listen. I really wish it gets better"

SuicideWatch,fdgtyx6,t3_elc2qz,1578408263.0,"Hey, it seems you are having it rough and I just want you to know how you feel is normal. Your self worth is not defined by any condition you have, you are an amazing individual and you will rock those interviews... if they judge you from what they see then why would you want to go there? I’m sorry about the way you family has treated you.... If you can, maybe you can just try and focus on being the best version of you that you know how to be at these interviews, practice with somebody you know if you can as well, it could ease then tension and if anything I am rooting for you...Goodluck!"

SuicideWatch,fdggoue,t3_ela6ow,1578395993.0,"Hey friend. I sense that you’re feeling a great deal of guilt and regret and those are natural feelings to feel, you’re not a bad person for a bad action you made. Sometimes we tend to look at one misstep and forget our 1000 progressive steps. I can’t say whether you should come clean or not that is genuinely up to you. She’s been around for 5 years and that means she sees something more to you than you could ever see and that’s beautiful. You donated to charities and everything. You are a good person, who just made a mistake, and you know what that makes you? A human being.... and that is okay. Anything that happens from now I’m supporting you because I can see that you’re not a bad person... just a human being who is dealing with a lot"
SuicideWatch,fde20s8,t1_fde1biq,1578329399.0,"Everybody is different, like an amazing piece of a puzzle. That mental ward did not work for you but maybe something else will. A different therapist for example, or maybe just even talking to someone daily about how you feel. It can be difficult to believe people love you, I know how it feels....do you perhaps have any family members? I am care for you and hence I am here with you"

SuicideWatch,fddmk35,t3_ekty9k,1578317837.0,"Hey friend, you made a mistake, your feelings got the best of you. That doesn’t make you a bad person, you just made a bad action. And that’s okay, what you could do is explain to her why you said what you send in a non argumentative way - suggestion to do that would be that, you say how you feel and why the certain action made you feel that way without blaming e.g ‘I was deeply hurt and agitated because I couldn’t prove to you how much you meant to me and in turn made you think that I was using you when in truth I was not’ and be prepared to listen more than you speak. You matter my friend and your feelings matter as well and they need to be expressed and vented about. I am here to be that outlet for the negative feelings and try help you in anyway I can. I also lost my gf recently so I can see how you feel. Please speak to me if you feel that you can. Much love T"

SuicideWatch,fddi309,t3_ekt2ta,1578313182.0,"Hey, I have seen your other posts and I can tell you’re really having it tough. You do not need to paint a smile on your face because the more you cover up your pain, the stronger it gets. Maybe if you could explain to your parents how exactly you feel, being an only child must be hard to because you have no one to speak to at home so often you get a feeling of dissociation....I am here to talk to you if you want... you said you told a someone in chat how you feel, what games do you play? Do you maybe have call of duty online and we can play together? I’d love to talk to you some more and really understand how you feel because how you feel is normal. Or whatever game you have that will help you get your mind off things"
