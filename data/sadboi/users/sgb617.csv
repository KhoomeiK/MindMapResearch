whiskey,fqocgdi,t3_gjy23m,1589512158.0,Excellent first! I’m enjoying a glass of it right now.
rccars,fqoa8zx,t1_fqo43lu,1589510812.0,"How are the stock electronics on traxxas? I have had bad luck with Chinese copies wigging out and losing signal constantly so I was thinking of getting one and upgrading the transmitter and receiver, but that just puts it close to the price of something in the traxxas line and feels like pointless extra steps."
rccars,fqmw0v2,t1_fqmqxod,1589484467.0,"Perfect, that’s what I was wondering. I figured receivers and transmitters had to be paired together"
rccars,fqmpxog,t1_fqmomr0,1589481547.0,You mean the receiver is specific to the car?
rccars,fqmllos,t1_fqmj2tl,1589479470.0,I know very little about RC..are pretty much all transmitters and receivers compatible with all cars? Even the cheaper Chinese ones?
rccars,fqmgg8w,t3_gjoi71,1589477040.0,Well I have already returned both trucks thinking they were faulty but I guess it’s just a quirk of some you have to deal with. Thanks for the input. Do you have a recommendation on electronics for when I get the next car?
whiskey,fqmd45g,t3_gjmtt2,1589475467.0,"I love it. I don’t drink it often because I can’t find it near me and don’t want to be without. I have this, EH Taylor small batch, and eagle rare right now in rotation. And a bottle of Blanton’s Gold that I’m waiting to open when I close on my house."
rccars,fqmcqy8,t1_fqm9vzb,1589475296.0,I also got a Hosim with the same kinds of issues as the haiboxing. I assumed it’s just cheap Chinese car problems. Would it be worth it to get a cheaper car like one of those and upgrade the electronics?
rccars,fqm7bet,t1_fqm5mzm,1589472727.0,Got a haiboxing for my son and it had major communication issues. Might have just gotten a bad one.

ZephyrusG14,fqcekfw,t1_fqb7y94,1589256287.0,Could the hdmi out on this be used with the built in port to run dual monitors? (Or 3 including the laptop display)
ZephyrusG14,fqceev0,t3_ghvn6s,1589256182.0,So glad I came upon this thread. I was just looking for a dock this morning while I wait for my G14 to arrive next week.

rccars,fq88pru,t1_fq88hks,1589160768.0,I’ve actually heard really good things about those. Totally forgot about them. Thanks
rccars,fq86wyv,t1_fq851oz,1589159731.0,I’ve already set up a return for this car. I’m trying to keep the price down as much as it can while still getting something decent. Do you have a recommendation? Seems like the sub $200 are really pretty limited to a 2wd Slash.
rccars,fq862fk,t1_fq85k2m,1589159237.0,That’s kind of what I was thinking. I was considering buying higher capacity batteries but it seems like it would just run longer then start wigging out.
tipofmyjoystick,fpx1uqd,t1_fpveuyk,1588974079.0,Wow I completely forgot about this game! Thanks for reminding me it existed. So many hours spent in my youth.

Amiibomb,fp64oun,t3_gbdu0h,1588346018.0,How do you get the corners cut so perfectly?
blackstonegriddle,fp4oqj6,t1_fp4l14z,1588303743.0,This. I’ve had issues with my flax seasoned griddle chipping all over. I did a partial sand down and seasoned again with canola and it’s been way better. Still need to fully strip it and start clean but I can’t take enough time off cooking on it to do it.

OculusQuest,fnelxeb,t1_fnejsa7,1586891716.0,Thank you for the reply. I’ll edit my post with addition info and create an imgur album in a few.
OculusQuest,fnej1jn,t1_fneimdl,1586890250.0,That’s kinda where my thought process was going. Not trying to majorly price gouge but not trying to lose money on a device in high demand that I may not be able to rebuy when my financial situation is better.
OculusQuest,fnei3ig,t3_g1b364,1586889769.0,Yeah the only problem with eBay is their fees. And then PayPal’s fees on top of that.
OculusQuest,fnehz2f,t3_g1b364,1586889706.0,"I haven’t really planned on any specific platform to sell it. Just decided today really. It’s from a corona free and heavily quarantined household but yeah, that’s just my word so...it could easily be disinfected when the person buys it if it makes them feel better."

piano,fmuie9l,t1_fmuf3of,1586392013.0,"Thanks for you reply! I’m not looking to go down any particular music path. I mostly want to be able to hear a song I like, and then pick up the sheet music and learn it, regardless of genre. My daughter started playing last summer and I would love to be able to play with her. She’s learning from a teacher so maybe I’ll go back and follow her homework. It’s basically just been learning the notes, finger numbers, scales (just c for now), and a few easy-ish songs. I know in the past I’ve followed online guitar learning videos like Justin Guitar and liked them. I was just curious if there was any free sources like a particular YouTube channel that can help me as I self teach. Formal lessons aren’t really in my budget right now."
vita,fmq2ab8,t3_fwnssv,1586291569.0,I would definitely go for the HORI grip if you can find a deal. I can’t believe it’s $140+. I bought it two years ago for $32.99 on Amazon...
piano,fmpy5iv,t3_fwk98b,1586289453.0,Very inspiring! I’m about to start playing as an adult and hope I’m able to play as well as you after 3 months.
whiskey,fmk987s,t1_fmk5pfu,1586147873.0,It’s up to the person. I say drink it however you like it. I used to drink my whiskey cheap and with cola. Now I prefer it neat or on the rocks and don’t really enjoy it mixed as much.

TriCitiesWA,fmacvzq,t1_fma6is6,1585890122.0,Yeah this is kind of how I’m thinking. This is a new virus and a lot we don’t know still. I mean it was just introduced and look at the damage it has done.

CoronavirusWA,fm9u4ut,t1_fm9tviz,1585876625.0,A big problem and reason for extending in the first place is that a large number of people aren’t listening already.
CoronavirusWA,fm9tgsv,t1_fm9sz2y,1585876197.0,My job is borderline essential. But that’s just my department. We should be shut with a handful of people on call for emergencies. There is a large department that’s not essential at all and they are still working as normal. Hanging out during lunch. Working side by side all day. No masks. I’m the only person at my company who seems to be taking this very seriously.
TriCitiesWA,fm9stst,t1_fm9so10,1585875785.0,I heard that on the news as well. But I also was reading there is no proof that it is actually effective in eliminating the virus. So I’m torn. Leaning toward just preparing my own meals for now though...
CoronavirusWA,fm5y63w,t1_fm5medf,1585782363.0,"I feel weird too but I’m doing it. Was wearing one all day at work. The only person. 20ish other people working in fairly close proximity to each other and acting like everything is normal. Sitting and having lunch as a group in the break room.

No fancy bells and whistles, just a good piano experience. I got it for $450 from Sweetwater with bench, folding stand, and headphones. I know it’s outside your price range, but I got it at 0% interest for 3 years. $14 a month is pretty easy to handle."

CoronavirusWA,fl6fbix,t1_fl6deh1,1584866262.0,"You clearly missed the point. There was a ton of space, yet this family planted themselves right where we were and walked right up to my daughter. To think everyone should hold up in their homes 24/7 is unrealistic. It’s a matter of using common sense and maintaining a safe distance."
CoronavirusWA,fl65nsr,t3_fmugyw,1584855266.0,Went for a bike ride with my family today. Ended up at the park by the river. Found a spot to sit and have lunch with nobody around. Then another family shows up and it’s hanging about 20 feet from us. This was fine until the mother and her toddler decided to walk the beach right up to where my daughter was throwing rocks. So we packed up and left. So much for trying to go get some fresh air and exercise. People are fucking l stupid and selfish.

TriCitiesWA,fkexdrs,t3_fi3j72,1584122666.0,I could see it happening. But I picture a bunch of foreclosures and houses going to auction. Which doesn’t help the average buyer since they generally require payment in full and you can’t finance them.

IpodClassic,fjyf7t0,t3_fbij1f,1583695451.0,I could be wrong but is there no point in using FLAC with the stock unmodded headphone jack? As far as I have read the only time FLAC is beneficial is when using the line out on a 5.5 with the enhanced DAC. Again I would be happy to be corrected but seems like an unnecessary use of space (not like you’re lacking with the one 1tb)
