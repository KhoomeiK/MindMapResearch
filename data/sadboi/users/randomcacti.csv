findapath,ff4ikow,t1_ff4i40d,1579564473.0,"I think this describes it very well ""As a Respiratory Therapist, you may think I am just a person that gives breathing treatments all day.  While I do, I also have a lot of other things that fall under my job title. In case you didn‚Äôt know, I am my patients airway! When they can‚Äôt breathe, I am the person you want at the bedside. Most people have no idea what a respiratory therapist is, let alone what they do!  

Let me give you an idea! 

An RT is the person that maintains the life support. We control every aspect of the ventilator. We are taught to know exactly what is happening and our goal is to get them off of life support as soon as possible, to give them their best chance at a normal life.

We do a breathing treatment in one room and remove the tube from a dying patients lungs in the next room. 

With a room full of crying eyes on us, knowing they will never forget our face, because we are the person removing the only thing that is keeping their loved one alive. 

We hold our composure while doing so, to cause as little stress on our patients family as possible. We empathize and put ourself in their position. 

We sometimes walk from the room in tears because 18 years wasn‚Äôt long enough for anyone. 

We also, remain in the room at times and hold their hand as they take their last breath, because they have no family to be there with them. 

We do exams alongside MD‚Äôs that determine whether a patient is brain dead. Those patients really stick with us and some of us end up crying the entire ride home.

We assist one on one with Doctors doing bronchoscopy‚Äôs, insertion of SWAN GANZ catheters, we place A-lines, we change Trach‚Äôs,  and draw arterial blood gases.  

When a patient has no heart beat and the only thing between life and death is CPR, we are at the head of the bed, we place the airway, we ensure that it is in the correct position and give them manual breaths. 

Sometimes we breathe for them for five minutes and sometimes its an hour and twenty minutes and our finger tips are literally hurting. 

We deal with gun shot victims, stabbings, cardiac arrests, car crashes, motorcycle crashes, inhalation burns, asthmatics, and so many more. 

We see things that most people can‚Äôt stomach. 

We have to know so many different diseases (COPD, Asthma, emphysema, ARDS, Cystic Fibrosis just to name a few) how to treat them, what medicine will help and work for each patient and are we doing everything possible to ensure the patient is getting better. 

We have patients that range from 22 weeks gestation to over one hundred years old.

We work long shifts and often take our work home with us. 
We lie awake thinking about the patient we just can‚Äôt turn around and ask ourselves if there was anything we could have done different.    

We work beside doctors, pharmacists, NP‚Äôs, PA‚Äôs, nurses, medics, EMT‚Äôs, PCA‚Äôs.  (I‚Äôm positive I‚Äôm forgetting others!)"""
