but obviously the safest option and the only one that‚Äôs full proof is to sneak out, so OP should either sneak out at night or if they can‚Äôt, just don‚Äôt risk it. or just find away to hide the smell. if OP can just go out into your backyard and spark. 

someone suggested the smoke buddy, which is very helpful. a homemade sploof works well too tho.

edit: this is just from my experience tho so it might be different from the majority of smokers."
trees,fqp5gf0,t1_fqooxxj,1589535698.0,"idk what your living situation is but as long as you close the vents in your room, open the windows, turn on a fan, and put a blanket against your door you‚Äôll be fine. the smell of weed goes away in like 4 hours, so if you do it around 12 or 1 you‚Äôll be fine. 

you could also hotbox your closet if it‚Äôs big enough. it‚Äôll keep the smell localized in one area. put a blanket against the door and take your clothes out of the closet. it‚Äôs no the most comfortable way to spark, but it works really well. 

last resort is to just find a way to sneak out, or say you‚Äôre going for a ‚Äúwalk‚Äù and do it somewhere out of the way during the day."

EDIT: Guess I should also mention two things. The attic is actually in my room in this little cupboard with a wooden plank that covers it.

17(M) I‚Äôm pretty chill but can be energetic when I‚Äôm hanging out with friends. I can pretty much talk to anyone (even though I have social anxiety which makes things a bit complicated) and usually change to match other people which creates some conflict with my identity (been getting better with being myself though). I‚Äôm pretty reserved and don‚Äôt really approach people, but am nice to people and willing to talk if they approach me. I play guitar, listen to a lot of music, make art, read a lot, and play a lot of Fallout 4.

. Is there any medical diagnosis that may impact your mental instability somehow? 

Depression, Anxiety, and OCD (the holy trinity)

. Describe your upbringing

Grew up in a liberal Maryland suburb with a stable home life and was given a lot of independence. I‚Äôm mixed (Indian-White) and the Indian side of my family all live in the same area as us so I‚Äôve always been the closest with them, although some of the stereotypical Indian conventions have impacted me at some points in my life.

. What do you do as a job or as a career?

Right now I‚Äôm working at a gardening supplies store to save up for college and stuff like that. Ideally I want to get into politics or work in public policy or in a  think tank, but my dream job is to make enough money and be successful enough to pursue music full time.

. If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? 

Fucking amazing especially if my dog is with me.

. How curious are you? Do you have more ideas than you can execute?

I‚Äôm very curious and like reading up on a variety of things from history to politics to science. I‚Äôm always coming up with new ideas, but end up forgetting about them before I can write them down. When I was little I‚Äôd always be making and building things my parents say I was very creative.

. Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position

Depends on how daunting the task is and how big my team is but I usually do.

. Are you coordinated?

Despite being able to play guitar pretty well I trip about 15 times a day.

. Are you artistic?

I‚Äôd say so. The music I make tends to jump around a lot but usually stays under the indie, hardcore, and emo umbrella. My lyrics are usually about love, girls, and other personal stuff like that but I end up scrapping most of my songs. I also make beats and a few people from my school have used them in their songs. Usually just generic trap beats. I don‚Äôt draw and paint as much as I used to but it‚Äôs either realistic or very impressionistic. I used to write a lot when I was younger and wrote a whole trilogy of books about anthropomorphic toy army men. I haven‚Äôt written a short story or anything like that in a while, but I do write poetry from time to time which tends to be very free verse and abstract. My approach to things artistically is that I artistic intent is essentially meaningless in my work. The art I make does mean something specifically to me but my goal is to create art that resonates with other people in their own unique way and can find meaning based on stuff going on in their life at the moment.

. What‚Äôs your opinion about the past, present, and future?

Nostalgia can be a negative emotion for me. I can resort to the past a lot when I‚Äôm feelings down, and little things always remind me of some of the best moments of my life, but at points in my life when I‚Äôm in a really dark place those great memories sort of taunt me. I also tend to go on severe guilt trips when I remember the mistakes I‚Äôve made in the past and the people I‚Äôve hurt. Recently, one of these trips caused me to spiral into a very very severe depression but I think I‚Äôm over it now. I barely spend any time in the present, and most of the time I‚Äôm living in the future. Daydreaming, coming up with new ideas, and what not.

. How do you act when others request your help?

I try to help them out ofc :) I really don‚Äôt see any reason to not help someone out unless you think they‚Äôre trying to trick you into something.

. Do you need logical consistency in your life?

Yes a huge part of my worldview is based off of logical consistency. I‚Äôd say 40% is based off of how I objectively view things and the other 60% is subjective or spiritual.

. How important is efficiency and productivity important to you?

Extremely important. I micro manage everything to achieve maximum efficiency and try to find the best methods to achieve it. For example, I always mow my yard in the direction of the axis (x,y; think of it as the whole yard being a coordinate grid) that is the longest because if I were to mow in the direction of the axis that is the shortest, then I‚Äôd be wasting more time turning the lawn mower around because I‚Äôd have to make more rotations to start my next mowing row. I do this efficiency analysis for every single job/chore I do basically. A lot of this is driven by my perfectionism. If someone tells me to do something I‚Äôve analyzed another way I get kind of offended and won‚Äôt do it their way because I‚Äôve concluded that my way is the most efficient and is the best for me.

. Do you control others? Why?

Sometimes indirectly because I feel like I have to be in control of everything in my life and everything has to go perfectly and according to plan.

. What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with the most? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?

I learn best via reading texts. I really struggle and hate really tight and controlled environments where everything must be done according to one person‚Äôs standards and there‚Äôs no room for any opposing viewpoints or free thinking. I prefer classes that involve creativity and logic the most because I have a terrible memory and I don‚Äôt like doing anything physical ever so.

. How good are you at strategizing? Are you good at breaking up tasks into manageable parts, or do you usually wing projects

It depends. If I have some sort of big assignment or deadline to meet then I‚Äôll break it up into manageable parts (even though I usually don‚Äôt stick to the plan), but most of the time I wing things. Especially if they‚Äôre creative projects. I feel like if you have some sort of strict formula for creating art then it‚Äôs nit really true self expression. For me I usually get really good results from just winging it and letting whatever‚Äôs inside of me just come out naturally. It feels like genuine art to me.

. What are your aspirations in life?

Looking past my specific career goals and life goals, in general I just want to be remembered as a really kind soul who looked out for everyone and was dedicated to their cause/craft. That and putting out a successful album would be dope.

. What are your fears?

Way too many to face but my biggest are: failure, being seen as a disappointment, being seen as worthless, being seen as mean and unlikeable, feeling trapped and hopeless, and loneliness.

. What do the ‚Äúhighs‚Äù in your life look like?

I‚Äôm really ambitious, charismatic, have a dry sense of humor, have a nice small circle of friends, I‚Äôm dating a nice girl, I‚Äôm creating a lot, and my grades are looking alright

. What do the ‚Äúlows‚Äù of your life look like

Loneliness, isolation, massive spike in depression, intense guilt trips, substance abuse, sense of worthlessness and hopelessness, barely getting out of bed, not having the energy to do anything, and depersonalization. 

. How attached are you to reality?

I never am I day dream all the time my parents used to call me an absent minded professor when I was younger. If I‚Äôm hanging out with friends or with my girlfriend then I‚Äôll be more in the present but when I‚Äôm by myself I can never get out of my head.

. Imagine you are alone in a blank, empty room. There is nothing for you to do and no one to talk to. What do you think about?

Why am I in this room? How long will I be in this room? Is there a way out of this room? What if I never get out of this room? What if this is like a social experiment? Am I even in what I know as the universe right now? Is my family ok? Is my dog ok?

. How long do you take to make an important decision? Do you change your mind once you‚Äôve made it?

Forever or I give up and don‚Äôt decide and yes all the time.

. How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?

They‚Äôre extremely important to me and I have a tendency to wallow in my emotions. It can take anywhere between a week or a few months for me to process them.

. Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to keep the conversation going?

Yes all the time and it kills me because I feel like I‚Äôm not expressing my true self when I do that.

. Do you break rules often? Do you think authority should be challenged?

Only the unnecessary ones and yes always.

depression,erg438i,t3_c1w9az,1560825843.0,"Ok well if your partner thinks that then he‚Äôs a piece of shit or at least extremely ignorant towards mental health issues.

I don‚Äôt cut but I do burn myself, and I do it for the same reason you do it. I feel like I‚Äôm a terrible person, that all I‚Äôve done is hurt people and have mistreated them. So, I burn myself to punish myself. So I can inflict the same pain I inflicted upon them, upon myself. 

I don‚Äôt know your exact situation, but I know that a few events in my life really triggered this intense feeling of guilt and self hatred prompting me to start doing this. This guilt also made me isolate myself of everyone, because I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve happiness and shouldn‚Äôt be close to anyone. The thing is I know that my attitude towards these events is extremely irrational and that my worldview is flawed because the people I think I‚Äôve hurt our doing much better than me now and some of them have forgiven me and have tried to reconnect with me.

I know I need to start that slow arduous process of loving myself because NO ONE deserves to punish themselves, and those who do, even though I don‚Äôt see this in myself, are the most considerate and wonderful people on this plan. They care enough about other people and about events in their life that they feel the need to punish themselves because they believe they are terrible people and have done something wrong when in fact, this very belief proves that they are not and is only destroying their actually wonderful personality.

I don‚Äôt have experience with BPD but I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs some meds that can help with that. Do you have a therapist or psych? I know it‚Äôs hard to stop self harming, I‚Äôm just coming off it and I know what you mean when you say the pain is kind of comforting, and for me there‚Äôs something really satisfying about those burn marks, but you can‚Äôt give in to that oddly grotesque but warm feeling because you‚Äôre only destroying yourself. Please get help you deserve it, and again sorry about your partner.

Hope you get better :)"
depression,erg2ulh,t3_c1wgre,1560824833.0,"This sounds kind of cliche, and it‚Äôs definitely not a permanent solution, but if you‚Äôre ever overwhelmed by depression you should try mindfulness. Honestly it‚Äôs helped me a lot and it‚Äôs saved me from doing a lot of dumb impulsive stuff because of depression. I know it sucks and sometimes (most of the time) depression really knocks you down and there seems like there‚Äôs no point to life but fighting is always a better option than giving up. The universe is constantly moving away from its origin and one day, scientists theorize, it will collapse in on itself. We are lucky to be alive right now when such catastrophic and existentially depressing circumstances aren‚Äôt a threat to us. So cherish that you were born now, here, with so much potential in every aspect of your life. You deserve to be free from this suffering, and it may not seem like it but it‚Äôs only temporary. Suffering only breeds triumph."
