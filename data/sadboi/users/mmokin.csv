tressless,f92j0s2,t3_e37b8d,1575033190.0,I don't think the topical steroid would interact with fin but since topical steroids are a short term treatment maybe you should wait until you no longer use the topical before starting fin

Mewing,f6xe4vm,t1_f6x1r5h,1573247745.0,"yeh it took me a couple of months before i started to lose facial bloat but it was mostly bodyfat, keep it up and progress will come"
Mewing,f6wkznq,t1_f6wbf0s,1573228994.0,"Check what your body fat percentage is if it is already 15-22% then you should drink a lot more water, reduce any salt and sugar in your diet and always tongue swallow (don't use your cheek muscles for anything)
There are more radical solutions like buccal fat removal or liposuction but you should try everything else first.
Also keep an eye on any medication you are taking especially ones that regulate blood pressure as they are known to increase water retention."
Mewing,f6w7mux,t3_dte1x0,1573219158.0,"from the picture right side looks better

you look like you have good bone structure try your best to lose facial bloat it will help make you look a lot better

also make sure you tongue swallow"
