But if you’re against cakey makeup, or makeup takes too much time, then I suggest the bare minimum:

1) Mascara (or fake eyelashes)
2) Blush
3) Tinted lip balm ( I loooovvvvveee tarte quench lip rescue)

I love full blown glam, but when I’m in a rush or just running a quick errand these few items help me feel much more like a lady 😊"

This is a product that helps though! https://www.laroche-posay.us/face-and-body-skin-care/face-products/eye-cream/pigmentclar-eye-cream-for-dark-circles-3337872414152.html

It’s just a mild color corrector, not permanent correction, but there’s definitely a difference. Especially when you put concealer over it! Best part is it doesn’t irritate my sensitive eyes 😊"
SkincareAddiction,fl7sigg,t3_fmtvqe,1584908440.0,"Maybe what you’re using could be too harsh for your acne.

What worked for me is:

~ Skincare ~
1) Vanicream Gentle Facial Cleanser
2) Vanicream Lite Lotion
3) The Ordinary Niacinamide & Zinc
4) EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 Sunscreen - Untinted

~ Makeup ~
Jane Iredale PurePressed Base Mineral Foundation is my HOLY GRAIL foundation. It is makeup that is meant to be worn post skin care procedures. It has made my skin clearer, offers coverage, never caused a breakout, and looks like my skin but better.

~ Other things that help ~
1) Changing your pillowcase ever week (or every few days)
2) Washing your pillowcase (and clothing too in my preference) with fragrance free detergent and no fabric softener. Just make sure whatever you’re using is fragrance free because fragrance IS NOT skincare!

Hope this helps you and anyone else on your skincare journey! 💕"

Appearances DO matter, they’re our first impressions. But they’re not the lasting impact. 

I know it’s cheesy but you really do need to love yourself before you can love or even be noticed by someone else.

Hold your head up, be yourself, find what makes you stand out from the crowd.

(Side note: if it makes you feel any better, there are people out there who I consider (not shallow) but they have a type. I’ve crushed on and dated some guys that people DID NOT find attractive at all. But it didn’t bother me because they were my type, and at the end of the day the most important thing is what’s on the inside.)

Give yourself more credit, give yourself more love, don’t take things too seriously.

Your time will come 🤗"

But there’s so much that goes on inside that people don’t see. That’s why I’m always kind to people. You never know what’s going on in their life.
