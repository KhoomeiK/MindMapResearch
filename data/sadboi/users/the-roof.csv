autism,fqcmbrk,t3_ghvn6a,1589262097.0,"I have autism and I am hyper sensitive to sound light smell and touch.

About the smell, for me it's very annoying. I can smell my own body odours, other people, I hate perfume and flowers and I really hate the smell of food.

The only smells I like are petrichor and fresh laundry.

I could smell the oven going into failure a few days before it was really over (that electrical smell) and I smell when there is a mouse in the house.

My parents lived in an old house and my mom used to ask me to smell whether there was probably a mouse, or if there was a problem with drainage or anything.

I can't be near people eating. Drinking depends on the beverage. I choose specific cleaning stuff based on smell.

In public transport I find a different place if there are smells from people consuming food or drinks or having bad body odour.

I have learned a few things however. If you don't know how to react or what to say, just look friendly and try to smile a little. I never did that and I was perceived as being very arrogant.
Also, when going into a social situation, I think of an excuse to get away when things get uncomfortable, for instance awkward silences.

The sessions indeed sound not good. The questions seem hurtful and just saying bluntly ""you have ptsd"" sounds not good either, because diagnosing someone should be a process taken carefully.

I think you can bring it up with your psychologist. I did that as well, I am in a similar situation. My psychologist said I then should better just talk to the psychiatrist about meds and all the other stuff with her. Also when issues arise I should discuss it with her and she can explain to me or discuss with the psychiatrist. 

If no solution can be found, is there another psychiatrist you can switch to? I can't unfortunately because here in the Netherlands there are not enough psychiatrists, let alone who speak Dutch properly.

 However in my mental health journey I have met different psychiatrists and even on their specialization: meds, they differ quite a lot on opinions. I mention this because you say so far only benzos help for you , but benzos are addicting and the more you need the less they work. After that, you can get bad withdrawal symptoms which ironically increase anxiety. I had this too. Eventually I got another med that in my case helped a lot (Quetiapine, a form of atypical antipsychotics, sometimes also used in low dosages for non psychotic related stuff such as anxiety ) Note: I am no professional!

Also parents need to consider whether they are capable of taking care of a handicapped child (actually for taking care of any child actually)

I also think there is nothing wrong with putting a child in a specialised institution. There are often good carers there, and a lot of specialised adjustments. For instance, a deaf-blind individual needs a special kind of communication and has needs that might be difficult to adjust to for the parents whereas an institution is specialised for such care.

Also I have a dog and she is my best friend, therefore I don't feel lonely being at home all the time.

If you feel you are not happy in your situation, maybe you can try and find people (online) with the same interests? That should make it easier to get a conversation going.

And most of all, don't compare yourself with other seemingly very popular people. I did that as a teenager and it made me very unhappy. Now I just do what feels comfortable to me.

If you feel you can't do it yourself and seek help with family or friends or as you say your SO, it is better to find a professional.

self,fnrfl86,t3_g3gpjb,1587187468.0,"Good that you notice what happens and that the solution is not to drink all the time! 
I am no expert, but I think when people drink, for most people it makes them less insecure. Is it possible that you are a bit insecure when sober? Drinking doesn't acquire you the skills to have good social conversations, it makes you feel more at ease so your skills show more than when hidden by insecurities. 
Noticing that you have the skills when you drink means you have the skills! It just shows then. Probably by making you feel more at ease.
Maybe you can find a way to improve your confidence in a sober way? If you were always introverted, that is a process.
Also, keep in mind things don't have to be black and white. If you feel you want more social contact than being completely isolated, you don't have to become the opposite of yourself. There are in between ways.
I am extremely introverted myself. However, over the years I got a few friends who I can talk with. No parties and such because that is not for me, but just occasional contact when I feel like it."

What helped me get through it eventually (well I still have a chronic depression but am not severely suicidal anymore) was getting a safe place to live and getting my dog. I know I have to live for her and make her happy. She comforts me and gives me moments of joy.

autism,fn99d3z,t3_g0bii3,1586764119.0,"I think it is a very unkind way of saying it from your mom.

Personally, I don't think people with autism should have kids. Including myself, even though I like kids. 

This is because I can't fulfill their social emotional needs (how should I teach them social stuff? Comfort them? Explaining them complex social behaviour I don't understand myself?)

One of the criteria of an autism diagnosis is that it impacts your life on different areas. I know there are autistic parents, but if people say they can be parents regardless of their autism, my personal thought is: either you don't qualify the criteria for a diagnosis, or you are not going to be the parent they need."

My current therapist and other professionals say it's okay to cry, to process emotions.

depression,fmvcrs5,t3_fxdphs,1586412604.0,"I have chronic depression but I had severe major depressive episode for over five years.
I don't think with me the problem is 'chemical' Antidepressants even in high dosage only take off the sharp edge a bit.
My traumatic experiences in the past and personal traits have caused it I think. Also I am a pessimist by nature and I overthink everything until it ends in a dystopia.
What helped for me is getting a pet (in my case a dog). I was often advised to do mindfulness but I couldn't do it. However, my dog teaches me to do this very easily. I just have to watch her enjoy her walks, her sticks, looking for birds, and I have little moments of joy myself.
Also I am a perfectionist by nature. I found an online course I want to do and have some plans for work I want to do but with no pressure (pressure causes anxiety and makes depression worse) so I didn't make a deadline. I am not worried about it taking too long because without a deadline I can keep working, with a deadline I will.. freeze?

deaf,fmo60ak,t3_fw6shb,1586246657.0,"Maybe the parents are in denial?

My parents found out I was permanently nearly deaf when I was four (meaning it wasn't just fluid as they thought) because with one of the regular children's health checks a pediatrician who was HoH herself raised concerns.
I got a hearing aid and nearly no support other than I didn't have to do listening tests and new teachers got explanation. I felt excluded all the time. Everyone thought it was okay because I got good grades, but that was only because I was good at self study.

So I know the importance of parents taking it seriously and supporting their children.

Maybe it is good for the parents to have examples of why the teacher has those concerns. Also, maybe it is good to let it sink in a bit, let the parents think about it a bit, and invite them to talk about it again later. Give them a couple of days or weeks to think about it, because their initial reaction is denial, they still may be set to think about it and confronted with when they go notice themselves.
I often read stories about parents initially denying their childs hearing loss but acknowledge later.

It also may be important to give the parents information on how to proceed from there, and that it is necessary to take action in order to give their child a happy and fulfilling future. They may know nothing about that

I also think parents, when they find out an issue with their child, they refuse to believe their child is 'defective'. It shouldn't be considered so obviously but parents often think that (what I read from blogs and experience stories)"

autism,fm7jti4,t3_ftgbnz,1585829389.0,"Autism can be a disability in society, when everyone expects everyone to be average. The first people on earth would survive with autism but they wouldn't without legs because they wouldn't be able to run from predators. But one could argue that someone with a prosthetic leg wouldn't classify him or her self with being disabled nowadays.
It is a matter of syntax and connotations.
Personally I find the world disabled quite negative. It suggests that one can't do anything. In Dutch we use the word 'beperking' which I find better because literally translated it means limitation. That suggests more that someone can do things, but with some limitations. 
After all, this kind of things is personal. Some people feel offended when people say disability or disorder. Other people then feel validated.

I hope I explained my opinion well since English isn't my first language."
