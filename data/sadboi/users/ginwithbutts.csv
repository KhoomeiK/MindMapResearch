dating_advice,foq4jnq,t3_g8mf3x,1587982746.0,"PSA: It’s perfectly okay to feel hungry and want food   

I’m an avid Reddit user and so I browse many subreddits and in doing so I often see many threads about people wanting to find food, getting hunger pangs etc, especially now during quarantine.    

The problem is I keep seeing the same tired advice like “focus on yourself” or “you can’t eat to fill a void and make you happy”  blah blah.   

These statements just don’t speak truth to the harsh reality that we  are all humans and as such we crave food, water and  sustenance. Some are able to get these things easier than others and  these are usually the people trying to give the advice.   

There is nothing wrong with wanting to vent and feel hungry, it’s perfectly normal. Another aspect that I think people tend to ignore is  the fact that societal pressure makes everything 10x harder to deal with. You listen to the radio and all you hear are songs about food and drinking, you go outside in public and see all those couples eating at restaurants and laughing, you hangout with your friends and they all bring their a snack and you just have to sit by yourself...the list goes on and on making you feel worse.   

Just imagine putting these people down and telling them “focus on being a better applicant for jobs” as if there is something wrong with them in the first place. We are who we are and there is someone out there who will appreciate that. There are tons of individuals out there with good looks, happy family, no mental issues, shredded bodies and yet still hungry... why you ask; Because There is way more to life and finding nourishment than just saying “get a job.”   

Honestly for those that are struggling right now with being hungry, both men and women, don’t worry about it because I’m right there with you and here to give you some hope. THERE IS food out there waiting to be eaten by you, I promise! Just hang in there and continue to be yourself. Don’t change who you are for a bit of bread.    
While this is definitely a great time to pickup new hobbies or perhaps fit in some regular exercise, do those things because you truly want to, not because you think it will help you get food."
