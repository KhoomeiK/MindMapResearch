So much love to all of you whom are most definitely the polar opposite to that evil person. I stopped doing it a long time ago but I used to think that I took a life in my previous life or something incredibly sinister (the giver of some sort of horrific abuse to another, something demented, etc.). Like I was walking a fine line, continually being aware of my possible horrific past - having actual guilt over it - and doing anything I could from becoming a monster again. It was the only thing that made sense to me. Why else why my mother hate me? Mother's don't usually hate their babies. 
Eventually, I resigned hope to being any thing like any God would want in their heaven. I really like weed. Too bad."

Fuck anyone who hurts you like that. I was so scared of dealing with my mom that I would have endured anything or done anything to avoid it.

Please take care and maybe, if you can, find somewhere else to stay (avoid new romance situations tho please). That's what I did. Whatever you do, be safe. Something that I've realized is that you're going to feel just as alone with them as you would not living with them or on your own completely - you just don't have to take their shit on as much of a regular basis. And if you hear any crap from them about you wrecking the family or whatever, they are so wrong. You didn't, they did. You're just get to be the target for all their anger projections cause they are too scared to own their shit and/or confront the guilty party and seek the validation/justice you deserve.

I met with a psychiatrist, did an assessment, he needed time to think about my diagnosis so he requested a follow up. Went to the follow up. I for sure had BPD, he said and he put me on a year long waiting list for gvnt funded DBT treatment. I finally had some validation but by the end of it he was telling me he didn't need to see me anymore cause I was sick enough. I would have been punished for self harm as a kid so I wouldn't do it in a visible or reactive way. He wasn't concerned about me because I wasn't in the ER every week, doing physical damage to myself. 
I really didn't like him so that's fine but it just ate at me. Still is really. I've been dealing with this for over 30 yrs and within an hour, I went from feeling really sure of things to ""oh, I am even making too big a deal of this to the psychiatrist"" so I got out of there as fast as I could cause I felt like I was wasting his time.
