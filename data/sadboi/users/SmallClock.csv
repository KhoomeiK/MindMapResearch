Justin Lee (gay Christian) wrote a book called Talking Across the Divide. He uses the metaphor of someone’s beliefs being a branched tree. It’s easier to change one of the leaves (“I cannot be in relationship with my child because their life is immoral”) than one of the branches close to the trunk (“the Bible is inerrant”). 

Danny Cortez, a Southern Baptist preacher who lost his following when he came out affirming queer people. He talks about a meeting with two of his former church members where they said, “we can’t support you because we believe you’re doing the Devil’s work and corrupting the Church.” Danny responded, “I get that you can no longer love me as a pastor or as a friend, but would you be trying to love me as an enemy?”

I think policymakers prefer the second for making most decisions, and it's for some reason other than just that that number is bigger. If I were an economist answering this question, I could compare the potential number of deaths, valued at the amount that the people value their own lives (on average, about $8,000,000), to the potential financial losses in jobs and markets.

I'm hoping that someone else can chime in with a note of encouragement, and truly, I've grown a lot in connecting with others. But the hard truth (to the extent that a stranger reading a paragraph about your life can say anything true) is that you will need to have people you can trust if you're going to make it through. Even if it's just one. Maybe that means suffering through intake appointments with therapists you hate until you find one you like.

The second (from *The Great Divorce*) is the story of the man with the pet on his shoulder. An angel asks him for permission to kill it, and he doesn't want to, because it's so important to him. But when he finally relents, the angel strangles this gross-looking animal on his shoulder. The animal dies, and is then transformed—now alive—into a beautiful winged creature.

My sense, from what little I’ve seen of God thus far, is that maybe these are less different than I think. God is love, unchanging, infinite, forever. But God also does specific and bold things in history. God makes plans. God died and rose again victorious, and this universe isn’t the same as it was before that happened.

Good news: you can break a cycle by intervening at any point in it. For me, mindfulness skills have been most helpful for this. When I learned to notice things getting bad before they got disastrous, I could intervene then and use emotion regulation skills to stop it from getting worse. With the little bit of resilience I gained from this, I had more capacity to build friendships. 

My psych made me make a commitment not to consider suicide as a potential solution until after I completed the DBT training. If you want to keep working on improving, DBT is incredible. But if you want to give up and can’t be dissuaded from it, that may be the realm of other professional help, like psychopharmacology or psychodynamic psychotherapy.

Whatever you do, don’t push it away. You’re yearning for something important, even if you don’t know what it is yet. Maybe it’s something tangible. Maybe it’s relational or psychological. Maybe it’s spiritual. I’ve always taken it to be spiritual, since nothing I’ve ever seen is big enough to fill it."

dbtselfhelp,f9l66v8,t3_e5hdzg,1575415388.0,"You'll have to decide if this is right for you, but the skill I would turn to (after radical acceptance and TIP if necessary) is validation. I had a (much shorter and less intense) relationship with someone who told me I could trust him and tell him things I was ashamed of. He left a week later. I wasn't in as much distress as you are in now, but I see how I could be if the relationship were deeper, longer, and more important to me.

Validation was difficult and helpful for me. I validated myself for feeling betrayed. Without denying that my feeling was justified, I also began to validate him. I think he felt surprised and overwhelmed by the intensity of the things I was going through, both destructive and constructive. Maybe he was doing the best he could, and thought he could handle it, but it turned out to be more than he could imagine."
AdultDepression,f9kz5pf,t1_f9jq66q,1575410864.0,"Something that's been really helpful for me is accepting moving slowly. Maybe it takes me 5 years to graduate college instead of 4 like I'd hoped, but at least I graduate college. I tend to imagine dying around 40, but if I don't, I'll have 20+ more years to do the things I was hoping to get done in my life.

Also, dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). I have a lot of moments of ""I'm distressed and I don't know why"" or ""I know why I'm distressed but I have no idea what to do about it."" DBT provides a super practical set of tools to deal with these things."

You’re welcome to date low-income folks, but if you do it because they’re the only ones you think will take you, you’re not giving you or them enough credit. There are poor people who have super high standards. There are wealthy people who are into exactly what you have to offer, even if you’ve never met any. Relationships are about love and partnership, not a quantitative comparison of what each person has to offer."

Hong Kong isn’t just about Hong Kong. It’s the wealthiest group of people fighting Chinese colonialism, and therefore the loudest. It’s about Uyghurs and Tibetans and so many others, and that’s why I’m thankful they’re getting the news coverage they deserve, even if others are not."
