Not an expert in that stuff though, [this](https://amp.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/8xfl5w/ba_not_sure_it_this_is_the_right_place_for_this/) thread might help.

amiugly,f6yp4d1,t3_dtti4l,1573290068.0,"Yes, you do have a long face. Your nose is also too wide. The only improvement you could make right now is getting a new haircut, probably something longer. Not sure about that stuff though, so you should check out r/malehairadvice. 

Fashion and getting contacts would also be relatively cheap and easy to do

If you really wanted to improve your looks significantly, the easiest and cheapest thing to do would to change something about your eyebrows. I can make some morphs if you'd like. There are many ways to do this, microblading, eye brow pencils, eyebrow hair transplant. Eyebrows are really important, they frame the face


The second thing I'd recommend would be a rhinoplasty, which would make your nose less wide. This is your worst quality by far. It destroys your facial harmony

You're about a 5.5, slightly better looking than an average white dude. Top 40% of males

Facial harmony is decent, meaning your facial features compliment each other well. Nothing stands out too negatively, but nothing stands out positively too. You have a thick neck and pretty good frame, which is a plus. 

If it weren't for the facial harmony and what I can see of your body, you'd be about a 5.

You can try to bulk up more, grow facial hair, and get a newer haircut if you wanna improve. Don't really know about those topics though, you should visit r/malehairadvice and fitness subs. Your haircut rn isn't bad tho, you could stick with it if you want to"
