I‚Äôve been working on this for both schools for over a year now.

The most recent one has only 600 students. (way less than the community college I‚Äôm currently at) 

They give me a week. I give them almost month before I start bugging them again. 

I‚Äôve heard of financial aid being a nightmare anywhere you go, but this is strictly transfer advisors.

Example:

Before the application it was- What classes do I need to take at community college that will transfer after the 60 credits. I wasn‚Äôt getting anywhere with email and phone calls so I set up a meeting to talk about it in person. I would drive there to sit down with her. And she would start by, So what would you like to talk about today? I would go over the same question and she would act like it was the first time we spoke. It took me months to figure that out. The actual application has been in for months prior to the pandemic and she originally told me it would be a week before I would get something in the mail. 

So I‚Äôm just wondering if this happens and I just have to suck it up or if public schools are any better as far as being organized etc."

It has kicked my ass. Lots of tears for sure. lol 
But I am now three weeks from finishing, so far with an A. The final project is going to kill me but I will be so freaking happy and (hopefully) proud when it is over.

(Is is not anywhere near where it was when I started it!) But for example, I used to have to drink the most caffeinated coffee all day in order to focus on work or really anything. Now I stick to tea because coffee makes me way too stimulated. So it feels nice to wake up and feel awake instead of grouchy until coffee :) haha

I stopped Lexapro because it made me gain weight and low libido but also it made me sooooo tired. Did not matter what time I took it. I believe I took it at night and I could have taken a nap everyday. 
I went off Lexapro for about a year and still had those side effects. (I wasn‚Äôt gaining weight at that point but I couldn‚Äôt loose it no matter what I did!) I still had low libido and was still sooooo tired. My depression got worse over the year and I decided to try Wellbutrin before the holidays. I am also beginning to see a therapist who does EDMR therapy. (For extra information, if you do experience anxiety or depression from trauma I‚Äôve heard great things about this type of therapy!) 

So my plan is to stay on Wellbutrin until I need it OR if something changes.

And last side effect I forgot about (sorry this is so damn long) is that I can no longer drink. Which I didn‚Äôt much before anyway so it does not bother me. If I have one drink, about five hours later I will get an excruciating migraine with nausea. This is a rarer side effect as I‚Äôve talked with tons of people who drink on it and are fine.

I will say while I am an anxious person I took Wellbutrin for depression. So what you are feeling now, wanting to just lay around and watch Netflix is exactly how I felt before taking and then after. By day 7 I was instructed to take 150 2x a day. I noticed at this point I was actually sleeping really well for the first time in a long time and feeling rested. It also made less hungry and my blood sugar wasn‚Äôt all over the place anymore. (I gained 15 lbs on Lexapro) and honestly I think I‚Äôve lost it all from the two months of Wellbutrin. I used to have to keep food with me all the time in case my blood sugar dropped, but now I go a normal amount of time without eating and feel a normal amount of hungry. (So that‚Äôs interesting) these two random side effects were enough for me to stick through the 6 weeks. I still felt depressed as hell and unmotivated until then.

Then one day I woke up and I was excited to go to work, excited to go to the gym, excited for what my week had in store for me. And when I wake up, I‚Äôm awake for the day. I used to do everything to stay in bed. If I had a day off I would never get out. I also take mine as soon as I get up in the morning. I‚Äôve asked me doctor to keep me on the 150 2x a day instead of the 300 mg tablet so if I ever feel like something is off I can slowly ween myself off without having to get to a doctor. Not sure if my rambling has helped but know that I struggled (Lexapro had me feeling better within a couple days) 
Oh! And last but not least, my sex drive is back. I haven‚Äôt had the desire to want to have sex in like 3 years. And I feel normal again! This for me was well worth it (as I am married) and didn‚Äôt change until the six weeks either."

antidepressants,fcylxfs,t1_fcyjyyk,1578082443.0,"I‚Äôm really not sure. I think it depends on the person. For example I‚Äôve heard that SSRI‚Äôs can cause your body to stop making serotonin all together, making your body rely on SSRI‚Äôs. I‚Äôve also heard this can happen even without SSRI‚Äôs under extreme stress.

I started using anti-depressants by age 12 on and off my whole life. I‚Äôve read something about taking anti-depressants before the brain is fully developed can cause the need to always be on them too. 

I think it depends why your body is having this problem. Are you depressed from past experiences/trauma? Is it your current environment cause stress? Is your brain not making enough of what it needs? Maybe both? Is it in your DNA? It‚Äôs hard to say. All I know is after being off of them, I will continue to try to use them ALONG with a therapist. I do think it is possible for someone to use anti-depressants along with a therapist to pinpoint why your having problems in the first place. CBT therapy or EDMR therapy can help those with trauma, OCD, and anxiety. Then, they can taper off. It truly depends on the persons circumstances.

From my research I‚Äôve hardly read much on low energy from Wellbutrin. I think because it is a stimulant it can cause anxiety and promote energy. I used to sleep 10 hours and feel exhausted. Now I sleep 7-8 and feel amazing. It all depends. Also, it has been used for ADHD. So maybe that is why it is calming you down? SSRI definitely made me tired and groggy. Have not experienced this with Wellbutrin yet. Also there are two different types of Wellbutrin, that may have different affects.

Hope this helps! My research is based off of experience, internet research, and what my developmental psychology class has taught me as well as past therapist and doctors."

My mood is overall more positive.  And honestly the best part for me aside from energy is sex drive. SSRI‚Äôs killed my sex drive, even after I stopped taking it. The Wellbutrin has made me feel normal again so I am so happy about that. I overall get more enjoyment out of activities that used to make me excited. I‚Äôve been on it 6 weeks or so.

Full Breakdown:
I am currently finishing up my associates at a community college with 30 grand in debt. (I had some prior schooling before going back) 

Private school =$35,000 more in debt 

Then one year at masters level for around $5-7 grand.

Totaling around 70 grand in loans

OR 

Public school

Sociology degree = $20 grand more in student debt

Plus 2-3 years in masters with anywhere from 10-16 grand in debt.

Totaling Between 60-$70 in loans

I am 27 and this is a career switch. I‚Äôd like to end up in therapy or counseling. Thankfully my husband works for the postal service and makes around 60 without student loans. After ten years it will be closer to 80. (Keeping this in mind)

Any and all opinions are appreciated. I am pretty alone in this and have exhausted myself trying to talk to school advisors about the right option.

Anyway, from all my Ted talks, self help books, and google searching I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that we many times become depressed because we feel disconnected from other people, alone. But once you add a support system with people that are interested in the same things or goals then that begins to change. Depression and anxiety is on the rise due to things like social media where we are so ‚Äúconnected‚Äù but in reality we feel much more alone. 

For example, one study brought a group of depressed people together a few times a week. Instead of it being a group that talked about their depression, they were told to pick a activity that they could all do together. They chose gardening. Over the next month or so this group of people got to know each other and connect while completing the common goal of a successful garden. What they found is nearly everyone no longer felt depressed. It was like giving people a purpose and friends changed everything.

depression,f9spmig,t3_e6oxt4,1575597504.0,"I feel you on this. I am also a 27 year old (married) female. I find it so hard to connect with anyone. I think the friends I had were sick of me being so negative. And I can understand, I can‚Äôt handle being around my myself.

But I started anti-depressants again this week. And starting therapy. Starting to feel a little bit like myself again. Just a smidge. I need to get my life back, I hope you find yours too. ‚ù§Ô∏è 

Also, another thing I‚Äôve noticed is honestly being 27 is hard. Friends are either getting married, having kids or focused on your career. I got married when I was 24 so that new excitement has come and gone. But it‚Äôs difficult to relate to people that are always on different levels of life? But there‚Äôs definitely this constant pressure of what are you doing with your life? Better figure it out soon! Your basically an adult, almost 30. Not sure if this hits home at all, but stuff I‚Äôve been thinking about too. 
Hope you feel better one day and get back to crafting."

I couldn‚Äôt sleep like at all the first few days, but I was super happy. By the third night I felt normal and slept. Since then I‚Äôve had good and bad days, but what I have noticed is that I‚Äôve been getting the best sleep I have in months- and I‚Äôm not exhausted during the day for no reason. I upped my dose to 300 after a week. I‚Äôm going to play it out for a month or so to decide if it‚Äôs the right drug for me. Good luck üëç

My old roommate had a rescue dog that did the same thing. Once we moved in together her dog got to be with our dog all day and she calmed down a lot. She also put her on Prozac. Maybe someone with another dog will help!

infj,f9gz7lv,t1_f9gxzop,1575306871.0,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about it and I guess I talk about my opinions based off of experiences that I‚Äôve had along with facts. I am a social work major so I get really amped up on talking about my papers regarding poverty and inequality. So I relate that to my experiences of living in South Florida or California and how it affects the town in NC where we live now. Some deep stuff, I suppose. 

Facts - these places have higher level of inequality rates.

My opinion - personal stories of how this affected me in some way. Many times comparing the clientele of my current job as a hairstylist. 

(A lot of this talk is in the back room of the salon I work at, talking to a friend during lunch and other people hearing)

I guess I‚Äôm pretty black and white based off of my own experiences but instead of someone telling me their opinion or saying something, I guess they just get pissed and talk crap about me being negative and opinionated. For example, going to by boss and telling her I‚Äôm being negative and bringing the whole team down. 

I‚Äôm just passionate is all."

I am a 27 year old that went back to school a year ago. I am finishing up my generals at a community college and will transfer to a university for social work in the fall.
My question is, what should I expect and how do you survive? Currently I am full time (12 credits) and work two-three days a week for extra income. (Yup still have to take loans out to survive)
I‚Äôve gotten most of my bills down to the basic needs, but being married my income covers all food, gas, any other miscellaneous expenses (for 2!) 
Once I transfer I will be up to I believe 5 classes plus an internship. (No time to work!)
I have to be full time or I loose a huge scholarship to pay for a chunk of tuition. 
So, how did you guys do it? And what were the courses like? Lots of papers? Research assignments? All and any advice is appreciated. 
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è"
