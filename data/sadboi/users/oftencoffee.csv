I am very curious about how you convinced people that are willing to ""lived with the state of things"" into changing it all ? Did you worked on the poc on your personal time ? How did you manage the incoming work with the work required for changes? Were you hired for improving the codebase ?

I am currently in a project where no matter what I do no one in my team is listening to me except my manager. So basically I am all by myself trying to housekeep, improve codebase to both leave something nice behind and also improve my skill set. Obviously, sitting idle won't do me any good at any point. However I find myself nearing burnout due to internal politics within my team. I do love refactoring, improving things, design, task planning etc. however I simply hate politics. I have so many ideas on how we can improve this and that, automate this and that, however I am finding it hard to sell this ideas within the organization, and it tires me to the point of dropping it all and run away."

As I mentioned we are only two people for the particular project. So I am not looking for team leadership, I only want more authority on project 1.

Rest of the team works on the other project which is a massively collaborative one that is overseen by a lot of seniors. A lot of decisions are already made in that project so my colleagues are only writing the code, not doing any design, that's why I preferred to stay in project 1 where I can design. I want to become an architect in the long run.

What I have in mind is really having some sort of authority on architecture, what merges to the codebase and what does not. In terms of where the project goes I already outlined the steps needs to be taken and set my quarterly goals accordingly. I talked with other colleague and we created Jira items accordingly. However, he is not willing to come and join me on these, he is only taking from the feature requests coming from PO. So I am somewhat already solo-ing the entire project design, development, reliability and housekeeping. 

So essentially I would like to be able to have him submit smaller PRs without waiting the end of sprint, spare time for review discussion, write testable code and also the tests of them and finally document them if needed. My manager agrees on these but expects me to have people on board.
However as I mentioned unless my manager personally tells my coworkers none of them listens or collaborates. So that's why I look forward to an ""official"" declaration so that people will listen to me. I am not sure whether my manager is willing to make such a move, he is really trying it hard to keep it horizontal.

Honestly, the problem is not with the company itself but the team I am in. We are globally distributed team, and only with the local ones I have the problems I mentioned. Other colleagues are just incredible people, honestly I wouldn't mind relocating if that was possible.

So yes I would like to stay here, as it is a well known software company, it is stable, pay is good, descent working hours, cutting edge technology etc. I don't want to give up on the opportunity I came across because of bunch of weird people.

If this was 4 years ago I would be destroyed hearing this, hearing that I am not enough, that I didn't measure up etc. It is the talk that father would give me. Same sh... that I am never enough no matter how much I achieve, how hard I work, how much I destroyed myself along the way. 

However now I know the only measure matters is the one within me, whatever I am happy with. 

After that I get few other interviews however it seems like I am at that limbo place where you are not a junior anymore but not a mid level (meaning you still have learning to do, they would prefer someone who knows, since that's cheaper) so I didn't get any returns.

>it's pretty impressive you recognized it was bringing up childhood issues, took healthy steps to cope and even started therapy!

It all really thanks to my husband, without his patience I wouldn't come this far.

I often struggle balancing 1 and 3. I can act like I don't care but then when the bully is starving for attention I am stuck between defending myself (thus engaging in and giving them what they want) and not doing anything (but then this somewhat acknowledges the  abuse imo). Also depending on the abuser type I can just freeze and unable to utter a word. In this particular case, the colleague of mine is no different than a big scary stray dog that comes barking at you. It is sheer terror for me sometimes. I am really struggling to keep myself in the moment when I hear is voice, or I should say berating.

I often report incidents to my manager, and complain to friends who are extremely surprised that I, a go-getter type of personality, that is loud and clear and opinionated, never ashamed of talking out, simply cannot put a stop to this. This is actually how I realized I have a problem here. Also the nightmares, and angry episodes :P

My husband often says that I get enraged not angry and if I could just keep calm I would dress them down so badly, that they would never forget it, that I can strike a cord inside a person cold-bloodedly at times if I want to.

The thing my husband is missing, even if I am doing such a thing it is not intentional. So there is no ""if I want to"". Most probably it is a survival mood thing for me, going all abusive.

I am guessing that I picked it up from my covert n mom, that constantly watches everyone and criticizes. Not a single positive word would come out of her mouth, none. And she will always do it with a sweet voice as if she is making you a favor by helping you correct yourself according to her frame of reference never caring your feelings at any point.

Also there is other point of me being afraid of perceived as abuser. I don't want to harass anyone in order to survive, I would much rather disappear silently.

I guess I still need to do a lot of ""role playing"" in order to get the behavior hold onto me."

Actually my husband made several remarks over the years about my mother when I told him of our family life. He often tried to draw my attention to my mother's behavior while I was blaming dad for everything. 

Now that I realized what she is doing, I can now clearly see it every single day.

I recently got married, and due to this whole shelter in place thing it was only me, my husband, sister and several friends. Our families were to join over skype. My sister called them but neither of them were answering. Mom was talking to someone else at that exact time of my wedding. My sister then called dad several times, and when he finally picked up he warned mom to shut the phone down, that it was the time. We turned the camera on, and mom told me ""Oh my god! Is it now? I was going to do my hair and attend my daughters wedding right?, oh my god I didn't do my hair yet ahahah"". I just left them there and proceeded with the wedding. My sister streamed the wedding to them, they congratulated us immediately afterwards, told my husband ""welcome to the family"" and hanged up afterwards.

My in laws called half hour later to congratulate us to give us some time to handle official matters. My family didn't even call afterwards. In fact my mother was sending family group chat about eating out that day with father. Totally irrelevant weird stuff. Mind that day were sheltered in, they couldn't go outside, also dad suffers from auto immune disease he shouldn't be wandering around at all. Anyway, my husband received calls from his entire family, and I didn't even get a single call. I couldn't stand it and I called them. My mom was silently crying and dad was angry and distracted. When I asked them did they even let anyone in the family know about the wedding, dad said they were not able to overcome the shock so no they didn't let anyone in the family know that I got married that day. Mom immediately started to talk about what a strange feeling she was having all day, that she is unable to sit still that day, that she doesn't know what to do with herself (Yet she ""joked"" about her hair just before the ceremony).

Anyway, a week later I had another video call with them, mind that my husband was irritated by the initial behavior and didn't want to participate. I showed them around the house we live and stuff. And then mother suddenly brought my pictures of age 1 or so. Those were in an album that I created years ago for myself. It contained my favorite photos of myself and that album was in the drawer of my room. So apparently she went through my stuff (as she always does) and put my baby photos in frames and placed them in the living room. You would think I died and they are morning about me. And my mom was flashing my photos to me and talking about ""her baby girl"". It was just so f\*\*ing weird and somewhat disgusting. 

I am literally unable to sleep when it just pops up in my mind. I cannot tell you how much creepy this behavior. So I decided to limit my calls anyway, as I did in the past.

This is interesting to hear because I had to quit my MSc degree (quantum comp) due to financial downturn 3 years ago (east eu)(and some other issues). Basically I started with minimal funding and a promise for a bigger incoming funding which never did. So I am not sure whether there is a significant difference between being already in academia with existing funding, and getting into academia with expected funds in terms of risks.

That being said,

>Scaling an app to 2B users can't be done by just reading docs, for example.

I do agree, on paper this is true, however as far as I can see, getting a nice juicy project at a company also comes with strings attached, that is office politics. I have been subject of bullying and smear campaigns for a prolonged time at my current company due to the improvements I did with the project, simply because coworkers didn't wanted bar to be raised.

My mother always told me that I started to speak earlier than usual and I was acting as if I was older, that once I even asked a waitress for additional service for myself when I was 4 and everyone was shocked. So that they always took me as older and acted accordingly.

Sorry if I am getting this all wrong, but I sense that you kind of put yourself as the reason of all this.

This stuck so hard with me, it practically ruined my life. I always wondered why I was always so dependent on external validation. I mean I moved past many things but this is so deep inside.

Now I am somewhat free of seeking external validation, and check with myself if I feel okay about something I did or not, and just stay open for criticism not seek validation.

However I do have this rage against people who are so comfortable self promoting and talk about themselves comfortably. I find them ""shameless"" because that is really what I have been taught. The thing is, I have huge problem with coming out public with things I do. I feel ashamed showing people things I do, unless I am drunk. 

I feel extremely ashamed wearing a new dress, even buying a fancy dress for myself.

I feel ashamed being authentic, and cannot handle attention due to it. People are so used to me being withdrawn and plain, I get too much attention whenever I change a thing or two.

I try to get past this, I even attended one company event (thought it was an afterparty) a bit overdressed. Other department employees that I didn't know (who appeared in their daily cloths) literally came and checked if I was from the company, who I was looking for etc. I was so overwhelmed and angry. They were literally sending me side looks and whispering and laughing. It was only with my coworker's kindness I was able to stay that night.

We drank and danced a lot and no one, literally no one I know ""shamed"" me or ""laughed"" at me for my outfit. I still felt a bit ashamed due to earlier encounter with other employees but I told myself, you are also an employee, you are invited, no dress code was stated, you didn't do a mistake, you have equal rights to this party, you can also enjoy and assert yourself. 

Still, here is this huge weight on my chest whenever I have to talk about my interests, hobbies etc. because I feel like people take it as I am bragging, and I feel ashamed. I feel like I don't have equal rights you know, I feel like some people are given more rights, I sometimes feel like I am shrinking, like I am a child that feel uncomfortable hanging with adults.

emotionalneglect,flwdibf,t3_fdgyd4,1585546947.0,"Hello,

I would like to share my story here as well. I also grew up isolated and buried into books. I also loved all parts of science and learning about the ""outer world"". When I was around 10, I watched this movie ""Space Cowboys"" at movie theatre. Damn I was so impressed by the whole astronaut thing. I decided to become an astronaut and travel to farthest away. I felt peace and comfort in that dark silence of space in addition to knowing that no one could come after me.

From then on I started research around, bought some science magazines whenever I could. I remember once asking father for a book from child section on lives of Newton and other physicist. I remember him shouting at me in the store that I am not ""smart enough"" how on earth I was supposed to read that, was I crazy now ?. I remember being terribly hurt over that.

Anyway with my child mind I decided to become an engineer even though I didn't knew any adult with that profession and had limited resource to learn more about.  When I was getting ready for university exams (in my country there is an entrance exam) I kind of started to realize I am not really interested in a STEM degree.  I was more interested in political science. However my father didn't sign the permission papers (and yes we had to get signs from parents when choosing major in high school as well, we had science and liberal arts classes) and forced me into a science degree.

I always enjoyed learning about physics, the mysteries etc. however it was just an escape for me, a hobby, something refreshing given my isolated childhood. It was my inner child still learning about world around us.

Anyway, I studied mechanical engineering at university and was diagnosed with major depression by the end of freshman year. I was suicidal at that point and dragged myself into the psychs office all alone, against all the shouting and blaming by parents did, I decided to live and save my ass. I got treated medically and that was wonders. I no longer felt anger, no more and all that shit my parents were doing was just flying by me and I felt nothing really. I didn't react, and learnt that world just went by regardless of what I felt. This liberated me.

From then on I took various classes from political science, philosophy, become member in student clubs (model united nations etc) even though I was majoring mechanical engineering. 

At the end of my junior year I discovered that I had so much fun coding. So I decided to focus on that. A programmer job would give me enough flexibility and variety of jobs that I would want. 

Currently I am working as an engineer in software industry with MechE degree (I am also female), and I must say I have been subjected to so much hatred, jealousy, narc attacks and whatnot along my career of barely 3 years. I quit 2 jobs because I couldn't handle my emotions, and at my third job I literally now refuse to quit because someone else is unable to behave as a regular human being. I am not a f\*\*\* punchbag for new grad entitled kiddos. I have my more than fair share of s\*\*\* happened to me, and I am not interested in indulging into more.

I started therapy and it was immediately obvious to my therapist that what I was experiencing was due to CEN. I always felt different, disconnected and numb inside. In fact my favorite song is ""This must be the place"" from Talking heads. I love the part ""I feel numb, born with a weak heart, I guess I must be having fun"". However my main complaint was that I was getting harassed at work and couldn't take it anymore. 

When we talk more and more about my childhood it was apparent that my interest in science was only ""instrumental"". I was a child that is curious of the world outside of her room. I was curious of places that I could hide safely and father wouldn't follow me there. 

I even started a MSc in quantum physics. I quit after a year due to variety of reasons. However by the time I was already moved out of my parent's house and I realized all I ever wanted was to get out of that house not fly to the moon.

My passion is with society and social justice. I still don't know where to being, how to make the transition, obviously I already built a nice career for myself, it doesn't feel safe to let that go and start all over again.

Sigh. 

So here is my story. I wanted to share because until several months ago, I though I always wanted to become an astronaut. It turns out I didn't, it was how my emotions were manifesting themselves. I just didn't have the skill to see and parse them out from there."

Once I shake that mood, I know he is pathetic, and I let go. As I mentioned in my post, I usually maintain my composure, but there are some days it is just too much. 

>I was belittled, yelled at, laughed at and undermined for the better part of 2 years.

I am so sorry that you went through that. In my case this person is my equal, a coworker and we have a joint manager whom knows all about this not only from me but from other colleagues as well. Another colleague of mine also subject to this passive aggressive behavior and we often in solidarity with him. And whenever I open up to him about my frustrations he comes with his own stories. So I know I am not alone, and his behavior is reported. 

>his pathetic ass into HR

I already talked to HR, told them it is impossible to talk to this people, they are closed to communication, what else am I supposed to do ? Also told HR that manager is not doing anything solid, at least to my knowledge. I know he talks to people, but nothing more really. HR pinged my manager on my behalf and I guess double checked the issue here. From then on my manager made sure I understand that he is supporting me, that ""those people I mentioned blocking my work"", that I have nothing to worry about, I should continue as before. My manager told me that this person is behaving immaturely, I shouldn't take him seriously.

Also I should have mentioned, this person thinks he is the victim. We had a colleague who had higher rank in our team but did little work. This person declared himself the victim saying that why that that person get to paid almost double of him while getting no work done. Whatever happens in the office, he thinks it is about him. Just so weird way of thinking really. He complains about everything possible, always drags his feet about his work, produces major errors (he broke production several times). Yet none of us shamed him, nope. We just didn't care, that's his career really. He never helped anyone in need, but often complains and flames when he is in need. He is again the victim, ""no one is helping me"", or ""that's their job, not mine"" even though he is perfectly capable of checking the thing himself. 

>but you're going to have to see how little he is.

I am doing that by showing up with solid work every single day. I accept my fault, get along with majority of people, everyone is always happy with my service. So yes, he better be worried because thinking alone doesn't make one great, hard work does.

My exact thoughts. Especially last year I was able to identify my triggers. I literally move into state of horror and panic if a person shouts at me or keeps talking to me in a threatening way and whatever I say they won't stop. I end up leaving the room and then get accused of being dramatic. One can avoid friends but at workplace it is a form of terror to me.

After this I kind of lost it, started having nightmares, often including my parents, again based on feeling of horror and tension. Or I had disturbed sleep. Until I feel safe again somehow. 

So knowing that I can break this cycle of me freaking out and recovering again is essential. I was not able to achieve so many things I wanted in life because I was moving into survival mode and hiding away. I never knew about boundaries, and now I know the term I watch practice videos to understan it better and apply it as much as I can. So I hope to develop more skills as I learn more, but I don't want to confuse mysef either."

To explain what I am looking for from these readings I am going to give a weird example.

There is this TV show called ""my 600-lb life"". At first it was hard to watch. However after some time I started to find the recovery stories of these people very very inspiring. For one reason or another, they were at their limits and were recovering. Also being able to see limits of human health was sort of a relief. I was a sickly child, and as a result my parents found justification in controlling me and isolating me. So I was always very anxious about my health, and was actually living in unhealthy ways because of this fear (I was afraid to exercise thinking I will get injured, afraid to miss a meal thinking I will faint etc.). After watching this show I found lessons in it. So I am looking forward to find inspiration from these books, yet still not sure how healthy this is though.

Anyway, this is my perspective on the issue, and of course reality of reading such books might differ from my expectations."

However I am at a lost to understand this all. This whole doing it alone thing is such an integral part of me, it feels wrong (and unsafe) to question it.
So I do see the point therapist is making, but failing to ""sense"" it as if part of my brain is missing. I don't understand the alternatives to my behavior. When I look around all I see people who constantly complain and wait for someone else to take responsibility and never really take a look into their own behavior etc. So I am failing to see ""other, or healthy"" alternatives to my own behavior.

As long as I had good grades and ""was not shaming family"" no one really cared about me ""in a meaning way"". They knew that I existed, and was fed and had good grades and nice shoes but that was it really. No one cared if I was a healthy happy person. In fact I was often blamed for my unhappiness. I was like an ad my parents used to brag about themselves. How I was so smart and doing everything by myself without needing any help. Well, it turns out to be neglect not a talent.
