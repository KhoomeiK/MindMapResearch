lolesports,fpmsf1t,t3_ge78e2,1588740481.0,"Map geometry rarely plays a part, some junglers like reksai prefers blue or red side depending on which lane they are going to play for other than rare terrain and champion pathings. Some champions are S+ where as some are S, A,B ... Blue side as you know decides the first ban and pick in the lobby. This means couple of things; even if we all ban the most S+ op picks, in the rankings order blue will get the best S tier champion. But this means red will get the 2nd and 3rd S tiers. So drafting is all about trading good champs for better champs for your team. But this doesn’t involve player priorities. In FNC Vs G2 series FNC team didn’t play kalista or they didn’t like playing kalista (kalista was a redside ban because as blue you want it to be your first pick,why?  Because kalista is a tri-flex meaning she can be played on three different lanes, this makes enemy teams draft harder cause you don’t know where kalista will end up) and so they banned her on blue, this an example of how players and champion proficiency interacts with drafting."

Tell your players that you are a player as well, so if everyone has fun and you don't that means you need to talk about how you can have fun. DM'ing can be challenging if you are new to the game and your players as well. For me, I see my self as the producer of a funky,  dorky fantasy tv drama. Throwing curveballs, putting obstacles creating encounters that will make a player feel like they are the best. Allowing my table to spend a couple of hours each week together away from reality is all we need.  Now for tips, hydrate as DMs we kinda talk a lot sore throat can be bad and it is good for headaches dehydration sucks. If people smoke or drink alcohol ventilate the environment. Take regular breaks, on the breaks check-up with everyone,  while playing good ambient music might help you set the tone and relax your mind.(Skyrim 1 hour soundtrack is my new favorite)  People talked about responsibilities so I will not talk about that. Excessive amounts of caffeine can cause headaches so be careful of your caffeine intake those days. Lastly, try to enjoy your player's journey and their exploration of the world you give them."

leagueoflegends,fifnf3c,t1_fietc59,1582391486.0,"Not to defend LS but elise in pro LoL scene requires a coordinated team, those tower dives are not happening from thin air. You need to prep the lane, know where enemy jungler is, pressure mid and so many little things that I probably forget. So why elise is bad, because you can pick things like karthus, seju, gragas who all have unique things that make them better at mid to late game. But elise just falls so hard, elise needs gold to stay relevant where as gragas or seju can engage at their will, karthus will output damage even if he dies. Elise not so much, you don't offer reliable cc nor damage. Elise is just bad compared to other picks but teams like you said u/VaporaDark they do what feels comfortable to them. Is it the most optimal way yo play the game no but it is a comfortable environment to play. 

&#x200B;

My last point will be, it is sad to see the coaching staff and analysts where teams put so much money into cannot even tell their players don't build morello it is a waste of your gold or build the correct ornn items. They may seem small but why are teams that play on stage make the game harder? Correct itemization is part of the game and strategy as well as team comps."

For week 2, G2 is the S+ tier team, they showed they can play from behind and understand the meta better than any team, of course some ints and shenanigans happened but they won at the end. S tier teams are FN,OG,RG, they fumbled a lot but each team has the players and the experience to be the best S tier team. 

SCH04 is F tier, worst team in the LEC compared to last year as well. Unfortunately F0rgiven cannot keep up even with the weak bottenlaners, banning aphelios every game because he cannot play and play against is a big liability for his team. Other teams put it in between as you wish. If you will continue to do this series, 

I would recommend you to add some facts, statistical facts and opinions from other analysts. Then it would be easier to follow and more reliable content. 

Lastly for later weeks if you continue make a tier list, start with worst team and work up to the best one. Because you can then talk about the why team x sucks more and compare it to the higher up teams. It helps narrative and fluidity of the content. These are basically reflection reports so why not try to make it more structured. 

Keep up the good work.

Start from campaign 2, if you want to catch up, look for the arcs and start watching by arc by arc. Once you catch up, you can watch the episodes you missed to get a context or just to enjoy.

Players are amazing actors, at first you will have your favorite, but I promise the more you watch and get into it, each one of them will be your favorite.

Matt is an amazing actor and a world builder. Combining these he is an outstanding DM. (He inspired me to becone a DM). 

Talented actors, plus an amazing world equals a great narrative. 

Watch Sam’s adds. I promise, you will wonder what he will do next. 

And most importantly find your own pace, amount of content that CR created over the years is massive. Whatever you start from C1 orC2 find your own pace. Don’t rush it. This community is majorly spoiler free so you can easily look for discussion depending on your pace. 

Don’t forget to love yourself and others. Welcome to this amazing journey.

leagueoflegends,ffbuxsy,t1_ffbg0ue,1579783619.0,"I realy cannot agree with this argument. First they are not playing solo queue, your first argument can make sense if the enemy team was not on comms and presumably worse than your team. But this is a tournament game, and those games are black and white, assuming both teams have equal level of talent.  Second, what is this with everyone with the higher mmr means better at game knowladge attitude. LS makes a living out of analyzing the worlds second best region, the guy talks with pro players all over the world and you are arguing that a washed up non-successful 1 split LCS player’s game knowladge is better. Did you watched any lck games while ls is analyzing or his analysis of the world games and lec finals? 

Third, do you know what is called a power spike? If you don’t let me introduce the concept to you.  Power spike at LoL is when a champion hits the items and levels for their kit to work at full power at a given time. So a lvl 9 akali with gunblade is a spike. Lvl 2 lucian with no items is a spike, an ashe without an item is not a spike. That champion is worthless at that point need at least 3 items, and ornn lvl 13 to be usefull. So even if you bleed out and wait for the spike for ashe and multiple other champs in the game, you have a higher chance of winning the game. Because your champions kit is now doing what it is intended to do.  

If a “higher elo player” cannot understand the the game properly, doesn’t respect their teammates opinion and them as individuals. That team is doomed. This isn’t a problem or drama about whose approach to the game is better, this is about certain individuals on that team treated LS as a joke, and made fun of him because of his opinions."
