MusicProducerSpot,fnzsnue,t3_g4l0uo,1587400061.0,"Are you looking for a desktop or laptop? 

I would suggest an AMD Ryzen chip. Their single core performance is getting very close to Intel's and the new mobile chips go up to 8 cores and are dirt cheap. In most cases out performing Intel's leaked tests of their new chips to come. 
Ryzen chips are now using less power than ever so heat output is very low.

I switched to Live to hopefully use all of my 1700X and besides some crashes which I believe to be the windows update issues, there is no stutter. Windows just sucks all around. If you are looking to go MacOS and don't want the lack of performance, high cost, and security issues of Intel, the kernel leak includes support for Ryzen CPUs! They already work for hackintosh. I could talk all day on this stuff."

MusicProducerSpot,fguwany,t3_eqos35,1581130856.0,"First of my advice: Stay away from loops and samples that you did not create. Down the line someone will come looking for royalties, especially from those who claim that their edits are their property and you are the one infringing. Save yourself the depression and start everything from scratch. You don't want to end up like me. If you buy into sample engines like Kontakt, that is a safe route I believe. If you can't help yourself just remember to read the fine print(terms and conditions, copyright) and check your metadata. Worst case you end up using what everyone else does and there goes genuine originality. Stand out. Don't blend.

2. The best investment I would recommend is either a Tascam or Zoom PCM portable recorder. They can be used in and out of studio and some are refreshed with audio interfaces. My Zoom H6 is my go to. It is a modular design unlike my Tascam DR-40. The mic head can be swapped out with other mic modules or two more line inputs totalling 6 inputs, 4 of which support phantom power with 4AA batteries. SD card storage, screen, and easy to learn interface. All inputs work when in Audio Interface Mode in your DAW.

3. Don't settle with a single DAW. I came from FL Studio to Ableton and not all of the plugins I have used are compatible with the other. I have invested a lot into both softwares and FL plugins like Harmor don't work in Live even though I bought it as standalone. My work edited and created in FL sounds much better when assembled in Live. Just for example. Logic Pro may be all around great and the perfect sound in the end, but just keep your mind open. :)"

Some sound drivers like the ASIO Maschine MK3 momentarily froze like flickers, and then the program closes. The audio settings are really sensitive and either way up or down on the latency and buffer, things just got worst.
I started out on LMMS and it has felt like I have to tinker in FL to make things ""perfect"" until the next windows update knocks everything off balance. I heard that FL spends most of the CPU on the buffer and latency settings rather than actual performance. 

Kontakt instruments are a pain for me to route and the sound is fine up until I have three instruments loaded."

schizophrenia,f5vjcsy,t3_dp6ov2,1572490757.0,"Now that I've read the whole post I have a few things to say.

Before I was on disability I was on food stamps after having a few jobs. I think that you need to put yourself into the working class system, pay taxes to get your food/disability allowance for each month. You have to work for your disability pay plus show many convincing signs that your head is broken. I don't know about you, but my old food stamps allowance per month was $211. $21 more than you say, but I fed myself nicely each night. I too have several allergies. No fresh fruits, veggies, or soy and everything has to be over processed or I loose my ability to swallow and later breath. I didn't live off of roman noodles. You don't need steak to survive. Try getting a job to keep busy. Not everyone can afford internet and rely on it to ""keep busy/watch youtube videos"". The government support isn't the end all be all golden ticket to happiness and success. There are many downsides to it. Keeping a job with it is hard because you can only make so much and what you do make they subtract the amount, if not more; out of your disability for the next month. Just like they did when disability pay went up $20 and they took $20 out of food stamps. The system keeps you low. I'm actually incapacitated so I could have a better chance to get onto disability. The rights lost are a whole other story. Schiz is not my only problem and schiz alone with convincing evidence of it, did not get me onto disability. Living off of taxes from hard working people sucks. I want to be like them and I push to be and it is hard to escape this with all of my crap and lack of decent income. I don't think that I have it worst than others, but it still sucks and it is not all that great as people make it out to be. If the majority doesn't, then I must know some weird people around here.

You can't always rely on everyone, or anyone, to take care of you. They won't just pass out a few hundred to anybody. I wouldn't give away any of mine to someone who complains about a situation that they still have the ability to make it out broken or not. Not even myself and it is an insult to me to be given freebies and I want out, but I am in fear of having nothing to fall back onto if things go to shit."
