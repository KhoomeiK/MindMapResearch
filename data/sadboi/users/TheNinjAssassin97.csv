That's me, a NEET who lives inside my own head; always thinking. Was great at school; love writing and language arts, history, calculus, physics, etc, etc. Many hobbies too. It's been almost four years since I got out of school; graduated at 19 with an adult high school diploma. Basically means if you're of age you can graduate with less credits. I was an honor student, however I hardly went to school let alone study. I feel like I squandered my past due to depression. Now I feel stagnant in my present despite constant thought and worry over the future."

depression,fb90tzj,t3_ec1rel,1576626509.0,"""All the liabilities in this world are due to the inadequacies of the person involved.‚Äù -Kaneki Ken, Tokyo Ghoul.

 I personally relate a lot to this statement, because at least to me, it's true. I'm a low functioning depressed, anxious, possibly bipolar and borderline twenty-two year old man. My past, present, and future are all determined by my decisions, or lack there of, because even not choosing to take action is a choice all the same. Not looking for a job, not getting out of bad today, not eating or over eating, not reaching out to friends, not trying in school, never studying, not going to school or work because going makes you feel like you're dying but not going can sometimes feel worse, etc.

 In my opinion depression is the most important, but wrongfully misunderstood and ignored, worldwide problem. It's the disease, sickness, darkness that makes you incapable of doing anything, but that exact incapability makes it worse. It's the slow death of not knowing, or being too afraid of living. Seeing as even high fictional people with depression ""exsist"", but doing the same mundane tasks day in and day out with no experiences that makes you yourself happy or give you self worth. How can that be called living? It can't, because it's not."

My ex was my best friend, but she never treated me right. It was a mess, we both had no one so after every heart wrenching break up we'd eventually get back together but being more dead inside. At least until the last because I realized my self worth and knew I deserved better. That there is someone out there that will truly love me, not just stick around for awhile and get their fix. I also snooped your profile a little op, you're from Newfoundland? I'm in New Brunswick. Just bringing this up to hopefully help you realize that our big world can be quite small at times, especially with those who can relate."

depression,faln5ws,t1_falkycb,1576187164.0,"Same, I have crippling- low functioning- depression, general and social anxiety that are officially diagnosed. I have had trained specialists mention that I might have bipolar, and, or, borderline personality disorder. Which I have taken online tests for and pass them which leads me to believe I may in fact have one or both. As for my ex, she was never really officially diagnosed, never brought to therapy or allowed to because her mother is a despicable human being. No meds or anything. She definitely at least had depression and anxiety though. Only person I know who've had more attacks then me. I like to think she was a pathological liar, because she has lied to me on many accounts. However, she told me and believes she has schizophrenia and dissociation identity disorder. So yeah..."
depression,fal4e2q,t3_e9pt45,1576178203.0,"I'm in a similar spot. No job. On social assistance, but I at least live with my mom. When I was still in High School though my ex pulled that card a lot on me. Not questioning your situations legitamcy, but her's. She would always text me at school that it was the end and I was just left there unable to function the rest of the day. I would have acted, but it was a long distance relationship and her parents didn't really approve either. The whole thing was just really shitty for me, but I understand how being on the receiving end of that is like. Obviously I don't know all the details, but depending on what they were the partner should stay in ""most"" cases. Though only you and her know what those are."

I was hurting so much I couldn't keep it in anymore and that's when they were all like ""Oh, something's wrong here."" Barely got through high school. My dad on the other hand tries, but doesn't realize that some things hurt me more than help. Like he'll do something nice for me and if I don't look happy or thank him he puts in these little jabs."

ShinyPokemon,f9uiuds,t3_e06xqd,1575651654.0,"Is there any confirmation if the increased odds are species wide or not? Like if I want to hunt for a shiny gmax Grimmsnarl can I hunt 500 Impidimp which is much easier to encounter, especially Morgem in the Glimwood Tangle, or do I have to do Grimnsnarl. Which, Grimmsnarl, for best odds is a 40% rare den in the lake of outrage or 25% on overcast in said location, grass only. The den having technically better odds, but even den exploiting would take far too long in comparison even with grass encounters spawning around or under big overworld pokemon. Any confirmation and or advise would be appreciated."

Despite that, I was told I should go the next day, which I did. I was placed in a cold, empty, white room with my brother who makes me feel more comfortable until a counsellor of some kind that worked at the hospital came in and asked questions. She then left, and later came in with her boss, a psychiatrist or psychologist of some kind, who asked me more questions. My meds were then increased to the max that any doctor can allow without a special request from a psychiatrist. So my experience wasn't terrible or needlessly over the top like some of your's, but did little to help all the same."

I'd miss days in a row, months a school year, but I got honors. I never tried at anything, now I'm 22 and on social assistance because I'm too depressed and anxious to handle a regular job. Despite this I've been slowly, but surely, getting better. I may only ever had three jobs in my life, but soon I'll be trying for number four! If I can finally handle it, save for college or uni. You just got to keep fighting, that's really all any of us to do. It's up to us to make our lives better, ones worth living. Then we can finally smile when we're at the end and say ""I did it."""
