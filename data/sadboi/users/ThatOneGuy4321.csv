PoliticalCompassMemes,fr2l9g1,t1_fr0zlte,1589839273.0,">You’re trying to argue that democratic socialism is about privatization.

No I'm not. I'm arguing that consolidation of wealth is a natural effect of the free market. Wealth consolidation inherently hurts small business. As we progress through late capitalism, breaking up big businesses will only get you so far because they will recombine and out-compete smaller businesses at an accelerating rate due to the advancement of automation technology. Small business is inherently doomed in the long run by capitalism, but if you want to even prolong its existence the only way to do that is to prevent [capital over-accumulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_accumulation#Over-accumulation_and_crisis).

I'm seeing a lot of confusion about the meaning of socialism here. I don't blame you. It's a tricky idea to understand with many different sub-ideologies. But if there's anything you should know about socialism it is these things:

1.	Socialism itself is simply the belief that capitalism is not the final, most efficient, or most utilitarian mode of production, and that humanity will eventually be forced to transition out of capitalism and into a stateless, classless, moneyless society. Discovering that capitalism could not last forever and would be replaced was [Marx's contribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Das_Kapital).
2.	What role the state will play in that transition, if any, is debated widely among socialists. This is why there is an authoritarian left and a libertarian left. Personally, I do not believe that an honest reading of Marx justifies attempting to implement ""authoritarian socialism"" (which is an oxymoron) in the United States or any highly-developed country.
3.	Socialists believe that the ""authoritarianism"" of a state is dependent not on its ideology, but on the [material conditions of that country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_materialism). In other words, any direct attempt to make a state more or less powerful will be unsuccessful in the long run, as the power of the state is determined by a country's stage of development and material conditions. In a post-capitalist (read: post-scarcity) world, the state fades into irrelevance as it is replaced by direct democracy.

>There are so many elements, such as the elimination of social classes, which I’m violently opposed to.

The elimination of social classes is something that happens on its own once a post-scarcity economy is achieved. As in, social classes fundamentally would not be able to survive in a post-scarcity world.

>a utopian concept that has never occurred.

Because the means of production were never fully developed. But in the United States, the transition has [already begun](https://hbr.org/2015/06/the-great-decoupling), and it's up to the American people to decide how it turns out.

>I’m sure this isn’t intentional, but trying to tell someone that you know their beliefs better than they do is quite rude and annoying.

Welp, likewise, you're trying to tell a socialist that socialism is an inherently statist ideology when it isn't. Its end goal is literally the abolition of the state itself.

If anything, socialism is inherently less “statist” than capitalism, because capitalism itself requires the existence of a powerful state and over time consolidates political power among fewer and fewer capitalists. The end-game of the capitalist system, unless the socialist movement prevents it, is the merging of an oligopoly with government and the oppression of the American people.

In the end, either corporatists will control the government by flooding it with capital and installing lobbyist officials or the American people will control it through democratic accountability.

So far, the conflict between capitalists and workers has created an equilibrium, since capitalists require the labor of the workers and workers have the power to simply stop working as leverage. But as labor is gradually obsoleted by automation, either the American people collectively seize the means of production, or capitalists make workers irrelevant and strip them of their wealth entirely. [As Stephen Hawking pointed out in his final Reddit comment.](https://np.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3nyn5i/science_ama_series_stephen_hawking_ama_answers/cvsdmkv/) I *highly* recommend you watch a documentary called American Factory if you want to see this in action. 

>And so their solution is to eliminate private property by transferring the ownership of it into the hands of state controllers?

No. The democratic socialist solution is to prevent any company from gaining too much political or economic power until capitalism fully develops the means of production, while mitigating the wealth disparity by implementing systems like standard healthcare and a universal basic income, and incentivizing a transition to worker cooperatives.

The socialist movement is all about preventing the consolidation of wealth and power in a capitalist system. Exactly through laws like the one *you* just proposed, putting a hard cap on the size of a company.

>Your solution is to have the state own the means of production and provide everything for the society.

It definitely is not.

*“The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.”*

— Karl Marx

Democratic socialism isn't about establishing a command economy. If you want to know what Marx thought about strong central governments then you need only read [what he wrote about them.](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/ch05.htm) He was obsessed with the Paris Commune, a highly democratic and decentralized state that prevented large government bureaucracy by establishing a direct democracy with a tiered council system. He believed establishing a strong central state would invariably result in that state becoming the new bourgeoise, which would itself begin exploiting the working class, which is exactly what happened in the USSR and China.

>My solution is to stop companies from becoming too large and too powerful, so that more small businesses can thrive and more Americans can own actual capital.

That *is* the goal of the democratic socialist movement. Democratic socialism is not opposed to free market capitalism so long as it doesn't result in a runaway wealth disparity and the consolidation of wealth among too few hands. Achieving a stateless, classless, and moneyless society is impossible without first allowing capitalism to run its course.

>You and I care about the 99%.

Then we are on the same side. If you care about the 99% and the nightmare that unchecked capital accumulation could bring about, then I believe that it is in your best interest to at least understand socialist ideas because socialism was created specifically to address this problem. Nobody is saying you need to agree with them. But the first step to making an informed criticism of an ideology is to inform yourself."

PoliticalCompassMemes,fqryq01,t1_fqrul7b,1589594746.0,"Interesting. 

Anyways, about my comparison, the reason the NAP is useless is because whoever is at fault in that example is “who started it”. And figuring out “who started it” requires scrutinizing the escalation of force, in reverse, all the way back to the most insignificant of interactions. 

So, we start off with the final action, which was the landlord bulldozing the house. Was this aggression justified? Yes, because the homeowner “aggressed” first by failing to pay rent. But was the homeowner justified in refusing to pay rent? What if the landlord raised rent to $500,000 per month to blackmail the homeowner? Whether or not that’s aggression depends on who you ask. And even if it is aggression, what if the landlord claims he did it because the homeowner aggressed against him in some petty way? 

Every attempt at conflict resolution would result in an endless, unresolvable argument. Even in the current US legal system the problem is already pretty bad, but a legal system that relies entirely on “who started it” would mean even the simplest court cases would be impossible to resolve. Everyone has a justification for why they do what they do. 

Additionally, if failure to pay can be considered aggression, then failure to pay taxes can be as well. You might not be able to move to a country without taxes, but likewise, you cannot build your home anywhere in the US that doesn’t already have an owner.

If taxes are theft so is rent. And also, if aggression against flakey tenants is justified then so is violence against tax cheats. 

And whether or not the US even has any legitimacy as a state at all depends on whether or not you consider an invasion of the Americas by Europeans to be considered “aggression”. Which it definitely was. Which forces anybody who simultaneously believes in the NAP and the legitimacy of the US [into denial](https://imgur.com/a/66x2DdV).

My point being that the question of “who started it” is almost useless as a philosophical basis for law since nobody “started it”, this stuff can be traced back all the way to the beginning of human history and also makes it even harder to decide who is actually at fault since it results in a clusterfuck. Instead of helping come to a more and more accurate conclusion of who is wrong, working backwards results in a more and more nonsensical conclusion that flip-flops every step you take.

Aggressing against someone else *for no reason* is very rare. People nearly always have some sort of justification, because nobody wants to be the villain of their own story."
PoliticalCompassMemes,fqrrv1h,t1_fqrrarj,1589590572.0,"I pulled a sneaky on you. That same chain of logic could be used to justify aggression against someone who doesn’t pay their taxes.

So instead of the rightlib position being as simple as “taxes are theft”, whether or not taxes or theft, and whether or not jailing a tax cheat is aggression depends on whether or not the territory you live in actually belongs to you or to the local authority. 

You could perhaps point to how moving to a country that doesn’t have taxes is unrealistic, but then again, so is homesteading land that isn’t already owned by somebody.

As you can probably tell, I don’t like the NAP as a rule of governance because whoever is “the aggressor” switches back and forth depending on which actions you class as “aggression” and how far back up the timeline you go."

It will appear rather in the luminous robes of flaming patriotism; it will take some genuinely indigenous shape and color, and it will spread only because its leaders, who are not yet visible, will know how to locate the great springs of public opinion and desire and the streams of thought that flow from them and will know how to attract to their banners leaders who can command the support of the controlling minorities in American public life. The danger lies not so much in the would-be Fuhrers who may arise, but in the presence in our midst of certainly deeply running currents of hope and appetite and opinion. The war upon fascism must be begun there.”*
