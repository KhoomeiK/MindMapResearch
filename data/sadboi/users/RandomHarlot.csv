abuse,eyzgem7,t3_czm5ql,1567617142.0,You are valid and important. Your experience is real. People suck. Don't let them try to warp your reality. You know what really happened. Do what you need to to heal yourself.
selfharm,eyzfsxd,t3_czhq5g,1567616754.0,"Like someone else said. It isn't always healthy to associate with other self harmers. This subreddit can definitely be toxic for people.      
I totally feel you though. I'm not super hardcore. I've never cut deep into the fat or anything. Never been to the ER for it except for an accident where I lacerated my scalp with a metal water bottle. (TW but see post history for that). But yeah I often hit more than I cut. Part of me wants bigger scars and wounds though."
abuse,eywq45b,t3_cz1cqj,1567535309.0,He's even gotten physical with you. It's abusive.
ptsd,eyn7mu8,t1_eyn7gpj,1567235261.0,Thank you.
ptsd,eylio9r,t3_cxc8b2,1567185372.0,Pretty much. Even though my home has been a toxic environment in the past and can be triggering. But I'm also chronically ill and low energy so I need a lot of downtime. The public scares me and stresses me out though. I don't handle crowds or loud noises well. The latter more so. And interacting with people is hard a lot of the time which I definitely can't do stoned. I'm way more comfortable in small groups of friends in either my place or somewhere that I'm comfortable. I also just need to be able to lie down a lot.
ptsd,eyj904k,t1_eyj8uox,1567114390.0,Yeah for sure. And a lot more people could use it.
selfharm,eye9vh2,t3_cwi1gp,1567030808.0,For sure. Sometimes I just wollow in my depression and it feels content. Like I don't want to even not be depressed let alone actually try to be anything but. Sometimes SH takes too much energy which I don't always have. Chronic depression coupled with chronic illness means zero spoons sometimes.
selfharm,eydbzff,t1_eydbu3q,1567015702.0,"Or on my head again. And thank you.

ptsd,eyd5oyq,t3_cwksci,1567011649.0,"This is a great idea. Buddy system! I'm a full service sex worker and a lot of us have to do this with friends and even acquaintances or online buddies when we go out on our ""adventures"".       
We use panic words or phrases which might be appropriate here as well.      
My closest hooker (I'm allowed to use that word) friend lives on the other side of the country and sometimes I'm her person and I have her sisters number just in case. So that sort of thing might also be good."
ptsd,exw0inn,t1_exw0ed1,1566610140.0,With what? My husband? Lots of shit.
selfharm,exvnvp5,t3_cuibl6,1566603156.0,"Why is someone downvoting everyone who comments on my thread?      
Dick much?"
ptsd,exv406x,t1_exv3np7,1566592356.0,Hopefully that won't become a thing.
ptsd,exv3kk6,t1_exv32h4,1566592107.0,Yeah that sucks. I feel you. I had a therapist that I really liked but he moved away at the end of last year and I just haven't had it in me to find a new one. Talk about abandonment issues. Lol.
ptsd,exv2sek,t1_exuzz74,1566591703.0,"Well before you pour your heart out feel them out and make sure you're comfortable and that they seem like a good shrink. Ask them questions. ""How do you handle someone with sexual trauma and unsettling fantasies?"" See how they respond. If you don't like their answer find someone else.       
I definitely understand the perils of finding a good therapist. Especially as a full service sex worker I have to find someone who's not bias as fuck which can be difficult. People often suck. Even people who went to school to learn to help people. Actually especially them when it comes to medical doctors. But there are good ones and you can find one. You just have to try. You owe it to yourself though."
ptsd,exv11r3,t3_cuhuas,1566590907.0,"You're not alone. Things have mostly been better lately but when my husband had his psychotic break last year he became totally abusive. Making it my third abusive relationship. It's definitely hard during the times that he triggers me because of our past.       
Do your best to take care of yourself. Try to set boundaries if you can. Remember that you are important and deserve good things and not this bullshit. This is not something you earned."
selfharm,exv0i5f,t1_exuzlwb,1566590695.0,"That sucks and I kinda feel bad for it but it makes me feel less alone. Outside on my patio we have a little storage closet with a metal door that I tend to hit the back of my head on when I'm upset. I do it pretty hard but I've never gotten a concussion or even a lump. There's also a dent in my wall above my bed from the same thing which sucks because we live in an apartment.      
I'm glad you only got a lump and not a gushing laceration though. Super not ideal.      
Take care of yourself."
selfharm,exuzk75,t3_cuirfk,1566590349.0,I feel you. I don't cut super deep or scar very well so my scars aren't very extreme but I wish I had bigger ones. I used to cut deeper but ever since my health went to shit my pain tolerance isn't what it used to be so I just don't have it in me to go very deep. I try but I just can't. I love the scars I do have. They remind me of everything I've pulled myself through. It's super dumb but I feel like if I had bigger ones I would be more hardcore which would somehow make me cooler. ??? Ha. Stupid.
selfharm,exuyq8s,t1_exuxz8e,1566590048.0,Thank you. All the best wishes for you.
selfharm,exuxrom,t1_exuwiio,1566589690.0,Yeah. Been there. I should really find a therapist.
ptsd,exuxgi8,t1_exuwa8b,1566589568.0,They do though. It's not always easy to find a good therapist but it's absolutely worth it. Please give it another try. You deserve help and positive reinforcement.
ptsd,exuvqcg,t3_cui5el,1566588927.0,"Are you in therapy? That would definitely help.      
You are not alone. I also have sexual assault trauma and it's fucked me up. I've managed to reclaim my sexuality through sex work and being a slut/poly/having a good sexual relationship with my husband. Although obviously all that is definitely not for everyone. Or most people at that.       
Even then I'm not fixed. Just a bit better than in the past. I still have insecurities, trauma, fucked up violent fantasies, and whatever.       
You can get better. There's a learning curve but there's a ton of room for improvement. It will never go away entirely but it can definitely become manageable. Take care of yourself. Know that you are loved and important and deserve good things.       
It's also good that you're aware of these issues. That's a good start. You're getting there hun."
selfharm,exuqwzx,t3_ctxsmw,1566587256.0,She's a jerk. Totally gatekeeping as if she's a better self harmer than people who do it in other places. That's not how it works. You're kind for doing what you did.
