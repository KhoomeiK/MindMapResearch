For me, non-violent communication (a.k.a focusing on ""unmet needs"") have helped me a lot to figure out the causes of my emotions and to calm myself and my mind... because even though it may feel like it, these emotions don't come from nowhere.  There's a reason for them and many times it could be because there's some sort of need that isn't met (it could basically be the need for food and that you're hungry, which is why there is this term called ""hangry""), and in some cases it could be that the emotions come from a need that wasn't met when you were a child and that it lingers inside you to this day. 

It's not always easy to figure out what it is that one needs, but I try and ask myself from time to time ""what do I need right now?"" whenever I feel some sort of strong emotion that I get anxious about. I've come to realize lately that a lot of the general anxiety/stress (which in turn can lead to sadness/anger etc)  that I have comes from growing up with an alcoholic dad that was very distant, that I had to walk on eggshells to not upset my parents and never truly felt ""safe"" in my home. It sometimes makes me feel very sad and lonely, and to deal with that feeling I usually just tell myself: ""I'm here"". I guess it's kind of the adult me telling my inner child that: ""It's okay, you're not alone. I'm here with you. Tell me what you need."" and it helps most of the time. 

I don't know if this was of any help, but I really hope that you'll find some way that will give you that inner peace that you need. <3 Lots of hugs!"

They made you believe that they had power over your words and images, but they never had. Your art is YOUR story. Your art is YOU, not them. I know it sounds cheesy, but it's the truth.

My family always encouraged creativity of any kind (dad likes music and mom likes art) but I also got to hear a lot of mixed messages like ""art is an unstable career so don't do it"" and ""YOU'RE SO AMAZING, YOU AND YOUR SIBLING SHOULD MAKE A CHILDREN'S BOOK""...and I was expected to make b-day/holiday cards and etc (for free) for mom's relatives. My mom also used to compare my art skills with my siblings' and could for example tell me: ""You're really bad at drawing/linework, your sibling is better at that, but you're great at colors"" which made me feel bad and I began focusing a lot on getting ""better"" at drawing instead of drawing for fun...

It got worse for a while when I went to an art school a few years ago and got comments about my linework there as well, but now I don't care as much and have a more healthier relationship and attitude about my creative work. I know my limitations and understand that my art is a reflection of me, my personality, my priorities, my interests etc...and someone telling me to change something about it (without any good reason) is like someone telling me to stop wearing a type of clothes or whatever because THEY think my clothes are ugly."

Both my parents do this and I've asked them several times: ""What would you lose if it was true?"" (or gain if it was false?) when they deny or question any traumatic memory that I bring up to them...and they never give me a straight answer and have even told me that they would gain ""nothing"" yet continue to tell me that: ""Your memory of the situation seems very unlikely and not like something I would do"" or ""I don't remember that..."" etc. 

It's so frustrating because I don't bring up my trauma to them because I want to blame them, I just want to process it and get closure, but they just get very uncomfortable and angry everytime which makes it impossible. I try to process my trauma as good as I can in other ways, but I would have preferred if we could have gone through this together and that they would have acknowledged the abuse and the damage that was done to me and my siblings, so that we could build a more healthier family relationship. Because I know my parents had problematic childhoods themselves and that they were hurt by abuse and neglect as well, and I do care about them and want them to heal too, but they just don't seem to care about healing at all. They are stuck in a ""nothing can be done and nothing is my fault"" mentality and I've tried to help them get out of it since I was a kid, but I've just come to realize that I can't try to help people that doesn't want to be helped. I won't push them away in the future if they ever change and process their own trauma and toxic behaviours, but it feels pretty hopeless at the moment and I just need to focus on helping myself to heal.

I think it's one reason why I don't watch that much TV anymore because there were just so many shows that felt iffy in some way.

It's sometimes difficult to know what the creator's intention was when writing a story/characters/etc (unless they talk about it in some interview or something) but I'm pretty sure that for every person who wants to highlight something that they think is wrong or messed up, there's a fair share of: ""other movies have had characters/stories like this and have been successful and I guess it's relatable or something so let's go with that"" -attitudes as well (or similar)...and I think that someone who wears the ""that's the way things are""-glasses won't perhaps even notice the difference between the two and just think: ""wow relatable"".

Apart from the three roles golden child/lost child/scapegoat there are other roles as well, and I think there can be variations within the roles too.

I think that the roles can be a good guideline to find out ways to heal and connect with your siblings, but I think that focusing on talking to them about their thoughts and feelings about the family and childhood (how they saw their parents and their siblings, the relationship dynamics...) is probably the most helpful and easiest way to find out what they struggle with and where they need support. It can be difficult and especially if they have been repressing their emotions for many years (I've struggled with this and got help from my siblings to open up more), so it's good to take it slow and carefully.

I've gained some weight back (I'm pretty close to normal weight and am 52kg now) and it has been a very difficult process because even though I got some support from my GP (got an appointment to a therapist and nutritionist, I had to wait a month until I could see the latter though due to waiting lists...)

The body needs to repair a lot in the beginning of recovery so even though you eat way more than you've ever done before, it's for a good reason. 

I don't really know if I could recommend counting calories, because even though it made me feel a bit ""safer"" that I tracked what I ate (since I couldn't trust my hunger signals etc) I also got anxious about a lot of nutritional stuff that the app was tracking which sometimes made me relapse slightly when it came to fat intake etc...I've tried to be more intuitive when it comes to eating now (but still track a bit since I still don't trust myself enough) and I think that you just have to try and see what method works for you. When it comes to amount of meals, I usually aim for two bigger meals every day (lunch and dinner) and then atleast 2-3 ""snacks""/smaller meals spread out over the day and make sure to have nuts and other small and calorie-dense snacks at home for times when I struggle to eat. (Just not feeling hungry or too exhausted to cook etc). And I add a spoon of extra virgin olive oil to a lot of meals since it's a good healthy fat.

I have mostly struggled with feeling too full rather than extreme hunger so I'm sorry that I can't give you any advice there...I would recommend you to talk to a nutritionist (if possible) because they can help you find methods/meal plans etc that work for your needs.

I still don't feel like this is an  issue that's manifested due to outside factors, it just feels like I'm  performing symptoms to make everyone's life harder 

I struggle with this too. My mom used to say ""depression doesn't exist"" because she had never experienced it (lol), and also told me and my siblings to not go and see therapists because ""what if you get a diagnosis that will label you for life and ruin your chances for a career etc"". I've struggled with eating disorders, depression, anxiety too, and thought for the longest time that it was all my own fault and that I was weak and lazy.  Just a big mistake that couldn't deal with the things that other could.   


Mom did actually understand a few years ago that depression exists (and realized that there are others in the family that has had it) but she denies that she told us what she told us and nowadays she can send me or my siblings things like: ""this method will cure your depression/anxiety/OCD in ONE DAY!!!"" and other things that basically means: ""If you do this you'll finally get healthy, and if you don't you're stupid and obviously don't want to be 'cured'."" 

I tend to ignore it because it's mostly just annoying, but I think a lot about how different it would have been if my parent wouldn't have treated me (and my health) as a ""problem to be solved"" or something that one shouldn't talk about or show. : / (And like yeah, obviously I would prefer to not have anxiety about a lot of things but I know that there is no miracle cure, and that I'm working on learning how to deal with it and learn new healthy habits...and that it takes time.)

I won't go into details since it can be triggering, but I can say that it has not been healthy attitudes and discussions when it comes to food and exercise. 

So if you're able to, it could be a good idea to mention that you're uncomfortable with it and see what happens.

Having happiness being connected to your weight is an emotional rollercoaster (and a dangerous one), and I know it isn't easy, but remember that you're so much more than your body.

Also, this parent was the one who bought most of the clothes and stuff for me and my siblings (while my other parent wasn't that much for buying things for the family at all) so I think it could be that they were really frustrated about that as well... in any case, they should have discussed the problem in private and not bring us kids into it like that.

Because even though it is a stressful situation for a family to not have enough money, there are healthier and less stressful ways that a parent could handle and explain the situation to their kids. I mean, if they had said ""We don't have that much money at the moment, but we're going to do our best to fix it. Don't worry."" it would have been a totally different story.

We had already grieved the situation beforehand for many years basically.

I don't know if it's healthy or not, but regarding your situation I think it's a good idea to give yourself space to grief even if it doesn't come when you expect it. Grief really is different for everyone, and I've found myself grieving things a long time after something has happened, while it's happening, and before it even has happened. Sometimes it's short and intense and sometimes it's this slow constant process that can go on for months or years. 

I find it easier to deal with grief if I ask myself what it is I'm truly grieving.

I used to think and tell myself that ""the alcohol abuse wasn't THAT bad"" because my alcoholic parent weren't violent, but I remember stumbling upon a sentence recently which was something along the lines of: ""you can't love someone if you aren't there"" and it made me realize that my parent's absence was extremely damaging.

They were unavailable when it came to love and support, and no matter how much I tried to reach out to them and talk about their alcoholism it just went nowhere. I was often told ""that's just the way things are"" or ""it can't be helped"" and it just hurt so much.

It sucks, but it's not your fault."
CPTSD,f4njd25,t3_dl560m,1571690023.0,"I've had eating disorders (mostly restricting though) for many years and a lot of it has been triggered by anxiety and stress (emotional etc) and being unable to cope with them in a healthy way...most of the time I wasn't even aware that I did it because it just happened and I didn't realize that I hadn't eaten for a long time or I didn't notice that I was hungry, while other times I basically told myself mentally: ""you shouldn't eat"" or ""you don't deserve to eat"".

I've thought about it a lot lately and I guess it could be that I grew up with a parent who had issues with emotional/stress eating, but that also sometimes said stuff like: ""I get to eat this now because I did this difficult thing and I've earned it""...so yeah."
CPTSD,f4nfoka,t3_dl3xsz,1571688971.0,"I've thought about this recently because I have a sibling who has a similar issue (and I kind of have it but not as much?) and the main thing I can think about that may have affected us in our childhood is that one of our parents eats very fast and a lot (almost cartoonish in a way) and that it was very stressful to see them eat and occasionally you got worried that there wouldn't be enough food for everyone.

There were some other issues as well (alcoholic parent cooking drunk for example) so in my case I guess that it's probably caused by stress and not feeling safe during meal times. (I'm trying to eat more slowly and consciously nowadays and it has helped a lot...)"

CPTSD,f4akt7k,t3_dk22qx,1571496804.0,I've done this but I'm kind of  wondering if it's more because I grew up with people who were very undisciplined/impatient etc so I tried to compensate for their behavior or something?

EatingDisorders,f3xnix3,t3_dipadq,1571241061.0,"I've struggled with disordered eating during times of stress (often due to workholicism/working for longer periods of time without breaks) and it's really important to realize that, even though you're stressed and anxious about something, it won't help to not eat. It may seem like a good short-term solution sometimes depending on the reason why you don't feel like eating (or feel that you have time to do so), but in the long run it will affect your health significantly and especially if you don't sleep enough at the same time. The body needs food and rest to maintain and repair it. 

It's not easy, but taking breaks and make sure to eat and rest will give you more energy to deal with stressors from work and life in general. If there are issues with cooking or finding time and energy to eat, try to find foods that are easy to eat or cook with little to no effort. 

But perhaps most importantly, it's good to think about *why* you don't want to eat when you're stressed. You need food and energy more than ever when you're stressed, so why are you denying your body the nutrition that it needs when it needs it the most? Even if you're doing it involuntarily it's still something that hurts your body, and it's the only body you have. And like I said, it's not easy, but hang in there ok? <3"
CPTSD,f3xk8yt,t1_f3ucwgo,1571239656.0,"Yeah, when I was younger I always blamed myself for every mistake I did or anything I ""failed"" at but now in retrospect I just realize that I didn't have the tools or knowledge for a lot of things that other people expected me to do.  It was really a lot of ""I know this, so why don't you?"" instead of ""Here, let me teach you how to do it. It's okay if you don't get it right the first time""... : / (And drunk cooking is just...man, I could probably write a horror story from what I've seen and experienced.)

I'm really grateful for this sub too because it has made me see and acknowledge the wounds that I have and it makes it a lot easier to heal. : ) And like, I'm still pretty shocked by your post because I really have never ever seen anyone talk about this, and reading it made me think about similar situations that I've been in...so again, thank you so much. <3"
CPTSD,f3tsor6,t3_dhvvvc,1571145093.0,"That lobster story made me so angry. I've had similar issues with food/cooking in my family, and this is the first time I've ever heard of anyone else having a problem with getting ""gourmet/adult"" food instead of food that's appropriate for children so...yeah, I totally understand and relate. You have all right to be angry. 

Overseasoning food happened a lot in my family too (one reason being that my parent often cooked food drunk, because drinking wine was something that good cooks did according to them if I remember correctly) and I grew up with hearing ""if you didn't cook it, don't complain"" so I began cooking at an relatively early age because of it. It has taken a really long time for me to realize what healthy and good ""simple"" food is though, because I never really learned that much useful cooking from my parents (one parent also only cooked or bought fast food btw, so yeah very inconsistent quality when it came to food in general in my family)...

I've struggled with eating disorders and negative self-talk too (I'm thankfully in ED treatment now after finally realizing that I have a problem) and I really hope that both of us will get a better relationship to food that's our OWN and that's not tainted by others opinions. :) I wish you the best and thank you so much for sharing your story <3 It made me feel less alone."
AdultChildren,f3tp9t7,t3_dhwxun,1571142397.0,"If you haven't read it already, I would really recommend the book ""Scattered Minds"" by Gabor MatÃ©.  It explained so much about the struggles that I've had since I was a kid (that could count as ADD/ADHD, but idk I've never been officially diagnosed) and it's a lot about how lack of stability in childhood (growing up with stressed/emotionally immature parents etc) affect our mental and physical health.

It helped me understand my parents' behaviours better too and what I lacked in my childhood from them that I need to try and take care of now through self-parenting. It also touches a bit on addiction and I realized that, even though I never began drinking alcohol or do any other drugs, I've struggled with addiction behaviours (workaholicism and eating disorders) due to my dysfunctional childhood. So I really recommend checking it out! :)"
AdultChildren,f3lun57,t3_dgs3ms,1570979770.0,"I don't know if anyone else can relate but the sober periods (because idk I don't really know if they truly ever are or will be sober...) that my parent has had often started due to them getting in an accident or something that they couldn't hide from people outside the family. Like wounding themselves or being thrown out from someplace for being too drunk (or ending up in jail)...just things that they can't come up with a lie for or cover up in some way like they usually do. 

I've always been a bit upset about it because it's like they've been completely fine with being an alcoholic around the family but as soon as someone else notices then it's a *problem* and they have to do something about it. And extra frustrating since you have tried to talk with them about it many times before to no use and then suddenly they're going to turn a new page just like that. It usually just results in a short period of sobriety and promises and changes that lasts for a while and then it more or less goes back to square one, but it's annoying anyhow.  

And like, if they decided to change and truly became sober I would be glad, but it's just that this scenario has happened so many times."
CPTSD,f3lidpj,t1_f3l0jxo,1570976273.0,"I agree, and I think that it's a lot more about ""letting go"" than to like accept and excuse another persons abuse/toxic behavior. 

Because really if someone says they're sorry and they keep doing harm to others, then it's not an apology. If you forgive them and they continue hurting you, then they're not taking the hand that you're reaching out to give them a chance to become better...and you don't have to put up with people like that."

I think work can be pretty relaxing sometimes (like you said, it's nice to focus on something and preferably something interesting) but I just go overboard and work for too long without taking breaks etc... so I just really need to learn how to pause and check how I'm doing."
CPTSD,f3fsts1,t1_f3f9a18,1570902075.0,"I totally understand and relate, and I'm so sorry that you're struggling now...and I guess I've kind of moved in a similar direction as you did this past year because I've too come to the realization that I don't really know who I am or what I want when I'm focusing on me. I've been so used to working or doing things for others and focusing on others' needs/problems before my own that I don't really know what I need, I think?

I just remembered something that I read in a book though that has helped me a bit, which was about seeing oneself as a context instead of as content (= labels/judgments/statements you make about yourself such as ""I'm (x) years old"", ""I'm unemployed"", ""I can't do this"") or as a process (= what you're feeling or what's happening now. ""I'm feeling sad"", ""I'm crying"", ""My stomach hurts"".). The context = ""I"", is a person who is a lot more than what they experience and the attributes and relationships that they have...and who is still there observing the world even when their content and processes change throughout their life. It's the person who has been there since you were born.

It was a lot about regaining one's identity as an observer (what you think and feel about things) instead of someone who identifies with what they do or labels that they've put on themselves or have gotten from others...I don't know if it's of any help or if it made any sense, but I just thought I'd share since I began thinking about it.

Thank you so much for sharing, and I really hope you'll be able to find a good balance in life and that you won't have to feel the pressure to live up to your earlier workaholic standards. It really sucks when you try to do something good for yourself and it backfires, so hang in there ok? <3 And I'll make sure to try and take it slow in my own road to healing. :)"
CPTSD,f3flvhk,t1_f3f8fls,1570899040.0,"Yeah I relate a lot with that....I used to take extra evening classes in school just to be somewhere else and luckily I had some friends that did the same, so it was really a sort of safe zone in a way. And it was also a good ""excuse"" because if someone at home complained that ""I wasn't doing anything"" or that I was ""lazy"" I could always respond with: ""Uh, you do know that I go to (x) and (y) class?"".

And that's a good idea, I'm so used to just keep pushing myself even when I'm feeling fatigued or uncomfortable in some way so I really need to learn to pause and check how I'm doing. (Also I really wish I could stop overanalyzing others' reactions too ughhhhhh.)

CPTSD,f3baiaj,t3_dgflx7,1570805715.0,"> Congrats to all those self made millionaires half my age who got by on  pure determination and tenacity and hard work. While here I am, broke.  Is it because I'm lazy? No! It's because I had to use all the energy  that could have gone into working my way to success, just to survive.  Just to avoid killing myself. 

I recently talked to my sibling about this and it's still pretty mindblowing for me to think that many success stories where they go like: ""This person was only (insert age that people consider young and amazing) when they began their business..."" often don't mention (well it happens but not always) that they had financial support from their parents/relatives or just really good connections. I recently learned that it's really important as an adult to become interdependent rather than independent, and I think many who grew up in unsafe environments struggle with it. Because often there aren't many around you that you can truly trust (and you can't even trust yourself sometimes which sucks even more).

For the longest time I thought ""Well, I guess I must be lazy or not good enough at what I do because others seem to be able to do it on their own"" but like you said, if you're busy surviving and taking care of your wounds every day, it will drain you and you'll have less energy to spend.
