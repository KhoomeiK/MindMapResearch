IAmA,fpw3408,t1_fpv3kur,1588956422.0,What do you think causes the hostility (if you agree that it exists)?  And what can be done about it?
IAmA,fps7icz,t3_gf7muy,1588868769.0,"Doctor, thank you for doing this AMA!  My question is this: in my experience the word ""unproven"" is often conflated with ""disproven"" when discussing alternative medicine.  For example, I often hear a variant of: ""X alternative medicine hasn't been proven to work via a placebo-controlled, double-blind study,"" when what the speaker means (as determined by the rest of the conversation) is ""that hasn't been scientifically proven and, therefore I will definitively conclude that it does not and could not work.""

Science is important.  Proof is important.  But the level of what seems to me to be intellectual dishonesty (e.g., ""unproven = disproven"") and, often, outright hostility towards alternative medicine seems unwarranted.  What do you think causes that (if you agree that it exists)?  And what can be done about it?"

1) Print screenshots of any texts or other communication that show that the behavior was consensual.

2) Document everything.  

3) Go to your parents, not the school (at least not at first).  The school's primary interest is not to protect you.  

4) Go with your parents to a lawyer.  Yes, the situation is that serious.  A lawyer can provide two things: 1) An outline of your options.  You don't want to escalate the situation and perhaps s/he can suggest a middle ground to diffuse the conflict.  But, 2) If that doesn't work, the lawyer can provide some perspective to the girl about what may be in her future if she does not quit.  For example, a certified letter from a law office demanding that she stop her defamatory behavior and outlining the potential consequences if she does not may convince her, at the very least, to stop spreading lies."
