The last kingdoms main character is a made up person loosely based on a famous Northumbrian Nobel. However, the surroundings and history of Alfred the greats reign are much more accurate.

Both are fun shows, the last kingdom star off dark but introduces fun character whilst it goes along.

History wise, Viking’s was written by a screenwriter whereas The Last Kingdoms story was written by a rather famous historical novelist.

If you’re looking for history the last kingdom is much better, the first season betraying the great heathen army and the battle of Edington."

I’m my mind it’s wildly in accurate to what a hobbit might eat as hobbits are based off rural Englishmen.

Firstly, switch out the American bacon for fatty English bacon.

Then, make the sausages proper pork and apple sausages.

Add hash browns and black pudding and get rid of those atrocious looking baked beans for some proper Heinz ones.

Edit: looking back at the photo, bin whatever those yellow things are next to the toast.

Edit 2: and have a cuppa (preferably Yorkshire gold)."
