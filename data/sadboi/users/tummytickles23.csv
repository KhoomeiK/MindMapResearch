Assistance,fnslnnf,t3_g32hpc,1587224158.0,"Also, the VA has inpatient psychiatric treatment that he may quilify for for free.  If he can somehow trust to go there.  He could stay, get his medication, get stable.  As far as I know, he wouldnt be allowed to leave there without them knowing he is stable and has a place to stay."
Psychosis,fmkrffd,t3_fvuks1,1586165704.0,"ðŸ¤— Hello.  Similar has happened to me.  I now fit the criteria of schizoaffective as I have the mood swings of bipolar and symptoms of psychosis during periods both with and without the mood swings.  I handled this by explaining this to my psychistrist.  The label of the illness doesnt matter so much as what symptoms you are being treated for.  BP 1 w/ psychotic features and schizhoaffective are very similar.  In my experience my meds didnt even need to change.

Are you struggling with delusions about your medication?  I know that they offer some antipsychotic meds as shots that can be helpful to push through that as well."

bipolar,fktfvgk,t3_fklahl,1584517940.0,I have noticed the more anxious or stressed I am...I tend to have more life like dreams that feel real.  Like it kind of feels like my brain is too active even though I am unconscious.  Like an almost awake deep sleep if that makes sense.  Where my worries and stress materialize in a life like dream that feels too real because I am not fully in a deep sleep.
confidence,fkodl23,t1_fko0o5t,1584385081.0,"That is interesting. It could be that in a heightened state of arousal (freeze, fight, or flight) maybe automatic responses like blinking get caught off.  Is it possible that you are forgetting to blink?"

I find that the things I need in life to maintain a full spectrum of stability, health, and a hope at happiness are things that most people WANT.  For example; low stress job that pays a living wage, extra days off for mental health mgmt, regular therapy sessions."
schizophrenia,fkaaekp,t1_fhlv9md,1583998932.0,"Yes, thank you for the response.  My psych thinks it is actually schizoaffective.  I feel that too as I struggle with mood, and a constant level off some psychosis...I tend to always struggle with some level of paranoia.  I think I have progressed within the past year as I constantly misinterpret peoples words and behaviors as having malicious intent.

What I will say is that people with mental illness can fair waaaayyyy better in life when they have a support team on their side that understand their struggles.

schizophrenia,fka839r,t1_fka7p3v,1583996146.0,It can be very helpful if you work with the right therapist. It sounds like your struggling with a sense of self now along with some more serious mental health symptoms.  I see my therapist at least once a month to check in and make sure the meds are working and I am not losing grip with reality.  Diagnosis labels arent as important as getting the right treatment for your symptoms.

careerguidance,fk36crm,t3_fg8ym4,1583819337.0,"It depends.  Are you prone to depression?  If so, night shift can certainly trigger that. It can take you out of rythym of daily sunrise sunset life that most people live. Also, making it more difficult to keep up a healthy active social life.  There is a reason why it pays more. Will the pay be worth it to you?"
SuicideWatch,fjzm615,t3_ffnwum,1583723062.0,"Ive known people whose head got messed up by
 drugs.  Overuse of drugs like these can cause a chemical imbalance (mental illness).  They can cause an increase of depression, anxiety and cause paranoia and delusions.   I would reccomend trying to see a Dr. for medication.  Good news is is what you are feeling may only be temporary after fixing the imbalance and rewiring neuropathways. I hope things get better for you.
If you got family that love you and you are willing to stay clean and healthy; reach out for support.  Have them help you get better. You can :)"

schizophrenia,finbdh5,t3_f8rx4d,1582560005.0,"It sounds like she may be generally unhappy and perhaps in a depressive episode and taking it out on you.  You said this was a side to her you said youve never seen before; then hopefully this is situational.  You mentioned she values being independent, but currently has to live with her younger sister because of a break up.  Yikes...she may also harbour a little resentment towards you as well if you are young, healthy, and independent.  Life with this condition is difficult, but its not an excuse to talk to you and behave the way she is doing in your home.  Is she currently able to work, volunteer, or take up hobbies she enjoys that can provide some meaning and purpose in her life?  Is she in a place where she can work towards being independent (own home, vehicle, etc)?"
careerguidance,fil8mp5,t1_fil2v1c,1582496041.0,"I think that depends on how you are paying for school.  Family? Student loans? Trust fund? Pay yourself?  The less student loans the better.  My student loans prevented me from buying a house because of my debt to income ratio.  But I will say in my area there are accelerated nursing programs for people with degrees already. I am not sure if that is offered where you are though.  I believe some accelerated programs are 16 months. Oh yea, I know its difficult and you just want to get the ball rolling!  Think of what your 10 year self would want you to do now?  Set yourself up for success in your future."

careerguidance,fil0idd,t3_f8f67f,1582491033.0,"I would honestly reccomend 1 or 2.  3 seems like a option that may sound good right now.  However, there is not many lucrative careers that are requesting a BA in Comm.  I minored in comm during undergrad.  The classes were fun and interesting. Option one offers good pay with niche options in nursing according to your interests.  For example you could pursue psychiatric nursing.  You could also continue on to grad school and become a nurse practitioner.  Look at and compare personal interest, pay, job market demand, and long term employment security :)"
