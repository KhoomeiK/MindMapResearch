I ended up doing everything for her because she wouldn’t touch any supplies and she didn’t want to “overexert” herself by reaching up to the taller cabinets to get supplies. She told everyone she was pregnant as soon as she got her blood test, then miscarried at 6 weeks (after I was done working with her.) I don’t *ever* want someone to go through that, but theres a reason why you don’t announce a pregnancy until 12 weeks, especially if you’re 37 and at high risk like her. She just wanted everyone to know ASAP so they could cater to her and fawn over her. It was so disgustingly obvious. Plus, she was always farting and burping and didn’t try to be polite about it, just let them rip and laughed about it bc she was sewww pregnant, hehehe! 

Before the miscarriage, she was talking about how she wasn’t going to vaccinate her kid because there’s “weird stuff” in vaccines.

Employment law has to change, and it shouldn’t be shouldered by workers when we have people in place who are supposed to legislate on our behalf. No one should be expected to sue their employer if that employer is not following the law. Report it, yes, you have to or else no one will know there’s a problem. But to have to go through the hell of a lawsuit that could take months-years is not in most people’s schedules.

This ED is part of why ER reception nurses are often so rude and dismissive. My sister has a congenital heart condition where she randomly goes into tachycardia. I’ve had to take her to the ER several times because she has to get a shot to slow down her heart rate when it happens because it will not slow down on its own. Unfortunately her symptoms present as anxiety to someone like an ER receptionist, so she never gets prioritized. We had been stuck in traffic for about an hour and a half, but I was relieved when we got there and the waiting room was empty. Fully empty. My sister couldn’t really talk so I was explaining her condition to the reception nurse. She didnt respond or look at me and just handed her the paperwork. I told the nurse again, this is really serious, it’s a diagnosed condition and if her heart rate keeps up like this her heart could give out. “Just fill out the paperwork and someone will be with you shortly.” So like 30 mins later someone comes to get her for triage. At this point she’s had a dangerously high heart rate for 2.5 hours. When they finally checked her her vitals they immediately called a code and got her on a gurney and wheeled her back. 

I just feel like there’s more that could be done to evaluate people entering the ER. Like in your story some of the people with sick kids were told to go home to treat symptoms because it wasn’t serious enough to be there. When you go to the front desk she/he just takes your basic info, she’s not evaluating anything other than obvious signs of like, dying I guess. It seems reasonable to send a couple triage nurses into the waiting room ever 10 mins or so to just kinda make sure no one is dying less blatantly than vomiting blood. But in my case the waiting room was empty. Makes zero sense."

Yippee.

Benzos are no fucking joke, whether you’re using them recreationally or they’re prescribed. You have to be so careful. I know many people with anxiety disorders who need benzos for panic attacks, so I won’t say they are bad across the board. It is a necessary medication in certain short term situations.

Once I was at my friend’s house (we were 12-13) and was feeling snacky so I asked her if I could grab something to eat. She said she wasn’t hungry but I could go make some microwave popcorn. I go downstairs to the pantry and as I’m looking for it, her stepdad comes in and fucking *lays into me,* saying that it’s rude to go through people’s things when you’re a guest and how did my parents raise me to be so rude...I wanted to explain that my friend gave me permission, but I just started bawling right then and there. He chuffed and rolled his eyes and walked away. My friend was like wtf happened? So I told her and she’s like yeah he’s a douchebag, sorry. That was just normal behavior for her stepdad to be mean to her friends. He was such a miserable prick. My parents didn’t let me go over there after that and I was totally fine with it.

Her mom was just as awful. When I would stay over she would be like “substitutebusdriver, you can have as many donuts as you want but Friend can only have one donut and an apple.

If you have real reason to suspect there’s something going on, talk to him about it. It doesn’t sound like you do other than your unfounded assumptions she’s only dating someone to get close to him. He will likely resent you if you don’t let her come. She’s obviously a good enough friend that he wants her standing next to him above all others.

**Why don’t you go out to drinks with them?** Maybe if you tried to get to know her you’d really like her. This would help with your insecurity. Make an effort to be friends with your husband’s friends. You are going to be *married*, you’re not just dating."

raisedbynarcissists,fpnxiae,t3_geb9s4,1588774555.0,"Nothing will make a narcissist see they’ve done anything wrong. They are masters at shifting blame. It’s literally their life’s work to get people to love and respect them through manipulation and lies. 

I don’t even know what you would do in order to let people know the truth. I don’t know exactly what she does is who is recognizing her as a parenting expert. But it’s unlikely that you’d get a large enough platform to really out her. If she writes books about parenting, contact the publisher. If she does seminars, contact them. Otherwise you could just make a website and link it everywhere she is advertised. 

I think no matter what you do, you’re intimately only doing it for yourself because she won’t ever take responsibility. She might pretend to, but people with personality disorders by their very nature cannot accept that they were wrong. But I do think it’s important that people know she’s no kind of expert about anything other than being a piece of shit to her kids. Narcissists think they are experts on fucking everything.

The best way to fight a narcissist is to not engage. Nothing makes them crazier than feeling like they can’t control everything."

I hope you have the time and energy to take care of yourself right now. And yes, lol they would totally just tell you to take Tylenol and use a warm compress. Don’t need to make a copay to do what I already do anyway.

The only thing in my experience that actually helps with the pain is prescription painkillers. People don’t realize that’s how bad the pain is. But they’re only a solution if someone has the discipline to take them only if it’s unbearable. I don’t have that control, so I ended up with an opioid addiction for about 5 years on and off. Clean since 2016, but my pain levels are higher than they were before the drugs altered my brain. I’d have to take a *lot* of painkillers to get any effect."

Hidradenitis,fpnnobq,t1_fpnlk11,1588768345.0,"I actually know someone with CIP (congenital insensitivity to pain) and you can hurt yourself throughout your entire life doing simple things, not just as a toddler. I totally get what you’re saying, I know you’re half joking, but I wouldn’t wish it on anyone now that I know how hard it is! She has to temperature check everything she eats. Her life is an endless cycle of routinely checking her body for injuries and paying extremely close attention to anything she does that could *possibly* result in injury. It’s actually similar to pain disorders in that it prevents you from living a “normal” life.

I think the main takeaway is that there are so many people going through secret pain (or lack thereof in rare CIP cases, lol) and we all want to keep it to ourselves because people will call us whiny for complaining, and with HS we feel “gross” because we have infected cysts and not just pain. It’s good that people are talking more about these invisible disabilities. But there’s still so many people suffering trying to lead a normal life and don’t even know there are so many other people like them. I think about how long it took me to get diagnosed with HS and what a relief it was to know it wasn’t because I was “dirty” and that there were things I could do to manage it. I am so lucky I got diagnosed so young (20) because I would have just kept thinking it was freaking ingrown hairs like every single doctor told me until the dermatologist was like “oh, I know exactly what’s going on.” It was like a huge weight was lifted! I know that sharing my story has resulted in many people finally getting diagnosed because they knew the right questions to ask. That’s why I love this sub. Everyone is so supportive."

And I totally agree, the women who are trying to take away abortion rights don’t have any stronger an argument either just because they have the ability to bear children. I think that people’s personal experiences are the most valuable when it comes to these issues and we should listen to them first. If we didn’t listen to women with direct experience, we wouldn’t know what the problems are with restricting abortion. But attempts at silencing certain people’s opinions based on things they can’t control like their biology don’t help address the issue."
TrollXChromosomes,fpkv2w8,t1_fpksfhb,1588701542.0,"You don’t have to have a personal stake in the discussion, men who are pro-choice aren’t just pro-choice because it might affect them personally. Does that mean they can’t push laws making abortion more accesible? I don’t think that’s what you think, but that’s how the logic follows.

What I’m saying is that I don’t care what organs you have, everyone has a stake in this by being part of a society where not having access to abortion affects society as a whole. Does is affect women the most? Of course it does, as women are the ones having to make that decision and undergo the procedure. Should more women be in positions of power? Yes. And that would absolutely affect the way we legislate abortion rights. Does society need to realize that men make up the majority of people making determinations about women’s autonomy, and take action? Yes. But I fail to see how excluding men from the conversation because they can’t bear children is helpful. Some female politicians are doing absolutely everything they can to make abortion illegal, so their ability to bear children isn’t relevant either."

AmItheAsshole,fpkre76,t3_gdl6qi,1588699716.0,"This one *really* made me think. 

I’m going to say NTA, but a tiny bit reluctantly. Only reluctant because outing someone for an abortion is shitty. But collecting money based on a lie about a personal tragedy is even shittier. Once it’s out, she is going to get bombarded with angry people, but it’s probably the right thing to do. No one will get their money back but it will prevent her from swindling more people.

On another note...why are people just giving her cash for having had an alleged miscarriage a year ago? Because she’s depressed? The fact that people actually gave her money is the craziest part of the story to me.

Semi-related, I know a couple that crowdsourced both of their kids. They got enough people to donate money **twice** to pay for IVF. I don’t know what else to call that other than supremely tacky. But people gave willingly."
TrollXChromosomes,fpkm8go,t3_gdzdu2,1588697170.0,"I’m going to be that person and take issue with the “never bore a child” part. I get this is a meme and I understand the sentiment fully, but just because someone doesn’t have the ability to give birth doesn’t mean their opinion isn’t valid. I guess I have trouble with it because it undermines the logic of the argument and it’s kinda gatekeeping. Plus, women get abortions because they don’t want to give birth or can’t give birth safely.

That being said, men have the numbers when  it comes to political power. I’m not separating the problems of the patriarchy from the equation, because it’s an enormous part of it. It’s the same systematic bullshit we’ve seen used against women forever. But at the end of the day the argument comes down to bodily autonomy, and that’s a human issue, not just a women’s issue.

I hope that made sense and doesn’t come off as giving a pass to people who want to take away women’s rights. I am as pro-choice as it gets and I struggle with the fact that so many people make it a moral issue and ignore science and reason. Pro-choice is the right stance regardless of your own reproductive organs."
