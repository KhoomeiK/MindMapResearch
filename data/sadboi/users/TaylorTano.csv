I have a twin brother, and growing up, he was always so desperate for people not to constantly see us as a pair that he'd constantly be on my case about ""stealing his personality"". We couldn't have the same hobby. We couldn't like the same TV shows, or games, or books. If I ever got into anything my brother was already a pre-existing fan of, I'd hear nonstop about how I was ""stealing his personality and interests"". The thing was, I never actually did anything to spite my brother. I just liked the same stuff he liked. Looking back, he was undeniably being an AH trying to keep me from doing stuff just because he also did it, but I can see now that it stemmed from a place of genuine jealousy and hurt, because he just wanted to be viewed as his own person separate from me, who could be discussed proudly for his unique interests. It doesn't make the way he treated me right, but I understand where he was coming from. It's hard when it feels like you don't have anything that belongs to just you, and but especially when it's more of your parents' fault, and it becomes easy to project that frustration onto your sibling.

toystory,fpkbhku,t3_gdpiu8,1588691633.0,"Man, one of these days I really need to write up a big long post analyzing Toy Story 4. Obviously, people are allowed to dislike things for their own reasons, but I feel a lot of the hate Toy Story 4 gets is from people not actually understanding the story story being told or how it factors into Woody's overall arc, which I think is undeniably ended better in this film than in 3, which was still a great conclusion, but maybe not as fitting for Woody (or the themes of the Series) as 4.

It's not ""out of character"" for Woody to be constantly driving the events of the plot by his own actions, because the movie is literally about Woody trying to insert some meaning and control into his life which has become largely meaningless. His quest to comfort Bonnie and take care of Forky ARE rooted in his loyalty as a character, but they're also excuses for him to feel important again, both to his owner and to the group of Toys. 

At the beginning of the movie, Woody has been replaced in two very important ways; The first, as a favorite toy, having been replaced by Jessie and subsequently, Forky. And secondly, as a Leader to the group of toys, which is the identity that Woody began to define himself by after Toy Story 3, because Dolly is already the de facto leader of Bonnie's Room. So this deprives Woody of both of his important roles, a toy and a leadership figure. When he tells Bo Peep that he has to save Forky ""because it's the only thing he has left to do,"" it encapsulates his entire character motivation in the movie. He has to do SOMETHING, because otherwise his existence is NOTHING anymore. It has no purpose. Forky's existential anxiety isn't a randomly inserted character trait. It serves as a direct parallel and foil to Woody's own ennui, telling Forky exactly what his place in the world is supposed to be while lacking that place himself. So he has to contrive reasons to feel like he still has a role in Bonnie's life. 

You see, a lot of people like to bag on Bonnie, the fucking 5 year old, for no longer considering Woody a favorite toy, (as if the random whims of children hasn't always been a major obstacle in these movies) but they fail to see how much that matters to the narrative of the film. Yeah, Bonnie's upset about Forky in the moment, but within a few days or weeks, she'd get over it. Just like she loved Woody one moment and neglected him the next. So Woody trying so desperately to get Forky back isn't actually about Bonnie like he claims it is, it's about himself. 

But like you said, this is selfish and ultimately hurts and screws up everything for everyone around him. That's literally the point, my dude. In the first Toy Story film, Woody is selfish and only thinks of himself and his wants/needs. From the end of that movie onward, Woody dedicates himself to helping others. Toy Story 4 is about Woody learning that it's okay, after the fight is over, to put down the badge, and take care of himself and his wants/needs (by staying with Bo), but in a way that isn't selfish or harmful."

I really struggle with this. I DO feel that I care about my education. I DO try. But there are also times that I just get so overwhelmed with it all, and then I start falling behind, and then I can't catch up. And then I either shut down and become super apathetic about it all (""what's the point of college if I won't live past 30?"") Or so anxious I can barely function. There were definitely classes I struggled with in high school, namely math and sciences, but I was a good student who took AP Classes, and had a good relationship with all my teachers. In college I just feel like I'm drowning, and it's become hard to even consider myself smart enough to stick with it or pretend that I'm still a good student. On one hand, I'd still like to think I care about my education and am trying my best, but when I fail almost every class for a semester, I don't really know what's supposed to differentiate me from those students that just don't give a shit."

AskReddit,fp5vjjn,t1_fp5u5z4,1588340843.0,"Save for a bit of S1 and S5 (which are still great), Bojack Horseman is easily one of the most tightly written and compelling television series of recent years, even if it doesn't seem that way from the start. It is insanely well-written and at points, gut-bustingly funny, but it also deals with a lot of not fun stuff. It very deftly walks a tightrope between being one of the best representations of mental health issues / general existential ennui in tv, and being too depressing for certain people to get into. The show itself always handles its topics really well (I.E. never romanticizing mental health issues and suicide like say, 13 Reasons Why) but the fanbase can have a tendency to lean really hard on the depression/mental health stuff and make it hard to forget that the show is also hilarious and mostly hopeful. The former is definitely the big compelling draw for people like me who've dealt with similar stuff (I don't think I've ever related more to characters in any other show, barring maybe Fleabag), but don't let that dissuade you from watching unless you think those topics will reinforce or pull you deeper into your own problems. I've rewatched Bojack a shocking number of times, and there were definitely a few of those times that it probably wasn't the best choice because of the way I personally allowed it to reinforce my depressive episodes."

-You're a big fan of horror in particular, and you might find beauty in things other people consider gross, scary, or unnatural

Neither Magic 8 Ball nor Bonnie's Rubik's Cube are animated sentient toys, not to mention letter blocks, dominoes, rock a stacks, and arguably Hot Wheels cars, among others, which are completely lifeless and stationary. At first glance, one could say that this is because these toys are faceless and non-personified. They're items and objects meant for play but not sentient characters, and can't take on a life of their own. 

After all, almost every actual character in Toy Story is somewhat humanoid or animal-like, capable of speech (or at least sound, movement, and emotion.  But there is a notable exception: Andy's See N Say and Speak and Spell (and arguably Etch). These characters are notable because they lack any humanoid features that would make them characters, but they're still capable of movement. Why is this important? Because we actually see another See N Say in Toy Story 3 who doesn't appear to be sentient. This is the yellow See N Say that Lotso's gang uses as a gambling table in the vending machine. 

So we have to ask ourselves, ""Why is Andy's blue See N Say an animated character, while the yellow one in Toy Story 3 isn't?"" And I think we find the answer to that in both Toy Story 4 and Toy Story That Time Forgot. Toy Story 4 reveals that any character-like creation or object (such as Forky) can be imbued with life if played with that way by a child. They have to be personified in the child's mind as a character in their imaginative world. It's very clear that not everything in the Toy Story Universe is alive, but there are objects outside of toys that do take on life if played with that way. Christmas Ornaments, like Angel Kitty or the ones mentioned in Toy Story 3 can be imbued with life if played with. 

This is why See N Say comes to mind... The reason why Andy's See N Say is a character imbued with life while the Sunnyside See N Say isn't, comes down to play. Andy probably used his See N Say as a character within his play world at one point or another (as he was known to do with most toys) and as a result, See N Say gained life. The same can be said for Forky and Angel Kitty. It could even be argued that characters like Hamm and Bo Peep were probably never meant to be alive, but were brought to life when Andy played with them as characters in his toy world. Things like the Magic 8 Ball and others both lacked the mobility and sentience to act as living toys, but also were likely never personified as characters within Andy's imagination and never gained life as a result. 

So we have some facts...

1. **Toys that were explicitly made to be toys, especially those that resemble humanoid or animal-like characters, are automatically capable of sentience and movement, even if they're not played with**. Stinky Pete is capable of these things despite never being taken out of his box. This is an interesting note because it seems like most toys don't seem to experience their own consciousness until they're removed from the box (like all the Buzz Lightyears in the aisle at Al's Toy Barn. Interestingly enough, a throwaway line from the Toy Story section of Kingdom Hearts 3 explains this, when Woody tells Sora that the inanimate toys in the toy store ""haven't figured it out yet"" in reference to movement.

2. **Faceless, Non-Humanoid or Non-Animal-Like toys that more resemble objects and items don't automatically take on life, but some probably can if personified as characters within a child's imagination**. The same goes for objects that are either created by the child as a toy or aren't explicitly designed to be toys such as Forky, Angel Kitty, and (again arguably) Bo Peep.

In any case, the key component here is interaction with a child wherein the toy-like object is personified within the child's imagination. Things that aren't inherently designed for child's play, based on what we know, don't automatically take on life. And even toys that are meant for children to play with, such as Magic 8 Ball, Lincoln Logs, Dominoes, and some toy cars, aren't automatically alive either. The difference between RC and say Barbie's Corvette, is that RC was viewed as a character within Andy's imagination while the Corvette was just a vehicle. 

Based on these facts, from a lore standpoint, it's unlikely that sex toys in the Toy Story Universe are alive sentient characters. I cannot actually believe I just typed all this shit out."

It would be one thing if she was a teenager/young adult, but she's literally just being open to trying new foods, and you punished her for that willingness. Be glad she's not picky and resistant to change. She couldn't know whether she'd like it beforehand, so you can't say that her not liking it is a ""lesson"" unless for some reason the lesson is ""don't ever try new things"". Why wouldn't you buy one Hawaiian Sausage and one new sausage instead of two of the new kind? I know you asked for your daughter's input, but I repeat, she's NINE, so the responsible parental thing to do, if you were buying two anyway, is to get the original flavor she likes as a fallback.


I legitimately don't understand what your perspective is here that you could possibly think this is teaching anything positive, or that she deserves to be punished for her willingness to try new foods. Are you mean or just really dense?"

AmItheAsshole,fjf9wcs,t1_fjf79pm,1583287383.0,"No, the word ""student"" isn't offensive or derogatory by itself. I agree with you there. But OP is only calling the student that in an effort to annoy them. They think they're showing the student the 'error of his ways' or 'giving him a taste of his own medicine' or whatever, but that's the difference. I genuinely don't believe there's maliciousness on the student's part (though obviously I can't say for sure). 

I believe it's simply an adjustment problem based in either habit, a differing belief of what constitutes a respectful address, or even just anxiety because it could feel intrinsically disrespectful on a gut level even if the professor indicates otherwise. Everytime they address the kid as ""student,"" OP on the other hand is purposefully calling attention to the student's failing in order to shame, embarrass, guilt, or simply mock the behavior, which again **Isn't even inherently disrespectful** because 'Professor' is literally their Title.  In my eyes, there's a bit more maliciousness on the part of OP but likely not on the student and that's why I think they're TA here. The problem isn't whether someone is being a hypocrite, but that the authority-figure adult in this situation is incapable of rising above the annoyance, and is choosing instead to be passive aggressive and petty about it. But I respect your differing view."
AmItheAsshole,fjf4kgy,t1_fjf2qy7,1583284172.0,"I don't think it could be convincingly used in the opposite case, at least not from my perspective. The professor is in a position of authority with a designated title. Most of the time, calling your college teachers ""professor"" other than their real name is a sign of respect and deference towards their role. Professors can have preferences and allow students to deviate, but to get passive aggressive about being called ""professor"" and do the same to a student is just fucking asinine and petty. While the kid probably could put in the effort to start using the professor's preferred name, he's not being outright disrespectful by simply using the title, which again, is both respectful and traditionally a force of habit (I personally address all my teachers as professor even if they've said we could use their name). By stooping and referring to the kid simply as ""student"" they're being intentionally disrespectful and lightly dehumanizing, which probably isn't the student's actual intention in doing the opposite."

It's helpful to be reminded that it's not personal... While the rational side of my brain tells me that old habits are just hard to change, sometimes it's difficult not to think she just does these things because she knows they annoy me. 

>On the flip side, your roommate may feel like your ideal way of life is very stringent and nitpicky, to the point of being controlling. Do you know how she feels when you move her things? It feels equally bad to be judged as the person who is not put together and who just wants to relax in their own home.

Yeah, I'm sure she probably does, and I feel really guilty about that. Like I said in the post, it's really hard to reconcile my general anxiety surrounding mess and clutter and my desire to be an amicable roomie who doesn't complain too much or who isn't overbearing and judgy, though I'm sure I probably come off that way sometimes when I don't mean to. 

When I move her stuff, I make sure to do it in a way that doesn't inconvenience her in any way (making sure her laptops are still plugged in, and that her books and bags are still together), I just move them out of the way, so they're not just sprawled across the floor. There have been a lot of instances where she's given me permission to do this (basically a ""it's fine as long as I don't have to do it"" type of deal), but most of the time it's sort of just a thing where my instincts kick in and I feel the need to clean up the mess a little before I do anything else (I'm a night owl, I don't intentionally stay up later than her solely for the purpose of moving her stuff). I don't want her to feel judged, so I'll try to curb this a little more, but I wish she could meet me halfway.

>With regards to cleanup after cooking, does she prepare meals for you? If so, I would jump on the cleaning as she's finishing up the cooking so you can get a head start on the mess before it gets hard and crusty. 

>Truth be told, cooking is an often underappreciated labor and I grew up with the ideology that whoever cooks, doesn't clean. That way everyone in the household has some responsibility associated with meal time. 

This is sort of part of the problem. Occasionally one of us will cook for the other person, but mostly we make meals separately so it's not really a division of labor sort of thing. I don't tend to use the kitchen as much as she does because a lot of my meals are things that I can microwave or eat without much preparation. The extent of my kitchen use most of the time is boiling soup on the stove, or putting some frozen food in the oven, and I always clean up after myself when I'm done so the kitchen is ready for her to use if she needs it. If I'm home when she cooks a meal for herself, I'll almost always try to get a head start on the cleaning if I can, but she also cooks a lot when I'm not there, so I'll come home to a ridiculous sinkload of dirty dishes and sticky countertops. Then if I need to cook myself, or just want the kitchen space to be clean, I'm the one who has to clean up her mess. I don't even really have a problem with the task itself (I like cleaning), but she makes it so much harder than it needs to be when she can't take a few seconds to make sure her pot of spaghetti sauce doesn't coagulate into a hardened mass I have to scrape off.  

>For the clutter, there are some possibilities depending on your specific issues.

Yeah, we try this as much as we can. We already have a shoe rack because that was an issue early on, and recently, I made her a coat hook by the door that she now uses instead of just tossing it on the floor when she gets in (despite us having a closet). The use of decorative items is also a really good idea!"

Sometimes I've felt it because I thought that a dramatic traumatizing event would at least justify my anxiety and suicidal depression. Then I could stop convincing myself I'm just faking it. 

But honestly, as for the biggest reason I've thought about this? Because it feels like it would add some meaning to my life... Now, obviously this is where fantasy disagrees with reality. Life isn't a story. Traumatic events aren't inherently meaningful. Even if someone goes on to use their experience to help others, the experience itself was senseless and damaging. But I think we all want to feel like we're the heroes of our own stories. We all wanna feel like we're at the center of a grand important narrative because then we can feel like our lives have meaning. When we have big tangible obstacles, we get to grow and develop and persevere. We get to be the hero at the end of the second act of a story, at their lowest point still deciding to actively push forward, and that's meaninful to us. 

But the fact of the matter, and what we have to struggle to accept, is that sometimes, our fight is just more mundane than that. That sometimes there is no big reason for why you feel what you do. There's no tangible force to fight, and no big tragic events that are gonna suddenly make things make sense or lend meaning to your struggle."

AmItheAsshole,fiki0ob,t1_fihv617,1582480729.0,"I agree with a lot of this comment. Granted, we don't know what OP's relationship with his parents is like outside of this one instance, but since OP doesn't frame their lack of support as a reoccurring pattern of behavior in his life, I think we can assume he's just bitter about the one instance. That being said, even if it could potentially apply to this situation, I don't agree that you're always obligated to show financial support to your family just because they did the bare minimum of raising you. Should you be grateful for your (non-abusive) parents and any sacrifices they made? Sure. Is giving them financial support when they need it a good kind thing to do? Absolutely. But I don't think that should ever be framed as the morally right thing to do because you're ""repaying"" them what you ""owe"". I'm not saying you don't owe your parents anything ever. Obviously most people get their start in life based on the work their parents put in beforehand and you can be grateful for that. 

But guess what? Raising your kid to adulthood, and not abusing them or leaving them on the street is pretty much already the #1 requirement for being a parent. You decide to bring a kid into the world, not the kid, and it's your basic lowest bar responsibility from then on out to keep them housed and fed. So you don't get to do the selfless job then and assume you can cash in on those points later like it's some kind of debt your kid owes you. Even if OP can afford it, most people can't. And they don't deserve to be guilted into feeling like they morally owe their parents anything simply because they committed the heinous crime of unwillingly being an 18 year financial burden on the people who CHOSE to bring them into the world already knowing the responsibilities and cost involved.

Also OP's parents don't seem to have actually asked for any money, So this doesn't even apply to them"
