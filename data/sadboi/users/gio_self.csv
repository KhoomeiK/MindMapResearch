In the WEST,  Yoga is generally thought to be a physical exercise of stretching."

TheMindIlluminated,exiqrmw,t1_exhdt6s,1566333722.0,"Very interesting. Do you have any reference as to the Suttas that mention Arhats behaving reprehensibly? 
If the remaining Suttas don't mention that, how do we have knowledge of it?"
TheMindIlluminated,exgsxdg,t1_exg7244,1566273864.0,"It takes no time to tell the truth. If one needs time it's likely to choose how to better ""dress"" the truth."
TheMindIlluminated,exgsq62,t1_exga809,1566273643.0,"If awakening means that this type of conduct is still possible, what is the meaning/value of awakening?"

Shameless plug, I know, but I think it will provide enough value that is worth the downvotes I'll receive from the Reddit Guardians."
Meditation,esvtrt0,t3_c8wx4r,1562304005.0,"I find that intense breathing exercises from Yoga, specially Bhastrika, usually do the trick.

Another way, much subtler, is to just step back and observe it all."
Meditation,esr9f94,t3_c8fo6m,1562219672.0,It has happened to me little by little. But what I realize is that it never feels like a loss‚Äîit's more like the feeling of outgrowing something. Just like you cease being interested in toys as you grow up.
Anxiety,esr8yw6,t3_c8fkpz,1562219364.0,"It may feel like that, if you get caught in the whirlpool of thoughts. Or you could try some deep breathing and meditation, right there in the moment. It will help you realize that, no matter how bad thoughts are, you are ""still ok"". Because you are not any of your thoughts‚Äîyou are the observer of thoughts."

Well done..."
Meditation,esjrgpc,t3_c7rnrw,1562039969.0,"Alcohol and mindfulness kind of go in opposite directions. And while it is not required that you give up alcohol to meditate, to the degree that you diminish the consumption, your meditation (and daily life) will benefit.

The real question for you is: Is alcohol worth it?"
Meditation,esgk9qu,t3_c7847f,1561955605.0,"When I was studying Zen in-depth, several years ago, it was one of my favorite books.

Having said that, I enjoyed the Compass of Zen better."
Anxiety,esdxos0,t3_c6lpnl,1561872436.0,"This can definitely work. It is a type of mindfulness practice, of being present in the moment (and not lost in our thoughts)."
Meditation,esdrq6s,t3_c6qui3,1561866523.0,"Most likely these are images surfacing from the subconscious mind. In some types of meditation this happens more than in others.

Just try to watch it all as a movie‚Äîwithout rejecting nor grasping, likes or dislikes."
Meditation,ergboul,t3_c1bdj7,1560832861.0,"The ego has a name, form, and attributes.

The observer has no name, no form, no attributes.

The ego is a thing. 

The observer is consciousness.

The ego comes and goes; it changes. 

The observer neither comes nor goes; it is changeless.

&#x200B;

The ego can be observed (by the observer)

The observer cannot be observed, as it's not an object."
