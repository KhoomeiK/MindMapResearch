Being interested in pegging brought me up against all kinds of feminization posts and discussion and I have to say, I found most of it grating and irritating. 

It seemed that frequently, it was acceptable/encouraged for men to take all the worst or most negative stereotypes of women they felt ""naughty"" when expressing (being bitchy, whiney, helpless, bimbofied, etc), and let those out under the guise of being feminine. I happened to think one time in particular *this would be like, if masculization was a fetish for women and all they did was wear torn up briefs and ran around yelling and breaking things*. 

I really like the answer up thread that getting to be feminine is seen as a reward, as a space for softness and positive emotions that maybe men don't feel they have access to when being masculine. To me, that's the corollary of a male dom helping his female sub direct her anger to action or take up more space for herself in the workplace in pursuit of her goals, etc."

Hands down, the words wife used here were awful. Should never have passed her lips. But, I also think the well is just poisoned at this point. 

Being put in a situation where you either have to lose your marriage or your sexuality is not an enviable position. And it sounds like they already had at least one child by that point. There's no way wife didn't factor in all the practical reasons for the relationship to continue during her week of thinking about it. 

It's frustrating to hear stuff like this because it seems to be related to two social factors that neither OP nor wife have any control over. 1- A decade ago, conversations about trans ppl didn't occur anywhere like they do now. 2- There's still a nagging assumption that, for some reason, straight women's sexuality is more ""fluid"" than other sexuality-gender combinations.

They give zero shits about how other people might be impacted by Braxxxtone and Bradenliegh playing with all the other neighborhood kids and accompanying them on every grocery outing because they're ""bored"".

Acceptably coded female behavior is so strict, so structured that it's not unreasonable for a brash woman to wonder if her personality is turning dominant men away. Think of how of often strong women's behavior gets coded as ""bitch"". 

I don't think enforcing gender neutral language on folks is beneficial. I mean, I'm a woman, I have a gender. Most times, if I have a question, I want information that keeps that detail in mind."
BDSMcommunity,fofhpyx,t1_fodx9km,1587736135.0,"As a married person who has permission to play around digitally, this...

>People who are emotionally stable and adult, kind and kinky, sex and relationship positive, AND single/available rarely stay single/available for long. 

is why a lot of us don't bother leaving. Even OP is in a presumably committed relationship (the ""third finding"" aspect seems to have mostly escaped discussion). If we're at least being allowed to play around (and if we're women, not being emotionally or physically abused) the raw likelihood of us finding someone better is roughly the height of moss in a forest ecosystem. 

Given what OP is offering - a digital experience with a couple for multiple people - it's hard to imagine expecting to be selected by a completely single and available person. Then, within the demographic pool they're likely fishing from, it's even harder to imagine expecting to be prioritized over the relationship that might contribute to putting a roof over someone's head, rearing children, or feeding themselves."

>when I'm speaking my sub will start making little noises or tries to make me moan, like she's trying to give me away

I'd be pissed as FUCK if one of my coworkers did this. We're in a meeting, trying to get shit done and half your brain cells are in ""teehee I'm being naughty"" land. Cut that the fuck out and thank every star in the sky you haven't been hauled before HR yet."

And I'm saying I like the thought, but not the language. Nothing insecure about it. The identity I vibe with is grown ass woman, not girl, and people are allowed to express preferences for the language their partners use to identify them. You can watch your words in any context. 

Like, I wouldn't tolerate my partner calling me a slut. In any context. That's not insecurity, that's a boundary. Same thing."

Like, for me, I was reading your questions and realized the first person to touch my tit was probably my pediatrician when I was getting a physical for high school sports. 

Awkward. 

There's a lot of women out there for whom their ""firsts"" are going to include some elements of non-consentuality/assault. Anyone looking to replicate this should probably keep that in mind."

On the other hand, fuck that. I'm 31 and don't you dare call me ""girl"" out of some paternalistic bullshit unless you want me to fling ""boy"" right back at you. 

So. Yeah. I need to find something else that lacks the insulting part lol."

Hell, I'm kink-aware and that's a *hard* limit. If you'd get pleasure from hurting me, but agree not to because I don't consent? Sorry, not a match."
