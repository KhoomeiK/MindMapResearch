I'm wondering if there is a specific ingredient that may be the issue (like, what would be a common one that people have bad reactions to?). also if anyone has any advice to get rid of this reaction thatd be amazing

ive never used this brand but impulse bought like 8 assorted masks from shoppers the other day"

a nurse named robin saved my finger. the dr who was supposed to do my surgery was gonna leave. she yelled at her and got her to sew my finger back on before she left. without robin, who i remember like 15 years later, i woulda lost my top bit of my pinkie

i came back later and gave her a big gift basket. it was my moms idea but im so happy she made me do that. she was so happy and kind and amazing. she said not many people come back after the fact,even tho she works at a kids hospital. 

i still remember and look up to her this day. i think just comin back later is important and memorable. i am obvs not a nurse but i think showing gratitude in any way after the fact is important. 

i hope one day i have the impact she had on me on another person"

my mom called me fat at 125 lbs at 5'1 around age 14. this continued thru my teen years where i would fluctuate between 120 and 150

 she claims now she was just trying to get me to be more physically active which i believe, but she worded it really shitty and for the past 6 years or so ive dealt with ednos, ranging from restriction, to purging (mostly vomitting but i ran to purge for a while), to binging and purging, etc.

AskReddit,eoi7mtd,t3_brzuwa,1558612781.0,"eating disorders are not a choice. we are not trying to induct people into having them. taking away safe spaces for people with eds just makes us hide them more because we know we are often percieved as gross or selfish. my teeth fucking hurt. 

also, not everyone with an ed is thin, white or female. eds can show up in any population. i do this because i need control of literally fucking anything. i have issues with perfectionism and purge as a form of self harm or sometimes i feel like its a form of self care (obvs its not but hey my brain thinks so). im an anxious depressed mild alcoholic who pukes up a lot of her food. 

i wish i was normal about food. even when i act normal, i have disordered thoughts. like can you imagine always having food and calories and shit on your mind? its fucking exhausting. idk where im going with this but please never tell someone to ""just eat"" or ""just dont purge!""

like fucking thanks never thought of that

edit: also addiction isnt a choice its a disease"
