BPD,fk8wcoz,t3_fh2moy,1583964132.0,"totally. i'll feel very physically weak and shaky, and my emotions for the next few days seem like dulled down versions of what they would be. i find what helps best for me is something that takes all of my attention, so there's no room for outside thinking. i usually turn to videogames."
BPD,fi3hast,t3_f63pk5,1582118924.0,"yeah, it feels genuinely unfair that i care so much about people but it's almost always unreciprocated. i know it's not anyone's job to love me or care about me... i just wish it was."
patientgamers,fhlmmcr,t3_f3e3gj,1581702293.0,"this is one of my most favorite games in existence, and i still have songs from the ost set as my alarm and ringtone. i'm not exactly sure what made me so captivated with it, but my interest hasn't faded over time in the slightest."
BPD,fhhxkxj,t3_f2t6od,1581613741.0,"yeah, i also do it to live vicariously through my past self that way i don't go through the motions of actually messaging someone and risking making a mistake lol. it didn't cross my mind that other people did this too."
BPD,fgpr7j1,t3_ezpbwx,1581010426.0,a lot of the time i find myself doing things that will make me disgusted with myself intentionally. or i'll intentionally find videos or stories that will trigger me and make me panic. i'm fairly certain that it's a form of self-harm.
BPD,fftye16,t3_ev5upy,1580230473.0,"i both completely agree with you and don't. i want the exact opposite-- i want to be perceived as normal. i don't like to label myself as crazy or insane, but i know my actions and emotions give it all away. with the way i act, it's hard to hide everything from everyone. the mania, how angry i can get for seemingly no reason, my panic attacks.

you're absolutely right. everything you've said is valid, and super relatable. i just wish it wasn't."
BPD,fels1ni,t3_epldwt,1579229522.0,"mania is nuts. i hit rock bottom and ran away from home one day, but because some people reached out to help me i was in ecstasy just a few hours later. these mood swings drive me crazy."
BPD,fe7r316,t3_enugyv,1578918211.0,"i really wish i didn't have emotions, or at the very least i could control them. i constantly feel like a ticking time bomb.

i'm sick and tired of feeling sick and tired."
BPD,fe4ktgs,t3_enm3lu,1578860378.0,"i can never enjoy anything in moderation. if i like something, i have to really really like it and know every single detail about it. when i start to lose interest in those hyperfixations, its less so because i'm sick of the content and more like it goes dormant. if i see something related to it a few months or even years later i'll still get excited over it."
BPD,fc0awks,t3_efgqu7,1577285383.0,"i'll be sitting at home and think ""i wanna go home."" i guess when i think of home i just think of someplace that's supposed to be comforting and safe. 
my home is neither of those."
BPD,fab2b3m,t3_e88n1j,1575916765.0,loud noises murder me. if i'm being touched and i didn't explicitly say i wanted to be in physical contact i can have a panic attack.  i have a huge fear of thunderstorms and i always jump and feel like crying when a loud sound goes off unexpectedly.

BPD,f8s8nn7,t1_f8rvimj,1574773453.0,"feel this one super hard. i've done this for a majority of my life, and i'll sometimes find myself looking in the mirror and i'll almost forget that i'm looking at myself. once i realize it's me i'll feel weirdly disgusted. can't stand people talking about my appearance, either."
BPD,f8006cq,t3_dy3ta1,1574118842.0,"god, yes. i have episodes, really really bad ones. i can keep them under control if i'm in public, but if i'm hurt badly enough i'll go out and do the craziest shit imaginable. luckily, most people are unaware of my bpd and take my manic episodes as just me putting myself out there. i try to avoid making plans with people that enable me unknowingly. SOMETIMES i can recognize i'm acting terribly and pull myself out of it."
BPD,f76m3ck,t3_dtwuc9,1573429964.0,"absolutely. that's always how i've described it. i had a close friend move away, and my mental health immediately stooped extremely low. i was fairly good at taking care of myself before, but i stopped showering, washing my face, brushing my teeth, and eating properly. i'm still kinda facing the reprecussions from not taking care of myself, haha. i'm acne prone with no skin care routine and i still have a few bumps and pockmarks from when i wouldn't take care of myself."
BPD,f6jlbwq,t3_driv97,1572896452.0,"yeah. sex repulses me to no end, but i'm also extremely hypersexual. a lot of it leads to me sometimes having panic attacks during sex, or just general discomfort overall. i have a lot of issues with my body image as well, so that doesn't help either. it's like i go between being the world's biggest prude to the most slutty person i know."

BPD,f44bz5w,t3_djbb6x,1571350200.0,"yup yup yup yup. i'm very picky with who i idolize, i have specific standards. i'll put someone on a pedestal, spill out everything that's ever happened to me, then get irrationally angry over them not caring about me, as if i'm entitled to it.  
like... REASONABLY, i know it isn't their job to give me attention. but. you know. whatever, i'll blow up at them anyways, despite knowing better."
