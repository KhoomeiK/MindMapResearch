Now how does one not be alone? The answer is c. Make your self a part of someone's life and that's how you will feel better. Walk up to a stranger and help them load up there car with groceries. Or lend a hand at work and help them make there task easier. You are in control of your life. You can make it how you want and it's up to you to do it.

You are telling yourself over and over you are alone. Your voice is a powerful tool so use it to benefit you. Tell your self I'm not going to be alone, I'm not going to wake up another day alone!! And dammit you wont be alone anymore.

######You are not alone"

It's been 7 months since I was involved in a vehicular accident that almost ended my life. I suffered from Post concussion syndrome which led to mild anxiety. It felt like I couldnot breathe at times due to the constant worry of my well being. Lack of motivation from the accident taught me to become extremely neglectful in my life towards important things that other people would get done in a habitual way. 

I woke up one day and just slammed my laptop on the ground and told myself I was not going to sit and be idle and waste my life playing computer games all the time. Dont get me wrong. Computer games or any games are ok to do but not when you are completely neglecting important things like I was doing. I just simply told myself that I need to change and I need to start thinking rationally and make decent decisions for myself. The whole point of this is to say that even though I  have a small case of anxiety I will say that from what I learned its manageable and even though there may not be an instant cure for it, it does get better over time and I found out that staying motivated helped me to get well.

I'm checking in now to say that I hope anyone who reads this finds a manageable way to deal with this as well. I know it gets tough and life has a way of giving you s***"

I feel like if we were ""Shadow banned"" than it would have to be the post and all future posts right? Because it would seem weird if someone just monitors every single post you send. There has to be some ""Automated"" process involved. I think mods can do it as well but on a less effective level. Less permissions given to mods"

depression,eywfchz,t3_cz4ckx,1567528184.0,You are the only one that can decode what you are thinking.  Obviously you know what you need to feel better and I have no doubt that one day you will find it. I too seek the same thing one day. We just have to have faith that one day we will find that person who can give us close contact. and dont dwell on the past for to long. No one can change what has happeneed in the past. What is done is done. Dwell on the future. No harm can happen thinking about the future. Lift your self up and tell yourself that you are going to get that some day. And it will happen.

It's something that just happens, there is no control of it without time.Sorry if I feel the way I feel I mean how do people think I'm supposed to act like if someone I truly loves packs there bags and leaves me. It's a natural way to act like. It's not a Personal choice and I'm damn sure not going to act fake in this world. If I loose someone I really care about am I supposed to just walk around like everything is happy? I think not."
depression,eyucbos,t3_cym2hs,1567458400.0,"I could kill myself now and have more recognition now than I ever would have before based off my wealth or what I'm worth. And this also happens to some singers and other figures. It's just what happens.  Same thing with antique. A car isnot antique till after its ""dead"" meaning no longer produced. Which means people put care into what ""something"" or who ""someone"" is until after it or they are no longer existing. It is kinda funny but in the same sense it's really depressing to think about."
depression,eyuavqb,t3_cysmwc,1567457343.0,"My mothers dog died from a seizure in her arms. She held her head up so she would not suffocate, but eventually died. She had a known history of seizures that my mother knew before she purchased it, but the dog just barked and wagged its tail at my mother in the cage, saying ""Take me home"". The were best friends. My mom would play computer games with her on her lap wrapped up in a blanket. She was a small dog. A miniature Dachshund mixed with a black labrador so she looked a little bit taller. She was a cute dog. She had back problems too. If the seizures didn't kill her than I'm pretty sure she would be suffering  from back trauma now. She always had seizures in the middle of the night. I would just hold my hands to my head and close my ears because there's nothing you can do to a dog that's just in that state. Just have to let it go naturally. After she had a seizure she ran out the door so fast and we couldn't find her! Me and mom and my brother walked to the cable company,  (privately owned small RIP off company) and we saw her playing with this other dog that technically we owned and fed but never stayed at our house unless it was raining ðŸ˜Š . The most unloyal but playful dog I have ever seen ahah. I mean hell that dog was big and afraid of rainstorms and my dad got tired of fixing the screen door all the time from her so he dropped her off about 15 miles away at a abandoned sub division. But one day she managed to find it's way back to our house ðŸ¤”.  She was loyal enough to love me and my brother so much!! I dont miss my mothers dog not one bit. But I do miss the relationship that she had with it. It made me feel good to see my mom have a ""friend"". No matter how small or big a dog is they always have the same qualities about them when they are treated right. I used to have two twin labs. One was black other was golden. Still they were twins regardless of color because color was the only thing that looked different on them. I do agree with you. Man's best friend. At least it was for my mother who had owned a lot of dogs with various problems in her life. She had one dog named eve. Because she was born on Christmas eve and we bought it from the ""big"" house me and my brother called it. It was like 2 miles away from our house and as a kid you know everything looks large but the dog ended up having extremely bad stomach problems and my mom saw it in the woods trying to grasp for air. We used to own two twin cats, named bert and erney but erney had a stomach ulcer in the bathroom and had to go to the humane society to be euthanized. I had one cat named skitty sue. And it ended up living for 14 years straight. It had a 7 year vanish point in life and finally showed up in our yard 7 years later. You never know about pets,  sometimes they are fine and the next thing you know all you have is just a bunch of cheerful memories with them to reminisce on."

We should find a way to make changes in our lives. Even a small baby step is better than nothing. Eventually those baby steps will become much larger ones. It takes time to make changes. The fact that you have noticed how you feel is great! You are letting your self know that ""YOU"" want to make a change. Having a desire or motivation to change is difficult under depression,  which makes you unmotivated with no desire to do much of anything. What I usually do is try and stay busy doing something or keep my mind occupied doing something. I hope things look up for you in the future!! ðŸ’ª"
