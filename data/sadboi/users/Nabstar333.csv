netsecstudents,ffs3o7c,t3_euql8a,1580172339.0,What are SMB places
csMajors,ffrslt7,t1_ffrc779,1580164908.0,"POSt is difficult honestly because of the transition from hs to uni. You have more freedom, but also more responsibilities. There’s also the perseverance you must learn when you don’t understand something, especially in math and cs. Unlike hs, anything that was talked abt in lecture, even if it wasn’t emphasised, is fair game on tests and exams. If you really want to study cs then you should have no problem doing what ever it takes to make sure you get the maximum out of your courses. You need to make the effort to go to Office hours the professor will not make sure you understand it during lecture due to time constraints. I suggest you follow the same learning techniques you learnt in hs. If you see an unfamiliar concept then read up on it yourself, don’t wait for anyone. For your first year I wouldn’t recommend building any side projects, but rather take your time to adapt to the culture at Utm and be open to change because it’ll be big. Second year you can focus on side projects and infact the assignments in your courses are definitely worth featuring on your resume as not all of them will have starter code. I did still find it challenging to develop side projects during the year so I suggest you find a partner or dedicate your Christmas and summer break to projects. 3 weeks is plenty of time for you to develop one."
csMajors,ffr9fm4,t1_ffqyt2d,1580153333.0,"yes you will need the science credit or you can possibly take the science credit at utm or ryerson. I would say you will have to understand every single thing that is taught in the course and if you don't you will have to grind till do. You will struggle regardless of your mark in high school. Most students drop 15% average in their first year leaving you with a 75% average which is basically the POST requirement. Whatever you do, just make sure you keep a CGPA above 2.8 to give you a good chance to transfer. Also lucky for you SAC was implemented so you can always repeat core courses you've passed to get a higher mark and replace your GPA. Let me know if you want to know anything else."
csMajors,ffpv0ra,t3_eu89oi,1580106756.0,"I go to Utm and study cs. I can tel you POST will definitely not be easy. You will definitely struggle if ur not already a high 80s student. Keep ur options open though. In December when u start, apply to ryerson, Sheridan college, and other schools just in case you don’t get in. PEY is definitely worth it. Pros are you can choose your employer, salary, the length of time (12-16) months, and the continuous year of working means you get to see a project all the way through. Cons are you’re responsible for finding a position, you need to standout from the crowd, not everyone gets a position, your placement must be between 12-16 months (no exceptions), if you don’t like the company you chose well looks like your stuck there and you are taking an extra year to complete your education (not a big deal for most people).

I do want to continue climbing the mountain it’s just sometimes I feel my mind diverts me to the pain of my ex a lot and it’s difficult to keep it in check. Sometimes I end up spiralling into a zone of negative thoughts without even realising it. I end up wasting both time and energy on a making myself feel like shit, involuntarily ofcourse. I want to love myself, but I think I also need a better self image, both physically and mentally. A new set of values and habits to go by. I listen to people more than I listen to myself for the fear of making a mistake and being looked down upon. One last thing is I’ve noticed now that I’m not a teenager anymore that life really can be unfair. Not everyone climbs the same mountains as u do and gets to even higher altitudes. And those that do climb them seem to do it with ease. I feel that others don’t have the mental challenges I have. They seem to be comfortable with solitude, have less stress on their mind and don’t seem to be affected by having a boring life. There will always be that person who doesn’t work as hard as u to get where they are and that really bothers me. It’s breaks the very foundation of working hard leads to success. Lately I’ve been thinking to myself why even bother struggling climbing a mountain when they’ll always be that person with a helicopter. What’s the point? Some are just lucky whether it be talent, skills, money, good genes or looks or knowing the right people. You see examples like these in everyday life, and the fact is we’re not all made the same. As an adult I’m slowly starting to realise that luck plays a huge factor in success. I’m starting to question wether luck> hard work. So far no ones has been able to shine some light on this. No one has been able to tell me straight up that luck is non existent. Maybe you can help me with my dilemma"
