When I got engaged people seemed to be solely focused on the ring and even though I adore my ring, something about people's attitudes towards it always made me cringe.
What matters most is that you like it and you're happy with it.
It's not about the ring at all, it's about the meaning behind it.
Some people are just toxic who feel like their greatest achievement in life if to be gifted a bigger rock. Don't let them pull you down to their sick mindset."

I also had a strained relationship with my dad for years and actually hadn't spoken to him in the last 3.
He was banned from my wedding before I even knew I wanted to get married. In the end he did me the favor of dying before I got engaged so now I don't have to worry about that and the drama he was obviously gonna create.

If you feel like having your dad there won't add to anything but would actually cause you problems, then I say don't invite him and enjoy your special day with the ones who actually care about you and your partner."

Obviously FSIL meant to do this as a nice gesture and meant no harm by it.
Instead you are taking this and making a mountain out of a molehill instead of being thankful for the nice gesture she tried to have towards you.

So the store was mistaken and accidentally called you. Instead of loosing your marbles and being angry at her, you should have been thankful.
You already love the dress. Getting rid of it because this situation got you nervous is just throwing a temper tantrum."

At the beginning I started with my sister (MoH) helping me out to scout places and she'd go visit the venues we liked the most, since she has her own life and I understood that she wouldn't have time to visit all of them or meet up with all the vendors.

So we decided to get a wedding planner that was within out budget and have had Skype meetings with all of our vendors so far. Some of the payments we've done via PayPal and some of them through back transfers, it depends on what the vendors prefer.

I'll be buying my dress here and taking it with me on the plane. We're arriving to Mexico around two weeks before the wedding and have the menu tastings then."

If talking to your brother doesn't help, then my advice is this:
As someone who went through this with parents who didn't try to change it at all and couldn't be bothered with ending their toxic relationship, all I can suggest is that you remain as someone whom your nephew can confide in. 
It would be good if he could go to therapy in order to help him deal with such an unstable home environment and to help him learn about setting boundaries with what his parents share with him.

Best of luck."

I had considered getting a MUA since I was going for a vintage look and was really scared of messing it up, but she ended up not being available.

If you're gonna do your own makeup, I recommend you start by choosing what kind of style you want and what best matches the outfit. Then, look up references of said makeup styles to get ideas and maybe some youtube tutorials.

As for brands.. I honestly went with partial drug store brands for foundation, concealer, etc and urban decay for eyeshadow.
I'd focus on taking great care of your skin in the meantime so no matter what, it looks good on that day.
I even bought moisturizing face masks for both of us to use the night before lol.
