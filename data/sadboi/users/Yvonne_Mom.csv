Landlords and mortgage companies will “delay” payments, but eventually want all of their money. 

People are laid off in most every industry. It is very plausible that 50 out of the 56 are unemployed. Why is there this overall idea that tenants and homebuyers will just *come up with* the remainder at some point? Why is there this idea that people will just *have* enough money to pay everyone and eat and get necessities?


If some of them are just trying to “get over”, it’s probably because they’re afraid they won’t have money at some point and are trying to save to make sure they have *some* money when they might most need it. Or they’re jerks too. 


Unless your tenants are all scumbags, I’m sure they worked hard to get to where they are too. 

Try to work out something with them instead of forcing homelessness at some latter point in the year. It’s a pandemic, an act of nature that no one saw coming.

Even my youngest who is now 5, so thankfully I’m out of the full-time childcare, but now part-time child care has gone up within the last 5 years too. 

I just told my husband how almost every bill we have had increased this year, with an email/me having to call and see what’s the problem with all of them. Rents have skyrocketed, cell phone, internet/cable (which I never used to have cable but I got it to switch from my previous provider and the cost was only a bit more, but then it went up this year and they’ve made it where if you drop cable, your internet cost is the same as the internet/cable bundle), car insurance crept up even with a new quote, my contact lens exam doubled since I last got one 2 years ago, and others. 

Meanwhile, companies are paying nothing. There are no jobs for stay at home parents who are re-entering the workforce and have to start at the bottom again, because family and hours are so demanding. These money-making apps are basically paying to hold you over in the meantime, because i was basically just making my gas back driving for food delivery in my SUV.

Also, idk if you’d like to try a topical antibiotic? Maybe then you can apply every other day? Just to lessen your usage."
tretinoin,fjz6fso,t1_fjz3tml,1583712468.0,"Happy for you!

I’m wondering if I should go down to 0.05 from 0.1, I can’t use it without a buffer and I can only use it every other day. Your pics are motivating me to go for it!

Antibiotics: it’s probably helping with new spots that pop up, but I’m not sure if it’s as effective as the Tret alone. And the new spots could be coming from diet or other products."

Other than that, no. No one can just be alone with my child. The story and your example aren’t the same."
intj,fjkfgrb,t1_fjjdpr3,1583425911.0,Ditto. I feel like there’s a correlation for me with my narcissistic mother. My entire personality/INTJ is most likely because of her.

She’s right. I ended up so stressed at a toxic company that I experienced Bells Palsy. In my 20s. It’s not worth it. Mainly female department, 90% female management, and they were disgusting human beings. Judgmental, condescending, gossiping, gaslighting, all that. I ended up laid off at 8 months pregnant, a month after my husband was laid off. I no longer desire to work in corporate America in any capacity. 

Giving you all the “new job” vibes I can!!

Edit: how unprofessional is it that they survey the office about how people feel about you in the first damn place? That will make those already feeling superior feel EVEN MORE superior, with no reason behind it! Thus causing even more pathetic drama. Smh."

I was and sometimes still am you, but I catch myself bitching and I’ll tell him I’m sorry, I’m frustrated and it’s not you it’s me and I love you. 

You’re learning! Be better for him, be better for YOU. And don’t be afraid to tell him these words! He will love it and the bond will grow deeper, I promise!"
