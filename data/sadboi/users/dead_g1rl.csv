benzorecovery,fo525k4,t1_fo51t4i,1587515893.0,to be fair it was worse before i re instated. but yes.
benzorecovery,fo5146l,t3_g55xd5,1587515268.0,"my most vivid memory from withdrawal will always be this.... it was right after i re instated a taper from going cold turkey. 

i was hanging out in my room watching anime and i suddenly got a huge wave of derealization. i stepped outside to try and smoke a cig but by the time i was going to light my cig i was already shaking uncontrollably. i ended up laying on the ground while massive waves of panic washed over me, all the while i began to sweat buckets and have auditory hallucinations. cue the deja vu, which after a couple rounds turned into an intrusive memory. slowly but surely i kept breathing, and after an hour it faded away. 

thought i was having a heart attack. i was sure it was the end. i remember i called my mom and was begging her to take me to the hospital but i was able to wait it out."
benzorecovery,fo50pia,t3_g5p1fm,1587515024.0,"i actually quit smoking two months ago because of how it was reacting to my body post-taper. i had physical and mental symptoms that i never had before my taper, like my blood pressure and heart rate would go up and so would my anxiety. after i quit the vape it was pretty hard for 2-3 weeks but totally worth it."

benzorecovery,fn8o99c,t1_fn7alog,1586746180.0,"i am a female and i actually just finished my period the other day, which is coincidentally when my migraine headaches started. taking headache pills (aspirin and acetaminophen) helps it go away but so far for 3 days it just comes right back after the medicine wears off. super annoying as i never had this feeling before benzo withdrawal. i’m glad i’m not alone."

benzorecovery,flzozpx,t3_fs3kk3,1585629292.0,"no, it does cause panic attacks though. it’s going to be ok, it will eventually pass. i admitted myself to the emergency room twice during the peak of my withdrawal for the same reason, only to be sent home after having normal readings (other than the tachycardia). got diagnosed as anxious both times. i get where you are coming from."
benzorecovery,flzoqqw,t3_frxk1b,1585629093.0,"a HUGE thing for me after i finished my taper was sensitivity to sound, especially when falling asleep. i would say it lasted for about 4 months but luckily it did get better :) still dealing with some other symptoms but taking it one day at a time really helps!"
benzorecovery,flgjkmq,t3_fomy5v,1585144140.0,"ugh yes. i hate to say it but yes. i thought i would treat myself to some wine the other night and wow. what a terrible decision. being drunk was fine but as soon as i started to sober up i had a panic attack, for no reason. my heart just started beating as fast as it could. 

i know it sucks but definitely don’t drink. not for about a year i would guess after you completely taper down."

benzorecovery,fkpkbko,t1_fkpg79k,1584412196.0,"my taper was actually started from a point of instability i would say. i was admitted inpatient originally and was unintentionally cold turkeyed. i was actually told by my psychiatrist at the time that there was no way i was addicted and i believed him, therefore i never would have thought. anyways about 2 days into my hospital stay i started having horrible horrible symptoms of derealization that led to a seizure. after that they gave me a single dose and then cold turkeyed me again. it was only when i was discharged that i was able to start a taper of my own in which every 2 weeks i tapered down half of what i was taking."

HealthAnxiety,fkc97vv,t3_fgv7o0,1584048302.0,less than a week ago i finally went to the psychiatrist. i was prescribed gabapentin and propranolol. i have had a really hard time with the propranolol because it freaks me out when my blood pressure drops but it made it physically impossible for me to have the bodily symptoms of a panic attack when i was on it. i also got silexa which is lavender. too early to tell.
