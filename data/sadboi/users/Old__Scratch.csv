I nearly cured my schizoaffective disorder with hallucinogens, primarily with salvia divinorum. Many other herbs have supported and helped me along the way, however it was psychedelics that changed everything. The cantelmoism thing is a crock of shit, and I ended up getting in an argument in which I won with the founder regarding his beliefs.

Alcohol definitely is increased in effects, but I used to be able to drink a quarter bottle then go take my seroquel and be fine.

1. No extracts
2. By yourself, but not entirely alone at first (ie, someone in another room)
3. Setting up and creating your space, perhaps an alter of sorts or a safe, open area. 
4. Do it with a set intention. 
5. Listen to music that you have a spiritual affinity towards, it will keep you somewhat grounded, calm you and help direct your experience into something spiritual and useful. Also, Salvia likes some music, and hates others. It's not exactly cut and dry, but as you experiment with it you'll get a feel for it.
6. Meditate beforehand 
7. Do not get up, preferably for an hour. Contemplate what you're experiencing. Close your eyes and absorb everything you can. 
8. Keep a journal handy, write anything you find to be important the second you're coherent enough to write. You will likely forget the important things if you dont write it down
9. You can always redose, so just take it slow. Forming a healthy relationship with the plant is essential. 
10. Learn to let go entirely. Your essence is your sacrifice in exchange for divination and knowledge.

I've been able to alter my life permanently through it, its shown me people's true intentions  the flaws in my life, the imbalances I hold, the fears I possess, the things I value, the things I need to do in order to alchemize my soul, etc. Not to mention it nearly cured my schizoaffective disorder and I no longer need medication because of it.
