>A big problem that a lot of people have is worrying too much about other drivers - whether it be the pressure of having a car behind you, not knowing someone else’s intentions/other cars being unpredictable, or even impatience for cars in front of you - it’s important that you just worry about yourself and YOUR safety. Some people will tailgate you and it’s irritating & definitely adds to the anxiety but you have to remember that your safety is more important than their patience and that they’re the ones in the wrong. There’s absolutely nothing wrong with you going the speed that you feel the most safe going, as long as it’s not faster than the speed limit

this part scares me, I tend to think about that when I drive slowly, other people are mad. and I can see their faces through my mirror. I do drive a bit slower just to make them overtake me. but sometimes it put pressure on me to drive faster but then I stop cause I feel im going to fast (even though originally I was driving at 35-40 kmh then when their near me, I go to like 45-50 kmh). I don't know how I will be able to drive more than 70kmh on the highways. even 40-50 is fast for me. I think went that happens when someone is near my car, I just get so panicked and I need to find a way to stop that. 

&#x200B;

again thank you so much !!!"
driving,fhnvu44,t1_fhn9ls7,1581733708.0,"I can’t imagine driving a manual car! I feel like if I drive a manual car, i wouldn’t be able to move the car even. 

That is true.... driving alone is better. When i was driving wity that family member, they were just stressing out alot and sighing alot..... and just raising their voice and that made me more stress..... 
like today, i went out driving alone early morning... i still sticked with driving in my neighbourhood (i’ll branch out soon) n had a podcast playing n it was nice. It was raining too, and usually I avoid it when it rains but today I didn’t. I think its my first time driving in the rain. I had the wipers on and its dumb but i felt a little tiny bit proud - driving in the rain..... 

“. Something that helped me massively was to find a marker to line up so I know how close I can get to passing or parked cars without touching (for me it is where the left windscreen wiper rests.) “

Would you mind explaining this part? I would also like to do something like that. Im always nervous when im driving beside a car or when the overtake me. Eventhough my car is tiny, i feel like im so very close to the other car.

But i still think notes and tips are helpful at least for me. I’ve been watching lots of vids on parking yesterday for example

I would like to go to a grocery store but where i live, the grocery store is not a super market with their own parking lot. I wish there is one nearby but the one grocery store we have is near a busy u turn area and car park spaces (like with lines) does not exist. 
But i do live near an area that has like parking spaces with lines. So i went thete twice with the family member and didn’t succeed getting the car into the damn box. And my car is a really tiny car. 

Mine was the same too in the beginning with the instructor but then once i was okay, we were fine and i felt extra fine when we had conversation. Like i could drive and concentrate and speak . Now nonexistent

driving,fhk62k9,t1_fhjz3qw,1581668508.0,"Thank you for your reply.

When I was done driving with that family member, I just went and cried my eyes out alone. I'm so bad.

&#x200B;

as you mentioned, anxiety is definitely making everything worse. I had this in the beginning when I was learning with my instructor, like really bad until I would get super sweaty palms and my vision go blurry and stomach ache. but then after a few weeks, it disappeared like in a snap and I was fine. but this time, its been months (like 3 months) since I got the car and nothing had changed.

&#x200B;

that's what makes it worse for me, everyone can drive and what is wrong with me. there's something wrong with me. Im not even quick in changing my foot from the break to  the gas (I have an automatic car). even when turning out and into a opposite lane, im slow as well cause im afraid I won't have enough time to turn and there would be a car front of me when I turn.

&#x200B;

I was happy when I passed my test in one go, as I heard there were many people (almost half the class) failed from the test week before. I was confident then.

&#x200B;

tbh, I wish I was brave enough to drive alone (for practice) but im just so afraid. I have driven in my neighbourhood area alone but I don't dare driving out of it alone yet. I do know some people might be afraid....but there's actually not many family around me sometimes... I live with my mom and she drives but doesn't even want to sit in my car even in my neighbourhood area.

&#x200B;

1. yes I only drive when its not busy (so only when everyone is in school and all the people have gone to work) and before nightfall.
2. how do you stop being nervous/anxious? I feel my whole body tense. when im alone, I have a podcast on...sometimes I have to turn it off cause im just so overwhelmed.

4a.  this. I would tell my self im gonna drive one whole week straight, but then after 2 days I stop and continue after like a week have passes. I stop  because when something goes bad like I turn wrongly or I just feel like my driving is not smooth, I get stressed and panic and stop. I know this is dumb,i should be doing it daily so I can drive better but ......

its not just driving straight, its also parking, I feel everyone would laugh at me, cause how I much try, I tend to get my car in the middle of two parking spaces (box). this is the par that my family member seemed very frustrated...

im so jealous of others I know who just immediately is better at driving even before getting actual driving classes.

&#x200B;

7. I would love to get a refresher course! that would be a dream. but the place I live doesn't do such thing. I know other countries where my friend lives, they have these kind of classes.

but I did send a message to an instructor who taught me and  is part of the driving school (that I went to)....hoping he maybe would do a private class... but not sure yet cause he works like 5 or 7 days a week at that school. and that school doesn't do this kind of refresher course.

&#x200B;

I do hope one day I can actually post a good new saying that I can drive amazing. I really hope...

&#x200B;
