Since I'm going back to have it ""officially"" ruled out, I have yet again read up and watched countless hours of videos to do with females with ""high functioning"" autism out of sheer desperation to prove how wrong it is.

The most important things that sets autistic people apart from other disorders and difficulties anyone can experience, is their chronic/born with way of how they process physical and social information.

 Like dealing with sounds and tactile sensations and ""knowing"" unwritten or unspoken social norms and expectations.

When I read what you write, I clearly see that you're highly empathetic and adaptable to other people's circumstances. 

That's a huge strength, and I can absolutely understand why you connect with your friends, but having certain friends doesn't alone prove or indicate something as deeply integral as a neuropsychiatric disorder.

My advice going forward, for what it's worth, is to really reflect and focus on the most specific and serious criteria of being on the spectrum.

Otherwise, you'll just be ticking off personality traits.

There are many lists online, but I really recommend this site, because it has multiple very detailed tests:

https://aspietests.org/

You'll have to make an account unfortunately, but it's very useful to track what results you've had :)


Anyway, here's some questions I think would be a good place to start;

⚫Do you struggle with interpreting social cues, like when it's your turn to talk or if the other person is bored? 

⚫Do you struggle to understand facial expressions intuitively?

⚫Do you experience break downs or long periods of being ""burned out"" when you're overwhelmed or stressed for too long?

⚫Do you need to recover from social events?

⚫Do you find comfort in doing repetitive things, and did you enjoy it as a child as well?

⚫Do you struggle with eye contact? Does it take energy or effort to hold eye contact?

⚫Did you have special interests BEFORE being a teen? Was it obsessive in nature or unusually important to you that you're allowed to pursue it?

⚫Do you often tend to emotionally connect to inanimate objects?

If you answered yes to most of them, then I would agree that pursuing a diagnosis might be worth doing."

I just don't think giving them ammunition like this is a solution. I really think we should just ignore them, try not to sink to their level, you know?"
toastme,fluoedf,t3_fr7mqw,1585506694.0,"Sorry if this is creeping, but I got curious with your title!

I can absolutely relate to at least that one thing you went through. I recently got torn down and fired for talking too loud with another employee when the boss heard. I ended up crying and running home. I just couldn't help it, and perhaps neither could you. 

So I just want to say I understand at least that thing. 

People sometimes beat on people who are already down, and I think you were wise and strong to step away when it became too much!

I really hope you find the strength to keep looking for work. I can tell you want to do a good job, it just takes someone to realise that, and hopefully work with you to make it work :)"

My room is pretty wrecked too, but I got a trash bag and started to clean a little bit at a time, filling it with old stuff I find as I clean. 

There's no point in pushing yourself to clean everything in one go. Do it at your pace, a little is better than nothing :)"

mentalhealth,flu46nd,t3_fr65cn,1585494830.0,"I think one important thing to realise and accept is that what your feeling right now is not the real you. You clearly recognise that you didn't use to be this way.

It's an illness that you're fighting, and you're strong for doing it.

Keep fighting it. Don't let it or others win by seeing you give up."
mentalhealth,flu3wnf,t3_fr57i3,1585494651.0,"I hear you.

Are you sure it's not worth calling friend or family, maybe to check up on them as as an excuse, just to hear their voices and focus on something else for bit? Maybe it could help ground you?

Feeling baseless dread and depression at the drop of a hat is beyond draining, man. You're incredibly strong for fighting it right now."
dysthymia,flszl64,t1_fls7hpx,1585454949.0,"I'm so sorry to hear that. I was suicidal at 11 because of a medical issue, can't even imagine how hard it must've been for you.

I guess I was at least lucky to avoid ADHD misdiagnosis. And I'm glad you avoided being branded with something like that when it didn't fit. 


My deep attention and energy problems were always dismissed as simple teenage angst/depression because I could perform well in school, but afterwards I would be too exhausted to do anything but rest.


Also, I'm female, and there are many stereotypes around ADHD in particular. I still feel like I got the worst one out of the two, since they're both tested for at the same clinics.

How do you even disprove shit like this when no one is listening, you know? :(

Thank you so much for taking the time to reply to me!

 I realise my vent barely had anything to do with dysthymia, but autism subreddits want nothing to do with people who are looking for advice. Complete bullshit I you ask me."
dysthymia,flqm17l,t3_fkmzof,1585399692.0,"The best medication, is to try and be kind to yourself.

You fight something every day that others can't even comprehend dealing with. Take time to rest and don't push yourself to be strong when your weak. 

Athletes know when to rest, and so must we.

Please stay strong and please please do your best to not give in to self-harm urges. It doesn't solve problems, it makes them fester and get worse in my experience and makes me wallow in them.

I really hope this sub can be there for you when you need it. <3"
RBI,flq76xg,t3_fq4b1r,1585381977.0,"""Function & Advantages
Stop excessive, noisy dog barking by emitting an ultrasonic sound to silence the dog. More effective than old version deterrents and waterproof.""

Sounds like your neighbor is trying to get the neighborhood dogs to shut up using a safe noise maker to discipline and discourage barking. 

The barking isn't coming from an anti-barking device. He's trying to put a stop to it.

Maybe take it up with your fellow dog owners so the poor man doesn't have to get desperate enough to discipline your dogs for you?

Or maybe he should just start playing loud music at random intervals. Sounds like you want a free for all when it comes to noise pollution."

There are some predatory lesbians/political feminists just like there are predatory anything else. 

Your counter point was it hasn't happened to you. And that you believe hetero women are more likely to ""hurt"" Lesbians. Whatever that means.

Have you seen the abuse statistics among Lesbians? They hurt eachother more than any other group. 

They're not soft innocent butterflies who can do no wrong. They're people.

At this point you're rambling worse than someone experiencing some kind of mental episode, and I honestly don't care about what you're even trying to say anymore.

Sorry.

Besides being beautiful wild animals, they also sound absolutely ridiculous. [the snoring fox](https://youtu.be/sceMbHDvs3U)

Of course, they can cause a lot of trouble for themselves in an urban setting, but man are they cute. Definitely my second favourite animal after cats."

Rose is painfully unattractive. That awful hair and frumpy clothing does her no favours.

Seeing the actress on the red carpet after having seen her in the film, was like seeing an actual miracle happen.

How the Frick did the manage to make her look that frumpy in the film when she looks normal even cute in normal life??

Hair cuts and clothes are everything."
