Empaths,fo9v7ld,t1_fo8vvfl,1587632350.0,"I do think I am absorbing a few traits of my partner that I wouldn‚Äôt recognize as my own. 
Like how I perceive myself to be is completely different now from my actions and what not. It could also be a possibility that my insecurities are resurfacing and my partner also shares those with me. 

Like I see myself (people around me can agree) as a very spontaneous and outspoken person. But with my partner I‚Äôm the opposite. I can be very outgoing and go through my own motion with things and draw people in, but with my partner I seem to have retracted a little and lost my own ‚Äúflame‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs almost like I‚Äôve absorbed the fear that my partner has of not being good enough. (Although this is something a lot of people struggle with- I managed to show myself some love and accepting my own flaws. But with him it‚Äôs almost like they are all out). He is self critical- I have been as well. 

It‚Äôs just energy that I haven‚Äôt experienced in a while and now it‚Äôs coming back. I‚Äôm thinking it could be due to his energy....

Edit: it‚Äôs also possible my own perceptions of the person is somewhat above my own? I‚Äôm not sure if that makes sense."

dating_advice,f5kn6ko,t1_f5jigk8,1572266755.0,"It was definitely working it's way up to being serious. I guess now I can't help but feel played. Open relationship or not, he screwed a close friend of mine. He didn't even tell me about it after. Nor did he give me the choice/Chance to think about it. 

I understand the whole spur of the moment thing. And I'm glad I really took things slow because four months really is not enough to know someone and he already made it clear who he is. 

I can forgive him for this and I genuinely thought this could be a good thing for us, but I don't want to put anyone through a shitty spot because of his choice/action and my friends. The more I think about it the more fucked up it is. 

Maybe if this was with some rando, I'd feel less bad. But we hung days after he fucked my friend and he didn't even bring it up. He managed to show his face to my parents,  to me that's the biggest betrayal of all. 

I understand the fear in not being able to bring it up , but not telling me and not telling me sooner just messes things up. 

I guess I made up my mind and now I have to move on. Shit happens. I can only decide how I act and do things from now on. But just because it's shitty doesn't mean it's the end of the world or that I won't grow.

dysthymia,f58phcl,t1_f57l6xf,1572061070.0,"Hi, thank you for taking the time to write back. I have been diagnosed with dysthymia with the presence of mixed features. I'm 20 and female. 

A lot of the appearing to be normal has caused me to be a little more secretive with my coping mechanisms and how I truly feel. As a result, I think it may have caused to force me into feeling numb or fake, especially not being able to express myself without feeling either of the two. I'm also naturally very detached and indifferent to certain things/events in my life. 

The guilt I feel I guess could be linked to fear of abandonment but I also definitely don't want to burden other people based on how I am: indifferent and negative. I try my best to make sure I don't step on anyone feet or draw too much attention towards the things I might be going through. When I say opening up, I mean to say that there is guilt involved in opening up about, at the time, might be depressed. Now that I'm diagnosed, I feel guilty still for even feeling low and not have a valid reason or not being bad enough (I know I won't be taken too seriously. Perhaps I don't with others either). 

I feel guilty for making the moment about me, in a negative way. I'm practicing to express how I am proud of myself and the things I've done that pull me closer towards progress and what not, contrary to making things about myself, to me that is easier or less guilt filled when I try to ""humble brag"". Somehow it just feels less attention seeking. there are also other situations where I feel guilty as well... I just can't list them all down right now. 

Some days are more neutral than others, just going with the flow and not taking anything in too personally. Other days (mainly at night) it hits me that I have to go through another day, having to struggle to keep up- needing to be alone knowing I might just lose my cool and be irritable. Other times I've lost interest.. (insert other symptoms here).  There was a time that I'd be so standoffish in the morning, or when I'm irritable out of nowhere, sometimes it feel as though my body takes over auto pilot during conversation (for example) and the words that come out aren't my own and the expression that I'm trying to give out aren't truly mine. This makes me more confused as to how I truly feel. 

Mentioned earlier, I exhibit mixed symptoms. I'm convinced that I've experienced hypomania several times the last few years. More so the last 3. I get this overwhelming feeling of just loving life and being on top of the world. I'm more perceptive and empathetic. I feel as though I can be there for people emotionally and support them. I get a flight of thoughts and my mouth has a mind of its own (I won't stop talking. When I do catch myself I try to ask if I was talking too fast or rambling). Sometimes I even feel as though a nothing would make me cry or emotional. It feels like my body is on meth(wanting to run, exuberant, having an itch I can't scartch) It's exhausting. I'll spend the next few days sort of worn out. But also have more neutral either the good neutral or the low neutral."
dysthymia,f58nfb4,t1_f56qgze,1572059823.0,"I'll definitely try to apply 2 and 3 as I've already worked on 1 the past few months. I think a part of my problem too is that I become avoidant towards those who will try to listen because I'm not used to it? Like what if they just take a whole step back and realize that I can be a lot. (which sometimes send me to withdraw and isolate myself). I'm definite that I judge myself a little too hard too, and that leaks into judging others. It's my defense mechanism... I also noticed that once I lose my ""I'm going to try to look normal as much as possible"" sort of fades away the more I hang out with a person and that sends me through a cloud of guilt- I can't be there for them emotionally and I won't open up for them to try to ""help"" me (sometimes I feel like it's just criticism or condescending when they do try to help.

EatingDisorders,f3kza0e,t3_dgx49x,1570971039.0,"Before I tell that all your thoughts are pretty common in the ED community- I'd like to say that the fact that you recognize this behavior as disordered means that you are ready to face it and get in under control (and we can do that in small increments). 

1. Others have already said that by practice giving positivr thinking it can help you decrease your chances of spiraling down. (I cant offer much advice on this. I'd recommend creating another post to ask this very question). 

2. Food as a coping mechanism for traumas in your life. Id like to ask you if you have spoken about this outloud to people you trust. Would you be willing to go to therapy for this? I know it's scary, but I can't stress the fact that it will help. Do you have history of depression or other mental illness? 

3. I know it's very invalidating that your parents don't exactly see your habits as a problem.. yet... I think it's safe to assume that they don't necessarily Understand what you're going through mentally. You can bring it up one day, but for now you have to stay strong for yourself. You can do this by being a little more active and fight those urges to eat more than you need to. This is the hardest part! My psychiatrist suggested that when I recognize the urge I get up and distract myself from it - walk and or talk to people... You can again ask other people's thoughts and advice on this. 

4. When you have the urge to eat more than you have to... Try eating and snacking on fruits and vegetables. (this will also be a challenge, more on having access to this when you need it.


If you ever need to talk more about this, my inbox is open for you. I'll do my best to listen and offer support. You deserve to be happy and deserve to be recognized for the struggles you face in life."

Psychic,f3f0mgm,t1_f3ezvno,1570888050.0,"I will watch out for  emotional vampires of those sort. I do tend to avoid them, but I am worried that my energy still invites them in. Im not sure how well I protect myself from in, but I can only assume they also feel the ""click"" that I do."
AnorexiaNervosa,f3f0bok,t3_dgu4bt,1570887920.0,"I know what it's like to try to seek validation from a parent and not get it. It sucks and it hurts. You probably feel very defeated and worthless right now. I'm sorry you have such a cold and damp relationship with your mom in this regard. 
I do offer my heart out and let you know that you are worth so much more than just a number on a scale or measuring tape. I know it sucks to be reminded of how you ""should"" hate yourself, but please stay strong for yourself and keep fighting to be a better person than those who bring you down. It may not help you recover, I still hope it helps even in some other way."
