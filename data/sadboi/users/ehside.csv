Another trick I’ve learned is to buy bone in meat and freeze the bones. Often small batches of meat aren’t enough bones to make soup, but if you collect them over time you can make a big batch, and freeze what you’re not using right away. If you’re willing to do a little extra, it’s not hard to grow your own herbs and the plants will make your place nicer."

The problem was whenever I was around her family. She was super adamant that I have a good relationship with her family, which in itself is not a bad thing to want. However every time I was around them, anything I did was under intense scrutiny by her. If I was too quiet, or too awkward or respectfully disagreed with them I would get yelled at by her about how much I hated her family. I have an anxiety disorder, and I was even told I wasn’t allowed to be anxious around her family, which is pretty much impossible to guarantee. It was worse when they were occasionally rude to me, and if I tried to address it, she wouldn’t even give me the benefit of the doubt, because to her, her family was perfect, so I was being too sensitive there was something wrong with me. I just wanted to make her happy, but I felt like I couldn’t do anything right, and slowly started to believe that I actually was the horrible, socially inept person she kept telling me I was. 


It took me awhile to realize how messed up her treatment of me was on that front. My awkward moments, my little social faux pas were totally normal, and happens to everyone. All it takes is a simple apology or explanation, and no mature adult is going to hold those things against you, and certainly not respond with the violent reactions she had. Every time I do something awkward nowadays, I still have that intense feeling of terror that I’m about to get reamed out for it, but it never comes because most people don’t expect you to be perfect. I have to constantly remind myself that it’s ok to make mistakes, and it’s ok to be human, as long as you continue to act with kindness and empathy."

Her comments that “I’m not going to get better” were completely unfounded. The thing I have in the back of my mind though, is that I always knew I was capable of doing those things anyways, with or without her.

I understand the idea of if you love someone let them go, and wanting them to be happy even without you. From what I know about her life, I know that despite what she would tell you, she’s not very happy with her life as it is. She has a bunch of issues with her relationship with her family, being stuck inside her comfort zone and lack of maturity and accountability to fix those issues. A big part of the reason she broke up with me is that we ended up in a situation that required her to confront those issues, but she chose to get rid of me instead of actually deal with the issues. I worry about her all the time. That her parents still don’t respect her, and that she still doesn’t have the courage to stand up for herself.

Futurology,fo1yh65,t1_fo1grnv,1587444592.0,"Multiple people required is for safety reasons. I’m guessing with the time it took, is that there is a minimum time requirement for a work call. It’s not fair to a worker to ask them to commute in for only a 10-20 min call, as it will cost them more in transportation costs than they will make. Not allowing you to do the work yourself is an important principal, because it takes work away from people, and it’s also a safety measure. You’re getting paid anyways no matter what, so if you’re counting yourself as labour, which you’re not, it’s an excuse to not pay someone else. The more people try and get away with this, it leads to an understaffed team that is being expected to do the work of many more people, which often leads to unsafe situations. Union contracts are very rarely arbitrary. Everything is there for a good reason."
Futurology,fo1xhjq,t1_fo16so1,1587443846.0,"Yep. It’s pretty insane.

The craziest example I’ve seen is a guy who is very vocally anti-union, even though his wife is a union teacher, and she earns the majority of the family income."

You probably already know about Ramen and pho, but I’ll suggest trying Taiwanese beef noodle soup, and boat noodles aka the best soup you’ve never tried!"
GranblueFantasyVersus,fnmfeei,t3_g23gd9,1587070440.0,"I’m having trouble transitioning from facing AI to human opponents. I can do well against the hardest AI’s but still get crushed online. I can put pressure on the AI from the start of a round, but feel like I’m on always on the back foot from the start of an online match. I’m playing Lancelot, and given his move set, I feel like I need to be the one on offense. Another problem I have is knowing when to transition from offense to defense and vice versa.

Thanks!"
baseball,fnm370x,t1_fnjqrzl,1587064299.0,"Me too. Most of the most memorable ball parks are because of the quirks and imperfections of integrating them into their environment. Kauffman is the opposite, where every element is intentionally designed, and is seamless in a way that most ballparks aren’t. It’s an outstanding representation of the architectural style of the time."

worldnews,fneolac,t1_fndwclp,1586893071.0,"Yeah, that’s not really the lesson to take away from this. Being a non profit or being paid by the hour has nothing to do with it, you just had bad management. There are fantastic organizations that have both of those criteria."
