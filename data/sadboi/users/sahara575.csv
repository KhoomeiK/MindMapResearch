reactivedogs,f7ht769,t3_dw3v4h,1573747023.0,Our girl is a pitbull mix. She is a rescue and we’ve had her since May. Slowly making improvements. And of course with her being a pitbull everyone is terrified of her. But she’s the sweetest baby at home and deserves lots of love.
rarepuppers,f774lj8,t3_dulax0,1573443814.0,This is our dog Ellie. She is the sweetest pupper and a massive cuddle bug. We were told when we adopted her that she was a pitbull German Shepard mix but we are not so sure. We love her regardless!
abbotsford,f6swf1q,t3_dste99,1573140702.0,I can recommend a couple local breweries too. Field house is great in the summer. Busy but great. And loudmouth is my favourite place right now. Nice atmosphere and the burgers and fries are amazing. It’s run by a husband and wife team and they are great people. Welcome to Abbotsford!

dogswithjobs,f6pdiqo,t1_f6o6cb6,1573053895.0,Thank you I’ll look into all of this. Hope it helps
dogswithjobs,f6o3vz7,t1_f6o35bg,1573007088.0,Any tips your son can give? We are dealing with exactly this situation at the moment with our dog.
trashy,f0l6z03,t1_f0kge9a,1568701514.0,Because it’s just that easy
bulimia,eyzcwmn,t1_eyz6o4c,1567614870.0,No worries. Yeah give it a try because I did feel heathy when I was on it. Good luck :)
bulimia,eyz6dd0,t3_czlzl9,1567610608.0,"Hey, I went keto for about a year and I am now low carb. When I was keto I felt amazing and heathy and did not have binges. I had a healthier mindset.

 Now that I am just low carb I find I have been bingeing a lot. I try to eat low carb 5 or 6 days a weeks and the other days unfortunately just turn into binge days. I need to make some changes obviously."
abbotsford,erk2hzv,t3_c2cv2h,1560953719.0,I have freedom and I haven’t had a problem so far. We haven’t gone out further than Sumas but within those limits the service is good.
EatingDisorders,ep567nf,t3_bts0ve,1559051141.0,I do find that weightlifting has been helpful for me and I get into a healthier mindset. I can tell myself I want strong not thin. But then if I don’t go to the gym I beat myself up about it. There is no magic cure for an eating disorder.
