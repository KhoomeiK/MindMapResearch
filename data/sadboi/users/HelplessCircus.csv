Divorce_Men,eshwvdo,t1_eshwbqb,1562002527.0,"That‚Äôs probably true. I‚Äôm more thinking of my Ex needing to provide receipts showing that the money was actually used for the benefit of the children.

I‚Äôm pretty biased when it comes to this topic. Because I have done well for myself in life I get penalized so that my EX has the same financial opportunity to provide for the kids."
Divorce_Men,eshw6m5,t1_eshtzr2,1562002156.0,"I might be ok with it if it was out of my pretax dollars but it‚Äôs not. I pay the taxes on the child support money AND I pay the 3% fee. 

Also, if I had a say in what that money was used for I also might be able to overlook getting bent over by the system."
Divorce_Men,eshrpfb,t3_c7sd11,1561999717.0,Here in Minnesota I have to pay a 3% of whatever the total dollar amount is for child support owed each month. That fee goes to the state to take it directly out of my paycheck each pay period. It is a small amount but It really grinds my ass to think that I have to pay a fee to give my money away.....

tattoos,esathio,t3_c6qdnu,1561768358.0,If I hadn‚Äôt said what it was it would have taken you a bit longer to tell what it was. Having nice crisp edges helps i think. Seth did a nice job on it.
Divorce,esagrz3,t1_esa3c61,1561759249.0,Anytime! Best of luck to you
Divorce,es9v8h1,t3_c6n8eq,1561745297.0,"When I went through my divorce my paperwork stated what happened with the QDRO. My Ex had to work with both her attorney and a QDRO attorney to get that process going ( She has so little retirement that I after 50/50 split I still had to give 40% in order to balance it out, FML)

If your paperwork doesn‚Äôt state anything I‚Äôd get in touch with an attorney who specializes in QDRO. They figure out how everything is split from the retirement accounts.

Hope this helps."
Divorce_Men,es1778s,t3_c5be8x,1561490607.0,"Have you discussed any of this with her?? If she is 12 years younger she may be just going through a different stage of life for whatever reasons. However, it doesn‚Äôt sound like she is motivated to succeed in life by working so little hours and not pursuing a career to utilize her education. At least you have things secured financially if you should decide to separate. 

Do you think it feels like a job because she isn‚Äôt financially pulling her weight? 

At this point I think you have to decide if you love her and that the love is strong enough to work through discussing it and making changes. Beat of luck my friend!"
AskReddit,erwdnd9,t3_c44wjk,1561340543.0,"Not sure if this was shared yet or not but what pisses me off most is some people‚Äôs complete disregard of the others around them but specifically behind them. For example, walking down the isle of your nearest big box store and some asshole in front of you just stops with there cart and blocks the isle seemingly for no good reason and leaves the cart right in the way. Meanwhile they are oblivious to the fact that no one else can get by with out physically moving their shit out of the way!!! This same thing applies to people driving in the left lane of the interstate COMPLETELY fucking up the flow of traffic because they don‚Äôt want to follow the semi, but are scared to pass it. 

This feeling brings me back to high school when you‚Äôd be walking down the hall and the the people in front of you would decide it‚Äôs a good time to all suddenly stop and have a group huddle. Meanwhile they cause a god damn traffic jam because everyone would have to go around and walk into oncoming pedestrian traffic just to get by.

Not sure if others feel the same way but this kind of shit grinds my ass every time!!!! 

Cheers everyone!"

Divorce,erg6fyt,t1_erg1wug,1560827853.0,"Yep it was a big life lesson. My kids are 13, 11, 10, so they don‚Äôt know everything that happened. They will some day and then they will be able to make that choice. Until then. I work on being the best Dad I can be!"
Divorce,erfrd6z,t3_c1u5j0,1560815850.0,"When my ex asked for a divorce, I had been through three affairs with her (she cheated). I knew at that point enough is enough and was ready to move on. The threshold of when a person has accepted calling it quits is different for everyone. Ask yourself ‚ÄúAm I happy?‚Äù ‚ÄúAm I willing to stay if I‚Äôm not happy?‚Äù 

Remember you are important too! Put yourself first."
