SuicideWatch,fqbwhgo,t3_ghy4rb,1589245291.0,Mid 30s. Coronavirus might be the thing that finally pushes me over the edge. I'm forced to live away from the person I love most in the world because we're from different countries. We had planned to marry in spring but that isn't happening. I haven't lived in my own country for almost 2years so being back means being stuck at home with no friends and facing the harsh reality I that I may never see the person I love most again. I hate my life. There is no point in me getting up every day. Meanwhile on social media I get bombarded by all my happy couple friends who are having babies. I literally have no reason to exist. I'm expendable.

AskReddit,fpzwpmt,t1_fpzb6bt,1589024808.0,"My second bout with mania was really weird because there was a part of brain that knew it was mania but I was too scared to tell anyone because I was also feeling weirdly paranoid so I went away to a hotel for a weekend and took a couple sleeping pills each night, leaving myself notes about what dosage I had taken and what time and day (because as you know, days of the week are not a thing you can differentiate). After 3 days of that and a lot of sleep, I felt okay again. In hindsight it was really dangerous, so won't be doing that again. But it also worked in a weird ""have you tried turning it off and on again"" kind of way. Thanks brain. You fucking weirdo."

My first few nights alone in my new place, I didn't sleep and I kept panicking about not having a return ticket home. Once I got past those first few nights, the excitement of exploring a new city took over, I started making new friends, and the fear quickly went away. 

I didn't go home for about 8 months, but when I did I had an amazing visit with family and friends. I don't regret anything. I think moving away really changed my perspective on the world."
