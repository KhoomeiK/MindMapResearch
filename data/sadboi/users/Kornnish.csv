malaysia,fomkl3l,t1_fomffs0,1587893538.0,I don't think it's Malaysians that are the problem. It's because we're all stuck in this economy that focuses on exponential growth and consumption. When you're so busy working to survive what time do you have left to yourself or even to think about doing anything for the environment?
