CricketWireless,esbaos4,t1_esauoim,1561783935.0,Ok thank you! Just wanted to know in gerneral if itâ€™s something am suppose to get or not please? If you normally use it pdanet without the the 10g let me know please and Iâ€™ll call and remove it today. Thank u sorry for multiple response
CricketWireless,esat79r,t1_esaa0l6,1561768119.0,Thank you for responding!!  I donâ€™t think I asked the question correctly. I wanted to know if I still needed to get the 10g hotspot. For faster internet. My internet was crazy slow when I use pdanet to connect to my iPad or tv. So I was wondering if it would make a difference if I upgraded and got the 10g. I actually just upgraded about 10 mins ago and I still canâ€™t tell the difference in speed. So am not sure if I should downgrade again. People are saying they have really fast speed using pdanet just wondering if am doing something wrong. Also I saw that am suppose to turn on hide  tether usage oh. But I Checked my cricket account and they can see how much I have used already .. please most important question for me is do I need to get the 10g hotspot to have faster internet with pdanet of is my regular unlimited plan ok

CricketWireless,es3zcz5,t3_c1pd1k,1561573822.0,Hey guys so currently I am using cricket and I have unlimited high speed data but no data or tethering with the plan with the plan. I went to upgrade to 10g tethering data for faster network cause itâ€™s kinda slow. But I wanted to know if I get the 10g will I be able to use it without it finishing the 10g . Will I have unlimited data  with pdanet still or will it run out ? I have been looking online with no luck on this answer
