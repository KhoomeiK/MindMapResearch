philosophy,eqsijje,t3_bz1nun,1560285686.0,"Hi I’ve posted here before, was hoping to get more feedback on a thought I had. If prventinng aspects of freedom of speech is based in trying to avoid the masses from being influenced into faulty action, and we know this is could happen, doesn’t that mean we think people in general don’t really have a choice in taking on faulty action? If humanity hearing a faulty idea is going to result in their compromise, how can we hope to survive?"

philosophy,eqim38v,t3_bwecee,1560089501.0,"Hey guys! Fairly new to philosophy, (22 year old not particularly well read but I’ve seen a ton of movies and I’m finding my place in the world so I’m interested), but I have a question about my thoughts on Socrates quote “the only thing I know is that I know nothing”. I made sense of it in the way that the universe is constantly moving, so it’s all technically one big blur, and therefore it’s abstract and undefinable in an objective way, like everything within it, including people! So the way I see it the only thing I know about my self is that I know nothing, it’s all subjective guesses, posing as objectivity. There can’t be any constants in a universe that’s always going. Am I on the right track here? Please use layman’s terms if ya can."
