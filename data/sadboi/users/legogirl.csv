That you didn’t go to college is obvious. Not because your intelligence is in question, but you lack the knowledge for how to make a real point or argument. And somehow you don’t see the point in college. 

For example, comparing anyone to trump based on college degree is bad logic. The question should be is trump better for going to college and does society benefit from that alone. It has nothing to do with politics and it’s completely irrelevant. 

If you’d like to learn how to make logical arguments, there are a ton of articles and guides. Just google “logical fallacies.”  You’ll be much more successful at making your point without just starting flame wars. College isn’t required to be knowledgeable or intelligent. That wasn’t the original point though.  You’ve latched onto a red herring. That’s why you’re feeling like people aren’t addressing your “point” - you got a little off track.
