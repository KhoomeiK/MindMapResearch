AskReddit,f8bi7fi,t1_f8bctvt,1574437482.0,"Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are a widely used type of antidepressant.

They're mainly prescribed to treat depression, particularly persistent or severe cases, and are often used in combination with a talking therapy such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

SSRIs are usually the first choice medication for depression because they generally have fewer side effects than most other types of antidepressant.

As well as depression, SSRIs can be used to treat a number of other mental health conditions, including:


generalised anxiety disorder (GAD)

obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)

panic disorder

severe phobias, such as agoraphobia and social phobia

bulimia

post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
