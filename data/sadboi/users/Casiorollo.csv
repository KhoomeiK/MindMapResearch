Sometimes I joke with other people that the ones on my knees are from a hardcore motorcycle accident. I think the facial ones are the most beautiful, and the best part about them is that they can’t hurt you in almost any way. I used to hate mine, but then I thought, why though? They don’t hurt me, they really aren’t ugly at all, and a lot of people I meet think they are cool. I say flaunt those spots! 
  
I mean, it’s like a Dalmatian wishing that it was all white and all black, but we have tons of dogs that are all white and all black. Dalmatians are worth a lot because of all those spots. I’m not saying you’re a dog, but the sentiment is the same. You are unique! In a way that a lot of people aren’t! Most people are interested in and really like your spots, and think they are cool. No one, not even other people with vitiligo, have the same spots you do. They are like snowflakes, each one unique. I like to try and see what shape each one is. I once had a smiley-face spot that I absolutely adored. So why try to hide or hate what makes your special?

Right after the accident I immediately knew it was broken, as it hurt and was sticking out at a freaky angle, and clenched my hand into a fist twice to try and move it back in place, and that was the last time I ever closed my hand fully into a fist. Moral of the story? Get a voice activated navigation attachment for your helmet and pay attention to the road at all times on a motorcycle.

I once was a passenger in my own car coming back home down a 40 mile stretch of highway.

The melting snow had frozen into black ice, and being no cars in front of us we were the first on the highway to hit it. I had been looking out the passenger side window at the time and we slid so far sideways that I was no longer looking at the sidewall, but straight down the highway. 
  
We managed to regain control(4 wheel drive) before the black ice patch ended, but that was the most terrifying thing I've ever experienced. Had we hit the end before we straightened, we would have gone into a full barrel-roll at 75 mph. That car did have a very sturdy frame on it, but I shudder to think of the injuries(or deaths) we would have had.

My to do list includes buying a ball for my tennis racket so I can exercise, cleaning my room, doing some coding, and then finally spending a decent amount of time looking for a job.
