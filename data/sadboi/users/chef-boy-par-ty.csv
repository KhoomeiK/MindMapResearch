Stability is key ailing with balance -- not the dramatic fluctuations to even things out. I know self-sabotage all too well. In my case, I had an extremely poor sense of self-worth; thus, I would attain delightful experiences and friends and obtain material things, etc. mostly to feel my inner-void; yet, I knew subconsciously and instinctively that around the corner and at any given moment I was set to destroy all of which I had nurtured and amassed in a fit of projecting my inner-hatred and unleashing and weaponizing it to inflict the most powerful injury that I could to those closest to me and even strangers as twisted and distorted cathartic expression."
