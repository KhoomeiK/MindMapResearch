This really messed up the relationship between my mother and I because we both remember my childhood differently. I believed she could have done something about my Dad and she believes my upbringing was entirely normal.

Then... bipolar diagnosis and I mistakenly told her. The first words out of her mouth are constantly ""Are you taking your medication?"" to any problem I might have. Bill late? Have you taken your medication? This might sound appropriate given the diagnoses - but I know that she's asking out of malice & spite: she hated the idea of me taking any medication at all and refused to get me treated for anything less than life-threatening injuries. 

I once broke my ankle in school and could barely walk on it... yet I was forced to continue and told to stop exaggerating. I can still remember the pain. Fifteen years later, I'm getting physical therapy because my ankle *did* break and it healed badly. She believes (just like you u/anxiousnugget) that I was simply attention-seeking and that I had fooled myself, the psychiatrists, doctors and nurses, etc into believing in an illness I don't have.

I have done this to myself so many times and - guess what - it really doesn't help you out. Getting the diagnosis took ten years for me and right at the very beginning I can remember telling my first psychiatrist that I thought I was bipolar. I had the evidence in my head and how I felt, but that was not enough.

As well as tracking your moods throughout a day you can 'tag' activities that you've done too. It really is simple and effective. For me (everyone is different), I found creating the following activities pretty useful for tracking Bipolar:

* ""AM Medication"" / ""PM Medication"" if you frequently forget. Daylio makes it easy for you to see days you have missed so you can talk about this with your support.
* ""External Red Flag"" is when someone else warns you about your behaviour. This is important to use - even if you don't understand the warning/bad behaviour. 
* ""Possible Trigger"" is for anything from a difficult therapy session to learning about someone's death. These come in handy when you're seeing a Crisis Team.
