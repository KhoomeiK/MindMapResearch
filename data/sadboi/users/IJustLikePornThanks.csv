EatingDisorders,eujjauy,t3_cglphq,1563872556.0,"When I was very sick, I would try to eat by eating the things I liked the most. Food I didn't want or like would ""grow"" so much in my mouth that I felt like I was being choked. So I could either try to swallow while crying... Or spit it out. I usually swallowed it though. 

Raw or cooked veggies were easier to eat (and good for my stomach), and if I had a very bad day I would buy smoothies or drinking yoghurts because they're easier to get down because I didn't have to chew. Also, chips and snacks are easy because you can just eat one or two, you don't have to finish everything at once :) 

Also, eating just tiny amounts all day, helped me get used to the feeling of my stomach expanding, which has been very hard for me, because all the starving has made me forget how it feels when you're full vs. hungry. I couldn't tell the difference in the end.

Edit: I also tried to think of food as nourishment. As in, I NEED to eat to stay strong, gain muscle, look beautiful. I NEED to eat to be able to have energy for friends and work. I NEED to eat for my own well-being and for having beautiful skin, hair, nails so I can feel confident :)
Food is survival. Even if you don't like eating it. It takes time, so just take one step at a time.."

badwomensanatomy,etefwu9,t3_cb1yx8,1562731585.0,"It's actually not a joke. Heavy metals (from fish) , pesticides and hormone disrupting things (like the plastic in shirts with print, soft plastics, etc. Akkumulate in our bodies and take a loooong time for the body to get rid of. What happens to men is that it just stays in their bodies. For women it actually does mean that the mother gives those 'toxins' or whatever you'd like to call it to their fetus/baby, thus the baby will be born with heavy metals and hormone disruptive drugs already in their bodies. And also some of it will come out with the breast milk. 

So even though he's stupid and a jackass, that one thing wasn't wrong.

If you Google: ""Hormone disrupting chemicals pregnant women"" or ""hormone disrupting chemicals birth defects"" there are so many good studies proving it."
