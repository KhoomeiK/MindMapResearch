everyday routine. It was a daily grind. It made me happy. And kept me going through hard times.
Then I went to college. I couldn't play or make videos. I got really depressed and lonely. I'm from India so, no-one cares about a gamer nerd here. I was a fading soul.
I am a alcoholic and chainsmoker now. Life's real messed up. I've crippling anxiety and depression. Am still waiting for those days to return. The ultimate comeback. Still hanging on. 

P.S the anxiety and depression is not because of gaming. It's cuz of my degree. I wanted to major in fine arts. But I'm unfortunately doing engineering. So there's that!
Also forgive my English, it's not my first language."

Anxiety,et5t3e2,t3_ca25kb,1562488401.0,"That is true my friend. You cannot do anyone any wrong while having anxiety. You'll be regretting even the smallest of mistakes till your very demise. 
Think of it this way. We humans are feeble creatures by nature. We stumble and bump into things as we move forward. And sometimes you get bruised or hurt. And the scar may stay with you forever. But that's how you grow. That bump is a lesson. 
I know having anxiety is awful. I have it myself. But try to look at it in a positive way. 
""Hmmmm so I can't make mistakes! Okay I'll try to be the nicest person ever"" I mean what else can you do?
And ask people what the actual fuck are they expecting from you.
Mom: Turn the gas down
You: Exactly how much lower do you want it turned down mother (politely)
Mom: ____ That much lower

(Problem solved)
  
Avoid making mistakes by simply thinking about it. If you're not sure about something. Seek for guidance, seek for help. One can only do so little on their own. 

And lastly be positive. 

Also my English is very bad. And I never know what I'm saying. So I'm not sure if this even makes sense to any of you. But it does to me tho. So I'm really happy about it :)"
