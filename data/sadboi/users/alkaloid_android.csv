linux4noobs,fpaiii4,t1_fpa2r3l,1588448879.0,"You can override permissions issues with a super user account. The most common way to do this is with the `sudo` command. Be careful using the root account (which is what happens when you use `sudo`) as you can break things, there are no guards against shooting yourself in the foot with the root account.

For your particular problem (changing the theme), open the terminal and run the following command:

`sudo cp /path/to/theme /usr/share/themes/`

There are a couple things going on here. `sudo` stands for ""Super User DO"". It will prompt you for your credentials and then move on to the second command. `cp` or copy, takes the file from the first argument and copies it to the location in the second argument. In this case, copying `/path/to/theme` into `/usr/share/themes/`.

If you're struggling with the command line (which I highly recommend learning, it will save you lots of trouble), there are plenty of resources to help you learn. I'll link a couple of them below.

Unfortunately I can't find the article, but there was an example of a guy who had his leg amputated for unrelated reasons, and saved it to be eaten. 

Plants have not been proven to have brains or feel pain, nor have they been proven to have sentience. Besides, we have to eat _something_, and if you're really concerned about pain caused to plants, think of how many plants are eaten by your food before it reaches your plate. This is called [Feed Conversion Ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feed_conversion_ratio) or FCR. Beef has a 4.5-7.5 FCR, or 4.5/7.5lbs of feed per 1lb of meat.

DebateAVegan,fo4itql,t1_fo2ulrr,1587505201.0,"This is a very interesting line of thought that approaches political discussion (but then again, ethical veganism is itself political activism). I would agree that any surplus value extracted from human labor would be considered egregious in Marx's eyes, but when it comes to what we can do about it (without seizing the means of production) we have to be a little more practical. After all, veganism is the reduction of harm done to sentient beings as much as possible within the realms of what one can do themselves. 

I wouldn't argue against a person with low income purchasing goods manufactured in a sweatshop if the alternative was they were to go unclothed during the winter. Neither would I argue such a person go hungry because they cannot afford fair-trade products. Harm reduction and nonviolence when it comes to veganism state that you can only go as far as possible for your situation. 

I guess that the main point I'm trying to make is that humans are also animals. Not all of us have the means to support ethically-sourced products, but all who can have a moral obligation to do so.

My point is that animal exploitation is visible, whereas people go to great lengths to make sure you don't see the man behind the curtain when it comes to the exploitation of human labor. We should be doing our best to avoid creating demand for either product.

Really, the choice between the two of them comes down to preference. I would suggest spinning up a few virtual machines and trying them both out, seeing which DE you like, and playing around in them. Decide which DE you like, and go from there"
schizophrenia,fj4g6rd,t3_fbcp42,1583007512.0,"I don't get traditional voices, more like delusions related to what people around me say. Everyone is talking about me, and I'm somehow the center of every conversation I overhear, everything I read, or whatever I'm watching on television. The delusions of grandeur get worse and worse as I become more and more psychotic, and eventually end up with me harming or attempting to harm myself to escape this reality, which is all an illusion. It gets pretty intense. One caveat of these delusions is that whenever someone speaks well of anyone within earshot, I believe they're talking about me and get the warm and fuzzy feelings. When they're putting someone down or talking negatively about someone, the opposite happens and I feel worthless.

I've had a number of religious delusions, including seeing, hearing, and feeling my guardian angel. I'm generally agnostic, but this sort of thing was so real I had no choice than to believe in the supernatural. I also saw demons swirling around people, or places. This was (as you might imagine) very disturbing and unsettling. 

As far as dealing with people who have schizophrenia or other related disorders (I have schizoaffective bipolar type disorder), the best thing you can do for them is to stay positive, don't reinforce their delusions or voices, and be a calming presence in the life of someone who is frightened and delusional. Sometimes I get the idea that everyone (no matter how helpful) is only superficially kind to me, and that they have another agenda. The most helpful experience I had on a psych ward was a nurse who sat down with me and talked to me like I was a person. She asked me what I was experiencing, and spoke to me just like anyone else. Don't be afraid of people with psychotic disorders, they are more likely to hurt themselves out of confusion or delusion, rather than hurting others. 

I hope this helps! Just by asking these questions you have started down the right path to becoming a healing influence in the lives of people who are often demonized and misunderstood."

FindMeADistro,fiye35j,t3_faherw,1582837631.0,"Arch is a step up on the skill ladder compared to Fedora. Everything done in the installation steps is through bash, the command line. If you're not comfortable in the command line interface, I would not suggest attempting to install Arch as your second Linux distro. Although the manual is good, and I often reference it for other distros, the installation process can be interesting. You might install in a few hours, it might take a few days, it really depends on your hardware and skill level.

Ubuntu and Debian are both really stable, easy to use, and hard to break. Ubuntu also has several different sub-distros (such as Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Xubuntu) that come with different desktop environments installed. Ubuntu is a Debian derivative, so you get the packages and stability of Debian with a few tools extra, like the proprietary driver installation tool. 

I'm not trying to push you in any particular direction, but I would suggest you do a little more research before you decide. Pretty much any choice you make has pros and cons, with Arch you will learn more, but also break things more. With Debian/Ubuntu, you will get a stable system with delayed updates. It's all about trade-offs."
FindMeADistro,fiqi9im,t1_fiqg8hm,1582644895.0,"As long as it's a USB 3.0/3.1 device, it should be fast enough for your needs. Either way, it will still be slower than if it was installed to the internal SSD, so don't expect screaming performance. 

For persistence, you can use a smaller flash drive with Ubuntu (or any distro really) and install it to a second flash drive. I would suggest disconnecting your internal SSD so you don't accidentally blow it away. 64GB + should be plenty, but you could get away with a 32GB flash drive. I use a 16GB drive for a recovery disk, but I don't keep any files on it. 

As far as difference between a flash drive and an external ssd, as long as the flash drive is fast enough to saturate the USB connection, there will be little to no difference (unless you're using eSATA for the external SSD, which would be quite a bit faster). I would shop around for a flash drive with good bandwidth, you may want to look a the specs of your usb connection to make this as informed of a choice as you can."
learnpython,fifd5pc,t3_f7klos,1582388630.0,"Programming isn't all about math. It helps to understand boolean logic, but the level that is required to do most tasks isn't that advanced. It's all if this than that, if not this than that, etc. Python is one of the most approachable programming languages, and works very much like a written language such as English. If you can logically structure what you want the computer to do in English, you can do it in python. The one thing that catches people up the most is that you have to tell the computer exactly what to do, it does not interpret intent. Being able to design flow-charts is very helpful, and will go a long way in learning how to structure your program. 

Most of all, practice, practice, practice! And break big problems into smaller chunks. If you can take a complicated task and break it down into simpler sub-tasks, you should be well on your way to learning how to break down a program and write it in small logical chunks (called functions). 

Don't give up! We all find error codes, run into bugs and difficulties breaking down tasks into less complicated sub-tasks. Once you have some practice, it will all come together. It's not about rote memorization, we have this wonderful thing called the internet for that. I find myself looking up even simple tasks frequently, don't feel bad if you can't write everything off the cuff!"

Anything that you can't find in their respective documentation portals can be found over at the [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org). 

If you find setting up a new install tedious (I certainly do), document your whole install process and write a shell script to automate it. That way, you only have to do everything once. I do this, and when I decide to perform a fresh install, all I do is install the base system and run my setup script.

linuxquestions,fgc4sii,t3_exjmwo,1580669101.0,"Like others have said, it takes practice. My suggestion, learn some of the common commands and programs that you will use. Some examples:
`cat`, `grep`, `apt`, `vim`, `htop`, `less`, `man`, `find`.

Once you get comfortable using these commands, (especially `man`) the rest is reading and searching for manuals with `man`, finding configuration files with `find`, editing them with `vim`, and searching for text with `grep`. Once you have a good base, everything else falls into place as you use your system. 

If you're on systemd (you are currently), `journalctl` and `systemctl` help you dig into what's going on with your system. Piping with the symbols `|`, `>`, and `>>` will help you combine commands in powerful ways. 

Learn the filesystem and where things are stored. Programs are generally stored in `/bin`, programs that require root privileges are mostly in `/sbin`, configuration files in `/etc`, logs in `/var/log`, etc.

The best thing you can do to learn about linux is to do projects. Get yourself a raspberry pi and set up a DNS server, a VPN, and/or a DHCP server. Project ideas can be found at /r/raspberry_pi and /r/selfhosted. Most of all, enjoy the journey. It will be difficult and confusing at times, but very rewarding once you start to figure things out."

To give an example, my Xubuntu machine (XFCE) uses about 800MB of RAM on idle (600 on a fresh boot), which is almost half of what you have, without running any office/browser/video/audio applications.

If you want things to ""just work"" then I would suggest Lubuntu. You get the LXDE environment pre-installed and your hardware is pretty much guaranteed to work out of the box without any additional configuration. Very light, and minimal configuration involved.

If you really want to squeeze the most out of your machine, and are interested in learning about BSD, I would suggest FreeBSD with OpenBox. It will take some time to set up, but you will learn a lot, plus FreeBSD and OpenBox are both very light. There are some design decisions that make the BSDs and Linux different, and most of it comes back to software licensing. For instance, you can install ZFS on *BSD out of the box, whereas on Linux it's a bit of a project to get it working. If you plan on using FreeNAS, you are likely to want to use ZFS, so getting some experience in it is probably a good idea.

Given what you have said, I would lean towards trying out FreeBSD. You should learn a lot in the installation and setup process, which will be applicable when you eventually install FreeNAS. Keep in mind it will take a lot more tinkering than installing Debian, but if that doesn't scare you off, then it's probably worth a shot."
