AgeGapRelationship,fpv3vaw,t3_gfibpc,1588933946.0,My fianc√© is 28 and I‚Äôm 20 we‚Äôve been together since I was 18 so coming up on 3 years in December. We are great together but it‚Äôs gonna really depend if y‚Äôall are at the same place and want the same things. My fianc√© and I are about 5-9 years out from having kids and we are both in college. So even though we are 8.5 year apart we are basically at the same point in our lives. We are also very lucky and have had very little judgments from family because my parents are 19/20 years apart.
CPTSD,fplbjli,t1_fpl9pyl,1588709772.0,"I think that a lot of people tried to convince me while I was in foster care that my mother really did love me even though all of her actions showed otherwise. She constantly chose every man over my sister and I and would go as far as to say that she would call DHS have them take us away if we were acting up. I think that she feels an obligation to us and that other people would judge her if she Did not act as a mother even if in private she doesn‚Äôt care the least bit about us. I feel like a lot of people think that parent and child bonding is genetic or inherent but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the case. I think it‚Äôs a choice. My mother chose that my sister and I were too much and only worth her time when we made her look good. In my heart of hearts I don‚Äôt think that she ever loved me and that hurts. I think A lot of people try to soothe that hurt by telling us that our parents love us but they just can‚Äôt show us instead of saying that you‚Äôre right and that‚Äôs because of them not you.I think having a parent that doesn‚Äôt love you or isn‚Äôt capable of loving you the right Way is one of the deepest hurts any human could ever experience. It makes me feel very sad that so many people relate to not being loved by their parents because that‚Äôs not the way it supposed to be. I often grieve for my inner child who had to experience do you abuse, uncertainty, and world wind that my childhood was."
CPTSD,fpl21pz,t1_fpkujrm,1588704990.0,It does make it worse. However people I think try to excuse her behavior because of her mental illness. Basically she can do no wrong or can‚Äôt be held accountable for her actions even though she can drive and take care of herself and anything else or any other person who is accountable can do. I think it‚Äôs utter bullshit that basically she gets off and never have to deal with any of the repercussions of her actions.
CPTSD,fpkx5nr,t1_fpjy78f,1588702573.0,"If being a single parent means abusing your children physically mentally or sexually, you shouldn‚Äôt be a parent at all. It makes me so upset that people think it‚Äôs OK to abuse their children because they birthed them."
CPTSD,fpkwybo,t1_fpjviva,1588702471.0,Honestly it would almost be better if she died. Not because I want her to be dead but because it would be easier to explain and she wouldn‚Äôt still be causing trouble in my life also my anxiety towards what the future looks like would decrease significantly.
CPTSD,fpkgy5m,t1_fpjwwyq,1588694499.0,My fianc√© likes to say ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs love got to do with it‚Äù when someone is stuck in a toxic situation and they say that.
CPTSD,fpkgufd,t1_fpjwj0n,1588694444.0,"I completely agree with love is actions not words. It‚Äôs like just because someone says they shit gold doesn‚Äôt make it true. A lot of people just have to believe that parents inherently love their offspring when that‚Äôs not true. My mom told me she loved me as many times as she told me she hated me, thought I was stupid, a b*tch, and so much more."
CPTSD,fpkgfji,t1_fpjvcxu,1588694229.0,I understand that. My bf at the time i left my moms home told me ‚ÄúWas it even that bad?‚Äù. I‚Äôm like sorry I‚Äôm hard to believe or something. I think people just don‚Äôt want to believe that parents can be worst than an stranger could imagine.
CPTSD,fpkg2cq,t1_fpjp711,1588694037.0,"I‚Äôm my opinion if she could just admit what she has done wrong, I could let go and maybe be civil with her. However I refuse to let someone who tries to gaslight me when I talk about my childhood traumas be apart of my life. I have very little contact and even then it‚Äôs brief. I don‚Äôt care to hear about her life nor do I wish to share mine with her."
CPTSD,fpkflxe,t1_fpiu1eg,1588693800.0,My mom likes to pretend to be a great mom who still has contact with my sister and I. She constantly post about us and tags us in post. It‚Äôs very frustrating because she maybe attempts actually contact once every few months. I‚Äôve also told her I don‚Äôt like it and I untag myself. I really just want to post on there ‚ÄúI am who I am in spite of you not because of you‚Äù
CPTSD,fpkf1w8,t1_fpk2m8z,1588693507.0,My mom actually picked it up from a counselor. I have NC most of the time other than when she is in town. Luckily she lives a solid 6 hours away and only comes once or twice a year. I think it‚Äôs good advice especially when you are stuck in an abusive situation.
CPTSD,fpjnclt,t1_fpitysi,1588674895.0,That‚Äôs the exact reason why I left my mothers home at 17. It came to a point where the abuse was so bad that I would do anything to escape. And she used to tell me all the time about how if it‚Äôs you or me I‚Äôm gonna pick me so I took her advice and when it was me or her I picked me. It was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve ever had to do but my life is better for it. This is also why it‚Äôs so hard when people try to tell me that she loves me because I don‚Äôt think that love should be painful or almost kill you.
CPTSD,fpjn4zj,t1_fpirmb3,1588674681.0,That‚Äôs the thing for me. She tells me that she loves me or she misses me but then makes absolutely no effort to be a consistent or reliable person. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so frustrating when people try to tell me that she loves me because even if she was capable of love she has absolutely no healthy way of showing it so is it even really love.

CPTSDmemes,foryj4q,t1_fory84z,1588020750.0,This quarantine has been triggering me nonstop. This is because I spent almost 3/4 years stuck in my house because my mom would isolate me from everyone.

It‚Äôs really sad to me that these kids are up here 9+ hours everyday especially when the parent is working at home all day.
walmart,fnwxs30,t1_fnwqh85,1587327544.0,The parents that before the pandemic that would give their kids medicine for being sick and still bring them to school. These parents enjoy the idea and status of having children but don‚Äôt want the reality of having to take care of their children. They don‚Äôt want to deal with the kids they created.

I work in child care and since we are considered essential I have to go to work. I work for a childcare facility that only serves one company and that company is working form home. It‚Äôs very sad that we still have 65-80+ children in my child care place everyday while their parents are AT HOME. When I try to voice my opinion though they say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure they just need a break‚Äù or that ‚ÄúThey are still working even from home they can‚Äôt do that with their kids.‚Äù I think it‚Äôs excuses and bullshit because YOU decide to have 3 kids that You didn‚Äôt wanna deal with and would rather put your own child at risk of getting sick/getting others sick because You couldn‚Äôt just keep them home during a literal pandemic.

Ex_Foster,fniss7b,t3_g1u89u,1586985732.0,"Just realized reunification doesn‚Äôt always turn out all peachy. I was reunified with my mother after being out of her home 1.5 years. After 3 months she started fighting with and hit my sister. Then after 6 months my sister turned 18 and moved out because my mom tried to beat her up. I soon became the new scapegoat and got all of the neglect, emotional abuse, and physical abuse. I endured that for 3 years before finally leaving. I reached out for help many time through out that time. I tried to tell the cops many times but they thought I was a troubled teen and since DHS rarely communicates cross county lines I was stuck."
AmItheAsshole,fn6ezbb,t3_fzleix,1586697440.0,NTA sadly so many Christians claim to be oppressed just because they don‚Äôt understand freedom of religion means that you won‚Äôt be Persecuted by the government not that everyone has to kiss your butt to be politically correct. Not all Christians are that way but a lot are and they think they are entitled to do and say whatever they want just because it‚Äôs their religion.

I‚Äôm gonna go out on a limb here and say he‚Äôd think that‚Äôs absolutely disgusting and would refuse. He sounds like an ass but if you want that good Luck to you guys.
Fosterparents,fmjg4n0,t1_fmigwv3,1586129648.0,Restricting your foster child to only have two hours of communication with biological family and friends is awful (especially considering that fact we are in quarantine). Even if the mom isn‚Äôt the best influence she doesn‚Äôt seem to be a danger to her daughter and keeping her away from her mother would be catastrophic. These foster parents should not be telling the biological mother what she needs to be doing with her child. They need to be building a relationship with her and the mother needs to be working on her plan. They are not mental health professionals nor are they caseworkers.
Fosterparents,fmitfea,t1_fmir1yh,1586116554.0,"I understand what you are talking about but isolation from mother would be so much worse at this point. My mom constantly disappoints me and my sister. Sadly she will never be a stable or constant person in my life. I‚Äôm 20 years old and my mom still has a profound impact of my emotional state when she flakes on plans or ghosts me. It‚Äôs hard to be in foster care even if you are in a safer environment. I think when you have teenagers you need to act as positive influence rather than someone who controls their life. She isn‚Äôt grown but she will never learn how to think for herself and problem solve if everyone around her tells her what to do. I think empowering her to make choices in a safe place in a safe way will go a long way. Becoming resilient is so important and I‚Äôd maybe take the time to build short term and long term goals with her. Also if you are still worried about her becoming a teen mom I‚Äôd talk through what a good parent looks like, how much money she will need to care for herself and her child, and what kinds of jobs would provide the type of money and flexibility to do that. As a teen I wanted a baby so much but as I get older and realize that I want to be able to spend time with, nurture, and give my child a lot of opportunities in this world. This has been the main reason for deciding that I won‚Äôt have kids for the next 7-10 years. Children are great but imagine the life you can nurture if you are financially, physically, and  emotionally healthy. Just take this time in quarantine to build a relationship with her because end of day she needs positive influences."
Fosterparents,fmio7th,t3_fvh0ui,1586113527.0,As someone who grew up in foster care and was in foster care from 12 till 14 years old. I believed my mom walked on water for a very long time because it is easier to think that the government is against you then to think that the person that was supposed to love you and care about you fucked up and messed up your life. It‚Äôs super common for Teenagers to people obsessed with boyfriends/girlfriends and for girls to like babies. If I were you I‚Äôd look for a mentoring program and get her volunteering somewhere where she can take care of babies. I‚Äôd also recommend against keeping her from her mother because it will only make you into the the villain.She need to be the one to decide to take a step back from her mother.

ChildcareWorkers,fmc7pmv,t1_fm4s6jm,1585940456.0,I think that bigger corporations should discount because they can afford it and the government is more likely to bail them out. These bigger corporations also will probably only pay their employees for the following two weeks after closing so anything collected after that point will just be pure profit. I think that small home child care places should be able to receive unemployment but if they are not I think asking for continuing to ask for pay is understandable. In a perfect world America would already have a system set up to be able to support the people that are out of a job. Sadly a lot of Americans see this as a socialist ideal and won‚Äôt support it. My governor is currently trying to restrict unemployment to 12 weeks which will leave many homeless or in debt once this pandemic is over.
ChildcareWorkers,fm09zcq,t3_fs2apv,1585650545.0,I work for a large company that owns a chain of childcare businesses and they are still collecting money from the parents whether or not they are temporarily closed. This is money to hold their spot for when we reopen. If my work place closes I will get paid for the following 2 weeks then I will have to file for unemployment. I can understand your frustration but realize if you drop and she decides to not hold your spot you can‚Äôt be upset. Everyone is struggling right now and most childcare places do expect the parent to pay to hold a spot for that child. I‚Äôd just hate for you to drop out of the home childcare program then struggle to find another program with a spot for your child to attend after all of this ends.

I suggest you let her know that you were wrong and apologize (this part is very important to make it better.) she just a child and isn‚Äôt aware enough of her own personal preferences to know if she‚Äôd like a new thing or not.

I started having a legitimate panic attack and I felt so afraid for them. I know my sister would never let them go with her unsupervised but it‚Äôs a terrifying thought.

It‚Äôs best to try and be gentle and comfort yourself because sometimes that‚Äôs what we need.

CPTSD,fjy05vc,t1_fjxy7z1,1583687185.0,Yes absolutely she is specifically thinks that my foster mother talks and about her leading us to not want to have a relationship with her. I was taken from my mother for about 1.5 years and when I went back she was back to being herself within 3 months. I didn‚Äôt speak up at the time and when I eventually did the cops basically thought that I was just a troubled child. I was stuck and thought it would get better. However after 4 years of dealing with her it never got better only worst. I eventually ran away at 17.5 because I was contemplating suicide again and honestly didn‚Äôt have any fight left in me. I moved back in with my foster mother and got my life back on track. I‚Äôm almost 20.5 and I‚Äôve had very little contact with her ever since I left other than when I had to get her from a mental health institution about 1.5 years ago. She is just so oblivious to how bad she made my life.
AmItheAsshole,fjxt0wa,t1_fjxlcm6,1583682660.0,Sounds like she has established fight as her first response to abuse. This is talked about in the book CPTSD. OP is an a**hole and is still emotionally abusing his daughter. It makes me so sad that not only is she clearly being treated as the scapegoat and that OP is so oblivious that he hasn‚Äôt changed. He sounds exactly like my mom who went to counseling then would say that I was being emotionally abusive when she would be ignoring me or straight up punishing for insubordination. My mother was a narcissistic abuser who made sure I knew how awful and bad I was and only praised me as a response to how awesome of a mother she is. I have spend years in therapy and I still have very strong feelings about my childhood and my mother. OP should honestly have walked away if he couldn‚Äôt handle his wife having a child that wasn‚Äôt his.

Honestly I believe to change how many child abuse cases we have, parents need to go to parenting classes. They should also go to many child development classes and counseling sessions between the parents then just individually. To many families parents think it‚Äôs totally fine to beat their children or verbally abuse them because that‚Äôs how they were raised. We honestly need a whole system change to try and prevent abuse and provide resources to those who need help."

Sure it‚Äôs a nice gesture but people need to stop acting like just because someone created life it makes the child obligated to do whatever their parents want. You are in no way obligated to do anything for this man and she is just upset that she can‚Äôt guilt you into it. I‚Äôd just stay far way from her and call it a day.

CPTSD,fjizmd7,t1_fjixpug,1583379505.0,I feel that I was always good at homework it‚Äôs predictable. I use to fly through work to keep myself distracted from everything.

I grew up in poverty and always felt out of place no matter where I was. I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy being called trash but maybe it‚Äôs an inside joke or you think it‚Äôs funny. I joke probably too often about dying so i have no room to talk about anything.
CPTSD,fjh4fn2,t1_fjgrfvj,1583341036.0,Truth everyone would say I was the perfect child and I was just want to learn everything. When in reality I was constantly stressed out trying to figure out life struggling with my self image. I was also trying to work through my own trauma and take care of my mom when she was sad. I use to scratch my arms to try and control my emotions because I had seen my own mother cut her arms open. I luckily had many teachers who took an interest in me because of my smarts. However I couldn‚Äôt deal with change so I had lots of outbursts leading to my never having friends as a child.
CPTSD,fjh3r8d,t3_fdcge7,1583340664.0,"I use to tell people that how am I supposed to be normal when I‚Äôve never seen what normal is. It‚Äôs a day to day struggle to try and not minimize my abuse. It‚Äôs hard because no one wants to think that their life was bad or something to be a ashamed of. As someone who doesn‚Äôt know what normal is it‚Äôs kinda strange to see these families and people who aren‚Äôt scared, paranoid, or anything towards others. I sometimes think how can I get to be how they are naturally because I can‚Äôt just go with the flow or just let go. I have always been the one to think it through and I have to make sure that I‚Äôm safe and have a plan if things so south."
CPTSD,fjgc921,t1_fjgbv8d,1583321621.0,Truth and I can‚Äôt stand that she can still have this much control over me. It‚Äôs very frustrating to feel like you can‚Äôt control yourself or your feelings. I know that I shouldn‚Äôt beat myself up so much but it‚Äôs easier to be mad at myself then at her. That‚Äôs because I know she will never Change and being mad at her seems useless.
CPTSD,fjgc2k8,t1_fjg1221,1583321409.0,I feel like it‚Äôs easier to validate the physical abuse I‚Äôve been through rather than the emotional abuse. That‚Äôs hard because emotional abuse can be very apparent to completely hidden. My mom was very good at making everyone else seem like the bad guy so sometimes she even convinced me that I deserved it. It‚Äôs like the time I didnt seem to appreciate a gift enough so she lectured me for hours . Then when I finally throws to leave she somehow got me on the ground and was sitting on my chest. I felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe and I just kept ask/telling her to get off I can‚Äôt breathe. And then she‚Äôs say ‚Äúif you can talk you can breathe‚Äù and I was still in my head after beating myself up because ‚ÄúI should have acted more excited and happy‚Äù I feel like if I accept how bad it was then it will take over everything.
CPTSD,fjgbosl,t1_fjfz98a,1583320942.0,It‚Äôs kinda like if you are just being dramatic then it‚Äôs not so sad. Sometimes I feel myself grieving for being the way I am. I sometimes get so overwhelmed by things other people let roll off there back that it becomes very frustrating to be me. It also doesn‚Äôt help that everyone expects me to be normal and I just can‚Äôt handle it. Then when I finally lose it I feel like such a POS and just incredibly Emotionally unstable. Then that feeling makes me feel worst because I keep thinking I should be able to do this. It‚Äôs honestly a very bad cycle of feelings.
CPTSD,fjfivgl,t3_fd08ks,1583292697.0,Bump all that stuff about forgiving those people. I don‚Äôt have to forgive nothing and I‚Äôm certainly never involving myself with them again. People have this belief that forgiveness makes everything okay and will make you feel so much better. However most abusive people won‚Äôt even recognize why they need forgiveness and also will use that as a way to try and make you let them in your life again.
CPTSD,fjfgpn2,t1_fjfg95d,1583291450.0,Yes the statistics are really against us breaking out the the cycle. I‚Äôm constantly doubting whether I‚Äôm being to passive or if I‚Äôm being to aggressive with my behavior management tactics. I‚Äôm so worried about just messing everything up around me because it‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve been around any good enough people.
CPTSD,fjffn54,t1_fjffak7,1583290810.0,Truth and you can never be 100% certain you would somehow end up with another abuser or become one yourself. It‚Äôs a big fear of mine to be just like her and not know or become anything like her. At the same time the older I get the more I look like her so it‚Äôs can feel triggering to even look in the mirror sometimes.
CPTSD,fjea3jw,t1_fjch8th,1583267975.0,My watched my mom slit her arms from wrist to elbow . She tried to commit Suicide countless times. She use to tell us she wish she‚Äôd had an abortion or that she‚Äôd call dhs if we didn‚Äôt act better because we were to much to handle. She also use to tell us that foster parents abused their kids and would do unmentionable things to us if we ever went. She installed so much fear into us that if we spoke up that we‚Äôd never see our family or sisters ever again while being horribly abused. She‚Äôs a really winner as a parent lol
CPTSD,fjbw6ab,t1_fjb8zas,1583202762.0,Lol my mom can‚Äôt keep an animal any longer than 6 months. She usually gets a puppy and once they aren‚Äôt cute anymore the she‚Äôs done. It‚Äôs kinda how she was with us except she couldn‚Äôt get rid of us so she just blamed us and resented us for existing.
AmItheAsshole,fj7vz01,t3_fbv7ty,1583099485.0,NTA- he‚Äôs very immature and childish. All women in their reproductive years bleed. He doesn‚Äôt seem to understand periods at all and seem insecure. He‚Äôs also probably one of those guys that would refuse to kiss you after you give them a blow job. I‚Äôd say you dodged a bullet and just try to move on to someone more mature and secure:
CPTSD,fj5fv3q,t1_fj5eudd,1583031663.0,My sister was the fighter and as a kid I didn‚Äôt get why she couldn‚Äôt just listen. Then when I got older I realized that it‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt matter if you listen or don‚Äôt listen you get punished anyways. The older I got the worst the abuse was and no one believed me other than her. My mom was terrible and a great manipulator.
CPTSD,fj5fhkl,t1_fj5evwx,1583031417.0,I really appreciate that. I‚Äôm usually so busy and preoccupied with taking care of my kids at work that I don‚Äôt have to many flashbacks anymore so when the do come it‚Äôs hard to process at all.
CPTSD,fj5er27,t1_fj5e4sq,1583030914.0,I feel that. I‚Äôm usually so good at keeping all these feelings at bay that when they come it‚Äôs like my heart is in my throat. I don‚Äôt feel like actually talking and I want to go hide in my closet and disappear tbh.
CPTSD,fj5ee9f,t1_fj5dzej,1583030674.0,I‚Äôm trying to get that but I think it‚Äôs just hard to separate the guilt and shame associated with abuse in general. I am thinking back with my older self brain and trying to get why I didn‚Äôt do anything then or say anything.
CPTSD,fj5dzju,t1_fj5dqb7,1583030403.0,That‚Äôs funny I like that. I‚Äôll try it. Thank you
CPTSD,fj5dvys,t1_fj5d428,1583030339.0,I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôve been through enough to be as messed up as I am to be honest here. I know it‚Äôs not true because I have been though a lot but it‚Äôs just how I‚Äôm feeling.
CPTSD,fj5dpeu,t1_fj5d14a,1583030218.0,I know but I was the golden child til I wasn‚Äôt. I made her life really hard as a kid and didn‚Äôt realize what I was doing. My mom really pinned me and my sister against each other for a long time. At the age of 10 we finally came to the agreement that we do everything together and not involve them in our world. Then it was us against them but I feel to blame for some of her abuse since I would tell on her and make threats to tell.
CPTSD,fj5dbas,t1_fj5czzz,1583029954.0,I know what she said isn‚Äôt true but it kinda is to. It‚Äôs really hard to logic away feelings and especially ones that your inner critic loves to throw in your face.
CPTSD,fj5bhz3,t1_fj4oe4c,1583028759.0,My exact thoughts lol. I don‚Äôt want to be strong this shit sucks. I want to normal naive and carefree like I shouldn‚Äôt be struggling so much to make it through the day.
entitledparents,fj3g9jf,t3_fb5qie,1582982605.0,I have a stuffed bear named Russ. He was my moms bear when she was like 6 years old then when I turned 3 she gave him to me. He‚Äôs as sturdy as even but if someone tried to take him we‚Äôd be fighting. My sister once asked if I was gonna give him to one of my nephew‚Äôs because I‚Äôm yet to have kids and he seemed to like it. I just have her a death stare and said no he‚Äôs mine. I‚Äôll probably keep him forever if not give him to my kid eventually... I don‚Äôt know though we will see
CPTSD,fj05wds,t3_fanbza,1582890328.0,"I don‚Äôt even have to try hard to see why my mom and dad were the way they were or my grandparents. My mother suffered sexual, emotional and physical abuse. My step dad suffered through sexual abuse, emotional and physical. Both suffer from extreme mental illness and can be normal when on meds. In my opinion it still doesn‚Äôt excuse their behavior. I could never imagine putting my own child through what I went through and I have been in counseling to help me work through my problems. My mother was given many chances to change and not go back to her abusive ways. Instead she used her counseling as a weapon and try to tell me anytime I needed love and attention outside of the time she wanted that I was trying to emotionally manipulate her."
CPTSD,fiq0280,t3_f94mal,1582630068.0,I can‚Äôt really have any contact with my mother without becoming completely upset. Sometimes just seeing her on social media can send me into a tailspin especially because she constantly post about my sister and I. She doesn‚Äôt post bad things about us but it‚Äôs very frustrating that she doesn‚Äôt attempt to have relationship with me but feels like it‚Äôs okay to talk about me at all like she is this great parent. My step dad and I are fairly close but since he has apologized and makes an effort to be a regular fixture in my life it‚Äôs easier to talk with him. It helps a lot that I feel like I can talk about the past without him becoming defensive or saying that I‚Äôm lying. My mom has straight up told me that what I say I lived through didn‚Äôt happen or it wasn‚Äôt her fault. She can never just accept responsibility or accept that she is the reason I don‚Äôt talk to her. It is super complicated and most people don‚Äôt understand because ‚Äúshe‚Äôs your mom‚Äù which I think is a stupid reason to let someone destroy your mental health.
CPTSD,fio57mh,t3_f8paro,1582576524.0,My god mom likes to say that people only have a limited number of spoons and when you have a mental or physical illness it takes up more of those spoons. Some days I have enough spoons to make it through the day and other days I don‚Äôt. It is more about knowing you limits and taking care of yourself first and foremost.
CPTSD,finhbkh,t3_f8op8x,1582563353.0,My mom would go through chapters of being super religious. We had a five finger rule from our collarbone and the hands by our side for shorts. We were constantly told to cover up and we weren‚Äôt allowed out of our side of the house during certain times or unless we were properly dressed. This has lead to a lot of shame and anxiety surrounding dressing showing any skin. We were always told how bad people outside our home were and we needed to cover up to protect us.
CPTSD,fily941,t3_f8i16q,1582513268.0,I totally get not wanting to answer any questions especially those relating to your life or passions. I once shared my insecurity about my weight gain after starting to take depression medication after a suicide attempt with my mother. Then one time while we were fighting she looked me straight  in the  eye and said ‚ÄúI know why you are so fat! ‚Äú. It was stupid of me to share any insecurities with her but I can‚Äôt ever get that little segment of time out of my head. Being vulnerable or personal about anything for everyone is hard and even harder if you have only ever had someone who used those things against you.
CPTSD,filw0yf,t1_filuemt,1582511699.0,We had a talk about it and he says he just doesn‚Äôt want it to become a crutch. I understand that he doesn‚Äôt really understand it. I just told him it isn‚Äôt a crutch and I don‚Äôt even use it every night only when I‚Äôm alone. So I think we‚Äôll be good. It‚Äôs nice to know that I‚Äôm not alone because honestly as an adult it‚Äôs embarrassing but it‚Äôs better than having to deal with the intrusive thoughts and nightmares.
CPTSD,fikoaci,t1_fikkjd4,1582484130.0,I think it‚Äôs less about the stuffed animal and more about what it stands for. He relates it to being childish and since we have an age gap it makes him feel like he‚Äôs engaged to a child. I have tried to explaining it but I feel like he doesn‚Äôt understand about how bad the intrusive thoughts are and how you can‚Äôt just ‚Äúbe strong‚Äù or ‚ÄúJust get over it‚Äù. It‚Äôs comforting to think that I‚Äôm not the only one that still sleeps with a stuffed animal because it is embarrassing but it genuinely reliefs a lot of my anxiety and fear about sleep.
CPTSD,fikgfvq,t1_fikg78i,1582479874.0,Lol I can agree with that but I only bring one at a time and usually only when he‚Äôs not in the bed while I‚Äôm trying to go to sleep.
CPTSD,figbk2m,t3_f7uc45,1582397874.0,"I often had to act as my mothers people detector and would be blamed if these people ended up stealing, hurting her, or anything else. It was a lot of responsibility and a lot of the time she wouldn‚Äôt listen to me because ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want her to have someone who loves her‚Äù and would call me warden. She was my best friend because she isolated me from anyone everyone that seemed like a threat to her control over me. She is a hand full of drama and I‚Äôve chosen at this point to try to take a step back from our relationship."
unpopularopinion,ficmsqe,t3_f7jpov,1582352465.0,"My father struggles with mental illness and ended up leaving my sister and I with our mother because of it. My mother also has mental health issues but can typically come across as fine until you spend extended time with her. She is a straight up liar, abuser, and constantly picks guys over her children. When my father finally terminated his rights he said ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt want to fight with her anymore.‚Äù And I feel this in the core of my being. I left home at 17 because I simply couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and wouldn‚Äôt be here today if I had stayed. I will always have love for my mother because she is my mom but I can‚Äôt stand her. She is emotionally exhausted and makes me feel awful so I have very very little contact and I‚Äôm trying to work up the nerve to cut her out of my life completely."
CPTSD,ficlsr0,t3_f7izv2,1582351445.0,Sometimes I wake up terrified and don‚Äôt know why. I legitimately as an adult can‚Äôt fall asleep without white noise w/ a person or stuff animal with me. I use to be able to suffice with just some asmr but after I got sexually assaulted in my sleep it changed. I still sometimes can remember that fear of going to sleep from when I was little. I wouldn‚Äôt know if tonight was gonna be a night I got taken out of bed because of a parental fight or if the police would come. It‚Äôs scary to go to bed because I know I can‚Äôt protect myself if I‚Äôm asleep. I refuse sleep meds because of the same fear and the side effects aren‚Äôt worth it in my opinion.
CPTSD,fickky4,t3_f7kf6t,1582350213.0,I feel that most people who have had parents who put them through a childhood of trauma would agree. I have legitimately said while in one of my college English classes that I wish my mom would have aborted me. It‚Äôs not because I want to die but the amount of pain is unimaginable. The teacher even tried to say I don‚Äôt believe that but I have thought that ever since I first got dragged down the hall by my hair. I am not constantly falling apart anymore but I know I‚Äôll never be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù and that‚Äôs a terrible feeling. I remember so many times in my childhood of being in such a bad emotional place that I would scratch my arms raw and starve myself and fall asleep crying. No child deserves that type of pain and abuse. I think it‚Äôs better for someone to never experience pain that to spend years enduring the person who should love you most make your life a living hell.
ptsd,fhu3qvp,t3_f4odvc,1581881525.0,I completely get the feeling of never being healed. I have made leaps and bounds from the person I was during my abuse and I‚Äôm sure you have too. That‚Äôs the thing about going through abuse it changes the way you view the world and yourself. Some days are easier than other but it‚Äôs okay to have those bad days. Try to be easy on yourself and reassure yourself of your worth  everyday. You have gotten so far and it‚Äôs okay to be sad/angry/upset about the things that have happened just don‚Äôt let them consume you.
