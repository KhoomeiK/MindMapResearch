diablo3,fqiqsyd,t3_gj63tj,1589399622.0,"Diablo 3's story is not awful but is absolutely no where comparable to divinty original sin. If you are looking for isometric games cause of divinity orginal sin for the elements of story and turn based gameplay that is not what is here. If you are looking for build optimizing, looting and grinding this is quite fun. I personally really enjoy the game but I put it on the side of numbing rather feeling if we use yahtzee croshaws scaling. This is not bad but I do not think it is you are seeking."
Persona5,fqdv0q0,t1_fqduotw,1589297080.0,Yeah she is one of two new confidants.
PS4Deals,fq3gzw2,t1_fq32sl9,1589066358.0,I think it depends on province for if their is tax or not. I believe if you set to one of them no tax. I can not remember which though.
Borderlands,fpxw9jr,t1_fpv4yy7,1588990863.0,I am so stupid I forgot to do this.
Persona5,fpskfjc,t1_fpsk8fc,1588874969.0,The thing about koei techmo is that I find all their orginal stuff quite meh but they do a great job adapting other stuff to their formula. I would love scramble on switch along with my pirate warriors 3 and hopefully hyrule warriors.
Persona5,fpsk40h,t3_gf6ih8,1588874814.0,I just want scramble in the west. Is that too much to ask for?
Persona5,fpjzp9q,t1_fpjyv3w,1588684952.0,"I agree the new ost is a lot of good stuff. I also am a big fan of Gentle madman. As in terms of story and music I am a bit torn. As I have a special place in my heart for futuba's palace, and I think nothing overcomes sae's palace in terms of overall narrative weight. However it takes elements from both which I do love. It is definitely in the top palace ranks for me.

Edit: to remove spoilers as the formatting did not seem to work."
Persona5,fp762ck,t1_fp75y6a,1588364715.0,Won't deny it does look cool. And good naming sense. I went with Heartgrave.
Persona5,fp75pyt,t1_fp7540m,1588364537.0,Could you not just remove the last s as another option? As it would be clear either way

Persona5,fn4v2aj,t3_frk55g,1586649605.0,Can for the love of heavens someone explain to me how to scale the wall for the blue pride will seed?  The prompt does not show to scale the wall and I do not know what I need to do. Talking to the waiter in the restaurant does not seem to do anything despite what I saw. Edit: nevermind I am stupid I got it.
PS4,fmjfukg,t3_fvlspr,1586129484.0,Thanks for doing it.
DND5EBuilds,flcmaoa,t3_fnoocb,1585036683.0,Tbh mate you are fine with that setup. A monk is mostly trying not to get hit in the first place. Especially given with astral arms you attack from 10 feet away opportunity attacks are less likely to be an issue. Are there any other frontlines? If so let them take the hits.
DnD,fl5g3hj,t1_fl5epie,1584835904.0,Oh he definitely was not murder hobo. I am sorry if I implied as such. His character was just...evil? Following a life god and contradicting everything about it without any reason was just odd.

Games,fdq830a,t3_emagrf,1578658770.0,The art style seems a lot better and the demo minor spoiler the demo just let's you pick and end of quiz if you do not like your choice which is a lot easier.
Games,fdq4hbv,t3_emagrf,1578654425.0,If it makes me feel half as much a explorers of time did that I am all for it. God that walk back with your partner still makes me cry.
rickandmorty,fcmwd71,t3_ehwfts,1577795278.0,I would even add sherlock to this. Yes he is shown to be a genius but an eccentric one with no social skills who actively hurts people around him and himself in his boredom.
panelshow,fc6vsqb,t1_fc4hk2u,1577490780.0,"Remember for Bob his memory ""is like fingerprints in the dust on an abandoned handrail"" as he puts it. Though I think jon Richardson put it best saying bob believes the stories he tells."
Games,fc6v288,t3_egaave,1577490243.0,"Agreed.  I found the persona series a couple years ago with 5, which takes this to an extreme extent. About half the game is just building relationships.  It helps you bring you into the world and helps you feel the reason behind each dungeon you go into. This sort of party mingling seems more common on the jrpg as you are a given character rather than a self made one making it a bit easier. However, I would like to see more western studios like bioware and obsidian do similar things. Hopefully dragon age 4 comes out fine or obsidian makes a fantasy rpg cause when they do I will be all for it."
DND5EBuilds,f90dxsr,t1_f90cm5i,1574971023.0,That I don't have any clue. Sorry bout that. I do not see why not but ask your DM for the final word.
DND5EBuilds,f9069jv,t1_f905vip,1574968540.0,Yes. As long as the dagger is already held in 5he offhand you can use a bonus action to attack with it but the thrown attack does not get ablity modifier to damage. If you dont have a dagger already in the hand the *Edit:Fighting style I am not sure whether or not you can grab one with but should not matter as you can still draw or stow one weapon per turn freely.
DND5EBuilds,f905sq0,t1_f904xsf,1574968355.0,"You may draw per attack made in the Attack action so long as that attack is with the weapon you are throwing.

Edit as far as I understand it."
DND5EBuilds,f8yv4ll,t3_e2lxz5,1574953269.0,You would need to take the UA fighting style as otherwise you can only draw a single weapon for turn which could be crippling at higher levels. Even by level 5 after turn one you would be stuck with one attack per turn.

Forty millenniums of cultivation is also a favourite."

PS4,f5z1bju,t1_f5z0wwp,1572565108.0,Okay
PS4,f5ygkoj,t1_f5yfw0l,1572555846.0,Yes but for the demo station if you are playing it and the standard ps4 is in front of you I doubt the demo shows in the corner or anywhere running on ps4 pro like a trailer.
PS4,f5yf0l4,t1_f5ydxec,1572555163.0,But if it is a different unit actually running the game ( example a ps4 pro and the ps4 is what is shown) would that not be considered false advertising?
borderlands3,f4la5fy,t1_f4l86gr,1571664433.0,That's sad as most of endgame foes I think are health and shields predominantly
borderlands3,f4l7ok1,t1_f4l7c8p,1571663465.0,I think graveward is all health so corrosive should do regular damage. I think there was a hotfix were they increased his resistance to elements so that could be the reason.
borderlands3,f4l6rvx,t1_f4l6kmi,1571663108.0,It still does regular damage on graveward so there's that.edit: I think

DnD,f3um9k5,t1_f3trqa2,1571163241.0,The dice look very nice
noveltranslations,f3ju9wt,t1_f3ibh48,1570958454.0,I am caught up with translations as well
noveltranslations,f3hbafe,t3_dgv79l,1570921394.0,Am reading city of sin. As a DM I like the incorpartions of the D&D mechanics and the lore with an interesting enough spin. Still typical xuanhuan but different enough to stay interesting.
Disgaea,f2ild7s,t3_ddfvw5,1570258890.0,Final fantasy tatics is not as over the top but might fit the bill.
noveltranslations,f2bsk10,t1_f2bsbob,1570130490.0,No to be rude spoiler tag or something for ffs.
noveltranslations,f280fl8,t1_f27x2kb,1570049946.0,"Regular op with a decent bit of philosophy. Another I recommend highly is forty millenniums of cultivation where single individuals help decide the battles but wars are won by armies and the clash of ideologys. Both unlike most in the genre are not mindless powerfests but take a bit more nuanced look at the consequences to the world  as a result of living with cultivation. Go check them out. They still contain plenty of the standard stuff from the genre just deeper.

Edit for both unlike most in the genre I recommend reading them by books as the arcs are far more narratively defined than just power level and location increases which still happen but more in narrative tandem."
DnDHomebrew,f1v15h2,t3_dahb7k,1569765874.0,The damage on venomous soul seems to scale up way too high. With a high level monk all strikes can be unarmed and if using flurry of blows can result in 80 damage directly for the cost of 5 ki points total which is stronger than other monks capstones. And if you miss the attack you don't lose the resource to begin with. Even a fighter with great weapon master and action surge only gets an equivalent amount of bonus damage if they land all eight of their attacks and has a lower chance of doing so as they have a penalty before the attack. The fact you can choose to do it after the attack hits like divine smite seems quite overpowered. I would say for balancing the ki point should be spent before the attack roll is made or change the damage to be martial dice based like an additional dice of martial arts poison damage which which does weaken the feature but makes it a bit more tactful. If it a crit it will feel better than just flat damage bonus and does not allow just after the fact a fixed damage unlike any other feature in the game (that I know of) Perhaps if power needs to be increased at a later level (Edit: level 11 seems like a good choice for that) improve the power like in the recent astral self unearthed arcana that it now is 2 martial arts dice if using an unarmed strike so it is not just 20 damage flat. That honestly still seems a bit op for the ki cost but still brings it more in line with the other monk subclasses.

OandD,ezjkpjw,t1_ezjixop,1567946151.0,"Rule set is pretty standard stuff with some minor for house rules modifications that I am looking into. Stuff like healing potions bonus action or set hp restoration. I don't care much for inventory weight as well within reason. Character creation I would prefer point buy or standard array at player choice of either as I prefer the characters to all be reasonably balanced stat wise at least. As the campaign is a bit diffcult intially I am considering to ban variant human and just allow a free feat at level 1 regardless of race.  This makes a more varied race party which I think works better. In terms of material all sourcebooks are free game (any combination thereof no PHB+1 rule), unearthed arcana and homebrew may be allowed if discussed with me first and balanced or modified as needed."
