Anyway, because you asked what an individual settler can do to help reconcile, here's a comment I made on the topic in another subreddit:

* Whose land are you on, right now? Learn the names of the nations whose land you occupy. Learn about their historical experiences, and learn about what they're going through now.
* Learn the language of the people whose land you're on. If you live near a Native Friendship Centre, they often have free classes in the local Indigenous language. I'm taking Mi'kmaq language lessons at my local Friendship Centre.
* Learn about challenges Indigenous communities are facing in Canada right now. For example, learn about the [colonial violence](https://www.ienearth.org/all-eyes-on-wetsuweten/) the Wet'suwet'en Nation is facing as they attempt to defend their own land from encroachment. Learn about the [experiences](https://www.childandyouthadvocate.nf.ca/pdfs/IndependentReview2019.pdf) that Inuit children are having in foster care--many of them are unable to speak their own languages, cannot pronounce their own names, and do not know how many brothers or sisters they have.
* Learn the [94 Calls to Action](http://trc.ca/assets/pdf/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf) of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. Learn about how they have or have not been [implemented](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/longform-single/beyond-94?&cta=1).
* Was there a residential school in your area? [Find out](https://www.cbc.ca/news2/interactives/beyond-94-residential-school-map/), and listen to or read the stories of survivors.
* Learn about the issue of [Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls](https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/). Read the [final report](https://www.mmiwg-ffada.ca/final-report/) of the National Inquiry into MMIWG, and learn its 231 Calls for Justice.
* If there are MMIWG memorials, Orange Shirt Day events, or protests or rallies against anti-Indigenous racism in your area, attend them and show your support for the Indigenous community.
* Think critically about the ways that colonial norms play out in Canadian society. Learn about [Indigenization](https://www.ictinc.ca/blog/a-brief-definition-of-decolonization-and-indigenization).
* Learn about the lives of Indigenous peoples prior to contact. Learn about the ways historical figures held up as heroes in many classrooms (in Canada, John A. MacDonald; in America, figures like George Washington, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, and Andrew Jackson) have interacted with Indigenous peoples. Read Bartolome de las Casas' first-hand account of Columbus' disastrous interactions with the Indigenous peoples of the Bahamas, [A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies](http://www.columbia.edu/~daviss/work/files/presentations/casshort/casshort_08.html). (""From 1494 to 1508, over 3,000,000 people \[on this island\] had perished from war, slavery, and the mines. Who in future generations will believe this? I myself writing it as a knowledgeable eyewitness can hardly believe it.”) Learn about Indigenous experiences at important times in history, like during the [American Revolution](https://nativeappropriations.com/2016/08/where-are-the-natives-in-hamilton.html), and learn about important figures in Indigenous history, like Louis Riel.
* Learn about conditions on reserves near you. Many of them suffer from widespread poverty and a lack of access to basic services, including things like clean drinking water.

The same basic principle applies with the legacy of slavery. Learn about slavery in your area--who was enslaved? Where did they come from? How did they get here? What were their experiences? Learn about specific enslaved people--try to know their names. When you went to university--did your school ever own slaves? Were any buildings in your area built by enslaved people? Did any historical figures from your area participate in slavery? When did slavery end in your area? What were formerly enslaved people's experiences like when slavery ended? How has enslavement affected this community throughout history? How does the legacy of slavery impact them now? What issues impact the descendants of enslaved people in your area? What activist groups work to fight these issues? Are there marches or protests you could go to? Read some books, watch some documentaries.

And obviously, yes, people who benefit from the legacies of settler-colonialism and of slavery should donate to charities that support Indigenous people and the descendants of enslaved people."
fosterit,fqvj9h5,t3_gkfwq0,1589678470.0,"I've been mulling over this post all day. 

I think you should stop fostering. The behaviour you're talking about is very mild in terms of what you can expect from a teenager in foster care. If clinginess, insecurity/jealousy of siblings, and relatively mild hygiene issues make a child ""beyond your capacity to care for"", then you are probably not capable of caring for a traumatised adolescent. There is really nothing you can say to your child that will change the trauma of bonding with parents who claim to love you, only to be abandoned by them. The difficulties your child already has with attachment will be made significantly worse by this event. Having subjected one child to this life-altering trauma, it would, in my opinion, be cruel of you to continue bringing additional children into your home, knowing that you are not willing to commit to them. 

You and your family are going to haunt this child for the rest of their life."

Ex_Foster,fqc7n0n,t3_gi10zm,1589251826.0,"I would have preferred to decorate my own room, but maybe not straight away--I'd have liked a few days to think about what I wanted. I'd have probably found going to Winners on, like, the second day a little overwhelming. Maybe tell them on the first day to think about what they want their room to look like, and you guys will go shopping on the coming Saturday. In the meantime, just have like a really basic room setup with stuff that can be replaced.

In terms of what food I would have wanted stocked--I was raised vegan. I would probably have wanted cantaloupe, watermelon, dried seaweed, rice, fresh berries, watermelon, broccoli, tofu, quinoa, teriyaki sauce, soya sauce, kale, almonds, mango, kiwi, peaches, plums, zucchini, cashews, and eggplant. After I stopped being vegan, I would probably have wanted shrimp, salmon, kefir, and cottage cheese, too. My favourite drink was milk thistle and barley tea. These weren't necessarily the stereotypical foods people think foster children would like. You really can't know what kinds of food your foster child will like and be familiar with until you meet them. Everyone's been exposed to and feels safe with different things. 

I would have appreciated a clearly laid out weekly meal plan, so I knew what to expect to eat each day, and which groceries were for meals and which things I could eat as snacks. I would have wanted input into the meal plan. I had certain dietary preferences and quirks--I wouldn't eat pasta or bread unless it was whole grain, and very strongly preferred olive oil over other cooking oils--that I would have wanted my foster parents to respect. I also weighed things on a food scale, because I was very particular about getting the right amount of protein. 

>What would you have told your FPs if there weren't any consequences? 

I wish you'd introduce me to people as your daughter instead of someone who was staying with you for a while. I want to love you. I wish you'd tell me you loved me. I want to stay here until I'm grown up. I want to be adopted. I want to take ballet lessons and join cheerleading. I'm scared you'll send me back. I think I need to see a doctor. I call you ""mum"" in my head. Sometimes I feel like you don't like me. I really want us to go camping, because I've never been. I worry you don't love me as much as you love your other children. I wish you'd say goodnight to me when I went to bed. I'm extremely nervous about Mother's Day. I really hate all my clothes because I didn't get to pick any of it out, and would like to replace it with new clothes that I chose. 

>What ""rules"" would you have chosen for your FPs to follow?

Besides the obvious, probably--don't get rid of a foster kid for anything you wouldn't get rid of your biological child over. Foster kids often experience being abandoned by their foster parents the same way any other child experiences abandonment by their parents. 

>What cliches do you never want to hear or see again that were overused in foster care?

I don't think I really have any. Social workers would sometimes tell me I should be more grateful (like when I was annoyed that child services wouldn't pay for the braces I needed, lmao), but aside from that, nothing really comes to mind."

Kids between six and eight are still developing their theory of mind (an awareness that other people can have feelings that are different than yours), and they might not yet be able to understand why their actions would upset you. 

I obviously don't mean to say that you're wrong to want these things--children need to be taught to clean up after themselves and to not make messes, or else they'd never learn. Just, it's probably not apathy or uncaringness on the part of your children--it's probably purely a matter of their ages and brains. I'm sure things will change when they get older.

I think that he was intended as comic relief without a lot of attention being paid to his actual psychology, but I do think he as a character comes across as mentally ill or neurodivergent in some way.

Especially because of the social power dynamics that are at play in foster care, it's wildly inappropriate to bring a non-Christian child into a Christian church.

BeautyGuruChatter,fomf7rr,t1_fomceg3,1587887842.0,"There's a megathread on the situation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyGuruChatter/comments/g7yzhi/jeffree_star_megathread/). The tl;dr on the situation is:

Jeffree Star is friends with, has toured with, and repeatedly defended Dahvie Vanity, who serially raped at least twenty-four children as young as ten years old, despite Star's own admission that he had witnessed Vanity sexually abuse children, and the claim of one of Dahvie's victims, who was eleven at the time of the assault, that Jeffree Star had seen them being abused. It's also come to light that he had inappropriate interactions with teenagers, especially his interactions with a sixteen-year-old when he was in his mid-twenties--he asked the teenager to have sex with him, said he had a crush on the teen, etc.

That's what we know for sure. There are other concerning, but less certain, things. He tweeted before going on tour with Vanity about taking people's virginities during the tour, and there were claims that he had sexual contact with a fourteen-year-old during the tour. Those claims aren't yet substantiated and the fourteen-year-old has not come forward. Vanity is not the only child abuser Star has been friends with--in the past (pre-JSC, during his MySpace era) he associated with multiple people who have since been convicted of sexual offences involving very young children."
fosterit,fomck0z,t1_folqxsm,1587885202.0,">it is a good idea to stay in an older child's room with them on the first night to help them feel more comfortable in their new home

Doooooo notttt dooooo thattttt. Like, that is such phenomenally, *bafflingly* terrible advice that I honestly think you should entirely discount literally everything that website says. Like, if they're *that* off-kilter about something (seriously, that's truly the most unhinged piece of advice I've ever heard), I would go ahead and assume that all of their advice is questionable.

In a child's first few days with you, you are a literal stranger. They don't know you. They have no idea what your intentions are. Honestly, for a lot of kids, being taken into care feels the same as being kidnapped by a stranger--except if they escape, the police will bring them back, not return them to their mothers and/or fathers. Obviously, most of the time these removals are justified, but to a kid? Their parents are all they've ever known. Children love the adults who've raised them--it's literally biological. 

When the kid first arrives, you absolutely *should not* give any kind of uninvited physical affection to them. The best, most helpful, and most comfortable thing you can do for the kids in your care is to make it clear that strong, appropriate physical and emotional boundaries will be respected in your home. You should, for example, tell the child that their bedroom is their space, that everyone will knock and get permission before entering it, and that you'd only enter without permission if there was a real emergency, like to get them if there was a house fire, or if you were worried they were sick and hurt and they didn't respond when you called out to them. You should tell them that people in your house are not ever touched in any way without permission except, again, in a real emergency, like to pull them out of the way of a car. Tell them that they can always have a hug if they tell you they want one, but don't in any way pressure them into accepting a hug. Explicitly tell them it's okay if they don't like hugs or don't ever want a hug, or don't ever want to be touched at all. 

Kids in foster care often have unhealthily loose boundaries, emotionally and physically--as is a natural consequence of being moved from home to home, and caregiver to caregiver. A lot of kids in care don't have a firm concept of their right to privacy, of their ownership of their bodies, etc. Modelling healthy boundaries is a good way to help them grow into healthy adults. Teaching a kid to cuddle, exchange 'I love you's, and share private feelings with someone who's a literal stranger isn't necessarily teaching them healthy boundaries, YKWIM? Parent-child relationships are formed over time. A ten-year-old who's meeting you for the first time won't instantaneously see you as their dad--and if you think about it, wouldn't it be really unhealthy if a kid was inclined to immediately attach to a stranger the way they'd attach to their parent? It would be a sign of disinhibited attachment, which would actually be kind of concerning.

There are a lot of ways you can demonstrate your caring for a child while still encouraging healthy boundaries. Doing practical things for them, like doing their laundry, making them dinner, and packing their lunches for school, show you care. Asking them about their favourite foods, and then making those foods for dinner, shows you care. Ask them about their favourite television shows, or what kind of music they like, or what they like to do for fun, and be clearly interested in listening to their answers. (But also, if they don't feel like talking, respect that.) Say positive things to them--""I really like \[specific detail\] in your drawing!"" ""It was so helpful how you put your plate in the dishwasher!"" ""The dog likes you--you're really good at playing with her."" ""Wow, you know a lot about \[topic they know something about\], I'm really impressed."" If they're comfortable with physical contact, give them high-fives or offer to brush their hair. Say ""good morning"" to them when you see them and ""good night"" when they go to bed. Invite them to bake cookies with you, or to choose a movie for you guys to watch together, or to come to the playground with you. (They might not feel comfortable doing those things at first, so make sure it's an invitation more than it's a summons.)

Parent-child relationships are built slowly, over time, as you *earn* the child's trust. The most valuable thing you can do for your child is demonstrate for them what it means to build a solid, healthy relationship with another human being."
BeautyGuruChatter,foks3nk,t1_fokkz4m,1587847880.0,"Remember when Jeffree Star strongly implied that James Charles' younger brother had moved out because James Charles was sexually abusing him, when in fact the kid was being treated for a mental illness?

Asha disguised herself to try to learn what kind of person this total stranger was when he wasn't playing a part. He quickly revealed himself to be a cruel, callous, violent misogynist. Asha did absolutely nothing wrong. She says herself, she ""wanted to see who \[Theon\] was first--and I did."" 

She doesn't start out trying to humiliate him. At first, she's literally helping and advising him, filling him in on things he's missed or forgotten since being away at Winterfell (like her advice about how to choose rowers for his longship). 

Asha is trying to gouge his treatment of women, and to get an idea of how he's going to treat her. She observes his terrible behaviour towards the captain's daughter, and listens to him say that he plans to force his sister to marry. She sees that it doesn't even occur to him that his sister--someone he knows to be strong and skilled--could be anything but an object to use to make an alliance with. She sees that it doesn't even occur to him that his sister might be a valuable supporters or adviser--he dismisses her before even (as far as he knows) having met her once since she was a child.

But she's still helping and advising Theon all the way up until one final moment, when he completely dismisses the idea of visiting his ailing mother, who has yearned for him.

netflix,fokfab3,t1_fok6b9p,1587840995.0,">why would Netflix take away some of its iconic Cartoon Network classics and then, of all things, add awful shows like The Powerpuff Girls (2016) to the streaming lineup?

Bud, Netflix doesn't own Cartoon Network shows. When a streaming service like Netflix (or Prime, or Hulu, or Crave, or whatever) has shows or movies on it that aren't owned by the service, it has them for a limited time--they pay for a licensing agreement, which is the legal right to stream the show or movie for a certain period of time. A licensing period is often three to five years. After that, they no longer have the legal right to keep the show or movie on its service.

Netflix wants to have as much content as possible, but they're competing with other streaming services to buy films and series for their service. When they're competing with other services to outbid them for popular shows, they sometimes lose. And it's becoming harder and harder to get licensing agreements, as more networks have begun launching their own streaming services and keeping their content to themselves.

Netflix wants as many subscribers as possible. They're a business. When they add a new film or television series, it's not because they're endorsing its quality--it's because they think people will watch it. They want to have a very, very wide range of content to appeal to as many different viewers as possible."

What I feel like some people don't understand is that a *lot* of people live paycheck to paycheck, not because of reckless spending, but because they can't afford anything beyond the essentials. I'm a first-year university student. I worked during high school, but I had no savings, because everything went to rent, medicine, and food--and even with that, sometimes I couldn't afford to eat for a couple of days, because there was just no money left. I did not spend recklessly--I wore shoes that were falling apart (literally--the sole was split), went without a coat in winter, and could never justify buying myself even a lip balm from the drugstore or a book. I grew vegetables to help bring my grocery costs down.

I lived off student loans and grants since starting university. Student loans lends you enough money to pay rent, buy food, and pay for your classes, but not more than that. I, again, live pretty frugally--my laptop is a used one from 2011, and I've never owned a new cell phone. But you can't really save when you're living off of loans. Obviously, this will be different when I'm out of school and working full-time. But these supports are needed for students who haven't been in a position to save, and who don't have families who can help support them during this time."
