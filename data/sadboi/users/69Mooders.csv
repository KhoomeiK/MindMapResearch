Anxiety,fkaygog,t3_fh8awb,1584022332.0,"100% yes its been this way for about 15 years for me. I have a few theories about myself, the first and most obvious is probably caused by isolation and lack of distraction, or when i try to distract myself I damage the quality / length of my sleep which leaves me in a bit of a bad situation. The other theory I have is that when i was first confronted with full blown anxiety / panic it was at night time and the memories / ptsd from that event linger until this day and express themselves at the same time of day that it happened.

 It has gotten significantly less bad over the years and having a girlfriend to go to bed with helps, when i am in bed I just focus on her breathing / the intimate time we have falling asleep with one another and that helps to soothe me. The other method I have for coping is listening to ASMR/White noise/ some kind of silly youtube video that isnt particularly important / doesnt have a plotline or continuing thread of thought (like a stupid lets play or something). 

Before I go to bed I limit what I do to things with little consequence such as TV (BUT NOT THE NEWS), An easy video game to play that doesnt require much attention, Reading, Drinking relaxing tea, watching youtube, meditating (headspace is a good place to start). In general just things that dont require your brain to process large amounts of information because when you go to bed your brain will continue doing that, and when you dont have distractions it will start to process shit that could cause a possible threat (if you have an anxiety disorder like mine anyway).

I also really love candles and incense, it might seem a bit girly but it works for me. 

Take care of yourself <3"
Anxiety,fk73qoj,t3_eupik4,1583926773.0,"You must be careful with the media, a couple of years ago I came back to the UK from a beautiful trip to Norway to visit my girlfriend. When I got back I went out drinking with my friends where they were joking about a situation with Russia, one was saying oh when Russia invades I hope they don't shoot me I'm Irish not English or something. I go home and and on the way I spot a newspaper with a massive mushroom cloud outside of a shop I go home to research what I had missed and I see newspaper articles with pictures of England with massive red circles over it stating these are the spots Russia is most likely going to nuke. I went down this rabbit hole for hours, everyday, searching for a reassuring headline but never found one. I ended up having a full on mental breakdown and was taken to the hospital where I was put on some serious medication for a few weeks. I still haven't recovered years later when I hear slight noises outside my PTSD convinces me I'm about to be extinguished. It is better then it was but **** me I have PTSD from an event that never happened. I dropped out of uni in the last two weeks and had to repeat a year so that the media could earn a bit of money.

 Since then I have moved to Norway where the media is 200 times more sensible and it has been an eye opener for sure, don't read anything that wants you to click on it just out of fear because the only information in there was probably slapped together in 30 minutes by some clueless twat who needs to appease his boss or his dying newspaper business would go under. 

Things like this always bring out the worst in people too, look at the whole WW3 memes that happened in January. Everyone is so quick to jump to the worst fucking outcome and even make jokes about it, unfortunately the fearmongering comes from both the people causing the fear and the people who get scared by it. Stay in this thread, don't read anything else and most importantly go and take a walk and notice that everything is the same as ever.

Take care of yourself everyone <3"

AskReddit,fgfhuzu,t3_ey7mf3,1580739168.0,"I stopped smoking because it's still illegal and the supply is shady, scary and sometimes smelt like it was laced with something. The only thing you could get hold of was skunk, It's not enjoyable it's way too fucking strong. 

I haven't smoked in about 2 years or so, I feel good. I'm enjoying life I feel no need for any kind of stimulant and I don't miss it whatsoever. I feel like I learnt how to enjoy things without needing to spike my brain with shit. 

If I had access to something a little more mild and a little more relaxed I might still smoke but considering nothing is legal or regulated you never know what you are inhaling and it's not worth the risk. On top of that I feel like overall my anxiety levels are way lower then that were day to day smoking weed"
Anxiety,ffrutd1,t3_euvwd5,1580166321.0,"You have already been to the doctor, there is no reason to be alarmed, I understand the anxiety having your throat messed with is extremely uncomfortable. The tricky thing with anxiety is that it's related to survival mechanisms and I swear anxiety has the ability to make any physical feeling you are worried about manifest itself, my uncle struggles with this, he has been to hospital many times he's convinced he's dying and every time it's the same thing just anxiety but when he goes home he focuses super hard on a feeling in his chest and convinces himself that he's having a heart attack again. I don't know if I've explained myself well, I'm half asleep haha but yes, I am positive that it's just in your head, you are probably just focusing super hard on how your throat feels which isn't something you do everyday, I'm thinking about my throat now and all of a sudden it feels tight and weird and I didn't swallow a banana :P"

Anxiety,ff75ff4,t3_es14ca,1579641480.0,"It will pass, I recommend avoiding the news as these problems are always massively overblown (remember how swine flu was going to wipe put everything) because you get worried about it and it causes you to come back over and over making them more money at the cost of your mental health. I am struggling with the same thing, It could be caused by some other stressor in your life and the news is just how the anxiety is manifesting itself in your brain. Take care of yourself, try to get outside, and try to keep away from the stories as coming back over and over will only do you harm. You are going to be fine :)"
