raisedbynarcissists,fgs27gx,t1_fgrzlbx,1581067762.0,"I want to cut ties completely eventually...

I am still living at home and am in no financial state to get my own place, i was terribly bullied as a kid for about 6 years, and during that time my mum and I became super close. (I have been diagnosed with Severe anxiety, depression and PTSD) But lately i feel like she is overly critical of me and making me feel like i am completely insane and over sensitive - she will tell me to lighten up and that life will be super tough for me if i don’t develop a ‘tough skin’. Since we have always been so close i always believe what she is telling me, but my boyfriend seems to think that everything she is saying is wrong. She makes comments about my relationship, telling me that my boyfriend tiptoes around me trying not to make me angry... she insists that she is right about everything and makes judgements based on what she sees. She insists that she is one of the only people ‘on my side’ throughout everything but will show our text messages to my grandparents to ‘show how nasty i can be’. She constantly tells me what i need and threatens to stop my therapy sessions if i don’t agree with her. She also threatens to take my car away and because I experience suicidal thoughts she threatened to throw me in a psychiatric ward on suicide watch, telling me that it goes on a permanent health record. I am at the point where i need to get away from her because i feel like she is the main cause of my depression nowadays. I cannot catch a break. I try to address things with her and she laughs in my face telling me i need to lighten up. She has literal control over every aspect of my life, right down to my clothing, she will buy me clothes and then when she says something and i argue back she will threaten to take the clothes off me.  Its made worse by the fact that she is nothing like that with my younger sister. I am just so done"
raisedbynarcissists,fgruoyw,t3_f04hfm,1581058251.0,"I have never read something so similar to my situation at home with my mum, i feel like we are in a completely unhealthy co-dependant relationship and when I try and tell her how i feel she shuts me down by giving me the silent treatment or telling everyone in my family how nasty and horrible i can be"
raisedbynarcissists,fgrub5m,t3_ezzyal,1581057851.0,"I went in for spinal fusion about 6 months ago and I am still in agony on a daily basis, my parents refuse point blank to let me see my pain specialist and said that the only reason i am experiencing the pain is because i am not doing my physio (which i am). I have pulled the argument of “i encourage you to have a pain disorder and have titanium rods and screws put in your back during a 6 hour invasive surgery and see how well you recover”"
scoliosis,ffyur8w,t1_ffsxjqq,1580355645.0,"Thank you for the information, so i was fused from T4 to L3 and I have whats called Central Sensitisation Syndrome (a chronic pain disorder). I was in the hospital for 2 weeks after fusion on two to four endone every two hours, i am mostly off the opioids now, only taking half a codeine every 6 hours, but that doesnt seem to shake the pain and neither do the anti-inflammatory medications. 

I do have a lot of radiating pain through my thoracic region including my shoulder blades. I have a lot of numbness in my back to the point where i cant seem to scratch it when its itchy, or feel any kind of sensation at all whether its cold or warm or even just touching, sometime i will experience stabbing pain like someone is sticking white hot knives into my back and shoulders. I have been given some light physiotherapy to complete every couple of days but whenever i go to stretch or complete the exercises it feels like my entire back is on fire with a burning sensation."
