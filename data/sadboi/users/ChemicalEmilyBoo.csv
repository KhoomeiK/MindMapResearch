Otherwise, my suggestion is to get the image from Amazon, crop it, and see if someone can customize a shirt and put that unicorn on it. Really wish it was available from Amazon but it's not."

I don't have anywhere tall enough to jump from. No fast moving trains. And I can't get a gun because of me being involuntary admitted. 

I hope things can get better one day. Just hate how it seems to easy for some people, yet I have a difficult time doing things to myself. I'm not afraid to die. I'm afraid of making a serious attempt again and wake up another day in worse condition than I was before. 

I hate life. I'd easily end it if I knew a sure way. Part of me wants to just drive 3 hours to a mountain and jump off. However, I'm afraid that I might somehow survive that.

SuicideWatch,f77gf28,t1_f76ease,1573455507.0,Yeah... My only fear is surviving and be in the hospital the following day. I'd do anything to not be here another day but everything I try is only another failed attempt.
mentalhealth,f6w2rz9,t1_f6w1cqc,1573214073.0,Thank you. I really appreciate it!
mentalhealth,f6vw503,t3_dt5wb5,1573203887.0,I was wondering that myself. I believe this website should be allowed and not require a password to access. Anyone know of a similar website or a way to access it? Thanks

SuicideWatch,f63qtx6,t1_f63dxj5,1572681920.0,"Same. I only work, sleep, and eat. Repeat it day by day, week by week. Usually if I'm eating then I'll watch a movie or something. I occasionally go out but not often. Too much of an introvert to want to even go outside."
