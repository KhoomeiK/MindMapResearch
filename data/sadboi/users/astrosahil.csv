 I keep on reading about people having to spend 1000's of dollars on a single healthcare issue, and always think that , I have never seen a multi thousand dollar bill except for like rent and international travel for the most part.

Some people just don't have the choice or the luxury to decide not to have the healthcare that they need or want. I guess I have been lucky so far. 

I guess I will continue to research till my appointment, and make sure my voice is heard and come out of it with positive next steps."

However, if you want to turn off emails for those, you can do that. 

Go to settings, then notifications and click the change button on the 'send spending alerts' field.

Once it expands, uncheck the field named 'unusual spending', or to be on the safe side, keep it checked but change the amount in the text field below it to something that you would want to know about.

WatchPeopleDieInside,fey3id7,t1_fey18xu,1579440314.0,"I am not one of those millennials who goes out of their way to call ageist people names. 
As far as I understand, the ok boomers meme started out as a response to people's (usually older but not always) crap assumptions about the millennial and even the z gen.

 It is not intended to be derogatory, it just stands as a two word response for 'i have tried to explain my point of view to a thousand similar people over the past few years, but since you cannot or will not listen( actually listen) to what I mean, then I'd rather not spend any energy explaining myself to you.

The person I responded to also said he is a millennial, but if you cannot understand the issues your generation is facing, what is the point of being in a good place financially, and how does it make you any different from the people who are so out of touch with today's reality.

Being practical is perfectly fine, but having empathy or at least understanding that not everyone is going to be, or can be as well off as you are, is the key point I wanted to make."

Once you get the PNR, you can login to the airline and try to figure out your upgrade eligibility as well.

If it is the one single airline you always end up using, getting it's premium card will help you attain status quicker, except for United as far as I understand.
