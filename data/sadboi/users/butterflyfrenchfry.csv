I don’t usually day trade but I had one to burn and figured profit is profit... just wish I would’ve put more down on it. I’ll think about spy puts especially considering we’re so close to 300, but I’m also holding vix calls so I’d make money either way."
wallstreetbets,fr5k8ie,t1_fr5ju09,1589909929.0,Yeah I wish I’d put more in as well. Not sure why I didn’t

wallstreetbets,fr58o4o,t1_fr5857s,1589904435.0,MSFT is annoying me. I have June calls.... It won’t go any higher for some reason. I just want it to go above $187 for like even just 1 hour. I bought June puts though too so I’ll make money as long as it doesn’t just stay flat.

wallstreetbets,fr3r8xo,t1_fr3r5fz,1589864103.0,Yeah. If you really want to do it though you’ll find a way to make it work. Find a way to make time for it every week.
wallstreetbets,fr3r15k,t1_fr3qw95,1589863943.0,Then go for it! I have an idea myself but nowhere close to having it totally plotted out and not sure how I could make it work. It’s just in my head.

But personally I love options. Yeah it’s riskier, but more rewarding to me. Options aren’t for everyone. My dad has always been really smart with money. I value his opinion, but I also think that I could potentially make a lot of money on options. I’ve struggled financially in the past so I try to be smart about it."

wallstreetbets,fr3m43q,t1_fr3lfy8,1589860452.0,"I have said this a bunch already, but I have a system in this funky market. When UVXY drops below $40 I buy calls on it. It has worked every time so far since the crash and I’ll probably keep doing it until it doesn’t work anymore."

I’ve saved so much money doing this and wish I’d discovered it sooner. I smoked cigarettes for over 10 years and kicked it almost 2 years ago... I went cold turkey for a while but now I hit the vape every now and then because I’m still addicted to nicotine."
