OkCupid,ev5is9g,t3_cibzcn,1564234393.0,"Something like:

I just moved here from the Land of Deep Dish. I do nerdy things like play various video games and make art, so luckily I'm indoors a lot in this heat. I moved here because ____.

I'm down for making friends with other geeky types .

(Get rid of music theory and learning languages because that's not really monetary based. Unless you say, Travelling to random countries and learning their language and culture.)

Beat you at: ""N64 games (whose your favorite Mario Kart character, mine is ___. I'm an awesome cook and we should have an Iron Chef battle. My specialty is ____.""

I value: (Take out ""stability"" or elaborate. Financial stability? Mental stability?)

Friday night: (Mention cat and cat's name. I dunno what RS6 is and I don't Google when reading profiles.)

Private thing: (Not liking onions isn't exciting. Maybe a childhood story that's embarrassing or funny. Or something you accidentally bought? I got humor here every time.)

Message me if: (Take out the entire kids part. Your profile already says you don't want them. Mention some personality traits you need in a partner, but NOTHING negative. Mention a fun date ide, like, ""You wanna go to the planetarium."" Or ""You wanna go to the planetarium drunk."")

(Mention a FEW favorite books/authors, comics, TV shows, movies/directors, specific foods, etc.)

Also, you are very handsome and have a very sexy smile. You also have a fan for a head in a photo. Take some casual outdoor selfies, like in front of a cool building or graffiti or laying in the grass. Ask a passer by to take a full body shot of you. Like others have said, take one with the catto. The reader already gets you're a supernerd, you don't need to keep proving it.

I hope this helps!

Good luck out there!"
