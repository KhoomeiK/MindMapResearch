If you use a romantic relationship as a means to get by while in a hole that big, it's not fair to anyone. I can't help but feel for the dude though. How the heck does one even get out of that mindset? It's a downward spiral for sure. What are his options? It's obvious that he CAN do something to change, but a large part of him just doesn't care to anymore and the small part that does recognize he's screwed isn't strong enough to help him get better."
relationships,f5zw0tt,t3_dprk9c,1572590972.0,"He acknowledged, and fully believes, he will bring you down with him. That's the problem. He believes that and because he believes this, it will happen. Why? Because his mindset can't let him see past the mental prison he just finished building for himself. Even with a record, the right mindset could have him back on his feet in a few years making very decent money. He could have all the credentials in the world and it wouldn't do him any good if he thinks his life is over and things will only get worse. His struggle with mental illness is a tough one, but it's not your burden to bear. If you want to stay alongside him, you two might try therapy, counseling, etc. If his condition is severe, he may never see the world differently and you will have to accept that the person he is now is the person he will always be. That means accepting that your role and experiences in the relationship will also be the same but will more than likely get worse. Personally, I would not stay. Personally, I say don't go into, or stay, in a permanent relationship with someone if you're not okay with the person they are NOW. From your post, I got the impression that you are walking on eggshells with him. You rather ignore the issues to avoid conflict and consequently, you have put your needs aside. That gets old fast, not to mention it's masking serious problems and giving your relationship a more ""Rosy"" feel than it might have if these problems were properly addressed. I get that he's had a hard go of it (even if self inflicted) but that's not an excuse for him or you. Don't be afraid to speak your mind. He should be open to talking with you without it turning into an ordeal. The fact that he cares about you enough to let you go is amazing. He's not guilt tripping you into staying (I hope), so think things through some more. Make a pros and cons list if you must. Can you continue living the life you have with him, putting in extra work to keep the relationship afloat and possibly get through it together or will years of the same leave you bitter and regretful if you both fail? Finally, don't be afraid to accept that it's time to go if it comes to that. Wish you the best."

""Suppressing traumatic memories can cause amnesia, research suggests"" 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/science/2016/mar/15/suppressing-traumatic-memories-can-cause-amnesia-research-suggests

I highly encourage everyone to read the article but there are a few things that stood out to me that I would like to share: 

“If you are motivated to try to prevent yourself from reliving a flashback of that initial trauma, anything that you experience around the period of time of suppression tends to get sucked up into this black hole as well,”


“Potentially this could account for the memory deficits we find in depression and other disorders too.”

 “There is a trade-off: you get rid of the memories you don’t want, but you also make your memory less effective for short windows of time.”

""The most dramatic amnesiac effect was found for the instances in which participants were asked to suppress memories both before and after the image was shown.""

""However, further experiments revealed that when participants employed thought-substitution rather than thought suppression, the unwanted memory was dodged without evidence of amnesia.""

Not sure of the credibility of the study since I didn't delve deeper, and I'm no expert, but this immediately popped into my head. The article mentions a temporary effect on memory, but is it really temporary for people who have depression (or other mental health problems) due to, let's say, abuse, and who developed memory suppression as a coping mechanism? If they have been abused all their lives, this probably means they have been supressing things, to some degree, at least everyday. So, if they go their whole lives suppressing everything before and after an abusive moment, is it really so surprising (if this research is correct) that there would be people out there that have unintentionally suppressed their whole lives? It's scary and infuriating to think about. I wish there was more research on how to reverse this, or if it's even possible. I think the worst part about trying to forget bad memories to cope with the feelings associated with them, is that even if you make them realize they are doing just that, breaking the habit can be so hard. Especially if the coping mechanism is now a go to for EVERYTHING even slightly unpleasant. If anyone has any more research on this, I would love to read it."

He also took it for a short test drive. He also mentioned replacement of the sensor, I just couldn't remember what he had called it, but I figured that if it was a sensor, I could hook up my scanner to it later and go from there. I trust the person who did the test to not lie to me if it was something that wasn't worth even purchasing and fixing. In the past I took my old car to him and he told me it had transmission and engine problems and while he said it COULD be fixed (better for him), he highly suggested against that because it wasn't worth it for me. It's on me for underestimating the problem and whether I could fix it. Is it still considered transmission failure if it's just the sensor though? Is it that bad to have a P0705 code?

Issues that might be a whole lot deeper than this post suggests. LDR can hide problems too. He's making her cry and manipulating her and they don't even live together yet. He's wielding so much power through FaceTime and it's crazy to me. This could be a big mistake that will never happen again with him though, but it could hint on what's to come. It's not even a serious issue (he just made it one) compared to the real tests couples have to endure. I don't know, I just don't want her to give herself a breather and then he goes and convinces her to keep the relationship, only to realize later it was a mistake. College is one of the greatest opportunities to meet other people your compatible with that are also around the same age.  It would suck if she wasted that for someone she should have dumped.

I hope you have a best friend, and that it's not her. I say let it wither and die. See it from my perspective: She took advantage of you for 20 yrs because she saw the people pleaser in you and knew she could treat you like crap and you would forgive her. She was right. Stop letting her be right. Another perspective: If this was a romantic relationship and she was your SO, would you have put up with it for so long? Would you take her back after she knew you were seriously considering a break up, and only under that stress would she even find it in herself to start treating this relationship seriously? No? Well, don't. As soon as you do, she will revert back and you'll be here again, with her trying desperately to make it up to you, only to stop once she's made you believe and rinse and repeat."
relationships,f4tn81p,t1_f4sna62,1571791134.0,"I agree. The only real solution is to talk to someone about it and get external help. I wouldn't suggest just putting up with it, but if she does, I've commented before with some advice for going down that path. Now that I read your comment, I'm going to suggest something that just came to mind and is probably a very unpopular opinion, and would probably just make the situation much worse long term (so OP probably shouldn't do it), but it might have its use here and there: OP, you are NOT a manipulator but have you considered observing them and learning the tricks they use on you and then using them back (or calling them out) on them in self-defense or to stand up for yourself? 

This could definitely blow up in your face OP, so it's a dangerous thing to try (at your age especially), but you can turn the tables on them and make them question THEIR narrative. Except, unlike them, instead of using lies and gaslighting you, hit them with the truth in a way that hurts and rattles them. For example, ""The only manipulators here are you guys, trying to make me believe those things didn't happen."" They might respond with, ""They didn't happen like that, you're just exaggerating! That's all you ever do!"" And you can respond with, ""See? There you both go again, trying to manipulate me. You just don't want me to tell anybody about it because you know you'll get in trouble!""

They have more experience than you OP, so this is very much a ""hey, this is a thing"" instead of ""I 100% support this and you should do it"". The reality is that the situation could devolve really quickly and end badly for you, but if nothing else, it's something to consider and learn from, even if you never apply it in real life. Heck, if you can't bring yourself to say it to their face, and for your own safety I highly advise you to think before you do, say it in your head. Use it as coping mechanism of sorts to remind yourself that you are NOT crazy. That way, you can more easily roll your eyes and mutter ""bullshit"" (even if just mentally) instead of taking everything they throw at you to heart.

If you want to think of it in an extremely positive light, when will you ever have the opportunity to observe, dissect and directly interact with people this damaged, in such an intimate way, ever again (hopefully never, unless it's a career path of sorts)? In such a twisted way, it's a great learning opportunity. I see manipulation as a much darker side of persuasion, which is a very useful skill as long as it's used for good. All of that is pyschology, so learning what makes them tick, what sets them off, how to make them happy (Don't bend over backwards for them though), what makes them laugh, what alleviates the tension in the room, can help you immensely OP. Not to mention, learning to pick up on these patterns and knowing how to respond so you can tell them to quit their bullshit, will help you immensely with toxic people that come into your life. Right now you are being taught that everything is your fault, and deep down, you won't completely stop believing that just because your parents stop telling you that. Other people in your life will gladly make you the villain if you let them. Learn to spot the behavior, stop it, and cut them off if necessary. Don't go telling them you're observing them until you can use it to your advantage."
relationships,f4tdvad,t1_f4t6omx,1571787182.0,"Depending on where she is located in the world, that may be the best (though one of the worst) options. She would basically be trading in a big chunk, if not the entirety, of her future mental/physical health, for tops five years of food and shelter. She will most likely end up with life long mental health issues as she has already considered suicide, using this approach.

Exhaust all others options first, such as seeking family counseling, moving with relatives, asking local authorities for help or calling CPS, or OP's country equivalent. If she lives in a country where it's not uncommon for children to be homeless or runaways, that may be an option, but one I would very much avoid. The amount of rape and abuse on the streets might be worse than the abuse she receives at home. If OP can't legally work yet, sustaining herself will be difficult. If the country doesn't care, she might be able to find work, but a lot of people might take advantage of the fact that she is a minor and not pay her decently, which will make finding/keeping decent shelter and food difficult. If she lives in a country where people know how to live off the land, hunt, build their own shelters, etc., that's also an option, but if she has no skills, very hard.

At the end of the day, the goal is to survive. If she has to go this route you suggest though, I would advise to spend as little time as possible at home. Think of home ONLY as the place where you go to eat, sleep, shower, etc. and try not to rock the boat. Ignore what they say and do your thing because in five years you're out OP.  Fill your day with activities to accomplish this OP. Stay late at school. Enroll in after school programs and activities if your school has them. Join a sport's club. Stay for tutoring. Anything and everything that you can handle and that will keep you out of your house longer. On the weekends, go to the library, if you have one nearby, and stay there until they close. Tell them you are researching/studying. Things that your parents can't complain about because you are doing this to keep good grades and be a good student. If they care about that, they should be fine with it and not question it too much. The plus side is if you actually study, you might improve your grades enough to get a full ride to college (in the U.S. at least). Don't tell them that though, because if control is what they want, they'll sabotage that plan. Also, ask your teachers for help to convince your parents that it really is helping you. Do realize, though, if you are in the U.S. and they suspect you are being abused or you down right tell them you are, by law they are obligated to report it. Not doing so can get them fired and put their career in jeopardy, not to mention it threatens your safety. If you choose to tell your teachers the truth OP, even if you make them promise not to tell anyone, they have no choice (U.S.), so please don't blame them.

If anyone is willing to hire OP, I suggest she start saving money and not tell her parents about it. I fear they will make her pay ""rent"" if she does. In other words, they will take most of her hard earn cash and slap her with the good ol' ""I've raised, fed, and sheltered you your whole life. It's time you start contributing around here."" News flash, parents are responsible for all of that and more until the child turns 18 (or is able to do so depending on country). She didn't ask to be brought into this world. All expenses associated with OP are her parents' problems, not hers. OP should know that she doesn't need a bank account (which in the U.S. would require parental permission). She can accept checks and cash them at a store that provides these services if nothing else. If the job pays cash, no problem there."

If you're older, you forget that a thirteen year old, while really young in comparison, knows how to read and write. That's just your average 13 yr old. Remember being tested in elementary school and some kids were already on a 12th-grade reading level in school? Some people are just really advanced. I wouldn't be surprised if OP is already college level in reading and writing. Now couple that with having grown up with technology all their lives AND being in an abusive household where the only escape might have traditionally been books, music, maybe playtime. Now give them the entire internet. They are younger and will learn faster and hold on to things better than past generations if motivated enough. To older generations, it's just a shock, and I think because we forget that children/teens are still people. They can understand things just as well as adults and know enough to express themselves. It's just, that until recently, we haven't really seen such young minors calling out for help on forums like this. It's disturbing, because this has always happened. Children have been abused like this and worse at much younger ages too, but we never heard about it while it's a happening like this. They have never had access to voice their hurt to people outside of their immediate family and social group like they do now. People who can give them a fresh perspective. Not to mention it's easier to speak up when you can remain anonymous and it's sometimes easier to tell a stranger your problems than someone close."
relationships,f4t43vn,t3_dlii2r,1571783867.0,"Dear child, the gaslighting you are experiencing is extreme.

Directly from google: Gaslighting- manipulate (someone) by psychological means into questioning their own sanity.

Wikipedia elaborates a bit more: Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation in which a person seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or in members of a targeted group, making them question their own memory, perception, and sanity.

Of course they are calling you a liar and a manipulator if you ever seek out help again. You know why? Because they want you to believe that so you WON'T do it again. They want to make you feel guilty and believe that so you won't go to an authority figure and they won't get in trouble for continuing to treat you however they like. The hardest part to know is that it's working. Forget everything they have said about you being a liar/manipulator. What they really want you to hear is this: "" That I should **shut my mouth and never speak to anyone about this**. **That I can’t call the helpline again**. "" That is their goal and they will call you every name in the book if it means keeping you quiet because they KNOW what they are doing is wrong and hopefully illegal where you are.

"" I can’t tell anyone because then I’m exactly what my parents say. A liar and manipulator who wants them gone. "" Again, no you are not. This statement tells so much and hurts to read. You CAN tell someone and that DOES NOT make you a liar and a manipulator. These events HAVE HAPPENED to you. They are making you believe that they didn't and it's working. Reporting them does not mean you are a ""manipulator who wants them gone."" It means you are a child, a minor, a human being, who is being abused and wants that abuse to stop. You want your parents to love you and treat you well. Guess what? That should be a given from ANY parent, not the bare minimum. It means you want them to start treating you better and, this is just me, perhaps have them get help. They are hurting too, and are unfortunately taking it out on you.  And yes there's a difference between discipline and abuse. Your parents slipped into abuse a long time ago.

You need help. Your parents need help. If you have siblings, they need help. It's not healthy for them to grow up in that toxic environment, even if they are not the targets. As you have mentioned, you are already needing therapy and have plotted against your own life due to this toxic environment. You are only 13.  It does not get better unless they get better. If you tolerate your abuse, you may not make it to 20, but if you do, you will be broken and in need of so much more help. You risk becoming a non-functioning member of society. Someone who just shuts down and can't deal correctly with the world around them or who has trouble regulating their emotions, actions, etc. Holding a job, having relationships, owning a car/house/renting. All these things may seem attainable but won't be because you couldn't care less or all you have gone through will make you think you are underserving and therefore it will seem impossible. Those are only a handful of problems that can develop later on in life due to childhood abuse.  If you have siblings, this can happen to them too.

I don't know what country you are from. I'm not sure, but if you are a U.S. citizen wishing to come back to the states, your closest U.S. embassy may be able to help. Contact an authority figure closest to you first about what is going on and see if they can provide assistance, but if the situation gets worse, the U.S. embassy may be able to help. I know they can handle forced marriages and child abuse, but not sure how that would work where you are located or if you are not a U.S. citizen.

I'm not sure how it works, but I'm surprised your therapist didn't say anything or were you told to keep quiet about the REAL reason you were suicidal? Maybe it's a confidentiality thing where you are, but in the U.S. therapists are required to report to authorities if there is suspected child abuse. In the U.S., we have  Child Protective Services (CPS). You can call them, but do be aware that you may be placed outside of your home if they decide you are in immediate danger. This is scary, but not a bad thing. Afterward, they would make a service plan, basically an agreement with your parents and it will be monitored for correct execution. I don't know all the details of course, but if things don't get better, never forget you have this option and should use it, if you are in the U.S. If you are in another country, maybe investigate a similar service.

Final thing that I want to address: It's okay if you just want them gone.  I'm not saying you do, but absolutely no one would blame you if that's how you felt. I think it's a natural response to being constantly abused and mistreated. Just know you ARE allowed to feel that way and there is NOTHING wrong with that. I hope all of you get the help you need, but if they choose not to change, remember, that was THEIR choice. You make yours. Wanting a better life is nothing to feel ashamed about, even if it means away from them. Best of luck and take care."

How both of you respond to counseling will probably make or break the relationship at that point and you'll know your answer with certainty. Your situation is super toxic. Unfortunately, both of you are toxic to each other. You can't help your mental illness but it doesn't justify your behavior either. If it's easier for you to leave, leave. Absolutely no one would blame you, but realize this might be what you experience in every relationship. You might gravitate towards people like ""him"" in the future and you'll be back here again. Worse, you might actually find a good person that understands but end up ruining that too. That's hard to hear, mental illness is tough, but so is reality. You can't expect someone to put up with who you are as a person because of your mental illness. It doesn't work that way and everyone ends up hurt. But you also don't have to put up with people treating you like crap just because you have a mental illness either. You might end up having to leave this relationship, but maybe take some time and get yourself more individual therapy/counseling before starting a new relationship OP.

He chose to keep it a secret, embarrassing or not, and then got mad at you for it. Had both of you talked, you could have both agreed on a gift that was free. Heck, even agreeing to FaceTime each other and enjoy each other's company would have been enough if he was really broke and you knew he wasn't trying to be cheap or didn't care.Tell him that he misunderstood and clearly defend yourself and do not apologize. At this point, don't even apologize for making him think that, because he would just flip the script. If he tries, tell him he is being down right ridiculous and you can't understand where he got that idea from. If he says from you, tell him firmly no. If he sends the presents anyway and then guilt trips you into feeling bad about dropping classes or does that but oh, wait, by some miracle he was able to find the money to keep the classes so you don't have to feel bad anymore, drop him."
relationships,f4o3oc0,t3_dkznnx,1571695985.0,"I COME FROM A HOME WHERE MY MOTHER CHOSE TO STAY. I, unfortunately, was not an only child. My brothers and sisters were born into the suffering as well. Our situation was a bit worse, but just like you, my father was controlling as hell and made my mother believe he was king. ""Allowed""? You need to realize that a healthy relationship never has that in it's vocabulary. You are not his daughter. You can do whatever you want and never ask permission. Of course, he can also react in whatever way he wants and it's up to the both of you to talk things through and set boundaries that both of you will abide by. There's no way in hell he's sticking to the same rules he's implementing on you though. If you treated him exactly, and I mean exactly, how he is treating you for one week, either he would shape up really quick or both of you would go your separate ways FAST. How long has he been going to counseling? 1 month, 6 months, a year? If it's been a few months and it hasn't helped at all, maybe switch counselors, but you can't wait on him forever. Now that you have a child, it's no longer about ""how do I make my marriage work?"" but ""What's the best thing for my child?"". This goes for him as well. If he's a good father, he will separate himself from both of you until he gets better. It's one thing for him to want to stay with you two and not know how toxic he is, but it's another thing for him to full on admit he is toxic and selfishly want both of you to live through his crap because he doesn't want to be lonely. Take it from someone who grew up seeing a shell of a mother thanks to a toxic and abusive father. You do not want that for your child. Let me be the first to tell you, he will never respect your daughter. He doesn't respect you, and legally, he has no control over you and is already making you believe he is the law. Now, imagine the way he will treat your daughter, the legal power he has over her and how that will royally fuck up her sense of reality and self worth. We are conditioned, from the day we are born, to love our parents, even if they are walking pieces of trash. As children we don't see the trash. We just see the parent and we love them because they are our parents and everyone tells us we need to love, respect and LISTEN TO WHAT THEY TELL US TO DO. No one ever sits a child down and tells them sometimes parents are bad people, until it's too late. By that time, some abused children have more or less a Stockholm Syndrome relationship with their abusive parents and trust me, that messes you up. Having to justify to yourself (and others) that yes, your father is shit, and no, you shouldn't feel guilty about it, but you can't bring yourself to just hate him and cut him off yet, is insanely difficult. Then said father hits you with ""I'm your father, I gave you life, you should respect me, I provided for and thanks to me you were never starving or homeless, you ungrateful brat, etc "" while in reality he barely did the bare minimum financially (and if anybody had bothered to call social services we would have been removed based on living conditions alone) and the times he actually raised a finger to help my mom care for us could be counted on my hands, will screw with you for the rest of your life. I don't know what you mean by him being patient with her since you mention you do all the work. Is he just playing with her? Is that what you mean? I can almost guarantee the only reason he is being patient with her is because she can't talk yet. As soon as she starts voicing her opinion, she will be treated the same way you are. He will no longer be his little girl, but someone that is out of line and needs to know their place. That's what our father did with us. The girls always got it worse though. Our dad adored the girls, until they stopped doing what they were told and started realizing what he did was wrong and going against him. All of us went from loving him dearly to realizing how pathetic he was as we got older. Some of us hate his guts, others can't bring ourselves to care anymore, and others, like me can't bring themselves to hate him completely because we can see the other side of the coin. There's no argument, he's awful and the way he's treated my mom was down right illegal, but we also know part of how he got to be the person he was. His childhood, and most of his life, was utter garbage. He was abused too, so I hurt for the little boy who went through that and came out the other side as my dad. It doesn't justify what he's done though, but it's hard not to feel pity for someone like that. Mostly though, I wish I didn't have to have the moral dilemma in the first place. I wish my mom had left, and if she talked about how he was, I wish I could just despise him. That would be so much easier. I would have probably missed having a father, but from my perspective now, I would have preferred to imagine the kind of man he was rather than knowing with certainty through experience."

So if Kate is OP, she only made herself out to be the ""victim"" of sorts and emmettiow the ""villain"". In reality, if OP is Kate, the extreme jealousy emmettiow describes stems directly from him pulling crap like going on a weekend trip with another girl, just the two of them. However, if emmettiow is OP's boyfriend, he might feel like doing that is the only way he can ever spend time with people from the opposite sex. So, both of them have issues that are making them both extremely unhappy. If they can't work it out, they need to break up bc life is too short to be that bitter towards your SO. They're just not compatible because each one seems to have extremely different boundaries and therefore expect extremely different things from each other. I also mention that if emmettiow is OP's boyfriend, he could explore relationships outside of the monogamous one he is accustomed to. Maybe he doesn't like being tied to just one person. Maybe he would prefer an open relationship. All this and any variation are a 100% fine as long as everyone he is having a relationship with knows exactly what is going on."
relationships,f4ndxaa,t1_f4m533h,1571688463.0,"That is such a good question and I would never force her to do what she doesn't want to do, but likewise she can't expect me to stand up for things that are a clear violation of my boundaries. Thinking about the conversation that would need to take place to work through us both having strong opposing feelings toward the situation makes my head hurt, lol. I mean, 15 years ago I wouldn't even have considered the possibility I mentioned, much less the one you did. Don't get me wrong, the fact that these are now questions that need to be asked is a GOOD thing and being a bit jealous of said situation is normal since the possibility is now more likely. I feel like, as a society, we are barely scratching the surface of personal sexuality and how our individual sexuality now affects our relationships with others in these kinds of scenarios. I commented based on a relationship in which both of us would be straight (which I now realize is a bit narrow minded), so if someone outside our relationship who was openly gay/bisexual suddenly made friends with said girlfriend and wanted to take her out on a weekend trip, alone, not even inviting me, then H to the E to the LL NO. Would I be a bit wary of a long time close female friend around our age if both were bisexual or only one was? Yes. It would be similar if she had a close male friend she knew since childhood. I would definitely worry a bit, but I would trust her to hang out with both alone and in return, I expect the same respect. Would I be okay with her taking a private weekend trip together, just the two of them, and not even getting an invite? No, and I would expect she would not be okay with it if the roles were switched. Why? Because they are almost the same scenario, just different genders, so why the double standards?The only real difference between both scenarios for me would be how much of a threat each one is compared to the other. Up until a decade ago, I was brought up to view same sex relationships as purely platonic but male and female relationships as romantic (and an uphill battle against society if we wanted them to be platonic). Now we are all starting to change our perspective on that and new generations won't grow up with the same mental restrictions (aka, everyone will be fair game), but there's a good chance that a female around my age who happens to be bisexual and have a close childhood friend only sees said friend, as a friend and will never see them as anything more than that. Even if they now know more possibilities exist.  Back in the day, I made friends with same sex friends and never fell in love with them because I wasn't aware that I was allowed to or that the possibility existed. So, over the years,  I ever only saw them as a friend and absolutely nothing else. Now I know I am free to marry them if I want, but those same friends don't just magically become love interests, and I don't expect them to ever be because they will always just be friends in my mind. I won't ever have, with them, that weird, split second, sexual tension that might happen between opposite genders (of the same generation) who have been conditioned to expect more from opposite genders. We won't ever become momentarily aware of each other. So in my eyes, a male friend would be more of a threat than a gay/ bisexual female, even if my girlfriend was bisexual as well, just because deep down, society is still whispering little doubts at me. A threat is still a threat though and  honestly, as time goes on, that question will be harder to answer until it isn't. Right now, we always hear about a wife cheating on her husband with another man, or a husband cheating on his wife with another woman (just check out r/relationships), but rarely (if ever) a wife cheating on her husband with another woman or a husband cheating on his wife with another man. It happens though, and as time goes on, I think that will be more widespread. Eventually, just like we have for straight relationships, we as a society will form a new consensus on what is and is not appropriate relationship wise."

The same goes for female to female relationships and family relationships.

There would never be
that brief moment where you realize and  see your male friend as a man, the same way a woman would. Even if you both went on a month long trip, just the two of you, this would never be something to consider. However, thanks to how we are conditioned to think, a male and female relationship is plagued by these things. You might think that of course it's not going to happen with her, but it might have flickered through your mind for a split second. The absurd thought, or even the temptation, would be there, but you might never act on it.

A lot of this has to do with what society dictates and each person's personal experiences. This is just from my perspective, but that first question really doesn't work yet. As a society, we are still exploring sexuality. Most people still wouldn't see a male friend as a threat to their male husband/partner. Likewise a female friend wouldn't be seen as a threat to one's female wife/partner. For this reason, we allow each other to maintain such close relationships and foster new ones well after marriage or the like.

He needs to start taking responsibility for himself and his condition, if he actually has one. He should have begun preparing his meals as soon as the fights between them showed signs of escalating. That's just common sense. From his point of view, why on Earth would he let someone he views as incompetent (he throws the food away) continue to make his meals? There is no excuse for him still getting upset. Likewise, there is no excuse for the wife to still be putting up with this. She should have told him a long time ago to start making his own meals. His condition is not her problem unless she makes it so. He has hands. 

Honestly there are choices to be made here and both of them are choosing to continue suffering. She can be supportive, but if it's making the situation worse, then stop what you are doing. Be supportive in other ways, which is hard since, if he does have sensory issues, she didn't know. She doesn't mention positive communication between them. It might be time to talk with a professional counselor if that can't be achieved. The post was absent of any positives (aside from splitting chores) so he DEFINITELY reads as abusive, manipulative and controlling person, especially to people like me who did not consider sensory issues. With that, I am not surprised people suggest divorce. I haven't seen any of the other comments where it mentions them having a good relationship, so I'll have to read those. Condition or not, he needs to respect her and she needs to respect him though. He had no right to get upset with her for cooking two separate meals (a great solution) and making her feel like she needed to start eating meat again. This is crossing a line and definitely a red flag. If she wants to continue the relationship, she needs to respect he doesn't like certain things. Unfortunately, the reason why she might be sneaking in things he does not like is because he gets upset if she makes something for herself and his palette is EXTREMELY limited and unhealthy, so what is she supposed to do, not eat? Eat a different time (doable, but really??)? Eat unhealthy? No. She should have put her foot down the minute he started pressuring her to eat meat and only make one meal. 

They're diets are on completely opposite ends. Neither should have to sacrifice their preferences, but in this case, her husband has made OP do just that. Would you make your wife only eat what you wanted, while putting her health at risk? While kind of laughable in passing, huge disagreements over diets are extremely serious, especially when one partner is forcing their (negative) eating habits on the other. ""You are what you eat"" is not just some phrase. OP struggles to watch her diet and health because her husband couldn't care less about his or hers. That's extremely selfish, by the way. Even if it was just his diet, he could be shaving years off his life (no mention of excercise) and end up in an early grave while his wife ends up a widow. Why get married if you're just going to make your wife watch you go like that while she desperately tries to get you healthy? Not to mention the toll that has on the health of the wife. There's financial costs too. When you get married, it's not just about yourself anymore. He should take better care of himself, for his wife at least. 

To me, the diet solution is simple, until, of course, they decide to start talking kids. Don't want any, well, both of them can go their separate ways diet wise if they want. Unfortunately, if they do decide to have kids, that's just one giant mess of a headache with their current situation. For starters, a parents health largely determines their future offsprings' health as well. With the way the husband eats, and if he happens to have no moderation and a sedentary lifestyle, a whole array of health problems are in his future and unfortunately can be passed down to his children. If not, his poor eating habits will definitely affect his children, and once again, will put them at risk for developing serious health complications. If he pushes his diet on his wife, you can bet he will push it on his children and then they'll be fighting about their kid's diet too. Great partner(?), terrible parent kind of thing. They can work through it though. Is there therapy of sorts for people that have sensory issues? Because his diet is NOT healthy and extremely limited. You say that she shouldn't try to feed him things he doesn't like, but it's hard to agree with that when he only has about 5-7(?) things he will eat and he gets upset when she cooks something separate for herself."

Yeah, this marriage isn't going to last, but if you keep putting up with his crap you'll probably make it to ""death do us part"".

Seriously, I can't believe you are putting up with this and I say that with all the concern in the world for you. Do you know how many people would give anything to have a wife as caring as you? To have someone that actually wants them to be the best versions of themselves and help them on that journey? Someone to be there for them with even a simple sandwich after a long day? A lot. You know what that means? You have options if he's not willing to respect you.

To be clear, he does not respect you, and unless he is a down right idiot, he does not care about your health and longevity. You don't mention his excercise routine, but on diet alone, he obviously doesn't care much about his. That's fine (not really, kinda selfish tbh), but to make you feel ashamed about your own eating habits (which were definitely healthier if done right) to the point of making you quit them, is infuriating.

I don't know about you, but going vegetarian sometimes involves a moral aspect to it. Maybe you just did it because it was healthier for you, but if you did it because you didn't like the idea of eating meat from a moral standpoint, then it's sickening to read that he shamed you into stopping. And why did he do that? Was it because you were shoving your eating habits down his throat 24/7 and forcing him to eat what you liked or go hungry? No, it was because you were considerate enough to cook two separate meals. It's because you understood that just because you have certain food preferences that doesn't mean he should have them too.
You RESPECTED his food choices and went out of your way to cook him something different. You didn't have to do that. You know what every other capable adult does? THEY COOK THEIR OWN MEALS OR HELP THEIR PARTNER PREPARE SOMETHING THEY CAN BOTH ENJOY. What does he do? He FORCES you to conform to HIS diet and makes you buy and prepare HIS food and then has the AUDACITY to complain, make faces AND THROWS IT AWAY if he deems it unworthy. What the literal hell is wrong with him? He is abusive, manipulative, controlling, etc.

Also, while his reluctance to eat new foods and his treatment of you is insane, if you want to keep putting up with his outrageous behavior and limited meal palette, I don't see why making him meals has become a problem. Realistically, if he has a small number of things he will eat, then this should make cooking for him easier, not harder,  UNLESS he expects you to be a mind reader too. Is he not telling you what he wants to eat that day? Is he expecting you to wow him and make amazing recipes out of about 5 ingredients? Is he unwilling to eat the same thing two days in a row or in the same week/month? He is a grown man and should be doing this himself, but if he wants someone else to cook using only 5 freaking ingredients, he should have all the recipes he likes down and ready for you to use. At this point in his life, if he doesn't have a clue what he wants to eat that day with such limited tastes, then why the hell should you slave away then?

I strongly suggest you stop pampering him. He should be the one cooking, he should be the one planning, he should be the one shopping and he should NOT be getting upset with you for wanting to eat something else, especially when you're the one making it! 

If you want to keep this marriage, both of you need counseling, ASAP. Talk to him about your concerns first, of course. Remember, good communication is key. Although he doesn't seem like the type who will listen but at least he can't say you didn't try.

Never forget that you are a beautiful and educated woman that can do so much better than him right now. If he doesn't want to become a better version of himself, do not continue to settle for him! He is literally dragging you down and his demands are making it difficult for you to keep a healthy lifestyle. I obviously don't know your entire relationship dynamic, but just from your post today, I feel like you settling is how this marriage came into existence in the first place. Thinking back, there had to be red flags. Did you two marry before living together, because if you lived with him prior to the marriage, it's hard for me to think that this behavior was not already present. 

At the end of the day, the problem that is tearing your marriage apart is not that he's a picky eater. It's that he treats you like crap, he's abusive and controlling, and that you are fighting because YOU DON'T LIKE BEING TREATED LIKE THAT. If you haven't noticed, you are NOT the problem. HE IS."

relationships,f49jurv,t1_f48xls0,1571469956.0,"Right? I mean, the whole situation is kind of weird but responding by bringing your own food and not sharing is petty, in my eyes at least. It literally reminds me of children not wanting to share their lunch.  Communication is key in all relationships. They might have a good reason for why they continue to do this. That reason might not make sense to OP, but that's why they should talk about it. Don't just be passive aggressive about it because you risk escalating the situation. If OP thinks they are being cheap by charging them, but his colleagues don't, then I wouldn't be surprised if his colleagues turned on OP and called him cheap and petty for not wanting to contribute his share when everyone else has. If they are more friends than acquaintances, I'm pretty sure they will understand if you talk to them OP. If they don't change the behavior, maybe reach a compromise of sorts. If they still don't, well, it all really boils down to how much you are willing to let this slide in order to keep the relationship. Depending on their reasoning for continuing this behavior, and their reaction to your discomfort, you should be able to gauge how well you are respected in this situation OP. And yes, it does seem unfair to me that they continue to do this to OP. After you gauge how you are treated, again, it boils down to whether or not you want to continue being treated like this or if you are willing to sacrifice a bit of unease to keep the friendship. Maybe reevaluate the whole friendship. Did you become friends out of convenience and because they just happened to be there you continue the relationship, or is it a much deeper bond? I find that little instances like the one OP mentions are not isolated, but ARE usually ignored to maintain the friendship either because they really care about the person and in the grand scheme of things it really doesn't matter to them or because they let people walk all over them. Either way, talk to them about it."

You are right to be upset for him suggesting this and especially if he continues to pursue this idea when you have clearly communicated it upsets you. However, depending on how open both of you are about everything in your relationship (emotions, needs, sexual fantasies, etc.), I would approach the situation with a clear head. If both of you have cultivated a relationship where you can share it all, you can't be upset with him for doing just that. You can hate the idea, but not him for having shared it if that is the kind of relationship you have built together. If this isn't the kind of relationship you have, but wish to have, you both have to listen and respect each other. Don't shame him for it and don't let him pressure you into doing what you are not comfortable with and feel would destroy the relationship for you. Communicate with each other and don't let things and emotions just simmer. Let each other know what your boundaries are and what you both can explore together and what would be dealbreakers for each."

Yeah, that's not being helpful. That's being an asshole. You losing weight is for you and your health, NOT for him and his pleasure. 

""I felt like I was finally at a place where I didn’t hate my body after years of feeling disgusted by myself. It just feels kinda endless.""

It's endless because he's still there. 

If you can work things out, great. Talk to him and tell him actual ways to be helpful (ex. Excercising together, eating healthy together, etc.). His reaction to your concerns and suggestions will say it all. If he feels awful that he made you feel that way about yourself, apologizes sincerely promising to stop those remarks and is all for going on this journey with you, rejoice, there's hope. If, however, he shrugs/laughs your concerns off,  and tells you anything along the lines of ""you're weight loss is your problem, not mine, why should I have to excercise and eat healthy with you?"" or ""I say those things to encourage you and I don't plan to stop"", then walk. You might love him for him, but he only loves you when you're skinny if that's the case, and well, that isn't love. Your beauty will change. Sometimes you'll weigh more, other times you won't. Life is going to happen and your looks will fluctuate. If my SO told me what he told you above, I don't think my doubts about our relationship would ever end. Will I be dumped if something happens and I end up chunkier? What about after we have kids and can't always prioritize ourselves first? Will I be cheated on if I'm no longer attractive?

Doesn't want your social circles to intertwine? Gee, I wonder why? He's willing to break up with you at the mere mention of the possibility, BEFORE you even move there? That sounds like he's protecting whatever investment he has going on over there and hoping if he breaks up before you move there, that in itself, will deter you from going there in the first place and accidentally ruining whatever relationship he may be cultivating there. In other words, he breaks up with you, and you think it so painful now YOU don't want to bump into HIM so you'll stay away from him, that city/area, and whoever else he might be with. That's all speculation of course, but if it's not an infidelity issue, then, honestly that might be worse. Long term, it's a disaster. Do you plan to ever get married and live together? Start a family? Does he plan to keep you alienated from his friends forever and if you ever want to hang out with all of them he'll threaten breaking up or divorce? It doesn't make sense. As of now, that so manipulative AND controlling. Now imagine being married. You obviously don't like it now, I can't imagine what he would make you give up on if you were married. Honestly, all the possibilities that come to mind (infidelity, controlling/manipulative behavior, him doing something illegal he doesn't want you to know like drugs, mental illness?) are all red flags and things you are not in any way responsible for or should have to tolerate. I can't think of one good reason why he would be this adamant about this. Everyone needs space, but this? Come on. OP, if this is just a glimpse of the kind of person he is and your relationship (as in, it gets worse) you can do sooo much better. I would sign the lease, break up, and if you do bump into him, just remind yourself why you won't be doing THAT again. On the other hand, if he just happens to read like an asshole today only, and he's actually not scum to you and a surprisingly good bf, I'd suggest counseling.

relationships,f1ttlj2,t1_f1tonms,1569749803.0,"Lol, he did. It's what it boils down to. And you're right, he never has, so why make a big deal about it now? It's a hurtful statement to make. And yes it was hurtful. She was hurt. You don't get to tell her it isn't hurtful. It was a crass statement that served no purpose. She can not control her period, just like if she had a health condition that flared up it would be out of her control. It's so disrespectful. 

Of course, relationships have dynamics. If you're in one and you're okay with being talked to like this, maybe playfully or both of you aggressively talk like that, she isn't (obviously) and doesn't appear to have that dynamic. If he's dealing with something, that's not on her. That's not her problem, so he doesn't get to take it out on her and doesn't get a pass for messing up and then acting like HE was hurt. If he really didn't mean it, he could have apologized. He didn't. It's not making a drama out of nothing. It's one thing for him to have made that statement, apologized when he realized it upset her, and both talk about it, and is another to make that statement, never apologize, make her feel guilty over something she can't control, and then ignore her when she's trying to mend the relationship. Which, of course, she shouldn't have to. She didn't do anything wrong. That's not drama about nothing, that's a red flag. Isolated, maybe, but from other comments from OP, there seems to be more."
relationships,f1tq9xj,t3_dap9j9,1569748205.0,"Honestly, from what you wrote, I'm inclined to believe he's innocent. I mean, as others have said, you want proof. Make sure it's not fabricated either. Foxes be crafty, lol. But seriously, the proof should be solid, and not just hint at the possibility of an affair. If texts, make sure they are the real deal, not photoshopped. While probably time consuming and/or expensive, technology does exist where faces of people can be swapped onto other bodies and make it appear as if they are doing the deed on video.  You know you're husband's body best, so if she pulls something like this, remember to focus on all details, not just his face. If still unsure, there are professionals who know how to spot fakes. And you shouldn't feel bad about wanting proof. Your husband might feel bad about it and claim lack of trust, but sometimes trust doesn't mean much if the person is a good liar. Not to mention the health repercussions to you and your children if it's true. And, there's also the fact that if you just leave it, it might  eat you up and could actually ruin your marriage. Your husband might also want to talk with someone over the legal repercussions such claims can land him in and what he can do to protect himself. If she is indeed a ruthless women intent on revenge, all she needs to do is accuse him of sexual harassment or, God forbid, rape. After that, forget losing his job, he could be facing jail time.

relationships,f1tkbcr,t1_f1sqc6z,1569745627.0,"Full stop right there. SHE didn't create this situation. HE did, then he made it worse. He was a jerk when he literally demeaned her for having a period and then continued to be one. Do you not understand how disrespectful, and hurtful, it is to hear that from a SO over something you cannot control? Imagine this wasn't her period and was suffering from a painful medical condition that flared up and prevented sex at the exact moment the trip was planned. How much of a fool do you have to be to make your girlfriend feel bad about something she didn't want to have, can't control, and will spend most of her life managing? Had it been a medical condition, I wonder if you would still ""LOVE TO SEE THIS FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE"" and if you would, whether you could support that view. He shamed her for being a woman. In no way is that ""SLIGHTLY bummed"". He might have said it in a playfully annoyed tone, we don't know, but it was obviously not received well and a cheap comment to make regardless.

You must know there are things you think, and then there are things you say. You might not be able to help a certain thought, but you CAN help speaking it. Honestly, I can understand him being visibly disappointed (which is confusing considering OP said he hasn't minded before) but how could he let those words come out of his mouth? Communication is great, but that served absolutely no purpose. What did he expect would happen? She would stop? Apologize for it? Be happy to hear it? No. The only thing those words could have done is hurt and upset her, especially if they were said seriously and without jest. OP's boyfriend had no right to say that to her, and if he thought he said it harmlessly, he should have apologized as soon as he noticed she didn't see it that way. OP noticed that her boyfriend already caught on that she was upset. He chose not to apologize for it as soon as he realized, ended the call knowing she was upset, and later, as OP's post heavily suggests, was upset that she, rightfully, didn't want to talk to him. 

Now let's assume he had no idea why she was upset. I honestly believe he cannot be that dense, but all right. He could have asked what was up during the initial call, he didn't. From OP's post, he tried calling afterwards, received no answer and  then he drastically cut communication with her. Did he forget texting exists? A quick, ""Sorry I upset you. Talk to me when you're ready"" would have sufficed. He's the one that messed up, not her. Again, if he can not grasp why she is upset, it's probably in his best interest to wait for her to reach out first. If he can grasp the severity of what he did, he needs to grow up and realize he doesn't get to be upset here.  His actions directly led to his SO feeling upset, which he did notice, and chose not to address. Him being upset, because OP was VERY upset over something immature and hurtful HE said, is beyond ridiculous. It's down right childish of him to expect victim points here. OP very rightfully needed time to calm down. OP's boyfriend, did not. In this situation, OP's boyfriend needed to be the more understanding individual this time, not OP. Why? Because the boyfriend messed up big time. 

OP very clearly states his communication behavior drastically changed. Hers didn't. The post is what we have to go on and from it we see OP was mature enough not tear him a new one then and there. She gave herself time to calm down and reached out to him same day in her usual fashion. Now, while the boyfriend had no right to be upset, no one can stop him. Let's say he also needed a few hours. Okay, fine. Except he didn't take a few hours. He took days. He reversed the roles. You say maybe he's trying to give her space? That implies respect. Being curt with her, ignoring her and changing his attitude negatively towards her, that's not respect. Not to mention this whole thing started because of how disrespectful he was to her in the first place. He has no cards to play here. Even if he's not ignoring her for that, he shouldn't be ignoring her at all if he is upset with her over anything for this long AFTER he knowingly messed up. Especially when OP is actively trying to communicate as she always has. 

And yes, OP clearly states she knows he is upset with her about something. Not sure what it is of course, could be this, but definitely something. Now, you say that the only way to find out is to ask him so he can tell her. Not true. People lie, play it off, ignore it to avoid dealing with the situation. That is why body language, facial expressions, tone, etc. are so important. Combined, you get the full picture. Know someone long enough and you pick up on individual things and what causes certain reactions. Don't believe me? Well, if you own a pet long enough, you'll get to know what they are okay with and what they don't like. The kicker? They don't even talk. Not the way we do, and yet we understand when certain things make them happy or upset. Same thing applies here. The behavior of OP's boyfriend didn't slightly change, it drastically changed. She's known him for a while, so it would be ridiculous to think she doesn't have a clue when her own boyfriend is upset with her.

Also, your words: ""Do you not see that maybe a guy, who is broke, in which they both live with their parents might be SLIGHTLY bummed out about not being to have sex in a nice hotel that two BROKE people spent money on? They're in a long distance relationship for crying out loud.""
Did YOU forget she is part of the ""both""? That ""both"" are in a long distance relationship, ""both"" have needs, ""both"" are broke and that ""both"" paid money to make arrangements? Yet somehow, only HE made a big deal about the sex and completely ignored everything else about their relationship? And before you misinterpret, HE WAS the only one who, on HIS OWN, decided it would not work. From her post she was cool with it. She could have said there was no way it was happening, which she had every right to say without him getting upset, but she didn't. She had more right to be upset here than he ever will. She was looking forward to this, too. They planned it together after all (although her post suggests she did most of that), yet HE right away starts suggesting they cancel just like that? Again, if all he put down was money and arranged his own schedule to fit while she did all that plus the actual trip preparations, how is he going to just suggest that? That's disrespectful to her and her time. Even if they went 50/50 on everything, is her half of the effort going to get tossed just because he deemed her ""unfit""? Not to mention there could be penalties for cancellations that BOTH OF THESE BROKE people will have to bear. 

There's a lot we don't know. Of course there is. For all we know he is the most amazing person in the world to her, who, unfortunately messed up really, really, bad, just this once. No one knows that but OP. However, all we have is the post to go on and her boyfriend reads like an asshole and his behavior as a giant red flag. Unfortunately, no amount of past ""goodness"" excuses his actions here and is why you won't find many sympathizers. Even if we can understand the ""why"" it doesn't make it right. Just because you can see both sides doesn't mean you'll agree with both. This red flag could be the tip of the iceberg for OP that reveals other problems about the relationship, or it might be an isolated incident. Either way, her evaluating the relationship will either end it or strengthen it."

Not to mention, unless I missed it, not once did he apologize for his behavior. Instead, he made it HER problem to deal with HIS attitude because HE made a mistake. Talk about manipulative. He has her over here questioning herself, and if she were a different person, he'd have her begging him for his attention, which he's choosing to restrict instead of apologizing for his actions.

personalfinance,f1s125a,t1_f1rzf7v,1569722778.0,"Also, can he get a replacement title if he never had it titled to his name to begin with? I know the vehicle had a title, but I'm assuming he never transferred it to his name, so would he be able to get a replacement? Would a replacement cost less than the $200? I guess he could just have it titled to his name anyway, pay the $200, and have that added to the sale price? Or, as a buyer, would you just expect him to eat the cost since it should have had a title to begin with?"
personalfinance,f1s04rm,t1_f1ryqp3,1569722433.0,So opting out of purchasing the title and tags after paying off the vehicle IS an option with dealerships?
personalfinance,f1rzqgo,t1_f1ryofg,1569722287.0,"DMV, right? And is there anyway they could miss something? I remember reading once that sometimes the DMV takes a while to process things, so you might get the all clear and then later on find out there are problems?"
personalfinance,f1rzf7v,t1_f1rym8m,1569722174.0,"This is what I'm wondering about and was thinking if it's true, then he should have no problem going with me to the dealership and then the DMV to be a 100% sure, right? Or is there still risk even if they both give the all clear?"
personalfinance,f1rz2b5,t1_f1ryizn,1569722042.0,"Wait, then how would I know? And how does the dealer not know he stopped paying them? Unless you mean he used the car for collateral on something else? Sorry, I don't know much about dealerships in general, so not sure how it all works."

MechanicAdvice,f1nnk3h,t1_f1nj488,1569621375.0,"I'm not quite sure. I'm assuming that's what causes the thrust? I haven't personally gone to see it since it is a drive and didn't want to waste gas/time unless I was certain. I knew it might need repairs, but I'm not looking to replace/rebuild a whole transmission."
MechanicAdvice,f1nmoms,t1_f1nkzbu,1569620740.0,That's what I thought but didn't know enough to be a 100% about it. Thanks!
Flipping,f1nhkam,t1_f1i1qbc,1569617438.0,Have your experiences been good ones? What steps did you take to avoid being scammed?
Flipping,f1ngyjj,t1_f1g24b7,1569617032.0,"Wow, I did not know that was possible. So even if you take every precaution when it comes to these it could still blow up in your face later. Noted and thank you."
Flipping,f1ngn28,t1_f1gdi1a,1569616817.0,"Haha, I've definitely have considered that moped, but where I live it might just get me killed faster, especially driving at night."
relationships,f1lxgb5,t1_f1lanyb,1569574564.0,"Well the thing is, it depends on the mistake. Accidentally break a window or accidentally injure someone, and yeah, you didn't mean to, so forgiveness from others might come quicker. Intentionally abuse your wife and almost kill her, and, as you can tell, most people are not willing to let that slide. Not to mention she is taking a huge gamble with her life and kids by staying with him, while the alternative is simply not to. The most important thing though? You're not entitled to anyone's forgiveness. No one is. People can choose to forgive. They don't have to."
