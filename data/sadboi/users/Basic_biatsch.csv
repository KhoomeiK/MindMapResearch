What youre doing Is the opposite of what historians should do because you took something and made it a fact, instead of observing and giving multiple ideas such as a) in the 19th cent., males tended to have similar views on the female body as this UNKNOWN poster b) However it was women for the most part who held very strict regime towards their bodies that was not to be deviated from.
