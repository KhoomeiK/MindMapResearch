He needs an MRI and a neuro-psych test as soon as possible to weed out what is going on here. 

In the meantime, I agree with the posts above that you need your own counselor to deal with this situation. I know he is the one with the issues, but a good therapist will help get you through this tumultuous time. At this point, please focus on yourself and your children. Your husband surely needs help, but if he is refusing his medication and not doing anything to help himself, it’s the old saying “you can only lead a horse to water” that holds true here. If his own lack of being able to deal with his medical issues are leading him down this dark path while potentially causing irreversible damage to his central nervous system, then that is his own doing.

If that is the case, you may want to start off by getting a different GP.  Ask around because not all doctors are created equal, so to speak. Make a bullet point list of your symptoms, and then give that paper to your new GP and insist on seeing a new neurologist. I definitely say that writing ALL of your symptoms down, even the fleeting ones, is crucial. Sometimes in the moment when we are face-to-face with a medical professional, we forget what we need to say or forget an important detail. Work on your list and don’t leave out anything at all. I’ve done this many times, and it helps me tremendously. 

Sadly, I had been written off too for various medical issues, and all of them ended up being serious issues. Not all MS related, but I’ve had enough medical issues that I know it can be difficult as a young person to get doctors to hear you and take you seriously. Be direct and to the point. It’s okay to insist on a test or to insist that you need to be taken seriously.

Please remember that the modern DMT therapies can keep a lot of MS subsided. They aren’t 100%, but modern medicine has great DMTs for MS, and as time goes on, better and better meds will come out."

MultipleSclerosis,f95qmbx,t3_e3ygfa,1575133394.0,Ask for the Copaxone patient access paperwork. A patient rep from the pharmaceutical company will handle all of that stuff for you and your physician.
MultipleSclerosis,f951wo6,t3_e3cvtt,1575116020.0,"I had a severe case of Bell’s Palsy in December 2016, and darn it, I never made a full recovery. I have something called synkinesis, which is where the nerves in the face basically re-wire to the wrong muscles and tear/salivary glands. It’s horrible. Anyway, a lot of doctors believe that Bell’s Palsy is caused by the herpes virus, but again, it’s all in theory. 

I was diagnosed with MS in November 2019. Is it possible that the same herpes virus that potentially caused my Bell’s Palsy also caused my MS? I’m now really starting to wonder if there is a possible connection here. 

So many doctors tell me that the BP and MS are not related, but this is making me wonder now if they are wrong."
MultipleSclerosis,f94h980,t1_f94g2j2,1575088231.0,"You must have really seen the uptick in treatment over the years. I hope after almost three decades that your symptoms are still manageable, and I hope your quality of life is good. I know MS is such a wildly unpredictable beast of an illness."
MultipleSclerosis,f949qmr,t1_f9472vp,1575081569.0,"Absolutely, and I always remind myself that the MS drugs are going to get better and better as time goes on. I have a strong suspicion that once a definitive cause of MS is proven, the sky will be the limit. 

And yes, ItalianPizzaGuy, to all those who were on the short end of the stick with receiving a placebo pill, I am forever grateful because to me, you are all true MS martyrs and our unsung heros, and that’s for damn sure!"
MultipleSclerosis,f945f50,t3_e3drsv,1575077885.0,"I get nightmares, but I also have PTSD.  Not sure if my nightmares are from that or MS. However, if this continues to happen, maybe go online and get a night video recorder to see yourself on camera.  Or, get a sleep study done."
MultipleSclerosis,f944vhi,t1_f944r2c,1575077422.0,"You as well! I was diagnosed 3 weeks ago and went right for the good stuff, and I slept through most of it, thanks to the Benadryl. No reactions or itching, so I’d say it’s a win."

MultipleSclerosis,f8zlmz3,t1_f8xb362,1574962065.0,"You just made me cry happy tears! I am SO glad to hear that you are not just living, but thriving. I have been really sick for about two years but wasn’t formally diagnosed with RRMS until about three weeks ago. I woke up today for the first time without brain fog in gosh knows how long. I’m already feeling markedly better too. 

I was about to give up on my dreams until I learned a few weeks ago that 1. I have MS and 2. That it is treatable. I’m a 41 yr old female, and believe me, there is a lot I still want to do with my life. 

Cheers to you for many, many more great years to come. Thank you for sharing this most inspiring story."

I’m really glad to hear you are doing so much better. Thankfully, MS drugs are coming a long way in the past 10 years, and no doubt they will continue to improve."

MultipleSclerosis,f8wn7tu,t1_f8whnsv,1574894777.0,"Nope. I didn’t feel any burning today, but everyone is different. The Benadryl made me sleep like a baby though. I was out cold for most of the infusion."

MultipleSclerosis,f8u49hu,t1_f8u2g2h,1574818837.0,"Thank you for your insightful response. I’m an emotional mixture tonight of being both excited and nervous, but I’m definitely ready to bring action against my RRMS. I was finally officially diagnosed about a month ago, and my MS diagnosis explains a lot of how I’ve been feeling these past two years. If the Ocrevus will bring back some normalcy in my life, then I’m certainly welcoming of this drug. 

How have you felt in general? I’ve heard incredible stories of people having healing lesions and whatnot, so I can’t wait to see what my final outcome is from this DMT."
MultipleSclerosis,f8u0yjg,t3_dzkfl8,1574816300.0,YAY for you! I’m getting me first 1/2 dose tomorrow. Ocrevus power!

ptsd,f6rarce,t3_dsrhu2,1573098163.0,"Don’t try and fit yourself into a box. My childhood was very mixed too, and my issues really began in 5th grade. My parents were great in many ways yet also not great in some ways. 

Here is the thing: if you feel you are undeserving of help because of some mixed feelings about your childhood or that it could have been worse, then you are denying yourself your own life experiences. Everything in life can be worse, but it can also be better. 

As children, we internalize and cannot effectively communicate our feelings. What adults see in a situation and what children see in a situation are very different.  Don’t be so hard on yourself. Trauma is trauma."
ptsd,f5zedv4,t3_dnnasr,1572574713.0,"Not sure why EMDR would be more expensive than the therapy you are already getting. My EMDR costs the same as cognitive behavioral therapy. 

Can you see a psychiatrist and get some medicine for a while until you can get EMDR therapy?"

relationship_advice,f4p39ie,t1_f4niq35,1571714776.0,"Absolutely. 

She plotted this for months, thought about it, and had every opportunity in the world to say to herself, “This is wrong, and I’m not going to do this.”

Instead, she stuck her fingers in her son’s piggy bank, stole what wasn’t hers, and locked up the money in a car that she obviously had no business purchasing. 

Hey OP: do a police report and hire an attorney ASAP. Close your bank account right now, and open a new account with just your name on it so the sticky-fingered lady can’t get anymore free cash from you."
relationship_advice,f4p2g88,t3_dl02bm,1571714157.0,"Do these following things before the end of the week:

1. File a police report for theft
2. Close your old bank account and open a new one
3. Hire an attorney. Are you in the US? If so, there is usually a law about stealing financial assets from minor children. 
4. I would keep all communication from your mother cut off until you speak with a lawyer. 

Your mother sounds horrific, and I’m putting that mildly. She basically used you as her own personal savings account, and I would absolutely call an attorney without hesitation.  She will probably be forced to give up the car and reimburse you every penny she stole from you, and also reimburse by any legal fees associated with this case. 

Remember: she did this, not you. This wasn’t an accident on her part as she had months to plan this, months to back out her scheme, and yet, she chose this plan of action regardless. She plotted this, and she plotted taking advantage of her own son. Do not let her guilt you into feeling sorry for her."
ptsd,f4b9o31,t1_f0wg0td,1571509011.0,"Yep. Same here. C- PTSD from ongoing trauma in 5th/6th grade. I was officially diagnosed 2 years ago and am now in EMDR therapy, which is helping."
