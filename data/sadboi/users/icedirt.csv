In 2010 it was altered and brought more stakeholders on board, resulting in lower catch and higher revenue for those involved. It also highlights that it is not necessarily just poorer countries that struggle with regulation. I will also remind you that the north atlantic cod fishery that collapsed in the nineties is off the northeast coast of the USA-meaning the likely culprits were the USA and Canada. Here is the wiki page. 

 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnuson%E2%80%93Stevens_Fishery_Conservation_and_Management_Act

Another common difficulty with regulations is that whatever biodiversity you see growing up is what you think is normal, as explained in this article. 

https://www.newscientist.com/article/2226898-young-people-cant-remember-how-much-more-wildlife-there-used-to-be/

So a lot of people will not realize the biodiversity loss because they don’t remember what it used to be like. If you track abundance of nearly every wild species, it has been in a downward trend for literally decades. 

I get it, we all want a strong economy and it is easy to see regulations as the enemy. But lack of regulations cost us the passenger pidgin, the Carolina parakeet, the north atlantic cod fishery, sustainable salmon fisheries in the pacific northwest, and much more. If you look at the data-collected by universities, citizen scientists, private companies, and everything in-between, we are headed for ecological collapse nearly worldwide.  If you don’t trust those sources, ask old fishermen how things have changed for them in terms of what they are actually catching. Not what they are allowed to catch, but where they have to go in order to get the same volume of fish. Here is an inland example: my great grandpa caught salmon out of an irrigation ditch that is several hundred miles upstream of where you can catch salmon today in the same watershed. 

The economy is a distraction from a slow and very real apocalypse. Lifting regulations on what you are allowed to catch won’t help much when there are no fish left in the sea."

Edit: for all of you downvoting, here is a good quote about it from the article:

“Michigan is an open-carry state, however, and there are no rules barring people from bringing guns into the Capitol.

""It's always been on the books — even before the last constitutional convention — the right to open carry in Michigan,"" Sgt. Jeffrey Held of the Michigan State Police told MLive.

‘We just worry about damaging the walls, because on the decorative paint, a sign turning the wrong way or even a rifle can gouge the thing,’ Steve Benkovsky, the Capitol facilities manager, told the outlet.”

Despite what you may think, I am not advocating for their behavior-just pointing out that it is 100% legal. I live in an open carry state and while I do find it scary, I also find it eye-roll worthy. If you feel the need to carry a gun into the capitol, it is unlikely you will be killing anyone with it and it is an empty threat. It’s like me holding blanket over my head  to feel better. These people likely want to defend their second ‘murica rights, and know nothing would remove them faster than an act of violence. If you live in a state that is not open carry, this may seem scarier than it is, it really is just posturing. Scary, but ultimately posturing."

I downvote because it is a lazy word to use.

Life,fov5ecf,t1_fospfe2,1588095661.0,"I get what you are saying. You don’t have shelter. So you want to rent a house. You are now free from rain but have to keep making income to pay for that freedom. In other words, material wants can be unlocked by money. You have as much freedom in society as you can purchase. I want to have a cat and a dog and a house. I cannot go into the woods and do this legally, and I could lose freedom of movement if I try to do so and get arrested. But, if we didn’t pay to enforce these laws, we would lose the forest to other people with the same ideas, and everyone would lose the freedom to walk in wilderness. The shackles on all our hands, paid for by taxation, means the forest stays free. 

Let’s say you have these material goods and want to keep them, you are imprisoned by needing to make money. If you own land but can’t make the money to keep it and also to have good food, you either lose your land or you are stuck eating crappy food forever. You have good health insurance and can pay for food and gas as long as you have money. Money allows you to have these things, right? So no matter what I do, I will have these freedoms-as long as I am selling hours of my life to another person. I literally have to sell my lifetime to have access to money. People willingly imprison themselves for decades i order to retire and maybe have 5 years of freedom from work right before they die. To have “freedom” that is bought, I sell the only thing we all have a limit on:time. 

If I have a job that pays the bills and that’s it, literally just shelter, food and water, I have no real freedom because I cannot afford to quit my job and find a better one, I cannot afford classes to improve myself, and if I am working more than 50 hours A week, it is unlikely I will have the time to truly invest in doing any of the free things available that could help me improve myself and get a better job (studies show people can’t properly take care of themselves and their home if they work more than 30 hrs a week. Individual limits vary). I am trapped. These are the shackles I am talking about. Some of them are psychological, some are real. In the US we have a lot of programs designed to help. If I quit my job or otherwise lost it, I could get unemployment and food stamps. But that isn’t necessarily going to be enough, and I am still stuck knowing that if I don’t get a job money, I will either find friends who can help, find a job, or be homeless and starving once those helpful items run out. 

Arguably the answer here is that money can free you from these problems. But arguably these problems wouldn’t exist the way they do without our current economic system, and money. For instance, people know that if you build big houses on expensive land, you can sell them for a lot of money. But not everyone can afford that. Furthermore it increases local property values. Good right? More money? But it causes upheaval. People who have lived their entire lives in one home in my state are being forced out of their homes due to increasing home value-again, a money issue-that means they have to pay more taxes than they ever planned to when they retired. Money forces them to leave. It did not free them. It freed their home to be sold. It allowed another person the freedom to buy that home, and have a nice place to keep them safe from rain. It means the old owner must move. Theoretically they will have enough money to do that after the sale, but my point is that the sale was involuntary. Money put a lead, shackles on the old owner, and forced them away from their home. Does it matter that you were compensated if it wasn’t something you wanted to part with?

Money is just another word for power. Whether it is something that frees you or chains you depends on what your position is. He who controls the wages controls the workers. They are not truly free."

/s

That’s what you sound like to me. Get a grip. Denying any group of law abiding US citizens the right to freedom of movement, and keeping them out of your neighborhood via discriminatory religious laws is against our constitution. We aren’t talking about recent immigrants here. There are millions of natural born muslims in the USA. other nations have nothing to do with it. Wisdom is learning from past experience. However, greater wisdom is learning from past experience with context. I’ve heard it before-people are all “ooh that group of people is bad! More crimes!” Until I say “hey! I, the person you are talking to right now, am part of that group!” So they reply “well, of course we don’t mean YOU, You’re fine. We mean some of the other people in the same group.”

Honey, if your law keeps out the bad, it also keeps out the good. If your law keeps out people that include me, it doesn’t matter that you like me as an individual. The law doesn’t care about me as an individual. 

Can large groups of people moving into an area change the culture and demographics and cause social upheaval? Yes. It is happening now. It happens all the time. By your logic, Idaho should have made it illegal for anyone from California to move in years ago. We were just fine, then all them Californians came in and are trying to prevent other people that they don’t like from following. And here you are defending it. I would agree on some level that it is a rational reaction. I would also say it doesn’t matter because on a deeper level it is unjustifiable. Where has a recent immigrant group successfully formed and maintained a true theocracy in the USA? Unfounded fears are a poor basis for law. And this need to control others is hypocrisy for a group that supposedly just wants left alone."

AskAnAmerican,fo3n02p,t3_g5dzup,1587489617.0,"I have a few things that might be helpful. 

Something I see lot of international students struggle with is that we love dogs here and allow animals into our homes. If you see a dog with a collar on, looks healthy, it is probably friendly. We don’t have a lot of street dogs where I live, a stray dog without a person is probably a lost and beloved pet. I don’t know if this culture shock applies to Romanians or not. 

I have heard from a student from Spain that he was shocked by how money obsessed we are here. We talk about the value of anything in terms of money. Its a habit. I hate it, I think we should care about the intrinsic value of things, but I have to talk about everything in terms of how valuable it is to the economy in order to convince others it is worth protecting. Wolves? They are beautiful and help maintain stream and elk/deer herd health. But I have to quantify that monetarily against the losses ranchers have when wolf presence reduces calf birth weight and slows how fast range cattle put on weight. We have nuclear waste sites, and I have to try to quantify the monetary cost of potential radiation poisoning and show that it will be more expensive than the cost of cleanup. But even when the healthcare cost is shown to be higher, cleanups Don’t happen because the cleanup is too expensive. Or the comparison will be hand waved away because we can handle the long term cost of healthcare because it is spread over time, but not the immediate costs of cleanup because it costs too much right now. It is infuriating, and it is part of U.S. culture. 

Speaking of money, our healthcare system is a non-navigable labyrinth. Your best bet is to get a job that offers health insurance, and always call ahead to see if where you want to go takes that insurance. No doctor visit is free, there are always copays. Never call an ambulance if you can get yourself to the hospital via car or cab. not only will it be faster, but you won’t have a $2,000 per city block bill at the end of it. The bottom line is that we don’t have universal healthcare. If you have money it can be very good, if you don’t you are fucked. I have worked for a student exchange program here, one of our official in case of emergencies guidelines is to tell any injured students that our healthcare is expensive, might not take their insurance and to ask them if they are sure about calling an ambulance before we call for help. I wish I was joking. 

Racism and discrimination are alive and well here. I don’t really have anything I can say that will explain all of it. Most people are friendly though, so give people the benefit of the doubt. 

Every single state has different laws. Some allow weed and you can buy it legally, in others you will be thrown in jail for having hemp. Some states highly regulate gun ownership, others allow open carry and concealed carry without a permit. Know the state laws wherever you go or travel. Same goes for customs. For example, in my home state, if you go five miles per hour over the speed limit, you will get a speeding ticket. In other states, you can go 10 over and will not get ticketed. That’s not on paper, it is just how the locals drive and how the police have decided to enforce the laws. 

Culture is different on all different scales here. I had culture shock when I moved a few hundred miles within my own state. I think the biggest cultural differences is between urban and rural areas. If you see a gun in a rural area, it’s probably a hunter or rancher, and curious but no reason for alarm. If you see a gun in a city, either its at a shooting range, on a police officer, or you are potentially in danger. In rural areas people don’t wear seat belts, sometimes drink and drive, and do all sorts of things that aren’t legal but are somewhat tolerated. The police are usually friendly. In urban areas, police make me feel uncomfortable just with their presence. Public transportation is normal in larger cities, but in most other areas you need a car. There’s a lot more to this, but yeah-research the culture and demographics of the place you are headed. Also note that an Indian reservation is like its own state with its own laws. They have their own law enforcement and sovereignty over that land, even if it is inside of a state. So pay attention to that too. It’s why gambling is illegal in some states but then you can go gambling on a reservation (in that same state) without breaking the law. 

We are known to be very friendly to visitors once you get in to our country. However, for some this can make it hard to know if someone is really becoming your friend or if they are just being polite. I can’t help here, I struggle with this as well. 

Hope this helps"

loseweight,fn3tcso,t3_fs509w,1586627521.0,"I dunno if this will help, but you could try it. Figure out a meal plan or two that has approximately the amount of calories you want to eat each day, and just stick to that meal plan. Don’t worry about actually counting things each day. For example, chicken breasts will vary a little in weight, but not enough to impact the calories much, unless you are running a very narrow deficit. Focus on counting the approximate calories once, when you plan a meal. Another thing you could try is an app. The Fitbit app, for example, has foods you can look up, and you can just approximate the calories that way, though I would err on the side of overestimating rather than underestimating."
loseweight,fn3sds2,t3_fuitnf,1586626986.0,"I sometimes feel better if I don’t eat for half a day, and I know that some people fast for days on end and are just fine. They are at a healthy weight, have plenty of muscle mass, etc. In my opinion, fasting can be part of a healthy lifestyle, but with some serious caveats. 

As a weight loss method, starving yourself for days at a time isn’t a great strategy. It’s better to be consistent day to day with healthy eating habits and exercise. Also, if someone has an eating disorder such as anorexia, it’s a thing to avoid. It’s better to be overweight than underweight. 

However, if you are someone who always feels hungry, it might be a good thing to try fasting for a day. There are different types of hunger. For me, there is craving food because it would taste good, and there is needing food because my body is low on energy. If you can tell the difference between these feelings, it can help with deciding not to snack when you just feel snacky."

Do you have any other hobby or activity you can try other than snacking? Here are a few things that help me, maybe they can help you too. 

Every time you find yourself going just to snack, don’t let yourself into the kitchen unless it is to get a glass of water or to eat a low energy snack like an apple or carrot stick. Don’t keep food in your room. Chew gum. Start an art project or something else fun and do that instead. Don’t use food as a reward, if you exercised or did something else worthy of reward, don’t use it as an excuse to eat extra food. I will sometimes eat a small piece of candy as a reward, but that’s as far as I let it go. And, this has gotten more true for me over time, but avoid refined sugar and don’t drink soda of any kind. Sparkling water is ok, but candy and other deserts should be avoided as much as possible. And keep up with the daily walks and weight lifting. Building muscle (at least to me) is less exciting than walking or running, but more muscle will help burn calories and increase bone density, which is why it is good to do your entire life. Note that this kind of training may make you lose weight slower, but that is because you are building muscle mass, not just working off extra fat. If you train, you can lose fat and get trim without losing much weight, so don’t obsess over that number. 

The most important thing is to try to retrain your brain. If you change your habits with the idea that it is temporary, you will hold out for a while and then relapse. Try to get it out of your head that you need to stop snacking, and then resist snacking. Tell yourself you don’t snack, and then don’t snack."
