depression,fpn252l,t3_gea6mo,1588747918.0,Very relatable. I've always been a people pleaser. Everytime I see someone or a movie portraying having the one great friendship bond with another person it makes me long for that too. I'm tired of being the only one putting in the work to try and connect with that person. Or feeling like you're trying to invite yourself. For once I'd like someone to think of me suddenly and invite me instead. I do have anxiety but I do my best to make everyone happy and like me. Other times I think what's the point when I'm 30 years old already and is wanting a best friend other than my husband is stupid and maybe it's too late.  It's crazy that also leads to me feeling like I'm still a child or in high school always on the outside looking in with no friends
modernwarfare,fpn0wz8,t3_ge4jey,1588746950.0,"I thought I'd go back to the game after a small break to play some newer releases and older ones during quantine jobless times and when I did I couldn't sprint at all. Took apart my controller for cleaning, didn't work. So I found auto run setting to test if it was actually the game glitching and my guy totally lags on drawing and tucking away the gun so badly. So yah definitely something so small is broken. It's a deal breaker for me cuz it just stops all momentum and flow for me to enjoy it at all."
