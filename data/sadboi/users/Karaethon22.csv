Apathy is common with depressive disorders, and in some cases the person doesn't notice any of the more ""typical"" symptoms of depression. Sometimes it's not that you're sad or unhappy as much as you're just blandly dissatisfied with everything or don't care at all.

You may also be experiencing executive dysfunction (a disconnect between what you want/intend to do and what you actually do) and/or dissociation (disconnecting from reality/spaciness). Both are symptoms, typically of anxiety disorders but not necessarily, and come in a bunch of different forms. So they look a little different for everyone but they're possibilities based on your post.

Service animals are not exempt from animal control ordinances, including leash laws, but there are case by case exceptions.

A service animal must be leashed or tethered unless the device interferes with the animal's tasks or the handler's disability prevents the use of such a device. Basically, unless the handler just cannot leash their dog because of their disability, the dog (or horse) must be leashed. If the handler can leash their animal, but it interferes with certain tasks, the animal can be unleashed to task and then leashed again after.

The animal must always remain under control via voice or signal, so all this is neither here nor there in this particular story. The dog was clearly not under control. Just fyi."
AmItheAsshole,fqmqbml,t3_gjmojy,1589481726.0,"NTA. One of my dogs is a foster fail. (A dog you're supposed to be just fostering but end up adopting)

Fosters are given dibs on adopting the dog. This is true at every rescue and shelter I've ever heard of. It's best for the dog to not change homes, so organizations give the foster family priority. Most are pretty transparent up front about it before they bring the dog home, and usually even have a little while for the dog to get settled in their foster placement before they advertise as adoptable. The foster family had their chance and should have emotionally prepared themselves (as much as that's possible).

And lest you get hung up on the part where I said they shouldn't change homes: that's not an absolute, just a general best case scenario. In your case it's already happened, so it's best for the dog to not go through it again. Moving is hard for dogs. They go through several adjustment periods. The first one is the most stressful and lasts about 3 days. So your dog has had her world upheaved and is just starting to relax. It's the worst possible time to move her again.

askwomenadvice,fpf3t0a,t3_gczckp,1588561115.0,"You should see a therapist. For real, it can really help, and nothing I say can compare to professional advice.

But in general you need to focus on self worth. Right now you're defining yourself through social status, money, attractiveness, etc. These are all ephemeral things that can change at any time and don't actually say anything about who you are. So when you attempt to define yourself by them, you're basically saying that you are good for nothing else, and when they're gone you feel like nothing.

I had similar issues. Still kind of do, but it's *massively* improved. For me the game changing first step was when my therapist asked me who my best friend was and to describe why I liked her. Take a second to think about your best friend.

I said I loved my friend's laugh and the ridiculous expressions she would make. I talked about stories we wrote together and her sense of humor. And my therapist pointed out that nowhere in anything I'd said had I chosen this friend for her salary or being employee of the month or any of the things I was so certain made me better. I didn't choose the people in my life for looks or numbers, and they didn't choose *me* for such things.

So maybe take a little while to list things you like about yourself and/or are good at. These things cannot be work/school related or inherent physical aspects. So for beauty, for example, you can put down that you're good at doing makeup or hair, but not your hair or eye color.

That alone makes programs better for some people.

Nevermind that owner training means the trainer is inherently disabled and may be limited by their disability. If you're training your dog to do something you can't do yourself, knowledge of how to teach it only takes you so far. Like if you use a wheelchair, retrieval could be difficult or impossible to train simply because you can't reach items for repetition.

Yeah, owner trained dogs can be awesome, but like? Pets are different. If you have experience with training pets that's a great start, but an impressively trained pet is basically what a service dog has to be like *off duty*.

But basically be willing to say and show that she's free. If she's overwhelmed by freedom (it can happen, look for signs like she never wants anything specific or is *always* prioritizing others) the best thing to do is offer suggestions to let her pick from. Try to make it clear your preferences are not a factor.

Obviously that can all be situational. There are times to ignore this method, either because of safety reasons or because your preferences are relevant. Stay as close as the situation allows to giving her free reign to decide. It really does go a long way.

Otherwise be there for her. Use the above advice when discussing trauma. She chooses what she wants to say and when, if she wants to talk. If you want to encourage her to talk to you, just don't be pushy (and trauma survivors often have a unique definition of pushy). Offer, make it clear it's a standing offer and up to her, drop it. If you add anything about yourself, it's likely to be read as manipulative. So examples. 

Good: ""I love you and am happy to listen if and when you need someone to talk to. No judgment."" Bad: ""please talk to me, I think it could help you to discuss it. I'm here for you.""

The TL;DR is that you don't need to register your dog or pass a test. You need to be able to honestly answer a couple specific questions about training, but that's all most entities can require as proof. In housing you'll need proof of disability, but there's no one specific thing you need. A doctor's letter is usually enough, but there are other kinds that can be used instead.  


I do recommend you read all of the information on the federal links though, as there are a lot of nuances to it. And while a test isn't required, it's generally a good idea to take one if you can find one. Even if it's just administered ""unofficially"" by whoever is training your dog, because it's a good way to measure what needs work before the dog is ready. I like [this](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/law-crime-and-justice/human-rights/guide-animals/bc-guide-dog-service-dog-assessment.pdf) one, which is legally recognized elsewhere in the world.

When we touched down, the rear landing gear *bounced* off the runway, and then the nose slammed down hard enough to snap my jaw shut painfully. My husband was asking if it was normal so I just played it cool. We waited around for our layover and caught our connecting flight, which landed during a storm. Totally freaked the husband out thinking it would be worse, but that one was perfectly smooth. So he knew I'd been lying.

^1 since you said you aren't familiar with aviation, a brief explanation of a stall: the wind moving over the wings is what allows the aircraft to fly. No airflow, no lift. Imagine the airplane pointing straight up; the wind would hit the flat bottom of the wings as the craft moves forward. No airflow from the front, and the plane drops out of the sky. Point down to correct it. So if you tilt your nose up too far, you can choke your lift and fall. Unintentionally stalling during take off or landing is rare, but dangerous because you don't have space to dive and recover from it."

I'm going with ""probably stressed."" This is the kind of thing you could desensitize to and have the dog see it as no big deal, and there isn't info to say whether or not that was done with this dog. It takes time and patience though, and the average dog owner wouldn't know how to do it. But when it lifts off the ground, look at the paws. They stay flat like it's still standing, meaning tense ankles. It's probably a freeze response called learned helplessness (look it up, humans demonstrate it too sometimes, so it's good to know about). Anyway, a relaxed dog would let their legs hang limp because they weren't worried about falling. Also stillness is often a good indicator of stress in dogs. Obviously not always, but a lot more than most people realize.

From the Job Accommodation Network:  
 

>Do employers have to allow employees to train service animals in the workplace?  
>  
>Under the ADA, only employees with disabilities are entitled to  reasonable accommodations so if an employee without a disability is  training a service animal for someone else, there is no accommodation  obligation under the ADA. For employees with disabilities, an employer  has a valid concern about the potential disruption a service animal in  training might create so might not have to allow the employee to bring  in the service animal until it is fully trained or at least until it can  be in the workplace without disruption. Some states have laws  addressing access for service animals in training, so employers also  should check their state laws.  
>  
>**What this means for employers:**  When an employee asks to bring in a service animal in training, you  should check state laws first. If state law does not address access for  service animals in training, then you should next determine whether the  employee who is making the request has a disability and needs the  service animal because of the disability. If the employee does have a  disability, then you need to get more information to determine whether  the service animal in training will be disruptive (e.g., you could have  the employee demonstrate the animal’s behavior and current level of  training).  
>  
>**What this means for employees:**  Because federal law does not address whether an employer must consider  allowing an employee with a disability to bring in a service animal in  training, it is unclear whether your employer has to consider allowing  you to bring in a service animal that is not fully trained. If you  decide to ask anyway, you should be prepared to show that your service  animal is at least trained enough not to disrupt the workplace and that  you will not be distracted from your work while continuing to train the  service animal.

askwomenadvice,fm1mvp8,t1_fm1dntl,1585681300.0,"Holy trauma responses Batman. TL;DR you need to see a trauma therapist. I know you're already seeing a therapist, but if they don't consider trauma a specialization, they are unlikely to be able to help you, and could potentially make it worse. Trauma responses require specific treatment, and trying other kinds of treatment on them can make them stronger.  


So you need professional help. What I'm going to say is no substitute for that. Nor are any articles, this is going to take a professional working with you to pick apart your thoughts, behaviors, and relationships.  


But for starters, you're exhibiting a ton of fawn responses. Everyone knows fight or flight, but there are actually four. Fight, flight, freeze, and fawn, and everyone has one or two they favor, although you might see the other two situationally. Conflict avoidance is often a fawn response, and your primary one. I mean, even the way you're writing here, to avoid conflict on this thread, is a fawn response. I really think it's controlling an unhealthy percentage of your life. Your couple of times lashing out could maybe be fight responses (it's possible that's your secondary), but I don't think you have an anger problem. I think you have an anxiety problem that sometimes manifests in anger (very common due to people who default to fight).  


One major fawn response that could prove problematic here is the desperation to please your wife. Fawn response can make people think they are happier than they actually are (Stockholm Syndrome being an extreme example), and you may find you're happier without her. Or maybe not, but I think it's super important you find out. And you can only learn by doing. Please discuss a potential separation with a therapist to help you figure out the best way to approach this. Please don't dismiss it outright. I'm not saying to divorce her or anything extreme like that. I'm saying take some time to get to know yourself, because I'm pretty certain you don't know who you are without her. You need to know in order to address your relationships to the best of your ability. I do not think your relationship is healthy, but right now you need to focus on your half of it, which is to say yourself.

Dissociation is a defense mechanism built into the human brain that allows you to process information and handle stress. Healthy dissociation is commonly things like daydreaming and ""auto pilot.""

Unhealthy dissociation tends to occur with mental illnesses of any variety, but is especially prominent in anxiety disorders. Unhealthy versions can manifest in a lot of ways, but some common ones are feeling like you aren't real, the world isn't real, you're watching yourself in a movie, memory loss, time slips, or even out of body experiences.

Dissociation can be helped with grounding. Reorienting your mind to reality. In your case it seems to be about a stagnant routine, so I'd say probably types of grounding that are activities.

mentalhealth,fltsm9t,t3_fr3hp9,1585485899.0,"That's a very normal reaction to trauma. As someone who has PTSD and has been through years of trauma therapy, trauma is the effect a situation has on you. Not the situation itself. It takes an ""extreme"" situation to create a trauma response, but the definition of extreme is pretty subjective and varies a lot from person to person. It's also perfectly normal to compare your trauma to others and see yourself as inadequate. It's a defense mechanism; your brain is trying to convince itself you're safe and this is no big deal so that it can protect itself in the future. The downside of that is that it makes you think your suffering doesn't count. It does though! You can put two traumatized people together and they'll probably both do it. Let's say one was in a terrible car accident and the other was a child abuse victim. The accident victim might say, ""at least mine was over quickly, I can't imagine having it happen over and over"" while the abuse victim may think, ""at least I knew what to expect, imagine having it happen out of nowhere."" The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence. Or in this case the trauma is always worse. In truth there's no such thing as worse. It doesn't *matter* what anyone else went through. Everyone deserves appropriate care. Does the fact that I was abused somehow make your traumatic experience not have happened? Or in some way preclude you getting treatment? No, it's irrelevant to your situation. You have the same needs regardless of what I or anyone else is going through.  


Just so you know you're not alone though, I struggled with this a *lot*. Part of my trauma involved my mom dismissing the abuse as no big deal. And the first psychiatrist I asked about PTSD told me it didn't count because my abuser was disabled and therefore I should have protected myself better. Which sounds *insane* to me now, dude should not be practicing psychiatry, and every doctor/therapist since then I've told about that has been appalled. But at the time I accepted it at face value because it fit the narrative I'd already been stuck in. Learning to accept that my trauma is trauma has taken years, and I'd be lying if I said I didn't still have my doubts. But it does get better, it just takes time and effort."

AskReddit,flsr12u,t1_flspke4,1585448649.0,"You got bit, almost certainly. They affect people differently and so far scientists haven't been able to figure out why. It doesn't even seem to be consistent within families. But one person could have no reaction or itchiness, and the next could develop large, painful welts. And that's not even factoring in allergies, which are a thing but are technically rare. Mostly it's just considered a complex skin reaction.

We got bed bugs thanks to my brother, who has no reaction to them at all and does absolutely nothing to control the infestation because he doesn't care and is a terrible person. When we had them, I'd have painful, itchy hives all over my body that would drive me damn near insane. My husband mostly felt nothing, but occasionally had a little bite or two that were like mild mosquito bites for a day or so."
AskReddit,flspzyw,t1_flsncm3,1585447929.0,"So not so fun fact, bed bugs have evolved alongside humans and feed on us almost exclusively. They'll bite your pets if it comes to it, but they can't walk on hair as well as other bugs can, so it's not their jam. At risk of sounding like the koala copypasta:  


Humans are exceptionally good at creating shelter and keeping the area clear of threats. Once upon a time it was caves, these days it's houses. In any case it's a bloodsucking little shit's paradise. No predators, no environmental danger, constant food supply. They literally have no natural threats except for us, because we'll kill them stone dead if we find them. So they've evolved very specifically to evade humans. Their feet are designed to walk on our skin without being felt if at all possible (which is why they can't walk across fur very well), they have a toxin in their saliva that numbs us so we don't feel them biting, and they are extremely resilient and good at hiding in small spaces. More recently, they've developed resistances to almost every manufactured pesticide there is. Whatever you're using to kill other bugs will do nothing to bed bugs. You can squash them if you find them, but they're usually too well hidden. And if you do, they have a flat body that is resistant to being crushed. You kind of have to crush and grind to kill them that way. They can't really be drowned effectively, and if you try to starve them you'll lose: an adult bed bug can survive for a **year** without feeding, and the young ones only feed once a week. They need nothing but blood to survive. Nothing. Once you get them they pretty much have to be cooked out of your house with a heat treatment due to their chemical resistances and the way they hide in small cracks. Literally, they're probably in your walls and ceiling as much or more than your bed. Furniture, electronics, anywhere they can hide. Also the heat treatment has to be done evenly, at inhospitable temperatures, for several hours. It's not a DIY kind of process and trying to do that is a great way to burn your house down.  


But at least the bugs would be gone, I guess."
AskReddit,flsovgw,t1_flsnbdj,1585447153.0,I literally have to use techniques I've learned in trauma therapy to calm back down again once I have that tickle happen. And I'm just not going to fall back asleep for several hours at least.
