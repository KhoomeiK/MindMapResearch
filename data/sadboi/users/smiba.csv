Your film may have minor light leaks around the edges of the frame but most of it is likely saved, but this is depending on how light it was outside and how long you've stored it in the light like this

When loading film in your GA645 (same for most MF cameras), make sure the little film piece you insert into the takeup spool is flat. This makes sure the film gets spooled up flat and correct"
