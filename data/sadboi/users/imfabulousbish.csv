I have a very weird view on relationships anyways, so there’s that. We’re currently in an open relationship, so he isn’t the only „best friend I have sex with“. 
Idk how exactly to explain this, but I‘m very close with one of my fwb‘s and I would consider her my best friend. But I don’t have that same feeling of „in-love-ness“ or whatever with her that I have with my bf. Romantic attraction to me feels different than sexual attraction and platonic love. 
Idk I think a relationship can mean different things to different people? I would call mine a relationship bc that romantic aspect is there too, because he’s the one I wanna live with long term, adopt some pets with and all that and I can’t imagine anyone else in his position. (Not in the „if things were to not work out between us I could never love again“ way, more as in I‘m perfectly happy with having him.)
I don’t know if any of this makes any sense, I basically just wanted to say that a relationship to me is a bit more than best friends having sex, but that’s just me and I’m the last to judge how other people see relationships. And I can totally see the point you’re making too.

BPDSOFFA,fo2dd6i,t3_g583br,1587458111.0,"Hi, pwBPD here.
I don’t know if I can say anything helpful, but I‘ll try.

If you want to get over his ex, not stalking her would probably be a start. I get why you do it, but getting over her requires not having that much information about her at all times. 
Also him being on NC with her is a good start. Really make it clear that it’s not okay for him to bring her up and all that. Sounds like he definitely needs to get over her completely too, and he needs to be completely sure about wanting to be with you for this to work.

And I obviously can’t see into his mind, but as a pwBPD I usually hurt people in that way when I get scared of them leaving, so I try to push them away and pretend I don’t have feelings for them first. Sometimes that even gets to the point of thinking I actually never felt anything for them. 
Him actually trying to make it work, doing therapy and couples therapy and going nc with his ex shows that he’s trying, so I‘d guess his „I love you“s are genuine. It’s okay if you need some time to trust him on that again. Time and him not messing it up again is probably what’s needed to rebuild that trust.

And lastly, we are definitely capable of love. It just takes a lot of work on our side to make it work. That being said, if you feel he isn’t ready to put that work in, doesn’t have enough self control, or you just can’t handle him, don’t blame yourself if you decide to end the relationship for good. At the end of the day, you have to do what‘s right for you."
