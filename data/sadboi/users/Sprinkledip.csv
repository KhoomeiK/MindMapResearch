Anxiety,fpmzinx,t3_gdvmje,1588745847.0,"Me right now. I‚Äôm so exhausted...every day and every night but it‚Äôs always the same. Start to fall asleep but suddenly wake up with panic and weird pains/breathing. Horrible. I usually have to drink water, sit up, and watch some silly videos online. Other times I have to just be awake until light and until my body forces itself asleep because of the intense exhaustion."
Anxiety,fpmz989,t3_ge5daj,1588745649.0,"Oh hun I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre feeling this way. It truly is terrifying...you feel like you should be able to control out but it‚Äôs really out of your control. Have you been able to see a doctor and get some medication? I finally bit the bullet and went today (had a complete meltdown in the office) and the doctor was very kind and started me on medication. Even that little bit of ‚Äúvalidation‚Äù helped some. 

You are not alone. This time in life is amplifying everything. You are stronger than you think. Sending love <3"
Anxiety,fpmxoxh,t3_ged0ul,1588744443.0,"Once it starts it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to stop it. It runs over you like a train. Most of the time when I start to have an attack I‚Äôm relaxed in my chair, watching Netflix with no thoughts...suddenly my heart starts pounding and my throats closes, I start shaking and crying and I feel like I‚Äôm going to suffocate and die. It sounds very dramatic but that‚Äôs exactly how it goes for me each time. Anxiety and attacks come and go for me. I‚Äôll go through months where it‚Äôs super bad...but then I can go a full year without having problems. I‚Äôve always had anxiety issues since I was a child (now 24) even though I‚Äôve lived a fairly normal life without any big trauma in my life. So in my situation I think it can be hereditary. Also, my anxiety is more physical. I get anxious thoughts but my biggest trigger is random physical symptoms. 

It‚Äôs okay that you don‚Äôt understand and are asking questions but please try to use better language. People with anxiety are already very aware of their lack of control with their symptoms sometimes and we wish it was as easy to ‚Äújust breathe‚Äù. I have sat for an entire hour doing breathing exercises and telling myself I‚Äôm okay while my heart is pounding out of my chest but it doesn‚Äôt work and the attack comes regardless. It‚Äôs a horrible disorder and I don‚Äôt wish it upon anyone."

Anxiety,fpmw7jk,t3_ge9ghw,1588743386.0,"Literally me right now. I‚Äôve tried using Benadryl but that doesn‚Äôt help either. I have to watch yputube, Netflix, etc until almost 6am some days before I pass out from pure exhaustion. It‚Äôs every night. I feel your pain."
