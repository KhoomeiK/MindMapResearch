danganronpa,fcsboz5,t3_eiju7a,1577914298.0,this whole edit series is incredible!!!! fantastic job!!!
BPD,fbbgzc9,t3_ecezdi,1576700263.0,I hate when I do this. Does anyone have advice how to break the spiraling loop?
BPD,f87mqb8,t3_dumepe,1574337401.0,This is the worst byproduct of my illness. I want to know that people like my art. I want to be seen and to have others purchase my work and get excited like they do about other artists‚Äô accounts. It eats at me. I complain about it on social media too which I suspect is driving people away. I can never get it right.
BPD,f84ilqj,t1_f84i1yc,1574250285.0,In my head I just want the perfect friend that always responds to my texts and texts me first if I‚Äôm not feeling good but in reality I need to remember that‚Äôs not possible and I can‚Äôt rely on others so much. I want to go into isolation but I feel like my brain won‚Äôt allow it because I‚Äôll just lose more friends.
BPD,f83mgx8,t1_f837ku0,1574215324.0,"how were you able to get to that point? i'm tired of double, triple-texting only to be left on read. how do you stay distracted from checking to see if they've responded every like 3 minutes?"
BPD,f83mdkl,t3_dyse81,1574215265.0,I absolutely resonate with this. It boggles my mind a bit.
BPD,f6xyv3o,t3_dtm9ep,1573262580.0,"this is a really good way to look at it, i'll do my best to obtain this perspective!!!!! thank you for sharing this."
BPD,f6o2awt,t3_ds3et2,1573005971.0,"I resonate with this. I didn‚Äôt realize this was what he was doing until it was too late. We were together for four years, he left me seven months ago. I still feel like I‚Äôm not whole."
BPD,f5pjyuv,t3_docr01,1572361186.0,DAE have a hard time figuring out fantasy from reality? I did my first DND game yesterday and it felt like when my character was getting overshadowed and talked over that I was being attacked too. What do I do? I know my character is not me but I can‚Äôt figure out if someone is being mean or if it‚Äôs just their character being mean......

BPD,f4jd02w,t3_dkl7ba,1571617298.0,"I feel this to my core. I wish I could be more flexible but I get so anxious and upset if even the number of people, who the people are, or location changes."
BPD,f4jbw8o,t3_dklbcw,1571616687.0,"Lost my boyfriend of 4 years and all my college friends to it. Working on building a new life, trying to salvage what I can, but I can‚Äôt help but still feel hurt for them leaving AND me managing to shove them all away."
