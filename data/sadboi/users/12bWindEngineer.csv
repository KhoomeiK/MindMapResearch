Twins,fnyo719,t3_g4hhql,1587369500.0,"I never much cared, sometimes found it amusing or that people are just curious, very occasionally I’d get irritated if they were just plain dumb or distracting me when I’m busy or focused on something else and people weren’t getting the hint. Now that I’m twinless, I’d give anything to be asked these dumb questions."
IWantOut,fnrqvj4,t3_g34qj8,1587198164.0,"Apply at GE, they’re often willing to sponsor visas for engineering jobs, and they have international offices. You may even be able to get a job with them in the UK and then transfer."
Adopted,fno3101,t3_fy1u0f,1587110218.0,"I was adopted at birth along with my identical twin. We always knew, parents never kept it from us. At 18 we were given the option to unseal our records and my parents would help us find our biological parents (I didn’t know it yet, but she already knew where our biological mother was). My brother and I declined. We had a good family, we didn’t need more than that. Fast forward almost 10 years and my brother gets cancer. He did two years of treatments but ultimately lost that fight and my mom invited our biological mother to the funeral. I didn’t know she’d be there, I was introduced to her afterward. I didn’t take it well, I’d just lost my twin, I didn’t want a different family member to replace him with. I did have tea with my biological mother the next day before her flight left, but that was the one and only time we spoke. She sends me cards on our birthday and Christmas now but I haven’t opened one yet. I’m not in a place yet where I want contact and I’m not sure I ever will be. Everyone has to make their own decisions about it and as an adoptive parent you need to accept and support whatever your adopted child’s wishes are unconditionally."
Twins,fno283z,t3_g1kgne,1587109396.0,"I am so very sorry for your loss. I lost my identical twin to cancer when we were 29. I hate to say it, but there’s little you can do. It really is a grief and a loss like no other. Words cannot even describe it. Let him be sad, and have his feelings, and talk when he wants to, and not talk when he doesn’t want do. Just be there. Accept the fact that he may never be the same again, and don’t point it out or push him to go back to normal. Things will never go back to normal. Get him grief therapy and antidepressants if necessary. I wish I had better advice but there is a rough road ahead of him, hold his hand through it."

Twins,flwknrt,t3_fgmyb9,1585554247.0,"Identical twin here. I’m 31. I have severe, severe depression. My twin suffered a bit from depression as well, mostly after he got sick, I assume it’s partially genetic. He never saw anyone for it, we used to just turn to each other to get through it. Since he died though, it’s been rough. I was institutionalized on a psychiatric hold for a short time and now I see a professional, but I don’t find them to be anywhere near as helpful as talking with my twin was."
TwinlessTwins,fc4jp85,t1_fbyxlqx,1577418643.0,It really does feel like half of your soul has been torn out and amputated. There no cure for that
TwinlessTwins,fc4jk6c,t1_fbzpt4h,1577418526.0,"I am fortunate that my family may not understand but they aren’t malicious about it and try to be supportive, they just don’t know how to help and honestly, neither do I."
TwinlessTwins,fbynw9a,t3_eez44f,1577221722.0,"I lost my identical twin last year, 20 months ago. Cancer. We were 29. He was my best friend, my closest confidant, my partner in crime. He would have stood with me against anything. I feel like the grief just gets worse as time goes on, not better. Watching my family heal and get over their grief has made it even worse I think. They don’t really understand what it’s like and i think they’re losing patience that I just get worse. I’m not sure I’ll ever reach a point where I’m okay. I think about him daily, every night when I go to bed, or first thing in the morning, it just hits me like a ton of bricks. I wish I had some advice for you, but you’re not alone. I’m in the same place. If you ever need to chat, message me. Sometimes I feel like only other twinless twins really, truly understand."
Adopted,fadfs1w,t3_e7aj5r,1575969178.0,"I have two non biological sisters. I’m decently close with both. Closer to one than the other. But I’m no where near as close with them as I was with my identical twin brother. No idea if that was a twin thing or that we were each other’s only biological relative. Not that I dislike either of my sisters, but they’re from being on the same level to me as my twin was."
Adopted,fadfh3z,t3_e8je2b,1575968717.0,Did your sample get mixed up with someone else’s at the DNA lab? I’d test your mother and repeat your own test.
Twins,f997ada,t3_e14r7b,1575187893.0,I really like these. I lost my identical twin last year to cancer. I’m so sorry you had to go through that.
Twins,f996egc,t3_e23hd5,1575187704.0,"My identical twin and I were a half inch difference between us. He was about 6’3.5”, I’m barely under 6’3.” Ultimately insignificant, you wouldn’t notice looking at us"
Twins,ex7l0ab,t3_cq1db3,1566061634.0,"I loved it, personally. My identical twin brother and I usually agreed on almost everything except what color we wanted things and my parents were good about helping us compromise and making sure we both got a say and got unique touches that were individual. Neither of us liked being the center of attention so having someone to share the spotlight with was the perfect situation for us. As an adult it was always an excuse to be together, we’d almost always spend it together if we could- backpacking, going somewhere fun, engaging in shenanigans. Now that he’s gone I can’t bring myself to even acknowledge our birthday, and surprisingly my family respects that and doesn’t make a fuss. I’d give anything to have to share my birthday again"
Twins,ex5mjql,t3_cr0gzd,1566027127.0,"People used to ask my (identical) twin and me if we were twins and we’d usually say (often in unison cause it happened so often) “No, he’s adopted.” Which was still true, we’re both adopted. But it would throw people off."
depression,ewqq3uq,t3_cpidz8,1565674303.0,"Yep, 100% ‘Home’ was anywhere my twin brother was. I can’t go home now because he’s gone. Home no longer exists."

IWantOut,ethon25,t3_cbid6m,1562822058.0,"I am right there with you. My parents are british but I grew up in the US, but spent a lot of time in Europe growing up. I feel like my experiences of traveling and experiencing other cultures and other lifestyles is so different as to be incomprehensible to many of my peers. With a dual citizenship and an engineering degree (I’m also a bachelor with no children- my life is very portable) I’ve debating heavily moving away but my family is here and that makes it a tough decision."
Twins,etho75a,t3_cbl8w8,1562821619.0,"Lost my identical twin last year to cancer. It was easily the single worst event in my entire life by ten orders of magnitude. I miss him every day. I’ve had crippling depression since, was forced into grief counseling that does nothing, still deal with random bouts of uncontrollable crying- always at the worst possible moments. Work meetings, in the grocery store- every time the smallest thing reminds me of him. It feels like a giant black hole left in my life, and all I can often think about is that I cannot go 40 or more years alone without him."
HumansBeingBros,et09362,t3_c9fqdv,1562374843.0,I own my late brother’s dog and the beeping noise is the scariest thing in the world to her. If it was going on for days I might break into the neighbors house just to change the battery myself.

Showerthoughts,er7q5qo,t3_c0tucx,1560584243.0,"I have met this person. Except he wasn’t adopted, his family just lived in China and he grew up there. His family was from Texas so he spoke English with a Chinese accent and a Texas twang to it. It was the wildest accent I’ve ever heard. He lived in Austin and worked for a hibachi grill when I met him."

TwinlessTwins,eq5skdb,t3_bxct5b,1559812932.0,"I lost my identical twin 3 months before our 30th birthday last year. Cancer. I just can’t bring myself to acknowledge our birthday anymore. My family tries to and I beg them not to. They wanted to make a big deal because it was our 30th, I wasn’t interested in celebrating a milestone without him. It’s just an awful reminder that I have dozens more to go without him, which is not something I ever imagined happening. It’s easier if I can pretend it’s not happening, that it’s not our birthday, and try not to think about it. My family doesn’t understand. It’s been 13 months and every single day is a struggle. I’m not cut out to be a twinless twin. Our birthday is coming up again next month, Trying to figure out how I can skip it and hide from my family. I guess for us twins, it’s just a wound that will never heal."
AskReddit,eof0vi9,t3_bri3ja,1558516370.0,"When my twin brother was waking up from a major surgery once he kept pulling the nurses aside, pointing at me, and asking them if they thought I was attractive (or telling them that I was) and reminding them that we were identical twins. I tried so hard to shut him up but damn he was persistent when he was high."
