I am at a low point in my life right now and desperately trying to find something to start helping myself get out a black hole of depression and hopelessness. I've struggled with anxiety and depression my whole life and only ever treated the symptoms. My hope is that Aya may help me start to go deeper and help me unpack my ways of thinking, roots of my behaviors. I'm scared, however, that I will dig down deeper inside myself and find something I like even less -- find myself even more worthless/irredeemable than I already feel.

I am curious if any one has any experience with vipassana? In August I attended a 10 day vipassana retreat with the same motivation -- going deeper into myself. I had some success but not quite the insight I had hoped to find. I have so much defense and self-grasping built up that my hopes would be Aya would help me release some of that in order to step away from myself more and thus more objectively examine the sources of my issues."

StopSelfHarm,fqo5ggj,t3_gjqh2d,1589507954.0,"OMG. I can relate to this SO HARD. The past few months I have really been struggling with suicidal ideation, and this is exactly what I've been doing in so many ways. I have always struggled with my weight and lately if I start trying to get it back in check, exercising/eating right, I find myself stopping and going crazy eating junk food almost because I specifically want to push myself over the edge and I'm more likely to do it if I feel myself fat beyond redemption (on top of everything else). I also keep putting myself in untenable situations -- like purposefully not doing work at work even if I have time to do it just so I lose my job so it will make suicide seem even more like the only option.

I know how crazy it is as I do it and even as I type this -- I know that's exactly the way NOT to feel better and get out of this depression but I guess I'm at that point where I've just given up hope so much that I want to get it over with and do whatever I have to give myself the final straw to finally push myself over the edge.

I'm trying to just keep chugging along the best I can to get out of it but the more I do stuff like this the more I wonder how I possibly ever will."

news,fow57yz,t1_fovob8s,1588113236.0,Just because they are stronger dogs does not mean they are more violent. MANY other dogs have a much higher bite risk.

dementia,fovhmo9,t1_foujkb2,1588101465.0,"Wow -- your post really struck me -- you described my grandma EXACTLY. We were extremely lucky to be able to bring her to our home before the lockdown but when she was in a LTC facility even without a lockdown, those were the exactly the concerns I had as well.  We had issues as well with medication being prescribed ""as needed"" and she not being able to communicate that to the staff. 

It's wonderful you are able to spend some time with her, but I totally understand why you would still have concerns.  I wish I had some great advice to  share but the points you made continued to be a struggle for us the whole time she was in LTC. 

My only thoughts would be to find out how the staff/team shares information on needs/patients -- a daily huddle? notes? white board? and make sure to have what you mentioned noted/addressed everywhere you can. We also had some luck by trying to form relationships with the staff members (I'm sure this is especially difficult right now with high turnover and everyone so overwhelmed). We would often find one staff member as an ""advocate/expert"" and they would help share our concerns/the best way to assist my grandmother with the rest of the staff. We also tried hanging signs in her room as reminders, to varying levels of success."
dementia,fov89nb,t3_g9lke8,1588096999.0,"I just want to mention that it is AWESOME and AMAZING that you are asking this question. Thank you for this and everything you do. 

I don't know how helpful this will be but several years ago I purchased a device called Nucleus that has worked really fabulous for our family members to contact my grandma with dementia -- it is a little video call device with a webcam on it and the best thing was you could set it so you could call and the person wouldn't have to ""pick up"" -- you just appear on the screen and could talk to them. There was no fee or anything and all my family members were able to make accounts so they could call my grandma's nucleus from their cell phone. It eliminated the technology barrier because my grandma did not need to press/dial/do anything with the device -- family members could just appear and start talking to her from the device (it was easy to set up with just wifi and a powercord) 

We are still using our Nucleus to keep connected during COVID but I went to their website as I was writing this out and was so so sad to find that unfortunately it seems they no longer produce them for home use. They do offer a commercial version but I don't know anything about the commercial version. It seems a little shady -- much higher than the price I paid for mine and has some sort of ""monthly service fee"" associated with use.

I'm not familiar with other technology since the Nucleus works for us  perfectly but maybe something like Echo Show or Google Home devices may have similar features? For my family, the Nucleus is wonderful because they can check in on my grandmother whenever they'd like without needing to get a third party to schedule/find time.  I know these devices are out of many families price ranges but perhaps tech companies would be willing to donate these products to LTC facilities. I wonder if they are doing that already? and if not -- why the heck not?!

I apologize -- I was just thinking out loud with all of that. You are amazing for doing what you are doing!!!  A lot of great suggestions already on here -- I agree completely with everyones comments and suggestions! great ideas!! 

Again -- I can't thank you enough for what you are doing.  You are amazing."

At one point he found me on the ground with my shirt of screaming how we going to miss the dogs theater production? Another time I was just sitting in the corner with arms on the wall and eyes wide open, catatonic. I didn't remember any of this. It got to where we agreed I had to be in bed about to go to sleep and tell him as I was taking it because these issues. When the script ran out, I didn't get it refilled. 

Powerful, powerful drug. Like affected me WAY more than anything I've taken in my life and again, this was at a prescribed 10 mgs. It is a crazy drug. I was honestly stunned how much it affected me -- my doctor had tried a bunch of other stuff for the insomnia that never worked so I thought I had a super high tolerance for everything.

I don't know your situation but I do know the feeling of really having no memory or understanding after taking Ambien. I agree with another commenter: all that can be done now is sober up and therapy all around."
