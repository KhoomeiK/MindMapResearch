ask_transgender,fnpep7k,t1_fnow2td,1587144198.0,i‚Äôm wondering what they mean by ‚Äúsomething that‚Äôs meant to be liberating could easily become another way to control me‚Äù because transitioning is not necessarily the answer for all trans people but for a LOT it‚Äôs liberating.
traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns,fnovdh5,t1_fnnrl77,1587134317.0,to me it seems like they‚Äôre encouraging people to not transition and to start to instead feel comfortable with their body.
ask_transgender,fnov278,t1_fnommel,1587134147.0,"i was feeling like this was a post that had more to do so  with body dysmorphia than gender dysphoria which are two separate things that they do seem to be saying are the same thing. i get they can sometimes effect the same group of people. but i don‚Äôt have have body dysmorphia i have gender dysphoria so this post really was confusing me. going on T can fix gender dysphoria where as going on T doesn‚Äôt fix body dysmorphic disorder. it seems to me that they‚Äôre encouraging people not to transition to be their true selves and that it‚Äôs all about accepting your body for how it is. also, the posts only focus is about their stomachs. i‚Äôm wondering if they think that going on t will somehow make them love their stomach? which i feel like stomachs aren‚Äôt really gendered in the first place and if anything with the fat redistribution it could add more weight onto the stomach instead of hips for instance."
