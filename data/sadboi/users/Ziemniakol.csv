depression,fiafkdp,t3_f791jw,1582300004.0,"I'm depressed for over 2 years now, (I am visiting psychiatrist and taking meds, so I suppose it actually is a ""real"" depression) but still every time I somehow menage to do something right, I feel like ""maybe I am overreacting? Do I even have a depression? Do I need those meds?"". And everything starts to look better, and then I am struck by life 2x harder than it should be, and I have no idea what I am doing wrong. Sometimes I feel like it's all pointless, but I know I need to fight. We all need."

I'll be seeing a psychiatrist next week to ask for some sleeping medicine, and I reccomend you to do the same.
