RationalPsychonaut,fbfvsrh,t3_ed3mq3,1576822806.0,"That must be so hard. Chronic, inescapable pain is enough to tear anyone down. You're brave to ask for help with your suicidal thoughts. When I was contemplating suicide from my pain, I didn't want to tell anyone. You're already ahead on this front. Keep on sharing your pain, both physical and psychological. Get a therapist and psychiatrist that you have a good feeling about (If you don't have one already). They can likely link you up with a social worker who can help you with everyday stressors and seeking a second opinion for your care. After that, try to find the highest regarded institution you can (like others say, Mayo Clinic is one, John Hopkins is another) and ask to be assessed by an expert who specializes in treating people with your condition. Since you had brain surgery, it's likely you'll need to seek out a highly decorated brain surgeon who can look at your symptoms, the failed surgery, and your medical history, to create a new treatment plan. 

There's still so much you can do. Please don't give up. Fight on and don't be afraid to ask for support when you feel overwhelmed."

researchchemicals,eubezul,t3_cfk8y9,1563646525.0,"I had a traumatic brain injury and was dealing with memory and processing issues. Some of that led me to become extremely depressed. I took the standard route and was on various anti-depressants for years. My life was starting to spiral out of control and I used substances (alcohol, weed, stims, etc) to cope. 

Well, somehow I heard and researched the effects of psychedelics on the brain. The first research I heard of was with LSD. While I never experimented with it after my injuries, the idea fascinated me. Then the NIH research into Ketamine came into my life. The fact that the FDA listed it as a breakthrough treatment for depression, coupled with Ketamine's increase of brain neuroplasticity, made me think this was the perfect fit for me. 

I ordered 2f-dck and began dosing myself. What I found was amazing. It worked like a miracle for me. I rediscovered my faith in God, my depression went out the window, and my processing power is back to pre-TBI levels. I do want to add a word of caution, though. Being depressed for so long and having such a powerful experience put me in a manic state for a day. Additionally, I removed some blocks in my brain that need to be adjusted or replaced. As of now I'm having trouble controlling my empathy for people, thus making my emotions a rollercoaster. Remember that these are psychedelics and you really should have a trip sitter.

Thank you for your interest in this topic, and letting me tell my story. It has been as much help to me, as it is to you."

researchchemicals,eti2npd,t1_etdcgnq,1562836485.0,"I think you'll want to look at the research involving Ketamine. It is looking like Ketamine is going to be the next level of treatment for some mental disorders. The national institute of health has some fascinating information posted about how Ketamine affects the brain. 

Since Ketamine is a controlled substance, RC's are the only way some of us can access the healing properties of this drug without being part of the clinical trials."

RealEstate,eq7txcj,t3_bxhbdo,1559853168.0,"Like everyone else is saying, get another CMA done by a different agent. 

It could be that she is actually looking out for you because if the house is really worth 400,000 her offer will save you from paying realtor fees. 

Another possibility is that you could get in a bidding war and make more than the asking price, however, if you sit on the market awhile, you are going to lose a lot of bargaining power. 

So really, you need to go to a third party to get your value."
