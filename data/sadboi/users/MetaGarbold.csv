depressed,fdidkok,t3_elisfu,1578440481.0,"I did an inpatient program, and a partial program.

The impatient program is very overwhelming/underwhelming. There are restrictions on what you can wear and bring. No shoelaces, belts, cellphones, ect. Hospitals are cramped and lack all forms of privacy: no doors on the bathrooms, check-in every 15 minutes.

The partial program was better. I got to stay at home and just attend program during day. Then I stepped down to group daily for a few weeks and then groups twice a week. It's both dehumanizing and enlightening...

If you go in for an evaluation they should help steer you towards the appropriate program for your intensity level. 

Real Advice: Go sooner rather than later. Start getting help now before you wake up in the inpatient hospital. Even if you just start by getting yourself a therapist and psychologist do it today. Groups can be helpful therapy is worth it.

If cost is a concern, find an AA meeting... Even if you aren't alcoholic and just share your story and listen to others share theirs. It's cheap / free group counseling."
