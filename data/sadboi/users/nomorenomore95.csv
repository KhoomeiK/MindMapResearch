Yes. But male communist ""allies"" just regard porn under the slogan ""sex work = work"", ignoring that sex work includes the oppression of the working class + the oppression of sexualization and being dominated as a woman. I hate porn industry, and I hate that it gets defended so much. They say that porn isn't ""derogatory"" and that it should be recognized as a legit job that needs legit oppression and just go on ignoring all the sex trafficking and ex actresses' speeches while justifying their position on the speech of some bourgeois sex workers. And you know why? Because they enjoy porn and can't get over the fact that they enjoy rape and abuse and that they are not the moral impecable people they pretend they are. Also they don't really care about women enough to know that selling their bodies an consenting to sexual acts they otherwise wouldn't consent to is actually perpetuating the issues feminists fight against. I just hate it."

The Bionian (or it could be post-bionian, I'm not sure) is a psychoanalytic approach that is not all that focused on archeology and repression (as in the freudian model) or the fantasies and movements from paranoid-schizoid position to the depressive position (as in the Kleinian model, the object-relations one). It's more about the developing of tools for thought making (as I understand it, is an approach focused on making less rigid defenses and helping the analysand in developing their reflective capacities, along with many other things).

I'd think of the Lacanian approach as a revisted Freudian aproach.
