 I get your perspective here, def not looking for an argument either. I thought it was gatekeepy as an initial reaction, but it's such a short exchange (I didn't go back and read any additional comments, just going off of the screenshot) that I guess it really could be either way. so your perspective is valid too.


 and to play devils advocate for OP I think he posted here because people can relate to the feeling of being dismissed/invalidated wrt their colourblind troubles (like the other commenter here who posted about being called a ""liar"" for correctly guessing a colour)."
ColorBlind,fr62pfp,t1_fr60qd9,1589918873.0,"my issue is when he insists that what OP said was challenging for them, was not in fact challenging for them. whether or not the exchange is rude or not i guess depends on how he would respond to the final comment, he could either acknowledge his mistake and move on, or dig his heels in and continue insisting on his first point. OP might've jumped the gun on calling him rude, but like the other commenter said it *can* be read as accusatory.


not really sure what your point about shades is. certain shades of colours are definitely easier to get mixed up. ex for me a darker shade of red is more easily confused with brown, or a lighter shade of brown is more easily confused with green, etc. etc."

television,fr3oxmf,t1_fr3mvq4,1589862413.0,"my feeling that i came away with is that the procedural shtick is meta. by the end of the first season it subverts the typical formula in some interesting ways, without getting into spoilers the individual cases start taking more of a personal toll on will. i think the show's format changing so dramatically ties into the way the characters change in a sense. after that point it only briefly revisits the procedural stuff in season 2, then moves on to being it's own thing from then out.


however if the over-the-top surreal stuff and... verbose dialogue isn't really your style, you might not find anything to like even at the ""good part."" it gets artsier and weirder with each episode. season 3 leans really heavily on the surrealism and visuals. i loved it, but i can see how it'd be a turn-off for some."

i can agree solidly on one point in your comment: the gore overall (including joel's scene) gives me a bit of a bad feeling, i understand why -- the violence was meant to be uncomfortable in the first game, and they're going further on those themes -- but some of it looks genuinely sickening and i worry it lacks some restraint. even though i know that's *the point,* i think it might honestly be too far for me in some respects.


otherwise,



playing as the killer, again, no way for me to feel comfortable saying that it's always a bad idea. i've been pleasantly surprised by protag swaps before.


>Killing Joel off like a rat with only the external context that 'he was a bad guy' doesn't evoke anything but confusion, dismay, and a real aggravating sense of disappointment.

my feeling based on what we know of the game's direction so far, and based on the themes of the first one, is that it's not quite that joel was ""a bad guy,"" more that he's *just* a guy, and the game wants us to realize that just because we know his story, doesn't mean he's any more important in this violent, uncaring world. again i could be wrong, but don't you think it's possible they want us to feel aggravated and reflect on why it might make us feel that way? hence the protag change? my comparison to MGS2 comes in here... that game really wanted us to wish we could've been playing as Solid Snake, it knew you were going to be feeling those negative emotions and used that to tell it's story.


too early to say IMO.

I really don't know how anyone can *actually* play the first game and genuinely expect an Avengers or Logan style of fan-service reverence for the character deaths in the sequel. it just doesn't make sense to me. it's a completely bullshit comparison... TLOU is closer in tone to The Road than any superhero movie or rockstar game lmao.



I think there's a serious mismatch between fan expectations and the reality of what the first game actually was. the more i see posts like the OP image here the more I recognize the similarities to the initial reaction towards Metal Gear Solid 2. 


also holy fuck can I just say it's such a relief to see someone here recognize that the first game had meta themes about player violence already and this is just an expansion on that. I feel like I'm living in a different universe when people ignore this hugely important established theme in favour of thinking the game is a strictly literal father-daughter roadtrip story.


I do have my own concerns about the game, this isn't an ND fanboy defense, but just a plea for people to just fuckin see what the creator is *trying to accomplish* and judge it on *that,* not how it stacks up to a fuckin marvel movie. whether this all will work or not is up in the air. could be shit, could be brilliant, could be mediocre. no use getting outraged over nonsense."

DevilMayCry,fqewz3n,t3_gi2b50,1589314973.0,"yes, i would've liked to have seen more interesting behaviour from basic enemies. one or two very passive punching-bag type enemies is fine, but 5 goes overboard on this. the fodder ants should've been at the level hell cainas are currently at, and the cainas should've been more resillient and aggressive on higher difficulties. the roots are pointless garbage and shouldn't be in the game. i hope they take notes for a hypothetical DMC6 and implement enemies that are actually capable of countering some player strategies, some sort of anti-juggling move on higher difficulties, i agree with you there.


another thing is that there's a lot of DMC1-style weaknesses / shortcuts to easily deal with enemies. these are super neat and fun to figure out, but unlike DMC1 the enemies are already very easy, so there's no punishment if you make a mistake. you can one-hit scissors, you can completely humiliate nobodies by parrying their masks, you can reflect hellbat fireballs, etc, but there's no real consequence for fucking any of these strategies up. so in addition to generally being overly passive and easy to fight through regular means, there's also a built-in easy button. *if you fuck up parrying a scissor, just use cavaliere lol ezgame. if you fuck up reflecting a hellbat, dude, hellbats have like no health bar, just hit them a couple times with anything and they'll melt.*




the part of your post i really disagree with is bosses... they're much easier than previous games, this i will concede, but idunno, i think they're pretty fun here. i am a pretty big fan of cav angelo and king cerberus. vergil is too slow and simple, which is slightly disappointing, but the gimmicks in that fight are pretty satisfying at least. goliath is fine, nothing special at all but he kinda fits in with the berial type of easy introduction boss but with some neat environmental quirks. final urizen is pretty good. V's bosses are the weakest links. everything else is decent but not super memorable. i'd say there are more good bosses in this game overall than 4 honestly, although 4's *best* bosses (credo, dante) are much better. if that makes sense.


i'm gonna throw you an upvote because you're actually discussing the *game* part of these *games.* i appreciate that.


anyway thank god for the community, i would've gone back to 3/4 by now but 5 is definitely my favourite when it's modded up (and i really love dante's weapons here). if i were capcom, i'd just hand a chunk of change to the SSSiyan table devs and etc. and use their ideas in a 5:SE lol."

at the end of the day, I think it's reasonable to say that nothing will change unless The People In Charge make some changes. however Gamers are usually horrible at figuring out who actually does what -- I see just as many people acting like Anita Sarkeesian is the fuckin CEO of ND or something lol.

standard quickstep doesn't have iframes and the perfect dodge's invincibility runs out as you exit the roll, so maybe your problem is that you're dodging into other enemies too often. 



or there could be a latency issue? input delay will always make timing windows harder. try enabling ""game mode"" on your TV or monitor if you haven't.

-not secure in the event of your dog bolting. the thin wire cannot be grabbed if this happens or if you drop the handle. a plastic handle will never be as secure as simply wrapping a rope style leash around your hand. the wires are usually cheap/shitty and may snap more easily under pressure than a conventional leash. plus, rope burn.



-other dogs on these may pose a risk to your own dog. in the event that one is aggressive, it becomes nearly impossible to easily pull them away in time.



-not *always* the case, but it often reinforces bad habits/behaviour for your dog. if a dog is used to total free reign on their walks, they'll believe that pulling will get them what they want, and they often won't have a concept of exactly how close to stay/how long the leash extends, which in a worst case scenario can cause injury if they are unexpectedly jerked back. I had to completely retrain a dog of mine that I got from a family friend who had been on one of these for two years. he pulled constantly.

PS4,fpkun7k,t1_fpkcw62,1588701326.0,"well, my short answer would be simply *i don't know.* of all the leaked content, only a small percentage of it is >!abby-related!< apart from all the >!joel murdering. i don't really know what her personality or arc is going to look like, all i know is what she does in the three cutscenes of her in the leak (two of which are just her murdering joel).!<


if we take MGS2 as an example again, (and by the way fuck it i'm just gonna spoiler tag the whole rest of this comment) >!that game forced you to play as a complete nobody for the sake of elevating Snake to legendary status. to make you miss Snake. all of those emotions the player felt when being stuck with Raiden (confusion, frustration, denial) were part of the game's plan, which was mainly to tell it's crazy meta-narrative, but apart from all that, in a simpler way, it was to develop Raiden as a character.!<


>!all of this is to say that making the player sympathize with Raiden was an uphill battle, nobody wanted to play as him, just like this, but it worked out for that game. there's obviously a lot more to how they made Raiden work as a character, but i don't want this comment to be super bloated. the point is -- it all depends on execution.!<


>!TLOU2 seems to be taking a similar but inverse approach. we switch characters not to elevate Joel, but to bring him back down to the rest of the world -- just because he is loved by the audience doesn't make him any less human than the random NPCs he slaughters by the dozen, and that's why i think Abby was chosen to be a random NPCs daughter -- it's a bit contrived, but it could potentially serve the themes of the story if it's done well. i think determining who is playable and when is a unique advantage to video games, there's a lot of potential there. Abby could end up sympathetic, or we could end up hating her the whole time, i don't know. it could go in some other crazy interesting direction that is impossible for me to foresee. or it could end up being pointless and shitty.!<"

unfortunately given how profitable reactionary anti-SJW hot-takes are these days, I think this is inevitable -- regardless of how good or bad the game actually is. it seems like some people actively want to be outraged.


it sucks, but I guess it's best to just try and tune those people out and worry about judging the game on its own merits, not the echo chambers of toxic Gamer Rage."
PS4,fpihd7v,t1_fpig01u,1588640932.0,"I'd disagree that Joel's was a noble cause, his decisions were understandable and I felt a ton of sympathy for him, but I feel like the game wanted us to ultimately view him as a broken, selfish man.



that's the beauty of that ending though, I guess! everyone can come away from it with a different perspective because it's so morally complex. and beautifully ambiguous. 



and to clarify, I think you misinterpreted a part of my comment. I wasn't saying that the ""cycle of revenge"" was a theme in the first game or that Joel was killing for the sake of revenge. just that it's a theme that could work in the sequel because of the undertones of empathy/discomfort around violence in the first game. my bad if I wasn't clear on that point."
PS4,fpie911,t1_fpiajxw,1588639109.0,"Naughty Dog games have always struck me as relatively risk averse, so to see such an ambitious concept is pretty interesting. regardless of how it turns out this is a much more creative angle for a sequel than simply going for fanservice, so I can respect that.



since this isn't a complete dumpster fire of a thread like some other places that shall remain unnamed, this is as good of a place as any to dump all my thoughts:



I find it weird that people have already made up their minds that this game ""ruins"" the themes of the first game. Uncharted games have made relatively light-hearted pokes at the extreme dissonance of Drake being a ""good guy"" despite slaughtering thousands, but TLOU delved a bit deeper into that concept by playing it straight and making it part of the world. Joel's body count is canon, you are a murderer, and your actions have consequences. the game consistently attempted to distill a sense of discomfort or even empathy for the human beings you are blasting into chunks. seeing an enemy hunter beg for their lives at gunpoint is pretty bleak. it all tied into the literal narrative of the game pretty smoothly.




the whole ""cycle of revenge"" angle Druckmann is pushing seems like a pretty natural continuation and expansion of that, by forcing you to empathize with / be in the shoes of >!somebody who brutally murders your previous playable character as a consequence for your actions in the previous game.!< it brings what I thought was an underrated aspect of the first game into the forefront. people say >!they don't want to play as Abby, that it would make them uncomfortable,!< but that might be part of the point -- similar to Raiden in MGS2.



that said, I've always thought Naughty Dog's writers excelled at writing character dialogue more than anything else. I really don't know if they are capable of pulling off such a crazy plot. I hope they are."
PS4,fpi87b0,t1_fpi5iba,1588635612.0,"not OP, but MGS2 is a masterpiece.



 best case scenario for TLOU2, it will be remembered as a similarly ballsy and genius move. I think the plot has potential, it all comes down to execution at this point. some things seem a bit contrived to me, but who knows. I feel that similarly to how some people feel about Kojima, there are people who are going to go into this *wanting* to hate it.



worst case scenario, the game isn't very good and the world moves on for normal human beings that don't feel the need to harrass game devs.



even if TLOU2 ends up being fantastic, Kojima got death threats back in the day for the bold decisions he made. hopefully the folks over at ND make it through the whole outrage. and I hope to fuck crunch culture is eradicated. I'd imagine the combination of those two issues could be really hard on the mental health of the devs."

it's just a protagonist switch!


i wonder what the response would be if MGS2 happened today, the controversy of not getting to play as snake would've been even bigger. or if raiden was a woman. lmao. these people would be shitting their pants.

druckmann has basically just said nice things about her before.

DevilMayCry,fpc724i,t3_gcfghf,1588489790.0,"i feel like there hasn't really been a perfect fit in the series yet. i think the values for DMC5s ranks could've used a bit of tweaking, there's a few seemingly arbitrary ""difficulty spikes"" for getting S ranks, notably mission 10. i'd have preferred more consistent behaviour from the ranking system here, sometimes you can get away with extremely sloppy play and even deaths, and sometimes there's comparatively very little room for error.


the way style points are calculated is much vaguer than 3 or 4 -- the goal becomes maintaining an average across the mission and each mission has a difference in the base value of point accumulation. plus, damage dealt while at high ranks is more important IIRC, which disincentives fighting optional battles that have weak enemies, as it might drag your average down even if you play well. none of this is immediately clear at first, so i think simply giving more information to the player would've helped a lot. even the way levels are broken up into ranked ""zones"" is super vague and unhelpful.


that said, eliminating orb and speed requirements (especially the fucking orbs) helps a ton. it's an improvement overall from 4. fewer annoying enemies like chimeras helps too. getting every S rank in 4 is so un-fun that i abandoned that goal on DMD mission 13(?)."

residentevil,fpc1pjt,t1_fpc04ue,1588484821.0,"red9's high individual firepower makes it great for precision shots, quick and easy melee kills, and ammo conservation. it just depends on your playstyle and preference. the blacktail is technically better for pure DPS. the red9 is also uhhhhh cool as shit. c'mon? that reload animation? cool factor's gotta count for something.

besides -- he's already bought it now, so selling it back would be a net loss.

 i've also played a million times, and more recently have always ran the blacktail, but ultimately i found myself missing the classic red9.


i agree that it's obviously his first playthrough, but that doesn't mean he should avoid the weapons he finds fun just because they're not technically optimal in your eyes. the reason the upgrade system in RE4 is so fun is because of how personal and open-ended it is. 

if anything, i'd say one should probably save the whole min/maxing total optimization stuff for later on a professional playthrough, where actually playing well is more important. the game's pretty generous with cash on normal and leaves plenty of room for mistakes/figuring out preferences on your own."
