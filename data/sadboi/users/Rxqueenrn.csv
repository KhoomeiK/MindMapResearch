Sorry maybe not always an optimist maybe a nihilist...that is one thing you can always be when you have nothing else"
AskReddit,fde4ooo,t3_ekdrs6,1578331109.0,I try to be an eternal optimist and just say tomorrow will be a better day and chances for the hope of joy keep me going....some might say it’s a simpleton’s way to think but it’s a rather complex experience to pull off
