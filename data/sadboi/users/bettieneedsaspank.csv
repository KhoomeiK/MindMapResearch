SuicideWatch,fnm5nrw,t3_g2jkre,1587065522.0,"I tried to commit suicide a year ago this month. I said I was going to change my life for the better and yet I'm still exactly where I was, more miserable than ever just floating through quarantine because I dont want to fail and end up putting more pressure on hospitals.
I have no friends, only my partner, who I very much do not get on with and have fallen pretty deep into depression. I dont know how to cope with the fact that in a full year I've accomplished nothing and became a worse person. Life sucks"

BreakUps,f3rt0uv,t1_f3ravcy,1571091411.0,"wow, that last bit hit me really hard. 
iâ€™ve been letting what we had rule what i can have now and iâ€™ve been so focused on it i didnâ€™t even think about what it was taking away from me really. iâ€™ve only thought about what i â€˜couldâ€™ have in the future. maybe itâ€™s time to stop worrying about hurting him by messaging him and moving on by not. i donâ€™t necessarily want to but i think thatâ€™s probably normal"
BreakUps,f3rsfcv,t1_f3r6gwo,1571091292.0,"we ended because neither of us messaged which sounds silly, so i donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s good terms but he unfriended me on stuff so i feel like heâ€™s moving on with life and i donâ€™t wanna set him back"
offmychest,f347mft,t3_dfmdsf,1570650945.0,"Honestly, you need to see a psychologist. This sounds like it could be bipolar to me (definitely not diagnosing you!) with the reckless decisions and not thinking about what youâ€™re doing but Iâ€™m obviously not a doctor. 
Cheating on your partner and still living with him without telling him is awful- think how youâ€™d feel in his shoes. You need to tell him and break up with him, itâ€™s time you dealt with the consequences."
