The other reason is because it relaxes people, takes away stress, gives some people energy and makes them feel warm like they have a blanket that’s just right wrapped around their body.

Can’t do much about it though, the perception of it is going to stay if you’re pain tolerance stays or you’ve done damage and you’d be better off not taking them.

suboxone,fr013ue,t3_gloid9,1589780693.0,"To be honest if it was me, I’d stop taking the subs now. Sub withdrawals are worse than oxy withdrawals,although not as intense the duration makes up for it. Oxy withdrawals suck, don’t get me wrong but it can be a lot worse. Subs are supposed to be taken 1 of 2 ways, depending on who you ask. Some addicts say use them for a few days and then quit, probably the best for illegally gotten subs or a limited supply, or use them long term and taper off, usually when it’s a script and the doctors looking after them or if you are really good at volumetric dosing tapering or cutting them into tiny strips.

I’ve trained diabetes dogs and seizure dogs before and the way they can smell those events (drop in blood sugar, pre seizure) before they happen in people, is nothing short of amazing. Accuracy can be super high, but it depends on the dog AND trainer. As far as you’re friends being close to police dogs, doesn’t necessarily mean they were drug dogs or that they had real drugs, or if the dogs are trained to detect when they aren’t working, like was the dog off duty? Dogs do distinguish between working and not by association.

I work in a small grocery store with an identity crisis( it has EVERYTHING!! Produce, liquor, medicine, barbecue supplies, wine, milk, cheese, meat and we only have 3 employees and two owners for a 14 hour open, 17 hours post pandemic) and people tend to ask the same kind of bullshit questions. We see about 600- 1500 people everyday, we aren’t designed for this panic buying mode and people getting worse everyday. They move slower and slowe the longer they are laid off, old people tend to come to our store because it’s close to their houses and they take forever at the register and don’t pay attention to what’s right in front of them. People always ask me for certain flavors of ice cream or where the bread is(AT THE FRONT!!right behind you!!) among other things, have me open produce bags for them and I can’t because my fingers are too dry. We don’t even have a good space to bag $200 dollars worth of groceries so h e groceries sit on top of themselves and I’m almost getting injured everyday because I can’t even fit through the store because it’s a corner store and people try to dodge me, I have arthritis in my fingers from all the work. Needless to say with the safety hazards, no bonus pay and pain in the ass slow pokes I’ve put in my two weeks and am moving out of the west coast to where people actually work as a team. My suggestion to everyone with a multitasking job or job that’s bad for introverts. QUIT NOW!! It’s bad for your brain and you’ll have a hard time building anything outside of work."
retailhell,fq6lem7,t3_gfu7ik,1589133771.0,"People are just ignorant, straight up. I cant blame them, honestly before I worked retail I used to leave bad reviews and good reviews. Now I just tend to leave good reviews, because retail is usually overworked. There are TONS of lazy people in big city’s on the west coast where I am, but there are also lots of hard workers and it’s soo difficult to know if that persons job are they overworked? Lazy? Or is it just a bad day? Is it managements fault? I don’t leave 1 Star ratings anymore and I avoid sounding like this person, I try to just leave room for improvements and leave a 2-3 star and if they change the behavior on the next go around I immediately change it to a positive review. and show some love to the places I really like with some 5 star reviews."
opiates,fq1ablr,t1_fpyu1mp,1589043755.0,I’d say it sounds like heartburn. Maybe try a long acting acid reducer? Cimetidine or omeprozalam or whatever.
medical,fpxs4ov,t3_gg47re,1588988461.0,"That’s pretty normal for me actually. I’ve had elbows that look like that from time to time for the majority of my life. But it disappeared when I got older. Do you have acne? Are you a guy or gal? It could be dryness, or hormones, I wouldn’t worry bless it burns."
rareinsults,fpxrg97,t1_fpw65nm,1588988071.0,"Real answer is that they are poor. Bad diet, competition with other races that cling to their cultural identity, for shit jobs, gives them an entitlement complex, “they took Er johbs!!!” Just like all of the people that blame any race, entity, government or mythological creature for their woes. It’s laziness and lazy people tend to have bad genes or a sedentary lifestyle that leads to their looks. People are shit, is the short answer."
introvert,fpvzixk,t1_fpvs9ys,1588954627.0,"Very true. Born into a stupid culture, we work to appeal to morning larks and extroverted lifestyles, just so we don’t rebel against a government that doesn’t give a shit about us. It’s all a sham. We should make a counter cultural work environment, where introverts can be free. It’s tough that all of the introvert jobs you have to get t a degree for and my social anxiety was so bad I couldn’t complete school. So many problems that’ll never be addressed because that’s the way it is."
introvert,fpvz5oh,t3_gfn5jy,1588954438.0,"Jesus, I wish I could. I work in a grocery store and this shit is absolute hell. To all the introverts on here that don’t have to work or work from home, please don’t sleep walk through grocery stores and be slow. They aren’t safe because people just browse around taking their sweet ass time. It’s horrible. Enjoy this and maybe find a way to change you’re lifestyle? Happy for you homie, sad for me."
Stims,fpvylsg,t1_fpvkc3c,1588954159.0,You ever boof bruh?
suboxone,fpvyd4q,t3_gfrsuk,1588954036.0,"Yes, it’s fine as long as you don’t push either together. Subs are a depressant and addys a stim so it can be hard on the heart if you high dose both. I would suggest maybe taking one in the morning and one in the afternoon? They kind of mute each other if they are taken at the same time"
