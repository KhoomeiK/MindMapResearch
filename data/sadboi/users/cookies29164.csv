socialanxiety,fqh6ncr,t3_giu7bl,1589369471.0,"Socially anxious here too! I’d say, go alone and take the risk. In the worst case, you will have a mental breakdown. If it goes well however, you might learn tips and tricks on how to deal with your anxiety. You might even connect with people and lift some of that anxiety off your shoulders! 

In my college years I was SUPER socially anxious and every time I tried to talk to someone, I ended up going home and crying in my bedroom alone. But, I’m glad I can say I gave it a shot and I learned from it. You can only come out of this experience with gaining more knowledge and being a better human for it.

Best of luck to you"

depression,fpfzow8,t3_gd2oik,1588589496.0,"I’ve come to realize being “sad” doesn’t mean you lost all hope. But being depressed does. I realized that hope really is such a precious thing to have. 

All I can say is to remember your past to your 15 yr, 10 yr old, or 5 yr old self. Remember the one moment you were loving life. That time when you didn’t feel like dying, when you didn’t hate who you were, and when you had dreams. You can have that once again. That’s the only hope you can cling onto."

depression,fj6b6rj,t3_fblcx0,1583065608.0,"“Existence is pain,” a quote from rick and morty comes to mind when I read this lol. I truly believed this with all my heart after I just landed my first job after college. But I recently decided that I’m not going to be sad about my life anymore and I am going to earn money to learn the things I truly love, which is the arts. I get it... if you live by yourself and are struggling to make ends meet, it is so much harder to go after your dreams. I am fortunate enough to live with my parents and be okay with it. But I think what helped me get (a little) excited about life is that I am an adult now and I can literally shape my life in any way I want (or however much I allow myself to). If I am going to exist here on this boring planet, I’m at least going to strive for extraordinary things like going to outer space, joining the military, becoming a musician and performing for a little crowd, starting a small business, learning how to ride a motorcycle, getting my PhD, etc... these dreams sound unachievable but that’s because I tend to get stuck in the mentality that I need to  achieve it now. But I have my whole life to pursue those things. And I think that is cool. :)

Also, if you’re depressed, but you get an opportunity to go to outer space, wouldn’t you take it?! It would be freakin cool!"

Maybe the negative things aren’t as true as you tell yourself they are. 

I guess you are feeling so defeated and tired of living. And your feelings are totally valid. But let’s not leave yourself there. Your life CAN get better. Maybe your circumstances may not immediately improve but you can definitely FEEL better and love yourself again. Not by making more money or getting a boyfriend or looking better, but understanding the truth that you are an awesome person deserving of love but deprived of these things. And therefore the efforts to improve your life is NOT wasted on you. You deserve a community of people who love and support you to make you feel like you’re gonna be okay. Yes sure we make mistakes too, but there are a lot of assholes out there who just don’t know how to respond correctly to things.

socialanxiety,evrwksl,t3_ckw1r1,1564720808.0,"Oh gosh this was so me for the last three years of my college life. I avoided everyone and never talked to anyone because I was afraid of people’s reactions to what I say or do. The few times I tried to say something or talk to someone, it wouldn’t go the way I planned it and I would go home and cry and be depressed because I felt like I had failed. But you know what? Don’t blame yourself for bad social interactions because it’s not always your fault. Some people are just rude and that isn’t your fault. Or some people also just don’t know how to respond and that isn’t your fault either. I’ve met some people who are super inclusive and some who are really exclusive. And sometimes you just don’t feel like you belong anywhere because everyone seems so foreign to you. But you will some day find your clique of people. Take your time to open up and reflect on your interactions. 

For me, I got a job as a waitress because I am forced to talk to people and it’s very simple things like, “are you ready to order?” For me, that small social interaction allows me to feel like I am in charge. They need ME to take their order. I have a reason to talk and they have a reason to listen. It helps me open up. And you can talk to fellow coworkers about work gossip and it’s fun. 

I hope you develop healthy thoughts about yourself. I’m sure you are a very interesting person :)"
