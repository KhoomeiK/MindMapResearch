relationship_advice,fpa9lc7,t3_gbzt6z,1588443596.0,"Dude, this totally sounds like an epic confrontation to me. Your bravery standing up to someone, ESPECIALLY your own family, in the face of a) never having done something like that before, and b) holding strong against her emotional manipulation + your mom's reaction, is FUCKING AMAZING in my book. Damn, I'm so inspired. Your crying/shaking doesn't discount in my book the STRENGTH you showed doing what you did. Damn!"
