EdgarAllanPoe,faa53hu,t1_fa9rg4b,1575902412.0,Griswold's letters are evidence that he was probably a little crazier than Poe.
EdgarAllanPoe,fa8b30q,t3_e7y6aw,1575843769.0,"He was quite sociable and humorous and dressed well. He was known to perform readings for fans locally here in Richmond. He got the name Allan from his adopted family, the Allan's, after his mother passed away when he was a child. He was devastated by the death of his wife (and first cousin) Virginia Clemm Poe. He also lost the true love of his life, Elyra Shelton due to her father's interception of the letters he sent her. He did however get to be with her near the end of his life and was engaged to her at the time of his death. He was aware of a publisher in New York, Rufus Griswold (also Poe's arch nemesis for reasons explained later and somehow his literary executor). Griswold was putting together a volume of poetry from American writers, including Poe, who sent him dozens of poems. Griswold only included two of Poe's poems at the end of the volume. Poe was furious and hated Griswold. Eventually, in 1849 Poe is engaged to Elmyra Shelton and has plans to travel to New York. After a Doctor's visit (during which Poe was unwell and advised against travel) Poe left the office and took the doctor's walking stick (that had a blade built in) and left his own(now in the possession of the Poe Museum. He also left his suitcase (also in possession of the Poe Museum) at a nearby hotel where it was held as collateral as he was unable to pay his bill. After departing Richmond he arrived in Baltimore and disappeared for three days. He was found 3 days later sitting sleepily in a park seemingly in a daze and not wearing his own clothes and calling for Richardson (I think). It is still unknown who he was calling for. He died on October 7th, 1849. He sat up in his hospital bed and exclaimed ""God help my poor soul."" and promptly died. Rufus Griswold wrote his obituary, which began ""Edgar Allan Poe is dead..."" and proceeded to absolutely trash Poe and Poe's reputation as a means of tarnishing Poe's legacy. It backfired and caused a great interest in Poe and gave the world the reputation we still know today. 
Source: Interned at the Poe Museum and the curator is a good friend of mine."
