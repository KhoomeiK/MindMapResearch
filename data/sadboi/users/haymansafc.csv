>Improvement doesn't happen over night, and is a consistent process.

Indeed, this is true also. There's no specific time frame. Some people, like myself, can spend years of our lives doing what we can to improve our lives. In some cases it works and in others, unfortunately myself included, where you can do what you can but it makes not one jot of difference. I only wish those who repeat the same old phrase and pieces of generic advice accept that we have made effort and that, for whatever reason, those efforts haven't been acknowledged. 

Personally speaking, I'm proud of the steps I've taken in order to 'bring me out of my shell' more. Given I deal with bouts of depression and social anxiety - it's certainly no easy feat. I've done things outside of my comfort zone which whilst I'm pleased of doing, hasn't seen my image improve or be respected any more than it did previously. It's been an incredibly frustrating process.

For me, I limit my social exposure. Far from ideal of course, but in turn this limits the criticisms, personal questions, jokes and stigmatisation I often face when I attend any social get-together. I'll only go to such events if absolutely necessary. Even then, I find myself 'clock watching' waiting for the end to come. 

I accept that this probably isn't good for my mental health but as someone who deals with Social Anxiety and bouts of depression (largely because I remain a dateless virgin with no lifetime progressions), it's the lesser of both evils. I'm much less frustrated than I used to be. That's for sure..."
FA30plus,fdgxor0,t3_el1jwb,1578410877.0,"Hmmm... An interesting one. In my humble opinion, I'd cut ties and move on. Experience over the years has taught me that having no friends is better than those who aren't really 'friends' by it's definition. 

Having no friends is far from ideal, but lesser of both evils. I had a few people I'd consider to be 'toxic' who clung on towards the end of my teens. I found them to be problematic, time consuming and frustrating. Once they'd walked out of my life, I honestly felt like a huge weight had been lifted from my shoulders. I went ten years with no friends at all. 

Then, back in 2015, purely by chance I bumped into my former best friend who I hadn't seen face-to-face in those ten years. Cutting a long story short he wanted me to remain in touch and at that time, I was trying different methods to improve my social life. So, I did... In previous years (and what I'd do again now) is to basically not stay in touch. 

Anyway, we met up a few times since then for drinks and it become apparent after even after the first meeting that the reasons why I no longer wanted him in my life were still there - if not even stronger. He was still blaming me for all-sorts, too extroverted (which he never was until around the age of 16) and incredibly self-centered. We did meet up for a few months following this, but the meet-ups quickly become less frequent following that and now, I don't think I've seen him for around two years. Maybe a little more. 

Again, the sense of relief that I had back when we first went our separate ways (at the age of 20) was there.  

So from my experience, it's better to not look back. No matter how tempting it may be. Just keep looking ahead."
IncelsWithoutHate,fdgp75z,t3_ekvh7y,1578404622.0,"For me, I socialise very little (I've made my best efforts in the past to little avail) and when I do, I'm generally selective of who I go out with. I'm not interested in socialising with people who have past experience of ignoring me, joking about me or stigmatising me.

FA30plus,fddmxsc,t3_ekslpa,1578318194.0,"I'm a member of both and as already described, the biggest challenge 'ForeverAlone' faces is that it's starting to become toxic thanks to 'Braincels' being banned. It's exactly the same scenario over at 'IncelsWithoutHate', which I'm sorry to see. If the moderators don't act, I will be genuinely surprised if either of them see out the year without being banned - which would be a shame because there's plenty of decent people there. 

I'm actively trying to cut down my participation on 'ForeverAlone' as I don't want to relate or mix with people who aren't entirely coherent, reasonable and unwilling to sensibly debate. I certainly won't tar everyone there with the same brush. Far from it. It's just a shame that what was once a minority on there appears to have grown notably over the last four months or so. 

I also find that the majority of contributors there are either in their teens. Nothing wrong with that as such, but I'm sure most of us here can sit and roll our eyes at silly comments made about writing themselves off when they're still in education and haven't really experienced 'real life' yet. Classic teenage angst. I have no doubt the vast majority of them will vanish from Reddit within a couple of years once they realise they were just impatient rather than actually being 'Forever Alone' or indeed an incel. 

Generally speaking, I won't get involved in conversation with them as I've wasted time in the past trying to explain. Once they get into their late twenties and find themselves in the same boat, I'll start giving them much more thought and indeed, respect for the plight they face. For example from my own experience, looking back, I'd say the 'upward hill battle' become close to vertical once I got to around 25. These are when genuinely 'grown up' problems with being an incel, forever alone e.t.c start to really make themselves known."
depression,fddd1q3,t3_doqwow,1578306438.0,"I'm sorry I'm very late to this topic but I agree entirely. 

I appreciate the intentions may be good, but from previous experiences there are times when the conversation reaches a natural end - but the other person simply won't stop responding. I've had three definite experiences of this in the past where after a few messages back and fourth, I just want to be left alone and continue. I don't want to remain in private contact but there's no polite way of putting this across to the other person. 

Prior to my time on Reddit, there was one particular forum I was a member of who private messaged me for many months. Probably getting on for a year. In the end, I just had to stop replying and inevitably ended up blocking that person when they continued to message me for weeks afterwards - turning quite nasty. 

As my own personal rule, I don't and haven't responded to any private messages for around a year. I don't mean to offend anyone by that but after several 'less than pleasant' experiences and then the expectation to remain in contact thereafter - I've just had to call it a day and say ""*enough's enough*"". I'll stick to responding to comments in the public domain."

It seems to be this factor which determines how far along you get in life these days, rather than qualifications. It's *who* you know - rather than *what* you know. 

Going back around eight years, I sought professional help for the regular bouts of depression I go through, as well as Social Anxiety. It wasn't successful but there were bits and pieces of advice I picked up so it wasn't a completely wasted exercise. I also bought several self help books shortly afterwards and those genuinely were neither use nor ornament to me. The advice given, similar to actually seeing people, was actions I was already carrying out and either completely failing at or we're known trigger points. 

I turn 35 in April. I've long since known I'm not going to be the life and soul of the party. I've improved in a few ways since the back end of my 20's and I'm pleased I've gained at least a little self-confidence in myself. Socialising is still a real struggle and strain on me though and at my age, I can't see that changing.

Alternatively, I'll be a chatterbox but this is when I usually open myself wide open to the usual criticisms of ""*not taking a breath whilst talking*"", accused of talking too quickly, accused of being wrong and often stuttering words if I've not predicted the direction of the conversation correctly.

It's one of the most anxiety-inducing and depression-raising times of the year for myself and no doubt many others here. I loathe New Year and have done for around half my lifetime now, I'd say. 

New Year? So what...? New Decade? ""*Meh*"", I'd say. Nothing ever changes. One day is very similar to the next and they all roll into one for me.

There are a few forums out there (not directly incel-related, but have boards for life-long single people) but unfortunately, the moderators certainly don't like these problems being discussed.

By that, I mean where I probably still had some sort of chance if not only I pushed myself (difficult with Social Anxiety and Depression) but found a woman in her early/mid twenties willing to date a dateless, virgin man. 

Fast forward to 2020 and those hopes have long since diminished, I'm afraid to say. Nothing changed or progressed for me during the entire decade. I'm just a joke to people who know me and that's regardless of what I've done in recent years.

We currently have one van out on the road with six different deliveries to make.

It costs more to open than it does to give staff a proper Christmas break which no doubt they'd respect more.

Not the mainline. All too often I come across people who will match your speed perfectly and then sit absolutely parallel to you - expecting you to move over. Nothing is stopping them, in the lane that has to give way, to ease off the throttle to merge in behind, or speed up and merge ahead.

IncelsWithoutHate,fbaemcg,t3_ecakc4,1576675956.0,"I haven't personally come across another face-to-face (that I'm aware of) and at the age of 34, the chances of meeting one of similar age outside of the likes of forums is slim to none. 

In terms of 'solidarity', it depends on how that other person (or people)  portray themselves. If they can communicate properly and debate reasonably with respect, I probably would. If they revert to using the same old tedious phrases and swearing, then I won't. I'll distance myself. 

There's really no point in beating yourself up about it and calling yourself 'subhuman'. It doesn't help the situation."
depression,fbadqpz,t3_ebznqv,1576675182.0,"I understand. What tends to happen for me is that the one thing that goes wrong is usually at the start of the day. As a result, near enough the whole day is wrecked from there on in. To make matters worse, on top of that, it's usually a working day.

To me, the problem I face in such cases is enormous. Yet on the occasions I've felt brave enough to open up, I've often been looked at oddly as if it's not a problem at all, or at best, it's been 'downgraded' and compared to someone else's non-related issue. 

So much for society telling people to 'open up'. We've still got a very long way to go in this respect..."
FA30plus,fba30cr,t3_ebq0j2,1576661832.0,"My sympathies are with you, there... I absolutely loathe social Christmas events with a passion.  

Our works' Christmas party was last weekend and fortunately, I managed to avoid it. It just isn't for me... Judging from the mood of one of the bosses on Monday, it looks as if not many actually turned up anyway. I know for a fact no one in our office attended and I think that's the first time that's happened in the time I've been with the company. No one has really been in the mood for one this year due to events over the course of this year - so it was quite an easy 'get out' clause. 

I believe the same boss is trying to arrange a drink at the local pub this Friday, straight after work. Needless to say, it's generated little interest and I have no intentions on going to that either. 

No one should be forced to attend social events with colleagues out-of-hours and it's something no one should be shamed for - which is unfortunately the case by more social people. Not everyone is a 'social butterfly'. To me, attending anything with colleagues just feels like unpaid overtime... I mean no offence to any of them, it's just not something which has ever appealed to me."
FA30plus,fba2md5,t3_ec95ce,1576661244.0,"No offence taken at all! I think a lot of us here like to post to get things off our chest and to give the benefit of our experience where applicable. 

I've not made any new year's resolutions for a number of years, now. The resolutions I need to make are those I continuously fail at and rather than continuing the age-old frustration, it's honestly better for me to try and put them to the back of my mind. As much as I can, anyway."
