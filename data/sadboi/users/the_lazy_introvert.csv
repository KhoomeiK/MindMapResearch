i realized last night that playing the sims is exactly like dealing with my adhd brain. here‚Äôs a couple of sentences i‚Äôve uttered while playing:

‚Äúi told you to go to work and you just have to stop and talk to every sim you see‚Äù

‚Äúif you‚Äôre hungry then eat, dammit! over here getting distracted by the tv and just standing there‚Äù

‚Äúi have to tell you to do *everything* dont i?‚Äù

our brains are literally like sims. we have to make ourselves do something before we learn to do it on our own. and we have to make ourselves do something to get rid of the bored or sad emotion. maybe try imagining you controlling yourself as a sim and see if that helps? adhd brains love games."

that. that word right there is the root of every perfectionist and procrastinator‚Äôs issues. they torture themselves into thinking that they have to do the work a certain way, sit there for however many hours -- a method that doesnt work well with the brain --  thus disabling themselves from doing anything at all bc they‚Äôve dictated themselves into thinking there‚Äôs no other way to do it. 

i noticed that the minute i stopped being angry with myself for getting distracted and just accepting the fact that it was gonna happen regardless of my wishes, it started happening less often and taking up less time. now when i get distracted while doing homework, it‚Äôs for like 30secs, and its a whole lot easier for me to say ‚Äúokay, back to work.‚Äù"
