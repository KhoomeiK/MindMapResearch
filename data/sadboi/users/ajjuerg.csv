DogMoms,fnmjzl6,t1_fnmipcf,1587072804.0,Aw thank you!
bipolar,flencun,t1_flen6qp,1585087697.0,True. I keep up with my psychiatrist and therapy appointments too. I just hope it's enough
bipolar,fhb5qrm,t1_fha2ur6,1581435381.0,And then overanalyze how you think they responded.
Goldendoodles,fh9veea,t1_fh9stkr,1581390500.0,"Yeah I make sure to watch my tone when I say his name to keep it positive and I reward the behaviors he should do. Again, he's a puppy and I'm guilty of having adult dog expectations but I think that's also because my experiences have been with adult dogs or very mature puppies. Adjustment period for us all."
bipolar,fh9v28e,t1_fh9t78m,1581390275.0,Right! My depressed phase will have me really questioning those final decisions of mania
bipolar,fh9jkxs,t1_fh972f1,1581382824.0,Right?! The conundrum
bipolar,fh8tvin,t1_fh8tjur,1581367270.0,I wish I could just be more confident in my decisions I guess
Goldendoodles,fh8ivxp,t1_fh8hbrm,1581360681.0,I just don't want him to not like me as much bc I'm too tough. He's only a puppy but I don't want to enable bad habits too early on.
Goldendoodles,fgqmvv3,t1_fgpyza3,1581027256.0,Ah gotcha. Thank you for your insight!!
Goldendoodles,fgpofb9,t1_fgpo28n,1581008864.0,When you say neutral area is it bad to bring our doodle to someone else's house to introduce dogs?
AlAnon,ffi2bwj,t1_ffhdvpw,1579963014.0,I'm so worried that he made a fool of himself in front of his co workers. He didn't even get his luggage. I'm trying to let him love with his decisions and not name them for him when he's drunk
AlAnon,ffi26vd,t1_ffhjiwf,1579962890.0,Would a fair boundary be he can't stay here if he drinks? I just don't want him to feel I'm abandoning him or giving up on him.
AlAnon,ffi21rp,t1_ffi1l04,1579962764.0,I guess now I have to figure out what MY rock bottom is too.
AlAnon,ffi1w7v,t1_ffhdhph,1579962626.0,It's so hard. I just want him to be okay
AlAnon,ffi0njo,t1_ffhod08,1579961474.0,I'm just so afraid bc his failure impacts me too. I know that sounds selfish but it does and I just worry. I know sober him would be so ashamed of drunk him. 2 different people.
bipolar,ff3jv2d,t1_ff2pb97,1579542594.0,Good point! Didn't think of that
bipolar,ff3jszj,t1_ff2yy5w,1579542560.0,Guess it doesn't hurt to ask
bipolar,ff1zy4u,t1_ff1zmuy,1579490144.0,Staying asleep is nearly impossible I'm about 6 or even 7 on a good day. And even that depends on when the medicine kicks in
bipolar,ff1zl2z,t1_ff1zgxm,1579489883.0,The med combo has improved now that the ativan has been introduced
bipolar,ff1ziy5,t1_ff1zgxm,1579489839.0,"Lamictal, Zyprexa, ambien, and ativan"
bipolar,ff1zanh,t1_ff1z5vf,1579489672.0,Comes in waves and I feel it coming back slowly so I gotta get prepared
bipolar,ff1z88g,t1_ff1yvrm,1579489623.0,I use support groups central online. They're online support groups which I love!
bipolar,ff1yr5x,t1_ff1xhbt,1579489282.0,Try practicing on a support group really digging deep and talking about the things you wish you could share. That way it's in a safer experience that may better prepare you for main publicity
bipolar,ff1y8gv,t1_ff1y178,1579488924.0,Yeah I used to be a part of an online support group for bipolar disorder but kept thinking I was fine. Still nice to have the sense of community
bipolar,ff1xp02,t1_ff1x4ly,1579488552.0,February 2017. I just don't want to open up and then something triggers a manic or depression episode. Gotta get control and learn how to control responses
bipolar,ff1ww72,t1_ff1wnd1,1579488034.0,I just want to be an open advocate for mental health but I'd feel like I'm lying if I don't describe my experiences. Guess I can find a work around without putting my experiences out bc I'm still dealing with having the disorder myself
BipolarReddit,fdiupwr,t3_elm9wg,1578451466.0,"From one sad person to the other keep your head up. Find the small things to give credit towards yourself. You get out of bed üëç, just a quick shower üëç, lay back down, reach out to friends and support üëç start small."
bipolar,fdisr0s,t1_fdiskho,1578450212.0,Looks cool! I'll check it out
bipolar,fdis545,t1_fdirov0,1578449825.0,"Ah someone understands! Great perspective though. Celebrate the little things like getting to work early, drinking good amounts of water, other care taking tasks. Those add up. Thank you!"
bipolar,fdi0kf6,t1_fdhbz4o,1578433584.0,It's hard to even get started bc I think of other things I could do and do anything but what I'm supposed to do. Vicious cycle
bipolar,fdh2lag,t1_fdh2h7i,1578414022.0,I know that all too well. Definitely my fear bc that is...mania!
GoldendoodleOwners,fddu0wg,t1_fdcukwm,1578323956.0,Awesome points. Thank you!
bipolar,fbh67oy,t1_fbfud7f,1576866239.0,"It's just one of those moments where you can't remember the reason you started the meds in the first place. One of those ""I'm fine"" moments that could really backfire. I just wish I didn't have to take them at all."
BipolarReddit,f3727hf,t1_f36ykp1,1570720562.0,Good points. Thank you for your insight!
BipolarReddit,f31kw8m,t1_f31dh4c,1570577996.0,Ohhh!!! Hoping I have a not so potty puppy lol
BipolarReddit,f30og26,t1_f30mqr5,1570558876.0,And you managed to overcome it or was it just oh I love you we'll keep going?
BipolarReddit,f302aiu,t1_f2zkgii,1570544748.0,"That's absolutely amazing! The connection I hope for. I hear so many stories about dogs being so intuitive of your feelings. 

In regards to the purpose I think that's something that I need instead of going through the motions just to get through the day. I started working out and that's starting to help but I'm hoping a new companion would help."
BipolarReddit,f3022py,t1_f2z35ca,1570544604.0,I never thought of it that way. You just love them and it all seems worth it because of what they give to you
BipolarReddit,f30101j,t1_f2z0x23,1570543858.0,That's my fear of the anxiety of puppy training!
BipolarReddit,f2ywysp,t1_f2ywstj,1570500423.0,So glad to hear! Thank you for sharing. Well worth the read
BipolarReddit,f2ywgox,t1_f2yw7oq,1570500079.0,I take care of my sister's dog from time to time and see her many times when visiting. Love her to pieces and my worries of the day fade but I'm just nervous bc it would be mine. Gratefully I have an amazing husband who is also very patient so we'll see
BipolarReddit,f2hvm9m,t1_f2hch0p,1570248824.0,"Definitely had those ""blackout"" moments. So crazy. My husband tells me constantly to just go to bed and to give him my phone bc I've made interesting posts and sent text messages."
bipolar,f1ghhtz,t3_d95pzn,1569467387.0,So me. Told my psychiatrist today I'm afraid of what will come after this manic episode passes
bipolar,f10xbhj,t1_f10wjzn,1569118417.0,Eventually the switch breaks and the thoughts stop bc you sleep but don't be surprised when you wake up in the middle of the night with more thoughts
bipolar,f10ignw,t1_f10i17b,1569113050.0,"Right, then rinse and repeat!"
bipolar,f0qmjuh,t3_d67pe3,1568862438.0,Also check out Polar Warriors YouTube channel but DEFINITELY go see a doctor asap to get the best treatment and diagnosis
BipolarReddit,f0q51gq,t1_f0q4ni9,1568854000.0,Thanks!! To you as well!
BipolarReddit,f0q4dj1,t1_f0q41cx,1568853652.0,Yes a personal trainer (yay!). I had one before but just wasn't feeling it at all. The only reason I went was because I was under contract not because I want to go. This new trainer said he's also a life coach sort of like you had. He said he wants to help with working on my motivation and mindset. Looking forward to the new journey towards better health. Heard working out is one of the best things you can do especially for bipolar.
BipolarReddit,f0q3qrn,t1_f0p018y,1568853324.0,Update: I have a meeting with a trainer for Friday
BipolarReddit,f0paq07,t1_f0p018y,1568830808.0,Yeah fair points. Thanks!
BipolarReddit,f0owup3,t1_f0nml0q,1568822070.0,You make very valid points. Gratefully I stick to my meds bc I definitely am afraid of what I'd be like off of them if I'm already messed up on them. It's just so hard to fight against the feelings especially when depressed. Just hard to get up. Don't want to do anything or go anywhere. I know I should workout but I don't because I just don't want to. I don't think my spouse really understands the fight I battle with daily. Just so challenging.
BipolarReddit,f0ovyko,t1_f0orvk1,1568821500.0,Very good ideas. I just have a bad problem of starting something and not finishing it. I cant tell you how many books I've purchased based on interest and still haven't finished them. It's like shiny ball syndrome ugh but the project point is spot on. I'm looking into becoming some sort of project manager. Not such tedious tasks but I get to work on something from finish to close and I don't have to worry about revisiting it or the same problem popping up.
bipolar,f0oqb22,t3_d5ynqg,1568817766.0,Just like with any other illness she can't truly be helped until she wants the help herself. I know that sounds harsh but without acceptance of the diagnosis it's hard to get on a track towards healing. Watch from a distance as you don't want to also develop codependency.
BipolarReddit,f0oprdc,t1_f0npi3c,1568817389.0,Thanks!! Glad to hear someone is living in a successful position not letting the disorder hinder you. That's awesome
BipolarReddit,f0okvt3,t1_f0nqi9b,1568813932.0,I didn't know either until I looked it up and saw so many people having the same struggle. It's something about our attention and tendencies to become bored once you're at a stable place in your job. Crazy experience but in trying to figure out how to stop.
BipolarReddit,f0novuq,t1_f0nom1j,1568775989.0,Same! I tailor my resumes to meet the requirements. I applied for like 5 a day too and I'd feel great but at the same time like omg I did it. I like going through the process. Getting the emails and screening  calls. It's like a high almost.
BipolarReddit,f0nojkr,t1_f0nodsw,1568775699.0,Are you wanting to get out? Or do you go through the motions through the process as more like a scratch for an itch.
BipolarReddit,f0noc3j,t1_f0no8dp,1568775525.0,So far no in person interviews but some screening calls.
BipolarReddit,f0nl2su,t1_f0mgodb,1568772935.0,Thank you for sharing your story. It's these opportunities that I appreciate most during my bipolar journey. I've STRUGGLED over the last 3 years since my diagnosis. Crazy rollercoaster of emotions and meds. I thought I was good on one dose and then boom depressive episodes almost nearing suicide. I swore to myself since my last attempt in 2012 that I wouldn't go to that dark place again. I've come pretty close but haven't opened that door. My therapist says I need to learn how to let the door be open but manage the flow of emotions. Rant redirected. It's been hard except the main thing I've been consistent in is taking my meds. I'm absolutely terrified of what I'd be like without them if I'm already pretty jacked up on them. Regular therapy helps a lot and this online support group I'm a part of. It's just hard going through every day not knowing if you're gonna have a breakdown especially at work. Long post short I'm doing as much as I can to minimize the chaos but it seems to always find me.
BipolarReddit,f0lthuw,t1_f0ltbxo,1568729158.0,"I really appreciate it and am thankful for your insight and help. Definitely reminds me that I'm not alone in what I'm going through. It's exhausting!! Is your burst of energy due to mania? If so, do you experience mania and depression within different parts of the day?"
bipolar,f0lplfj,t1_f0kxxgg,1568726172.0,So much truth. Thank you.
BipolarReddit,f0lpi6x,t1_f0ku52w,1568726099.0,Thank you so much!
bipolar,f02zq2a,t3_d3hw3f,1568341453.0,Definitely talk to your psychiatrist. But I'm feeling like it's more of a management of my volatile lifestyle. Consider a med addiction. I'm on Zyprexa which is more to stabilize my symptoms and lamictal to begin weaning off of the Zyprexa
bipolar,ezf9azs,t3_d0wwm3,1567874672.0,Look up DBSA. online support group that's great!
bipolar,ez00lzf,t3_czlj0g,1567628056.0,How'd you stay so focused that you could complete it?
bipolar,eysda2x,t3_cyimhi,1567394370.0,Finding the right doctor is just as important as finding the right meds. Mood stabilizers for me have worked pretty immediately.
bipolar,eyrpdkn,t3_cyfjrw,1567374654.0,Give yourself more credit. You still willingly chose her before marriage so why would it be out of the norm if you married her? Do your episodes last as long as your engagement? Don't give the disorder any credit
bipolar,eyrp1e3,t3_cyftky,1567374404.0,Lots of greens or a powder that has superfoods. Working out helps too. Unfortunately we have to go about things the old fashioned way because metabolic stimulants can increase mania.
bipolar,eyrnspb,t3_cyaiaa,1567373457.0,What is this? A sleep aid or mood stabilizer?
bipolar,eyiihok,t1_eyfcq4k,1567102905.0,I apologize so much but then feel bad that I feel bad and start the viscous cycle of negativity towards myself
bipolar,eyii7ns,t3_cwnted,1567102800.0,Anyone ever applied to jobs or just SOMETHING to get some sort of email or text notification??
bipolar,exvwrlr,t3_cum21a,1566608220.0,Go to https://www.supportgroupscentral.com/  there are many support groups so you can attend more frequently when you need an outlet with therapy. I love going to these groups bc it's people who understand what I'm going through and can give me advice on how to cope.
bipolar,exf7bnx,t1_exf5u13,1566234307.0,It's so exhausting! Especially when you've looked at pretty much everything at least twice but just want something new.
bipolar,exekvsx,t1_exefqpb,1566218637.0,That too. I have to take notes but even if I do that sometimes I lose track
bipolar,exe1kp2,t1_exdyht8,1566194336.0,I have to constantly apologize bc the brain fog makes it seem like I'm not actively listening
bipolar,exe1h9h,t1_exdtpfp,1566194224.0,Yep!! And Zyprexa. It's just evil!!
bipolar,ex9rt22,t1_ex9r06k,1566093428.0,It's more of a facilitator led group. Participants can  express their thoughts and issues and othera with the disorder offer their support in expressing their experiences too. Go here to find out more. https://www.supportgroupscentral.com/groups_detail.cfm?cid=18
bipolar,ex9qnx1,t3_crux0i,1566092940.0,It's a constant reminder of the disorder. The feeling used to be that I was constantly annoyed that I even HAD to take meds bc of the disorder. Now I just accept that I have the disorder and in order to maintain my stability and life I have with less chaos I have to take the meds. Gotta give to get.
bipolar,ex85imw,t3_crqbgy,1566069024.0,"Zyprexa weight gain is due to the increase of cravings and the slow down of your metabolism so you store more calories. Start a regular workout routine NOW to help burn calories, keep up your metabolism, and help increase serotonin. Also write down what you're eating. This way you can see how much you're eating and you'll be more willing to slow down."
bipolar,ex2k9vg,t1_ex2jrwe,1565970900.0,Thank you!
bipolar,ex27uef,t1_ex1ik1q,1565964409.0,Thank you! I'm just hoping this next jump is something I can keep for longer than 2 years
bipolar,ex0vqqy,t1_ex0uz1s,1565923411.0,"I appreciate your transparency. I am gonna try the cross training in different parts of the department taking on different projects til I get a formal, long term career job"
bipolar,ex0bmpt,t1_ex0bfmu,1565909070.0,That's awesome! Ugh jelly and wishing I knew what I could do to feel more engaged
bipolar,ex0aprx,t1_ewyrca5,1565908494.0,I have a screening interview tomorrow that I might just blow it bc then I think of the anxieties of starting a new job.
bipolar,ex036ne,t1_ewzosz3,1565904295.0,Stay strong!
bipolar,ewzkf15,t1_ewzig49,1565896986.0,Yes! Or if in the office where I can work from home regularly. I do that at my job and it helps immensely bc when I start feeling antsy I can get away in the comfort of my own home.
bipolar,ewyyk9j,t1_ewyx2jl,1565888693.0,Right?!!! I mean I can keep a job but man...I just get an itch. Someone needs to come up with best jobs for bipolar peeps
bipolar,ewytsm7,t1_ewyrca5,1565886679.0,It's so hard! I tell myself that I'm not doing a job that I enjoy but  now I'm like well then what DO I like to do. Ugh so hard. I change jobs every 2 years and just want something shiny and new
bipolar,ewyq8l2,t1_ewyov5s,1565885177.0,What kept you going for that long?? I have a 2 year itch. I'm fighting against taking leave.
bipolar,ewydr6r,t3_cqmtoo,1565879318.0,Ahhhh so me!!
