BPD,fr0wg66,t3_glts1h,1589808330.0,I agree. I hate to sound like a bitch but I think more than half the people on this sub probably haven’t had a diagnosis :/
adderall,fqlrf8t,t1_fqlg7tf,1589464636.0,Thank u so much!
adderall,fqlre3y,t1_fqlhs9l,1589464618.0,Thanks so much this makes me feel better :)
BPD,fqlez7w,t1_fqkrux5,1589456177.0,I think for most people this is the case but I think people can also get personality disorders inherently because their parents have them
BPD,fql7izu,t1_fqc8b1o,1589448999.0,Thank you for your kind words sorry to hear you struggle with this too. Keep going I believe in you 💗
BPD,fqatytx,t1_fqapczd,1589225242.0,"Yeah absolutely! I loved Todd so much he was one of my fave characters. Yes I agree I don’t think they could’ve done much more with it, it was a perfect ending. Just a lil sad I’m never gonna see the characters again :( I’m hoping they might make a movie in a few years"
BPD,fqatlu3,t3_ghr3vf,1589225065.0,I think we are more likely to be into things like this due to abuse we have suffered in the past. Some people get certain “kinks” or w/e because they can be a coping mechanism. I’m not saying it’s a healthy way of coping though. But I can relate to you
BPD,fqahxxs,t1_fqah73h,1589219371.0,"Np :) imo, I think you should definately speak to him. Explain to him how it made you feel, & tell him you don’t feel that it’s fair since you always make an effort for him. It’s much better to talk about it than to bottle things up. Hopefully he will apologise, understand & make more of an effort in future. 

It’s seems that by saying he isn’t a person that likes holidays very much is just an excuse to not do anything. I have been with people like this before. I’m not a holiday person either due to trauma around holiday times, but I would still go out of my way to make my partner happy on that day. Especially if it was something like Mother’s Day. 

Happy Mother’s Day btw <3"
BPD,fqadiqv,t1_fqab9am,1589217227.0,"Yeah. One of my favourite shows ever. It helped me through so much theought the years. It’s so weird to see it finally end :( what Diane said at the end rlly hit close to home. But I’m happy that all the characters got a happy ending, even Bojack :)"
BPD,fqad1u2,t1_fqa6s90,1589216996.0,But he is her husband she should be able to rely on him. I think the way he treated her is not right. He should’ve made more effort.
BPD,fq8gi9l,t3_ghbhag,1589165669.0,Ah I loved that show. Taught me a lot of lessons. Yes I find that people love to put all the blame on us for things in friendships going wrong. I have a friend who basically blamed me for everything wrong in his life because I’m easy to use as a scapegoat. However he had been equally as toxic. Other people don’t like to admit where they have done wrong. Yet they say we can’t admit 🤷🏼‍♀️
BPD,fq88xdm,t3_gh79s5,1589160893.0,Oh yes. All the time.
BPD,fq85cdq,t1_fq7m5sq,1589158815.0,But you did say in the post it’s easier for women to be accepted & I took that to heart & im sorry. You literally mentioned that in the post tho. I’m sorry if you decided to delete the post because of me but that’s what I was responding to
BPD,fq7ijpa,t1_fq7d702,1589146840.0,Yes I know what you are saying but your post made it out as if women with bpd are just magically accepted when we are not. Sorry if I came across as hostile but when women show emotions no one takes us seriously because women are seen as overly emotional in general. I think a reason there is less representation of BPD in men is because significantly less men have it then women
BPD,fq7f7gw,t1_fq7bvc9,1589145602.0,Thank you so much 💗 yes that’s exactly how I am like. Using drugs as a way to escape my problems & mask what is going on. It’s hard not beating myself up about it especially when other people make me feel bad about it. Thank you again. Stay strong. We can do this together 💗💪
BPD,fq7boni,t3_ggzp77,1589144313.0,Lol it’s because BPD is more common in women. Women are more likely to be abused. Men are more likely to become violent. But no. The world is soooo hard for men right. It’s not just men with BPD who are victimised. We ALL are.
BPD,fq78ww0,t3_gh916a,1589143299.0,Yes I have suffered from an eating disorder since I was very young. I know how you feel it’s like having bpd doesn’t allow me to do anything in moderation even if it is a healthy thing I just get obsessed
stopdrinking,fpvgj7b,t1_fpvf7wy,1588944277.0,Yeah that’s just it isn’t it we can’t do it because we’re just not good at it or wired to be able to handle it like normal people can :(
stopdrinking,fpvgf67,t1_fpvg38h,1588944206.0,Yeah I totally agree. It’s just a waste of time & bad for our health
stopdrinking,fpvgbj3,t1_fpvg88w,1588944141.0,Yes that is exactly how I feel
stopdrinking,fpvfn5i,t1_fpvendk,1588943710.0,So true. I literally do no understand the mindset of other people & how they can treat it so casually like it’s not a problem. Or how they are happy to just get a bit tipsy & not blackout drunk which is what I do every time I start drinking.
stopdrinking,fpvffp3,t1_fpvesgn,1588943576.0,"Wow this explains a lot to me. I thought I was just the odd one out for not being able to drink in moderation, but you are right it is literally torture & impossible to do. & I’ve never understood how for other people it’s literally no problem. I think I rlly need to quit drinking for good & stop being in denial with myself. Thanks for sharing insight. 

Iwndwyt <3"
stopdrinking,fpvet95,t1_fpveazc,1588943166.0,I honestly think it is the same for me to. But I’ve been in denial for a long time. Telling myself I can cope with just the occasional drink but most of the time I can’t ... congrats on 9 months <3
stopdrinking,fpvenf2,t1_fpve5o0,1588943058.0,"Yes exactly this. I’ve never thought of it that way before, but it is just so much less hard work to just never drink again. The unpredictableness of just having one drink , like how I’m gonna deal with it the following days / weeks, the anxiety that comes with it is just not worth it. It just hard when majority of my friends / family are heavy drinkers. It feels lonely to not get drunk with them & watch them get drunk, but it’s even lonelier that path I will follow after risking drinking with them. I’ve never heard that quote before. I will remember that. Thank you for sharing , congrats on 1 year sober, that’s amazing 💗💗"
stopdrinking,fpve5k5,t1_fpve3v5,1588942726.0,This is exactly how I feel to. Thanks for sharing
BPD,fpv1wi3,t3_gfoeay,1588931892.0,Yes. I do this so much but especially if I’m drunk. Then I wake up the next morning full of regret. I don’t kno why I do it to myself but I wish I could stop
BPD,fpuktce,t3_gfmodm,1588915558.0,Being the oldest i think my mum & stepdad used me as a scapegoat a lot & blamed everything on me. But when this did things wrong they would literally never get in trouble.
BPD,foysp71,t1_foyaadq,1588178459.0,Thank you so much 💗💗good luck with moving. I hope to do that someday :) can me & my cats come with you hahaha 😂💕
BPD,foyrr3t,t3_ga8wg7,1588177964.0,I know how you feel. I feel lost without an FP lol like why do I always feel the need to get attached to one person 😭
SuicideWatch,foy9p9w,t1_foximre,1588168401.0,I’m so sorry you feel the same <3 we can get through this <3
BPD,foy9kw3,t3_ga4ycb,1588168330.0,I just want a fresh start :( I would love to move to a new country where no one knows me & start everything again
BPD,foy9dy5,t3_ga2mre,1588168213.0,Ugh yeah. I think about this all the time. It’s a defensive mechanism that we’ve taught ourselves but in the end it does the complete opposite :((((
BPD,fo7wp5j,t1_fo7nrt1,1587585837.0,"For me , I ended up over exercising & starving myself to make the pain easier & it developed into a full blown eating disorder & it was a distraction to me. For some people just “eating better “ etc just don’t work , and if ur like me some people take it too far until it actually becomes a danger to their health :/ I hate it when people act like that’s all it takes. Instead they should be encouraging ppl to receive therapy etc"
BPD,fo7us8g,t3_g61u5j,1587584904.0,Kind the opposite for me lol. I feel completely lost & broken if I don’t have someone to get attached to like that
BPD,fo5ot8v,t3_g5s1la,1587531202.0,I have a hard time recognising toxic relationships 😔
BPD,fo5n2vs,t3_g5u1en,1587529837.0,I obsess over not just exes but friends as well. I can’t move on from anyone ...
BPD,fo5my74,t1_fo5mdci,1587529735.0,"I think sensory overload being the main one, I have bpd & I experience that so much. lack of social awweness etc .. esp if you are not a “quiet borderline” like I would definitely say I am not a quiet borderline & am not high functioning as others with bpd. I think they can definitely be compared & I think it is absolutely likely that people with Asperger / autism are being misdiagnosed as being bpd."
BPD,fo5mb2o,t3_g5s35d,1587529235.0,Yes I think there are definately *a lot* of similarities

BPD,fo4tgla,t3_g5fope,1587510880.0,I don’t ever want kids anyway but a main reason now I wouldn’t wanna have them is because I hear bpd is inherited & not only that I wouldn’t want them growing up with an unstable fuck like me 🤷🏼‍♀️ which would prbably make them get it anyway lmao
BPD,fo4t9kc,t3_g5f6ff,1587510770.0,Sometimes I do not accept it & burst into anger ... or sometimes I just ignore it & make nothing of it. There is literally no ibwtween 😂😂

BPD,fn2v5v7,t1_fn2fkjh,1586604546.0,"Oh my god that is absolutely vile!! I hate that they say it so casually too! 🤢 I hope you blocked that guy. It’s so common now for boys to be like this. 


My friend was like that too. He also lied about being bisexual & used to “act camp” around girls on a night out so they would be more likely to like him & their boyfriends wouldn’t mind him getting touchy feely with them, or he would accuse them of homophobia. He literally told me all this casually as if it was okay ... Strange individual. Glad we don’t talk anymore. if you’re reading this please get therapy. 


I suspect he was a porn addict so his mind was very warped. I think that’s the case with a lot of boys nowadays."
BPD,fn144v5,t3_fyk5zk,1586554419.0,"Yeah. I used to be friends with a guy who used to fetishise girls who have “daddy issues” & he said they are more likely to be kinky, & those were the type of girls he tried hitting on. Gross. 

He doesn’t talk to me anymore, & I’m starting to realise now that it’s a good thing he’s not in my life anymore."
worldnews,fmyyeaf,t1_fmxgzc1,1586499739.0,Yep. Wanted to sell the NHS but ended up having to rely on it. Oh the irony.
Advice,fmysmvk,t1_fmyskgy,1586494551.0,"Yeah I might do, your advice has been rlly good though :) thanks so much take care"
Advice,fmys2jb,t1_fmyrm9k,1586494082.0,Thanks so much for your understanding. I know I desperately need to get rid of him. But I don’t know how. He’s using blackmail against me. I’ve told him things in the past that I rlly shouldn’t have & he’s threatening to use that against me. There definately isn’t a romantic component there. First time I met him he tried it on with me loads of times but I told him no & he’s persisted ever since. I stupidly kissed him once when I was still using drugs I was in the house alone with him I was scared that if he didn’t he might get angry or hurt me. When I first met him he tried convincing me to take roofies with him (I never did but that kinda says it all). If I tell him to leave me alone I think he might try to ruin my life I wish I never met him to be honest.
BPD,fmyro4z,t3_fy1ajr,1586493752.0,Oh yes omg I was in sooooo much denial at first. Id always thought I had bipolar that’s what everone Iaround me though my gp & psychtrist though that so i though I was misdiagnosed. Took a long time to accept it. I still don’t think I’ve come to terms w it.
BPD,fmyrbs9,t3_fy5zk0,1586493472.0,That was really insensitive of him wow. Sounds kinda like negging to me. Is he like this with you often ?
BPD,fmyr755,t3_fy28jh,1586493366.0,I have a lot of the time too I tend to feel sorry for myself but I try to remind myself not to otherwise I won’t achieve anything but then an event happens & i just forget all of that & im back at square one 😭
BPD,fmyr1va,t3_fy0pgc,1586493248.0,Yeah. And most of the time I make the worst first impressions hahahaha
Advice,fmypuv7,t1_fmypprl,1586492305.0,Thank you. Yeah I would ask my stepdad but I don’t trust him. He’s thrown my possessions away before & he’s given them away to his current girlfriend & lied to me about it. I wouldn’t be surprised if he threw them away just to spite me.
Advice,fmyprl7,t1_fmypnco,1586492234.0,Thank you so much. I will remebwr this💗 I’m sorry to hear about your blanket too
BPD,fmypnqv,t1_fmwdynr,1586492153.0,Thanks for this. :) yeah you are right xx we are making progress. I sometimes struggle with setting boundaries with people but I’m getting better ! ☺️ take care.
BPD,fmwdkzo,t1_fmwd3yv,1586444635.0,Absolutely! The only downside about being diagnosed is the stigma around BPD when we tell people we have it they demonise us or whenever we feel negative emotions even if they are valid they just put it down to our bpd which is so frustrating & it’s also rlly frustrating that professionals don’t know much about this illness either. That’s why I tend to keep it to myself now I don’t tell many people :( when they ask I just say I have depression
BPD,fmw5n52,t3_fxf2il,1586440067.0,YeahKnowing that it’s there & is an option is rlly helpful for me
BPD,fmw5g8h,t3_fxm4t2,1586439946.0,I definately am no where near recovered but I am a lot better than I was & I would say yhqt recieving my diagnosis helped me a lot. Before I didn’t understand my emotions or where they came from everyone thought I was bipolar lol even my psychiatrist thought that was all it was. But now I kinda understand myself better I feel more in control.
SuicideWatch,fmw53ao,t1_fmp0jit,1586439718.0,"Thank you so much xx I’m so sorry you’ve been through something similar. Yes, I have one person in my life who I tell everything to & I have a few good friends. I’m feeling a lot calmer today, but yeah sometimes it rlly does feel impossible :("

BPD,fmk424y,t1_fmk3hi6,1586144034.0,"Ohhh i see I didn’t realise they were used to just treat adhd. I have never been diagnosed with adhd so I don’t think snri would be prescribed to me. 

But yeah I agree with you ! I desperately want therapy but my gp & mental health time have said I can’t go back to therapy / concelling until I have completed my drug / alcohol councelling. Which I have done. But they still won’t let me have therapy. I deseperatly need it. I’ve cut down my drinking so much & I’ve pretty much stopped taking drugs. The drug & alcohl coucellint is okay but desperately need 1 on 1 therapy lol it’s so frustrating mental health care is so shitty."

I’m glad to hear that antipsychotics worked out for you. they are definately not for everyone , Altho I have only tried the one , chlorpromazine. But yeah my paranoia is exactly the same as how you get it. I also get paranoid about catching diseases & stuff to the point it’s actually ruining my life. Maybe I should try a different antipsychotic. I’m glad you’ve finally found something that works for you & thank you for sharing your experience <3"

I’ve always self harmed I don’t think taking Zoloft made it any worse but deffo didn’t make it any better. I went a long time without doin it once but have recently started doin it again. Yeah I was on a medication used to treat schizophrenia , chlorpromazine, which is an antipsychotic. It helped with my anger a little & the paranoid thoughts & symptoms of psychosis I get but honestly the side effects just were not worth it for me :(  good luck to you & yo ur husband <3"
BPD,fmjusbi,t3_fviwwe,1586138181.0,This is me tbh. We love other people so intensely but I think it’s because we get so attached to people.
