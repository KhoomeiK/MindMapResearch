biglittlelies,fqwd88m,t3_gl7c45,1589700300.0,"There‚Äôs actually a common part to the cycle of abuse where the victim begins to subconsciously notice a pattern. Get hit, big apology, promise to be better, honeymoon phase, something sets them off again, get hit ‚Äî then cycle begins again. When a victim can tell the honeymoon phase has warn off, sometimes they will purposely escalate things so that they can get the beating over with, and jumpstart the cycle to get to the honeymoon phase again. That‚Äôs why it can seem confusing when a victim acts in a way that they KNOW will make their partner violent. It‚Äôs because they just want everything to be ok again & this is the only control they have over the situation."

In the middle of the night last night I woke up and my down-there bits were a bit uncomfortable with a slight sting of pain. Usually this happens when my underwear is too tight or I‚Äôm sleeping in a position that doesn‚Äôt let it breathe. It goes away if I remove the restricting clothes and just wait a bit. Of course I was convinced that I have a long-standing hidden UTI that I haven‚Äôt noticed and have probably let progress to KIDNEY FAILURE and yep my kidneys are gonna fail toDAY and since the hospitals are overwhelmed no one can help me.

AskRedditAfterDark,fmwoohv,t1_fmwjxrz,1586450322.0,"This! Kind of embarrassing but I used to struggle a lot with UTI‚Äôs/Yeast infections in the beginning of my boyfriend and I‚Äôs relationship. I was young and didn‚Äôt know to pee after sex, or shower if you‚Äôre having sex multiple times, etc. 

He would gently ask me (not during sexy time, which is important so emotions don‚Äôt run too high) if I‚Äôm feeling ok down there. He said he is very used to how I smell and taste and feel, and loves it but has noticed a difference in odor and taste lately. This was a sweet way of showing he cares & instead of saying he doesn‚Äôt like how I smell, he says there‚Äôs a DIFFERENCE and to maybe look into it. 

Good luck!"

TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fmgyz8x,t3_futj2z,1586061702.0,"I also just joined tiktok and oh god all of my inferiority complexes are coming back to me...I thought I was over thinking slim thick white girls are all anyone thinks is attractive but here I am again. 

I try to remember that there is nothing particularly special about having a naturally ‚Äúconventionally attractive‚Äù face/figure. These people are just born with it and it has nothing to do with how they are as a person. They are not better because they look different (granted, people seem to treat people they think are attractive better, but that‚Äôs on them!). 

Also ‚Äî different time periods have different beauty standards! Slim thicc was not always popular‚Äîit‚Äôs just having its moment right now. Who knows, maybe whatever your vibe is will be popular a decade from now and everyone will be jealous that you have it going for you naturally! 

Lastly‚Äîit‚Äôs good to keep in mind that beauty is subjective. Of course there are general molds that are popular right now no matter what, BUT in my opinion it‚Äôs all about individual ~sex appeal~. Everyone has a different vibe. No matter how you look, you have the ability to express yourself ANY way you want to! People who are into what you‚Äôre putting out there will think you‚Äôre lovely because they like you! Hone in on whatever makes you YOU and own it! 

Brb, gonna try to take my own advice..."

AskRedditAfterDark,fi1pckp,t1_fi1nagg,1582062164.0,"I think it‚Äôs amazing that they had such a good intuition that they were in the right here. I remember when I first told my dad I was moving in with my boyfriend. He was SO mad and couldn‚Äôt understand, but in my heart I knew it was the right decision and asked him to please just be patient and he will see. We have been living together for 3 1/2 years now, 3 different places together and it has gone great. However, moving in felt like it was the natural next step for our relationship; we were already staying at each other‚Äôs houses all of the time, felt mature enough to handle sharing finances, etc. When I get asked why we aren‚Äôt married already I just don‚Äôt see why we would....it wouldn‚Äôt really change much for us? We would still live together. Not sure why it‚Äôs necessary to make the commitment at a certain time if you‚Äôre already confident you‚Äôre going to be together forever.
