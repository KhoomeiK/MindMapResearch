It takes years of knowledge and experience to do that. Hacking is a artform because you have to be creative in your method. As soon as it's discovered, it's patched. You move on to your next idea and so on.

I agree, I think in the end, it came down to the fact that we just had very different core ethics and morals in what is acceptable and what isn't. Only that it took 8 months and a broken heart to discover that. She however never saw a problem with it.

She was never flirtatious with other guys, well obviously not in front of me lol, but I know for a fact she has tendencies to flirt, even if she doesn't mean to do it, it still comes across that way. I know, because I was that guy once. 

She told me of multiple times in the past of getting hit on, felt up, and even sexually assaulted on a couple occasions. I'm sorry, but no matter how much you try and convince me (which she tried to) that none of it was her fault, I could smell the bullshit *straight away*. What you put out is what you eventually get back, and that goes with anything in life. It doesn't change with relationships. That really pissed me off when she got all defensive about telling me all these stories, and then me questioning her about it...babe do you think it was the way you were dressing at the time, the way you conducted yourself, the people you were hanging around?? Then...she literally blasted me as in how f\*\*king I dare I question her. That was probably one of the biggest red flags and pretty much answered alot of other questions for me.

I know it's normal human behavior and great for self esteem to still feel wanted and attracted by other people. We all want to feel and look beautiful.

Of course it still comes down to who runs it, how much time they put into it etc. Obviously if he is willing to show you, he must be proud of his work. Ask first if you are allowed to take some photos (some businesses are not allowed to for privacy and security reasons).

Things that will look cool and be of interest to take away are:

1. Cabinet layouts
2. Cable management
3. Asking how and where it all runs from (i.e. Start at the router and ask him where it leads to the core switch, switch stacks, servers etc)
4. See if you can get a look at the network documentation (there are some interesting things that he will surely miss, that will be in an 'as-built documentation')
5. Ask to look at the network monitoring software (which I assume he should have setup) i.e. PRTG, Spiceworks, Solarwinds etc. This will help you greatly understand the span of the network and will allow him to explain it easier with a visual representation.

It definitely sounds like you need a second set of hands to help you clear out your tickets. It seems you are caught in the middle of support, engineering and management aspects of the IT for your business.

Your CEO would have met with the CFO and/or COO and just talked figures. That's all CFO and COO look at. CEO's always get pushbacks because of budgets. Even though they ultimately control the business, they are just the head figure and sign all the papers.  That's how you got your support company for 18/hr a week again.

She must have smoked way too much cat fur last night."
Drugs,f6hsxhi,t1_f6hrwp0,1572864374.0,"I haven't done edibles so I can't speak on it. 

Pills cause addiction? Hell yeh they can, even if you don't successfully catch yourself an addiction, you will become dependent to the point where you will need them to function. 

So now you're taking them for the purpose of feeling normal, not to enhance yourself or studying capabilities. That's the crossover between recreational/medicinal usage, and fiending for something. 

Don't think it won't happen because it can and will. I'm living proof."
Drugs,f6hrn84,t1_f6hk1kw,1572863484.0,"Yeh don't get started on pills. Even though no one will know about it, I think that's half the problem. You know you cant get caught and its legal (for the most part). Any benzos or stimulants can spiral out of control on you real quick, and then you have another problem, addiction. 
I was still living at my parents and yeh, the smell or them catching me red eyed, was enough to make me paranoid to only do it after they had gone to sleep.

Buy some incense, and if you get questioned say it relaxes you. It's also a great mask for weed."
Drugs,f6hj4zf,t1_f6hivgb,1572850767.0,I was more smoking after I had studied to relax and reflect. Then I would think about certain questions and Google my way through it and come along some other cool stuff along the way.

All I'm saying is that I hope I don't get black out drunk and commit homosexual acts, sucking cock, handjobs etc etc. I am not gay but have lots of gay guys hit on me, even straight guys said if they were gay they'd hit on me..."
Drugs,f6hhtl4,t3_drdiqt,1572849021.0,"I wouldn't say there's any drugs to improve your grades, rather drugs that will put you in the mood to study. Also what you are studying as well. I was smoking weed studying IT and I aced it. That's not to say it will work for everyone, but it just helped me with better logical thinking. 

It did make me lazy though and hard to get out of bed in the morning."

cybersecurity,f6hdwyf,t3_dra00q,1572844449.0,"This must be the hospital that closes up open heart surgeries with band-aids.

Ive seen schools like this, but a hospital? Surely there has to be some way to patch critical systems into a different production subnet, different physical location, while this mess gets cleaned up? I'm curious to know what country this is in. If it was Australia, this would spark a Royal Commission investigation.

I understand it would be tough to manage and engineer a network like this, but you don't take on the role if you can't handle it. This has either been let go by a burnt out sys admin, or just pure laziness."

I just cant stand when people judge from afar and without knowing the circumstances or reasoning why I did it."

FantasyPL,f6gxovs,t1_f6gwlct,1572832492.0,"Yeh I totally agree regarding conceding goals. There was 2 reasons I put 3 at the back with Leicester - 

1. No one in my important league (work league) had anything similar and we all have pretty identical teams, I was slipping and needed the opportunity to gain extra points somehow. 
2. Leicester had these 2 GW's easy and yes, now I will start getting rid of them. That was the whole point of this. Evans will go first this week for Vardy and then Soyuncu, but I might still keep Pereira for the next few weeks.

I'm happy for you at 81k. My competition isnt against the overall, its against these fuckers that I work with :)"
