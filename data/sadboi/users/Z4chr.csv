Only thing I could do was double up on my Seroquel and hope for the best. Seemed to have worked!"

It usually involves having at least 5 different projects or ideas going at a time. This makes it super easy to jump around everywhere working or different things or shopping for that perfect item. Plus, friends and relatives don’t think I’m crazy."

Send them articles, documentaries....anything that you feel will help them learn. Following my diagnosis but before treatment, my fiancé and I fought constantly but it never occurred to me he didn’t take the time to understand my disorder. Once we scrolled through articles together, read books, watched movies with bipolar characters, he was able to understand my condition and it’s severity!

It took my psychiatrist 6 months to find a happy place for my meds. I’m currently on 1200mg of lithium carbonate and 50mg of Seroquel. Side effects are brutal which is why they slowly increase your dosage but you’ll adjust! I’m a young guy in his 20s and the biggest side effect for me is feeling aches and tired at 7:30pm. I consider it my bodies internal bedtime timer. I have yet to see a therapist but have finally reached a stable point where I want to talk about my condition.

One of the best things I’ve found that helps me stay stable is a set routine (to the minute....), with something fun and spontaneous at least one a month like date night, hike, pottery class, etc."
BipolarReddit,fk6r2qc,t3_fgf3ec,1583912420.0,Go see your GP or one in network with the earliest appointment date! Not only can they prescribe you medication (usually a one time thing if you have an existing diagnosis....) but will also be able to provide you with a therapist and psychiatrist to see. When I started treatment a while ago I was able to get a same day appointment with my current psychiatrist.
