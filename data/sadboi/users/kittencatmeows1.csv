I see that you reference having subs with a strict expectation and I also see how you've relaxed your expectations and punishments to fit his needs. That's commendable! I think perhaps you would benefit from investigating a daddy/mommy Dom dynamic. While it doesn't mean you have to suddenly make that your ""kink"" I see allot of advice on some of those subreddits that I think would help you create a good structure for him in a way that is more gentle. 

How long have you been living together? Vs how long has he had a job? It could just be that he is learning still! 

I know you said you are moving away from punishments and while I see why your doing it I think he might benefit from ""consequences"". This could be something like maybe having him make copies of his notes by hand if he fails a task?
