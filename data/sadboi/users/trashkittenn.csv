they have a work permit and ssn, although they still don't have a green card and from what I know if they commit a crime they'll be deported. obviously these small thefts and stuff doesn't really count, so I need a way to aggravate then so they attack me. it shouldn't be hard. they've already messed up my door, it has a hole from hitting it and I had to replace the screws on the door thing because it just wouldn't close. it also broke a lock. they scream a bit but lately we have been ignoring each other. so reddit, how do I get provoke them? 

I should mention the girl is a clean freak and her husband is so germaphobic he wants me to use a different sink other than the kitchen one to wash cat food bowls. I can't even put them in the dishwasher. he's got a business and I've rated it down on all my google accounts and I've been asking all my friends to do the same. I'm sorry this post is unorganized, I have a headache. another thing he did, he used the basement and opened it and my cat went in and he locked him in there. I noticed my cat being gone at night so I assumed my mom took him in her room. searched the entire house except for the basement because I'd thought nobody opened it. 13 hours after he got locked in I thought about checking and there was my little crying baby. then they started closing the laundry room door because they expect me to clean it when they never do. I kept opening it and they kept closing it, so I said if you keep doing it I'll lock your cat in the basement. you know what this asshole said? if you do that I'll lock you in the basement. please help guys"

depression,f4idd2b,t3_dkkejd,1571602611.0,"I think the closest you can get to how you want to feel would be to find something that makes you want to exist for it. look, I know it sounds like a cliche, and I know how much people hate people telling others to just feel better, but there is no purpose to life until you make one yourself. 

for me specifically, I'm a psychopath that desperately doesn't want to be an abuser, so instead of hurting people I project it all into love for one person. which understandably causes obsession. but after giving up on my search for the perfect partner, I happened to run into my perfect partner. 

now I'm engaged and so so happy. I have lots of problems, and we are apart due to the army, and I have depressive and manic episodes when I'm not with him, but when it's over, we'll be together, and whenever we are I genuinely want to live. for now I just have to wait and hang in there.

so like I said, the only thing you could really do is find a purpose."

in terms of reaching out, I'm in the dark. I'm alone in the dark right now. I guess I have reached out? I don't know

in the way of psychotherapy, they don't help all that much to feel better, but it does make me understand myself better. friends usually don't know what you're dealing with, and usually don't have any clue on how to help. every story I've read about someone defeating depression, they did it with the help of their SO. ive almost been there, before my fiance left, but everything else wasn't better. now everything else is still as bad, but my fiance isn't here. in a few years, if I make it that long, once he's done serving, I don't think I'll be depressed. I'll be leaving behind everyone and everything that contributes to me getting worse, and I'll be taking only what makes me happy. 

but that's years from now.

take it a minute, or an hour at a time

live in the now now

don't worry too much about the future, try to make yourself happy right now.

I had a therapist like that once, it's why my problems got as bad as they did. but eventually I decided that what I have (diagnosed severe depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, seperation anxiety, anorexia, pyromania, psychopathy, insomnia) got really out of hand. 

when people pressure me/don't listen to me when it counts, I can't speak what I need to say and I start crying, and eventually a panic attack. when I see anything or am in a situation where my ptsd will act up (being too close to an old guy, family touching me physically, electric fires, smells of anything that might be burnt INDOORS, fires also indoors, outdoor stuff doesn't set me off because pyromania, any mention of a sick pet and anything worse, those rescued animal videos too) I'll have an inevitable panic attack and honestly I still don't know how to quite make them go away. I usually just call whoever will pick up and ask them to tell me about something they're passionate about. like this one time I called my friend n he decided to tell me the entire cod storyline. it worked though, it seems I need to focus on something but not everything works. 

whenever I go to see my psychiatrist, who's also my therapist, and he asks me questions pertaining to when the depression started (11 yo for me, I'm 19 now) I'll still have hysterical fits of crying. people in my life (not my friends or so, more like roommates and figures of authority) don't understand why I can't do a lot of things, and they pressure me to do them, and I just break down every time. yet they keep doing it. 

my depression makes it so that I have episodes of dying mentally and sometimes I'll wake up and have a panic attack because I'm worrying about life and how I can keep going and try to chill out and then smoke some weed. I have a hard time getting up, I'm chronically exhausted, I forget things, I can't explain this to said people, we have a bit of a language barrier (we all speak Russian, I speak English too, they don't, but I don't know how to translate my mental problems to them to be able to tell them what is wrong, and what they need to stop and why. indirectly you've given me an idea, I'm gonna google translate stuff and just overall write a nice letter in Russian and print it for them, problem is they might not believe it, despite me being diagnosed, they don't really believe in mental problems). 

so I'm a big extrovert, and to try and feel better I do things with people and go outside. it takes a lot of work, but I do try, and sometimes I don't have any time left over for anything. I'll wake up late, get ready, arrive late, and by the time I'm home (commutes for me are an hour plus usually since everything is far, it's nyc tho so not quite far?) I have no energy for anything. I will undress, lay down, still struggle to fall asleep, have to spend an hour just to get up to pee before I sleep because it's so draining.

I have a fiance, I am suicidal, but I know that if I kill myself there's not going to be anyone that'll take good care of my cats. good God the cats. they're very attached to only me and my fiance, mostly me since I've raised them, and they don't like anyone else enough to come out when they get home. I also know that I'd be killing my fiance. he's been through a lot as well, and he loves me with the entirety of his heart. my heart hurts thinking about this, because he's in the army right now, and we got engaged 4 days before he left, and at the moment, the only way we can talk is via mail. I do send him lots of stuff, already sent 30 double sided pages, so 60 of just straight text. lots of pictures and some other cool stuff that would fit in a regular letter envelope. he forgot his phone in New York, and his mom refuses to give it to me now so I can't even look at most of the pictures I took of him, I'm really upset about that.

it's hard waiting, but I have no interest in anyone beyond him and my cats, so I guess I'm in that low % of military wives that don't cheat. I've already told you what problems I have, and you can see how some of them don't pair well with this. but he's my soulmate, I can see life without him, it's not worth living. every day is a struggle, and I've been putting off writing because of the limited energy. I'm so so tired. I'm tired or everything. I miss my love, I wish I could speak with him. I sent him a nice long letter about how I feel too, because it's important for him to know. he's the only person that willingly cares so much about me that nothing is too big a deal, everything will be fixed, and I feel the same way. 

to clear something up, he's had a few contracts by now and he signed the last right before he met me, and we very quickly got together, but by the time it was time to void they didn't let him, so he had to go anyway. he didn't want to, neither did I. he's not doing too well either, but I think he's stronger than me mentally. he has separation anxiety also. 

I currently take antidepressants and antipsychotics, though my antidepressants are still in the process of being dosed right, I'm currently on like 10 mg? of Lexapro, and it doesn't seem to help much yet. maybe I've been a little less tired, I can't tell anymore when it's always what you feel. my next appointment is like Friday I think, so I'll get a better one. I don't think I'll ever truly get over all of these things, I think I'll have to live with majority for the rest of my life, but it's okay because I don't plan on living too long and I'm super accident prone so I guess we'll see. 

sorry for long post, it's not so much me venting as it is describing I don't even know what, I'm not mentally organised enough to type something good.

I was seeing my man off for what we thought was the last time, he gave me a cactus, I forgot it in a train station bathroom. I returned after coming all the way home and realising after seeing it's my stop to get off the bus.
