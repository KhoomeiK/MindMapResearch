drugmemes,fr1xu7k,t1_fr1927q,1589827762.0,"They are different in a lot of ways, but as far as therapeutic use goes they're pretty similar. Desoxyn (methamphetamine HCl) is, while rarely prescribed, described as being similar to Adderall with less side effects and a much smoother ride (note that the therapeutic doses usually cap out at 20-25mg).

As far as recreational use goes, meth is an entirely different beast. But they aren't that different in terms of actual effects (there is some difference, particularly in duration and obviously strength), it's just that meth has a lot less side effects relative to dose, meaning that one can use a lot more of it when trying to get high. A lot of people I've talked to who've taken both have described them as being extremely similar at equivalent dosages, but mileage varies and I've also heard the opposite. I'd argue the biggest reason that desoxyn is so rarely prescribed is the stigma (and the higher abuse/addiction potential plays a part too), as it's very therapeutically effective from the limited anecdotal evidence I've seen (from being prescribed desoxyn, not taking street meth).

Anyway that was a huge ramble and I didn't back it with any primary sources, so take it with a grain of salt."

I don't think it's my best song, but it's my first attempt at using virtual instruments in my DAW, and it's a little disjointed and basic as a result. The only non-virtual instrument here is the piano, which I've been playing for about 6 months now (that's also when I started writing).

I definitely have room to improve, but I think it's a good start considering low experience with both Ableton and piano. I'm hoping to get a cord to use my keyboard as a MIDI controller soon.

ninja edit: I forgot to mention that a large chunk of the song was cut off because I'm a dumbass and didn't save the project file after exporting it, and I also fucked up the export. Not making that mistake again."

Because most of autism's symptoms are based on behavior, it's hard to tell that something is different until later on.

Granted, that wasn't your point. Your point was that the noticeable onset being delayed can lead to anti-vaxxers drawing conclusions, which I also believe to be true. The issue is they often refuse to educate themselves with primary sources and then say to ""do your research"" after watching a YouTube video.

I don't feel you using better words was entirely necessary, since it would be tedious to differentiate between all the different kinds of things you were describing at once (though I suppose there are better umbrella terms too - ailments is the one that comes to mind for me, but there are probably more). 

Autism and Down's Syndrome absolutely can limit what a person is capable of achieving, I don't think it's ableist or anything to say that. Lower-functioning people with both disorders are often incapable of living on there own. Higher functioning people with them are often much more capable, but it still brings many obstacles alongside it. I have high functioning autism (mostly speculation, but it's been speculated by doctors I've had and by my family/friends since early childhood) and am hoping to be able to get a Ph.D. later in my life. While I'm good at remembering numbers or remembering and reciting information, I'm also pretty bad at socializing (I've improved steadily over time, though) and am impaired when it comes to differentiating between information that is and isn't important. I also couldn't read until I was 7, tie my shoes until I was 9, or clip my nails on my own until I was about 10. It comes with positives and negatives, at least for me."

I agree with all of the points you made in your post, it was very well articulated and generally a similar train of thought to what I have (I'm not an anarchist, though I'm guessing anarchy probably doesn't mean full-on do whatever the fuck you want. I'm not educated enough on the principles of anarchism to really speak about it).

Can you elaborate on ""the lack of a concise set of values to be upheld""? That statement is a little vague, and I'd like to hear what your thoughts are on that. What I get from it is that America doesn't truly have any direction for stepping themselves forward, because they're always too sucked into meaningless political baffle with the two-party system polarizing half the country into different groups that despise each other. That's what I get from it, but I'm guessing it's not what you meant."

It's just the American education system at play, I've had to walk through it and I've seen kids who thought the fires in Australia were going to spread to other countries or couldn't even find America on the map. It's why I left high school, the standardized education here is a joke and it's ruining the youth. 

When you give someone an argument as properly articulated as yours, you're probably not going to get an equivalent or even coherent response. They're probably pretty dogmatic about loving America (it's fine to love your country, I don't even hate it here. I'd just like to see it improve, and there's a whole lot to improve on)."

I've had similar thoughts on the right of refusal. I still think anti-vaxxers are retarded and that you're retarded if you don't get vaccinated. I don't believe in mandatory vaccinations because I feel that it violates basic human rights. I'd prefer, though, that unvaccinated people don't go anywhere near me due to risk of catching both stupidity and whatever the fuck they're potentially spreading.

iamatotalpieceofshit,fotjm02,t1_fotieff,1588055944.0,"Yes, it's a very nuanced issue. Humans are very tribal by nature and I think it's miraculous that we live in a world where people are, in most places, able to intermingle without discrimination based on ethnicity (obviously people will still be racist, but it's probably impossible to have an entirely discrimination free world. Some people are too stupid for that). There are still issues to iron out, but the fact that we've gone from segregation in America to it being entirely normalized to have interracial friendships within 70 years or so is amazing to me. There are a lot of cool ass people I'd have never been able to be friends with if I were born during a time where segregation was the norm or I were born to parents that instilled racist values in me (I like to think that if I had racist parents in this day and age I'd be able to be smarter than them, but even if I overcame that I'd probably still have some deeply ingrained racism and accidentally be racist. That's where intent comes into play)."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fotez15,t1_fotdrzi,1588051990.0,"Abso-fuckin-lutely man. I always just try to think rationally in a way that makes sense to me, but I also try to understand where others are coming from and acknowledge that I could be wrong. Articulation is a skill and it took me a long time to start getting good at it (I suppose that also comes with age though, I'm only 17 after all. Things start to seem clearer and clearer after each year). The best way I learned to start thinking rationally was to always consider where somebody is coming from and to also acknowledge that I COULD be wrong, no matter how ludicrous the claim (okay, not always, but within fair reason. If somebody, for example, tells me one race is inferior I'm probably not gonna take into consideration anything they say. But typically if it's not something so glaringly different from what I consider to be correct I'll listen), and then to try to draw my conclusions. After I started doing this my entire view of the world started to change and I began to become, in my opinion, a much better and much more level-headed person. I'm not perfect, though. None of us are, and it's fine that you're not too. Getting downvoted by the Reddit hivemind shouldn't be the lowlight of your day, especially when you just got downvoted because you weren't articulating yourself in a way that made it entirely clear as to what you actually meant."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fot1pm9,t1_fosz95b,1588042693.0,"I agree with a lot of the points in that article, though it's arguing from a psychological standpoint rather than a philosophical one. Just because someone had good intentions doesn't mean their actions didn't have a negative impact. I don't think someone should get off scot-free because they had good intentions. The reason I believe that intention is still a major factor when determining something is because it leaves room for growth. If someone does or says something immoral when they intend it to be moral, there is an inherent behavioral difference there and the way it's handled should be somewhat different. I don't think that means that somebody is at all in the right or justified in their actions as a result.

In terms of psychological impact, the result may be the same. I don't disagree with that. The reason I believe intents still matter and need to be taken into consideration is almost purely because there is room for personal growth and an apology if somebody does something with good intentions. (Just a side note that I'm viewing this as a philosophical discussion between people with two different views, and I don't want to you to dislike me or vice-versa. I would like to be proven wrong.)

I'll use an example and use one that can hit close to home for me, just so that I can acknowledge the points in that article. I am mentally ill, but I'll use my ADHD as it's the easiest thing for someone to unintentionally be rude about. If I forget something and someone calls me out and says ""ADHD moment!"" without actually intending to be rude to me (even though it's insensitive), I'll forgive it if I can easily realize they're being rude unintentionally. It'll still have the same impact on me (hence the psychology vs philosophy thing I mentioned earlier. I'm human, and am prone to that psychological phenomena), but I can recognize that it wasn't meant with bad intent. That intent changes a whole lot in the context there, so I don't believe it's a nonfactor.

I think there should be a balance of impact and intent. People aren't perfect, and they'll fuck up. There are a lot of factors that go into how much intent matters, but I believe it should always play at least a small part in the final verdict (like I believe you said before, it's issue-dependent and impact matters a lot more for actions that have a major impact.)

Regardless, I have a better understanding of where you're coming from now and your train of thought makes a lot more sense to me than it did with your initial comments."
