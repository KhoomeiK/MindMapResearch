Basically he brought Linguistics back into Science Realism while integrating it into part of Biological Sciences. He's been very vocal about what is the nature of scientific inquiry and what constitutes scientific method that contributes to the advancement of  human knowledge. 

He ia also a vocal critic of AI as a scientific method that seeks to explain natural and behavioral phenomena through probability."
VietNam,exgsphh,t1_exf1moh,1566273622.0,"Actually I can say the rules on orientation (your term) is pretty lax. Like I said this is understandable given the cross-linguistic similarities between Chinese and Vietnamese. If you know Spanish, we know there can be two ways to order adjective (left or right to the head noun).  
Here I constrain my explanation for the phenomenon above to noun phrases formed from an adjective and a noun only. There is supposed to be a constraint on adjective-noun order in Vietnam. Subjective attributive adjectives (those that provides subjective description of the noun) only occur to the right of the noun.  
we can say '*nữ nhà báo*' or 'nhà báo nữ', but we cannot say 'già ông' instead of 'ông già'. The difference between adjective nữ and adjective già is that the latter gives a subjective description, while the former simply tells an objective - undeniable truth about the referent the noun denotes."

We have a bureau of labor safety within Dept of Labor that is in charge of administrating those regulations. I did some research and learned that in some sites coal mining workers are distributed with silicone masks and coal dust filters.
VietNam,ewx83df,t1_ewx6pj1,1565847954.0,"Thanks :)  


I belong to the younger generation you mentioned (20ish) with college degree not in Hán-Nôm, so I have very little grasp of the Hán-Nôm writing system (I group both for convenience but aware of the differences) because students my age have no formal compulsory education on the subject but I definitely hope to learn more, as I'm very curious, when I can balance with other priorities (haha this sounds like a typical youth mindset, constantly making excuses). Yet I believe it's curiosity that drives one to learn more about what is not in one's priorities, so probably another approach to help your kids become interested in the history of Vietnamese language might help?  


By the way, I've already posted my translation of the poem in r/RedditVN, I'm not sure if you have checked it out, but gladly hope you would."
VietNam,ewx75jv,t1_ewvythm,1565846896.0,"Very well dissected, though it might not be clear enough as what you meant by object-oriented.   


The grammar of Vietnamese and Chinese share quite many similarities and some differences, but probably the most pronounced difference can be seen in the structure of noun phrase (NP), specifically its head directionality.  
Chinese NP has its head noun (N) occur to the right of the phrase while it's the other way around for Vietnamese NP.  
Chinese NP --> modified element + N   
Eg: tây phong, as you mentioned, has phong as N and tây as modified element  
Vietnamese NP --> N + modified element  
Eg: gió tây has gió as N and tây as modified element  


Understandably there should be quite several exceptions to the Vietnamese rule above, due to the large proportion of Sino vocabulary

I can think of one now, *dân ý* in *trưng cầu dân ý '*public opinion' has its head *ý* occur to the right while technically we would expect *trưng cầu ý dân* to be generated from Vietnamese grammar. Interestingly nowadays people alternate between the two.

VietNam,ewsbqqf,t1_ewrroxm,1565724204.0,"I hope to get some facts straight.

  
The poem you posted in this thread is part of a novel titled *Jin Yun Qiang* written by a Chinese author under pseudonym Qingxin Cairen during the 16th century.

A Vietnamese poet named Nguyễn Du, I would say, based off of this novel to write an epic poem titled Đoạn Trường Tân Thanh, commonly known as Truyện Kiều, in more than 3000 verses (six-eight meter) and in chữ Nôm (basically Classical Chinese with some added naturalized characters for Vietnamese phonemes). This is the one I think you refer to as part of national literary treasure of Vietnam (and that's right \^\^).

I'd add that I would like my child to practice empathy towards other people since I believe it is, deep down, a basic human need - the need to feel empathetic to people's suffering and be shown empathy when they are in trouble. Since it is in our nature, imo, to have a tendency to sympathize and cooperate with others, we need to help our kids develop these virtues."

OP didn't specify the kid's age, so I can assume the kid might be making a transition from diaper, where he/she urinates involuntarily, to controlled urinating and the whole process isn't as simple as it might seem, especially in this case it's a boy, meaning it's not always easy to control the flow of urine. Praising a boy's effort for successfully doing the act is a kind of positive encouragement and I am sure with common sense it is fine to do so."
