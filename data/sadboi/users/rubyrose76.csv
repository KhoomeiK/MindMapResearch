SuicideWatch,fn3bdp5,t1_fmlytzm,1586617177.0,If you need help you have to source it and you are worth it. I am so sorry that your attempts thus far are feeling thwarted or unheard.  That's gotta not feel great but I find focussing on other things like seeing an obstacle not as a problem but a challenge.  Turning negatives into something constructive and positive for yourself so that you don't go into fear or let things spiral down.  Please see yourself as worthy of kindness and show that to yourself even if others don't.

SuicideWatch,fmk87jk,t3_fvq7m5,1586147085.0,Try to think of the things you have left to live for and how transient and short life is anyway and how life can sometimes change for the better out of the blue.  You would be depriving yourself of that opportunity.  Try and let go of the anger towards yourself and others as that is the root cause of suffering.  There are people in the world whose lives are cut short everyday by illness and injury who pray to be able to go on living but can't and you can.🤗

Needless to say I did not go back.  I feel like when you say you have anxiety or depression they use it against you to get away with blue murder.  They are suppose to be there to help, not make you feel more shit or like you can't trust them to help when you are being honest and have laid your soul bare to them.

Unfortunately I'm not in a good head space right now and I want to be the sort of person who can be positive and say that things are better and I'll be better but I had an allergic reaction to trying natural sleeping aids like kava extract and blue lily which are legal here but then my mother was mean on the phone and my daughter was mean because I won't let her go to NZ with her dad's family because of coronovirus outbreak in over two dozen countries now. So then I started drinking as well and then all of a sudden I started sweating bucketloads last night, couldn't walk or make it to my phone to call  ambulance and had to keep forcing myself to breathe as I'd keep forgetting to.  I think I almost died.  I won't be doing any of that again.  It's because when I'm stressed I can't eat more than a few mouthfuls of food, I forget to drink enough water ( did have a bottle of mineral water with me all day but the tropics heat makes me sweat it out as soon as I drink it) and then when I feel like my family has turned there backs on me it brings back the PTSD and I can't take care of myself and I start drinking more than I usually would which is usually just two glasses of wine.  Don't worry, my daughter was with her dad and has been since feb16.  We talked today, she said she would move into my new place with me and still loves me and my mother will help me to move financially and the real estate may extend my time to move in by a bit.  Still feel so sick.  Drank two litres of milk, and 1 burger that I forced down.  Will not do that to myself again.  Was so scary.  Will take better care of myself.❤️ You for your kind soul.

You can feed them meat on a really long stick over a very high fence with the park rangers supervising of course!  Seen sharks too at the aquarium in Townsville, all sorts, tiger sharks, hammerhead sharks etc.  When me dad worked as an engineer on reef link some drunk guy jumped of the floating pontoon on the wrong area where you are not allowed to swim and everyone started screaming, ""shark, shark, get into the dingy ( a small boat that was near the catamaran).  I was one of the first people to run over and witness it first hand!  The hammerhead shark was 4 metres long with a mouth span of a metre and it was coming at him fast.  He only just made it into the dingy then the hammerhead rammed the boat and he almost flipped out of it.  We dragged him back to the pontoon by the rope the dingy was attached to but that what some heart pounding action I can tell you. My dad's friend who worked with him also got bit in the stomach by a shark and they had to pack his stomach with padding and airlift him to hospital.  He survived.  I almost got bit by a sea snake when I had my legs dangling in the water sitting on the pontoon but my dad saw the snake racing at me across the water and swung my legs up and out of the way in time.  Bastard snake launched itself out of the water and hit the pontoon inches from my foot.  They are the most poisonous snakes in the world I think dad told me, and if bitten, because my feet were soft from the water I would have been dead in less than 5 mins.  The Mauri wrass, don't know if I spelt that right are huge gentle fish, my favourites to swim next to and there are beautiful blue starfish that are gorgeous.  Almost touched fire coral once but my dad who was snorkelling two metres under water with me whipped my hand away in time.  The pain is worse than the worse burn you could ever possibly imagine, lucky my dad saved me so many times on the reef.  It's beautiful but deadly as as is much of the wildlife in Australia.
Crab is my favourite seafood, but at 30 dollars a crab bit expensive.  I love scallops and barramundi fish, very yum.

My dad used to make me sleep in his bed until I was 8 and on like 3 or so occassions he would rub his hard on up against me and refuse to let me leave the bed.  I couldn't tell mum, she always took his side.  Then when I was at my dad's brothers place when I was 7, a friend of my uncle's sexually assaulted me and my dad got scared for himself and told me on the car ride home that he would cut my dogs dick off if I told my mum.  When I went white as a ghost when we got home she asked me what happened, I didn't tell her but it was enough to freak dad out and he pulled down my pants and gave me a hiding. One year later my godbrothers molested me in a room at a party and when I told my mum and godmother they didn't believe me and sent me back into the room to be molested further.  Went home that night and wrote on my bedroom wall, I hate mum.   Could go on and on just the tip of the ice berg.  Surprised I am as strong as I am but I know I am better than these fuckers, pardon the French, and would never perpetuate this sick cycle either.
We are tough and strong survivors, a thousand times better than these sick people who did this to us.  Love you Danidee, thanks for your friendship."

Can't believe your mother could do that to you, she really must have been terribly mentally ill.  That guy who she encouraged to groom you inappropriately like that will go straight to hell if there is one!  My daughter just is too much like her dad but sometimes she is so sweet, it's a real heartbreaker for me.  Wish we did live near each other too but know that I am always here for you and will always support you!
So glad you can breathe properly again and are on the mend.  Thankyou so much for your friendship.🤗"
FuckMyLife,fhabu86,t1_fh7dm8r,1581403772.0,"Hey Danidee, I am feeling quite flat and depressed today.  My daughter has been saying really mean things to me, like really hurtful things.  I'm looking for work at the moment as the company I was working for closed down and gave us all 1 days notice!  She is also taller than me and likes to physically kick me in the guts if I tell her to get off her phone or clean her room.  I have 50/50 custody with her dad who I don't speak to and should get a restraining order against as he was very abusive to me and has recently said he wished he'd succeeded pulling me backwards down the staircase and killed me!  Lucky my dress strap broke and he didn't succeed.  We don't live together anymore I have my own place.  I'm taking a break from my daughter at the moment as she is a daddy's girl and bullies me by calling me a loser since i'm not working at present and tells me I have no friends even though I am trying on both fronts.  So depressed, but still trying to take good care of myself.  Love talking to you because you always make me feel better and you help keep me positive.  So hope you feel better soon.  Sending you all my best wishes ❤️."

I get the same awful feeling of an adrenaline rush in the middle of my chest and my heart races a million miles a minute and my chest gets tight and makes me feel like I want to hyperventilate.  I try to explain this feeling to others and they just have no clue what I am talking about they just tell me to fucken breathe!  Would if I could, but hard in the middle of an anxiety attack.  I have PTSD from a whole range of abuse from family and ex boyfriends and now I too cannot mask it.  But there is so much joy in the world to be had and to share.  You are not alone.  Please keep abstaining from weed.  It's a band-aid for feelings that will never go away so we might as well deal, accept, move on.  We deserve joy and happiness weed free and it is possible.

I used weed to mask how I felt about all my negative feelings but I know it was just a band-aid and those thoughts will always be there.  But now I have the clarity to challenge them and instead I am focussing on turning negatives into positives, lemons to lemonade like I should have done a long time ago.

Stay away from friends who smoke.  Delete your contacts number.  Speak positively to yourself "" I am stronger than my craving!! I can and I will beat these feelings!!""
Keep getting support from this forum, it helps to know how many people are in the same situation and just won't stop trying until they beat the urges and get better.
You can do this!!"
leaves,fgusnxz,t1_fgsjfb7,1581128529.0,"You have to believe in yourself.  Forget about your failures and try again, don't stop trying!  You can't swap between weed choices, that's not quitting.  If it's difficult and shit yes it is, there are some options.
1) taper off ( smoke less and less so when you quit the withdrawals aren't as intense)
2) plan an appointment with a doctor when you do quit and get medication for sleep or anxiety, will assist you to handle withdrawals (if you can sleep and have less anxiety it will make the world of difference to how you feel)
3) ask friends and family to be supportive. ( If friends are a problem because they smoke ask them not to do it around you or abstain from seeing them until you are better.  If you don't have much support then stick to this Reddit forum daily.)
4) Try sleep and relaxation poses from yoga (Google that, but Child's pose is my favourite to release stress and you can do that on your bed comfortably.)
5) eat healthy and take a multi vitamin it will help you feel less shit.  If you get nausea and headaches from quitting drink ginger tea renound for curing nausea and sometimes headaches). Soup helps alot when you feel you can't keep much down.
6) reward yourself with self care, long baths and showers for if you get the sweats from withdrawals like I do.
7) exercise, it gets that shit out of your system quicker and is a good distraction.
8) you will get sad and angry and frustrated, we all do from quitting.  Try to force yourself to distract yourself from that.  Funny DVDs, funny you tube videos, books etc etc whatever stops you feeling and thinking in the wrong direction.
9) join marijuana anonymous or a twelve step program, it has worked for SO many people who owe their lives to it.
10) and finally, congratulate yourself on every day, week, year that you have freed yourself from this vice you no longer need or want!!!
You can do it.  No more negative self talk! You absolutely can do it!!!"

Just scared this is the beginning of worse things to come with the weather, but extremely bad unprecedented fires have hit the Amazon (lungs of our planet), California fires and fires of a magnitude rarely seen in Greece and other European countries last year as well because temperatures have gone up about ten degrees in so many places during the hotter times of the year.  Scary shit!!
Would love to visit Sweden, haven't been there seen I was 12, best time of my life though, skating on frozen lakes, having traditional saunas and rolling in the snow afterwards.  Herrings take some getting used to though, an acquired taste but then so is Vegemite in my country, lol!

leaves,fgsd06l,t1_fgsallo,1581080839.0,"Wow, thanks for the insight!  Yeah I seriously believed those polls especially about Denmark being one of the happiest countries in the world, guess it's cause they are all on antidepressants then, lol!  But seasonal depression is rife over in Nordic countries because of lack of enough sunlight I think I read that somewhere.  We have to much sunshine in North Queensland and I hate the heat and constant sunshine makes me feel like I'm living in a constant sauna and actually makes me feel really aggravated and irritable.  I pray for the rain in summer, only time the weather makes me happy.  I knew about the high taxes but I was told by my mother that that's because they use money to better the lives of their people but she left Sweden 42 years ago so she is probably out of the loop.
  She did say the country was getting taken over by muslims though and foreigners, their  prayer bells and mosques taking over the cities even when she was there. I'm not a racist but it sounds like they like to let perhaps too many immigrants in, soon there will be no blonds left what with genetics and all.
Have no idea about this socialism debate will have to research that or ask my cousins.  
I kind of like how Sweden is so environmentally conscious though as the world is turning into a polluted place and Australia is definitely affected by climate change, bushfires have been going since about Nov 2019 and are still going, 1 billion of our beautiful animals dead.

Tea's are a god send for me,  that and really long walks in nature to clear the mind and help exhaust yourself.  I love reading so back in the day before weed, that's what used to get me to sleep, reading a really good book for like an hour, makes my eyelids droop.  Also congratulating yourself on accomplishments you have made that day instead of concentrating on negative things and being grateful for the things in life that you have eg; your health if it is good, kind things you have done for people relaxed me and stops the monkey mind.  Maybe even stretching before bed to loosen up your muscles can be beneficial for sleep too especially Child's pose from yoga.
