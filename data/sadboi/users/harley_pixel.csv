NewOrleans,flki8ov,t1_fljtu26,1585241420.0,"Vilify?  No. New Orleans and Mardi Gras itself are being vilified worldwide for the current pandemic as the perfect breeding grounds to be named as an epicenter to this unnerving virus.  For someone who was a leader in our state's health department, I would not have expected something as gross as picking up someone else's cup to share is not a common enough action to bring up as if it's a vital  part to the Carnival season. Imagine the immense impact this (pandemic) will already have on the local economy.  Daily I've seen stories about our sewers overflowing, videos of rats just hanging out on Bourbon, story after story about sanitation, and yet those are all true, but the true stories being brought to the public don't bother me, because those we can actually fix it improve upon. But, sharing cups? How can we show that we as a city/state have taken care of our cup sharing problem to further prevent mass viral spread, if it's not really the issue? 

Oh, and you forgot to add in the Saints. Nola, Mardi Gras, and the Saints or any combination of the 3 shall not be spoken of in vain. Lol just kidding.. Seriously, though, I'm immunocompromised and don't take lightly the thought of someone drinking from cup and thinking it's okay.  Apparently, though, this sub clearly shows I'm out numbered here and I've been blissfully ignorant during the rituals of cup swapping."

Nor is sharing cups the theme of any parade I've witnessed or been a part of. And yes, I've had wine poured into my mouth before.  My point of this post being that ""sharing cups"" is not something you see people readily doing or encouraged just because it's Mardi Gras and I'm sure it wasn't what the leading factor to the situation we are currently facing."

NewOrleans,flixads,t1_flisn87,1585193011.0,"I specifically stated she was talking about Mardi Gras and no the Box ify Wine parade is a foot parade, in which the procession carry boxes of wine and pour wine directly into your mouth from the spout or into your cup. They don't pass out cups for people to share. 
And, my point was to say when describing Mardi Gras to the rest of the world, there are plenty other festive and germy things that happen during this time, why the hell does sharing cups make top of the list? How about the fact that it never fails for everything to be wet, even if it doesn't rain. And it doesn't matter how many times you tell a kid don't pick up the wet beads.. they pick up the wet ones.
For the record, as a person who loves to drink and have a good time, I'm safe about it. If I put my cup down then it's empty, I don't pick up random cups; if I lose my cup, pour me another one. Being roofied gives you the worst headache the next morning and for some reason your asshole hurts."

SuicideWatch,fkcxb12,t1_fkb8sar,1584063307.0,"Everything you state could not be closer to the truth, but the side of insurance people don't see- I do. I know my place and never forget I am replaceable. I can only hope the next person is able to see the importance of treating each claim as if you know the person. 
I've been at the center of uncovering 3 multi-million dollar insurance fraud schemes, not to mention the countless days and nights spent fighting for people who will never know my name. Or, even those that do call me for help, because I've been to and won state level insurance appeals for people who wouldn't be alive without the treatments they were initially wrongly denied. 
See? The problem is people are ignorant to what is rightfully theirs.  I am not saying it's right that people have to jump through hoops to get what should just be easily available, but I'm saying the hoops are there because criminals don't want to try very hard. The fact that VERY few people know their insurance plans inside and out leads to ignorant statements about people paying to much or instance didn't pay enough.  9/10 it's the doctors office wrongly billing the patients or it's the member who doesn't understand if you pay a small premium you're likely to have a high deductible.  I've had conversations with CEOs, CFOs, and others in very high status positions that couldn't explain the difference between cost-share, premiums, deductibles, copays, coinsurance, OOP/OON/POS, and the list could go on; yet, they claim to offer their employees the best insurance plans and rates available. Bullshit, many companies have had the same grandfathered plans for the last 15 years because it's cheaper for them. Quite frankly, just like that company wanting to keep their payments low to us, we want to spend less too. So, if your company doesn't change the benefits yearly, you may want to ask why. Why not adjust employee rates to meet what is needed every few years?  
I'm just saying, yes, US healthcare is a very unnecessary corporate business in which the wrong people are making millions, but people don't take the time to work a system that is easily maneuverable.  VERY few people know that first level insurance appeals resulting in a not covered denial are required by law to be reviewed by a second outside government authority, before reaching the next appeal level.  If overturned here or any level after, the insurance company is fined thousands upon thousands of dollars. We don't want to chance that, and unless it's spelled out in black in white somewhere chances are it will be paid on a simple first level appeal. 

It shouldn't be so confusing and scary to seek payment for a service so many people receive worldwide freely, but it is and it's not going to change for a while. Unless people educate themselves and learn to navigate these things, it will forever stay the same.  Ignorance isn't always bliss, and well Americans like to stay blissfully unaware."
SuicideWatch,fka5fft,t1_fk8dcv2,1583993183.0,"I am literally the evil in which you speak about right now- I pay and deny claims for a massive insurance company. In addition, I fight for people outside the office as a representative because medical insurance has the most unnecessary corporate bullshit red tape I've ever seen in my life. The biggest problem with the United States healthcare system?  Ignorance. And I mean flat out ignorance. When I say your insurance company isn't the problem, people go to screaming. The only claims we deny are for billing errors, seeing an OON provider without making sure there isn't someone in network first, or for things that are not covered which.  You have access to your EOC/COC/summary of benefits/pharmaceutical formulary- anything non covered is laid out in your plan documents and benefits. If it's not, then you can appeal and get it paid. HMO, PPO, Egwp/indv, Mcare, Mcaid whatever you have I guarantee you it's likely payable."

I grew up in a smallish southern town, if you don't know somebody- you're a nobody.  I've watched these types keep their entitled attitudes all the way from a two story Tudor to a double wide in the trailerhood.
