Might be more accurate since it's taking muscle mass into account."

I can definitely relate to your situation. I worked two jobs while in grad school full time, tired and overworked constantly. That couldn't possibly compare to my sister having a 2 year old to raise. My family didn't realize how hard I worked during that time and it was really frustrating. I think partly or was due to me being the first to go to college, and my grandma didn't understand why I didn't just go settle down and have kids. Sigh."

I ordered vegan white chocolate from the No Whey brand. It's really sweet, so I didn't use a chocolate drizzle on top. I also reduced the brown sugar and powdered sugar in the frosting."

gis,f1zvypa,t1_f1y1x7c,1569850996.0,"Well I have work experience, but it seems many job descriptions ask for many programming languages. I don't have experience with Pro or Enterprise either. My program was focused on research and theory. They had one Python course they I took, but without using it consistently, it's easy to forget. That's one thing you can teach yourself though. Oh and you can get a personal ESRI license for $100/year. I did with the thought of getting Pro experience."
gis,f1xvo8i,t3_dawqza,1569804735.0,"I went to a state school for my MS. I had a graduate assistant position that paid about $600/month and my tuition (~$4500/semester). I still had to pay fees, which I did in cash, about $1500 per semester. I was lucky enough to have a cheap apartment and another job, and while I didn't have any free time, I feel pretty lucky to get a master's without any debt. 
I'm glad for the education, but I certainly didn't learn all the programming and database stuff so many jobs ask for. I'm interviewing for jobs now and it's frustrating to have more education than is required but not the technical skills they are looking for."

AskWomen,ewy4wrr,t3_cqofrr,1565874789.0,"This has happened to me just this year. I met two guys on OKC in January very different but I felt like I clicked with both of them. I'm never the first one to make a move, and guy1 did, we texted a lot more than I did with guy2. Guy1 is a musician, while I'm very outdoorsy- I thought opposites attract. He was the most emotionally open partner I'd had to that point. So after a couple weeks I told Guy2 I was going to pursure a relationship with Guy1. He seemed fine and we stayed in touch as friends. 
Guy1 was divorced for less than a year when we met. He seemed to be over it, didn't talk about her, he is in therapy so I thought he was okay. Fast forward to June, and he says he doesn't love me, where in other relationships he would have said it by then. I think he was afraid to get hurt again. I was crushed. I really thought he was the one. 

Since the breakup, guy2 and I have been talking and hanging out, and are officially dating as of last weekend. He's not afraid to show affection, we click better, have more hobbies in common, etc. I just wonder why I close guy 1 in the first place. I guess my takeaway is I was glad to have a friendship with guy2 before dating. I've never had that before. I always went straight into a relationship without getting to know them first. I feel like I can really be myself around him."
