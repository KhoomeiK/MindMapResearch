I'm not making any assumptions. You feel it's wrong to make your kids face repercussions for their very obviously wrong actions, therefore you are part of the reason kids today are so entitled.

Obviously not every single kid these days is an asshole, not everyone is entitled, but face it. Kids today feel like they're owed something, and so do a lot of young adults, because of the way their parents babied them as teenagers and children. Obviously some kids get babied and don't turn out that way, and some don't get babied and do turn out that way, which is why you have no way of knowing what this specific case is caused by. But if this even IS caused by parenting, which you don't know, it's because the parents were too lenient and took a passive approach like so many parents these days do.

Funny how Reddit, which is massively composed of people who fall on the left and sympathize with minorities and women more than any other groups, still agree with me. Because I'm stating facts. Continue making a fool of yourself, I'm out."
elex,f5wddbt,t1_f5u347t,1572521195.0,"I don't think the thrashing is unfair, considering how broken and unbalanced the game is. I mean hell, half the skills straight up lie to you, and the other half aren't used in game! It's obviously a broken, buggy mess. I ran into so many problems that slowed gameplay down to a halt if I didn't reload my save every few hours.

THAT BEING SAID, it's an AMAZING buggy, broken mess full of detail and amazing writing, beautiful scenery, thrilling fights, and mystery. It definitely could have, and should have been made better, but even so it is an awesome game. Given a higher budget and more time to fix bugs and shit, I think that a sequel could be a GOTY contender."
WatchPeopleDieInside,f5wd32a,t1_f5wcqsm,1572520981.0,"I'm not ""melting down"" because I'm commenting. I'm perfectly fine. But if you support BLM you support violence and lies. They do not tell the truth, they cherry pick bits of fact and use them out of context in order to fit their narrative. The article could say, ""Group A, on average, tends to enjoy living on the east side of town, so Group B lives on the west side."" And BLM will go out saying, ""You see that? Group B is taking the west side and forcing group a to live on the east side!"" They're not telling the truth, they are a hate group. They've just got you fooled. I suggest you do a little more research, and not on sites biased towards the groups you're looking into."
WatchPeopleDieInside,f5wcmbo,t1_f5wc9cn,1572520627.0,"BLM is a hate fueled piece of shit of an organization. Fuck BLM. Black lives do matter, so do any other lives, but there are other ways to stand up for what's right than to incite violence and to spread lies. Fuck BLM. You made a racist remark, not a joke, and not based in reality. I didn't melt down and lose my shit, I insulted you for being racist. Lol. It was literally 4 words. That's a meltdown to you?"
JUSTNOFAMILY,f5wc9xw,t1_f5w87z2,1572520368.0,"I mean, if they turn 18 and have absolutely no respect for you and treat you like shit while still expecting money, then...yeah. Kick them out. They can come back when they learn some respect. It isn't the parents responsibility to make sure their adult child can behave properly, it's the adults responsibility to respect people around them. The real world wouldn't put up with it, neither should parents. This is why kids are so entitled these days and feel like they're owed something, because people like you just let them walk all over you."
WatchPeopleDieInside,f5wbu2v,t1_f5wbkhn,1572520026.0,"Yeah, so am I. Doesn't mean you can't hate other white people. Plenty of white people siding with BLM and shit like that, discriminating against other white people. Just like male feminists, they exist. Might as well be a Jewish Nazi."

No, I'm not saying all black people are bad, so don't reply with some, ""Hurr durr, racism"" bullshit. It's part of the culture that many, many black people have escaped or are trying to escape, but it still is there and still plays a major role."

instantbarbarians,f5i22dt,t1_f5gxwlq,1572210164.0,"What? He jumped over a car that was only as tall as the ramp and did a 180°. I'm not saying everyone can do it, but it isn't quite as amazing as you're exaggerating it to be. I wasn't rude in the slightest, I simply stated what I thought, and even expressed that it doesn't hurt anyone and I wouldn't ever try and say anything about it to anyone. I was literally just expressing my opinion in the most polite way possible. Judging by your defensiveness and aggression towards someone who doesn't understand something you personally like, I WOULD say that you're the one who is no fun at parties...but I'd never use that overused, cliche, trash insult because I can come up with something I haven't heard 1,000 other people say."

Like if I spend the day swimming, when I lay down in bed and relax sometimes it feels like I'm still floating in water. Same thing with skating. When I used to go skating during field trips, I would go to bed that night and relax and it would feel like I was still rolling around."

I understand being hyped about something, but to me it seems like everyone just want to act wacky to draw attention to themselves after someone else already did something cool. Like, dude, control yourself. You don't gotta throw yourself into a massive frenzy because some guy at a party did something cool.

Obviously they're not hurting anyone, so I would never step in and stop them from doing it, and if it makes them happy then more power to them. But to me personally it just seems kinda stupid and cringy."

Plus, of course the husband should be happy too. That's what the phrase means. The husband has a happy life as long as he keeps the wife happy. The phrase is usually from the husbands point of view."
TIHI,f5dsycc,t1_f5da3hz,1572159058.0,"Maybe things have changed since I was in school, but what reason would a school kid have to get less than 4 hours of sleep a night? I barely ever even took homework home, I just did it in school. I had more time for sleep then than I do now that I'm an adult trying to balance my job, girlfriend, gaming, and friends. And I still get more than 4 hours a night, unless I sacrifice sleep for gaming time."

lowspecgamer,f5ds5bd,t1_f5dni1q,1572158683.0,"Well, it's a good thing you can return the game for 24 hours after buying it. I'll download it when I get home, screw with the settings and see how it goes. If it won't run at an acceptable level, I'll return it and buy it on PS4. I just also don't wanna miss out on the modding scene for this game. Obsidian, in my opinion, is basically gonna become the new Bethesda now that Bethesda has been shooting themselves in the feet repeatedly. I have a feeling that since they're giving Outer Worlds modding capabilities on a similar level to Bethesda games, a lot of modders are probably gonna move towards Outer Worlds and hopefully future Obsidian games."
lowspecgamer,f5dmip8,t1_f5dlsso,1572156093.0,"I would guarantee that I could run Witcher or Witcher 2, but I doubt I could run Witcher 3. I just don't know anything about specs. I've never gotten a gaming PC before, I've never had the money. I had to look up how to find my specs for me to even post on here. I don't know what any of it means, on a functional level. Obviously RAM is Random Access Memory and CPU is Central Processing Unit, but I really couldn't tell you how any of these effects gaming or what graphics card is better than another. Lol."
