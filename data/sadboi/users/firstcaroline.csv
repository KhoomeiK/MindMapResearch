Just simply says i shouldnt be feeling this... my lessions couldnt possibly get bigger from one mri to the next.  And move on lets see what happens. Not sure how study of MS is a science if we are sent home with a good luck kick in the behind.  Anyhow got sidetracked there.

I feel like a dork.... oh i dont have the energy and power to shower! gosh thats like a basic part of life i should be able to handle but nope.  I think to myself.. oh my hair can last without another wash!! Most of the time i rush some soap & cold water on the parts that need it and rush out.  
And try explaining this to your family... i just showered so i need like an hour to recuperate.  😕
They don't get it and don't care to try to get it.  I'm just lazy.
Wow that went deep😂

Our bodies hate the heat.  Im glad you made it thru this experience and hopefully it doesn't keep happening for you that bad every time.  I've blanked out a few times also but it's not recurring often.  I have the shower handle thing and do not get under the shower until i have felt with my hand the perfect temperature.  Weird thing for me is that the water feels terribly hot on my body but cold on my head.   Same water!  Very strange

I can explain what the dmt does till im blue in the face but still they think the infusion is curing me.  Just annoys me to all ends no one cares enough to read a few pages on the internet about ""me""  and poof no stupid words hooded in ""caring"" tone.  
Im not asking for anyone to write a research paper.  Well alas... i shall try to sleep another wee bit.

Thanks for letting me vent on your post.  To answer your rhetorical question, no.  No magic.  Closest to magic holds too much stygma for me to use (weed)."

I can't find something that will just bring the pain and spasticity down a notch.  All those side effects you are having is not a way to live.  And they dont sound like MS symptoms.  

my 2 cents... get rid of the alcohol  slowly decrease your norm.  Not everyone can go cold 🦃.  Start slow and maybe journal it.  Phones have many apps helpful for this.  When you start seeing success day after day you will be able to take on a bigger morsel.  

Good luck!"

I find that if i have had a particularly hard day, i need to watch myself and my responces to the people i love.  One minute Im fine, the next I'm irate over a paper plate not being in the trash.  Moods all over the place.  Other extreme happens a lot also... i will take some weird offense from a normal conversation.  Then spend 30 minutes in my bathroom crying my eyes out because the ""world is against me""

Its horrible to think of what my kids that live with me go thru.  What a mess.  Copaxone or tysabri... drugs arent the problem... the dark holes in our CNS is the issue.
