That‚Äôs essentially it for me.

It‚Äôs like I said, it‚Äôs this fear of everything I‚Äôve been told coming to life, this fear that I really am not good enough. Which is dumb :( As writers, as artists, we have to learn and evolve. We‚Äôre not just born perfect and knowing everything lol.

ALSO.... I got so happy when I saw that you‚Äôre a lyrical writer!! I‚Äôve been told before that my writing is very old-school, but that‚Äôs because I take inspiration from the classics (in terms of my poetry at least). It‚Äôs what I love though, so if you‚Äôd ever like to share any of your writing with me, my PM‚Äôs are open!!

The second stanza was my personal favorite. Both the imagery and the idea of these people who are supposed to save us holding an immediate burial were powerful. A very sad kind of powerful, leading me to want to mourn the cat man himself, and furthermore, prompting me to want to properly bury him.

When I was young, about seven or eight, my family and I moved into an efficiency. Upon arrival, I noticed two things: the walls outside were charred, and there was a name painted over on my bedroom door - Victoria. 

I mention that because it‚Äôs super important. Anyways, things start out fine but not entirely. At night, I hear footsteps, I see a bright orange glow through the space between my door, my closet door opens on its own all at night. 

Then things escalate, I‚Äôm sleep walking and waking up in my moms bed with no memory or recollection of how I got there. Pets are dying GRUESOMELY. Fish jump out of closed tank (seriously, we found them on the floor), turtles commit cannibalism and eat each other. Lights turn off randomly and my mom feels a presence lay down next to her in bed from time to time. 

Then shit hits the fan. About two months in, while dealing with all this, we get a knock at our door past midnight. It‚Äôs the cops, they tell us a little girl called screaming for help because of a fire. It‚Äôs just my brother and I. We have no sister. This happens three more times, in a row. Then, after that, I fall horribly ill and land in the hospital and my brother breaks his arm after someone stepped on it by accident (he fell and someone ran over his arm). 

There was even a time I was left home alone and I ran out of the house in my underwear and waited for my mom because of how scared I was. The energy in that house was just so evil. We left finally after about four months of living there.

horror,fn83vxe,t3_fzto0j,1586733353.0,"Watched this film once at 17 (I‚Äôm 20 now) after years of avoiding it. Every October they‚Äôd advertise all these horror films for a marathon and Exorcist would just terrify me. 

I loved it, and I give it praise, but I‚Äôll never watch it again. First time in years that I had to sleep with the lights on. It just terrified me that much."

camphalfblood,fn7jl9j,t3_g03f0z,1586721625.0,"The gods are, for the most part, horrible. Imagine being stuck with them for all of eternity after the hell they put you through. I think it‚Äôs equal parts Percy being done with their shit and him not wanting to lose his mother and Annabeth."
camphalfblood,fn5ng29,t3_fzoyra,1586669781.0,"It‚Äôs funny because my least favorite in middle school was Sea of Monsters and my favorite was Battle of the Labyrinth. Upon my reread, practically 10 years later, Sea of Monsters became a favorite and Battle of the Labyrinth my least favorite. BotL was just boring for me, I don‚Äôt know why."

Also, your kid is going to be curious about a lot of things, some much worse than coffee. This is a perfect learning lesson for you and your wife on how to handle certain situations pertaining to your religious beliefs and your child."

camphalfblood,fn1gk3u,t3_fyqkh1,1586561557.0,I don‚Äôt see why not but it makes me wonder as to what kind of abilities/powers a child of his would posses.

selfharm,fmz25vz,t3_fyavng,1586503557.0,Didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be so triggering for me but great share nonetheless! Thank you
suggestmeabook,fmymy01,t3_fy7iax,1586490129.0,"Not necessarily similar but The Song of Achilles had the same impact on me as The Ocean at the End of the Lane. Both of which are now officially my favorites. 

The Song of Achilles essentially follows the story of Achilles and his relationship with Patroclus. The story is so beautifully written and heartbreaking and powerful and agh, I need to read it again."
camphalfblood,fmy1ch1,t1_fmy12kl,1586476048.0,"Of course, you‚Äôre absolutely right! I‚Äôm reading Mark of Athena right now and I just remembered that through Reyna and Annabeth‚Äôs conversation it‚Äôs mentioned that Athena‚Äôs Roman form is a maiden. Makes a ton of sense now. 

But yeah I‚Äôve never wondered if Athena‚Äôs children could reproduce the same way until I read this thread lol. Thanks for the comment!"
camphalfblood,fmxzyl0,t1_fmxyrec,1586475236.0,Wait... Do you think Annabeth has the same ability as her mother? In terms of making babies I mean.
camphalfblood,fmuu8nm,t3_fwyvwt,1586399004.0,"The Song of Achilles!! It‚Äôs my favorite book EVER. I read it this year and I already want to read it again. It‚Äôs fully adult and very beautifully written. Afterwards, you can read Circe by the same author, although I really didn‚Äôt like it as much as TSoA."

Scoobydoo,fmputpv,t3_fwq72d,1586287740.0,From what I remember it ends on a cliff hanger but keep in mind I watched this show when it first came out and never since. Might give it a binge watch cause I have nothing else to do lol

What if ‚Äùpulling off the slickest thing [he‚Äôs] done‚Äù was... disappearing without a trace??"

First and foremost, thank you so much for writing this comment and second, thank you for writing this comment haha. Great advice and super helpful, I‚Äôll make sure to take everything into consideration. 

Writing really is terrific and despite my dislike for essays, I appreciate the craft and the work that goes into them. Plus, a well written essay can sometimes make for a very good read. Maybe I should read more of them."
englishmajors,fmaaigk,t1_fm9hmfl,1585888166.0,"This is so true! I had to do a research paper for my ENC1102 class. We chose the piece and the topic (I chose The Yellow Wallpaper & Women‚Äôs roles in the 19th century). I started day one and worked on it for two weeks, loved every single moment of it! I move onto my bachelors in the fall so I‚Äôm very happy to hear that :)"
HHN,fm8h0x4,t1_fm8agpz,1585849232.0,"Smartest thing they can do is move it to next year. It‚Äôll still technically be their 30th just not consecutively. I was thinking they‚Äôd maybe do a full October and a full November this year but even then, it‚Äôs just a recipe for disaster. Limited capacity could work but they‚Äôd have to have strict guidelines in the parks as well."

Sorry for like making it jokey I swear that‚Äôs just how I cope. It‚Äôs (weirdly) comforting knowing I‚Äôm not the only one dealing with this Covid-19 induced anxiety"
