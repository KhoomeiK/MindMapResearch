Second of all, being sexually attracted to anthromorphic animals does *not* mean that you are a furry either. If you don’t want to identify as a furry, you’re no a furry. That’s that.

As long as you don’t have a plan to kill yourself, or kill others, she can’t tell anyone. Personally, I’ve been going to therapy for about two years. My therapist asked me one day if I was straight, and I hesitated with the question—I said “yes.” She soon later told me that she believes I lied since I hesitated; I confessed and told her I lied. Then she said to me, “are you bi, gay, or something else?” I told her I was the second question. 

That was that. 

If it makes you feel any better, I’m 17.

I think it can be important to tell your therapist, especially if it’s something that’s eating you up inside. I still struggle with my sexuality, however. I’m very insecure about telling people because I don’t like it to define me. I mean, all it is is sexual attraction—I hate how it has to be so deep."

mentalillness,f92mv3r,t1_f92m686,1575037200.0,"Well, for me, I didn’t ever really think I was bipolar.

I told her that I can randomly get spurts of energy and become super talkative. She immediately told me that that means I’m bipolar, and asked me how it made me feel. I just told her it makes sense. When I’m having my “manic” episodes, the thoughts in my head are so rapid that I’ll almost always regret what I tell people, because it’s excessive amounts of information, I do get very energetic and jumpy—just a few hours ago I cleaned a whole bunch of Thanksgiving dirty dishes that I didn’t have to do—also cleaning the whole kitchen and throwing out trash too. Which is odd, because I’m usually attached to my bed, and also being extremely irritable for no reason. It’s really annoying because I often do doubt myself. Mainly because my manic episodes only last a couple of hours, and I’m mainly depressed as hell. I cycle in moods a lot."
mentalillness,f92loom,t1_f92jw95,1575036055.0,"Depression can change your perspective on life in general. Antidepressants can definitely make you more depressed, unfortunately, as it has for me. Especially since I was misdiagnosed with clinical depression (I’m bipolar II). They initally made me feel happier, but later it would be followed by me being more irritable, depressed, and more suicidal. I’ve been on three different kinds of antidepressants, as well. So you might have to take different SSRIs if some aren’t giving you any results, or are making you worse.

All in all, never expect to get better from antidepressants too soon, as they can take a while before they’ll work in your system. SSRIs generally take a few months (1-3 months or more) before results will begin showing up. If you begin to feel immediate results, however, it’s actually a red flag to them not working in the long run. If your antidepressants are making you *worse* that’s also a red flag; the best thing to do is to wait a few weeks to a month before you stop taking them, because your depression might make you feel doubtful while you’re on them, or you might just be having mood swings. I don’t recommend stopping them yourself however; schedule an appointment with your psychiatrist so they can help wean you off of them, so they can prescribe you with another SSRI to see which one (hopefully) works for you. 

I also recommend going to therapy, too. Even if it’s inconsistent. It always makes me feel better to talk to someone professionally. They can also provide you with coping strategies while you’re on your meds! 

Hope this helps"

One day, one of my friends pressured me to kill an animal when I was 11, so I did. (It gave me an intense adrenaline rush.)

I told people about it as something I was proud of, and they all said what I did was heartless and evil. As a result, I stopped torturing insects from it because I started feeling depressed and guilty for it. I didn’t know what I did was even bad.

Unfortunately, I have had moments of relapse where I started hurting animals due to paranoia and anger, but I felt incredibly guilty and disgusted with myself from it. Inside, I was suffering, and didn’t know what to do about it. I knew I was getting worse, so I decided to reach out for therapy again.

I’m very aware of my condition because I’ve opened up to my therapist about everything; I cannot own pets at the moment, but it’s fine with me as long as I won’t hurt anything.
