Futurism,fr3g4fn,t3_gmctrb,1589856680.0,"This is very confusing to me. Let me see if I got that right:

You take a proton and push it closer and closer to an atom. This requires some energy (activation energy, 5-10 eV). At some point the gravitational pull of the atom becomes stronger than the electromagnetic repulsion and the proton gets pulled very close to the atom, releasing lots of energy (up to keV range). Now you have a stable (?!) binuclear atom or if you use a deuteron instead it decays by merging of the nuclei leaving you with a regular old atom. 

What I don't get at all is where the mention of a graviton in the conclusion comes from?"

If you are in orbit around a planet, you are moving really fast relative to that planet. If you teleport to a high altitude, you are going to fall down and not stay in orbit, you need a large sideward velocity. 

Also everything in orbit around the sun has a large sideward velocity relative to it so you can't just drop stuff into the sun. 

If you teleport from the equator to a pole you are gonna die. At the equator you have a large sideward velocity. So when you appear at the pole (little to no velocity) you are moving really fast compared to the ground and air. Not sure if you would burn up right away from air friction but at latest when you hit the ground you are gone.

Sometimes you can explain things away with enough assumptions but nobody ever bothers to think about these things and add them to the canon."

And the nitpicking is exactly the problem. You can nitpick whatever parts you want and justify just about anything with it. 

It is an inherently illogical set of premises and per the falsum rule you can derive any conclusion from that. The existence of an allpowerful being alone is in itself a contradiction not to mention a benevolent allpowerful being that does not interfere ever.

Not to mention that it isn't even a proper set of premises, it gives implied premises you're supposed to derive through interpretation which leaves a huge margin of error or room for manipulation.

Just think about what it has been used for: The witch trials, the crusades, it was the basis for the power of monarchs in and basically propped up the entire dark ages, the genocide that started the USA was justified with it, discrimination against women was justified with it, slavery was justified with it and that's just what I can come up with from the top of my head. A quick google search later here are some more: Child abuse (proverbs 13:24), torture during the Spanish inquisition (not directly derived from the bible but justified from the power of the catholic church), child marriage (numbers 31:18), loads of cults and faith healers use it to prey on the vulnerable, discrimination against lgbt people (leviticus 20:13), even the Nazis managed to lay the words in such a way to make it fit their agenda. There is even a wikipedia article on the violence of Christianity.

A value system that can be used to justify atrocities is not a very good system. And don't give me that crap about ""but I use it differently"" that is beside the point. The point is it *can* be used for evil, therefore a system that adopts the good parts while minimizing the chance for it to be misused and puts that in clear words that minimize the chance for it to be twisted by people with evil agendas is obviously a better system that should replace the broken one. An example for such a system (or rather a basis, everybody should build their own) are [the tenets of The Satanic Temple](https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/tenets).

And don't get me wrong, Islam is just as bad, Judaism as well. Buddhism is slightly better because of nonviolence but still illogical.

Also this whole idea of proof by quote disgusts me. ""It's true because X said so"" is a fallacy. Just hearing somebody try such stupidity makes me want to puke.

I get that the absurd is scary but throwing logic out the window to deal with that will lead to human extinction sooner or later. It wasn't called the dark ages for no reason and the beginning of the end for religion wasn't called he enlightenment for nothing. I'm only disappointed it's taking so long."
