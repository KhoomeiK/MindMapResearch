Teachers,ey9ovkl,t3_cw5d27,1566948704.0,Thank you for sharing this touching story! I really needed to read that since the new school year is approaching! A reminder of why we do what we do is always nice to see!
unpopularopinion,ey9kbyz,t3_cw3rlt,1566945398.0,"It’s more about what you do in life, how you treat people, and how you make them feel. No one gets to choose what they’re dealt. What counts is what you do after!"
NoStupidQuestions,ey9jokt,t3_cvy34d,1566944942.0,Yes!! I work 10 hours a day with driving let’s call it 11. If I get the recommended 8 hours of sleep a night that means I can spend maybe 5 hours of time at home...if not I’m running errands or having after school activities. It’s a bummer...also why I end up being a homebody on the weekends! I get it. Don’t ever grown up!
Anxiety,ey9i2u6,t3_cw8ahf,1566943824.0,"I GET THIS. My anxiety just recently got terrible over the last year!! I’m a teacher and this week we have meetings all week before the kids come back next week and I was sooo anxious before I got there. I’ve been taking a CBD gummy in the morning and making that I’m just focusing on my breathing. My anxiety often results in feeling nauseous and then feeling like that makes me get even more anxious.

Someone was also telling me about this type of practice or exercise where you basically make yourself face the fear and after about 20 minutes you show yourself that it’s not in fact as overwhelming as you thought as long as you can make it through those 20 minutes. So I’ve been setting my goal to focus on just getting through the first 20 and I feel so much better about it. 

You’re amazing for going to law school and I hope this helps!! Best of luck!"

AmItheAsshole,ex6l5ic,t3_cre4qy,1566047460.0,"NTA My mother would say that I looked like a lesbian with my hoop in? 1. What the fuck? 2. That’s not even an insult? lol having a hoop makes me look like I like women? Okay.

The point of this being she’s said a lot of things and I came to the breaking point about 2 years ago and I just stopped talking to her for a lot of reasons...this one being a small one in comparison to the other things. 

I finally proved my point and after almost a year of not speaking to her she finally realized how to treat me. She stopped all of her insulting and realized that it’s worth being kind if she wants a good relationship with me. 

Maybe it’s worth giving it a try? Sometimes standing up for yourself is exactly what you need to do to make people treat you the way you should be treated!"

askpsychology,ewc5t5t,t3_cnbx45,1565278662.0,"Can we talk about how dreams are just your short term memories being consolidated into your long term memory? That’s the reason that you can never dream something that you haven’t seen before. 

I can get behind the fact of you dreaming about something you have been thinking about or maybe that your subconscious is coming out in a dream but that’s about it."

AmItheAsshole,evn1an7,t3_ckdvux,1564616991.0,"NTA. when I was 16 I worked / saved money from previous birthdays so I could buy a car. Granted my dad was a mechanic so it made fixing up a beater easier but I managed a 1996 Malibu (this was 10 years ago). I paid $1200 and it was the best car ever. It lasted me years where I treasured it because it was MINE. Also it ended up with a few bumps and bruises as first cars do. 

Now I’m 26 and drive an 05 Malibu that I also bought for a few thousand dollars. We’re going on 5 years together.  I just don’t see the sense in buying a new car until I have a family and I’m established!"

dating_advice,evmv4wv,t3_ck8ods,1564613914.0,Be playful!! And I swear I fell in love with my boyfriend (of almost 3 years) the first night we met. I had never laughed so hard in my life...we connected right away. I know this sounds so childish but if you’re walking go for her hand!!

My boyfriend has put in fences before. He works as a farm manger so he’s used to fence and posts. Our landlord just fixed this house. Everything is new so we would definitely make sure that it’s up to his standards. I think that’s probably why he won’t want to put more money into the house by putting in a fence."

I think we might end up putting it up ourselves. It might take longer but it would save us a couple thousand dollars! Thanks! I’ll start calling around today!"
