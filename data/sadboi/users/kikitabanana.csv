NoStupidQuestions,ey9jokt,t3_cvy34d,1566944942.0,Yes!! I work 10 hours a day with driving let‚Äôs call it 11. If I get the recommended 8 hours of sleep a night that means I can spend maybe 5 hours of time at home...if not I‚Äôm running errands or having after school activities. It‚Äôs a bummer...also why I end up being a homebody on the weekends! I get it. Don‚Äôt ever grown up!
Anxiety,ey9i2u6,t3_cw8ahf,1566943824.0,"I GET THIS. My anxiety just recently got terrible over the last year!! I‚Äôm a teacher and this week we have meetings all week before the kids come back next week and I was sooo anxious before I got there. I‚Äôve been taking a CBD gummy in the morning and making that I‚Äôm just focusing on my breathing. My anxiety often results in feeling nauseous and then feeling like that makes me get even more anxious.

Someone was also telling me about this type of practice or exercise where you basically make yourself face the fear and after about 20 minutes you show yourself that it‚Äôs not in fact as overwhelming as you thought as long as you can make it through those 20 minutes. So I‚Äôve been setting my goal to focus on just getting through the first 20 and I feel so much better about it. 

You‚Äôre amazing for going to law school and I hope this helps!! Best of luck!"

AmItheAsshole,ex6l5ic,t3_cre4qy,1566047460.0,"NTA My mother would say that I looked like a lesbian with my hoop in? 1. What the fuck? 2. That‚Äôs not even an insult? lol having a hoop makes me look like I like women? Okay.

The point of this being she‚Äôs said a lot of things and I came to the breaking point about 2 years ago and I just stopped talking to her for a lot of reasons...this one being a small one in comparison to the other things. 

I finally proved my point and after almost a year of not speaking to her she finally realized how to treat me. She stopped all of her insulting and realized that it‚Äôs worth being kind if she wants a good relationship with me. 

Maybe it‚Äôs worth giving it a try? Sometimes standing up for yourself is exactly what you need to do to make people treat you the way you should be treated!"

AmItheAsshole,evn1an7,t3_ckdvux,1564616991.0,"NTA. when I was 16 I worked / saved money from previous birthdays so I could buy a car. Granted my dad was a mechanic so it made fixing up a beater easier but I managed a 1996 Malibu (this was 10 years ago). I paid $1200 and it was the best car ever. It lasted me years where I treasured it because it was MINE. Also it ended up with a few bumps and bruises as first cars do. 

Now I‚Äôm 26 and drive an 05 Malibu that I also bought for a few thousand dollars. We‚Äôre going on 5 years together.  I just don‚Äôt see the sense in buying a new car until I have a family and I‚Äôm established!"

My boyfriend has put in fences before. He works as a farm manger so he‚Äôs used to fence and posts. Our landlord just fixed this house.
