depression,eqhovft,t3_bycijd,1560066057.0,"I was the top of my class most of my entire elementary school life, very intelligent. But when my depression hit in my final year of highschool, I seemed to just get considerably ""dumber"". Since then, I've failed quite a number of uni subjects over the past few years. 
I know im still intelligent, but this doesnt make sense unless one acknowledges that mental illness, trauma, all these psychological issues are real issues and can be just as disabling as physical ailments. So take it easy on yourself. Practice activities that help you work on your memory, or mental agility, or problem solving skills, etc.  And take it one day at a time. Ive got Peak and Lumosity on my phone and they help me improve my mental performance. Reading and writing for leisure also helps. 

Anyway my point is you're not dumb and you havent lost the intelligence that others recognised in you when you were younger. And you can get back there, just work on it day by day and be patient with yourself."
MAFS_AU,epvv2i8,t3_bw8bb5,1559552784.0,"""After sleeping with a guy after one day i bet you have ------ relationships"". Im not sure.. it sounds like ""havent been in good relationships"" or ""alot of relationships"" im not sure though."
depression,epgduql,t1_epg7yii,1559211961.0,"You dont deserve it any less than anyone else who needed the help would. I know it's easier said that done, but try to be kinder to yourself. I understand not wanting to be a burden, but a true friend would WANT to be there for you. You can also message me if you ever need to. ‚ù§"
gatekeeping,epgdes1,t1_epgarf5,1559211774.0,"I do it the ""reverse"" way because [TMI] i like to wipe with the ""wrong"" side of the paper cus i dont want the soft fluffy bits from the ""proper side"" to get stuck in my bootyhole. I find that since the ""wrong"" side is a bit more abrasive, it does a better job of getting everything out and not leaving anything behind haha"
depression,epg6ts6,t3_buqryv,1559208581.0,"Deactivate social media for a while and use text/face-to-face to keep in touch with your close friends. If you want to leave the past behind that's a big step that can really help. 

That's what's been helping me lately"
depression,epg6j4l,t1_epg6azy,1559208430.0,Also i want to add: its ok to not be able to function by yourself right now. Mental illness takes a toll not just on your mind but your body. It's ok to need other people to get through.
depression,epg6azy,t3_buqz6o,1559208315.0,"Do you trust any of these friends to be able to tell them how youre feeling? You only have to share what you're comfortable with sharing with them. But maybe it's worth opening up to those close to you about how you really need their company.. 
Youve recognised that having someone around helps, i think it's worth asking your friends/family to be there for you."

BlackPeopleTwitter,epfbemn,t3_bum2o3,1559193706.0,"Australian here. TIL: Turns out in most Australian states you have to pay as well (and it can be up to hundreds of $). The exception is if you're a permanent res of the state of Queensland, then you get free ambulance rides regardless of where you are in the country. 

How bizarre."
WhitePeopleTwitter,eoynl9r,t1_eoyb4wr,1558943339.0,"Everytime I've marked an item as sent, it's then revealed a phone number amongs the buyer's other postage details.  Definitely not a code or anything like that. This is on the eBay app btw.
I've never  had to use the phone numbers cus i just send them messages via eBay but it's definitely there.

Just had a quick google and this link below pretty much says the same thing: after a transaction has been made, a seller can then access buyer's ph number. For me it's only become available after marking the item as 'Sent'.

WhitePeopleTwitter,eouizgy,t1_eoui8cl,1558869469.0,"Ebay-er here (mostly buyer, sometimes seller). Once you mark an item as ""Sent"" the Buyer's phone number becomes visible to the Seller.
It's possible he could have sent her a text or something after posting the items and that's how she got a hold of his number. 

I kinda see why you might think the story is fake though. I mean, i hope it's true but im getting some r/thathappened vibes..."
