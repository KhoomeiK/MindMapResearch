AskAcademia,foc6kyw,t1_foc1ya2,1587667702.0,"Hi - so it is actually very common for mental health professionals to encourage their patients to google/talk about their disorders and things like that. My therapist did it with me when she gave me the diagnosis and told me to tell her what I thought about it the following week. While I learned a lot from her I also learned much of what I know about bipolar from other people online who have it, as well as medical websites and such.

I think my point is that things like terminology and ""real mental disorders"" aren't only decided by researchers. The people who are experiencing the struggle themselves are going to know their mind and body the best, even if they don't know the nitty gritty details that come with vigorous research. Telling someone their disorder doesn't exist is incredibly invalidating and could possibly trigger their condition to be much worse - especially for people with mental disorders as self-validation is a skill many of these people lack. I know at my worst, if someone told me I was faking it, it would have felt like the end of the world and I might have had another suicide attempt.

For an anecdotal case, I was misdiagnosed several times before I finally received the diagnosis of bipolar. Even trained professionals who have been at it for decades don't always know best for a patient.

My other point would be, I don't think the specific label matters too much. DID is one illness out of many that can be treated in similar ways. There are some disorders that benefit more from certain treatments (BPD with DBT for example) but in general, therapy and medication are typically tailored to an individual's needs anyway and a large amount of mental health treatment is trial and error. Also, when things are comorbid, when you treat one illness sometimes the others are more manageable.

In short: mental health is very subjective, and I think trusting the experiences of people who have disorders is important. There is no reason for a perfectly healthy individual to fake having a bunch of comorbid illnesses so regardless of the specific label, it is clear they must be struggling in some way and go to therapy.

EDIT: mental health care is also very expensive, especially in the US, so they might not have the resources available to them to get a proper diagnosis!"
AskAcademia,foc3m53,t1_foby8re,1587666725.0,"That is very fair. I won't deny that I could be seeing this differently due to my own experiences. I picked some things out in that post however that seemed like red flags - mostly that OP thinks working 10 hours a day is ""normal"", so I'm not really sure how much the student is actually failing if expectations are already that high.

I initially wrote a much longer post out of frustration but I deleted a lot of it since I didn't want to make anyone read a novel - but part of it was that I acknowledged it is also the responsibility of the student to seek help and communicate their situation as best as they can. I wouldn't have made it through anything if I hadn't sought advice and taken it, you know? If this student is actually not putting anything into their degree then obtaining it through a free ride won't help them in any way - they need experience, skills, knowledge, etc. for jobs, and if they're not trying then it will show in interviews even if they did graduate.

So yes, I do think this person should be held accountable as well! I was just getting frustrated seeing all of these comments and remembering my experience. People are not their illness and sometimes need genuine help from others. I think it's normal and human to experience lows.

Thank you for the kind remarks. I really appreciate it."

AskAcademia,fobpcas,t1_fo9xx9t,1587662205.0,"Severe mental health issues and you can't even fathom how this person might be suffering?

I had two suicide attempts during undergrad and the time leading up to both attempts was filled with skipping classes to sleep (sleeping up to 16 hours a day), huge bouts of insomnia, didn't leave my room, barely kept up my hygiene, hours of crying spells or panic attacks or dissociation... lol if you think I'm gonna walk into class when I was in that state

I still graduated with honors and a lot of work/research experience under my belt, but only because a couple of my professors were extremely compassionate and listened to me and gave me advice. I sought therapy because of them and communicated my situation as best as I could, there were times I had to take incompletes or drop entire courses, but I still made it through because of these accommodations."
AskAcademia,fobodub,t1_fo9lsru,1587661914.0,It used to be called MPD. Some people still use the term. This entire comment is ableist. Why is this being upvoted?
AskAcademia,fobnd40,t1_foapl14,1587661601.0,"I mean to be completely honest the way OP is describing this person sounds just like my mentor from undergrad who decided she wouldn't be a reference for me for jobs despite my excellent performance in her class because of shit she heard passively from other professors a year or two later after I had been hospitalized twice for being suicidal and became really depressed lmao

People's perceptions of others can become really warped in situations like this, it's actually insane. My mentor literally teaches classes about women in science & read an entire book on this woman scientist living with bipolar disorder and then she turned around and was like ""I can't give you a good recommendation because of your attendance this year in other classes so ask someone else"" (I dropped the ones I was underperforming in too) and then ghosted me and didn't come see me graduate or anything lol, didn't even congratulate me on any of my achievements, just decided I wasn't a good student anymore. She kept trying to persuade me to drop one of my majors and do much less work and not attempt grad school and basically not have any ambitions because I was dealing with the worst of my bipolar disorder

Meanwhile I graduated with a 3.6 GPA and a double major after two suicide attempts, I won several awards for my research and landed a really prestigious job that will probably get me into a top grad school... whatever.

People go through things, I just think we should be more compassionate and work to live rather than live to work. Look at this pandemic, nobody is really working as hard as they normally would and everyone is more understanding, but that's because this is a disease threatening everyone instead of an individual."

internetparents,flx1lut,t1_flx15a7,1585572647.0,"My boyfriend also recently went to sleep. I got upset with him because I felt he wasn't concerned with me being stressed (we were in a phone call together, I cried and asked for support, and he told me he didn't know what he could say and it felt he just kind of ignored me). There's a lot more context to it but basically he got defensive when I was upset and it led to an argument. :( 

In retrospect I think I was just overwhelmed from my night terror & all this other stress, like the thought of having to clock in in 3 hours, so it seemed more serious to me at the time than it actually was. He listened to me the whole time even if he didn't say anything supportive directly and he also expressed later he was burnt out and tired and not in a good mood. I feel bad.

Boyfriend stuff aside, the entire lab is working from home as of last week. It's just, I feel I can't clock in because I don't know how long I could stay awake for, or how engaged I would be in reading the articles I need to read/solving chemistry problems.

I just really want to sleep but I don't know if I should wait for my boss to email me back. I know she will be accepting but I just have so much anxiety about everything right now it feels like one wrong move will uproot my entire life.

The person who made this comment is kinda correct. Considering up until this decade being trans was considered a mental illness, yes, mental illness is a social construct

Like in some Native American cultures hallucinations were welcomed and people tried to illicit them through different means, they were like spiritual journeys that made you wiser or warned you of things. Specific case: seeing Wendigos could have been a sign of schizophrenia, but wasn't seen as a 'disability' or 'mental illness' in that culture.

I think it would be more accurate to say that our classification and understanding of mental illnesses is a social construct though cuz you can't ignore the fact people are actually struggling & dysfunctional"
