OP, it is unfortunate what has happened but all of it is not your mistake. Yes you did wrong by sleeping with your brother's girlfriend but you have made stable life and family with her over a decade! 


I see a lot of immature people here. Esp your parents who seem to be easily swayed by any version of reality they're presented with. They know the series of events and should have taken measures to their best to reconcile the family instead of picking sides or being quiet for 10 years!


As for your brothers, there's a lot of ego and immaturity still involved. So it's not your fault entirely.


What you can do: No where did you mention that you apologised for the trouble you caused your family. So may be start there. It's an apology delayed by a decade but still may help. Come clean about your regrets, actions and that you want to reconcile, in your apology (written would work better) and leave it at that. Allow your family members time to think over and respond. It's upto them to decide whether they want to reconcile. If they do, that's great. If they don't, then you go back to the life you're anyway leading but with the knowledge that you tried everything in your power to make things right.


Hope this helps."

At this age, I have everything that I wanted when I was 25 but I now realise I want different things.


My point is, ask yourself what  'getting your life together' means to you? Coz what it means to you at 21 may not be the same when you're 25. And time changes you as a person as it goes by, believe me you'll never at any age feel that you have it all together :) That ideal of 'having it all together' doesn't exist and that's okay.

datingoverthirty,fpds3v2,t3_gcu9b4,1588533108.0,"From my (30F) experience, I have two things to share:

1. I have been in love with a guy who was not good looking, at all. But I was mad sexually attracted to him, he was funny, and I fell in love. All along I was aware that he wasn't good looking but it didn't matter to me.

2. I have dated a guy who I thought I loved and did not like the way he looked. Eventually I realised it was my lack of love that made him 'unattractive' to me, not his looks per se. 

What I'm saying is that how we perceive our partners looks is an expression of how we truly feel about them. If you say you love this guy but still find him unattractive, I'd say to not go ahead with the relationship because his poor looks will always be at the back of your head and will cause resentment in your behaviour towards him in the longer run."
