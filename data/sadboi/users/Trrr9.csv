But, I can see the vote count on this comment going down quickly and I just want to kindly explain why I think it might be ruffling some feathers. Saying ""try harder"" makes it sound as though those of us who are taking longer to become parents aren't trying hard enough. Or like if you just 'try harder' it can somehow magically change your biology. Even though I really don't think that was your intent. I think a phrase like ""waiting a little longer"" would get a better response from this sub.

Kind of an aside, but we're not all going through the same emotional turmoil. Its worth recognizing that we're all in different situations and we all feel and experience things differently. I think its a two way street. Those starting out can absolutely post about how happy and excited they are or how much they are struggling emotionally, even though those types of comments are sometimes difficult for me to read. Those of us who have been at this for a while should be allowed to express our unique frustrations and emotions without being judged as well, as long as it is not at the expense of others.

All I know is that every cycle my heart breaks when the tests come back negative. And every day I imagine what life would be like with a little one. I love daydreaming about it.

TryingForABaby,fqngb8f,t3_gjw4c7,1589494334.0,"Check out the sub info page, there's a ton of good information about OPK testing on there. 

If its your first cycle using the OPKs, I would recommend starting once a day on roughly cycle day 8. Then increasing to twice a day around cycle day 12. The average peak is around cycle day 14, but everyone is different. (For reference, cycle day 1 is the first day of your period.)

Fwiw, I almost always have at least a faint line, so I'm not surprised that you are seeing something, even though it is likely you've already ovulated this cycle if your period is due in 9 days. 

Again, every one is different, but hopefully this helps. Maybe check out the Sperm Meets Egg Plan as a helpful guideline as well. Also, the PreMom app has a cool feature where you can take a photo of the OPK test strip and it will give you a numeric value as a result. I find this makes the tests much easier to read and track.

It just makes me happy to see people trying and working with their dog's reactivity instead of ignoring it or pretending its acceptable."
reactivedogs,flvs054,t3_frgulo,1585530735.0,"Same! Our forest preserve has definitely been busier than usual, but most of our interactions have been positive. Lots of parents telling kids not to pet our dogs without asking. My favorite was ""we don't go up to strange doggies, but we can wave hello at them from here!"" 

We've also seen A LOT of people pull their reacting/staring/barking dogs off the path, put them in a sit and try to maintain focus when they see us coming. It makes me so happy. I've even seen a couple of muzzled dogs (which is a great option if you don't trust your dog not to bite!) We calmly* walk by and I always try to be super positive and friendly when I see these things because I know exactly how stressful it is and how judged you can sometimes feel for not having a chill dog. I see you guys out there and I'm proud of your efforts! 

(*after years of training we can finally walk on busy paths without either of our dogs going bonkers. Keep up the training everyone, there's a light at the end of the tunnel!)"
reactivedogs,flvgexf,t3_fqyf1h,1585523256.0,"Great list! Hopefully it helps.

I just want to note that for us reactive dog owners, we should also try be a little extra understanding of the fact that a lot of the people really just have no clue. I've been seeing a lot of small dogs in particular who have probably never really been on a leash before, let alone a walk in the woods before. There's a bit of a learning curve. So as frustrating as some of their behaviors are for us, it's good to keep in mind they are likely new to this and are probably acting out of ignorance, not malice. Still super annoying, but getting argumentative with them off the bat probably won't help. 

Also, we should be extra supportive of *each other* during these times, too. It's tough with all the extra walkers right now. Say thank you when someone goes out of their way to respect your space. If you do see someone working/training with their dog, give them a smile and tell them to keep up the good work. If they're struggling, maybe give them some friendly (but not intrusive) encouragement as you pass. A little kindness and solidarity can go a long way."

TryingForABaby,fl88p8q,t1_fl82orw,1584918225.0,"In our society, for some reason, it is much easier and less embarrassing to say that you hadn't been trying a long time than to 'admit' that it took a while, so people are more comfortable sharing that experience. Building off of your wedding example, people getting married aren't bragging. But getting married before a certain age is seen as a positive and being single is seen as a negative. That's one of the reasons why couples who get married later tend to have smaller/more simple weddings.  

I felt the same way when I started out. That these subs are intimidating and I didn't really belong. Or that I had to apologize for ""only"" trying for a few cycles. Now, I try to make a point to support the women just starting out because those are scary and confusing times too. We're all in this together and we should be here to support each other, it isn't a competition. Jealousy is a natural emotion. It's ok for those of us who have been trying a long time to be fiercely jealous of the unicorns. Its *not* ok for us to be mean/rude to them."

Even if you're just starting to try, its stressful and scary and no one needs the extra pressure. Lauren just waited 8 months to even start trying, so I'd guess she was already anxious about it all. 

Also, Deena saying ""oh let's get our babies together so Mike and Lauren can play with them!"" Maybe they are cool with it, but being around other babies can be really hard when you're desperate for your own.
