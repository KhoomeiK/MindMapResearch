CentrelinkOz,fo61gyq,t1_fnyusav,1587542973.0,How long did it take to have your claim reassessed? Mine was rejected and I visited a service centre and we put in an application to have it reassessed.
CentrelinkOz,fnyt3qp,t3_g26tz9,1587374641.0,Hey I'm in the same position...does anyone know what follows? Does it mean my claim has been rejected?
depression,fiq35i8,t1_fiq2yyc,1582633551.0,"It sounds like she may be dealing with some things herself if she flips between good and toxic, but know you can find someone that's good and good...I personally feel like I've reached a stage where I refuse to let anything/anyone toxic come into my life because of how sensitive I am. While a normal person might be able to deal with a toxic side to someone, I'm way too sensitive for that and easily manipulated. It's good to just steer clear of all toxicity no matter how good the good is..."
depression,fiq2xvb,t1_fiq2iun,1582633343.0,"I feel you, I hear you, and I have hope for you :)"
depression,fiq1grb,t3_f98ac4,1582631767.0,I think people who invalidate your feelings or turn something about you into something about them are toxic to be around...I think you made a good decision
depression,fiq1c8f,t1_fiq155o,1582631622.0,"From my experience, I too lost myself when I came depressed. I felt like I didn't know who I was, what I was doing...I felt like I had lost my sense of humour and personality, I was just exisiting...that's depression for you :/ A common sympton is losing interest in things which once gave you joy, I guess that could include sex and your sexuality?"
depression,fiq14m6,t3_f98j96,1582631373.0,Yay I'm so happy for you! May I ask how you did it?
depression,fiq10ce,t3_f98q28,1582631230.0,"Antidepressants caused me to loose my libido as well, don't worry, it's a common but unfortunate side effect :(

I do have a positive story though! I tried a course of TMS (transcranial magnegic stimulation) which allowed me to come off my antidepressants and trust me, your libido returns haha all in good time. I hope you can take some comfort in knowing that it can and does come back, it's just the medication :/"
AusLegal,fhzo0x6,t1_fhziyp2,1582005192.0,"That's called being polite; ""Come back in two weeks."" = telling someone what to do VS ""Are you able to come back in two weeks?"" = asking. Being polite is everything when it comes to business so I'm not suprised. Don't get hung up on wording just because you interpreted it incorrectly. 

Animal health is very different to human health and we often improvise. Two popsicle sticks are lightweight, straight, and a good length for the cats legs...so that sounds like a great alternative to me. Maybe the vet had a bad experience using a splint, maybe he's been improvising since before they were invented, but I can tell you he did the best he could at the time. I doubt the sticks themselves caused the healing time to increase...it sounds like someone didn't follow the strict crate instructions.

I'm suprised that your cat showed no signs of being uncomfortable despite what you described as a very uncomfortable situation underneath the bandage. Maybe you didn't pay attention to your cats signs because you had all of those other animals to look after."
AusLegal,fhyvebc,t3_f566cd,1581984632.0,"The vet asked you to come back for a revisit in 2 weeks and you said you couldn't...that's going against veterinary advice. There are no buts, you simply didn't follow veterinary advice. When we have difficult clients who are unable to come in for check-ups, we just have to remain calm and offer an alternative, that doesn't mean that we agree with the alternative, we can only make a suggestion and hope the healing goes as planned.

It sounds like you would have given every excuse over the moon as to why you couldn't come in for that check up, and at the end of the day how we are supposed to respond to that? We can't force you into agreeing to come, we can explain the importance calmly and leave it at that. The poor vet probably didn't want to come across as aggressive and loose his job. Maybe consider that you might be a difficult client? 

The veterinary board will probably look at the history provided by the clinic and see ""refused to come in for the check up against veterinary advice due to living so far away"". Be careful because from my perspective, and I work in the industry, it doesn't sound like we are in the wrong."
depression,fh6xx2n,t3_f1djgl,1581308945.0,Yeah unfortunately emotions love themselves and feed on each other...so saddness feeds on saddness to create a cycle of sadness. You have to try and break the cycle by doing opposite action! #dbt
depression,fggxuvl,t3_eyb86p,1580772009.0,"I started smoking weed daily for months and it actually stopped my antidepressants from working which then caused a downwards spiral...I was admitted to hospital and became clean and my medication started to work again and the depression lifted. The worst part is is that you keep chasing the same high but it's never as good and then you move onto the next more dangerous drug (I did at least). Weed pauses all of your problems temporarily but it will create a much larger one long term, because with a high comes a low and that low can be 10 times worse.

Stay safe guys and try to use it in moderation üëå"

He's definitely not relationship material.
