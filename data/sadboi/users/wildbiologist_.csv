There are a few positions I’ve seen that take people with 0 experience but they’re probably minimum wage. If you’re not able to volunteer then look more into conservation and the non profit world.

I'm always surprised though that I've never worked with another vegan wildlife biologist when we all love animals and care about the environment. I found that Bolivia was surprisingly easy - as my field site was all vegetarian to begin with since meat was so expensive and more of a luxury there. Lots of beans, yucca, potatoes, rice. The hardest was probably northern Canada, because I am normally housed in oil and gas work camps with cooks and some of them have never even met a vegetarian and don't understand what vegan was.

Then I finally got a full-time, permanent wildlife biologist job.

But personally I don't hunt and I don't take jobs where I work that closely with hunters because I feel like my personal morals intersect too much with professional responsibilities, and there are other wildlife biologists more suited to that realm. 

To your second question, I had quite a bit of wilderness/outdoor experience. I grew up in a very rural area on a large property and was always backpacking and camping for extended periods of time as a kid. I think that without that exposure to nature as a kid I wouldn't do what I do now."

But the short answer is basically I have a bachelors degree in ecology/animal behaviour and years and years of internship, volunteer, and work experience slowly building up to the types of jobs I have now. Masters and PhDs are also standard for most jobs. This field relies a TON on who you know and putting yourself out there to grab opportunities when they come up. You have to be really flexible and competitive to succeed in this field.

I have made as little as nothing (volunteer for free in exchange for food/housing) and as much as $250,000 (oil & gas work). Now I make around $60,000 which is probably a bit more than standard."
IAmA,f1xsbv2,t1_f1xr0pj,1569803255.0,Yep! Not for work but I backpacked through Ecuador for a few weeks.
IAmA,f1xqu2c,t1_f1xps25,1569802625.0,"I'm an animal lover! And since I'm not a carnivore, I feel better on a vegan diet than a wolf would. ;)"
IAmA,f1xqn64,t1_f1xpf1w,1569802505.0,"I studied ecology in school and got an internship in studying urban wildlife, and went from there! I did seasonal jobs for awhile all around the world, then worked up in northern Canada for awhile. And yes - it's the ""if it doesn't scan, is it free?"" version of being a wildlife biologist - I have heard just about every cougar joke!"
IAmA,f1xqfw2,t1_f1xo75j,1569802381.0,"Bobcats are nothing to worry about as they don't pose a risk to humans, except in extremely rare situations. Cougars are more of a problem. When you see them near human areas, they could just have been lost or maybe are wandering through a new housing development that used to be a part of their territory - that's less worrisome. Or they could be ""problem cougars"" - meaning they are losing their fear of humans and are preying on pets in backyards or even humans themselves. While this is rare, it's something wildlife agencies are on the lookout for. If a problem cougar hurts a human or biologists believe is likely too, it will probably be captured and euthanized. Keep in mind though that MANY cougar sightings are incorrectly identified house cats or bobcats. Ive even heard a figure of up to 90% of cougar sightings are false."
IAmA,f1xpz3d,t1_f1xoxwc,1569802191.0,"I think the most unstable place I worked was Bolivia, which wasn't that bad. There were known poachers around our field site and we would see the bodies of wildlife that were killed by poachers since they would leave the less ideal parts they couldn't sell. We also got a lot of protests near us that would shut down the road to camp so sometimes we had no supplies for a few days."
IAmA,f1xprzk,t1_f1xog5i,1569802090.0,"Nope! They were known to be in the area so I expected them. Wolf attacks are incredibly rare and they had no reason to mess with me. I think they were less ""following"" me and more so walking down the beach behind me as it was the easiest route to travel down."
IAmA,f1xpkd4,t1_f1xn6qw,1569801987.0,"The idea of an ""alpha wolf"" is not totally false, but most of this information comes out of studying captive wolves, which do exhibit behaviours where one or two wolves (alpha male/alpha female) do show dominant behaviours over other members of their group. Most researchers that study wild wolves have dismissed the traditional alpha wolf idea, but wolves do have really interesting social dynamics.

IAmA,f1xognq,t1_f1xo49t,1569801475.0,"It's a great job for me, but it's highly competitive and I did a lot of really crappy jobs before I got to this point. It also is tough because it can be days and days on end of trudging through a swamp getting attacked by mosquitos - those are the days I question my career field."
IAmA,f1xoav2,t1_f1xnqzz,1569801398.0,"1. I would have to say the Amazon! I worked with a sanctuary down there and it was incredibly beautiful. 
2. For wild animals, I would say a wolf pack that followed me when I was walking down the beach. I have worked with both animals in captivity though but I think that's cheating! 
3. Arctic wolf I would say, they're incredibly striking. And super resourceful."
IAmA,f1xo256,t1_f1xndhw,1569801305.0,Cougar! They typically go for the neck and kill you before you even knew what was coming. Wolves would likely latch onto your bum and take you down that way. Wolves seem to mess around with you a bit more before you actually end up dying - but you would think the opposite if you ever watch a domestic house cat play with their food...
IAmA,f1xnthy,t1_f1xn74q,1569801200.0,"Like 75% of the time during ""field season"" which is March-September for me, and rarely during winter - more like 10% of the time. My trips are usually anywhere from 3 days - 3 weeks depending on the amount of work we have to do or area we have to cover. We usually are housed in remote field camps where there is food available or at a town with a grocery store so we can cook for ourselves."
