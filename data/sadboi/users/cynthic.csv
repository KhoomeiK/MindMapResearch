Newer riders should understand that there isn’t a lot of room for mistakes on those types of bikes. It’s unfortunate that you had to witness an accident at your msf course. When I was waiting for my class to start, the class before us had a near accident. A guy understeered and almost crashed into a pole going around 15mph.

For the newer riders that might be lurking on this thread and claim that they’ll be “responsible”. It is possible to learn on a 600, it is possible to learn how to take corners and master the fundamentals. But there is very little room for error. If or when you master or get the hang of the fundamentals. When you start to ride in the hills or take track days. Learning how to corner on those type of bikes will be a whole lot harder than learning on a 500 or lower displacement. It’ll be uncomfortable because you’ll be managing that power. You’ll see success stories of riders on this subreddit or the calamari subreddit of people learning on 600s, but those success stories aren’t you.

In terms of bikes, I’m 5’4 and tip toe every bike that I’ve sat or ridden on. Except for the rebel 300. Since you’re 4 inches shorter than I am, then you may or may not tip toe. There’s a ton of bikes that you can still look at, from sports bikes like the ninja 250/300, cbr250r or 300r, r3, and gsxr 250. You’ll want to use lowering links to shorten the seat height for some of the bikes, and maybe a shaved or aftermarket seat. Since I still tip toe on the r3 and ninja 300, but not by a lot. If you’re looking at bakers then there is the, z300, cb300f/r and the mt-03, but the mt-03 just came into the market so there isn’t much of a used market for it.

To be honest though, you don’t necessarily need to be flat footed to learn how to ride a motorcycle. But being flat footed definitely helps with learning, makes you feel more stable, and you can manage the weight better than tip toeing a bike. 

I don’t have a car, and only use a bicycle and a motorcycle to commute. Once when you take a course, get your motorcycle and permit. Riding a motorcycle just feels like a more stable bicycle once you get the hang of it. The Canadian courses should just be like the American courses so they’ll teach you about the friction zone of the clutch, throttle control, counter steering, etc."

Sure, some people can manage all of that power, but they won’t be able to learn the same on a 600 compared to a 300. 

I’m probably going to get some flak for this, but I partially blame American motorcycle culture. There’s this unnecessary need for speed and power, and bikes under 600-650cc are usually casted out and seen as only beginner bikes. When I first started to get into riding, a lot of the people who I talked to were telling me to get a 500 or a 650 so I can grow into it. However, my friends who were riding for 5-6 years at the time told me to get a 250 or 300. I’m grateful for taking that advice, and starting on a 250.

I said some similar things about my dad to my mom before I finally moved out.

He was emotionally abusive and manipulative, and his family thought that I was just a burden on him since I wasn’t going to school or working. Clinical depression to the point of it being debilitating is not fun. One of his other sons told my mom that she should’ve never gotten together with my dad, that she was just mooching off of him, and that I should’ve never been born. That wasn’t the case, they were mooching off of her, she sent thousands of dollars in actual money and items just to help them live.

I was receiving calls from a clinic or a hospital and they were asking about my dad (I’m going to call him John, you’ll later find out as to why). I cut ties with him a while back, so I wasn’t too fond of these calls. 
Anyways, I called the office and the nurse who answered the phone wanted to make sure that I was his son by asking what his birth date was. I told her that I didn’t know, and she responded with “How do you not know John’s birthday?” in a tone that makes you feel bad.

As to why I called him John. I hate my dad, and I barely know the guy. I lived with him until I was 20 years old, but we never had any actual conversations. It was a highly dysfunctional family with the usual “petty fights turn into full blown arguments”, the blame game, and just a bunch of other things. So calling him dad or even saying his real name agitates me a lot. 

In the end, I couldn’t blame the nurse for asking that question. I told her that I actually barely know him and that I haven’t talked to him in a year. She apologized, and by the tone of her voice she was embarrassed. We usually expect people to have functional families and not have issues, so the question about not knowing John’s birthday was understandable.

The second one is being asked “why don’t you like smoking weed or drink alcohol anymore?” with an emoji next to it by some match on tinder. I straight up told her that I started smoking and drinking when I was 13, and that the next time she matches with some one on tinder who doesn’t like smoking or drinking.

It can be a good starter bike, since there is a small debate about it being a mid-high level beginner or it being an intermediate bike. The reason why I suggest the cbr650r is due to it being an inline-4. It’s not tuned to have the same power as a 600cc, but you’ll still have that inline-4 torque.

There is also the 500cc bikes like the ninja or cbr500 which are also good beginner bikes as well, and the other 650cc bikes like the sv650 and the ninja 650.

However, I may be suggesting these bikes, but if you really want to learn how to ride hard in the future. I say something like a ninja 400 or an r3 are great starter bikes to really learn how to take corners. Since the busa is a liter bike, and it’s one of the more heavy/bulky ones around.

I do think VR games in the future will desensitize people to war, especially since FPS games are aiming for more realistic graphics. 

People are already being desensitized to videos like these due to watch people die (I was part of that demographic) before it was banned, and these war videos became a common occurrence to watch. Ever since the sub was banned, these hit pretty hard again."
SuggestAMotorcycle,fmq780q,t1_fmpov7h,1586294166.0,"I have to agree with your statement about men wanting to prove people wrong. I have to admit the states do have this issue where “more power is better, anything else is for wussies” type of ideology. When I first started to ride which was a long while back. I actually wanted to start off on a 650cc which can be manageable for beginners, but I bought a 250cc instead because my friends who’ve been riding for 6 years recommended it. I’m not the type to be arrogant and do things my way so I took their advice, and stayed humble.

Learning on the 250cc was the best decision that I made. I basically learned everything with ease, from my corners, to trail braking, to my throttle control, and etc. I was able to max out my 250cc in the corners in a 6 month span of time. Imagine trying to max out a 600cc within that time frame, is not impossible for some people, but it certainly is more difficult than what beginners like to think.

Not to say that everyone needs to learn on a 250cc, 300cc, or 400cc, but they’re so much more forgiving than starting off on 650’s or 600’s."

Life is rough, and I’m 22 now, been clean from everything but alcohol since high school ended which is going to be 5 years in a few months. I’ve been clean from alcohol for 4-5 months now, but I’ve been tempted to start drinking again. 

Since everything is shut down, my job that I was actually supposed to start a few weeks ago is closed until the end of may, and it’s pretty much hard to go back to school, especially since I fucked myself over last semester by dropping out without leaving my classes. I don’t have access to Fafsa or other grants, so I’ve put myself in a very awful situation. I can’t commit suicide since I’m the type that needs to get rid of every thing physical since I rent a room with a few folks, it’s getting harder and harder to (in a sense) stay sane. I told my house mate who I’m close with about my depression and that I might have admit myself into the ER last night just to get anti-depressants (I really hate the American health care system), and I talked to a friend who currently lives in Arizona. Things have calmed down for me, but it’s getting tougher and tougher as the days pass by.

Sure, you have people who grew up around gangs and love that feeling of power that they give (grew up with those kids too for a bit), but for other people, they just want to get away from the gang violence, but the gang violence catches up to them.

People will be surprised at how young kids will associate themselves with gang members, and how they want to be part of that lifestyle at such an early age."

I can’t do siege attacks with my lord due to it crashing each and every time, the battles are few since the map is larger than before, and the notifications aren’t as good as warband (at the moment). I’ve hit a glitch with a main mission quest line where I finally killed those damn forsaken forest bandits and drank from their skull, but it didn’t give me the quest item so it put me back on an older save by a few hours. 

So I just created a new character due to that main mission bug, which I don’t mind since I always had multiple play throughs in Warband, but in its current state. I’ll have to put the game down for a few weeks for things to become a little more stable.

It’s great that the game has had a huge launch, but I do wish that they held off on early access, at least just for a few more months just to get more stability and performance issues in check.

depression,flib16v,t3_fotwll,1585178821.0,"One thing that I believe in when someone commits suicide and their family and friends are left behind. Is that they shouldn’t be angry, they shouldn’t call them weak. Yes, it’s painful to have lost someone but they wouldn’t want you to be sad forever. They should give thanks and celebrate the life that they lived with you, even when they couldn’t see that light or purpose to their life through their agony. They still thought about you until the end, they didn’t want to hurt you, but they themselves couldn’t stand their life anymore.

I’m still suicidal and it’s reached a peak where it’s constantly on my mind. If I ever do commit it, or whenever I decide to do it. I want the few friends who are still in my life to celebrate the life that I lived, remember the memories and the times that we had. It’ll be hard, no one likes death, but it’s better to forgive and cherish the memories, than resent and hate a person for committing suicide. Life is long, and yet it’s short. For one person, living these past few months feel like years, and for others it feels like a few weeks. We all have our lives to live out, and for many it’s a struggle and it’s hard. 

The people who consider people “weak” aren’t understanding the pain, aren’t understanding the mental fatigue that one may face. Which is saddening, they themselves are selfish for wanting them to hold on. Which I don’t find a problem with that. What I do have a problem with, are those that hold resentment and continue to hold resentment. The ones left behind aren’t the only victims, the ones that have committed suicide are victims as well."

Not all the troublemakers come from Oakland, and there troublemakers that come Alameda. So maybe it was an Alameda kid and not someone from Oakland.

Getting back on track to motorcycling and traffic. I’m not saying that it’s safe to 65mph on a motorcycle. The only people that go 65 are people on the very right lane, but that’s a car in between a ton of others going 70-75. However, I do notice that people will speed up to 85-100mph once they pass a car to get ahead. I’ve had a few close calls where I pass a car myself, it’s clear to my left or right and I merge to which ever lane I’m going onto, then out of no where someone is directly behind me at 80-100mph right on my rear wheel. I’ve had close calls like that, not due to my own blindness, but other drivers.

Edit: We Bay Area drivers know that people don’t go 5-10mph over the speed limit, they go 15-40 and as much as I tried to become a safer and defensive rider (I still am), I’ve also become a more aggressive rider due to how bad traffic is in the bay."

This is the type of shit that I hate. I used to love hooning and that squid life style in my first few years of high school, but over time I grew the fuck up. People can play the “I know what I’m doing” or “It’s my life and I’ll have fun with it. You guys can live boring lives” bullshit, but they don’t even think about the consequences. The consequences of hurting yourself, your family, bystanders, the witnesses, and even first responders. 

I saw a motorcyclist on the San Mateo bridge one time riding on the emergency lane due to heavily congested traffic. He was speeding 40+ the rate of traffic, then proceeded to swerve in and out of traffic like a maniac. It killed my whole mood after witnessing that, and I’m a fellow rider. I like to ride spiritedly in the hills, I like to have my fun, but there are times when it’s not appropriate and you need to ride safe. Heavily congested traffic is one of those situations. None of us like traffic, and I’m grateful that California is a state that allows lane splitting. As much time that it cuts off my commute, I find it to be one of the most stressful and most dangerous situations to ride in.

Please stay safe out there fellow riders, and for new riders or people that want to start riding. Please don’t act like your bulletproof and be selfish.

depression,fletbcc,t3_fo6y02,1585091113.0,"I understand how you feel to an extent. I have my life figured out, but I don’t have the energy to pursue it. Everything in my life never falls through and struggling alone without much help is tiresome. One of my good friends just moved to Ohio for his nursing job. He pretty much has life in the bag right now, moved in with his gf, got his first actual job to kick off his career, and has a loving family. Sometimes I get jealous about his life, but I don’t hate talking to them about it. I do get depressed that nothing has ever lined up like his and many of the other people that I know, but I don’t hate it anymore.

I grew up hating everything that happened in my life, hating that my mom left when I was young, hating my father with a passion, hating that I can’t hold onto friendships or relationships, hating all of the mistakes that I’ve made. Ultimately in the end, I stopped giving in to most of the hate. I still hate myself for certain things, and I feel like this is the life that I deserve. I’m still extremely suicidal, and I just cut ties with that good friend of mine and a few others because I honestly think that they’re better off without me. I can’t move forward just like you, however, that isn’t the right decision. Right after I sent a text to him apologizing that I’m cutting ties with him, and that I don’t feel like a good friend, that I feel like I can’t be fully there for them emotionally in my current state. He replied back saying that he loves me and that he still wants to be there for me, same goes for some others. To be honest, I’m still going to cut ties at least just for a little bit and see where these next few months will take me. Whether I commit suicide, or if I can grow into that person that I’ve always tried hard to become. That’s one major reason why I cut ties, it already hurts them by cutting ties, but it’ll hurt even more if I commit suicide.

If your friends are truly understanding, then talk it out with them if you haven’t yet, be honest about your feelings and how you feel like you can’t grow, how you feel like you’re trapped 15 years behind them. I still feel like I’m in high school, and nothing has changed, but you don’t have to feel the same way. I’ve self sabotaged my whole life, and I don’t know what you’ve gone through, but you don’t have to continue the path down self sabotage. Learn to forgive yourself even if it’s very slowly. I honestly can’t give you good advice, since I’m still struggling and will continue to struggle for a very long time, but every day will be a new day to fight that bitter feeling of jealousy, another day to open up how you feel, and possibly get that support that you need. You feel like you can’t grow and feel 15 years behind, and as I said before, if your friends are truly understanding and care for you then they can help you grow, they can help you get past that feeling of being left behind. We all go through life at different paces, and as much as it sucks to hear and as much as I used to hate it. Life isn’t fair for everyone and it goes at a faster pace than others. I’m one of the unlucky ones, and that’s just the reality of life, but that doesn’t mean that you’re bound by this chain of fate or destiny that this is what your life will amount to. But you have to let go of the bitterness, you have to let go of the hate. It’s easier said than done, but I find that to be the truth. The more you self sabotage, the more bitterness and jealousy that you hold, the more hate that you have that your life hasn’t turned out the way you had hoped that it should’ve turned out, the more you can’t grow, the more you feel trapped and left behind. It digs itself until you can’t dig your way out.

I hope that you can dig your way out, and find that path of life that you want to walk on."
