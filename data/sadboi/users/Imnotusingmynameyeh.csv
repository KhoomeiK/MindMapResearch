depression,fmj77yn,t1_fmj5y04,1586124436.0,"Aww thx, u too"
abusiveparents,fmhak3l,t3_ftwfmk,1586072461.0,"Neither does my dad. He’ll come into my room and just purposely try to tick me off, or if he’s having one of his “bad days” he’ll just start screaming and sometimes physical. Worst of it after everything’s done he just forgets about it and pretends like nothing happened. One time he hit my mom till she was covered in bruises and everyone went to sleep, and the next morning he was just talking to her like nothing happened. We’re all scared to ask for an apology, and it pisses me off so badly that he can’t even bother to say sorry."
SuicideWatch,fmh5gyt,t3_fv7qnu,1586067380.0,"Please don’t, we’re all here 4 u. Sure most of us are probably strangers but we care about you. Remember there are always resources for you, different ways of coping, and things WILL get better(you’ve probably heard people say it on the internet and just said nahhh but trust me) If u need anyone to talk I’m here, and I’m sure tons of other people are too."
depression,fmgijtn,t3_fv35t2,1586049864.0,"I also relate to feeling like a burden. Sometimes when I’m lying on the bathroom floor, I’ll hear my parents screaming through the vents. And literally every single time it’s about me. My mom always says she would divorce my dad if I wasn’t here and that’s just makes me feel worse. It feels so much better now that I got it out."
depression_help,fmfwmqn,t1_fmfwduy,1586036385.0,I hope that too. I love how you can remain anonymous so you don’t feel as scared.
depression_help,fmfvc6d,t3_fv0shu,1586035607.0,"I can relate, and I know how hard it is to believe that others are actually going through the same thing. I pulled an all nighter last night thinking about every text I’ve sent to my friends that day. People always tell me that probably no one even cares about that text, but that just annoys me even more.
I get what it’s like, and overthinking sucks. But remember that there are people who can help and resources as available. And remember there are always people there 4 u even if they’re just strangers over the internet :)"
Anxiety,fme26ak,t3_frslfn,1585986279.0,Yeah. You say one thing and then at night i spend literally hours lying awake thinking about all the other responses I could have said.
fuckeatingdisorders,fme1s57,t3_fsrnxe,1585985838.0,"I just get myself one donut and head upstairs or store the rest somewhere pretty inconvenient, so when I’m done eating I’ll be too lazy to go get another one."
fuckeatingdisorders,fme1n66,t3_ftvvfk,1585985685.0,"Anyone else have grandparents who think the thicker u are the better? Cause whenever they point out that and compare to me to my cousin and tell her to eat more, I just feel like they’re just body shaming me even though they just have different beauty standards."
fuckeatingdisorders,fme1jpn,t1_fme10ns,1585985576.0,Aww You can do this I believe in u
fuckeatingdisorders,fme0v9y,t3_fup2hv,1585984818.0,"I always feel like I’m being judged every moment of my life, like all the eyes are on me. How I don’t have a thigh gap, or my stomach bulges out.
It is really hard to actually find self acceptance in a world where all the magazines are covered with skinny girls. Remember probably no one is judging, and everyone is beautiful. Screw size 0 clothing, I’ll be perfectly fine with the size that fits me :)"
SuicideWatch,fme0ble,t3_fuonya,1585984217.0,"Hi
My parents are immigrants too, and they always complain to me about how they moved so I could have a better future. So they force me to get good grades but nothing seems good enough for them.
Ur not alone and you’ve probably heard this before, but depression doesn’t need a reason 
I find ways to blame it on other people, convince myself my life is horrible just so I have a reason to be sad, but I guess there really isn’t a reason for me either"
depressed,fmdz5hi,t3_fukuhe,1585982960.0,"Yup, especially when your brains thinking about all the things you still have to do, and that just makes you so much more stressed out."
