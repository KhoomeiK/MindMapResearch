JUSTNOMIL,ff7cej4,t1_ff7b6a2,1579646287.0,"She is and isn’t? If that makes sense. 

I live with my SO and his parents while we save to move out, cause once again after a huge fight with her she kicked me out. My Dad lives down South in my hometown. At this point the only things she has control over are the things listed in the post, she also has my birth certificate. 

I’m not sure if these threats are legit since she’s done stuff like this before and didn’t follow through but I’m to the point where I’m just going to start taking steps to do these things anyway. Anything to not be tied to her anymore."
bipolar,feon7oo,t1_fensppy,1579302537.0,"He was actually one of the first people to suggest I had bipolar disorder, so I think he had an idea already why this was happening. He majored in psych and wanted to be a therapist and also struggles with severe depression so we’ve always leaned on each other to talk about these issues. 

Now we’re both in relationships and while we don’t rely on each other anymore we both understand that if things get really bad we’re still there for each other."
JUSTNOMIL,fehttbn,t1_fehrjm0,1579123732.0,"This is a usual behavior for him, I often call him the “mediator” cause any time she and I get into fights he’s often there to sit in the room and listen and doesn’t really say anything unless the fight gets really bad. 

She and I have also gone to family therapy to attempt to fix this but even then I mentioned how any time we have a serious conversation someone needs to mediate the conversation. 

In general i try to be open and honest and talk about what’s wrong but often times when I talk to my mother I feel like there’s this wall that’s put between us even if I tell her EVERYTHING that’s going on in my life... there’s just a wall."

That was before I didn’t sleep for 3 days and started seeing “the shadow people” and then wandered from one guys house to the next (during a time in which I was having very dangerous sex with people I didn’t know) I ended up at my Ex’s house crying outside about something before considering breaking into his house so that he could help me. 

Luckily my ex didn’t call the cops and after being diagnosed and explaining to him what happened were still friends to this day.

It's nice hearing that it's possible to find something even with the 2 years as long as I keep motivated and keep learning even outside of school. 

I've done one internship that wasn't at all what I was expecting, instead of doing any graphic design they had me doing literal packaging and binding which was a good experience to know the end result but I didn't learn much in actual design."
relationships,f6v8az5,t1_f6v3yeq,1573179252.0,"I 100% agree with those who struggle will always help others who struggle. With my parents it’s like night and day. My mom and I have a strained relationship due to our extreme differences, she likes expensive vacations, things, doesn’t like physically doing things and is willing to pay top dollar for anybody to do things for her. While I would rather fix/do things on my own and learn even if the outcome isn’t perfect, want to go outside and explore nature, and would rather save my money than spend it on stupid shit. She’s bored as a house wife and therefore spends all her money. 

My Dad? Complete opposite, we’re very very very close even though I live halfway across the country. We call/text everyday and make it a point to visit each other every 6ish months. He enjoys being outdoors, learning, gardening, and just generally having fun! He doesn’t make a lot of money but will always help me out when I need it. I can tell him anything and he’ll never judge me and he’ll always be there for me. But if you ask my mother about him, she’ll make him out to be a terrible father who only did the bare minimum.. 

She is also an extremely jealous woman.. she gets upset about me being close to my dad, my BF’s family, and anyone else but her. 

I make the effort to see her at least once every 2 weeks just so that it makes me feel less guilty but not talking to her. But it’s always fake or smalltalk."

My mother is just a housewife with 4 untrained dogs) 

When I try to vent to them about hardly being able to make college payments and being able to afford eating/gas/anything else in life they simply brush it off to talk about what stupid expensive thing they're doing next. Like the roaring 20's party they're about to have.. For 40 people they're hiring 2 dance instructors, a strolling singer (whatever that means), a poker player, and a roulette player. Not to mention the decorations.

bipolar,f2fg872,t3_dd9d1u,1570217192.0,"I’ve had good experiences with it but it seems like the comments are very mixed. Depending on the person it can help or hurt. 

But personally it helps me a lot but when it comes to my cannabis consumption I have these weird rules about it. 

First of all I’m taking my meds everyday and will never stop. 

Only indica, never sativa. I live in a legal state so I always know what I’m getting. Indica will calm me down and de tense me in an instant. I’ll only smoke to “calm” my brain and not to feel super stoned unless I’m at a party where I’ll smoke a lot instead of drinking. 

My boyfriends view of cannabis has changed dramatically due to how well it works for me. He used to believe medical weed was a joke but now during days where I’m hypomanic and can’t make a decision he’ll suggest smoking and sadly it works every time (I’ve always had mixed feelings about this but at this point I’ve accepted that it works for me) The mood change is night and day, from erratic and angry to calm and rational. 

Track your mood and consumption before and after you smoke to find out if it helps or hurts you."
BipolarReddit,f2f8kme,t3_dd7ubc,1570212973.0,"SPOILERS

I saw the movie yesterday and definitely have mixed feelings about the movie. I felt for him and honestly felt bad for him most of the movie. He was misunderstood and ignored and just went through the motions of the system just to be left behind and abandoned. 

While I understand that they were very accurate in the sense of his original character and going along with how the comic described him but.. i don’t know I had such mixed feelings and got uncomfortable during certain parts. 

Especially the parts when he wrote in his journal stating something along the lines of “the best part of mental illness is when you pretend you don’t have one” idk if that’s exactly it but that hit home for me pretty hard. 

My boyfriend and I saw the movie through 2 completely different lenses."
BipolarReddit,f2eg958,t1_f2dvapk,1570194401.0,I know I should but I’ve been so stubborn refusing to believe that I need it and anytime I’ve tried to get it nobody really knows how to deal with bipolar as a disability. So a lot of times I’ll just deal.

But then I go back and forth if it’s the best choice cause when I get manic I’ll sometimes just start hoarding cannabis (why I have no clue I’ll usually just end up giving it away lol) It’s better to know what exact thing you’re ingesting vs getting that crap on the street.

I stopped smoking a lot and now it’s just the night time mainly and oh my god cannabis does wonders. The mind slows down you can literally feel your body just loosen up and FINALLY you can just stop thinking for a minute. 

At least this is what happens to me. My med doctor tells me I’m making my episodes worse but honesty? I’m small amounts Cannabis can halt an episode when it’s at its worst (as in I’ve been pacing/tensing up/not able to sleep and being  angry for no rational reason) and i can finally fuckin sleep."
