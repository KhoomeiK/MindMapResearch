I didn’t have the best sleep either and since I started taking it with my Zoloft, I have been feeling SO MUCH better.

I also have anxiety, and that’s where the queasiness comes from- especially when you’re trying to eat! It’s very frustrating. 

I am not a doctor, but I recommend you speak to a psychiatrist about this. This is my experience: I spoke to a psychiatrist and was put on Zoloft (25 mg) which helped my anxiety and stopped the queasiness. I then upped my Zoloft to 50mg and was doing okay until I started becoming a little more stressed and I was getting queasy again. I spoke to my psychiatrist about this and she suggested I add 15 mg of Remeron (Mirtazapine) and I am so hopeful things are going to improve for me. The Remeron increases my appetite 10 fold, I sleep great, no queasiness, no anxiety and I feel great. 

It may be worth speaking to your dr and getting referred to psychiatry to manage your depression and possible anxiety. I was always queasy when I tried to eat and had no idea it was anxiety."
Mirtazapine_Remeron,fg6xq29,t3_ewzsci,1580579310.0,I think taking it at 3 am was the problem. Take it at the same time every night at a *normal* bed time.

I woke up groggy and feeling a bit weird for the first 4 days and then I adjusted and now it’s just great sleep and pretty much zero anxiety. I’m of the small percentage who needs to gain weight so the appetite thing is good for me. Good luck OP.

So I worked at Circuit City- remember Circuit City?! That hell hole was the first job I ever had at a delicate 18 years old and had my first ever experiences with the most shady ass people you could work up in your imagination. It was Black Friday. I fucking hate Black Friday. I started work in the cold at 4:00 am. We had a GIANT line of people, most of which camped out from two nights prior. I had been in Customer Service (I was a “CSA” Customer Service Associate Thank you very much) and I was fed up by 2:00 pm- my shift was over at 4:00 pm.  We had insane lines and people were losing their shit in the store. Of course, this was the time where rebates were really popular and we had the stacks of weekly catalogs with deals by the front entrance that *everyone* had gotten a hold of. The catalogs were put out for the week to come and this day in particular, someone made the unforgiving mistake of putting them out. I spent nearly my entire 12-hour shift arguing with customer after customer the deals in the catalog were the following week- there were better deals for Black Friday anyway, but 98% of Circuit City customers want their cake and to eat it too. Well, a woman apparently “stood in line for 2 hours” to try to convince me after 10 hours of Black Friday arguments, to honor a deal from the catalog. At first she was sweet talking: “honey, could you do me a favor? I’m from out of town and...” Nope. “But sweetie, if you could only understand...” Nope. And then out of the blue she leaned over the counter and is about 3 inches from my face when she says “look bitch, I did not just stand in line for 2 hours for you not to give me the price in the catalog..” I LOST IT and started saying lots of four lettered words until suddenly I was gently guided by the shoulders into the back room by a manager.

AskReddit,feva25f,t3_eqies2,1579394961.0,"This happened in October. 

I was going through a rough patch with anxiety and health and decided to get spiritual and buy some crystals. On a Wednesday, I find this crystal store and start looking around. I pick up the first crystal I see, a small nickel sized black snowflake obsidian and grab a few more recommended by the owner. I heard to keep them close to your skin so in my bra they went. 

I wore them that day- the black snowflake obsidian and a couple more. Thursday morning I get ready for the day  and put my crystals back in my bra. Hours later I’m vacuuming and I hear something hit the floor- I bend down and it’s the black snowflake obsidian. I reach into my bra and my other two crystals are there perfectly tucked in. Okay, so I put them all back in my bra and move on. 

It’s now Friday and we had made plans to go to the pumpkin patch with my kids (7 and 9 yo). We were running late so I dressed really fast, wore high waisted tight jeans and tucked my t-shirt in, crystals in my bra. I go quickly downstairs and stand in the kitchen to eat a yogurt when I hear something hit the hardwood. I bend down and it’s the black snowflake obsidian. I have no idea how it would have fallen out of my bra, tucked in t-shirt or tight jeans. This time (and I don’t know what compelled me) but I looked at it and said “fall out one more time and I won’t wear you.” Three strikes your out sorta deal. So I place it back in my bra. 

We get to the pumpkin patch and park about 200 feet from the entrance in an all dirt lot. We make our way to the entrance when I realize I’m going to need my sunglasses. I drag the kids back with me to the car, get my glasses and walk all the way back. We spent about 3 hours at the patch. It was all fun with rides and games and we had a great time. When we’re walking towards the lot to leave, most of the cars were gone and ours sat almost alone where I had parked it. Suddenly my son goes “look!” and bends down to pick something up out of the dirt. IT WAS MY BLACK SNOWFLAKE OBSIDIAN. I am shocked and snatch it from him stopping in my tracks. I look at it closely and it’s absolutely mine when I realize it’s not in my bra with my other two crystals. How. On. Earth?

That evening after telling everyone I knew what an insane experience that was, I looked up the actual meaning of the black snowflake obsidian. It’s purpose is to bring balance of the mind, body and spirit. It removes negativity from a person or a place with ease.. I got to thinking, and realized my son had been going through some emotional changes and a bit of a pain at that time being mean to his sister and such. Apparently the obsidian knew *he* needed it more than I did. But, how did it fall out??

TLDR; Can’t explain how my crystal fell out of my snug bra three times and was found in a nearly vacant dirt parking lot about 3 miles from our home."

I have heard my great aunt and uncle do not plan to divulge the truth - ever and I don’t agree with it. Who knows if I’ll ever spill the beans. Or maybe they’ll see this comment and piece things together... oops."
relationship_advice,fep7dc3,t3_eq822j,1579313786.0,"Absolutely do not carry the burden of her infidelities- and that of the married man. Personally, I wouldn’t anonymously divulge the information nor would I shout it from the roof tops. I like a commenter’s idea of making her squirm. Any opportunity to say she hasn’t been visiting you (which is the blatant truth) I’d take it. Be honest if you’re put on the spot and let her bf figure it out. She’s being a fucking liar cheater home wrecker, her bf is a lazy mooch and her new married fuck boy is another liar cheater dumbass. I get wanting to protect her, but you’re not teaching her anything by keeping her secrets and lying for her. One day she’ll thank you. From one married woman to another, please let THEM figure it out. All you have to do is be honest, sit back and watch it all unravel."

Marriage,fep2mqs,t3_eq3cs0,1579310754.0,"Showers with my hubby are the best. We kick our kids out (7 and 9 yo), lock the door and take 20 minutes to spend time together without distractions. It really is so lovely with or without sex."
AskWomen,fep2dld,t3_eq16tj,1579310593.0,"I dumped a couple long time friends because of this. We’re all adults with busy lives and if our friendship isn’t a two way street, I don’t need it."

AskReddit,feozu9v,t1_feo6emr,1579308990.0,"I would suggest staying clear of sativa strains- sativa aggravates anxiety and for me, totally sets off an anxiety attack. Indica or indica dominant strains would work much better and not set off your anxiety. Also, look into a plant based diet instead. Good luck!"

LetsNotMeet,fen2254,t1_fen0en8,1579275233.0,Oh my god! I’m so sorry to hear that happened to you. I couldn’t imagine.. I hope you were able to recover from that both emotionally and financially. There are people in this world with no morals and it is so very upsetting.
Marriage,felw11o,t3_epoeyi,1579232346.0,Our friendship for sure. We are best friends and share a connection I have never experienced with anyone else before. We are completely transparent with each other and nothing said is ever too crazy- we totally vibe 100% of the time. Humor is a big part of our relationship. We try to never take our trials and tribulations too seriously and work through them as a team. Communication and respect is the most important advice I give when I’m asked. We have been happy together for 14 years so I think we have something pret-ty good.

ptsd,fec6v4h,t1_febhn1n,1578967658.0,Thank you. This is the type of response I was looking for.

englishbulldog,feaygqo,t3_eo7vuu,1578953537.0,I have had Nationwide for years for all four of my bulldogs. The trick is to insure them as puppies before any conditions pop up. They do have a decent plan for adopted pets- I got our rescue on that one and he’s 4 1/2 years old. The reimbursement is 70% with my $250 deductible but we’ve already spent $500+ on his badly infected ears so it’s worth getting most of that back. For my other bulldogs I started the policy at 10ish weeks old and have a 90% reimbursement policy. Filing claims is also really easy with Nationwide. I definitely recommend them.
unpopularopinion,feaxj9o,t3_eo5bdk,1578953235.0,"My kids are 7 and 9 and I have ALWAYS taught them to stand up for themselves even if it means hitting back. Sure, chances are they’ll get in trouble at school be it by the teacher, yard duty or principal. I’ve explained to them what circumstances I will support them in if they choose to reciprocate a beating. They know I’ll go in there guns blazing if my kid was punked first and they were defending themselves. Sometimes it really is the only way to break the bullying cycle."
zoloft,feawwx9,t3_eo5ci5,1578953034.0,The vivid dreams are totally normal and a common side effect of sertraline. I’m on 50 mg since beginning of December and have them on/off. Really depends on the person if they’ll fade away or remain. Try to embrace them!
zoloft,fdwp9es,t1_fdvynzh,1578761035.0,"I had the same experience prior to Zoloft. Mood swings too, that even I would notice but couldn’t control well. According to my therapist, it’s okay that I’m not feeling emotional while on my medication. I am viewing it as a phase in my life that is part of journey to a healthier mental state. The emotions will come back in time, so I’m working on just being happy. Good luck to you! I’m glad it is improving your relationship with your daughter. So important to show our kids it’s a good thing to take care of yourself and make the steps necessary to be a happy and healthy person."
zoloft,fdtxl3f,t3_en0yqc,1578723869.0,"I can’t say I have any idea what your symptoms could be about, but don’t stop taking the dosages cold turkey if you’ve been on them consistently for the last two weeks. See your doctor first. I’m sure whatever is causing your experiences can be fixed. Good luck!"
zoloft,fds91oc,t3_emx152,1578697160.0,"50 mg here and overall I think it makes me happier and more patient- especially with my kids. However, I have a hard time feeling empathy. I was never overly empathetic, but now it’s very minimal and some situations that would normally bring out my soft side or even make me cry, no longer do. 50/50 a good/bad."
AskReddit,fdj7nxl,t3_elhvjj,1578460770.0,"I would get a tortilla, spread ketchup on it, sliced cold cuts and put them on like pepperoni topped with shredded government cheese. Popped that into the toaster oven for 3ish minutes *VOILA!* Poor pizza."
