I can understand why maybe they would be upset - from their side, they would probably think it â€˜selfishâ€™ because they are grieving. Grief can do strange things to peopleâ€™s perceptions and thought processes.

Please donâ€™t ever blame yourself or regret your decision."
Showerthoughts,fg630xm,t3_ewz15b,1580550965.0,"As someone in a psychiatric hospital, being in a small space with lots of people who often have abrasive personalities and/or are mentally unwell makes it v difficult. 

In my hospital, all the patients take care of each other and mother each other but there will always be clashes and shit that goes down regardless of how nice everyone is. We buy food and share it, have mini parties, film nights. It can be â€˜ite.

I donâ€™t think prison is vastly different from psychiatric facilities tbh."

Self absorbed, only caring when something you do piques her interest or benefits her, the rest of the time fucking ignoring you.

For a while I grew up behaving like her. I thought it was normal behaviour. The subtle one upmanship etc.

Then I realised itâ€™s not."
