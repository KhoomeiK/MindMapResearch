depression,f9qrjcj,t1_f9qn6ct,1575565835.0,"Man. I dunno if you will make it to read this. If there is anything i learned from my depression it is that eventhough we stuck in this shitload came out of some evolution's holes, being like us, its the worst of the worst, its like we stole God's money in past life and now paying the price. However, belive me, its not worth it to just end up killing yourself like that. I have been through this. Trust me. If you managed to walk away, you will understand what i am trying to say. And one day, you will be happy not end it up all today. I'm with you buddy. Stay alive"
