I’m glad whatever you did made you think that your better but realistically just because it worked for you doesn’t mean it’ll work for everyone else. 

I’ve gone to family, they’re didn’t care. The few friends I had didn’t care and they eventually all left. One of my best friends from high school was on medication and in therapy. She slit her wrists and died three years ago.

There is no cure for depression you just have to learn to adapt to it. You don’t need to be happy or have friends or whatever to survive."

To much emphasis is put on being happy and making meaningful relationships with other, but I don’t think thats meant for everyone, at least not for someone like me, which Is why I’ve always struggled with it. My problem is I try too hard to be like everyone else, I try too hard to be happy and friendly when in reality I’m miserable, I hate my life, I work at a bullshit job, I’m attending college going into debt for some worthless degree thats just going to get me some bullshit 9-5 desk job until I inevitably drop dead.

I feel like I’m more than content being alone. I think what it is, is I see other people with their friends and I get jealous and wish I had that, but in the grand scheme of things, people are high maintenance. They cause problems, they judge you, and eventually abandon once they realize theres no merit to keeping you around. I just need to learn to be more comfortable on my own."
