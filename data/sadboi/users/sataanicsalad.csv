By culture I was referring rather not to the culture itself, but to perception of history, traditions, Swedish input into worlds progress and such things. What raised my concern is amount of stuff belittling all of it. One of the recent examples is the infamous SAS ad, stating more or less that nothing is truly Scandinavian.

Regarding your question: everything is aimed at reducing public interactions. Museums, galleries and libraries are closed. Karlstejn castle is closed.

See, when  you live in a townhouse or even an average central european house which  are usually 4-6 storeys including attic, the place you live in doesn't  feel monstrous and you have a chance of knowing people living around at  least to some extent. It's easier to change something in the house,  repair, or upgrade. You have some tiny space around it or inside, which  you can change and if something requires an approval from other people,  it's fairly easy to communicate.  


Now, look at those concrete  blocks. Everything is packed inside or underneath, hundreds of people  living in there. Since the whole building is originally ugly, not many  people want to take any care of it, all systems are more complex, harder  to service and maintain, cleaning and repairing is more complicated and  often requires specific service.

realmadrid,fgqbdt2,t3_ezyc45,1581021203.0,"To be honest, I don't miss Mourinho's Madrid at all. I guess, it was nice to watch for an occasional spectator with all the classico brutality and scandals around one of the biggest club, but as a fan, I was kinda sad to see that. I don't know what he does behind the doors, but the only time I saw Marcelo being aggressive and getting a straight red for an unnecessary foul was under him, and that tells a lot. The vibe he gives should be fine for Tottenham: battling, struggling for every point, all that stuff. 

I liked Madrid under Ancelotti because of the spirit and class and I like it under Zidane, although after all these years Zidane as a coach for me is still slightly controversial figure (tactics flexibility wise)"

I was born in Russia and I had a dream to contribute to building of powerful tourism industry in my country, so I went for tourism studies, but after turning 18, while doing my 2nd year of studies, I realized that this country just should exist. Unfortunately it does, but I couldn’t cope with it and I had to move out a few years later. Now I’m an immigrant in Europe working in IT, but doing some very low class stuff since I don’t have proper education. I try to boost my skills, but at times I feel I’m too stupid for this. I live in a constant fear of getting kicked out, thus my permit won’t be prolonged and I will be forced to leave. 

I feel like all the life around me just turns into chasing for a more respectable paycheck to buy things you don’t need and after a few more years pay to restore your health. I feel like it doesn’t make any sense and I just want to cut it off. I think I would already do it if I would have a gun, because I don’t want to try something which is not 100% e.g. CO2 poisoning would severely damage my brain if I would get out of it somehow (a mask goes down or something) 

I don’t know what to do with all this mess going on around and I feel like I’m a tiny unit in a machine of nonsense going down the longest road to nowhere."

Having a bike lane there definitely would help, but I can imagine people not willing to commute there because of the hills and there are multiple huge business centers in the area. I do ride a 8.5 kg road bike and I guess Dutch-bike fans could drop this idea after a few rides.

What would be cool tho is having a longer lane along Vltava. There’s a good one close to Vysehrad but if they would take it though the old town and to the north, it would be cool for long rides and commuting"

At first I thought that I had the grind too coarse, so water moves too freely, but with fine grind it was there same. So, if looks like after the first and the biggest portion being out quickly so liquid goes down, boils there again and goes up and do forth. I'm not really sure that this supposed to work this way, especially from seeing all the videos where it goes gurgling and hissing shortly after the water comes out of reservoir."

Could be also because he relatively often posts bits of Russian culture, media etc. (band called Kino was there several times) In the age of being isolated from the normal world by asshole politicians, totalitarianism and poverty, Kojima shows them that good sides of the culture are still appreciated. 

So, in a way, Kojima is someone who still connects them to the chiral network keeping them from falling into an endless tar pit of self-isolation. Kojima is genius."
