It really helped calm me down and remind myself that I want to move forward with my life. My appointment went well! I was really pushed to seek therapy so I’m trying to muster up the courage to make some phone calls before my next appointment... Anywho, thank you for your kind words. More importantly, thank you for believing in me <3"
