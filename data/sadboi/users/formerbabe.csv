The mom should have definitely gotten a bigger role; all the details and scenes leading up to her introduction and then as soon as we get to know her she gets sick. I didn‚Äôt appreciate the fizzling out either, I know they‚Äôre adults and I suspected it would happen either way but the way they went about it wasn‚Äôt great. Lily and Marshall have always tried their best to stay a part of the group and I didn‚Äôt like how Robin was guilt tripping them about it. Also, the scene right before the wedding when Robin almost gets cold feet and said she should have ended up w Ted made me cringe for some reason.
