BPD,fnjqd2z,t3_g24q3q,1587004562.0,"I am going thru this too :( you are
Not alone"
BPD,fn7ugnp,t1_fn70dlc,1586727874.0,the RESPECT IT seems a little aggressive lol
BPD,fn7u6k2,t1_fn70dlc,1586727711.0,I get what you’re saying - but he’s been the one continuing all the contact and the initiation of what we’ve been doing is 50/50... so?
newfoundland,fdkhglx,t1_fdkhfd7,1578503963.0,Size 7!
newfoundland,fdkg5q6,t1_fdkfxlb,1578503170.0,Very true! I’m going to call! Thanks guys!
newfoundland,fdkepph,t1_fdkdond,1578502293.0,I’ve heard some people say it’s inappropriate or unprofessional to call and ask if a business is hiring but not sure if that’s true or not??😅😂
RATS,f5ayb5y,t1_f5avtr4,1572115286.0,Agree 100%. I intend on going Monday. The issue is where I live there’s only one clinic that isn’t open over the weekend so I’m just trying to help her feel comfortable in the meantime:(
RATS,f5ad67u,t1_f5acun6,1572105262.0,Can the paralysis get better?
BPD,eu4t1z3,t3_cerbb7,1563462535.0,I’m in! Messaging u!
BPD,eu4n0z1,t1_eu4msh4,1563458429.0,"Thank you, this is actually very comforting. It’s such an evil disorder because with overthinking already being such a big thing with BPD, overthinking the diagnosis is just pure hell. I’m trying to be forgiving to myself for not getting much done right now but it’s just tough when the world keeps on moving and I’m in some sort of emotional paralysis..."
BPD,etx39i4,t1_etx0y7n,1563290507.0,"I find it so exciting to be so into someone trust it’s almost like they become the focal point of my happiness? And if they seem distinct or whatever, then EVERYTHING in my life feel awful lol. Even if I’ve only known them a couple of weeks"
BPD,etwxbha,t1_etwvyq1,1563286480.0,"Thanks fo the thorough response! I think I struggle a lot with the fact that if he DOESN’T text back, I’m just going to assume that it’s because he’s completely weirded out, in the worst person ever, etc. Will dbt help with this emotion do you think? I always see rejection as a reflection of just how awful I am as a person"
BPD,etwvnha,t1_etwvgvw,1563285264.0,Omg the brand new personality thing is too real! I’ll suddenly be interested in whatever this person is interested in and just fully idealize them 🤦🏻‍♀️ I’m referred for DBT counselling but it could take seven months to get my first appointment unfortunately
BPD,etwu8g0,t1_etwu33p,1563284209.0,"yeah it’s hard for me to admit that I should just not care about him and focus on me right now, because I like him so much and it feels like It’s going to be SUCH a loss?? But I definitely do need to focus on me ugh, wish I could get in that mindset! Sorry to hear you experience this too:("
BPD,etwtivn,t1_etwsmq8,1563283663.0,"I relate! I’m either coming on too strong or not enough I feel, I don’t know how to stay in between. Because if I actually really like a person I’m all in, and don’t know how to tone it down or be “chill”"
BPD,etwtg62,t1_etwr63l,1563283603.0,"Thanks so much for the reply, and you’re definitely right! The only thing is, it being the first guy I’ve really felt a good connection with in so long I don’t want to lose him fully, I just like his presence etc because we seem to have so much in common. I’m scared me asking him for coffee could be enough for him to just think I’m being toooooo pushy too soon and not even want to associate with me?? And I definitely care as much as I do about it because of the bpd, I just hate to think I messed up yet another connection with a cool person, ugh"
