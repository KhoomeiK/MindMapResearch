Venting is not necessarily bad either, it can be helpful to release frustration, but again you can't be venting all the time about everything. Sometimes you just have to let things go.

I'm sorry somebody made you feel bad about your body, but you can improve how good a partner you are in bed. Don't let the fear that you're not good at it yet stop you, everybody has to start somewhere. And most women don't get off on penetrative sex, so if you figure out how to use your fingers and mouth to make them feel good (and listen and communicate in bed, that always helps) you can still wow your partners.

Another thing to think about is that most people don't stay with the first person they have a relationship with or have sex with, they usually want to sleep with or date at least one other person because they feel they might be missing out, so I wouldn't want to be someone's practice relationship this late in life.

2. Maybe try a different vibrator, maybe the suction one can't get you there. I recommend a bullet vibrator.
3. Are you fantasizing about anything while you're masturbating? I can't orgasm if I'm not thinking about things that turn me on. Try watching porn or reading erotica to get ideas if you want (or think about past experiences you've had with other people if you have). Sometimes it helps to think about these things before you actually start masturbating, so that you're already turned on. 
4. Try a different position. Sometimes it works lying on my back, sometimes on my stomach. Or make sure you are pulling your clitoral hood back, maybe that is decreasing the sensation for you. 
5. The only other thing I can suggest is that there's a website called omgyes that supposedly teaches you how to orgasm through videos and other resources. I think you have to pay for it but it seems like what you might be looking for. 

Hope some of that helps."

Your husband needs to seriously look at how pregnancy will affect you if he actually cares about you, and stop talking about how much he is sacrificing when really you will be the one sacrficing.

Do you think it's smart to risk yourself or your newborn baby getting covid when there isn't a vaccine or treatment available? Will you be able to go to checkups with your newborn? If people are still going to be self-isolating next winter/spring, will you two be able to cope with that while dealing with the stress of a baby? Lots of people require support from their families and friends even just to get a break. Have you guys talked about any of this?

And why did he pay for college if he expects you to get pregnant before you even graduate? It will have been a huge waste of money if you never end up working in your field. Its very difficult to get a job a year or two after graduating, even when there aren't 30 million unemployed people to compete with.

You guys are very focused in your wants and the timeline, but you really need to look at the logistics of whatever decision you make."
todayilearned,fps2hv0,t1_fps1kwo,1588866371.0,I'm 25 and it's been happening since I was a kid without getting any worse. Something happening a few times a year is not a disorder. And I drink plenty of water every day.  It's more likely caused by occasionally being less hydrated.
tifu,fps1oe2,t1_fps10wm,1588865985.0,Right but don't you leave your device outside of the bathroom? How else would they be able to hear you? If you're in meetings all day I'm not sure what boss would not expect you to go to the bathroom once or twice during the day.
tifu,fprwipd,t1_fprmt46,1588863385.0,Really? The second one is really weird. Why would you go to the bathroom while videochatting or even calling someone? Obviously they'll be able to hear you. If you can't wait I would just say you need to go to the bathroom and will be back in two minutes.

Some of that is societal influence sure...but if you need society to approve of you taking an active role, then maybe you're not mature enough to be a parent. There are plenty of resources nowadays if you're not sure, and some of it starts by just doing what needs to be done, and not expecting your wife to tell you what to do."

LifeProTips,fpmkoeb,t3_geases,1588735201.0,"I didn't speak to any counselors and I transferred from a community college to a four year university just fine. You do have to know which specific school you want to transfer to, and which program you are going into, so that you can check which courses count as more than a gen ed and are also accepted for the specific program. I started college 8 years ago and even then most colleges had transfer equivalency guides. You may have to take a break due to scheduling conflicts, that is true, but I used that time to work full time and save money. I will admit that I was also lucky enough to have a very good community college in my area, so that may have made it easier for the coursework to transfer. But some states have statewide initiatives between community colleges and four year universities stating that the coursework has to transfer.

You can be successful, you just have to plan very carefully and realize you may not graduate in 4 years. Personally I think an extra semester or year is worth not incurring massive debt though."

There is no amendment allowing you to force someone to speak to you. There is an amendment for due process though, but they just wanted to be judge and jury that day too. Guess they stopped at the second amendment.

And stop playing dumb. If you just want to have a conversation with someone, you don't bring your guns. If you fear for your life, sit your ass at home when the person is not headed in your direction.

I don't think refusing to wash your hands after using the bathroom when you share a living space with others is considerate at all, and it's also part of the CDC guidelines to do so now. Which she should be aware of if she's working in a pharmacy.

I don't know if she is or is not washing her hands after coming home from work yet. And no, I'm not expecting people to sanitize everything, but it is basic common sense (and really a requirement, if you are at all a professional) to wash your hands once when you come home if you were just out working in a hospital or a pharmacy. Is it really such an inconvenience to take 20 seconds to stop the spread of a really terrible disease? If you live by yourself, take all the risk you want, but she doesn't. She was telling me about a high demand for antinausea meds she is filling for covid patients at work, so she is likely in contact with some airborne particle or contaminated surface at some point in her day."
