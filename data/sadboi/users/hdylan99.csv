Next, i definitely wouldnt mind the omen x, but doing some more research, i cant find anywhere that actually has it in stock so even if i price matched, i wouldnt be able to take advantage of the 230$ off so i dunno if thats an option anymore just based on availability unfortunately :/ 

As with the other specs though, ya the 240hz is definitely a big step up, would be a nice feature for the less intensive games, but im sure i wouldnt be able to take advantage of it if im playing something harder to run at max settings. 

Response time isnt something im toooo worried about, its only like 1ms difference which i wouldnt be able to notice if i tried, and tbh i even heard the gl850 has the nicer looking display because of the nano ips.

Am not tryna shit on ur reasoning btw, you are right, but just now that i think of it, the differences dont seem sooo big/worth it apart from the 240 vs 144hz.
