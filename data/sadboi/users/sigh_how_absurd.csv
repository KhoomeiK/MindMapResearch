depression,fpf2pbw,t3_gcqww5,1588560391.0,This keeps bringing me down too. I know people say that life isn't a race... but technically it is... No girl/business opportunity/whatever you are after/ is going to wait for you to handle your little breakdown.
depression,f1h7nmm,t3_d9crb8,1569487420.0,"I'd do that. I would like to read books and figure some things out. Feel so trapped in the daily grind, wasting all my mental energy at work. Life feels like a waste of time."
Mindfulness,f12zzlv,t3_d6z0i0,1569150181.0,"Someone once told me you should cherish your happy memories because they'll keep you going when life gets tough. 
I wonder often though what if your past is filled with dark memories? You can keep them at bay on normal days, when you have energy to spare. It's in the hard moments that the dam breaks and everything you've suppressed comes rushing."
confidence,f12vv4w,t3_d7mkxy,1569147677.0,"Fear is definitely a part of it. For me it's usually fear then anxiety then procrastination and in the end depression because inrealize I've gone through all this countless times and noatter how many battles I win, the next one is just as hard."
confidence,ezvwjr2,t1_ezvvch9,1568200257.0,"I get optimistic and things start working out, then I relapse to my old self, usually when I'm confronted by stressful events. It' s one step forward, two steps back all the time."
confidence,ezvweiy,t1_ezvrbee,1568200100.0,"yeah about going out of my comfort zone... I do that. But it never gets easier. For example I used to get very anxious aroud authority figures (professors, bosses etc). From experience I know that I will eventually see flaws in every person, see they're just human like I am and relax around them. But even though I know that I always get them same anxious reaction.  
I'm currently trying to switch jobs and I'm having the same panic attacks that I had when I started college. It's disheartening to say the least."
