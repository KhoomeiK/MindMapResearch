Earlier the year (you can read it on the bottom) of the pet for ex. ‚Äù2008 hasbro‚Äù would be worth more than a pet that says it had made in 2010. (Blue magnets)... A rare pet shop/older would be more around 30.00‚Äì50.00 and the newer/cheaper one's ranging from 2-10.00. Average pet I would price around 10.00-20.00 if it's older. The pet shops that I have bought online are like 35.00 lol so old ones like that (2004-06) are most expensive for sure  

As for your LPS happy meal toy from 2015 that would be well under 5.00 XD however I own 2 from 2005 which would be worth something.

I was raised so I never had tantrums. I had one in a grocery store when I was 2. My mom simply didn‚Äôt say a word, and took me back to the car and left me in the back seat with my aunt. Then she went back inside and finished the grocery shopping.

I don‚Äôt recall any other time in my childhood having a tantrum. Parents who just allow their kids to humiliate themselves and feed into their meltdowns make me shake my damn head. Ask them what‚Äôs on their mind and offer them logical options. 

If they are out of control, they need a time out somewhere quiet. For not only their own sake but everyone else‚Äôs."
