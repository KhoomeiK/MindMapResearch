Start dating other men. Or hookup with other men. The more men you get in your life the less you chance you will direct everything towards your best friend. I'm not saying go have a huge hoe faze. But getting your mind off him will help significantly. Force yourself to date. And when you are on that date do not think of your bestie. Don't compare dates to your bestie. Pretend he does not exist while on the date!

So yes the illness guides feelings but at the end of the day it is your choice to actively fight it or not.

All your friends over years clearly couldn't do shit for you being empathic. You acknowledge what they have said yet refuse to believe or actually listen to them. Why? Being it's easier to loathe in self pity.

And it is me in my dark hole is it not? The words we use to ourself over time is the reason we can't cope with life. Our fault.

I am currently in the second category but I havent given up yet on making it to the first.

I guess I just see it more black and white. I don't pity people with self depression as some do. I know I am miserable mostly by my failures and lack of will power to change my life. Plus it's easier to bitch and loathe in self pity then get up and do something about it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Take some responsibility for your words and actions. It may be heavily influenced by your mental illness. But key word 'your' mental illness. I can choose to better myself. To not give up.

I rarely use my dildos. But if I'm in the mood I will. With the right stretching, lube, you can stretch your hole to where it's comfortable. Perhaps you just have a really tight hole? Maybe try a different lube? Are you finding your prostate with your fingers/toys? Maybe you just aren't in the mood when you do it?

The biggest annoyance for me is being clean down there. Douching is something that doesn't work for me so I rarely can so it unless I actually get a proper diet which is something I am working on.

Discuss that you c√†nt live your life with him if he refuses to stay in the closet. Make your case and communicate this to him. Show him why it's so important to you.

If he shuts you down again and absolutely refuses than I think you have your answer.

Besides this I think your friend is problematic for A) breaking the surprise to you. B) Trying to convince you to break up with him. It's not his place. Probably has motives as well.

askgaybros,fqqewhp,t1_fqq3dr0,1589564331.0,I mean it is quite let's say noticable...
askgaybros,fqqemk9,t1_fqqeamp,1589564196.0,Yeah unfortunately I'll have to move before that and it ain't happening cut two years haha
askgaybros,fqqdm39,t1_fqp4fv9,1589563695.0,Listen in not saying there aren't those that cherry pick which stories to follow to try to make queers look bad. It happens. I'm just saying that there is still a lot to do and I just don't hold the community in such high esteem based on my own experiences that are not based on what the right says.
askgaybros,fqqdcnr,t1_fqqda3x,1589563566.0,True... I can't wait till book stores open againü§§ü§§
askgaybros,fqqda64,t1_fqpfote,1589563532.0,Well just go where the night leads you. For my movie date I provided drinks and snacks and went from there. Cuddled a lot. Did lead to some fooling around later. But this was also like the third date.
askgaybros,fqqd0um,t1_fqph1da,1589563406.0,"No, Canadian so close enough to know all this issues that effect my country."
askgaybros,fqp3q94,t1_fqp3hg0,1589533938.0,"Thats Trumps. The rights last attempt at clinging onto the past. Which won't last. 

Not to mention redditors at best are stupid. Who follow a hivemind and think they are superior to everyone else in the world. Which in reality they are not. Why? Idk only the losers at school ( myself included ) are the ones who went on Reddit. And it's filled with a generally white male western demographic. Hense why despite their incel hating ways, calling women thots are no different. My point? There hypocrites.

So using Redditors as a basis for any argument is just entirely flawed and means jack shit."
askgaybros,fqp3i2z,t3_gk3ws5,1589533709.0,"This will not work.I don't think they realize the damage on the human psyche this will have. To what? Not have any external human contact for years on end? Its not possible to have isolation for that long periods. 

Even me, who's a giant introvert who didn't have any issues the first two months am starting to go a little stir crazy. And mostly because the realization is hitting that I'm going to be stuck in more fucking awful online classes for fall semester. Which will straight up fucking suck and it's basically my only social interactions in life.

I think suicides are going to spike to a new high."
askgaybros,fqp38w1,t1_fqp2ygi,1589533442.0,"I don't listen to any right wingers. So I don't really know what nail you hit.

I don't hold the community in extreme high esteem. They deserve criticism just as much as any other group. There's a hundred internal issues ignored by the community because they only want to focus on the outside. Yet racism, homophobia, biphobia, transphobia, fem and fat shaming all persist. Yet no one in the community cares about that. Since they can't blame it on the straighties then.

Yes we have all benefited from the gay rights movements. Does that mean these are all the core issues for today? There are still waves to be made. But if I'm honest I've been treated to date worse by queers than by straights. And yes this is my experience, likely not most, but for me it's what I have experienced. So I won't stick my head in the sand and believe that the queer community is perfect. It is definitely not."
askgaybros,fqp2yy8,t1_fqp2fp9,1589533156.0,"Well you don't have enough info to actually know and regardless no one here can tell you either or.

I don't know what kind of relationship you have with him. What kind of sex you have; IE if you have explored his ass or not. Or if that is even remotely possible to explore. If its even possible for you to sort of test him with porn.

Regardless it's up to you. You could test him. Watch his reactions. Or maybe work to better him and try to weed out his homophobia. And see how going down that path will work.

Would it be a deal breaker for him if you tried to make him a better person? Would he sit and watch a wholesome gay flic with you without going into a rageful fit if you asked him to; BoyErased, maybe Rocketman or the Queen one.

But again. Chances are he's just a homophobe."
askgaybros,fqp2ng9,t1_fqp2cet,1589532837.0,"Your logic is kind of flawed to begin with. You assume that these people giving communities a bad name are automatically set up and are acting it? Which I don't agree with at all. It's the fact that every group has radicals that drag their names down. 

Third wave feminism for this reason is flawed. Because they have decided to defend every radical/a large portion of ideas that many real feminists don't agree with. Like the movements denying white woman in feminist groups. Claiming only women of color know real struggle.

Which is the same for queers. Radical queers give everyone a bad name but do queers debate it? Some may but the community more or less impales itself on its sword.

Also because they are super disorganized as there is no real feminists leadership or queer leadership. Thus when someone criticises either all both groups see is the need to quicky defend.

It's like when that black celebrity faked his abuse by Trump supporters. It was fucking obvious from the start he framed it. But this sub and the community were in up roar."
askgaybros,fqp2dow,t1_fqp22ry,1589532561.0,"Yeah idk I don't think those are enough to warrant him being gay... Guys are quite envious of more muscular men in a bro way/something to aspire to.

Like I said you would have to spring some tests on him to watch for his reaction more than just him looking a shirtless pic."
askgaybros,fqp22qm,t1_fqp1t06,1589532252.0,"Yeah so his sister has a shitty bro. How did her family take her coming out? 

It's quite common for queers to get this reaction. While times are changing and many aren't outright disowned they will still have homophobic relatives who are now suddenly related to a queer so it's more personal for them. And not something they enjoy."
askgaybros,fqp1yzo,t1_fqp1rav,1589532147.0,"Well if he grew up in homophobia it's not a surprise he's homophobic ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Could always put on some movies with some steamy gay scene that you could sneak on him to see his reaction. If beyond his anger and disgust there's something else. I'm sure there is other ways. Watch some porn with him and spring a Bi scene with two dudes and a girl.

But honestly he's probably just another homophobic douche."
askgaybros,fqp1ss6,t1_fqour1u,1589531974.0,I mean James is a hoy mess. But probably your generations version of him Jeffrey star ain't any better. Just all bad role models for everyone. But then again that's like every YouTube personality.
