SGExams,fft4u6a,t3_ev20eg,1580207181.0,"My sister only scored 77.5 rp and was offered interview. She passed the interview and is now currently a y1 archi student. iirc there were many many people asked to go for interview despite their rps. Getting in is one thing but when you actually get in, it actually is hell so you rly need that mental preparation.

Interview and aptitude test wise, they were given a theme and asked to build a model based on it..I think it was a paper model? Not sure. My sister didn't manage to complete the model but her explanation and idea were good enough. And no, my sister did not bring a portfolio of any kind although she did get an A1 for O level art. According to her, they asked questions like why archi, and what other courses she applied.

Teaching faculty wise, there are some toxic professors that actually promote no sleep lmao like they will brag to other teachers about the fact that their students got no sleep....I don't have a good impression of nus archi at all bec literally 0 work life balance,, you don't even get to sleep,,,

edit: my sister did bring her o level artwork for the interview however the panel of 3 ""judges??,, didn't really focus on it, they focussed more on her model and her ideas. She also mentioned that they do grill you about your model and ideas during the interview. She also said that it would be good if you could read up on some articles regarding archi themes??? just for some background knowledge to help you with your aptitude test"
