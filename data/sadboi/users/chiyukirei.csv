dating_advice,fn9flj5,t3_g00795,1586771076.0,"I hate dating apps. I‚Äôve been single going on 6 yrs since I got out of a toxic relationship (my 1st & only relationship). I‚Äôve been on the apps for maybe 5 yrs but never used them because I do the same as you. I download it briefly, get depressed, & delete them. I don‚Äôt have much faith in these apps. I get no matches and when I do never in my life have I ever spoken to dry/uninterested people in my life. I‚Äôve only met with 2 guys off an app & both went awful. 

In Nov. 2019 that I actually used an app for real & in Dec I saw a guy for the 1st time in yrs. It was going ok until he went on vacation suddenly, came back, & was ignoring me. I finally said something about it & he told me he was depressed from work. I told him if he needed someone to talk to he could‚Äôve talked to me. He never responded & I haven‚Äôt heard from him since. GHOSTED UGH

In mid Feb I met a 2nd guy off an app & I was so hopeful about. Prior to meeting I actually liked this one a lot. After we met he suddenly got REALLY weird on me... needless to say I wasn‚Äôt going to talk to him after that BUT I didn‚Äôt ghost him. I told him my feelings straight up. Then this coronavirus thing happened immediately after. 

I don‚Äôt mind being single & alone. I‚Äôve come to love my solitude, especially when my friends in relationships complain to me about their s/o‚Äôs or seeing all the reddit posts about peoples relationships. Its mostly when I want to go do things & my friends are busy is when I want a boyfriend. I know I‚Äôm not bad looking, I think I‚Äôm alright. But these stupid apps make me feel like I‚Äôm ugly & can only attract stale men."

I am open to making new friends wherever possible."
demisexuality,f6jsrds,t3_driqr7,1572899664.0,"Theres nothing wrong with being Demisexual. Its not a weakness. For me, I‚Äôve only ever had one partner and I haven‚Äôt had one since, its been 5 years. I want to find someone I am close to and love before taking that step if I do take that step. I‚Äôm a 26F and when I tell people that they don‚Äôt believe me (literally had my doctor tell me I was a liar because I said I only had the one partner 5 years ago). I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm demisexual or Gray Romantic Ace but I don‚Äôt really find my sexuality as something that‚Äôs a big deal. 

I completely understand that it hurts that people think there‚Äôs something wrong with you because you don‚Äôt want to have sex or that you prefer being loved over sex. My mom always says she will accept me no matter what I am but when I say I‚Äôm ace she says ‚ÄúNo you‚Äôre just scared to have sex. We are all sexual beings. Don‚Äôt put that label on yourself‚Äù. Its like this big stigma if you don‚Äôt engage in it, I guess. You HAVE to have sex and if you don‚Äôt you‚Äôre broken. 

It definitely makes dating difficult too because you‚Äôre not on the same page as anyone else. But there are others out there, though its a bit hard to find, who will be on the same page as you. You will also want to love you for who you are before taking that leap. You‚Äôre value is not determined by your sexual orientation or how much sex you have. You‚Äôre you and it‚Äôs important to embrace who you are regardless of other people‚Äôs opinions."

I‚Äôm definitely trying! Its been rough which is why I stayed single for so long. I wanted to heal more so I wouldn‚Äôt ruin my next relationship but I also was trying to at least put myself out there at the same time."
dating_advice,f58ws0w,t1_f54rkn7,1572065997.0,It does and doesn‚Äôt bother me. I‚Äôve been fine until my friend got her boyfriend this week. She was my last single friend and so I‚Äôve been really by myself. Idk maybe one day I‚Äôll find someone but I don‚Äôt have any expectations towards it.

asexuality,et8ffyn,t3_ca1v46,1562554994.0,"I've never been one to be concerned with my sexuality. Its never been an issue but it was expressed to be my a friend who said he thinks I am asexual. I then mentioned it to a few other friends who also agreed with his statement. I think I fall within the spectrum but I don't really know now, thinking more on the gray sexual side.

If your arm so much as rubs onto mine accidentally as you're sitting next to me, I may not outwardly show it but on the inside I'm annoyed. Yeah I may have social anxiety and I'm afraid of people. But even with the people I do know and the people I love I still can't stand it."
CasualConversation,erji2wo,t1_ergmnzp,1560930672.0,"I have had other experiences though nothing as intense as that, and I haven't had anything besides minor ones in a long time since I have shied away from it a lot after I was pushed. I had a time I was asleep and my dog was asleep with me at my feet. I woke up to her growling and I didn't know why. I pulled off my eye mask to see a man's face glowing and extremely close to mine. I gasped so loud I lost my voice the following day. I was trying so hard to convince myself I was dreaming and that I wasn't seeing what I was seeing. I reached out to see if it was real, he vanished, and I ran to turn my light on. 

&#x200B;

Another time when I was in high school my friend was spending the night and we were supposed to be up super early so my mom told us to go to bed early. We didn't of course and were up all night talking until we heard foot steps. We thought it was my mom coming to tell us to go to bed. So we turned the light off and just waited to see what happened next. Suddenly a bright blue/white ball of light light up my room above my friend and I. We screamed and hid under the blankets both of us refusing to get out to turn the light on. In the morning when I asked my family if they heard us screaming in the middle of the night they all said they didn't."
CasualConversation,ergklix,t3_c1rj5a,1560843968.0,"Absolutely!  I have a whole bunch of stories. This particular time I was at my old girls scout camp that is extremely haunted. There was apparently a fire in one of the buildings(the library) a long time ago. Rumor had it you could no longer light a fire in the room without putting a chair in front of the fire place and inviting the spirit that inhabited the library to join you at the fire and that you will not burn anything else but what was in the fireplace. My friends decided that they were going to light a fire. I was on the other side of the building and they came running to get us saying that they had been trying for a long time to get the fire to light. Of course I was intrigued and followed them back to the library along with my mom and my friend. I watched them try to light the fire for awhile until someone grabbed a chair and put it in front of the fire place, invited the ghost to have a seat, and said we were only going to start a fire in the fireplace and no where else. As soon as she did that the fire lit and stayed lit. I had prior ghost experiences but for whatever reason I decided not to believe it was true and stuck my hand into the chair. I will never forget the cold, icy, electric charged air I felt as I stuck my arm in. Everyone else followed suit as I went and hid behind my friend and next to my mom. Next thing I know someone said the air was gone and I was relieved thinking it left. OH IT LEFT ALRIGHT but not without making its presence known to me. There was a gap between my mom and I, just enough for someone to squeeze through if needed. Suddenly a blast of air and force pushed me backwards, like someone shoving past me and slamming me with their shoulder. It felt like a person shoved past me but there was no one there. I started crying instantly as my mom tried to comfort me as we left the library, insisting that no one was there and it was just a gust of air or something, that she didn't feel a thing. It wasn't until the next day when we got back home that my mom said it shoved her too but she didn't want to say anything because I was already so upset. I never went back to that camp after that..."
CasualConversation,ergjurm,t3_c1hqpa,1560842857.0,I do all the time. Especially right now since I feel like I am stuck in a rut without a person who really knows me well enough anymore (no SO or best friend). I have friends but no one is close enough to really know how I feel or anything like that. It wouldn't really matter much if I just disappeared.
