Parenting,fngwfs0,t3_g1gma1,1586947495.0,Lol Google made me the same video recently! My daughter is 13 months old and Google compiled all the videos of me encouraging her and loving on her. Giggles and all. Let me tell you what. I bawled too. My bff is so big but she's so so so perfect. Keep enjoying every moment 💕
breakingmom,fn6xljz,t3_fzvlh4,1586709324.0,Yes!! Enjoy! 😊
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,fmsubsu,t1_fmsstyc,1586362130.0,"Yay! I hope you're doing well. Recovery sucks sometimes. Buuuuut I kinda work my own program. Mostly telling myself that I will go absolutely nowhere in life if I ever pick up a drink again scares me enough to stay away. It's pretty like much mental strength for me which I know does not work for everyone. My husband is great and doesn't drink at all which helps. No booze in the house. I do smoke weed though (it's legal where I am) and that helps me enormously (maybe it's a different vice and it's bad, idk). But I am way more productive when I do and it has me take a deeper look on the inside of me. I just follow my heart and meditate and all that bullshit. I'm jsut not religious or spiritual and I feel like it's my responsibility to take care of myself and not blame my actions on some ""plan"" God made for me as well as billions of other people or whatever. I hope this kinda helps! How are you doing with it all??"

DecidingToBeBetter,fmlr2ua,t1_fmlmi7e,1586191663.0,Totally agreed. I mean I never like didnt want to do them per say.... Just like never got the time to jsut not being doing something. From 18-25 I've been useless. I want to figure out how to gain momentum again.
DecidingToBeBetter,fml218p,t1_fml0khz,1586176497.0,Right? I'm just tired. And I'm tired of being tired. Ugh. Life is hard work lol. (Throwing momentary pity party 🎉)

MomForAMinute,fkm6erv,t3_fiz7z2,1584322010.0,Happy birthday!!! I am proud of you for pursuing your dream and bring happy 😄
raisedbynarcissists,fkk3lqz,t3_fisl9r,1584272103.0,Yep. All the sudden they were proud. Now I have a one year old daughter and it's a whole different level of manipulation to be able to see her. It's gross. At least you can recognize it happening and not fall for it. I'm sorry you have to deal with that though.
family,fjafm2w,t3_fcdck5,1583172499.0,Don't let them open any credit in your name!!
breakingmom,fiwvwef,t3_fa0184,1582805166.0,"I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. My babe went through this too. She's almost one now (tears!). But it does get better. My child hated being held or snuggled (still does) but that gets better too. Your babe probably hates being a baby trapped. Once mine could move she was so much happier. But she was also SUPER allergic to milk... So look into that. We were on Alimentum for months (specialized formula) and it worked wonders. I have so much left over if you'd like me to send it to you to try. You will get through this. I'm sorry you got one of the tough ones. But once she gets older you will realize that the personality that comes with that is amazing. My daughter is so funny and smart and SUPER INDEPENDENT, which honestly is a blessing when you're trying to get shit done. I promise it will get better. It's a hard few months and around month 5 it'll turn for the better. I'm not going to tell you to do anything because unfortunately it's just the way your baby is. But she loves you and she's jsut having a rough time adjusting. But really check out milk allergies cuz we thought she had colic and it was not. I could hear her little tummy grumbling. 

Best of luck to you and your family and let me know if you need that formula! Your baby loves the fuck outta you 👍"

If you can articulate well what happened you will be totally fine. Just plan ahead what you may say when employers ask and maybe cross check it with someone you trust to give you professional advice. Otherwise, you should be fine and I hope you find the job you're looking for 😄"
Dissociation,fi82lrv,t3_f6y18m,1582232274.0,Meditation is great. Also maybe ADHD? I got meds for it after being diagnosed with bipolar and it changed me 180°. Just something to maybe look into if you're okay with medicating.

Parenting,fhio1hm,t1_fhi91mr,1581628490.0,Thank you ♥️ it's nice to hear I'm not alone or crazy. I should probably ask my MIL for more help until I can get my brain pieced together.
