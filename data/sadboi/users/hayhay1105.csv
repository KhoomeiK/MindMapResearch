I think it's justifiable, but I don't think the right measures were taken after. Nick doesn't deserve life in prison and they both deserve mental help. Neither of them ever got it and Nick is mentally challenged, ya know. It seems way too harsh to me. But then I think- it WAS murder. It's just crazy to think I'm justifying it, but I am. 

Gypsy dealt with a whole shit ton and I can really understand why she wanted and thought she needed to do what she did. I watched an interview yesterday where she said she never thought to just stand up in a public place and show everyone the truth. She obviously had some sort of younger mindset or emotional delay. When she met Nick she just grew up like, what, 10 years in suck a short period of time.  I truly think the grew up SO fast when she met Nick. They fell deep in love and she was already miserable, abused and shamed before meeting him, but he was a big step in her choice. I think it really is terrible that Dee Dee is dead, but in the situation she was in.. you can't go back. 

I think it's crazy how she just did and said whatever he wanted her to. She has said in interviews that she didn't really like to be like that. She was the slave and he was the master, and he had all of his different personalities. It's just, all of their texts seem like she liked it a little? I don't know. How long do you think she was planning ACTUALLY to have her killed? It could have been longer than she said? Did she just deal with it and act like she loved him because she knew he would do it from the way start? I dunno"
