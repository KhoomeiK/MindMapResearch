They're just jealous they weren't badass enough to be with the rest of us fucking Adonis' over here tongueing the assholes of war criminals and sociopaths.

SuicideWatch,f7x6tfl,t1_f7x6hb8,1574047859.0,"I dont think existence is a good thing, I hate it and if there were a god I would devote everything I have to spitting in his face. I just don't see death being a better alternative, death is horrifying. 

The complete obliteration of a unique self aware being is one of the most revolting aspects of reality and one that I cannot and will not accept. I dont want people to be erased, and I don't want to be erased either (in spite of how much I fantasize about killing myself)."
SuicideWatch,f7w1lfk,t1_f7uuc70,1574028984.0,"You cant feel relief if you're dead. Your entire existence, your sense of self and everything that makes up who you are, gets obliterated into nothingness. 

And the very last thing you will have felt will have been despair, anguish and pain."
VeganMartyr,f7je9xf,t3_dw8t55,1573775784.0,"I would much rather neither of those things happen. I dont care what your excuses are, if you want me to support the killing of perfectly healthy animals for any reason whatsoever you can go fuck yourselves. There are better ways to deal with the problems of animal overpopulation and abuse than just straight fucking murder. There are lines we do not cross. 

Or have you all forgotten how big of a deal death is? God this sub is trash."
