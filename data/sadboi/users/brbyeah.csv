Anxiety,fbz6tcx,t3_ef8hhk,1577236872.0,"It sounds like you’re both super stressed with the baby and it’s having different affects on each of you. For her maybe she’s still hormonal and lashing out (not excusing the behaviour) and for you it’s making your anxiety worse. I think you need to have an open and honest conversation with her about how hurt you feel and that it’s normal for you to be a bit more anxious at the moment as it’s your first child. I’d also see from your end if there’s any support you can get from your GP that may help alleviate your anxieties and maybe they can speak to your partner about anxiety and genetics to reassure her. She needs to apologise for what she said as it’s unacceptable. It seems as though tensions are high at the moment so perhaps revisit in the new year when the baby is a bit older and you’re both more used to being parents. 

Wish you the best."

The way you’ve described the girl, I question her ability to be able to have capacity to consent. This could lead your son into a lot of problems especially legally. You said she has the mental capacity of a young child, and young children cannot consent. Therefore, had the relationship progressed, I’d be worried for both of them. 

He probably is feeling like due to his disability that was his only shot at someone that understood him and could love him so perhaps finding other groups or activities he could join might be a good idea?"
