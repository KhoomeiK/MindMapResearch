There's not much known about this virus nor is it known if surviving it gives you immunity against it. Apparently SARS could reinfect you just fine and they reckon this one might be the same in that respect.

In extension, given that the world population is only slightly under 8 billion and assuming everybody in the world eventually gets infected, you're looking at 240 million people dying worldwide. Whilst yes, most people will be just fine, please do remember guys that most people aren't massively concerned for themselves either. It's their elderly or immunocompromised loved ones they're concerned about. Similarly, there's no guarantee the virus won't mutate and begin wiping out people who don't fall into either of the two above categories or who survived the first wave."
