I’d seriously like SERIOUSLY (not like all the other times before that) planned to take my life at the beginning of summer 2017, and I obviously didn’t go through with it. After that I decided that my old self basically died on that day. It’s cliché, but a new me was born the very next day. I made a real effort to change my life around. Started doing things the way I wanted to do them. Studied what I wanted. Exercised every day. Changed my eating habits. It made a difference. 2018 ended up being the best year of my life by far.
