Psychiatry,flqky8t,t1_flq08w5,1585398664.0,I understand that and it’s just frustrating especially when it’s not just a patient but someone in your life you truly care about and you can see the solution but they just won’t accept it or you don’t know have the necessary knowledge on how to change their perspective

Psychiatry,flqkcvg,t1_flpr4h1,1585398072.0,"That was a while ago and I completely understand now that you are right it wasn’t a good timing, but I see it all the time with that particular person, some sort of go to response to them is “oh I can’t do x when because of my mental illness” and while some are valid most of the time it leaves with a sense of why are you doing this to yourself?"

Psychiatry,flpkjii,t1_flpji67,1585361685.0,"But that’s not my point, if someone continuously blames things on their disease when it’s clearly unrelated, isn’t that a problem on its own?

Psychiatry,flpkdxa,t1_flpjp6m,1585361577.0,"Maybe you’re right but more than resentful id say I’m just frustrated,  how do we handle these cases? 

I was a big fan of narrative Psychaitry from the moment I read my first book on it, because it made so much sense to a lot of the cases I saw, where people are stuck in a mentality that they’re sick and they can’t get better and an aspect would be to change their personal narrative to a more empowering one"
Psychiatry,flpjpqj,t1_flpidc6,1585361104.0,"I’m grateful for your replies I honestly am, it showed me that i have a long road ahead of me and I’m not gonna lie and say I’m 100% convinced because I still believe that in some cases it’s easier for people to blame a disease external to them rather than themselves, but this has given me an insight that I should automatically assume that they’re right and not wrong as you have put it “believe”"
Psychiatry,flpibnf,t1_flpgrxy,1585360149.0,"Thank you for putting both perspectives, I understand that I might’ve been naive about the whole thing, but my point is that I doubt having fun that thought process is healthy. 

I sort of agree with everything but if someone isn’t trying to do better and change and just blames his faults at his illness, isn’t that a problem on it own that needs to be sorted out?

What if for example a person diagnosed with depression tells himself that I’ll never be happy this is just how my brain works, that sounds like an unhealthy narrative that should be altered?"
Psychiatry,flphhti,t1_flpg0t2,1585359600.0,"I fully understand and what you’re saying and I’ll admit  that I might have a been immature in that regard. 


However won’t the factors you mentioned be characterized as unhealthy coping mechanism, let’s say you try teaching someone a coping technique and their reply is oh but my brain doesn’t work like that, when it does, without even trying, or someone automatically saying they’re gonna fail academically because they have ADHD, I doubt that this narrative is healthy and we shouldn’t touch on that. 

My whole idea on this changed when I did an elective in a psych center which focused on narrative Psychaitry, and I saw a lot of people with chronic disease blaming their problems on the disease, I honestly don’t know and would just like to figure out the correct reasoning and how to act on the future, I understand that the issue is more complex but can’t help but feel like people’s approach is unhealthy but don’t know what to do about it"

[The association between relationships and mental health is clearly bidirectional, however, stronger effects are observed when mental health is the outcome and relationships are the predictor, suggesting that the causal arrow flows more strongly from relationships to mental health than vice versa. Moreover, improving relationships improves mental health, but improving mental health does not reliably improve relationships.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28813281/) 

As mentioned in this systemic review relationships have a strong impact on our mental health, it’s not about the other person but our own benefit, and centered around having better mental well being. 

Also, again this isn’t about my personal opinion, the definition of a depressive attack (which is statistically more prevalent) in the DSM is that it last for 6 months, several attacks within a short period of relapse time changes the diagnosis into major depressive order. 

Finally, much like a doctor would sometimes recommend you to stop exercise till an injury heals to prevent further in Jordan, some doctors might think you need a break from dating for a while and at the end of the day you can take that advice or ignore it, you still have autonomy, I’m just explaining the medical rational behind it which is built on lots of research"
mentalhealth,fhew7fg,t1_fhcyxpt,1581531166.0,"The whole point is it be content with yourself, understand your own thoughts and feelings before dealing with somebody else, it’s not for others benefit, but primarily yourself. 

And contrary to popular belief, mental illness isn’t a life long thing, even depression comes in 6 months long attacks, and a major depressive disorders, is multiple attacks within a short period of time. 

But the point is don’t run before you can walk, and at the end of the day you can do whatever you want, but it’s just gonna be harder. 

It’s along the same line as someone saying, love yourself before you love other, and that’s unrelated to mental disease per se"
