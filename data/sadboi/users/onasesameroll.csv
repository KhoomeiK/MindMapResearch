My hunch is that if you haven't flossed in two months, it's very likely that you had food built up, particularly at the gums, or if your teeth are tighter together. It really is relative so if you have tighter teeth, more food gets stuck and that could make any even small gap more noticeable once you floss, especially if it has been so long. Also it is important to floss your teeth, but I would focus on the teeth that you use for chewing more than the ones you don't -- and most people don't chew with their front teeth as much as their back and middle. I suggest that you post a photo of the gap you perceive.
