I can understand if your mother doesn't want to take this further (Isuffer from depression myself), but what they've done is absolutely illegal. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if they put a different reason down on file. Gather every bit of evidence you can about the job. How long she worked there, shifts she covered etc because they are likely to lie to find a reason to justify having her sacked. Seek legal advice about this because I feel you have an unfair dismissal/discrimination case here. The care industry really is scummy, my mum works in it too. Don't let these pieces of shit get away with it.

Seriously, my hand went in the water numerous times when wiping. The next thing was complementary tea bags (nice) but no kettle? How can I make a proper brew with no kettle? My tea ended up tasting like coffee because we had to use the coffee machine to get hot water. The last thing that surprised me was how sugary your cereals are. I think I was eating either cheerios or cornflakes. In the UK these are pretty plain with cheerios being on the sweeter side, some people add sugar to cornflakes because the only sweetness is from the milk.

On a more positive side the food is delicious (even if the portions are a bit big, I just feel bad not being able to eat it all) and customer service is excellent. Most people were really friendly and talkative too."

At first the PM said that we should just take it on the chin and gain immunity, which quite frankly that response shocked me with its irresponsibility given the seriousness of this virus and how little we knew about it. Now the response is self isolation like many countries. 

To slow the spread, this seems obviously a good response in my opinion. However a lot of people think this should have been the response at the start. However, I was under the impression that this had to be at the right time. Society can't isolate forever, and from my limited knowledge the disease could just be in reserve in pockets until people started socialising again, allowing it to flare up and overwhelm the health system. So self isolation had to be at the right point along the spread/growth curve and also for the right amount of time. 

Anyone here with more knowledge and expertise who can give an opinion of the UKs response?"

CPTSD,fk0tuxq,t3_ffoau8,1583766027.0,"Same here. University contributed to my trauma (also from an emotionally unregulated and suspected narcassistic mother) through crippling isolation and loneliness. By my second year I thought I had finally made friends, but by the time I graduated I realised they only interacted with me because of obligation (Same society). They didnt actually care about me, and every time I tried to hang out or do something there was always an excuse or drop out last second. This happened on my birthday too. The trauma from uni also meant I only turned up in person a few times. Luckily lectures were posted online so I could catch up on content. It got to the point though where I hadn't turned up for a couple of months but I'm fortunate that my course leader was supportive of getting me back on track and I got adverse circumstances when considering my grade. 

I wish more people were aware that this happens, and I have tried to raise awareness but most people aren't interested because it's an unfortunate and ugly truth for some that is perpetuated by others.

These people aren't interested in helping, they're in it to make themselves feel good. Why else would they say they don't owe you kindness but also that you should give kindness to others in the same sentence? Why else would they do a 180 the moment you suggest that maybe they're not helping or they have it wrong? If you question these types of people or ask for clarification on what they mean they normally can't respond, and will become even crueller. With these people it will never be about how they can make you feel valued as a friend, its about what you can do to stroke their ego. You are only responsible for how you treat others.

Anyone that demands you listen to them otherwise you'll end up alone is not worth your time. Trust me. Cut these people out. I did and while I'm certainly not happy or surrounded by friends, I'm a lot better off.

TwoXChromosomes,ezjb3rv,t1_ezj7sna,1567941751.0,I don't know if I can. He's all I have. The trauma I have from isolation and loneliness will just come back. I just wish I wasn't so dependent.
TwoXChromosomes,ezjaw80,t1_ezj8htr,1567941659.0,Unfortunately I'm in the UK so trying to get help or a therapist is like pulling teeth unless you can afford private.
TwoXChromosomes,ezj7lcc,t1_ezj7208,1567939961.0,My problems run a lot deeper than what self help can fix unfortunately. Ive been on a waiting list since Feb
TwoXChromosomes,ezj6b31,t1_ezj5i8x,1567939335.0,Both 22. Can't afford therapy.
TwoXChromosomes,ezj4rll,t1_ezj4bw7,1567938583.0,I didn't want to jump to it being abuse because it seems a bit excessive. But I feel like the gaslighting and acting as if I'm arguing with him... I dunno it feels wrong
askscience,ez5fmxt,t1_ez5dkti,1567698861.0,Any ideas as to why? And how does this break down for age/sex/orientation? Is it an international trend?
SuicideWatch,eybct8d,t1_eybck0i,1566981346.0,I'm not sure it's a good thing. All i remember is staying up all night on my own playing and I'd hear everyone coming back from their night out laughing and singing with their friends.  I dont remember a night I didnt cry myself to sleep.

SuicideWatch,eybbzji,t1_ey9ybpb,1566980811.0,I prefer video gsmes to be honest
SuicideWatch,ey9cgnb,t1_ey9109b,1566940162.0,"I used to figure skate but stopped going during my final year. My self esteem and lethargy made it difficult to keep going and more i just don't have the money. It was the one sport i ever stuck at for any length of time. But in general i guess there's so much id like to do, but its all making memories with friends that care about me."
SuicideWatch,ey9ca84,t1_ey91p7n,1566940045.0,Even just believing my story is more than anything I've had. So thank you. I dont feel as misunderstood.

SuicideWatch,ey8raeu,t1_ey8hqdi,1566926540.0,"Honestly, I don't have the energy for any type of mental stimulation."
SuicideWatch,ey8r7ja,t1_ey8h68a,1566926488.0,"My resilience? Its waning. I spent years just telling myself to hold on believeing that one day i would get the happiness i wanted. Thats what kept me going. But now that i cannot have that (because i cannot go back in time), my ability to keep it together is diminishing rapidly. I've burnt a lot of bridges and cant bring myself to even care. The cycle will repeat."
SuicideWatch,ey8qusk,t1_ey8fqhp,1566926254.0,"What is so painful is seeing the light that could be in your life dangled like a carrot in front of you. To see the people that could make a difference tell you how wonderful life can be and to tell you to keep holding on is just cruel. Throughout uni i kept trying, i kept holding on and believed the lie that it would get better. I can clearly see a garden full of flowers and colours, yet its locked behind a glass wall."
SuicideWatch,ey8ecfu,t1_ey7xght,1566918136.0,"I just don't understand how people can delude themselves with what they want thw truth to be. It's almost as if the most important thing to them is seeming like a good person and not actually being one. As if the effort is too much but they want the social brownie points of doing so. Time and time again throughout my life, what I have known to be true has fallen upon deaf ears until they cannot avoid and deny the truth any longer. As for the ideation, it's kinda like I'm too afraid to go through with it, but the thoughts are there. I could make little scenarios in my head about how I could die, how the things around me could end me so easily with a bit of creativity. I dont have the plans or the courage to actually do it, but it's not like I'd make the effort to stop it. A good example would be when I crossed the street and didnt look and I got scolded from a bike rider who almost hit me. I couldnt bring myself to care, all I could do was shrug and carry on walking."
SuicideWatch,ey85kmh,t1_ey7x1h8,1566911901.0,"Sure, although I'm not sure how to chat outside of comments."
SuicideWatch,ey7wpj9,t1_ey7wipd,1566903879.0,I honestly don't know what more I could say. I don't know how many iterations of the same story I can give for nothing to change in the end. For no one to just not only listen but believe what I'm saying is true.
UpliftingNews,ey23vv0,t1_ey1yr3x,1566723218.0,In university I was told by a GP that they couldnt help me because I hadn't tried to kill myself yet. Still trying to get help.
depression,es01jr1,t1_es01982,1561462323.0,"It really is. Anyone who's reading this, do what you need to do in order to survive and preserve your health. More often than not these services are shit. The only person we can truly rely upon is ourselves. So let's keep living because it's the only thing we can do. Hopefully some day we can help pave a way for a better service."
depression,erzzri7,t1_ery9r0s,1561460158.0,"Honestly I don't even know what services I've been through. The CBT is through Talking Matters but I've seen GPs, mental health nurses, my uni support officer, my academic advisor. The whole system branching outwards is fucked. Hard to know where you are on your 5th time going around the circle y'know what I mean."
depression,ery5ytc,t3_c4ofz0,1561401179.0,"Tried to get help in my first year of uni and was told by a GP that they can't help me as i hadn't tried to kill myself yet. Fast forward to 3rd year and i fell behind on my work and was put in antidepressants. They didnt really do much and eventually they didnt work at all. Ended up quitting cold, first time because i ran out and couldnt get an appointment. Second time because i was too exhausted and quite frankly couldnt be bothered to register with mt GP at home again. Afger graduation my health took a downturn again and have been put on a waiting list for high intensity CBT since feb. Im not hopeful it's gonna work. I could write a lot more about what an insult the entire system is and how it's more focused on the neurotypicals (I mean people without any mental illnesses) feeling like heroes and patting themselves on the back without actually helping or listening to us. I'm at the mercy of this shit show because i cant afford private."
