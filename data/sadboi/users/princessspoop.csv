bipolar,exzek04,t3_cutoen,1566664860.0,Yes! Every time we do an increase I come down with a 48 hr cold/flu. Every. Time. Its frustrating but it worth it for me. Just hunker down and get some rest!
bipolar,ex8ybm8,t3_crmrz1,1566080584.0,I'm trying to ride that wave out now. This storm of mine is a rough one.
ptsd,euvv4v0,t1_euvt2ro,1564065997.0,It helped me a lot! I realized a lot of my physical symptons stem from my trauma. I thought something else was inherently wrong with me. I learned that my symptoms are normal for what I have gone through.
ptsd,eurxlg0,t3_ch518m,1564000331.0,"Ugh that sucks! Try psychologytoday.com they have a section where you can search for specialists. The types of insurance that each Dr accepts is listed on their profiles. I have Medicaid and I managed to find the ""best fit"" (I refuse to say ""right""). It took what felt like forever to find him. Check the Dr's reviews on google too before you make your appointment. I've managed to dodge a few bullets that way. As shitty as this sounds, it's normal. I wish you the best of luck and I hope that you feel better."
BipolarReddit,eurwnj5,t3_chd6uq,1563999963.0,"I don't know much abouy pristique, but I do know about my own experience with Lamictal. Unfortunately every antidepressant I have tried has increased my mania or has caused severe panic attacks. I have a medical marijuana card too. Sticking with an indica dominate strains help alleviate my anxiety and insomnia. 

I'm bipolar 1 with mixed features. I've been on lamictal for 9 months now. I initially started with 50 mg.  We increased over time very slow. At this point now we have worked myself up to 400 mg. My symptoms (constant disphoric hypomania with suicide ideation) have gradually decreased with time as the lamictal was increased. 400 mg for me seems to do the trick. I don't get nearly as angry, my anxiety has noticeably decreased, and I don't always feel a sense of urgency with impending doom. Every day isn't easy, but it's a lot more manageable. My prescriber is easy to talk with about my symptoms. I have remember to be honest and never downplay my symptoms. My mind loves to play tricks on me and it will say ""it's not /THAT/ bad."" I have to realize bad is still bad and I need help even in the ""not so bad"" situations. It helps to keep a written record of your highs and lows. Also ask the people around you if they notice a difference too. Sometimes even though we don't notice it, our loved ones will. 

I wish you the best of luck in finding the right combo thats works. Be patient. It takes time to find the right mix. Remind yourself that this is only the beginning."
ptsd,eurqsw5,t3_ch8rz8,1563997700.0,"That sucks. I'm sorry that you are going through this.

Your feelings are valid. Processing trauma is not linear. It pops up at the most random times. Usually you don't realize your body is reacting to the trauma while the mind never really focuses on it. (""The Body Keeps Score: Brain, Mind, and Body"" by Dr. Bessel Van Der Kolk is amazing at explaining how the body holds and reacts, or doesnt react, to trauma. It helped put a lot of my trauma behaviors, or lack thereof, into context). He does have a section about EMDR therapy. Its specifically designed to help people process trauma and it has a huge success rate. At the beginning of the process you are learning how to completely trust who is helping you through the EMDR process. They really take the trust part seriously. Without it, the therapy cannot be complete. They will work wirh you to build up the trust with patience. It might be worth a shot to see if a local office offers EMDR. psychologytoday.com or even Google is a wonderful resource for finding someone who specializes in EMDR therapy. 

I wish you the best of luck. Remember to be patient and trust the process."
BipolarReddit,euqdpko,t3_ch6k6f,1563976313.0,"Totally normal, for me at least. My mouth goes off without me realizing it, especially when i am manic. I will usually forget what I said later. But I know it is left field, random, or hurtful. For me, I keep off of most social media (except my recent stumble into reddit). It sounds isolating, but it keeps me worrying more about myself ( I tend to obsess via social media) and less about others. More specifically it prevents me from typing out my random manic ideas. I write them in a journal now. Or I chew my partner's ear off about it. 

Don't obsess too much over what you have said. Try and keep busy, especially physically busy. The physical activity helps mood stability. At least it does for me!

Best of luck!"
BipolarReddit,euqadna,t3_ch67d2,1563974293.0,"I'm right there with you. I'm sorry that you are feeling this way. It can really fucking suck. I'm still waiting for my manic/hypomanic episodes to get ""fun."" It just doesn't happen. They just get more dangerous and scarier for me. Unfortunately I'm hypomanic half the time. What helps me get through the storm is keeping to myself after giving my close loved ones that I interact with on a daily basis a heads up that I'm ""feeling off."" They usually knows what it means if they haven't already got an earful of manic rambling. What helps me alsol is going hard at the gym. I find that I have all this energy that is pent up and eventually misdirected. Forcing myself to focus on physical activity helps. It doesn't help all the time, but it's definitely worth a shot. Writing is great! It keeps your hands busy! Take a look at it when you feel better.

Please take care! Hunker down and ride out the mental storm. Drink some water! Force down a meal! Take a nap if you can if the moment arises. Best of luck through this episode. Message me if you need someone to talk to!"
BipolarReddit,eums4vy,t3_cgkcnv,1563919756.0,"First off: try to remain present and keep connecting with people. People love you. People care about you. The people reaching out on here care for you too! You are important. You are worth it  Suicide feels like the only option, but these feelings are temporary. I promise that this is ALL worth it.

I am so sorry that you are going through this. The pain must be excruciating. I have  a very similar story (f/31, physics major, bipolar, in recovery for substance abuse, suicide attempts agoraphobia and the OCD). I go through disphoric manias often. Sometimes my mind is so full of energy, even though I am nowhere near physically feeling the same, and I just want to die. When I was still in school studying Physics, I felt like my education was the only thing that would keep me going. Until I realized that the deadlines and the growing amount and size of projects were the beginning to one of my many downward spirals. I have crippling amounts of student loans. Sometimes the only option to get rid of this looming impending doom was suicide.

Thankfully I found lamotrigine. I am on a larger dose but it works wonders for me. I am not on an antidepressant as well, since every one we have tried to ""work with"" the mood stabilizer has just made me even more of a mess. I can focus more easily now. I am hoping to go back to school in the fall part time. Exercise helps a bunch too, but you seem to have covered that! And that's awesome!

You will find what will work for you. Be patient. Keep in contact with people. Hell if you need someone to talk to and you feel like no one else understands, you can always reach out to me!

Best of luck. This isn't forever."
ptsd,euml9wa,t3_cgqlvo,1563917183.0,"Oh my goodness the same thing happened to me when I first went back to the gym! Those benches are so frustrating, especially when you are not used to handling them. I had to take 3 months off because I broke my foot during a bipolar rage. I went back to the gym after I got the green light from my doctor. Walking in I already was embarrassed and full of shame. I ran out crying after my fight/sttuggle with the bench. It felt like all eyes were on me.

Since then I have gone back. For me, it's easier to bring a safe person with me. I'm lucky that I have a patient partner who is willing to help when I get frustrated. He's even patient when I am red faced in tears while in public. I'm not 100% ready to go back alone. The last month has been tough trying to stay, but I am happy that I'm sticking it out. 

Exercise is important for me. It helps keep my mood stable. I never want to rage break my foot ever again."
ptsd,eumbgfx,t3_cgugpn,1563913563.0,"Be patient with yourself. Be patient with your partner.

All I know is my own experience. By no means am I trying to say that this is the solution. What I am sharing has helped me tremendously, along with working close with my therapist and being honest and open with my partner. It took time. We have known each other for 12 years and have been together for the last 3 years. 

About 6 months ago, I acknowledged some issues that I have been trying very hard to avoid.  I am a sexual trauma survivor. More specifically I am a covert and overt incest survivor (covert with my father and overt with my brother). So let's just say things are complicated for me when it comes to intimacy.  But working through the trauma and discussing the pain and confusion got me to where I am now.

Out of my own experience I have to remind myself that my partner is safe. He is safe when he is near. He is safe when there is physical contact. He is safe when there is intimacy. It's normal for it to feel good. It is normal for it to feel good with him. My partner says that I am worth the wait and work. I feel the same.

I really hope that you can push through this. Intimacy creates a strong bond between partners. I wish you the best of luck through your healing."
