Advice,fqwakg8,t3_gl9fud,1589697773.0,That is an amazing program idea many children of incarcerated people end up going to jail themselves. I think you should name it after the people it’s. Something like maybe parents behind bars or children of the incarcerated.  If you don’t want to do that you could name it after the goal. You could name it Thrive which I personally think sounds really cool.

Losing a parent like that couldn’t have been easy.
relationship_advice,fpyg9wi,t3_gg6dft,1589003409.0,I would figure out how often you would be comfortable with him coming over. Like maybe once a week or twice a month. They’ll probably still use you as a daycare but it won’t be every day. I wouldn’t recommend this because it probably would Not be good for the kid because he probably like to have a set schedule. But if you don’t want them to make you a daycare randomize the days that way they can’t plan to do other stuff or plan on not having him
dating,fpycixo,t3_gg15lc,1589001291.0,I suggest when you start fighting think about what y’all are fighting about. Talk about it instead of fight and find a solution y’all both agree on. Relationships are about compromise. I can guess most of the arguments is about her want something from you that you don’t want to give or vice versa. But if the fighting continues or the love doesn’t come back then I would consider breaking up I would also suggest trying to find more time to meet up
dating,fpybifu,t3_gg8ksd,1589000539.0,I suffer from a few mental disorders myself I feel like this would be the wrong thing to say but someone who also has or had a mental disorder in my opinion  makes a good partner. I only say that from experience my current boyfriend who has been my only serious boyfriend has PTSD. We work almost perfectly together for the most part. But you shouldn’t go out looking for that because you never know what you might find. My suggestion is to just go slowly. One thing that I’ve noticed is I tend to rattle on about things and I end up overwhelming the person..

If they are minor going to see your general practitioner is fine. That is who is currently prescribing my meds but it’s the reason I went there Because I know they are necessary as I can’t function normally without them because of the depression. But hopefully temporary once I work through the underlying issues with my therapist. I need to go to bed it’s 5am lol
Advice,fo2fh2k,t1_fo2f5s8,1587460391.0,Antidepressants are not really tested for long term use. They are also to be used alongside therapy as well. Antidepressants should be a last resort.

MentalHealthSupport,fo20xd7,t3_g4j1ef,1587446458.0,I don’t necessarily think that she was coerced into doing it. I think you sister might have been really depressed. Her rebellion might have been her trying to get attention wether it was positive or negative. Also you mentioned that your dad recently got deported and that can’t have been easy. I would talk to you sister don’t force her into telling you stuff but let her know you care and that she can tell you anything.
MentalHealthSupport,fo1zw86,t3_g4t522,1587445651.0,I totally understand the feeling of your brain being different I feel it all the time. One thing o would suggest is betterhelp it’s an app that you can download. It’s an online counseling app I get your mom said with the way the world is it’s not a necessity which it absolutely is but if you can get help from the comfort of your own home I don’t see why she would have a problem with it. If your struggling with school I would reach out to your teacher and tell them that you’re having personal issues and that are affecting your work and ask that they be patient or if it’s a specific project ask for an extension. Your teachers should be understanding. From the sounds of things your childhood as been rough I can relate to that. I would look into something called c-ptsd.  If it sounds like something I would choose a counselor with a background in trauma therapy. I actually recently read up on a therapy called EDRM. It’s a therapy for people with ptsd and things like that. If you ever need someone to talk to you can always talk to me I’ll respond.
MentalHealthSupport,fo1ytla,t3_g55hpv,1587444849.0,I don’t know if this can help but in her eyes she doesn’t have a problem. So when she says something that you know isn’t true treated like it is because in her mind it is. if you tell her it’s not real it could make her anxious and more suspicious. I would just sit down and talk to her see what she is seeing or thinking. you have to go to her world. Another thing is if she won’t see a therapist you can see one And ask for advice. I’m am not a licensed therapist or have a degree in psychology but I plan on doing both and keep i keep myself versed on certain mental illnesses.

OCD,fnv631r,t1_fnv5ibg,1587281516.0,Mental illness can make a person lonely especially when surrounded by people. I suffer from much more than OCD. I feel different from other people.

I wouldn’t want to wish this on anyone but at the same time it’s hard being surrounded by people that don’t understand you.

sex,flockey,t3_fq13pt,1585335693.0,You could give in to the desires I grew up religious I have since grown away but my religion was focused on forgiveness ask for it and you shall receive so I would do it and then ask for forgiveness.  what you could do is sort of a kind of behavioral therapy like a punishment that you give yourself for having sexual thoughts or a reward for getting rid of the sexual thoughts or for not giving in to them but if it works you might have to work to reverse it when you’re read I would recommend doing the reward one until you have no problem getting rid of the sexual thought . To help get rid of the sexual thought you could try focusing on something else the only problem is it might make it stronger i would recommend maybe watching a scary movie or reading a scary story maybe try getting into a more negative emotion just temporarily like being scared or sad.

confessions,fg4kk7u,t3_ewqygx,1580505184.0,I have ADHD too I don’t ever get violent though I take Medicine to control it I also have ocd that helps control it as well. I know how hard it can be to try and control your impulses or to focus it’s almost painful to do. I don’t know if you really need a job coach. I think you need to find something that works with your ADHD and not against it. Maybe something like walking a dog that lets your mind wander and it gets you exercise I know it’s not a job you can live off of maybe you can try interior design with good attention to details. I don’t know how well coding would be it requires concentration but maybe you can listen to music that always helps me to focus. Because we have trouble focusing we often notice things that others don’t or notice it faster so if there was a problem with the code you might find it faster than someone else would. I’m sorry I just kinda started rambling if you ever want advice feel free to pm me

relationship_advice,extu3qo,t3_cuephw,1566574812.0,I don’t really have much advice other than what has been brought forth except that you can’t do it alone even though you might want to. I understand how you feel I am damaged from past traumas as well no one really knows how damaged I feel my boyfriend has an idea but it’s just that. I spent years working myself to an okay state a state where I felt comfortable having a relationship where I wouldn’t bring them into this terrible world that I was living. But while you get better the damaged feeling never completely goes away. You’ll get worse a lot worse before you get better. It’s an exhausting process. But on the upside when you are better you’ll feel it because you felt so much pain you can feel so much happiness.

But you don’t get better by fighting alone if you don’t have a therapist I would suggest you get one. And one person you can talk to about things that bother you. There is also medicine that you can take but I would try your other options first. If you don’t have someone your close to that you can talk to about stuff you can always post on This subreddit because I’m sure there are people on here that have gone through similar things or are going through similar things. Just keep fighting and like Eminem said don’t let anyone ever tell you you aint beautiful.   I’m also a huge Eminem Fan I’m a Stan I could talk for hours about Eminem.

depression,erd8bmx,t3_c1hctw,1560733942.0,There is a few things about antidepressants they work but they have some side effects. I was taking Zoloft and it messed with my stomach. But that was just the Zoloft. My recommendation is to research which one they are wanting to put you on.  They also lower sex drive significantly so if you’re in a relationship it might have some adverse effects in that department like not being able to finish and so on. If you start to feel emotionless it might just be the dosage is too high. It might take I while to find the right medication and dosage that works for you. So you need to talk about any and all adverse affects.
