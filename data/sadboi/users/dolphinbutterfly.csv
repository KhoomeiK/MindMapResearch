And about it being exhausting, and feeling like you don't have the strength to keep going through it over and over again. The two things that have helped me through are my Christian faith, and having a really kind therapist who is a loyal companion while I try to put some of the traumas and BPD symptoms of my life behind me. It's a long process, but worth it. At least you have the insight already to know that more of these times will come - I honestly think that you will learn how to deal with them, but you may need a companion to help you face the difficult emotions as you explore why you get triggered by certain things, and what patterns of thinking those triggers set off. Good luck with it all."

Sometimes in desperation for a response and in order to stop myself from texting again and again I make up a pretend response from them that acts as a stop-gap to prevent me from sending yet more anxious messages. It's normally something bland but reassuring ""Hi there, sorry, I've been busy, will get back to you soon."" The funny thing is that when they do actually reply it normally turns out that the ""fake"" response I wrote was pretty accurate!"

To be honest, having it in your medical notes might actually be a nuisance to you in the future, because BPD has a lot of stigma attached to it. I managed to get the letter with my diagnosis removed from my notes many years ago, and am glad that I did. The main thing is that you understand yourself better, and are moving forward. If you want to get better from this, then reading books and finding a good therapist that you click with is the thing.

If you do decide that you really want a professional opinion, then the cheapest option is probably an online psychiatrist.

TrueChristian,fmovhwz,t1_fmk3hqi,1586269287.0,"Hello again. I hope you're doing ok in the crisis too. Your question is an important one that I have often brought before God. On judgement day it seems there will be two essential questions we need to answer: have we accepted that we need for Jesus to be our saviour, and have we made an honest effort to become more and more the person God intended us to be? That is, do we love and accept Jesus, and have we tried to grow in goodness.

The judgement will be about whether or not we tried to move in a good direction, not on what our starting point was, or even what we achieved. Those of us with BPD were dealt a rotten hand both genetically and environment wise, and that is not our fault. God understands our struggles and our distorted ways of thinking better than anyone, and he wants to set us free from them. This will make us happy and him happy too. But it isn't a process that is likely to be completed here on this earth, and maybe on the day I die I will only be halfway to being the mentally healthy, good and loving person that God originally intended. But as long as I have tried, and moved in a better direction throughout my life, and am ready and willing to have God remove all the remaining things in me which are unworthy for heaven, I am confident that it will be ok. Having BPD is very humbling, and that's a good thing in the eyes of God, as long as we don't let it cripple us and cause us to give up."
TrueChristian,flii8sr,t3_fov1t2,1585183086.0,"I really struggle with this too at times, and this is what helps me:

1. I weep with God over the troubles, really allowing myself to feel all the sadness and outrage and then I somehow leave those emotions to him, and leave him to worry about the big picture, and I just trust that he will show me little ways to spread his light in this world of darkness. God is in charge, and we mustn't take worries on our shoulders that belong to him. We are workers in the vineyard while he is the vineyard owner. We are his children, while he is our father. Don't take the worries of the vineyard owner or the fatheron yourself - just trust in him and do what you are directed to do.
2. I remember that this world and all its troubles will not last for ever, and that one day everything will be made well, and all wrongs righted and justice done, and all tears wiped away. Just like films that have awful bits in the middle, but the ending is good, so we are living in  huge epic story of God's banishment of the human race and then the restoration of those who chose him. Right now we are living in the bad part of that story, but the happy ending - for us and also for all God's suffering creatures in this world  - will make the bad part like nothing more than a horrible dream.
3. I remember that this world always has been broken, and always will be until God finally closes it down. That brokenness manifests in different ways in different eras, but when Jesus said ""the poor will be always with you"", this is also true of wrongdoing and suffering in general. This place is not heaven, and it never will be. There are little glimpses of heaven sometimes, but there's a lot of bad things too. I find it helpful sometimes to connect with Christians from different eras, when the problems were different. Those people were very stoical, and understood that life and happiness is fragile - they had, for example, to deal with untimely death a lot more than we do -  and their faith and courage really helps me at times. Old hymns like ""Be still my soul, the Lord is on thy side"" and ""Lead kindly light"" and ""I look to thee in every need"" are about walking with God through the troubles of this world.
4. This might sound weird, but when I really can't handle things and it all feels overwhelming, I have a kind of meditation where I imagine that I am a little child and I fling myself into the arms of my heavenly father, and he holds me to him and I lean on his shoulder and I just let all the worries and pain and grief drift away, while I soak up the warmth and comfort and security of his love. This is very powerful for me, and when I've rested in God's arms like this for a while I feel like I have really put down the burden and gained peace, and then I am a lot calmer and much better able to cope and carry on. It's weird that I can do this, because I had a very difficult childhood, and never had that experience of being able to throw myself into the comforting arms of a parent who loves me, but yet I am able to bring this image to mind very powerfully, I generally lie down or curl up on the sofa with my eyes closed while I do it. Anyway, give it a try because it may help you too."

I have been watching youtube videos on anxiety all afternoon. Exercise to the point of exhaustion can help, as can a sudden temperature change - face in cold water, or even a cold shower. Writing about it, especially if you can use a lot of detail. Deep, calm breathing which tricks your body into feeling things are ok. Trying to focus on something in the here and now rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. And laughter.

BPD,fjf9eh7,t3_fcrk13,1583287086.0,"I have battled suicidal thoughts on and off for my whole life. While other people self-harm I contemplate suicide. I have several attempts behind me too. I feel so stupid after I've had a bout of thinking about suicide and have decided yet again that I won't do it. It feels like such a stupid waste of time. But then a few weeks or months down the line I will find myself looking into the abyss again, and thinking about how it would be so much better for everyone if I was dead - which my rational mind knows isn't true.

It almost doesn't help that I'm a Christian and believe that heaven will be wonderful - it can make it harder at times to see any point in staying here and struggling. I am trying at the moment to strengthen my resolve to stay here and be of use, and find what happiness I can. 

Sorry to hear that Reddit deleted your post by the way. That must have felt very hurtful. And it's not what you need when you are feeling down.

And I like what you say about being considerate towards other people and realising that it's very hard for them, and that they don't have such robust mental health themselves that they can cope with endless amounts of negativity. For myself, I've felt very frustrated in situations where I know that if the other person would just stop telling me to stop feeling bad, and would acknowledge and accept my pain, I would be able to move on so much faster. The more we feel told that we can't feel this way, the more bad we feel. But then it can get into a vicious circle....

  I think BPD is at times only one step away from multiple personality disorder, or as it is now called dissociative identity disorder.

BPD,fj3ntfb,t3_fb9fsd,1582988877.0,"I had a panic attack back in May brought about by a loud YouTube video that started playing randomly just after I had watched something else. And around the same time I had a really crazy moment in the airport where I suddenly realised what it must be like to have Asperger's. The noise, and all the faces of the people rushing past me were just more than I felt I could handle, and I was seriously worried about collapsing on the floor (that's one of the things that happens to me when I get overloaded). I solved it by just looking out for the very little children and focusing on them - the process of looking for them gave my brain something to do other than panic, and somehow their sweet little faces, unperturbed by all the chaos brought me a sense of peace.

I think sometimes we people with BPD become like babies ourselves - unable to handle loud noises and overstimulated by chaos. I've heard this described as ""emotional flashbacks""  - returning to a very young state of mind or a state of mind when we experienced a trauma. If these states we return to are very young and pre-verbal there may be no verbal or even pictorial memory associated with them - just the raw emotion. This helps me to make sense of it a bit and not feel like I'm just going totally insane!"
BPD,fj3l13e,t3_fba117,1582986756.0,"I've had times in my life when I felt exhausted and battle-weary too. And I can relate to your feeling that the thing which picks you up the most is the sense of being truly understood and cared about by someone. I remember at one of my really low points when every day seemed like a struggle, I had a really sweet GP whose secretary would always find a slot for me if I rang up sounding desperate and unhappy. I used to just sit in his office and cry and see his kind caring face looking at me like he was really sad because I was hurting so much. We talked together of course, but what I remember most of all is just the loving way he looked at me, and the gentle pat on my shoulder as I left. At one point he really wanted me to go on anti-depressants, which I didn't want to do, and I said to him ""YOU are my medicine"" - and it was true. Half an hour of feeling really cared about and understood recharged my batteries for a month or more. It also helped that he had been physically abused by his father, so he could relate to that part of my life.

Anyway, I do understand, and I'm glad you reached out here. There is a lovely free online ""listening"" site I came across the other day, called 7 cups, which I think could be a great help to people here who feel lonely - perhaps you might want to keep it in mind for really desperate moments. But I think the amount of pain that you are feeling comes from something very deep down inside which was probably planted at a very young age, and which needs therapy from a compassionate and gentle therapist in order to heal. And please don't feel bad that your pain seems illogical and to make no sense:  somewhere deep inside is a reason for this, and your pain is a natural response to that, and certainly not something you should feel guilty or bad about. None of us here can help the fact that we are broken vessels. None of us asked to be this way. And one good thing is that we all want to change and heal and can help one another. I hope you feel better soon and get lots of support here."

But I do have my son and ex-husband living in the same house. If I was living on my own I think it would be too isolating.

I also worked as a nanny for a while - loved it! Sweet little children to play with, and no need to think about work whilst not there. Turn up, look after a baby/toddler/child all day and have lots of fun, and then go home. The downside of that was that it didn't pay much."
BPD,firtz67,t3_f9hnxd,1582671195.0,"Just the fact that you recognize that your behaviour is hurtful and counterproductive to your relationship is a really good starting point. With the desire to put this kind of stuff behind you I'm sure that you will manage to in time. As far as advice or tips go: I think separating yourself from your boyfriend temporarily when you feel like that may help you to calm down and think a little more rationally about it all. Going into another room and just writing for a while about how you feel might help with this - geting it all down on paper can be a good way to give yourself permission to feel things without taking it all out on your boyfriend and saying or doing the first thing that comes into your head. Having it written down also means that you can look back over it later and maybe gain some insight into what lay behind the meltdown. If you really don't feel like writing, then just going outside for a while might help too. Also, having some firm rules about what you are and aren't allowed to do during arguments can help you to avoid the most hurtful aspects - like you aren't allowed to threaten self-harm of call him nasty names. And finally, phrasing things as ""I"" messages.... ""I feel really scared when you say that"" rather than ""You're making me feel bad"" helps both of you to recognize that the problem is at least partly in your interpretations of things, not necessarily in the external facts of the case.

Be patient with yourself, and don't expect miracles overnight. But trust that in time you can develop healthier patterns. And good luck!"
BPD,firsjo1,t1_firqz8w,1582670465.0,"Well, I do agree with you about it being unrealistic to think that we will ever be completely better in this world. But I think we can move into a much better place with our health and mental health. And that's all that ""normal"" people have isn't it. The only truly mentally healthy person who walked this planet was Jesus (from my Christian viewpoint).

Identity confusion is horrible. But again, from a Christian perspective, God your creator knows who you are and can help you to become that person. Lots of Christian songs talk about putting ourself into God's hands to be made into what we were supposed to be - with the understanding that becoming what God meant us to be will bring us joy and a sense of finally having arrived. I have had a line from a Christian song echoing in my head for the last week ""Let me become what you would choose to make me"". I used to be scared that handing myself over to God would mean losing myself, but I see more and more that it means finding myself. This probably sounds weird!  I do think that therapy, and above all, God's love, can bring us much more than just symptom management. I think the deep longing in our hearts for security, love, and identity can be filled"

It sounds like you are moving in a healthy direction, and understanding yourself better and learning to cope a little better with life. I would suggest getting into therapy if you can, and allowing yourself to attach to your therapist as an FP. This may sound counter intuitive, but it will take the pressure off your day to day relationships, and with the therapist you have the chance of being in a secure relationship that nurtures and supports you and gives you the chance to face up to some of your anxieties and insecurities. I think a good therapist that is loving and non-judgmental and kind can become a source of positive messages and love (in a platonic sense) that helps you to fill the love tanks inside you that are constantly running on empty, and helps you to have a bit more of a sense of lovableness and self-worth, and learn to internalise some of the comfort and validation that you need. It is a lot to ask of a boyfriend for them to deal with huge amounts of insecurity and need for validation, and to cope with extreme emotional outbursts and suicide threats. I've imposed this on people in the past, and looking back I think I did them a lot of damage with it. Now I keep the crazy stuff to talk about with my therapist-friend, and try to behave more considerately in everyday relationships."

BPD,firn7z0,t3_f910qd,1582667588.0,"I've suffered from thoughts like this too. I think it comes from a very early time when we blamed ourselves for turmoil in the relationships around us, concluding that we are the problem. And I think the answer is perhaps to allow yourself to return to that simple state of mind and to feel reassured in that state that you are ok, that you are loved, that you are wanted and valued and precious. I do this by imagining myself in the arms of a loving parent, or sleeping as a little child on the shoulder of someone who loves me. I just let the worries disappear and soak up that love. For me, as a Christian, there is a deep truth in this imaginary scenario, because God really does love each of us like that - simply because we are his.  Our deepest need as humans is for this kind of love that wants and cherishes us just because we are us - totally independent of any valuation. People who have been loved deeply like this by their parents are very resilient to outside disapproval. But even if we didn't get a strong sense of this when we were little, I think we can build it bit by bit, If you find it hard to imagine yourself being loved so totally and unconditionally, find some photos online of parents hugging little children, and tell youself that you are loved as much as that little child. Hope this helps!"
BPD,firlzf2,t3_f918od,1582666914.0,"Maybe the answer is that people don't divide into those who are totally trustworthy and those who are not. People are a mixture of good and bad, and it's wise to be a little cautions at first, but to allow one's trust to increase as time goes by and a true bond develops. I wish I had taken this advice in my own life, because I have been far too trusting and at times got badly hurt. I wanted to trust people so much that I ignored warning signs and allowed myself to be in dangerous situations.

Anyway, you sound like you are on a complicated journey with all of this, but you sound like a lovely person who is trying to move in a good direction. Good luck with it."
BPD,fiqr3zr,t3_f98ck0,1582650184.0,"I think there is a lot of truth here, and it's good to realise that our sensitivity and vibrancy can indeed make us lovely people. But also as [aamoyg](https://www.reddit.com/user/aamoyg/) below points out, there are some factual errors, most notably that we always come out alive. 10% of people with BPD end up dying from suicide, and even those who don't kill themselves overtly are statistically speaking likely to live significantly shorter lives than people without BPD, due to having a much higher risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer.

I think our aim needs to be to get mentally healthy, but to retain the insights, empathy and will to live that we developed as a result of having BPD. IF we can retain the aspects that make us lovable and fun to be with, and lose the nasty, fearful, clingy and at times aggressive or self-hating side, we can truly be lovely people who bless those around us."
BPD,fiq51b3,t1_fdpgyoh,1582635312.0,"I just realised that I never replied to this. I thought I had. I'm really sorry not to have done.

How are you now? I can relate to what you wrote here about having times when you feel confused, scared and embarassed. I find it sad sometimes to reflect on what I""might"" have been if I hadn't been mentally ill, and to know that my poor children have had to grow up with a mother who has some serious problems - but even so, I do know that in some ways I have been a good mother, and a blessing to them. I certainly haven't screwed them up as much as my parents did to me.

 You honestly sound like a lovely person who wants to find peace and good mental health and be a good mother and wife and friend etc, and I'm sure that you already have been, even with your problems. Realising that we have BPD can be a wonderful turning point, because finally we have map for understanding why we have the issues we do, and how we might go about dealing with them. It's a journey, but one that will really lead us to better places, and although there are moments when it feels too much, and we wonder if we'll ever see real progress, there are other moments when we realise that we've been making progress and are slowly unpicking the web of fears and distorted ways of thinking and unhealthy patterns that have influenced our behaviour for so long.

If you want to talk more, email me on [petra@plucien.net](mailto:petra@plucien.net), and we'll stay in touch that way. Again, sorry for not replying a month ago when you wrote this. And thank you for your good wishes - I send mine to you as well."
TrueChristian,fiq3aop,t1_fipoe2p,1582633691.0,"I am praying that you feel God at your side on this journey towards healing and wholeness. I'm sorry that you had a crazy week and have been feeling low - I know how hard that can be, but God sees your desire to grow in health and holiness, and he is pleased and will guide you gently into new pastures.

I have been finding recently that fictional writing is often an easier way to express my thoughts and dig deep to the heart of problems than just writing prose accounts of what is in my head. For example I have a whole series of stories going where a little 5 year old version of me plays with and talks to my kind therapist friend, and those conversations and interactions throw up some amazing insights as well as being very healing. It may be worth a try. C S Lewis expressed some of his most profound insights through fiction, and St Ignatius encouraged us to use our imaginations to enter into encounters with Jesus in prayer, and I have done this too. Anyway, your heart and the Holy Spirit will guide you!"
BPD,fihi3f9,t3_f7ph0p,1582410605.0,Good tips. Thanks for sharing them.
BPD,fihhozu,t3_f7wkwl,1582410442.0,"It  wasn't very nice of your therapist to suggest that things might get worse as you get older. They might get better, and indeed are likely to! Borderline personality disorder tends to get better over time as people develop more insight and strategies to deal with it. You sound like you are going through a rough patch at the moment, but things will improve. Just hang on in there, and don't beat yourself up. You didn't ask to have problems, and you don't choose to have them now, so none of it is your fault. I remember when I was a teen, very very unhappy and at times suicidal. Well life hasn't been a bed of roses since then, but I'm basically pretty happy with my life today, and have lots of lovely memories to look back on. Try to stay positive, and expect things to improve over time."
BPD,figpbtf,t1_fignvko,1582402218.0,"What I meant about my therapist being human is that I try to bear in mind that he has a limit somewhere, and I don't want to push him beyond it. He's been very tolerant of text messages, but at one point, after I had sent him an avalanche of messages over one weekend, he did say he felt we needed to cut back - this is when I made myself the rules. I think it's great that yours lets you text as much as you want and replies to some of your messages. I'm actually thinking of becoming a therapist, and this is one of the things that scares me a bit."
BPD,figo16m,t1_fif325g,1582401918.0,"Those actually sound like good strategies - thinking about what is best for them and realising that giving them some space is the most loving thing to do at a certain point, and then writing something you don't send. I think we should feel proud of ourselves when we manage to do this, because let's face it, it's really hard to do."
BPD,figngbj,t1_fidj4m7,1582401716.0,"Your therapist sounds really nice. Mine is very kind about me texting too, but I made some rules for myself to try to avoid texting him every single day, because he is only human."
BPD,fi83mxa,t3_f6m8xz,1582232831.0,"This is good advice. I have been far too trusting of people in my life, and ended up being hurt in all kinds of ways."
BPD,fi7qwxg,t1_fi6i1qj,1582226524.0,"I agree with you about CBT and DBT being more about making you into a 'easier' person rather than addressing your core pain. This can feel quite insulting and dismissive, especially CBT. I've been watching some videos on transference focused psychotherapy and mentalisation therapy for BPD, and that appeals to me a lot more, But I do think it's worth picking up any little bits and pieces from the DBT books that might be helpful.

Here's a link to a video of a demonstration of a transference focused psychotherapy session. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14fW-VUiCQA&t=705s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14fW-VUiCQA&t=705s)"
BPD,fi3fzdr,t3_f64qxv,1582116928.0,"I'm sure you are not monstrous and evil. Those are her words echoing in your ears, and tempting you to hate yourself and give up. I have broken more and more free from my mother's terrible verdict of me as I have reclaimed myself as a child of God, made in the image of someone loving and kind., and claimed Jesus as my redeeemer, brother and friend. It's still a struggle sometimes, but the truth is that all of us, you included, were made for happiness and for goodness, and for life. I hope you feel better soon, and that some positive mother-type people come into your life to give you a sense of who you truly are."
TrueChristian,fi3elku,t1_fhxzwdc,1582114144.0,"Sorry to take a while to reply. I wanted to think/pray about this. For the first question, I think problems like BPD exist on many levels. All illnesses are ultimately spiritual in origin, but this doesn't mean that we can just say a prayer and it is all gone. Each of us has certain weak spots, both physically and emotionally, and the devil attacks us in those, causing some people to become alcoholics, and others to suffer from depression, and others to end up with BPD or with an auto-immune disease. As well as kicking out the problems, we need to heal the weaknesses that allowed them to take hold in the first place. Biblically speaking this would mean casting out the evil spirits and filling ourselves up with the Holy Spirit, so that the bad things can't get back in. But it's a process, and often a long and difficult one which won't even be finished here on earth. And a lot of love is needed along the way - God's love and human love.
This brings me to your second question: really, a good strategy while you are in a fragile state of trying to build yourself better mental health, would be to stay away from your father. One day you may well be robust enough to cope with being around his behavior, but right now it seems that being with him knocks you right down and causes you to lose the ground you had gained. That in itself will get very depressing after a whle. If avoiding him isn't possible, then maybe some kind of visualization of the behavior he might engage in beforehand could help.... and then writing about it afterwards to try to get it out of your head and neutralize its effect. If you are going to grow into being all that God wants you to be, then maybe you will need to pull back from him for a while, and feel ok about that. To be honest, this last year I haven't seen a lot of my mother for similar reasons to you. I have felt bad about it at times, but then remind myself that she has plenty of friends and a good social life, and she doesn't really ""need"" me. And I definitely need to be away from her, and so does my younger son, who is hypersensitive to criticism. Jesus told us that anyone who loves ""mother, father, sister, brother..."" more than him isn't worthy to enter the kingdom. And this includes allowing relationships with family to destroy your mental health and prevent you from growing into what God wants you to be. Let the Holy Spirit guide you about how to show some love to your father whilst seeking healing and a protected space in which to allow God to transform you into His vision for you.
Hope this helps!"

BPDlovedones,fi1by9j,t1_fi0v4z0,1582054699.0,"I think rules are the way to go here. Then when a crisis arrives you can call on the rule which you both agreed upon when she was ""sane""!"
BPD,fi0s29h,t1_fi0jwdh,1582043622.0,"I think what you wrote here is very true. I was just thinking this afternoon that my father's violence and obvious craziness made me angry and gave me a determination to get out of this awful home and live a happier life. But my mother's constant nasty messages ""You're ugly, useless, not good enough ..."" those were the things that drove me to suicide attempts and despair. It's easy to know you are being mistreated when someone beats you up when you've done nothing wrong. But when you are bombarded with negative messages it's really hard not to internalise them."
BPD,fhukhej,t1_fhrm0bj,1581887330.0,That definitely puts a different perspective on it.

BPD,fhmwgg6,t3_f3upbe,1581718911.0,"I know how it feels when you made a little request that you didn't feel would be a big deal, but then the response or lack of it makes you very emotional and upset, and you end up wishing you had never asked because it just wasn't worth the stress! And then you feel bad because you brought it all on yourself, and maybe you could have ""known"" how it might end up.  All I can say is that it''s good to think over these things, as you have been doing, and it will help you to evaluate the situation differently another time. And if you are worried about having manipulated him unintentionally that just shows that you are a nice person who doesn't want to manipulate people, and with time you will get better at understanding yourself and avoiding situations which are liable to set you off! We've all done stuff like this."
BPD,fhmazm7,t3_f3q1zr,1581710478.0,"You sound in a lot of pain, and I'm really sorry to hear that. It's good that you posted here, as we all understand how rotten it can feel at times. When I feel really low like that I remind myself that God loves me and will never leave me. This does help a lot, as do songs such as ""You are mine"" by David Haas. You can find it on youtube. For me, feeling God's love is the foundation of my life, and then human love is something wonderful on top of that, but not so necessary. I really hope you manage to get on top of your work, and that you feel better soon. And don't forget to go outside at least once a day for some sunshine and fresh air - you sound like you are on top of sleeping, showering and eating, but maybe exercise isn't so much on your agenda. God bless you friend!"
BPD,fhm9b7l,t3_f3rjai,1581709888.0,"It sounds like you've been stuck in this way of seeing things for a while, so I won't say that it will get better overnight.

I pray that something turns around for you soon, and that some spark of joy comes to you in some way."
BPD,fhm8a7z,t3_f3hrkz,1581709590.0,"Yes, when we feel really bad inside it's hard to understand that other people really don't know about that. It feels like we have a label on our forehead saying ""I feel terrible, please be kind to me"", and it's hard to understand how people don't notice, or pretend not to notice.  And sometimes even when we try to tell them in words they still don't really get it, which makes it worse. Well, it would be lovely if people could just read our minds, and us theirs, but the reality is that communication is clumsy and sometimes hurtful. Again, like a lot of BPD things I think this desire for people to just understand without us having to spell it out goes back to unmet needs of early childhood, when we literally had no words to express ourselves and were dependent on caregivers to pick up on the non-verbal cues. But just realising that we are expecting people to be mind-readers can help us to not be so demanding of them, and be a bit more understanding in our turn about them failing to notice how sad we were."
BPD,fhm6uzo,t3_f3t9yr,1581709130.0,"These days when you are ""supposed"" to be happy, and everything is supposed to be all perfect and loving pile on a lot of extra stress. So it's not surprising that things went wrong. I think you just need to let yourself start over... say you are sorry, and try to enjoy what is left of the day in a low-key, low stress way. And know that you aren't the only one who ends up in an argument on a day when you wanted everything to be nice - it's very common over Christmas too. I hope your day gets better, and that your leg heals up. And don't beat yourself up about the self-harm. Focus on the positive side that it's been ages since you did this. It was just a single slip up, and you can put it behind you and move on."
BPD,fhm61g1,t3_f3t1t4,1581708784.0,"That is so sad. I hope you find someone else soon. That will probably be the best healer of all. In the meantime, rejoice in happy memories with your husband and with others, and if you are a Christian, try to draw closer to God. The more secure you can feel inside yourself the less desperate you will be in a new relationship, and the more likely it is to work out."
BPD,fhm5ah6,t3_f3vbjz,1581708562.0,"CBT isn't great for BPD anyway. And the relationship between you and the therapist is often the most important factor. So if you find a nice therapist who you get along with, it is almost bound to help. Check out some videos on transference focused psychotherapy to see what I mean about the relationship being important."
BPD,fhkhzuk,t3_f3m6f7,1581684068.0,"This was sweet.... and tragic. It brings home to me how much the fp obsession is like the way a very tiny child feels about their closest relationship.  Just look at photos of little babies staring adoringly into the eyes of someone they love. I think those of us with BPD never experienced this magic safe wonderful feeling when we were tiny, and something in us longs to experience it now. And so we put one person after another up on that pedestal, only to have them tumble because our rational brain sees their flaws, and then we feel angry with them for ""abandoning"" us by not being the perfect person we thought they were.

Maybe the love isn't entirely false - it's just coming from a very primitive place. Anyway, thanks for sharing this."

I look forward to geting your update when you've lost the next 20, and wish you good luck with reaching your target for June as well. Slow and steady is good, by the way.

BPD,fhc6qws,t1_fhc3mcx,1581457327.0,"I would say just try to treasure and hang on to positive and loving memories from throughout your life - think about people with whom you felt secure and safe, and try to let those memories stay alive in you. With time you can build an inner core of security that isn't so dependent on what is happening right now. Then you can experience the joy of being with people without feeling devastated and anxious when they aren't there. I think that we people with BPD or with BPD traits never really learnt to feel safe and secure when we were little, and so in some ways have remained like small children, wanting to be constantly clamped to the side of someone who makes us feel good. But we can gradually learn to carry a little of that security around inside us, and let the rational side of us calm down and reassure the terrified emotional side of us. It's a goal to be worked towards, but having the insight and ability to reflect that you already have is a big step along the road already!"
TrueChristian,fhb2wnh,t3_f1ylug,1581433582.0,"Love and compassion are great, but it was pride and disobedience that led to us being separated from God, and we need to turn to God in humility and accept HIS way for us to go to heaven, not think that we somehow have deserved it. Yes, we must long for goodness, and aim to be pure and full of love. But we also have to humbly accept that we fall short of that, and that we need a saviour. Not one of us is good enough to earn our way into heaven - we will receive it as an unearned gift through Jesus, or we won't receive it at all.

It is worth noting that the first commandment is ""You shall have no other gods before me"", or as Jesus put it ""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and strength."" It is love for God, which means accepting HIS plan for our salvation that will save us."

TrueChristian,fhb1n4k,t1_fh8cutm,1581432728.0,"Hello. I'm glad my previous reply was of use.

Verses that help.... here are some:

""Before I formed you in the womb I chose you ..."" Jeremiah. Claim this for yourself: you belong to God, your creator, before anyone else. That is your deepest and truest identity, as a child of God, made in his image and likeness.

""Be assured I am with you always,..."" words of Jesus. You are not alone!

""Those who trust in the Lord will find their strength renewed...."" This verse assures us that even when we fall down and get worn out, we will rise up again in God's strength.

""The promise he has made us is Eternal Life."" It's worth remembering that Jesus didn't promise us an easy time in this world. In fact he said ""In this world you will have trouble."" But he did promise that the last page of our story here is a good one... we will be welcomed into Eternal Life with him in a place where ""There will be no more tears, or suffering or crying.""

I'll send some more verses another time. You can look up the references to these online.

About splitting: when that temptation arises to see someone as bad or uncaring or nasty, I try to recognise that it is the devil tempting me with those thoughts, and I reach out to God with the question ""Lord, how do you want me to see this?"" This can help me to act in a way that is decent and kind even if I am feeling unhappy or annoyed or that I want to pull away. I try to hang on to the three words ""Truth, Faith and Love"" throughout all my interactions, and when I do things go well.  Sometimes I am tempted to be unloving, or to feel despair, or to misrepresent what someone has said, but I try to have these three words hold me on track. I also remember that Jesus was kind and loving and thought of others even on his way to the cross, so I really have no excuse for being nasty to people. And like I say, God can help us to get our heads into the right place about someone if we really want to do that.  If we want to be good and loving people God is pleased about that, and will help us to move more and more in that direction. As people with BPD we have certain weaknesess that the devil will try to exploit, but oike it says in the Bible ""resist the devil, and he will flee from you"".."

If you can handle at least some of your emotion alone it will help take the pressure off your friends. Maybe a comforting meditation might help - imagining being held in the arms of someone who loves you - or a soft toy, especially one given to you by your friend 2, and which you can hug to feel a connection with him. Or a book of nice photos that cheer you up and make you feel good - or a page of lovely messages that you received from your friend or from other people. These kind of strategies won't reduce your discomfort to zero, but they might pull it back to a level where you can think more rationally about the pros and cons of reaching out. But don't expect the people around you to understand how much self-control you have shown by not phoning or texting endlessly - to them it's normal to stay calm!!!"

For me it started the day I was born, when my mother thought I wasn't brown enough to her liking (she'd married an Indian man partly because she liked the idea of brown kids) and she put me out in the sunshine as a very young baby to brown me up. Several years on it was ""Why can't you be more like....."". My parents always seemed to think other people's children were wonderful, and my brother and I were the worst kids on earth.

The best thing that works for me is just remembering that I belong to God before I ever belonged to anyone else, and he doesn't judge me against other people, and doesn't think I'm inadequate. He is just happy that I love him. I try to get into the mindset of a very young child who doesn't compare themself to others, but just is happy to be cared about and to be in that loving relationship with their parent. Comparisons are toxic, whether you come out well or badly."
BPD,fggm96t,t3_eybqnm,1580764804.0,"Try the DBT workbook. And maybe even find a therapist of some kind you can discuss it with. CBT isn't great for borderlines anyway, and it was because it was failing that DBT was invented. I had some sessions of CBT many years back, when I was first hospitalised as a suicide risk. The psychiatrist wasn't nice at all, and the sessions were just him telling me how the way I thought was stupid, and how I should think differently. I quit going after a few sessions because it was upsetting me too much.

The NHS stinks for mental health I'm afraid. Private care or trying to help yourself with workbooks etc may be your only option for a while.

Where in the UK are you based. I am near Cambridge."
BPD,fg6kevt,t3_ex53ph,1580570316.0,"If your instinct is not to see her again, then maybe you should take that seriously. You've been through enough emotional pain due to her already, and she clearly doesn't understand or care in the way that she ought to. You don't owe her anything, so just follow your own feelings on this one.

I do hope you find another therapist, and that somehow you can protect yourself against this kind of thing in the future. Don't give up on finding help... 

On a weird note, when I realised how very attached I am to my therapist I kind of ended up creating an imaginary version of him, and this imaginary version is available 24/7 and will always be there for me if I end up not seeing the real one for some reason. There are times when I feel more able to share with the imaginary one than the real one, to be honest, but that's ok. I still really like the real one, but the imaginary one is safe and permanent. Not saying this would work for everyone, but it's been really good for me, and means I can let my heart be as attached as I want without the fear of it getting broken."
BPD,fg6443d,t1_fg5lm41,1580552600.0,"Your therapist sounds very insightful and understanding. Has he/she written any articles that you know of?

I think that phrase ""perfectly unrejecting"" hits the nail on the head. If I feel a close emotional connection with someone then I can be hypersensitive to them disagreeing with me or (God forbid) suggesting that it would be good if I took a different perspective on something hurtful that happened to me. It feels like total rejection of me - they hate me, I'm worthless, I might as well kill myself... no one understands or cares, everything that happened to me was my fault and I deserve it, I 'm a nasty worthless person etc. etc. 

I'm more and more coming to see that this anxiety about my value is right at the heart of my ""issues"". If you felt able to pm me the name of your therapist I'd really appreciate it."
BPD,fg1ntc2,t3_ewco5x,1580430475.0,"If you relate to all the BPD symptoms, then don't let the fact that you have not been officially diagnosed with it stop you from benefiting from seeing yourself from that perspective. Self-diagnosis isn't a bad thing, and often these days it seems that with mental and physical health people can search the web and find out before the doctors do what they have.

The important thing is what is helpful to you.... And sorry to hear about the tiredness. It sounds very difficult, and I hope it improves for you."
BPD,fg1mxjl,t3_ewbtsd,1580430001.0,"You need to be kind to yourself like you would be to someone else. What would you say to another person? And you need to remember that what matters most is what is inside you. The loveliest people in my life have been people who weren't ""classically"" beautiful. I think when people are very attractive in a conventional sense then they get so much approval that they don't need to bother to be nice on the inside, but people who are less conventionally attractive have to value themselves for something deeper. 

Anyway, I hope you get through this!"
BPD,fg1e0dn,t3_ewb35d,1580425422.0,"Wow, that's a lot of troubles to deal with all at once. But it's really positive that you are working and going to school. You can feel justly proud of that, and know that you are on a good path. Your life can be better, and in time you can disconnect from family members that  drain your emotional energy. Just hang in there, and try to look for coping methods that don't harm your body, and that will truly help you, not just numb the pain. Finding  a therapist sounds like a good idea too, as someone else suggested. Anyway, don't give up. And keep posting here!"
ageregression,fg1c125,t1_ffz8sap,1580424466.0,Pictures can be very powerful. I'm glad you could relate to the idea.
ageregression,fg1btwc,t3_erppkr,1580424358.0,"I'm sorry to read your post just now. I hope you have found a way to feel better, and are settling back into college. Take care of yourself."
