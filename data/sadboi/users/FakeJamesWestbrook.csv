Exactly, all these fat loser, White Amerimutts complaining about 'muh white woman!!' ar idiots, because interracial sex has been happening since the inception of an America, it's happened so much so, about 48% of White Americans are 'part African' in America, hence them tanning and the 'sickle cell anemia' and everyone claiming they're 'part Italian or Native American or Greek"" etc.. with no fucking idea where they come from.

&#x200B;

Read book, interracial sex was so common in America, Hitler called America a ""Mixed mongrel, negrified race, with part British, Welsh, polish, etc.. people and they were due' extermination for being 'mixed like dogs', go read ""Mein Enkampf"" excerpts, when America realized his plans for America, they decided to join the war.

Also, were more about the 'designation of white' due to 'color' and not national or ethnic roots, in fact, Americans are so mixed already(many of these Amerimutt racists) that they have sickle anemia is about 40% of Americans, which can only come from African genes.

&#x200B;

There is a reason why European nations have the 'La Creatura"" meme, as they laugh at Alt-Right retards calling everything communism or 'race mixing', when to people from Britain, Switzerland, Ice Land, Ireland, Danes, etc.. Consider Americans 'mongrels and mutts' and laugh at this 'white purity' bullshit, as they don't consider Americans 'pure' anything, at all. They consider Americans far from it, and laugh at the absurdity of claiming 'racial purity' at all, there is a reason you're called Yanks, and Amerimutts.

The stupidity with this is staggering, lack of history, reading losers blogs, and people that don't know history, and just 'make it up' to fit their narrative, and it's pathetic

Hey, Alt-Right idiots that jerk off to Hitler, ""HITLER would've gassed you, for your mongrel genes"" Fact.

You can now withdraw more than 10,000 in a check, and would have to buy another check, etc.. as to 'verify where funds came from' which is insanely intrusive, and will be marked for your taxes, when corporations can 'go around it' or friends of the banks etc.. can.


With the ""patriot act' they made 'intrusiion' legal, so over-reaching what the government can record, or what devices they can commission. Such as your 'phone automatically' recording you(they used to not be able to do that), or ""facebook"" having to forkover your comments or database to the government under the guise of the ""patriot Act'.

The police force went from those with a gun, to literally a f*cking army, with army fatigue, bigger guns, etc... everyone looks like the swat team, and they've had 'armored tanks' on the ground in civilian areas, not commissioned by the military.

Now, due to 9-11, the fear of 'government personal saftey' took over, over serving the citizens. It used to say ""To Protect and Serve"" but now that our cops are militarized it says, ""Law Enforcement"" which is a different conotation, and now how if you don't 'comply' immediately, you can be 'shot dead' to have idiot White Amerimutts cheer it on, and defend it, until it's little ""Johnny or Suzy"" and now it's unfair, now it's, ""Don't Tread on Me"", while they don't realize, the law is for ""ALL PEOPLE"" and though they abirtarily enforce it, when they want, they will 'enforce it'with impunity, etc...

I recall I was in high school, when it happened, I recall our English teacher(good guy, but eccentric, but not racist at all) like apologizing to our buddy about the way he was and probably being 'treated' in society after it, as well as bringing up it was wrong to our entire 'Senior English class"" and I didnt' realize how much it was probably affecting his life.

I recall the guy had a 'white Amerimutt' girlfriend at the time, which I was like 'meh' about, but afterwords, I guess she was getting shit about being with him, and I realize now, he'd always say that, ""Yeah it's fucked, but Aremenians are cool"" as some of the White Amerimutt loser kids that every school has the ""Eric Cartmann"" types will use the racial hierarchy and racism to get digs at minorities or to elevate their status as 'losers' with race, though the upper middle class or rich kids still looked at them like shit, they still allowed them to be 'racist' to certain groups on some, 'Well he has his opinion' bullshit.

I stood up against it, because I'd been used to racial digs going to school with those white Amerimutt kids since 5th grade, after I left Catholic school, but, damn.. I looking back, he must  have been so shocked at it.

After that, I noticed he was a lot more compassionate to the few black and African kids at our school, who would get 'shit' too, it was fucked.

I recall that vividley, teachers openly saying how 'certain people shouldn't be in our country' and at the time, teachers could like do nothig wrong, sabotage a minority, who cares? and it got worse after 9/11.

So, i disagree with this person's assertion, comparing this to the Halocaust doesn't even make sense, despite the propaganda, AMERICA DID NOT COMMIT THE HALOCAUST, and Had no reason for it, and are owed 'nothing' to those parts of Europe to stop it, in fact, at first we were allies with the Germans and Nazis (look at Disney's first propaganda films and letters he wrote, saying they were 'right') etc.. shit changed when we got a hold of ""Mein Enkampf"" and Hitler considered White Americans an ""Mongrel, negrified race, of mixing British, with germans, with french, with Polish, with etcc..making them a dog, would you not kill a mongrel dog, so messed up, that they cannot walk, or function?"" etc.. this was in ""Mein Enkampf"" as Hitler checked the bloodlines to the 'great, great', great grandfather' on both sides to makesure they were pure German Aryan, etc...

When the U.S. realized that, then we decided to join in against Hitler with Russia, as we realized, they weren't gonna stop, etc...

But, though I'm glad we intervened, the reason we consider it more than the ""Halocaust"" is because it happened on American soil, and was an attack on our country, so for us, it was one of the worst attacks ever, in our country(Coronavirus may end up being worse), that's the reason for it, quit conflating other countries issues, as if it's America's fault, or responsiblity.

On one breath the OP alluded to that, but on the other breath he/her claims that America did so much, and should 'but out' of other countries issues(implied), is my point.

I was in a fraternity, I have friends in a fraternity in Canada( nothing like ours, think literally, ""anyone can join, just pay a fee' is how it was, with my friend's schools, which lead to many problems in their lives.), they know I was in  a frat, start to bring up the 'paddling, and hazing etc..'

The entire time, they would not stop about how, 'It was gay, or this is gay, paddling is gay, hazing is gay' and I literally listened (This was like 4-5 Canadians talking to me) and I stopped  them after 20-30 mins of this, and I asked, ""This is all from military, bonding, and holding men accountable, and 'tribalism', since when is this gay? Are you guys just watching 'gay porn' or something? Because that's the only media that makes male bonds, brotherhood, fraternity, gay?""

They all got kinda quite, kinda changed the subject, etc...

They gloss over that fact, that they were immoral, racist, loser, scumbags,because it doesnt fit their 'jocks are evil, mediorce kids or couner culture is good' narrative....Then they were  killing random other kids, a fat girls, boys, etc.. that weren't the ones that allegedly 'oppressed them' which was horse shit.

They were just two losers, that didn't do what the town revered, then got jealousy, since no one gave them praise for their brilliance, though they accomplished, and did nothing, like the incels of today, f*ck, just realized they were a 'precusor' before all this bullshit. Etc.."

Mine was more insidious, a fake friend, got a friend of mine I liked a lot (from baseball) to fight me, to 'prove how tough he was', and we fought, I tried not to, the first fight, then the 2nd, we fougth about 6 times in that next 2 weeks, and the 7th time, I was 'looking for him' and we fought again, and he apologized to me... He was bigger than me, I was like 5'9 skinny as heck(prior to my growth spurt) and he was one of those 'fat burly husky kids' that just got 'bigger than us' before we all grew in 7th grade.

Sad part was, we won a championship together the year before, close friends, and this one 'scumbag' fake friend, was the typical ""anything you have they  want, but they pretend they're your friend, and sabotage you type"", and the sad part was, me and the kid that fought, we never recovered as friends. Not at all.

I ended up playing football and track, the kid (fat Tom) ended up playing soccer, and becoming a druggy screw up in high school, the instigator Dan, ended up being the insidious 'druggy scumbag, dealer' turning people out, last I heard, he went to rehab for like the 7-9th time, and left his family broke, etc... 

Crazy how life works out, but I honestly think going through that was better for me, since I'd always 'stick up' for myself, and quick, I wouldn't be bullied, or shit talked at work, etc... I address it, quick, and though it causes some problems, it makes my life a million times better.

To be fair, most African Americans are ashamed of Africa(even the woke ones) and they think that the ""National Geographic"" video they saw of some aborigine tribe with a bone through their nose is 'true Africa' and the entire continent is like that, they don't even realize there are country's, and it's like ten times the size of America... but, ignorance is bliss. I don't blame them, they don't even know that African Nobles and Black Moors ruled and married into royal families in Europe, and were promptly erased.

And I told him,""I've been in over 30-40 fights, I've never seen a gun used, or lethal force, and I was a bouncer at clubs for over 8 years while in college, wtf are you talking about?"" 

He had never been in a fight, could not fight, would not fight, he was the typical fat, loser, on reddit, red pill, no girlfriend weirdo, and I called out his fake 'bravado' and told him how obtuse he was, he just kinda 'laughed' in a cringey way, then tried to change the subject.

Eventually everyone started to 'hate him' for a plethora of reasons, and lies, and he got 'beat up' more than a view times, then was kinda just 'banned from our group' after a while, due to his degenrate ways, his heroin friends etc...

Also, he was kinda crazy, we had a 'fat friend' that was in our group, and he decided to 'take his spot' and did everything to turn us against this kid, since we were friends with this kid before 'he got there' at the college, next level f*ckery, to be honest.


He had so many issues, truly.

I think at his high school, he got a lot of sh*t for being ""Asian"" and though he wasn't really 'Asian or Filipino acting' he just, decided he was 'white' or 'whitish' and would clown or make fun of other filpinos or Asians to his white, though 'white trash' friends, etc.. to 'get in', but what made me look at him wild was he went to 'private school' but had no private school friends, just these random degenerates from his town, and come to find out, he made it seem as if he'd known them since he was like 10, they all met him, his first year of college in that town(he transferred to our community college, like when he was 21 etc..) so, it was a host of lies, etc..

Gets old, bitter, stupid, jealous, lowkey racist, and are fine with people getting 'treated like dirt' until it 'hits them, then it's a problem' types, etc...

I've seen 20 year friendships end, since one kid worked hard and got into a certain college, or got into 'medical school' like the other one, didn't see them working hard, but due to their race, or the 'town decided they weren't smart' they're angry the person made it, though they ate in their house, and have been friend with them for 20 years, etc... it's disgusting, and I don't like it or deal with it.

But as soon as he got 'beat up' he was like a beaten down dog, or some BDSM relationship, since whoever 'put him down' he'd do whatever they asked, and would be their 'bitch' in a sense, and would 'bow down' to them, but the others, he would not, though he made up 'everything' about himself, it was surreal to be honest.


I'll never forget him though, I'd love to talk with you about this, since you're filipino, to know if this is a common thing? I learned so much about filpinos and their culture, living with them, and how most of the men are 'effeminate' etc.. due to wars with China and other places etc...

I think the only reason he was 'with her' was because she was 'white' and would 'take him home' to her family, it was surreal.

They didn't even make sense, and she left him, when I first got to know him.

He was super filipino looking(skin color and all) but was a 'country white boy' in accent, dress, ideals, etc.. met his parents, spoke english and fluent ""Tagalog"" etc.. and were Filipino to the core.

His uncles hated him(the ones that I met), his dad had his back, his mom, was disapointed and loathed him, and blamed his failures on his 'degenerate white friends' but to be fair, they weren't with us at college, and he failed without any of them being there, at all.

Such a crazy thing. He was a spoiled 'first born' Filipino son, given everything, spoiled, looked over, etc... and earned not much, and they were shocked he was a degenerate, etc... it was surreal.

Seeing him, I'd never raise my kids that way, at all, all 'accountability' in my family, and life, due to dealing with him. He would lie to the 'pope' and justify it by the fact he was an 'alter boy' at age 9-12 years old(he would use that as justification for his scumbag deeds etc..) was great at weaving a tale though... Lied to our group for 2-3 years, and when we found out, it was all a charade, was shocked when we all just 'cut him out' like nothing...

Crazy guy, crazy time."
