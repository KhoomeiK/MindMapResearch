To the why question, due to circumstances in my life I wasn't able to finish my masters degree History at university. So some time later I took a turn to Bachelor Applied Informatics but I always had that gnawing feeling I have the potential to get a masters degree.   


In that sense, so I have a ""Kandidatuursdiploma History"" from way back (like 2006). Does it equal a Bachelor History and is that a possible (more realistic) route to a Masters degree ( in History)?"
