They use to tell i am depressed because im single or living alone in a foriegn country where im not fluent with the language and no liberty to go out. A lot of them said i just need to move to a better country. I did, i went to US and the first thing i did went to places i wanted to go. I was happy doing that but at the end of the day when im in my bedroom the emptiness sinks it. So i tried being in a relationship, met a good man and got married. The first few months of marriage was hard drove me more into depression because i was not use being with someone. I just dont have the independence i was used to. Struggled with finances but we were able to came out from it. We now have our own house, a savings and amidst the crippling economy we still have jobs and are healthy. I thank God for being with us but  im am still depressed, i cant handle the medication and i stop taking it. I feel so ungrateful and no matter what the situation is, the demons within me have cemented their bonds and it is unbreakable. Everynight i talk to God, i will suppress them as long as i can but please dont let me live this long. The reality of having this disease is that death is somehow what we always long for. When people ask me if i fear death, my response is, i already made peace with him and awaiting his arrival. I wont force to meet him and live life the way it supposed to be as strongly as i can."
