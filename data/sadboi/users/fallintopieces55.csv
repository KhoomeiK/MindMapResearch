sandiego,fcw2erv,t1_fcvz80a,1578015570.0,"Lol no they don’t dude. I read the entirely of all of those sources and they clearly come to the conclusion that a wage gap exists to some degree. Seeing as how you responded within a few minutes and are that easily swayed by the abstract details, I’m positive you did not do the same. 

First hand experiences are one of the most profound pieces of evidence. I’m confused, you’re saying that numbers tell more about the situation than stories from the actual people who are affected? I’m sorry, but you’re wrong. 

That was the first time I said that, so I’m not sure what you’re talking about. 

Stay in your delusional world, buddy. You’re too far gone ✌🏻"

(An outdated, but valuable source nonetheless) 

Only took a few seconds to find these, not sure where you’ve been looking? I usually find my “propaganda” through my university’s portal, so if I shared that link it would direct you to the student log in page. In this case google scholar will suffice. Unless you have access through a university or pay for the PDF, you can only read the abstract. But to summarize further, it’s evidence of a wage gap between individuals in the same fields and jobs. 

Beyond that, there’s public evidence of famous female athletes being paid less than their male counterparts for decades. I have personally known a person who found out a male coworker in the same position as her made more even though he had been there for was less time. He had the same qualifications as her, and she was a loved employee at the time who was incredible at her job, and was told so on many occasions. There’s no excuse for it. 

It exists. You can deny it until you’re blue in the face, but it doesn’t change anything. 

I’m also not sure what you’re referring to as the jobs that men and women have that are so different? We no longer live in a world where women are at home and men are in the workforce solely. There are female and male neurosurgeons, general laborers, athletes, stay at home parents... the list goes on indefinitely. Any job has its challenges and are hard in their own respect, no matter who’s doing it.  

Only someone who is sexist would even be bothered by any of the topics discussed here to begin with, let alone deny things that are established issues. Just admit to yourself you hate women and love your privilege."

Opinions are one thing, but you’re trying to discredit something that is a fact and has been proven by countless first-hand accounts. What you’re saying sounds right in theory, but you’re missing the very key component of sexism and workplace discrimination. Which happens to women in a way that men (especially white men, which... I definitely could be wrong but I’m pretty sure you might be) will never experience. Please stop blindly tossing aside anything you don’t agree with or haven’t experienced personally, it’s not going to get you very far in life.

depression,f8btedo,t3_e047qc,1574444896.0,"Aw man, I’m sorry to hear you’re going through this currently. I was bullied in elementary and middle school too, and even though I’m 24 now, I’m still dealing with some of the things that were said to me. I know it doesn’t feel like it right now, but life is about so much more than your school and the small opinions of the students who go there. In a couple years, you’ll find yourself in a new school with many different students than the ones you’re surrounded by now, and odds are your situation will get better. Just try to remember everything is temporary and although it doesn’t feel like it, your bullies are hurting too. That’s why people hurt others, because they themselves are hurting and need someone to take it out on. That’s not an excuse for the way they treat you, but maybe it can help put it into perspective for you that they do not know everything, and their opinion of you does not determine who you are. 

if I can give you any advice that might help your current situation it’s this:

One of my biggest regrets is never telling anyone that I was being bullied. I never told my parents or any teachers or school staff. I wish I would’ve done this, and I wish I would’ve kept telling on my bullies every time they did something to me until they stopped. But I was too embarrassed to admit it was happening to me, and too scared that they’d just get worse. So instead, it went on for 5 years without my bullies getting in trouble for any part of it at all. People say “snitches get stitches” but honestly no, in your case, snitches get peace. If there is a teacher or aide or even office staff at your school who you trust, I suggest you tell them and let them know how long it’s been going on and how it makes you feel. If your bullies keep getting in trouble for bullying you, they will eventually leave you alone and find another target. 

also, a funny turn of events have happened that give me a little bit of closure from my bully years. I’m now a college graduate, working on my MA’s degree and many of my bullies dropped out of high school or had kids during high school and are now on drugs. Karma does it’s work well 😊

Hang in there, you’re not alone. It’s hard to be 12, but before you know it you’ll be looking back on these days wondering how on earth they went by so fast. I’m sending you love and support!"
