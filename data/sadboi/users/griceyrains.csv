getdisciplined,fotja2n,t3_g9hbsi,1588055649.0,"I used to have this same problem! (And truth be told I still sort of do, but it has definitely improved and it's something I'm continuing to work on). In high school I developed severe depression which I'm sure was at least in part due to averaging about 4 hours of sleep a night for a solid 2 years. The more depressed I got, though, the more I would turn to those void-filling activities like mindlessly browsing youtube and reddit and keeping myself up later and later. Sort of a vicious cycle.

One of the things I found that really helped me was to just change my perception of what is ""late"". I would maybe go to bed at 11 thinking that was a reasonable time, and then at 2 or 3am, after hours of browsing social media I would look at the clock and think ""oh, that's late, I should really put the phone down now"". I knew that I was going to struggle reducing my browsing time when I was in that depressed state, so instead I just started browsing earlier on. I started doing everything earlier on in the night (having my dinner at 6 instead of 8 for example) and shifting my routine to just start earlier. If I got into bed at 8:30 instead of 11, I could still mindlessly look at my phone for the same amount of time and when I found the willpower to stop it was now 'only' midnight (certainly an improvement).

By shifting my routine (and having one in the first place is a top notch idea), 9pm started to seem late at night for me, so I would just start going to bed earlier. This meant I would wake up earlier, and waking up earlier reinforced the cycle and was generally a good habit for me as it made me feel more productive, like I was starting the day fresh with plenty of time."

Bulimics may also use laxatives or enemas, excerise excessively or use other methods. You can definitely be diagnosed with bulimia if you binge and then fast.

I think it's a shame that men with this disorder are not given anywhere near as much attention as the women who also have it, and even as a woman myself it was refreshing to read  this and hear a new perspective of someone experiencing this disorder in a different way to me. I'm sorry that you're going through this man and I hope it gets better for you. I know that you don't feel it but you have to trust the evidence that is present and know that you really are far bigger than you know. I'm sure it has taken a lot of work for you to build up this strength and have a body like that so kudos to you, I just wish that you could see your progress and feel good about it. It think it's also worth noting how much it sucks that because of your body you get stereotyped as just some asshole jock, which clearly isn't true (at least not the asshole part). Anyway, best of luck to you and I hope that one day you can see yourself through someone else's eyes"

amiugly,f3whsly,t3_dii8dc,1571203039.0,"Not ugly. I see a lot of people pointing out how great your skin is and that's definitely an awesome thing you have going for you. If you want tips, I would say ditch the choker (not flattering on anybody but especially if you're larger since it makes the neck look much shorter and wider). Your hair is nice but parted too far to the side, I would say go for a softer side parting. Great job on working to lose weight! You look beautiful how you are but weight makes a huge difference to everyone and would definitely make you much more of a knockout. I think you could really rock bangs, it would shorten your face which is slightly long and bring more attention to your eyes, although there is a risk (especially with straight cut bangs) that they could make your face appear a bit too chubby. Once you've lost a bit of weight I would definitely recommend trying the bangs if you like the idea. A person down below also commented a really great tip for makeup to help open up your hooded eyes :)

Edit: Glasses!! Glasses frames definitely aren't working. I would recommend getting thinner frames and go for a more circular shape"

Talking about it at group therapy would be awesome and you should do that if you can!

Your hair looks naturally good but the cut isn't working, try going shorter on the sides and keeping top full, shorter overall (LOVE those curls though) or alternatively consider going long. In the future I think you could rock a beard but right now you should go clean shaven. Fix your eyebrows up so they're a bit neater, that's something that's dragging you down a surprising amount. Other than that I would say just work on losing weight, it will give your face a nicer shape and an overall better, more healthy appearance.
