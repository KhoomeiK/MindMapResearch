I could never look like that without photoshop because I’m not naturally that beautiful” but the reality is plastic surgery, fillers, and top of the line skin care.

WEEDS,foa5v3d,t3_g66jf4,1587640353.0,"Favorite scene: the scene where Andy teaches Shane about jerking off, it’s always been one of the more memorable scenes of this season imo, and of course Andy is hilarious. 


Favorite piece of dialogue: 


“what’s in a bean pie anyway” 


“ground up white babies and nutmeg” 



Favorite character: Andy. Despite his flaws, he seems to be the best thing for the boys at this point in the show- he really steps up when Nancy is increasingly distant.


Thoughts:

I really like Nancy’s fear and loathing shirt and its sort of a cute reference to the whole Las Vegas thing. Where can I get one? Lol

Silas is such a stupid asshole in this episode for the condom thing

For me, this is the episode where is starts to seem like Nancy is putting herself/her business/whatever over her family. She seems to act like a teenager sometimes, and when I first watched this show, I would’ve blamed it on grief or whatever. But after seeing it multiple times you just start to realize that Nancy is a shitty mom, friend, partner, etc and she only looks out for herself."

It doesn’t say they are rich. It says they have more material goods. A lot of the poor people I know are hoarders and they do have a lot of material gods but that doesn’t make them “rich”.


I can tell from experience that being poor in America does not give you good opportunities. Yes we get Medicaid, can’t find a doctor in my county who accepts it so I have to drive over an hour. Can find a dentist who accepts it in the whole state. Yeah we can get food stamps, 500 a month max. Is that enough to feed a family of 6 for a month? Hell no. Yes we get charity- expired food donations and more milk than my lactose intolerant self could ever know what to do with. But hey, who am I to complain? I’m fucking rich."

He made it seem like it would be better for both of them if they got married because Nancy was worried about getting arrested. Really he was just trying to trick her into dating him, abusing his position of power over her."
WEEDS,fo2jw9y,t3_g4zpul,1587465216.0,"Favorite scene: definitely gonna have to go with the mohasky cup scene. 


Favorite piece of dialog: “I don’t know, we just call each other ‘maid friend’”- Lupita, when Celia asks if one of her maid friends hit her car. 


Favorite character: My favorite character in this episode is Megan, because she chooses college over a teenage relationship and I think that’s a good example of a strong female. 


I like this episode a lot because it brings us back to the root of what this show is about - weed. I love the simplicity of the first season and I find myself wishing they could stay in Agrestic and Nancy would remain small, doing what’s best for her family. I guess it wouldn’t have been as interesting of a show. 


This episode introduces us to U-Turn, and that scene may be some foreshadowing of what’s to come. I really hated u-turn, but I hated him less than the some of the show’s other antagonists.


Also I really fucking hate Peter, what is he trying to do, blackmail her Into dating him?"

misophonia,flthwb4,t1_flsytgf,1585473593.0,"Not exactly your question, but my ex was like that. There was this snore spray we used and it was the one thing that worked. Before that we slept in different rooms. I believe it was made by “breathe right”... maybe it’s worth a try if she’s open to it."
misophonia,flthrgx,t1_flsfkio,1585473429.0,I recently bought some ear plugs and they don’t take the noise away completely but they help a lot. I want to get noise cancelling headphones
pics,fltghm5,t1_flsvpkc,1585471841.0,"I once had pneumonia but I had virtually no symptoms. They called it walking pneumonia. I had a really bad cold, went to the doctor, and they sent me home with a diagnoses of “chest inflammation” because i said I had chest pain. 6 months later, my sister came home and found me lying on the floor passed out with blue lips. She took me to the hospital and they admitted me right away and I had to have emergency surgery to cut open my lungs to remove the fluid. I was in the hospital for 2 months recovering. I couldn’t even walk for the first couple weeks. 

Pneumonia is no joke."
WEEDS,fltg6ie,t3_fr0mmm,1585471467.0,"I watched it back when it first came out and I really liked it then. I was a teenager and I thought it was cool. As someone who’s mom was very similar to Nancy but not quite as bad, I always had a hard time with some of the scenes of her being a shitty mom- like when Shane starts talking to his ghost dad because Nancy keeps ignoring him. 


At first, it seems like she’s doing it for the kids. But after time, her motivation becomes less clear and she starts to seem more selfish. The way she treats Andy is horrible, too- like when she leaves him in the desert."
