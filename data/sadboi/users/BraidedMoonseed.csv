Whatever it is I’m really happy with it so I really have no where to complain. I’m just curious and want to understand, and of course I’m a little jealous, but this really makes me feel better. He is a very clean cut kinda guy and cares about his appearances for work so I understand and this is mental and physical cleaning or something. Thanks"

sex,fpqmq82,t1_fpqhn2z,1588826498.0,"This makes so much sense! I personally hate junk food and don’t eat it but doesn’t mean he’s that way. I can accept that he likes it and eats it sometimes.

BipolarReddit,fmv14dn,t1_fmqkrp4,1586403508.0,Ya I understand. I don’t know why I told them tbh I just did. Technically they can’t fire you bc of a disability but doesn’t mean it doesn’t happen so that sucks. When I had to take time off I guess I felt I had to explain why I couldn’t work for an unknown amount of time bc I was so physically depressed I couldn’t even lift my arms. I kinda wish I didn’t tell them bc I feel them judging me but oh well they’ll just have to get to know me.
BipolarReddit,fmqj59p,t1_fmprr9u,1586300626.0,Hahahahahahah. Ya that’s hilarious how you put that. My big bosses know I’m bipolar bc I had to miss work bc of it but my immediate boss doesn’t cuz she’s new and I don’t want her to know. Well thanks for responding. We get each other 👊
