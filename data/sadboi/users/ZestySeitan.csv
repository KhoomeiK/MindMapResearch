mentalillness,foohu09,t3_g8e5ze,1587939238.0,"It must be so difficult to feel like you can't access to the kind of treatment you need, I used to feel hopeless about finding a therapist after meeting with several and not gelling with any of them.  It wasn't until I moved to a city that I found really good psychology professionals, so there is definitely not enough access in more remote areas.  

There are options though!  There are online therapists you can access that are very affordable and could help you get in contact with the right psychiatrist.  Especially now, there may even be therapists and psychologists who are conducting sessions remotely that you normally wouldn't have access too because they are in a different city or state.

The best place that I have found to look for therapists is by searching Psychology Today's database, there you can see the therapists and their specialties as well as short personal statements/bios so you can find one who you think you'll be able to connect with.  Otherwise, trying an online therapy space could be really worth it! Having a strong relationship with a therapist is where real healing starts to happen because they know you and your history so well and can also show you what a healthy relationship feels like.

And remember, there is nothing wrong with you--you are reacting to emotional and environmental triggers which are all things that can be worked on with the right therapist and medication.  You're not ""crazy"", your experiences are valid and so is your reaction to them.  This is a really hard time for you and you are capable of working through it to feel good again!"
mentalillness,fokunki,t3_g7pfce,1587849279.0,"I totally see this too.  I think because so many people with mental health issues have experienced their fair share of gaslighting, it creates a defensiveness around their diagnosis.  There is a lot of fear around being invalidated or playing into ""mainstream"" perspectives on mental illness that may result in further invalidation, which may get projected around in some communities."

mentalillness,foeg9oh,t3_g70gr7,1587703031.0,"Try to pick out things that are real in your environment, so things you can perceive with your senses only.  What's happening in your mind is chatter and a narrative and that's it.  You can't help it from coming up but there are things you can do to bring yourself back.  Sometimes for me its a pillow, ill pick it up and try to notice as many details about it.  Texture, softness or hardness, color, shape.  I try to force myself to be as curious as possible about my physical environment and it usually brings me back.  I try to do it until my mind no longer wants to go back to chattering. 

If the chatter is persistent, I try to do the same thing but with whats going on in my head.  So trying to notice almost objectively all of the topics, storylines, words, people that are passing through and I try to notice qualities about the thoughts almost like an outside observer.  It keeps me from feeding into them. 

Hope this helps!"
mentalillness,foefc8d,t3_g70q9j,1587702388.0,"Don't be too hard on yourself.  When you are experiencing trauma, your sort of leave your body as a defense mechanism--this is not conducive to memory creation and not your fault! It is your mind's way of trying to protect you.  It's sad to look back on your childhood and feel like it is far away and I think it's something a lot of people experience once they transition into adulthood, it kind of sneaks up on you. 

You've been through a lot, be gentle and patient with yourself, and with time, therapy, and developing new healthy ways of being, you will begin to return to yourself.  It really does take time and patience--easier said than done. 

I know how you feel and went through something similar in my early 20s, you're not losing it.  You're processing possibly a decade of trauma and that is no easy task, but you can do it.  You can rebuild and get to know yourself again."
mentalillness,foee2lj,t3_g6nfpb,1587701543.0,"oh god, this is me, podcasts in the shower, if I get up to do dishes, if I take a study break to eat, and then its music constantly if I actually need to use my brain, and tv shows if I'm within a three-foot radius of my bed.  I feel untethered if I don't have noise to fill the space, I have a noise machine that has been on since I got it 8 months ago.  

I know how this sounds, but in the rare moments when I can actually break out of the trance, I do a 5 min meditation with an app.  The first minute or two is unbearable, but by the end, I feel sort of reset and relieved."
mentalillness,foedcyy,t1_focurnw,1587701091.0,"Good, don't start! It is definitely a false sense of security like I am getting ""to the bottom"" of what's ""wrong with me"".  But at the end of the day, it never yields answers and just makes me feel crap.  I love that you mention that ""me""-ness inside, I have it too but sometimes forget :)"

tretinoin,fmlbxnb,t1_fmksb1x,1586183288.0,"No problem :) Not usually! But you could if you feel you need more moisture.  Also, if your eye area is super sensitive, you could try applying moisturizer or even Vaseline as another commenter suggested before applying any tretinoin/moisturizer and then avoid those areas."
tretinoin,fmkn6cs,t3_fvsix3,1586160924.0,"This has happened to me on several occasions, it felt like an irritated, burning sensation around the eye.  What helped was mixing it in with nightly moisturizer as a buffer--typically a quarter-sized blob of moisturizer with a pea of tret mixed on the back of my hand.  This way, you're not putting the product directly on any part of your face where it could get carried to the eye area.  I find it's a lot less harsh this way!"
rutgers,fkbkrem,t3_fgo5m0,1584034811.0,"Like the other comment, it depends what exactly they’re trying to shame you for missing out on?  Idk peaking in college is extremely overrated and there is so much more you’ll be able to experience after graduation.  If drinking/partying excessively is the only way to “make the most of your college experience” then maybe there is something wrong with that definition of a college experience?  College is a time for experimentation, whatever that means for you!!  Whether is be travel, hobbies, relationships, sexuality, etc and yes for some it’s experimenting with substances but in what capacity you experiment is entirely up to you!"
rutgers,fj30lni,t3_faosa9,1582961452.0,"Try talking to your professor first, let them know your situation (briefly)/intentions of going to DOS and/or ODS.  They may be more accomodating if you give them a heads up.  Policy wise I dont think you can do anything retroactively.  But, in the DOS can send a letter and then its up to profs discretion.  You'll probably need a note from Dr. or therapist for them to send a letter.  Then, once you get approval for accomodations from ODS, if you decide to go that route, the prof legally has to comply but that doesnt apply retroactively.  Mostly, its good to do this in case it comes up again in the future, that way youre more prepared and youll have a bit more space to work something out."
toastme,fit5848,t3_f9l2jz,1582704995.0,"You’re still so young!!  It’s completely normal to not have met someone yet—there is absolutely nothing wrong with you.  Focus on you and finding all the things about you tou love and the right person will see them too.  It takes time and there’s nothing wrong with being single.  I know this is dumb and a cliche but as soon as you stop looking and find contentment by yourself, that’s when someone comes along.  Confidence and self love is more magnetic than any physical attribute!"
