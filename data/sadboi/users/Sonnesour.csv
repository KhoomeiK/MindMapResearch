I definitely recommend getting a keyboard if you haven't got one yet (check r/piano for their FAQs on purchasing a nice starter keyboard, but even if those are over your price range, anything will work and you can upgrade later on). I started teaching myself from method books (like the Alfred series) before I got a teacher years later. I don't meet with her anymore, but it might be a good option for you until things open up again from COVID. There are also youtube tutorials nowadays, too, but for composing, you'll probably also want to know your notes (you might already, just saying, haha!).

I am going to try taking some advice I gave to someone else and to pick one small thing to focus on in a positive light. It's better than zero things, and hopefully it will lead to more. Thank you for the offer - I think I'm going to rewrite the section, though, that I had submitted to the critique group - it got poor reception, lol.. from more than one person (it was my first submission with them and since it was a group I guess I just wasn't prepared to hear such negativity from SO many people). I am wanting to improve, though, and one guy did send a follow-up message apologizing for his tone (they normally meet in person but I'm the weirdo that joined once COVID-19 happened and meeting in person wasn't an option, so I am sort of like a weird intruder in their group.

depression,fohuzqp,t1_foeo4gz,1587773158.0,"I agree with this. The thing is, you are right. Being sober doesn't automatically make things better or feel better. You still have to deal with the problems head-on (and with a clear mind, too, so you are able to get hit with all of the sadness/anger/shit that goes with whatever the problem is). It sucks, but ultimately, it's the better way to deal with things. Drowning in alcohol will only mask the problem, yet when the problem persists long-term (because you aren't dealing with it, whereas you are more likely to deal with it sober) then that causes even MORE problems, and it just spirals out of control. Some people see it, a lot of people don't and think everything is just fine or that they don't want to change. Don't go back to the alcohol due to depression. Please, don't."

depression,foht0bf,t3_g6x0gm,1587772068.0,"You have been through a lot. I'm very sorry to hear about everything. You've had a really bad year. Try to keep up with the sobriety. I can only imagine how hard it is. 

I rarely drink, but my entire family were alcoholics, and my aunt, whom I was close to, passed away in February from it and my uncle has been working on his sobriety since then (well, technically a little before then, but pretty close to the time of her passing). I'm so proud to say that he has maintained his sobriety thus far, and I can't imagine the pain he's had to go through to resist it (I know he REALLY wanted to drink when we got back from the funeral). He's had so many attempts at getting sober, so I just want to say that if you end up breaking it, start again. Obviously the goal is NOT to break it, but yeah... With everything you've gone through, it is going to be easy for you to want to go to alcohol. It sucks so much, but I really do think that the best, and truest way to face your problems head-on, is sober. And it's going to suck. <-- this is coming from someone that hasn't gone through it, so I'd totally understand if you want to disregard my comment, but this is a comment from the sober side, having lived in households surrounded by alcohol and seeing what it can do to a family. 

A lot of people can understand on some level and there's empathy. Reaching out is a good thing to do, and I don't know if you'd be interested in doing that right now, but I'm sure there are some AA meetings being held online (I only know this because my uncle hosts his local AA meeting and he's doing them via Zoom). Resources are still available, it just is made MUCH harder to find and squeeze into. You have to want to check it out, too. No judgement if you aren't ready yet, but it's important to keep it in mind.

So, yeah. For the non-personal stuff: One thing they teach in Al-Anon (a support group for those that have lived with alcoholics) is that you can't control another person or their actions. I've been trying my best to apply this to the greater aspects of the world during the coronavirus pandemic. I struggle, I sometimes fall off the boat and go into worry mode, but the fact is, I can't change what Trump says or how he acts, so why should I worry so much about it? You can't change other people or the actions they take, you can only focus on your own, so I do my best not to let the political stuff bother me when I find myself at this low point (currently there, but without any good reason). It'll just drain you, mentally, and you just don't have a lot of mental strength to give toward that when you're in a low state.

The personal stuff, though, yeah, that's rough. Just having someone that you loved with someone else is rough, and you've got a lot more than just that.

Try to focus on you. Try to find one small thing that you want to do tomorrow that will benefit you in some way.

Stay strong. Keep it up."

It's definitely difficult if you don't have a lot (or any) people to rely on. And even if you do have someone, you can't even voice this truth to them out of fear that they will either leave you (hell, friendships fall apart for much more minor things, so chances are something big like this is just going to push them away more) or they will think you're a suicide risk, and thus how they'd act thinking that is NOT how you would want them to act, so you just keep it bottled up inside.

Things can get better, but I'm right there with you. I don't feel I have a reason to be depressed, yet I hate myself so much and can't exceed at anything (or reach the bare minimum in shit I care about) that it just doesn't feel like it's a ""legitimate"" reason to be depressed. It just... is. I don't know if you feel this way, but it seems like it due to you mentioning having a reason. I feel the same way, and it makes me feel like a crybaby and makes me super defensive ALL THE TIME (and irrationally angry - my anger levels are through the roof).

fantasywriters,fllewww,t3_fpgvgl,1585259025.0,"It didn't read like the beginning of a short story to me, honestly. I thought the writing was overall pretty good, yet convoluted. I often found myself having to correct for images I had already formed in my mind. For example, your opening could be deemed an intriguing opening, yet it led me to believe that there was a lion in the ballet. There's nothing inherently wrong with this - intrigue is brought by a good hook, but when I'm constantly having to revise my image of what is actually going on versus what is stated in the first sentence of several paragraphs, it slows me down. Thus, it feels like a ""long story"".

By the end of the third paragraph, I'm still not able to visualize what is going on. I feel this could be... acceptable... in a novel, but I wonder if that could be a problem in a short story (I bring this up because I don't often read short stories). For example, you mention all these animals and mythological creatures that come in reverence to the ballet, leading me to believe that Clover is perhaps not a human. Yet she is wearing a lion's costume. So, what is she? Who is she? There's unnecessary deception here unless this is meant to be part of a twist (I cannot tell from just the opening).

Honestly, this intrigued me: ""Apprentice-quality taxidermy cluttered the walls."" Since I'm imagining (because I'm not given good grounding as to what to visualize) that these characters are animal-creatures of some sort, I'm just intrigued by this. What makes the elk different from the unicorns and vultures that warrants them being stuffed as decorations upon the Ballet, and yet the unicorns and vultures and spiders are just free to attend? This intrigued me more than the ending did (which alluded to a typical heist-style plot).

""Fine boots ambled above her head"" is awkward phrasing. You can perhaps fix this by keeping like sentences together. i.e. Instead of inserting random character descriptions (skin color, nimbleness) between the sentence of Clover being underneath the floor and the patrons walking above, try to keep them together. Alternatively, phrase it in a punchier way to make me feel like I am there. There's description, sure, but it's not leading me to any one thing, if that makes sense.

I believe you can write well, but it's being wasted on superfluous detail and unnecessary actions. Despite the visuals, I was not seeing anything. Now, I will say this: I enjoyed all of the words you employed, and I think that is something I could improve upon in my own writing (I prefer and write simpler prose, so understand that this critique is coming from that bias).

Your ending (of this scene) could be good, but contradicts all the time you spent describing the ballet. ""She'd lingered too long"", imo, is not a good way to justify spending so much time on the beginning. It read as lazy writing to me (which I found odd, because I can quite easily tell that you are not a lazy writer and write well) - it was just an excuse to give the reader for all that description instead of truly being in the character's head. If you feel I am wrong on this (and that would be fair), I would still say this is good critique: If I am wrong, and your character truly does think that, then that means I do not know your character up until that point, and could be something you look into.

Overall/Other: I love, love, LOVE your use of vocabulary, but would like a greater focus on character. Your description in most places is good, but I'd like to see you push it a bit more in a meaningful way instead of it being JUST description. You're connecting it to your world, but the translation is lost on the meaning I should get from that while reading. Your natural pacing style seems to lean more toward the ""longer, slower pacing"" of a novel than that of a short story, but this is coming from someone who doesn't read short stories, so pinch o' pepper and all that. I have no opinion on character as of this point in the story, and I think that is okay."
