seems like lot of people are either in, or headed towards poverty, i have a job for now, and im trying to be grateful but just feel utterly burned out to the max.

i know how it feels to feel like a failure. i feel like that every day. i honestly dont know why im still here but i am. i guess all we can really do is get through each day, one at a time. i hate thinking of the future, it makes me depressed and anxious. 

i hope things turn around for you!"

SuicideWatch,flpfhul,t3_fq9xpw,1585358266.0,numbness is a characteristic of depression. i go through phases of feeling that way. i think its when it all becomes too much and you can no longer handle it so you just stop feeling anything at all.
