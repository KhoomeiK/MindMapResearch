Anxiety in itself is t just about mental health. There is a physical connection as well. The vagus nerve controls the autonomic system - fight or flight. This uneasiness is triggered by the feeling of danger and there is a lot of danger in the world right now that we have no control over. Other things that affect that nerve are things we put into or do to our bodies, cigarettes, caffiene lack of exercise and sleep sitting in front of a screen forever poor diet choices, or it could be triggered by a lack of essential vitamins and minerals. This is why Gatorade works, calcium, potassium, water, vit D, quinine and pickle juice are helpful too."
