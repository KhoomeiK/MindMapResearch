Yes you do. I mean, yes I do. As a 32 yo woman with a tubal ligation, I can 100% guarantee that I still have periods.

Maybe you meant a full hysterectomy? Your period stops after your ovaries are removed."
AskDocs,erqviix,t1_elv2dcy,1561153118.0,"I had an endometrial ablation and it did help reduce heavy and irregular bleeding. During the procedure, they were able to diagnose me with endometriosis. (I had all the scans and tests; external scans *rarely* show endo, fyi.)

My first reaction, like yours, was to want a hysterectomy. For my symptoms to change from a hysterectomy, it would have to be a full (both ovaries and uterus) hysterectomy, which would **start menopause immediately** because those hormones are produced by my ovaries. I'm 32. Starting menopause this early can affect your bone density for the rest of your life, in addition to just being unpleasant. Also, some women with endo have reported no pain relief from a hysterectomy, so that doesn't sound as promising to me.

I'm now hoping for excision surgery, which would just remove the scar tissue that is binding my internal organs together. I completely understand the *cut it out of me* instinct, but keep seeking opinions and try to find the source of your problem before having everything removed. (My mother, for example, has had a tipped bladder ever since her hysterectomy, meaning tripping up can cause her to lose bladder control. Also, prolapse is more common after a hysterectomy.) Make sure you know all the potential side-effects, just so you're prepared."
