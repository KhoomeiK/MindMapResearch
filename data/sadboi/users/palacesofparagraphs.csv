Advice,fqsd1d2,t3_gknv66,1589604051.0,"It sounds like you're dealing with some depression, likely caused or increased by quarantine. I'm in the same boat right now, and it sucks.

The thing to do is to start small and build up. For me, having some sort of schedule has helped. My sister is living with us and working from home, so I know that we're all on our own while she's at work, but we go downstairs to cook dinner and hang out together around 6 when she gets off. If you can plan to eat with your mom, and maybe hang out with her after dinner, it will give some structure to your day.

It's also a good idea to set a sleep schedule. It doesn't really matter what it is as long as it feels good. Try waking up and going to bed one hour earlier than you have been, then push it 15 minutes earlier per day until you're at a time that feels healthier to you. My natural sleep schedule is about 2am-10am, which is pretty late, but I know when I start staying up past 3:30 I'm not doing so well and it's time to push it back.

You also need to introduce some activity into your day. Again, start small. Set a goal to go outside every other day even if it's literally walking to the end of the block and back. Give yourself some sort of project to do, like organizing a messy closet or even just finishing a coloring book. The next time you're feeling bored or sedentary, work on the project for at least 15 minutes. Often once you get started, you'll want to keep working, and you'll feel good about having accomplished something. Even if you stop after 15 minutes, then hey, you did something for 15 minutes! And that's better than nothing.

Last but not least, if you have access to remote therapy, it's not a bad idea to try it out. I've seen therapists on and off for depression for several years, and just having someone to process things with has made a huge difference in how I'm coping right now.

Hang in there. Start small. You will feel better. We will get through this."
Advice,fqhxsha,t1_fqhs7xy,1589386450.0,"> That’s not necessarily true. Sometimes people’s feelings just fade over time and they don’t really realise it until they are confronted with the possibility of breaking up.

That's definitely true, but there's still always some sense of loss, even if it's just the loss of what you never had but hoped for. You also still need some way to reset into a new relationship. I suppose if both people's feelings faded completely and simultaneously to the point where they already *were* ""just friends"" without realizing it, then many they could just continue, but that's a pretty rare situation. Usually the relationship ends with some residual feelings somewhere, and those feelings need to be dealt with before friendship will be possible.

>People grieve differently. There are people who will find it helpful to know what their former partner is up to and know they are well and moving on in order for them to be able to let go themselves and move on.

That's also true. But it's a hard line to walk between being held back by worry for your ex and being held back by not letting them go. I generally find the best way to manage this is to go through a third party, if you can. When my ex and I broke up, we were able to check in on each other through mutual friends. You can't badger them, obviously, or expect them to be go-betweens, but if you know your friend has seen your ex, you can get the reassurance of, ""Yeah, I've seen him, he's doing okay"" without getting too close yourself.

>Also you forget that there are people who don’t have the choice to cut contact. If kids are involved it won’t be possible to keep your distance. People have and people can deal with this situation as well.

Obviously sometimes cutting contact isn't possible. There are always complications in our lives that mean we can't do 100% of what works in a vacuum, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't get as close as we can. If you still have to see your ex because of kids or work or whatever, that's fine, but you should limit it to what's necessary at first. You deal with what you have to deal with, but your healing process will be easier if you don't deal with *more* than you have to deal with."

Just because you said, ""Okay, we're broken up,"" doesn't mean you immediately start seeing each other differently or interacting differently. You need space apart not only to grieve the relationship (in whatever capacity you need to; even if you wanted it to end there's grief involved) but also to figure out who you are without the other person.

socialjustice101,fqdwbm7,t3_gibt8g,1589297721.0,"So first, there's a difference between sex and gender. Sex is the biological part of your identity. It's the part that influences what genitals, chromosomes, hormones, secondary sex characteristics, etc. you have. Gender is the social part of your identity. It's the part that influences what clothes you wear, your haircut, what pronouns you use, what words you use to describe yourself, etc. Gender is related to and influenced by sex, but the two are distinct. That is to say, female people are usually women and male people are usually men, but that's not always the case. There are also people who identify as neither men nor women, or as some combination of both, regardless of their sex.

Because gender is the social part of our identity, it's the part that matters to other people. When you meet someone new, it's their gender identity that you should be concerned with, not their sex, because the information you're looking for is how to refer to and think about them, right? You want to know what pronouns to refer to them with, and if you should say ""that guy over there"" or if 'guy' isn't the right word.

The biological part of someone's identity, their sex, is really only relevant to themself, their sexual partner(s), and their doctor. Those are the only people who need to know anything about their genitals or hormones, right? All the rest of us need to know is how to interact with this person.

Once you understand how sex and gender are distinct, it's easier to get your head around how someone might be trans, or how someone might even have a nonbinary gender (not strictly a man or a woman). It's also worth noting that even sex is less binary than we often assume. There are many ways in which someone can be [intersex](https://isna.org/faq/what_is_intersex/), which means they have physical characteristics that do not fall neatly into the 'male' or 'female' categories. For example, someone who has some XX cells and  some XY cells would be considered intersex. Like male and female people, intersex people may identify as men, as women, or as nonbinary."

The best course of action is to use terms that are generally considered unoffensive, but if a specific person asks you not to use a specific term around them or when referring to them, you should respect that.

'People of color' (abbreviated 'PoC' or 'POC') is useful because it's inclusive, but sometimes people don't like it because of its proximity to 'colored people' (which you should not use).

'Black and brown folks' (or 'black and brown people') is useful because it's very neutral, but is potentially less inclusive because while 'black' is pretty well-defined, 'brown' is not, and many people who are Asian, indigenous, or even latinx may not identify as 'brown.'

'Nonwhite folks' (or 'people,' same as above) is a useful term when talking specifically about dynamics surrounding white privilege, and how someone's experience is impacted not just because they *are* black or brown or whatever, but because they are *not* white.

changemyview,fq8rcb5,t1_fq50j55,1589173364.0,"Just like with food, it's a question of both time and access. If you work 40 or even 50 hours a week with two days off, you've got enough flexibility with your free time to exercise a few times a week, particularly if you've got adequate childcare. If you're working multiple jobs (especially with irregular schedules, which is common for low-wage jobs) and don't have someone else to watch your kids when they're not in school, you've got a lot less flexible time.

And then we have access issues. Low-income folks can't afford a gym membership, and they're much more likely to live in urban areas where there isn't a good place to run. It's less that their communities are unsafe than that the *environment* is; it's pretty hard to run on crowded sidewalks or up and down busy streets. They may get some exercise from walking or from physical work at their job, but generally not enough to actively lose weight.

This isn't to say there's no hope. There are certainly poor people who work their asses off to stay fit and healthy on top of making ends meet. But the point is that it's a lot harder to maintain a healthy weight--or your health in general--if you're poor in a high-income country, which is why obesity is often an indicator of oppression rather than privilege."

So, for example, social justice activists seek to dismantle the patriarchy, which is a societal system in which men and masculinity are valued over women and femininity. Patriarchy is what makes us pay men more than women for the same job, or think it's degrading for a man to be feminine, or shame women for their sexual behavior. This inequality is perpetuated by individual behaviors and biases, like a man assuming a female coworker is a secretary. It's also perpetuated by societal systems, like law enforcement using a woman's sexual history to discredit her rape allegation.

Similar dynamics exist regarding race, gender identity, sexual orientation, mental health, disability, etc. Social justice activists seek to create a just society in which all groups are treated and valued equally."
changemyview,fq4ziqw,t3_gguy0z,1589088082.0,"Have you seen examples of fat people claiming they are triggered simply by seeing skinny people? I don't want to invalidate your experiences, but I've never come across this. I've heard people say they're triggered by talk about weight (losing it, gaining it, etc.), and that weight-talk can be more triggering when it comes from skinny people, but I've never heard anyone say they're triggered just by the *presence* of skinny people.

But also, I'd like to challenge your idea that fat people are privileged to be able to eat themselves fat. In fact, fat people in developed countries are much more likely to be poor than wealthy. The reason for this is that poor people have access to lower-quality food than wealthy people do. Things like meat and fresh produce are generally more expensive than fast food, carbs, etc. [Food deserts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert) only exacerbate this problem. Also, wealthy people are more likely to have more free time to meal plan, cook, and put effort into varying their diets. Someone who's working multiple jobs and doesn't have help with childcare is much more likely to resort to fast food or pre-made frozen meals to save time.

It sounds like you were extremely food-insecure as a child, and that's incredibly difficult to go through. People all over the world deal with food insecurity and starvation.

The difference is that while people can't tell from looking that I don't exercise or that you're diabetic, fat people have to wear their fatness visibly at all times, and we judge them for it. A fat person who eats well and exercises regularly is probably more healthy than a thin person who spends all day on the computer and eats junk food, but that's not the assumption strangers make when looking at them.

We should promote healthy behavior, but our idea of healthy behavior shouldn't incorporate weight. While it's true that healthy behavior will keep your weight moderate and unhealthy behavior may increase or decrease it, ultimately it's not the weight itself that's the problem, it's the effects of the weight on your organs and joints. And there are ways to address those effects that may or may not involve losing weight, and even if they do may not involve losing weight to the point of being thin.

>1) distinguished by some unusual quality, especially : being in some way superior

Fraternal twins are much less common than single births, and are therefore unusual. Fraternal twins are neither superior nor inferior to identical twins or anybody else, so that part's not relevant.

>2) held in particular esteem

People don't necessarily like people more or less based on their twin status, but they do generally find twinhood interesting.

But also, the experience of being a twin, whether identical or fraternal, is different from the experience of just having a sibling, just like the experience of having an older brother is different from that of having a younger one. A lot of sibling relationships are based on age; who's bigger, who gets to do what first, who gets to make various decisions, how long it is before the second sibling does something the first did, where each person is in their life and development. Having a twin is inherently different from having a sibling of a different age, because it means you're both at the same stage in life at the same time."
changemyview,fpuj8u2,t1_fpt8vc0,1588914339.0,"The entire point of marriage is to build a life together, supporting one another. This means there's a division of labor and a sharing of responsibilities. There are an infinite number of ways to divide that labor, but regardless of the details, the understanding is that both people contribute to everything it takes to sustain the life of the couple.

A lot of these contributions are financial, but a lot are not. Housework, running errands, contacting the landlord, repairs, doing laundry, paying bills, cooking meals, planning vacations, mowing the lawn, all these are part of what it takes to sustain the couple. Why do only the paychecks count? Why are all these other tasks worth nothing when we evaluate and divide the life these two people have built together?

Furthermore, it's not even as simple as ""these activities generate money and these do not,"" because the couple is working as a team. The husband is able to be more successful at his job *because* of his wife's non-financial contributions. He is less stressed and better rested because he doesn't have to worry about cooking or cleaning or grocery shopping, and this will improve the quality of his work. He can afford to go on business trips or stay late at the office or pick up extra shifts because his wife is home to deal with the kids and anything else that needs attending. He's not distracted at work by thoughts of chore lists, parent-teacher conferences, or how we have to call the plumber about the leaky sink. And not to mention the amount this couple is saving on childcare!

When two people get married, the life they build together belongs to both of them. Your proposal means that the working partner's money really only belongs to them, and their spouse only gets to use it. Nobody should have to keep financial score against their partner against the day when the marriage dissolves. What a sad way to live. People should be able to trust, rely on, and work with their partners. A marriage where only the money counts, where each dollar only belongs to the person who earned it, is not a partnership between adults making a life together, it's just two people who live in the same house."

Yes, Snape protects Harry and spies on Voldemort at great personal risk. He also straight-up bullies the children in his care. I feel like the movies gloss over this a lot; Movie Snape is basically just a strict, grumpy teacher who dislikes Harry. Book Snape is vindictive, and uses his authority to belittle, insult, and unjustly punish kids he doesn't like. Can you imagine being a full-grown adult and trying to force a 13-year-old to poison his own pet, then punishing him when the pet doesn't die? Seeing a 15-year-old suffering a medical emergency where her teeth grow uncontrollably, and instead of sending to the nurse using it as an opportunity to insult her appearance? Threatening to illegally drug a 14-year-old to force him to give you information? Regularly telling your students they are stupid and incompetent when they make mistakes or ask questions? 

Not to mention that he tries hard (and eventually succeeds) to get Lupin, a member of an oppressed minority who struggles to find employment, fired because he doesn't like him, or when he tries to get Sirius' soul sucked out despite four different people trying desperately to explain that Sirius is innocent.

>They whine about Snape not caring about James (""if you love someone you care about their loved ones"") while ignoring James didn't care about Snape being Lily's friend either. He kept on bullying him, completely disregarding Lily's wishes.

First of all, James and Lily weren't together until 7th year. Lily stopped being friends with Snape at the end of 5th year, after he called her a slur. But even more importantly, there's a pretty big difference between picking on a school rival, even if you take it too far, and being okay with an innocent man and child being murdered.

>I care about the double standards. The Marauders and Draco seem to receive a free pass in the fandom Snape doesn't receive and that’s what bothers me.

We know James was a bully at school, and that he could be unnecessarily unkind when fighting with Snape. We also know that many people we trust (Lupin, Sirius, Hagrid) liked him as an adult and claim he grew out of his bad behavior. And while I've seen people claim Draco was a better person that he was, I've never seen anyone recognize he was awful and then claim he was redeemed. It's just that Draco was a mean person and a little shit, but that doesn't mean he deserved at 16 to be set up to watch his family die before being killed himself. If at age 35 Draco was a teacher who treated his students the way Snape treated his, I'd condemn him every bit as harshly."
harrypotter,fpsglx0,t1_fprqhmo,1588873129.0,"Look, James and Sirius were definitely not always stellar people as kids. They were arrogant and didn't always fully comprehend the consequences of their actions, and they definitely picked on Snape. But I also definitely think the evidence points more strongly to the James/Snape relationship being much more like Harry/Draco than a one-sided bullying situation. The fact that James had close friends to back him up meant there was a different power balance, but that's about it. Lupin and Dumbledore both compare Snape's hatred of James to Harry's hatred of Malfoy, and Lupin says Snape never lost an opportunity to hex James.

>But Lupin shook his head. “Did I ever tell you to lay off Snape?” he said. “Did I ever have the guts to tell you I thought you were out of order?”

>“Yeah, well,” said Sirius, “you made us feel ashamed of ourselves sometimes… that was something…”

How is this different from Hermione telling Harry and Ron off for stuff they know they shouldn't be doing? I can definitely see an adult Trio looking back on Harry sneaking into Hogsmeade in PoA and wondering how in the world he could've been so flippant with so many people risking their lives for him.

>And Lily literally calls James a ""bully who hexes people because he can and because they annoy him.""

Lily's also angry in that moment, and she doesn't like James. She's Snape's friend, so she's on his side of this rivalry. Pansy Parkinson might say the same thing to Harry.

>Lupin and Sirius also admit James ""hexed people for fun.""

So do Fred and George. What do you call giving Dudley a Ton-Tongue Toffee, or putting Canary Creams out at a party, or turning Ron's teddy bear into a spider? It's not *nice,* necessarily, but there's a difference between using a mild hex on your friend as a prank and hexing random people because it amuses you.

>Harry tried to make a case for Snape having deserved what he had suffered at James’s hands: but hadn’t Lily asked, “What’s he done to you?” And hadn’t James replied, “It’s more the fact that he exists, if you know what I mean.” Hadn’t James started it all simply because Sirius had said he was bored?

Just because that's the justification James gives Lily doesn't mean that's literally his only justification. He's an arrogant kid who's too big for his boots, and he's showing off. Snape's done plenty to James, James is just pretending to be above it all. Is it nice? No. Does it make him a vicious bully? Also no.

>James Potter and Sirius Black. Apprehended using an illegal hex upon Bertram Aubrey. Aubrey’s head twice normal size.

I think it's perfectly reasonable to interpret 'illegal' in this context to mean ""against Hogwarts rules"" rather than ""against the law."" Swelling someone's head up is pretty mild compared to a lot of what Hogwarts students get away with doing to each other, and this is definitely Filch we're talking about. I mean, he's the one who refers to Harry dripping mud on the floor as ""befouling the castle.""

>While there are only two scenes from that era (and the Marauders were bullies in both, which is very clearly JKR saying... they were bullies)

The point of these scenes isn't to show that the Marauders were bullies, it's for Harry to come to terms with his father's humanity. Most people know their parents are flawed, sometimes even heavily flawed, because they get to see those flaws for themselves. Harry never got to know his parents, never got to have the normal coming-of-age experience that is realizing your parents aren't perfect, that they could be just as guilty of wrongdoing as anyone else you know. Harry's always idolized his dad, and it comes as a heavy blow to realize that his dad was capable of meanness, that he was immature in ways Harry isn't at the same age, that some of what Snape said about his dad was true all along. But that doesn't mean his dad was a bad person. James Potter was brave, loyal, strong, kind, principled, trustworthy. He was also cocky, immature, hot-tempered, and less empathetic than he should have been at 15.

Were the Marauders bullies? Yeah, they definitely bullied Snape the way Malfoy bullies Harry. Were they vicious brutes who terrorized their fellow students for their own amusement? Hardly."

But when I'm dating and looking at what qualities are important to me in a partner, it makes sense if I prefer someone who likes to cook, doesn't it? Like, it's not a thing I *need,* but it's a definite plus. If my partner enjoys cooking, we'll both be happier for it. Cooking is a life skill, and while it's one I can do, it's also one that causes me stress rather than enjoyment. If I prefer a relationship in which cooking's not my job, that doesn't make me un-independent or a bad adult, it just means it's a chore that doesn't play to my strengths.

>I'd just still personally be bothered having to ""pick up slack"" for another person though. Organization and working out take discipline from yourself in the long run. I can't shake the lack of basic life skills (unless its agreed upon of course). I can't be your motivation forever.

There's a difference between lacking basic life skills and having weaknesses. We all have stuff we're good at and stuff we're not. While we can improve skills with practice, it is true that people's brains work differently, and we all have a handful of things we'll just always struggle with. That doesn't mean we *can't* do them, just that they'll never come easily. We all use various methods of support to help us do the things that are harder for us--maybe we set phone alerts if we tend to lose track of time, maybe we study/work with friends if we tend to get distracted, maybe we arrange our stuff in an odd way because it helps us stay organized. The point isn't to do it like everyone else does, the point is to just do it, in whatever works for you.

Leaning on a partner (or a friend or a family member!) is a perfectly valid method of support for things that come harder to you. Having a partner who loves exercise is a good way to help you get to the gym more often. Having a partner who's good at routines will help you set and stick to your own. The whole reason to have a partner is that life is easier and more pleasant when you have someone you love to go through it with. That means leaning on each other for what you need, helping each other day-to-day, giving of each yourselves for one another. It has to go both ways; a relationship where one person has to babysit the other isn't healthy, and neither is a relationship where one person expects the other to be responsible for their behavior. But in a healthy relationship, both people support each other. It makes total sense to seek a partner who provides the things you rely on others for, doesn't it?"

If your friend is telling you what they're going through, be an open and nonjudgmental ear. Tell them their experience sounds hard, you're proud of them for pushing onward, you're here for them if they need anything. Provide support by checking in on them, by helping them get out of the house, by reminding them you care.

If it seems appropriate, or if they start to lean on you too hard, ask if they're seeing a therapist. It's totally okay to tell a friend that while you love them, you're not a professional and can't treat them. ""You know I'm always here for you, but I'm not a mental health expert or anything. Are you seeing a therapist? (Or, ""It really sounds like you should see a therapist."") They can help you work through this a lot better than I can.""

It's also okay to tell a friend if you're not up for supporting them in a given moment. One of the hardest things for me to learn was how to say, ""I love you and I hope you're okay, but I cannot be this person for you tonight. Do you have someone else you can call?""

changemyview,fpqi0rc,t3_geyixo,1588823259.0,"So I do think that people can use the idea of a partner ""complementing"" them as an excuse to avoid self-improvement or to lean to much on someone else for their own wellbeing. But I don't think that's the necessary (or even most common) interpretation of the idea, or that the concept of complementary partners can't be helpful and healthy.

Let's take the example of someone who struggles to work out and wants a partner to motivate them. If they mean they want a parent/babysitter to make them do something they don't want to do, that's no good. But maybe they know they find it easier to stay disciplined when someone holds them accountable, or that they enjoy working out more with a partner who enjoys it themself. In that case, it might be really beneficial to have a partner who likes working out and will encourage them to do the same.

Or what about the forgetting to take meds example. This is likely one behavior in a larger pattern of forgetfulness, disorganization, or executive dysfunction, right? Someone who deals with these things probably wants a partner who doesn't struggle with routines or organization, not just for the meds, but for all the parts of life that require these strengths.

Whenever you're in any kind of partnership with someone, particularly a life partnership, it's useful to have different strengths and 
weaknesses from one another, because it means you can divide tasks in a way that's ultimately easier for both people. For example, I'm living with my sister right now. She's a really good cook, but hates cleaning up the kitchen. I don't mind cleaning up the kitchen, but I find cooking fairly overwhelming and tend to make pretty boring, simple meals because of it. So most of the time, she cooks and I clean up. If we both liked cooking but hated cleaning up, we'd have a bunch of delicious food and a messy kitchen, or we'd have a bunch of delicious food and a clean kitchen but be tired out afterwards. Instead, we have good food, a clean kitchen, and energy after dinner, because we have different preferences and strengths.

That's obviously a pretty minor example, but it works on a larger scale too. If you're expecting your partner to babysit you, that's no good. But if you're looking for a partner who's good at the things you struggle with, and are open for them to struggle with the things you're good at, the two of you will have a better quality of life overall."

That said, I think the age at which a kid can consent to pierced ears is pretty young. My sister and I had them done when we were 3 and 5, and while it was my mom who suggested it, we were on board.

The first time I ever enjoyed Shakespeare was when I finally saw a live production of Romeo & Juliet, which I remember hating in school, but which was suddenly really compelling on stage.

Understanding Shakespearean language is a skill like any other; it requires practice for it to become easy. Watching a performance gives you context for the words; even if you can't exactly parse the sentence, you understand what it means from the actors' delivery and reactions. The more you listen (or listen while reading along!) the more you understand, until you reach a point where you can read the language and still enjoy it without the performance attached.

And if Shakespeare's not ever your thing, that's cool too. But by investing a bit of time into making it easier for yourself, it might  become less of a slog when you do have to interact with it."

Most abusers know how to be charming, to be gallant, to seem like just the nicest partner you've ever had. There's a reason that [love bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_bombing) is so often a part of the cycle of abuse. The abuser waits until their victim is invested in the relationship before abusing them. It usually starts small; minor controlling behaviors, little comments to instill self-doubt, etc. Then they escalate, exercising more control and having bigger and bigger outbursts when angered. This is coupled by gaslighting the victim, isolating them from their friends/family, and lowering their sense of self-worth. By the time the victim realizes this isn't healthy, they're doubting their own perception that it's really that bad, and they're sure they can't make it on their own, they deserve this treatment, it's hopeless to leave, etc.

But the other side of this is that abusers often prey on victims who are already vulnerable. There are lots of reasons someone may not immediately react badly to a partner who's slightly controlling or manipulative. If they grew up in an unhealthy home, they may not know certain behaviors are wrong or even abnormal. If they have low self-esteem, they may be more willing to put up with bad behavior to keep a partner they think is ""out of their league"" or who's better than they deserve."

It sounds like you've got interests and hobbies; do you know that there are also women interested in stuff like art, history, and traveling? When you meet a girl you think is cute, ask her what she does with her time, what she's studying, what she wants to do with her life. And when she tells you, be interested in her answer. If it's something you know lots about, then the two of you can talk about more complicated aspects of the subject than you're able to with folks who aren't as familiar with it. If she's into things you don't know much about, ask! Most people want to talk about their hobbies and passions; let her teach you, and tell her about yours.

Theatre,fph26ad,t3_gc96kc,1588613644.0,"I think theatre is about everyone involved. The reason live theatre is different from a movie or a book or any other type of entertainment is that the artists and the audience are all there together, sharing an experience and interacting with one another. Ideally, every audience member, every actor, every designer, every crew member will get something out of the production. Obviously that's hard to accomplish, particularly when you're talking about thousands of people, but it is the goal.

>No one can appreciate a play like someone inside the production.

I don't know that I agree with this. Every person who interacts with the production will experience it differently, but I don't think one experience is inherently better than another. The performers and director will get the deepest into the nuances of the text and the characters. The director and designers will have best understanding of how each scene, moment, character contributes to the overall story, and how to evoke what they want to evoke in an audience. The stage managers, crew, producers, and front of house staff have the bird's eye view what it takes to actually make the performance happen, to get butts in seats and bodies onstage, to coordinate all the pieces into something seamless. The audience will experience the emotional impact of the play most strongly, witnessing each moment fully fleshed out without knowing how it will unfold.

None of these experiences are inherently better, more important, or  more meaningful than any of the others. It's just down to a matter of preference. Perhaps what you love about theatre is the deep text work, the camaraderie in a rehearsal room or backstage, the feeling of delivering a particular emotional experience to an audience. In that case, acting is the way you prefer to experience theatre, and that's awesome. What I enjoy most is the community and the craft; I love seeing how artists and technicians go about creating something so magical. That's why I love being a stage manager and an audience member, but would enjoy less being an actor (missing out on so much design and logistics) or a director/designer (missing out on the experience of a live performance).

Theatre absolutely is for the makers. We do it because we get something out of it, and our experience has value. But theatre isn't *just* for the makers. The audience is a necessary part of it, and their experience also matters."
socialjustice101,fpgywuu,t3_gdbohi,1588611984.0,"I think the two types of ""victimhood"" are best handled differently. The whole ""the Irish are nonwhite/oppressed too"" thing is pretty straightforward. You explain that racial categories are arbitrary and therefore can fluctuate. While the Irish were historically seen as nonwhite, that's no longer true. This means that modern, ethnically Irish Americans may be affected by oppression of their ancestors--it's less likely that they have old family money, for example--but are not themselves discriminated against. When it comes to cultural appropriation, inequality is an inherent part of it. While you should of course never use aspects of anyone's culture to make fun of them, cultural *appropriation* requires that the culture in question be an oppressed minority. We strive for a world in which everyone can wear whatever they like; the reason it's sometimes not okay now is that it's a dick move to wear/use something whose creators are still oppressed for creating it. Non-Irish wearing shamrocks for St. Patrick's Day is what we *want* to have happen, that all people can celebrate a particular culture together and with respect.

When it comes to individual experiences, I think it's more complicated. In my experience, the best route is to take the person 100% seriously. That doesn't necessarily mean agreeing with them that non-abusive behaviors were abusive, but in acting like they were negatively affected by these behaviors, whether or not you think that makes any sense. You can say, ""I don't know that I'd call that abusive behavior, but it was clearly really hurtful in a way that you're still dealing with."" Encourage them to seek therapy, explain that they get to define what kind of relationship they want to have with toxic relatives, tell them you hope they're able to work through past trauma and find healthy ways to move forward. Above all, treat them as if this does not define who they are. They don't need your pity or to be treated like they're fragile, they just need your support and acceptance. If they really were so negatively affected by these childhood experiences, then this is just solid advice and shows them there's a way forward. If they're manufacturing victimhood for attention, this isn't the type of attention they're looking for. People who are manufacturing victimhood want sympathy and status, not advice for how to fix the problem or move forward."

As far as the types of jobs crew members can have, there are lots. Anything that involves an onstage transition is referred to as a ""shift."" This can be something as minor as striking a chair and as major as a full set change. To ""set"" an object is to put it onstage, and to ""strike"" it is to take it offstage. If the theatre has a fly rail with which to bring things in and out from above, the crew may ""fly"" objects as part of a shift.

If a crew member needs to take a prop, costume, or set piece from one offstage location to another offstage location, it's referred to as ""tracking"" that item. If you don't have a separate wardrobe crew, deck crew members may also be responsible for ""costume changes"" or ""quick changes"" that actors cannot accomplish on their own.

This means no stability, but it also means that you have a chance every time to show why you're the right person for the part.

In my experience, a resume is useful background information on an actor, not the primary thing directors care about. Your resume shows things like how long you've been doing this (ie what can we expect to still have to teach you in rehearsal), the range of characters you've played (are you pretty flexible, or do you just have one or two things you do), who you've worked with (so we can ask them how you were as a colleague), etc. These things can tip the scales one way or another, but what matters is what you bring to the audition room, because that tells them more about how you'll be than anything on your resume can."
Theatre,fpfirxu,t1_fpafpha,1588572512.0,"There's still a question of work schedules. Having worked with teenagers in a professional theatre environment, it's a lot for them to take on. They're usually balancing school with rehearsals and performances, and while you can do things like hold rehearsals in the evenings, a full work week will still either infringe on the end of their school day or keep them out very late, and that's without getting into when they can do their homework. You pretty much need to have a kid, family, and school that are willing to make it work, and that just doesn't give you a lot of options if you're not on Broadway. A regional theatre in a mid-sized city doesn't have hundreds of professional child actors lining up to audition.

Furthermore, even if you can work with the child labor laws regarding work hours and double casting, there are other logistical things to take into account. You need to budget for a child wrangler, and you may need to provide separate dressing rooms. That's fine if you've got a cast of several adults and several children, but if you've just got one kid and limited space, that can be a pretty significant hurdle. Working with children is also inherently different from working with adults (less so the older they get, but still). It can be useful to have an actor who's a few years older than the character, because they have the maturity to fully examine that character but still appear young enough to play them.

There are many times when casting children is a great choice, particularly for shows with many child characters. It can be a great experience for child actors, and it can lend to a more authentic production. But there's also a lot of hassle that comes with it. If you can find an 18-year-old who convincingly plays 15, your life is a hell of a lot easier."

Sansa's not close to Jon, but she does consider him a sibling, if only a half-sibling. Jaime and Cersei were separated for several years, but they did spend childhood together and also knew they were siblings. The point is that when Jon and Daenerys met, they didn't know they were family, and they hadn't had any previous life together. If someone had said, ""Hey Jon, this is your Aunt Daenerys,"" he probably wouldn't have ever slept with her. He might have still thought she was hot, but probably would've immediately squashed that thought with, ""ew, no, she's my aunt, get it together."" As it was, he was attracted to her before he knew she was a blood relative.

With Daenerys, sexual feelings developed as they would with any other non-relative adult he'd just met. With Sansa, he'd be developing sexual feelings for someone he'd known a long time and knew to be family.

Like, sleeping with an adopted sibling might be less gross than sleeping with a biological sibling, but only by a little bit. They're still your sibling. Jon and Sansa grew up together, believing they were brother and sister. That affects how they view one another. Sansa being attracted to Jon isn't substantially different from her being attracted to Robb, or Jon to Arya.

Jon and Daenerys, on the other hand, met as adults who believed they were not related at all. In the same way, that affects how they view one another. Jon isn't going, ""That's my Aunt Daenerys, she's hot,"" he's going, ""That's this lady Daenerys, she's hot."" The fact that they share blood means people may still be squicked out by them actually sleeping together, but it's less weird for them to be *attracted* to one another because they developed that attraction over a substantial amount of time where they didn't know they were family.

gameofthrones,fpakx3t,t1_fp93yyg,1588450288.0,"Generally speaking, nudity is something that is part of contract negotiations for film actors. For shows where it's applicable, actors and their agents are able to include clauses that stipulate what kinds of on-screen nudity they're comfortable with and what they're not. It's not relevant for underage actors, but on a show like Game of Thrones, it would be a standard thing to include on any contracts covering time after the actor's 18th birthday. Iirc Game of Thrones contracts covered only a season at a time, so it's not like it was a big ""now you're 18, better draw up a nudity clause"" thing, it was more like, ""time to work on this year's contract, which contains some new clauses since you're of age.""

I'm sure it's weird to talk about and film mature content with someone you've known since they were a kid. A few actors (I won't give you names because spoilers) have talked in interviews about how certain scenes in later seasons were hard to do with an 18-year-old they met at 12 or whatever. But at the same time, child actors do grow up and have to be treated like the adults they are. Just because I'm uncomfortable that you used to be 12 doesn't mean you're 12 anymore, and it doesn't mean you still want to be treated like a child.

There's a reason the show's quality generally dropped once it outran the books, and I think it's that while D&D are great at adapting and even fleshing out existing work (ie scenes like Robert and Cersei's conversation) they not as great at writing their own stories. Ultimately it's two overlapping but distinct skillsets. It's almost like the difference between writing fanfiction and writing original fiction. You have plenty of people who are good at both, but you also have plenty of people who can only do one. D&D have the fanfiction writer's ability to interpret and flesh out existing characters, and to know what those characters will do even when placed in new situations. That's why stuff like Arya's relationship with Tywin feels true to both characters, even though none of that material happens in the books. However, D&D struggle when given a blank slate.

Most of it is subplots or character development, but occasionally they just don't tell you stuff you need to know. For example, at no point in the films does anyone explain that James and his friends were the Marauders or why they had those nicknames. When Harry says to Snape in OotP, ""He's got Padfoot,"" it's the first and only time anyone uses the name 'Padfoot' to refer to Sirius.

That said, I think gatekeeping is stupid, and having a sense of superiority over people who've only seen the movies is both useless and unkind.

He placed Harry's physical wellbeing over his emotional wellbeing--something he does frequently throughout the novels, most notably with both Harry and Sirius in OotP. While obviously mental health doesn't matter much if you're dead, there were other solutions that would keep Harry both alive and better cared for, particularly after a few years, when it became clear Voldemort's supporters were going into hiding, at least for the time being.

socialjustice101,foutwqe,t3_g80iwb,1588090335.0,"I think there's a difference between writing fiction as a moral treatise and writing fiction that takes its context into account.

When you're writing a fantasy novel, you get to create your own world. If this is a world ruled by a monarchy, it makes sense for your characters to operate in the context of monarchy. If there are multiple belief systems, particularly if some of those belief systems encourage violence or abuse, members of different factions may have conflict. If it's a world with terrifying and deadly monsters, violence may be necessary for survival. None of that is inherently bad. You can create the world you want to create.

That said, it's important to think about the context in which your readers interact with your story. If your hero perceives the monster as a threat not because of anything it does, but simply because it's ugly and powerful, what does that say about your hero's morals? How will that come off to a reader who is regularly perceived as threatening based on their appearance, such as a large black man or a trans woman? What about your biases made you portray these actions as justified or heroic?

Or let's take the evil cult example. What about this fantasy cult makes it evil? Are you drawing any parallels to behaviors of real-world religions? How do the heroes talk about this cult? Are they critical of the behavior, or are they critical of what they perceive as blashphemy? Are all members of this cult evil, or are there members who push back against more extreme practices? Are there other religious groups in your world with whom our heroes interact positively?

We already use real-world morality and implications to influence how we write fantasy. We don't write a hero who beats his wife, even if he lives in a fantasy society where wife-beating is normal, because our readers won't accept him as a hero. Similarly, we should look at the implications of our fantasy world and see if they're built on harmful stereotypes or oppressive power structures. We can trust our readers to be smart enough to distinguish between right and wrong in different contexts, but we should also respect them enough not to use their identities in ways that promote or normalize their oppression."

And I don't think it's on Bonnie Wright, who does a creditable job with the few moments she's given. I think it's completely on the writers and directors for basically just removing Ginny from the story except as a last-minute love interest.

Book Ginny is a quiet little girl who grows into a feisty, smart, badass teenager while none of her brothers are paying attention. Movie Ginny is barely even an actual person."

Like, even if you're looking at it from a strictly capitalist, value-creation perspective, it's impossible to create a billion dollars worth of value in a lifetime, let alone a decade or two. If you've amassed billions of dollars, then other people have necessarily earned most of that money for you, but because you're in charge of dividing it up via paychecks, you're keeping more than your share.

There's also the argument that at some point, wealth inequality becomes immoral. Some level of wealth inequality is inevitable in any kind of free society, but at some point the disparities become unreasonable. If you have 1,000 apples and your neighbor is starving, you should give them an apple. It doesn't matter how hard you worked for the apples, it doesn't matter how useful you are to society relative to your neighbor. You cannot eat 1,000 apples before they go bad. Your neighbor is starving and you can fix it without even feeling the difference."
