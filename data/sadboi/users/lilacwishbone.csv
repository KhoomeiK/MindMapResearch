You are very young still. There is no shame in taking your time, and no shame in taking some ""wrong"" steps to discovering your sexuality. It is also okay to change labels until you find one that suits you. Several trans women I know actual experienced that their gender preference changed during their transition, and they were all well into their twenties.

1. Dead men tell tales: Three people get designated a role (milk man, snow white, or something). Theyre all dead but have arisen to tell the story of how they died. They take turns telling a small chunk of the story from their point of view. The game ends when the story explains how theyve all died. They must all be killed by the same incident. You may add a rule that they cant say one of the others has died.

2. Press conference: One person is chosen to be the main character. Without this person hearing, everyone else agrees on who this person is and why they have called for a press conference (e.g. the pot would like to make a public apology for calling the kettle black). When you're ready, everyone except the main characters will act as journalists asking vague questions about the incident and the main character must attempt to answer, and eventually try to guess who they are and what the story is. When I've played it the journalists like to announce their name and magazine/channel/blog as little punny hints. 
If you're unable to send the main character outside, have some pre prepared notes to draw out of a hat and show the journalists."
