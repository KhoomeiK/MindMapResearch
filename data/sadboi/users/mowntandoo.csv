I’m playing with a buddy now so I may roll a rogue my next run very soon to try it out and see if the extra cash is worth it.

Syncing is also dramatically better - I had a lot of issues syncing to my iPad with Emby and zero issues when I moved back to Plex. There are few things worse than getting on a plane, opening your iPad for the flight, you play the movie and after about 30 seconds it jumbles and crashes."
