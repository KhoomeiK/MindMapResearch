relationship_advice,fqpbct2,t1_fqpayb7,1589541520.0,Awh no worries. u can always pm me if u rlly need to vent. Is there not any one of ur army bros that are a less ‘hardcore’ and feel u could talk to them about her. It might be good to talk to them as they know her ? you never know how they will respond. They might relate or have gone through the same as u before
relationship_advice,fqp9z75,t3_gk6vzr,1589540236.0,"Ur doing everything perfect. it may be really hard and u might feel like u’ll never get over her but u will 100% find someone else to replace her. u might think she’s the epitome of perfect or whatever but i promise u will fund someone better. It may take time or it may not. Also time helps to heal. U will be over her just give it time. I’m sorry u feel so terrible but it will get better :,)"

School is overwhelming as shit and it isn't rude to ask him for space. You need to ensure you feel okay.He will understand as he just took his finals, also i love ur username !"

relationship_advice,fqlnoyy,t3_gjm3ph,1589462458.0,"So I think that it isn't pointless. Although having a good relationship with your partner's parents is a good thing, the parents view on you as a couple should not effect how pointless ur relationship . I know this is very different but couples which are part of the LGBT community might have to hide their relationship from their parents because they are scared but it they are still happy together."
