Save absolutely anything you can between now and doing it. Another way is a 2nd part time job in the evenings/ weekends.

Sure it's hard but retraining is hard when you are older and have responsibilities. When I retrained, I was at college Monday to Friday 9 to 5 and did at least 3 hours study every evening. I was only on £600 per month and had to pay for 2x accommodations (my own home and a room near the college). I worked a 2nd job weekends where I would work 30 hours (2x 15 hour shifts). I would also have to study at work as there wasn't enough hours in the week.

After 3 years I had to have 2 months off to rest. If i was to do it again i would save as much as i could to enable me to not have to have a job as well but i started the course as i was unemployed and had nothing.

Blackpool is also an experience if you have never been. 

The best part about Salford is the M602. Within minutes you are on the M6 to go up or down. When you have to go out East, it's a ball ache on the small roads which are now mostly 30.

Do your research though in Salford. As with most cities there are nice areas and not so nice areas. There are also well connected areas and not very well connected parts all right next to each other. The train is incredibly unreliable and the Metrolink doesn't serve much of Salford.

You will also be in a bit of a culture shock as public transport can be almost non existent on sundays, early mornings and through the night. So double check the area you want to live in is commutable for your work and schedule. Some places are fine though.

Also there might be a way later to gain the extra credits by working in the field and doing that way but I think this is more complicated and you'd need to speak to your university. I'm also not sure how long credits would be valid for.

My friend got kicked out of university in his 3rd year (it's a long story). Anyway that was like 6 years ago. He wasn't that bothered as he was doing the job he wanted to get anyway.

He called the university to see if he could transfer his credits and they were all like well you actually have enough for a degree without honours if you want. 

All that aside. There is plenty you can do without a degree. Many people succeed without one. Apprenticeships seem to be the easiest way to get in somewhere on the bottom rung.

When I started there was quite a few Brits and a handful of Hong Kong and eastern Europeans. But by the time I left, there was a lot more foreign people and very few Brits. 

My experience wasn't too bad. We either had our own rooms or we shared with 1 other (there was 1 room with 3 beds). Every year, we generally changed room. As I was the longest serving in the girls, I generally got first pick, or a least a huge influence. 

We were also lucky as our boarding house was on an activity centre site so twice a week we got to do activities with the centre for free such as go-karting, trampolining, archery, high ropes etc. 

Every Friday we had a trip to the supermarket and mc Donald's for snacks. Saturday was a trip to the main town for cinema and/or shopping. We could have sleep overs in each other rooms. Often we would everyone take their mattress and all sleep in 1 room. We could also have our friends from school who were day pupils come and stay too. Or we could go to a friends house.

Sunday was cook your own brunch which was fun. We made some amazing breakfast Sandwiches.

On school nights, we would have ""prep"" time or homework from 7pm till 8pm. Anyone year 10 and below had to go to the prep room but year 10 upwards you got a desk in your room. But the teachers would still go round to check you are working.

Then your bed time was by school year up to 11pm in 6th form where you just had to be quiet in your room.

AskUK,fofwkqo,t1_fofv7ja,1587744077.0,"There are plenty of jobs out there. There is nothing wrong with asking on here.

It's not hopeless. A job is not going to just fall in your lap though. Degrees mean little these days and not having one doesn't matter (except in a very small number of specialised positions). You have to go out there and find it.

I've had to walk in to offices personally to hand in my CV. I've had to bombard people with emails directly. I've had to network so much that I now feature in almost every edition of my industry newspaper, just to get my name out there. I go to talks and seminars, I've spent thousands of pounds on additional courses in the hope of getting the job I want and I spend hundreds of pounds each year being members of different organisations within the industry for networking purposes.

I've had to work harder than most, sure. And I have felt like you have at times. But doing nothing is not going help you. If you feel not having a degree is holding you back, then go get one. I have 2. In fact I've found it harder to get a job with a degree than before I had one.

There are loads of apprenticeships now in all different industries to start in entry level. You can literally pick anything."

If you are just working in the 1 job, employed by the employer the  you probably won't need to do anything except double check your payslip when you get your first wage.

When you do get a pay slip, double check the tax code. Quite often, you get emergency taxed (which is slightly more than usual) in the first pay check if they didn't get some info. They balance it back out again but it's really easy to Google tax codes if that does happen.

When you start working, your employer normally gives you a form to fill in where you have to tick a box if it's you only job etc.

You would only need to do self assessment if you have other incomes (such as rent from a 2nd home) or like in my case, I'm taxed through PAYE and normally wouldn't have to do anything further but I get some tax exemptions through my job so I can claim back some of my tax that was paid."

Another question is what your entitlement to work in the UK is. If you don't already have permission to work live and work here, you will need a Visa. Getting a visa can be difficult.

Honestly though the money isn't as good as it used to be. Sure there are some good paying areas, I'm on £30k as a 3rd mate on ferries but the average is more realistically £25k these days. The only thing making it worth it is the tax exemptions.

If it's the travelling you want to do then I would always recommend cruise, especially as a cadet when you ha e more free time.

You will get an unlimited ticket but it's not so easy to switch around if you haven't got relevant experience and other specific certificates which are expensive to self fund.

For tankers, you need an endorsement and while it's not impossible to do post cadetship, it is far easier to get it with your cadetship. So I tend to say to people if you want to work on tankers, you do your cadetship on tankers."

You will need a travel adapter and unless you know for sure what kind of plug they use, on of those with all of them on is best. I recommend having 2x of those and taking with you and extension lead (the thing that make 4 devices plug into 1 socket).

If you use a hairdryer then you can buy dual voltage ones especially but the standard hairdryers are usually 220v if you are in Europe.

Pretty much everything else will be compatible on both 110v and 220v.

An example:

I'm from the UK. We use 240v and have a unique plug.

Ship I was a cadet on was Taiwanese owned, British flagged and had US plugs and 110v. Had to buy a dual voltage hairdryer.

Ship I'm on now, although British, uses European plugs and 220v. So all my stuff works fine but I need a travel adapter."

However if it's a small ship, you dont want to be making too much noise so some good headphones are also good.

My friend takes his xbox but you may or may not have a TV in your cabin. If you know this might be an option.

If you are deep sea then a second or even 3rd phone that is unlocked and able to use foreign sim cards unless ofcourse you will have free wifi on board. Although more common, it's still hit and miss where the company or ship has it.

Check the voltage of the power on the ship. Most devices will work on both 220v and 110v but some things such as my hairdryer and electric toothbrush didn't. 

If you take an extension lead, you only need 1 power adapters. Again, if you use a hairdryer, check the adapter island capable. I blew one up once. The ship might not have the same power sockets as your country.

I also second everything the other guys said about hard drives."
