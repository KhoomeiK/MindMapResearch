depression,fblcx0c,t3_edsmnj,1576961227.0,I thot yesterday it's a miracle I haven't killed myself yet...but the closest I've come to death has been several times being my story is a bit dark I do drugs and hang out it not so nice areas but besides where I've almost been killed there...the real closest I've come to death was when I was literally one step ahead of a truck barreling taking a left hand turn on a small highway where I felt the heat coming from it and I was able to sidestep it at the last moment..  I had headphones on and probably haven't worn any since that was 12 years ago and I still feel my death on that day I don't think about it all the time but I did yesterday for some reason and it does not feel good to die because in another universe I did get hit by that truck and dying is not something that feels good...because  I can imagine how it would feel to be hit by a huge commercial truck and dying in that way all deaths are different but the end result is the same it would have been an accidental but who's to say that even tho someone deliberately takes their life in the moment that maybe had that person lived something anything later on may have happened that would change your mind and say years later that yeah taking my own life was an accident even tho in the moment it was not
