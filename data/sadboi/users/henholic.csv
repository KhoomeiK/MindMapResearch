Saying things like ""It'll be okay"", ""You're not right"", ""But you can do that and that"" isn't helpful, it feels like you don't understand them, but at the same time allowing them to just brood deeper and deeper will do more harm, because they'll feel like even being with someone understanding and supportive doesn't help in finding way out. This is very hard to balance and if you have never experienced depression, it might be difficult for you. Show them irrationality in their logic, but if that's not helping, don't insist, because they might think you're mocking them. Try to convince them to see specialist, this is the best they can do.

Thing that helped me the most was ""positive nihilism"". It says that nothing matters and you have no purpose in life, which is easily accepted in such state, but it also says that if there are no obligations, you can do whatever you want - there's no wrong way if there's no right way. One of my favourite quotes:

>*The ex-suicide opens his front door, sits down on the steps, and laughs. Since he has the option of being dead, he has nothing to lose by being alive. It is good to be alive. He goes to work because he doesn't have to.*

Thoughts like ""I can always kill myself if this won't work"", ""I can kill myself anytime, doing it later won't change my chances for death, but I might experience something nice before that"" kept me going through years of hard mental work, including meds and therapy. I cautiously recommend them, even though they might look too negative to someone healthy.

That said, if you feel like their negativity gets into you and your own mental health is in danger, don't force yourself into it. You're not responsible for their decisions. You tried to help, you did your best, but you can't be a good firefighter if you're in flames yourself. I would be devastated if I knew that person who helped me, got into same bad place because of me."
