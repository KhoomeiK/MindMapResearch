That spread to someone I considered to be akin to a brother yelling at me along with that friend who I was having a conundrum with.  Under the pressure of me unintentionally hurting someone (be it emotionally) and the pressure being put towards me with statements including ""You we're trying to make them look bad!"" made break under pressure and admit to something I didn't have any intention to do.

Even if they were to get more open in rexruitment, the amount of population loss in terms of people who can easily sustain a military carrer (current generation and the oncoming generation).  I'd say it would be better for NATO to do several things,

1. Keep defensive systems somewhat close to the Russian Border In Europe and Japan and Australia (despite them not being in NATO, they can be considered a good strategic Ally)

2. Keep a close eye on Chinese Interactions, which should be tough but US-Viet relations have warmed and considering their Surprising Rivalry against them.  It would make sense for both NATO and Vietnam to have similar interests when it Comes to China.

3.  Prevent Chinese Corprate and Political Infiltrations. China is only Maoist in name which is obvious at this point.  While Corprate ventures are good, there are certain and rather..... unwanted ones.  In other words 50cent, which owns a majority of Chinese Social Related Services and whose CEO is part of the Chinese Parliament.  They have been known to work with Western Companies, the ones I can remember most recently being Ubisoft, a French AAA Gaming Corperation and Blizzard, an American AAA Gaming Corperation set on the Western Coast.  Their attempts to enter into China were met with backlash, due to Chinese censoring and high up users and personalities criticising their actions in Hong Kong by banning them from a tournament and then stating a half hearted apology.
