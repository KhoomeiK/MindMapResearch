She has schizophrenia, for some people it's a really debilitating disease. Maybe you should lower your expectations of how people should act or be."
schizophrenia,ep5idej,t3_btuuhp,1559056383.0,"This is why you should never tell anyone at work you have schizophrenia, you will get labeled. Him having sz may not be the reason you two have problems. When it comes to work or even in the real world, not everyone will get along and have a good time together. Even if you try to be nice and polite, it might piss him off even more. If you really like the job then by all means stay and just be cordial with the guy. You know good morning or goodnight and that's it, no light conversations. But if there gonna be negativity here and there everytime you see each other then I would leave."

schizophrenia,eoj7eaa,t3_broqar,1558634054.0,"I think the opposite of paranoia is the truth, it's either one or the other. Which kinda sucks because if it's the truth, ok that's cool. But if it's paranoia then haha that dude is crazy. People will always remember the negatives before the positive."
schizophrenia,eoivoqj,t3_brvftx,1558628267.0,"I read a study that most of us die earlier from lung cancer as that's our real medication. I don't have a link but yeah you can look it up, smoking is actually good for people with schizophrenia, it apparently calms the brain. I only smoke a pack a day, which is the same as before I developed schizophrenia."
schizophrenia,eoitycq,t3_brywlr,1558627245.0,"Honestly bro, I don't know how it is growing up in a broken home. I was opposite in terms wanting to see my family while in the hospital. If he is having delusions about his family members, that's not good at all. What you're gonna have to do is sit down with him, one on one and have a face to face real conversation with him. Just tell him you love him, that's it."
