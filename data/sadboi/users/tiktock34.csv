In nearly all large publishing, you as the author sign away your rights to that article as part of the process.

You can go ahead and post manuscripts and such, but not the final, peer reviewed, Verison-of-record that in many cases needs to be used for a variety of commercial and heavy research, FDA submission, etc.  Notice on every single article the copyright statement and it doesnt list the author.  They are just the author in most cases.  If you write a paper for your university, for instance, you aren't going to own the copyright and retain the rights to decide how its distributed, licensed or that you'll potentially profit from that research.  Your university or its university press that publishes that research is the copyright holder.  Its no different thatn if you innovate at work.  Developer working at your company and come up with a new algorithm or code that might be worth tons?  You dont ""own"" a single line of that code.

You aren't negotiating rights with a big publisher for academic papers.  You agree to their terms of submission, or you dont.  You can choose to pay to publish with them OA to offset their publication costs and then control aspects of the licensing options but that also comes with a rabbit hole of various creative commons licensing options and you can bet your top dollar the publisher retains commercial re-use rights in many cases.

For instance you can clearly see here that if you publish with Elsevier you sign you copyright over to them outside OA:

[https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright](https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/copyright)

In that agreement and transfer of ownership and rights they subsequently *""allow""* you to retain uses as the author. They are quite literally *allowing* authors to send you copies.  The authors arent the rightsholder anymore.

The next quagmire comes from authors saying ""i have to pay for access to my own article!"" usually right after they quite literally sign over the rights to that article to those commercial publishers.  There's a significant argument about the ""cost to publish"" and how much profits commercial publishers make, too.

Forget the fact that NONE of this ""free"" data implies rights.  NONE.  There are ZERO rights implied by even the legal access being granted in this pandemic.

Losing a baby is literally inconceivable in terms of coping to someone who has never gone through it.  Everyone is plainly aware there are no ""itll be okay"" or ""its for the best"" or ""they lived a full life"" or anything like that and I think people become paralyzed about what to say, how to comfort and how NOT to make the situation worse.  To be honest, the hardest parts of mourning to me were when good-intentioned people tried to help me through things in ways that I rejected.  A relative who was religious told me it was all part of God's plan knowing full well I didn't go to church.  It took everything to not spit in their face but to them, that was the most gracious and kind thing they could offer when there was nothing else to offer but distanced, general support.

My advice is try not to be too hard on others.  Like grieving, people need to work through things on their own.  This is an impossible situation for them.  Some of my most powerful support came after the insanity of grief ended and that person finally had the opportunity to say what they really wanted to say but couldnt with an open wound in both your and their hearts.  You see posts here as much by people asking what the right way to support a loved one as those who have lost and its clear that people struggle with how to approach someone and what to say when the worst happens, especially remotely.

Support also comes in weird forms.  Almost 9 months after our loss my 90+ year old holocaust surviving grandfather commented on my loss for the first and last time.  I wondered why he hadn't reached out before.  He found a quiet moment and said something to the effect of ""once again life proves to be a cruel bastard"" and that was it.  Coming from him, knowing he saw horrors, buried his son, buried his wife...it was close as someone saying ""i know how you feel and you're not alone"" as possible without actually taking that leap that others insulting tried to do to comfort me.

THis is a ramble but my main point is that these situations are impossible to prepare for and to react to for everyone involved.  Its not a ""normal"" loss that people have developed techniques to cope with and support others.  There's no appropriate social hierarchy around saying the right things about a tiny 2"" urn like one might say about a 95 year old person who passes in their sleep. Assume good intent and that the people who loved you before wouldn't stop just because you are a victim.  If anything they love you and care for you even more and simply cant express or figure out what to do.

Hang in there.  Your heart is right in transferring your loss into an appreciation of life.  Its all we can really do in the end, right?"

It would have been worse” argument is tough there.

Im not arguing against healthcare.  Im arguing thats a separate argument and would have honestly a negligible effect on the tidal wave of viral infections coming.  Even if universal care removed each and every person from their beds tomorrow wed still be screwed.  Less screwed?  No one knows...last i checked countries with systems like you described are not doing measurably better at controlling human behavior and viral spread outside Lockdown protocols which have zero to so with how universal a health system exists. A nationwide lockdown a week ago would exponentially help this virus more than overhauling the entire system of healthcare.

Its the wrong time to argue for universal healthcare imho...thats all.  But i get the desire, regardless of how little I personally think it intersects with a once in a century plus World pandemic’s results ."

If what you say is true and people avoid hospitals due to cost wed have even MORE in hospitals right now, and even if they belong there that does zero to improve the covid situation.

If every person with mild corona symptoms jetted off to the ER we would be even more screwed.

That means everyone with mild symptoms wont be tested and will probably go out.  The people that do go get tested and are positive will just find out something they can't control.  The people that do go get tested and test negative better be going back a week later as they were probably most exposed while they went to get tested.  Downward spiral.  Forget all the healthy people that have ""normal"" reasons to go to the ER or hospital and now get infected...probably a higer population of ""risky"" people there, too.

IMHO they need to physcially separate those that could have this from everyone else....across the board.
