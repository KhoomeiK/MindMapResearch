AskWomen,fi9sbzx,t3_f723hs,1582279893.0,"I'm not blaming it in my mom because I understand the concern. Basically she doesn't let me walk home late at night by myself and similar situations like that.

It took her some time to let me travel by bus to different cities too.

As I said it bothered me but I can't really blame her, and I do like walking home with someone late at night rather than being by myself so I don't complain a lot about that one.

It's annoying and unfair but that's just the world."

I'm really glad it got a lot of recognition."
