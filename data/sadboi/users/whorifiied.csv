also [here](https://youtu.be/w3Fhmwy6Pp4) is the video

edit: I also noticed that she is triple S rank but as far as I've seen from the beta the other skill that requires double s rank only increases her burst mode by 5 seconds"
houkai3rd,fns0n5c,t1_fnrq12n,1587208733.0,first of all where have you heard she's bad? I saw in a video where she got 31k score against jizo in memorial and people call that bad?
