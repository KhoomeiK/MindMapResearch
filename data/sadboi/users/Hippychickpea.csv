AskReddit,fl0ayrn,t1_fl094wa,1584699435.0,This is where it gets thick. We grew up too fast and both our parents sucked and so we had intense emotions all the time. Teenagers feel untouchable by death so they typically take risks and our life was mayhem. We drank more alcohol than water and picked fights to make the time pass. We beat each other up and acted irrational and only one of us saw the pattern. It tore my heart out but i had to go to stay alive and i carry guilt for that. Broken children grow into broken adults

He was my best friend in the world but he was so so bad for me. At the time i would've said i felt breathless bc he WAS my oxygen but I kept going through motions and then life got better.

socialskills,fktnngm,t3_fkne5f,1584528005.0,"Compliments are a conversation starter I feel like. It sets the stage in the best way usually as long as its genuine. Ex: If someones hair looks different take notice. This is a  blanket assumption but most girls I knew let the men drive the conversation. It turns really repetitve really fast. If someone isnt invested on their end of the interaction its going to get stale and the good news is thats not your problem üåº
Talk about things that make you happy even if it feels weird. You may find overlaps in interests and things will fall out of place. Sorry for the novel but im a nervous nelly myself and i want to tell you that fear of rejection in any form is so normal. Our own egos are sneaky by amplifying these fears at the worst of times.
