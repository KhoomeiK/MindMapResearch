Every thing we do assigns value to something. We have an abundance of options at every single moment and the things we choose to do automatically assigns value to those things over something else. We can’t NOT assign value to things, either consciously or subconsciously. I prefer to at least examine the things I do and why I choose them over other things to determine what my value system is. It’s almost like discovering what your system of values is, rather than creating it—but I think these two things go hand in hand.

explainlikeimfive,fmhuw5t,t1_fmhj2hn,1586094198.0,"I’m a recovering addict and have been through about two years of treatment, so I know a thing or two about addiction response mechanisms. Basically, sugar, chocolate, caffeine, etc release dopamine in your brain. This one of the chemicals stimulated by drugs like cocaine, heroin, and even meth (although meth is primarily seretonergic). Dopamine is one of our “feel good” hormones and basically tells your body “yes this is good”. As your brain becomes conditioned to this dopaminergic response, you produce and release less natural dopamine and require more chemical stimulation to release dopamine in your system. This is the case whether you’re addicted to caffeine, heroin, or exercise. A lack of dopamine causes all sorts of withdrawal symptoms including cravings. It doesn’t matter what the substance is, the dopamine response is similar (I wouldn’t say the same because I’m absolutely positive you get more dopamine response from slamming 60 units of heroin and cocaine in your neck than you do from eating a chocolate bar). The mechanisms are similar enough that you can develop a full on addiction with withdrawals, cravings, etc. to just about any substance or activity that elicits a dopamine response. This can even lead to some physical dependency as without it, your brain has way beyond normal levels of dopamine and that makes it difficult to function."

Our only heat was from a propane heater we kept inside (definitely a bad idea, we’re lucky we didn’t pass out and die but the alternative was to freeze to death with 3ft of snow outside). After my methhead landlord kicked us out at 2am, we resorted to hotel hopping when I could hustle up money and bought a tent. We’d have to constantly move our spot, camping sometimes in places that were illegal. We lived in basically constant fear that a park ranger would realize we were living at the parks and kick us out because you can only camp so many times in so many days. If it’s cold, you’re cold. If it’s hot, you’re hot. And you have nowhere else to go. After not having eaten for two days, when it’s cold outside, the last thing you want to do is shiver in a tent all night until you can get up and do enough meth to get enough energy to go find something to eat. The hotels were a blessing when we could manage it. I don’t really have any terrifying stories, but it was just overall an awful experience. Knowing you have absolutely nowhere else to go and no way to get food overnight and you’re cold, hungry, exhausted, but wired on dope because everyone around you is doing it and it’s dirt cheap out there is a terrible experience.

AskReddit,fm0u955,t1_fm0tpgf,1585666282.0,"Long story short, I studied a lot of different religions/philosophy/mythologies in college. Basically came to the conclusion that the Bible was just another nice story trying to explain the world. There’s more to it than that really, but that’s when I initially converted from Christianity to deism. From there, I basically set out to see what atheists were saying so I could try to disprove their lack of belief with my own belief, and basically found myself coming to the conclusion that the far simplest explanation is that there is not a god, or at least not an interpersonal deity that’s portrayed in most religions. I went strictly militant atheist for a while, but now I’ve kind of settled on apathetic agnosticism. I don’t believe there is a god, I don’t believe there isn’t a god. I’m open to evidence, but I’ve thoroughly worn out my desire to keep seeking that evidence. As a former heroin addict, I lived through hell on earth and have exactly zero personal experiences that make me believe that a deity is more likely than not. Until I experience something that makes me think otherwise, I really don’t know, and I don’t care because I’ll still try to be the best version of me that I can with or without a god. And if that doesn’t mean something to any deity that is out there, I’m not sure I’m interested in worshipping that deity anyways.

Edit: what I mean by don’t care is that whether or not there is a deity doesn’t change how I plan to live my life unless he personally comes down and tells me what to do.

kratom,flt8rh5,t1_flt2kcl,1585463054.0,"I posted this reply to another comment here that had the same concerns you do and I’m copying it here:

The top comment on this thread addresses your concern pretty well. To put it simply, something like caffeine isn’t considered to be physiologically dependent even though there are physical withdrawal symptoms involved with ceasing use, mainly because there’s no risk of harm from stopping or restating use after cessation. No physiological dependence doesn’t mean “there will be no physical withdrawal symptoms whatsoever.” If you ingest anything in large amounts every day and quit abruptly, you will experience physical withdrawal symptoms but that doesn’t mean the substance causes physiological dependence. It just means your body has to adjust to the lack of the substance. Sugar is the first one that comes to mind for me. Substances that are physiologically dependent like heroin, benzodiazepines, and alcohol run the risk of permanent damage or death upon abrupt cessation of use. Kratom does not have this risk. Some mild physical discomfort doesn’t mean that there is physiological dependence. Dependence? Yes. But it seems to me it’s primarily psychological with some physical symptoms.

Another example would be something like methamphetamine. Meth is not considered to be a physiologically dependent drug, but if you cease use, you will definitely experience some physical discomfort. I’m not comparing kratom to meth, I’m just giving an example of how a substance can not create physical dependence while still having physical withdrawal symptoms."
kratom,flt8prq,t1_flstk1z,1585463006.0,"I’m assuming you had a bad experience with kratom abuse. This does happen. But saying kratom isn’t physiologically dependent doesn’t mean that abruptly ceasing excessive kratom use can’t be extremely uncomfortable. Methamphetamine is not considered to be a physiologically dependent drug. But stopping meth after a while of heavy abuse is absolute hell. I think people are misinterpreting “‘not physiologically dependent “ as “there are no physical withdrawal symptoms” and that’s not what it means. Substances that are physiologically dependent like heroin, benzodiazepines, and alcohol carry with them HUGE risks with ceasing use, including death (and yes, heroin withdrawals can kill—the excessive sweating, diarrhea, and vomiting can cause extreme dehydration and death). There are also physiological risks involved with resuming use of these substances following cessation. These risks are not found with kratom use."

I’ll agree that “lodge your taxes” does sound weird here in the US. But, grammatically, it’s not incorrect. There’s nothing “wrong” with that statement, it’s just not in colloquial/everyday use here.

I’m not trying to be an asshole, I just knew off the top of my head that lodge can indeed be a verb (lodge a complaint came to mind) and wanted to verify that I was right. Since I was, I figured I’d take a minute to try to share that information with you."

I brought it back in, spoke to a manager (I actually work at the same store but in a different town so she knew me) and we had a good laugh while the teenage cashier freaked out and apologized to both of us. Probably saved her job TBH. It would have been the second time that week she had come up short on a till by a fairly large amount. When I went in there for a while they had moved her to courtesy clerk, but I saw her cashiering again just the other day. I bet she’s more careful counting her money now."

I have to disagree with you there. We don’t all have the option of working from home. Not everyone’s work is closed. I work at a grocery store, and come into contact with 100s of people every single day. 

You DONT want all the grocery store workers just suddenly refusing to work, trust me.

I have friends who are nurses who are at extremely high risk for contracting this virus. 

You DONT want all the nurses suddenly refusing to work either.

I was called a frontliner the other day by a customer, and while I disagree and think that should be reserved for healthcare professionals, we ARE risking infection every day. Is that something we’ve “done to ourselves?”

If I get sick it won’t be my fault. I wash my hands every time I touch something outside my work area (behind a counter where customers aren’t allowed). I sanitize everything regularly. If I get sick it’s because some asshole thought “oh it’s just the flu, I’ll be fine” and went to go pick some nonessential bullshit up at the grocery store I work at and coughed all over everything."
