EatCheapAndHealthy,fqt67lj,t3_gklaj8,1589631223.0,"Yes.  Unfortunately I have.  Whatâ€™s more, a Thai place where we routinely get takeout seems to be under performing too. Maybe they donâ€™t have all the ingredients they need I dont know. Their usually awesome take out pad Thai has not been as good as it usually is"
BipolarSOs,fqt4a8k,t1_fqt2m2b,1589629492.0,"Thatâ€™s just terrible.  As someone with bipolar 1, I have to say the illness is NO excuse for that behavior.  Weâ€™re not all shitheads like that.  Sorry."

bipolar,fpqopr4,t3_gev789,1588827961.0,Nah I donâ€™t wish for mania.  Makes me act a damn fool which gives me more social anxiety long term
bipolar,fpqok6z,t3_gexypo,1588827845.0,I try and remember past bad stuff that has happened to me because of my irritability so Iâ€™ll be more patient.
bipolar,fpqoewi,t3_gemaf0,1588827735.0,Congrats!
bipolar,fpqocza,t3_gemg1g,1588827695.0,"Not while manic and Iâ€™m sure this is a whole other discussion.  When depressed I listen to maudlin tunes with love lost messages. While manic Iâ€™m too hyped up for music, choosing instead the deafening soundtrack of my obsessive thinking on DIY projects and cleaning."
bipolar,fpnlzw4,t3_gedvzx,1588767043.0,Congrats!
bipolar,fpid77p,t1_fpgl5qr,1588638498.0,I feel that.  Yes definitely.
bipolar,fpid52y,t1_fphkfns,1588638462.0,"Thatâ€™s the conclusion I came to as well, that they werenâ€™t true friends.  Also they were young and didnâ€™t understand what I was going through.  Hell neither did I. Iâ€™ve made dear friends since that time and I cherish them."
bipolar,fpg9w7q,t3_gd59l1,1588598099.0,Oh my lord yes.  I have had psychotic manias and I still havenâ€™t told any therapist or doctor or most friends and family the humiliating things Iâ€™ve done.  I lost all my college friends thank to my first mania that included bizarre delusions of grandeur that alienated everyone. Itâ€™s soooo damaging to relationships and personal dignity.
unpopularopinion,forbzd2,t3_g8oplm,1588009652.0,Amen.  Beautiful point. Thank you

bipolar,f7e7hi9,t3_dvhpmj,1573649454.0,Just beautiful. Really beautiful
bipolar,f6xi3zz,t3_dt5w84,1573250025.0,Oh yes.  Very much so. Was just thinking today that I have ZERO friends from all of my college days and thatâ€™s due to the awful manic irritability that led me to piss off everyone in my path.  Very cringe worthy stuff.
bipolar,f6xh2cn,t3_dt9weg,1573249423.0,I like all of them!!!!
MadeMeSmile,ez4eq70,t3_cztf3y,1567685702.0,Congratulations.  Thatâ€™s all wonderful. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever seen a more joyful expression on a human face ever ðŸ˜ƒ
