Anxiety,fcxwilj,t1_fcxvn1u,1578071469.0,"Me too! Going on about 9 years since my first panic attack. Trust me it will go away. This too shall pass is what I always tell myself. If you keep doing the right things you will wake up one day soon and realize that you aren’t anxious. Make sure you write down how you feel in the morning, keep a journal. This allows you to track your progress in recovery. I guarantee one day you’ll wake up and not want to write anything down, BECAUSE YOU FEEL SO MUCH BETTER!!! Always here to talk if you want to message"
Anxiety,fcxvdt6,t3_ejhxc6,1578071026.0,"I’m the same exact way. Usually it passes for me over time. I think things that help is meditation when those feelings come on and not dwelling on the feelings in your bed. If you feel uncomfortable in bed, get up and take a walk or start your day earlier, eventually every morning will become easier as a result. Also please go see a therapist. Verbalizing your concerns out loud is very helpful for me!"
Anxiety,fcwm9rm,t3_ej5av7,1578029621.0,"Interesting. However, if it’s your dream, how could I feel the same exact way as you? How do I know that your not just a figment in my dream? Sorry not meaning to be scary lol. Another note is that try and take notice when you find yourself stressing over little things during the day. You should feel that when u stress about real life, the dream starts to fade. Like I’ll go a couple hours without noticing it and remind myself to feel like shit again haha"
Anxiety,fcvwrvn,t3_ej5av7,1578011863.0,"I have a very similar situation. What you’re describing is called derealization/depersonalization. I have suffered from it for 10 years. It’s a symptom of anxiety. The weird thing is the derealization has really shaped the person I am today. After a while of suffering, I realized that if I was in a dream, I wasn’t going to ever wake up, so I might as well deal with it. As soon as I realized that, the feeling started to diminish. Obviously therapy and meds do help. Talking to someone helps a lot. It feels uncomfortable at first because everything seems so distorted, but the more you distract yourself from the feeling, the easier it gets. It also helps to engage in activities that are thrilling. I really like doing stand up comedy. It’s hard to feel the derealization while you’re standing in front of people trying to make them laugh. Kinda reminds you that you’re human. Working out has really helped me too. I know how uncomfortable this feeling is! I hope this helps a little"
Anxiety,fcvl6c8,t3_ej3d8n,1578004460.0,Setraline 50mg for me for 5 years! Works pretty well with a few hiccups here and there
Anxiety,fctfe77,t3_eitn04,1577941508.0,"I’ve worked in a restaurant for a few years! First off, everyone drops stuff! It just happens unfortunately. I once dropped 25 champagne glasses from my shoulder in front of a full restaurant! Another time I spilled champagne on an old lady’s head! It happens. As far as the customers, whenever I feel nervous or anxious, I just try to think of when I eat at restaurants. I start to realize that I never really pay attention to the server or care if they make little mistakes. Once you realize that the people just want to eat, it becomes a lot easier! I used to have to write everything down because I was so scared that I would forget and now I can take orders just by memory! It just takes time and practice, mistakes will happen just know that no one really cares as much as we think they do"
Anxiety,fcouqhv,t3_eedfz2,1577842097.0,"I’m currently going through this same thing. It’s weird, the last spell I had lasted until I blew out my knee playing basketball.

Anxiety,fcoubon,t1_fb6neff,1577841770.0,I think it is helping in the long run. The dp/dr is honestly probably a result of getting sober. I too suffer from dp/dr and the only times I get it now is when I try to quit nicotine

Anxiety,fci2c3v,t3_eh9y6p,1577656907.0,"Yes! If I’m not in a bout of anxiety I sleep and function like a normal human being (for the most part). If I feel normal I still have the anxiety but it doesn’t really bother me as much as the dark times. Doesn’t bother me at all really. I’ve noticed throughout the years that if you just get up and do the things that your mind tells you not to do, you will slowly start to get back to yourself. You and I have to proactive instead of reactive. I’ve waited for it to get better by doing nothing and it takes MUCH longer than if I just struggle through my normal routine"
Anxiety,fchjx2v,t3_ehavv2,1577651187.0,"Literally all the things you mentioned help. Plus if you’re into exercise it def helps. Once you get these things going in your life, it’s about staying the course and living one day at a time!"

Anxiety,fcce4ia,t3_eh1tjo,1577597355.0,"I just want to say that I have an extremely similar story to yours. When I was 15 I was sitting at my desk on the phone and I had the exact same thing. The way you question how a panic could happen just sitting at your desk has a simple answer. Anxiety does not discriminate! Time, place, person. It was very confusing for me the first time as well. I will tell you that it is highly unlikely that there is anything physically wrong with you. You are going through a very stressful period in your life. You may not realize it but the stressors of college can creep up on you all at once. Do any of your parents have a history of anxiety? My mom has it very similar to me. I take Zoloft 50mg and I have for several years. It doesn’t cure the anxiety, that’s up to you. However, it makes the panic attacks few and far between and the daily anxiety much more manageable. I can’t remember what your last question was hahah I’ll comment under this. Oh ya similar symptoms. In my experience, the symptoms you described are indicative of a panic attack. Certain medications don’t work for everyone and it’s really about trial and error. Don’t get discouraged about going back to college. The rhythm and routine that you are used to will help you feel better. Try talking to a therapist about what’s going on, that really helped for me. Hope this helps"

However, I can’t confidently say that I went almost a year without any significant or overwhelming anxiety. This is coming from someone who has been dealing with it for 9 years. Each year getting better than the last. When I fall into these spells, I tend to forget how good I felt before. You just have to remind yourself that your brain is a very powerful thing. Just because it tells you that you probably will feel bad forever, just know it CERTAINLY isn’t true. Trust me:)"

Anxiety,fc6y7cp,t3_egixmr,1577492555.0,"Hey man idk if you take medication already but that might be something to check out. Also verbalizing your thoughts really helps with a therapist or a close friend/family member. Not just texting but actually speaking your feelings seems to help me a lot. I’ve gone through the exact same thing you’re talking about as far as feeling like a completely different person. Exercise, meditation, really help. I’ve noticed that when I’m having a panic attack just taking deep breathes usually gets my heart rate down. As a more broad plan of action, just continuing to do the normal daily things that you usually do when you’re not anxious, will get you feeling better almost immediately. Don’t let the anxiety consume you. If someone invites you out, but you’d rather stay home because you’re anxious, go anyways. Go on that date. Do all the things you normally do (healthy things obviously) and you should start to feel a lot better"
Anxiety,fc6so40,t3_eggcd6,1577488479.0,"Ya I see what you’re saying. When the anxiety is making it hard to focus at work, the medication should make it easier by suppressing the racing thoughts and worry from anxiety. If anything it should be easier to work!

Anxiety,fc6quoe,t3_eggcd6,1577487162.0,"It’s a toss up. On one hand I don’t want to be dependent on a drug to make me feel good, on the other hand this anxiety for me is biological to some degree. It runs in my family and I genuinely believe I have some chemical imbalance in my brain. Say you had diabetes for example. Would you just not taking the medication? I think society is growing a lot in terms of stigma and allowing people taking medications to feel okay about it. If I’m feeling good, then life is good :)"
Anxiety,fc6m2t8,t3_eggcd6,1577483790.0,"Hey man. I’ve been on the same exact setraline 50mg for years now and I can confidently say that minus a total of maybe 3 months in the past 5 years, my anxiety and health anxiety have been under control and manageable. I wouldn’t say cured because obviously there’s flare ups and it doesn’t just magically go away with drugs. However, a combination of medication, therapy, and healthy living has allowed me to go close a year without having any abnormal and debilitating anxiety. Hope this helps. Give it a try!"

Anxiety,fc46n9g,t3_eg3nmw,1577408045.0,Seeing your normal doctor will be a good start and then they can refer you to a psychiatrist who prescribed the medication
Anxiety,fc3onk6,t3_eg0vw0,1577394777.0,"Sounds like you have health anxiety my friend. I’m by no means a doctor but I have 9 years of anxiety experience. Anxiety can present a lot of physical symptoms. I’m the type of person that likes to google all my symptoms to find the problem. DO NOT DO THAT. It will only make it worse. The thing about these symptoms with anxiety is that it’s a downward spiral cycle. The numbness scares you and you being scared about it feeds the symptoms. Have you noticed that when your mind is busy on other things that the symptoms seem to go away or diminish? As someone with anxiety I experienced a lot of the same symptoms as you. For months I dealt with numbness in my legs, arms, face and hands. I felt like my balance was off as well as my vision. I was thoroughly convinced that I had a brain tumor or MS. Even though I knew that I had anxiety, I did not believe that it could just be my mind playing tricks on me. I have a similar story to you. College athlete, outgoing guy, love the spotlight. However, anxiety does not discriminate. For some anxiety manifests due to outside factors such as childhood trauma and other traumatic events. My life was really good on paper. It just hit me one day like a dump truck and that’s really scary. You seem to be relatively new to discovering and researching about anxiety. I implore you to ASK your doctor to be referred to a psychiatrist or psychotherapist to discuss what you’ve told us. I truly think if you open up with those professionals, it will make you feel like things are starting to make sense. As far as the physical symptoms go, when you can distract your mind , they seem to start to go away. Unless there is an actual physical problem, which in this case there doesn’t seem to be any. Doctors are very good at their jobs. Hoped this helped sorry for rambling a bit."

What you’re currently experiencing is what I call “hangxiety” like an anxiety hangover. Even though you aren’t still having an actual attack, your body is still on edge from the attack and you may feel little mini attacks come and go"
Anxiety,fc12eon,t3_efkxim,1577306311.0,"I have a very similar story to you buddy. When I was 15 I got a bad cold and my mom gave me Sudafed. I had a horrible reaction to it which gave me my first panic attack. The main symptom after the panic attack was derealization. I thought I was going to be that way forever. I thought I would never get out of that mind state. I also thought I was going insane or schizophrenic, but that’s just the anxiety talking and you have to keep telling yourself that. I slowly worked to feel like myself again, it took a very long time, however everyone is different. Since then I have had a few panic attacks and some of them have been from weed. The best way for me to do defeat my derealization was to distract my mind in things that forced me to be present. Whether it was basketball, working out, video games, anything where I wasn’t stuck in my head. It may seem hard at first and like its not working, but I promise you it gets better. You won’t feel like this forever and you just have to take care of your body"

Everything you listed is a “what if” not a certainty. Therefore, it would only be logical to consider the other side of that “what if”. What if everything goes great. What if you absolutely kill it in school and start an amazing career because of it. What if everything works out. I highly recommend finding a therapist and psychiatrist IF you have insurance.

Had one a week ago and feel like I’m back where I started. I totally get you. I want to avoid everything I want to cry and sleep all day and throw up. Trust me I know exactly how you feel. I think honestly through all the medication and therapy, the only thing that truly got me through it was doing the things that I was afraid of. On Wednesday I was so fucking close to calling off work for a panic attack. I was literally trembling in my bathroom. Sometimes I lose this battle but this time I told myself YOU HAVE TO FUCKING GO. and I did. It was so shitty. I somehow finessed my way into leaving early but I did it.

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been to the doctors for issues I thought were life threatening that turned out to be anxiety. The reason I know that is because when the anxiety went away, so did the physical issues. Once you can get your mind off the fact that there’s nothing physically wrong with you, you’ll be able to feel better. Trust me I’ve been in your situation a thousand times.

When I can’t eat solid foods, the shakes always help. Healthy food is so important for your recovery. As for the mental aspect, it’s okay that you were drinking. That was the past, now is the present. You are already on your way by choosing not to drink alcohol. Those places in your house remind you of bad times but that’s not you anymore.

Anxiety,fbr2sip,t3_ee55l0,1577038464.0,I feel you I literally almost didn’t go to work just now but I’m doing it because I know it’s good for me to get my mind off it
Anxiety,fbqp1kj,t3_ee55l0,1577033844.0,"I know so well. It feels like if you forgot something really important at home but you don’t have time to go back and get it. However, you’re literally just lying in bed hahah. I used to have it everyday for months in the early years. All I can say is that it DOES get better and easier, I promise you that"
Anxiety,fbqnwdm,t3_ee55l0,1577033550.0,Of course. Let me know if you ever want to chat. Currently in bed doing exactly what I told you not to do soooo hahah
Anxiety,fbqcxcw,t3_ee55l0,1577030431.0,"I’ve been dealing with anxiety for 9 years. 24m. For me mornings are always hardest in the thick of it. The second that I open my eyes, I feel fine but as soon as I realize that I’m awake I start getting the symptoms you listed. Like you said, I also get better as the day goes on. I take Zoloft 50mg. I’ve noticed that the best way to deal with it is to get up as soon as you feel it, and start your day. This may seem tough if you haven’t had enough sleep,  but it will allow your mind to move from the anxiety and panic quicker. Over time, it will become easier for you to wake up and in turn, able to fall back asleep in the morning"
Anxiety,fbnrm2p,t3_edlfvh,1577002204.0,I’ve literally been freaking out about this all week. I can’t handle it. I NEED WORLD PEACE PLEASE
Anxiety,fbnmthf,t3_edt8ik,1577000179.0,I feel like that too right now. I’m out of school now but for some reason coming home for the holidays makes me so incredibly anxious. I feel like my few days off will be ruined by anxiety. I am just going to try and be as positive as possible. If you don’t like your school don’t be afraid to transfer! I did it 3 times and was very happy the third!
Anxiety,fbnm98x,t1_fbmbktc,1576999942.0,I have literally the same story as you
Anxiety,fbnk4jt,t3_edzwil,1576999030.0,Hit me upp
Anxiety,fbnjrb4,t3_eds2wb,1576998866.0,Getting better each day. Had a horrible anxiety attack with what I call an “anxiety hangover” for the past couple days. Nights are always better for me. Mornings are hard. Staying positive
Anxiety,fbngzaf,t3_ee1bh9,1576997646.0,Trust me I know EXACTLY how you feel. I spent months and months just suffering from horrible heath anxiety thinking that I had HIV from unprotected sex. All the worrying is pointless and the only real way to end the worry is to get tested for HIV. It’s terrifying in that moment but once you get the results back you will be happy again
Anxiety,fbh7z76,t3_ed7mwy,1576867394.0,"I’m a comedian with anxiety. Great combination right? My greatest pleasures in life are being on the stage in front of everyone, but that comes at a price. I’ve noticed the thing that has helped me most is to realize that YOU ARENT THAT IMPORTANT. I know this sounds harsh, but people really don’t care that much. Take for example a zit on your face. It may feel like when you show up to work everyone is staring at your zit, but they aren’t. People have their own issues and problems that IMMENSELY outweigh whatever it is that you’re doing. Do you spend all day thinking about other people’s zits? The best way to be a successful performer is to just be yourself. If they don’t like you for that then they can GTFO"
Anxiety,fbh7ha7,t3_ed851s,1576867069.0,Your life matters. We care about you
Anxiety,fbh4szc,t1_fb6vzby,1576865308.0,Always here to talk Elliot!
Petioles,fbh26mq,t3_edcpie,1576863812.0,"The mind is extremely powerful, more than we know. Just as an example, I have been smoking daily for close to a year now. Not as long as you and not as often during the day, but similar in some regard. A panic attack when I wasn’t high about a month ago completely turned me off from it. I have literally no desire to smoke when I feel this anxious. Im not saying that you should force yourself to have panic attacks but maybe some distraction or a healthier replacement for smoking will help ease the tension. Maybe trying cbd instead. Idk you probably think this is useless but just trying to give an outside perspective on your situation"
