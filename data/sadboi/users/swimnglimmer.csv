BPD,fqi7sy0,t3_giltnk,1589391958.0,"I agree with you on some of this except I find blanketing the term abuse to describe common BPD symptoms somewhat generalized and simplified...the emotional experiences of BPD occur within a unique dynamic (relationship) so these behaviors play out differently for everyone. Yes, without a doubt there are people with BPD who are abusive, but there are also people with BPD who have less of these tendencies. Crying in itself isn't abusive - everyone is allowed to feel how they want to, even if it seems irrational to someone else. The issue is how the tears are potentially weaponized as a means of leveraging power within a conflict.  Personally, I've had issues with abusive partners gaslighting me into thinking I'm manipulating them with my tears when I'm just genuinely sad about feeling rejected, maybe even because of something they did to warrant tears. I'm also not sure if begging someone to stay with you to avoid abandonment is abusive...it's certainly unhealthy and demanding but again, it depends on the situation, context, and how the person with BPD is expressing those sentiments and how the recipient responds. 

I do think it's great to feel radical acceptance/responsibility for your emotions. Going through that process in my own therapy was an extremely empowering and liberating feeling...also a painful one because it meant I had sit with my feelings and accept the choices of others. But as time as went on, I've also realized the complicated dynamics of some of the relationships I've been in and how ""it takes two"" is so extremely relevant when discussing the symptoms of BPD since its externalized through relationships."

Guess I'll just have to be super persistent cus I tried uploading my document but again, having the same problems, and it takes me to a weird IBM portal when I use the 'upload documents' from the cuny student first site. I've always had bureaucratic problems with CUNY but damn, this is frustrating..."
nycCoronavirus,fp6a70v,t1_fp68dlx,1588348829.0,"The problem with their ""sovereign territory"" is that it's in the middle of NYC. Whether they want to acknowledge that or not, it's the reality, and they need to be respectful of the other community they're apart of: Brooklyn.  Not only are they reliant on the city just like everyone else, but they also take up positions like landlords and make money off new yorkers. Now they want to selfishly jeopardize the safety of others because of their religious customs? Give me a break..."
CUNY,fp44zr9,t3_gb73nv,1588291800.0,"It's probably unlikely that they would add more sections but if you show up the first day of class most professors will add you, especially because a lot of students drop classes or don't show up. You could also email the professor before the semester starts and let him or her know your situation. Sometimes that helps!"

college,fnwu41d,t3_g4ds89,1587325478.0,"Yes, I'm taking a stats class on Aleks and it's hell right now. At first everything was pushed back but now we have the same amount of work, it's just been squeezed into a smaller time frame with added data projects on SPSS. Right now, I have 3 days to get approx. 35-40 hours of work done on top of my other 3 classes. It's extremely stressful.  I think it's the professors but it's also this outsourced web-based program they've contracted. ALEKS isn't meant to accommodate actual human/life circumstances. Luckily my teacher did push back a data project (not on Aleks) because I emailed him enough but it's still overload. I would recommend contacting other students so maybe you can all reach out at one time if they're experiencing something similar? Sometimes enough people complain, they'll change it.  You can also ask your teacher to release a class average... maybe they'll curve it?"

BPD,fn7uiw7,t3_g01itm,1586727910.0,"this is a really hard one to process. it's difficult to feel secure in a relationship when the boundaries and proof of love aren't being tested. personally, i always jumped to the conclusion that we would break up becus on a very deep level i felt everything was destined to end anyway. you have to learn to feel safe when an interpersonal conflicted arises.   

most importantly, you should probably remove yourself from him when you feel like you're getting to the point of ""breaking up"" with him. clearly you don't want to break up with him and these are empty threats concealing a bigger problem. take physical space to gain perspective and ask yourself what you are really trying to do and if you really want to hurt that person. obviously you don't want to break up with him so there's something else you're trying to communicate with these threats. And it takes two: your own self-acceptance and your partner's willingness to meet you where you're at emotionally."

It's really hard to concentrate on anything when you feel mixed emotions about the task at hand. For me, if I don't 100% love or obsess over something, I quit lol. I've gotten a lot better but I would say tolerating the boredom and uncomfortable nerves is 100% key to actually committing to something. Good luck!"
