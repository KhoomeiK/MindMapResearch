unpopularopinion,fqqjm58,t3_gk598o,1589566665.0,"Fake nails aren't expensive if you do them yourself. 500 piece nail sets are 7$ on amazon, 1$ nail polish works great because any nail polish you put on those fake nails is not going to come off, and a 3$ nail glue (if you choose the right brand and properly prep your nails, they last up to 2-3 weeks). I always have red stiletto nails that are maybe half an inch long, and they've never really gotten in the way of things I want to do or were a financial burden to me. I bought all of the things I listed and it was about 12$ for well over a year and a half of super cute nails.

Unless you're talking about 2-3 inch long nails, there is literally no problem with wiping your ass or hygiene. People with short nails can have horrible hygiene, and people with long nails can have amazing hygiene. I don't know why that's the breaker on whether you're clean or not??  Ultimately, if you don't like them, don't get them. Women don't do it for you, or honestly care what you think about them if it makes them happy. This doesn't sound like an unpopular opinion, it just sounds like you don't like long nails and don't really know what you're talking about."

I hate when people, mainly christians, try to get me back into following God. 

My main retort to these kinds of people is, ""How has your religion made you a better person?"" Most of the time that gives them some food for thought and quiets the remarks. In my opinion, their religion hasn't made them a very understanding, or open minded person if they're trying to force you to believe what they do."

Also in my opinion, I don't think you should get intimate until she's 100% comfortable with telling you all of her symptoms and isn't super embarrassed about it. If I hadn't of been open about it and comfortable with my boyfriend I probably wouldn't have enjoyed the first 5 times we had sex at all. Also might be off topic, but during foreplay ask her if she has to pee, because if you ask and she goes to pee you can both enjoy it and she won't be thinking ""Shit I have to pee but I don't want to ruin the moment""  Stress that you're not grossed out, it doesn't ruin the mood, and that you'd prefer for her to communicate with you. I know this goes for every relationship, but with endo it's massively important.

Also, if she doesn't have one already, a heating pad is the perfect christmas/birthday/hell even anniversary gift lol

edit: forgot to mention she might be nervous about sex, even if she's comfortable with you, she might be scared that it'll hurt, give her 5 times the amount of foreplay and reassurance you think she needs.

MelanieMartinez,fbyftij,t1_fbyf9ic,1577215825.0,"Exactly! I ran a Melanie fan page from 2016-2017 and over that time I had posted SO many concert videos, and for example, ignoring the outfits/hair/makeup/dancing being different, there were concerts where her wig would almost fly off lol, she’d sing right up next to the security guard, show intense emotion, have different props and just do so many different things and I feel like that was really keeping the fans interested during the end of the crybaby tour because there was still new stuff you know?"
MelanieMartinez,fbyevcj,t1_fbxuenb,1577215144.0,"I agree. I live in NC and would’ve probably went to the tour if it wasn’t the same stuff over and over again :/ in my opinion the crybaby tour and any performances before k12 seemed so genuine and special because Melanie would do different things at different concerts, but now I have no interest in seeing her tour. :/"
MelanieMartinez,fbyek2t,t3_eexydp,1577214920.0,"I agree. The replay value is just disappointing compared to crybaby. I hate to say this because Melanie worked so hard and for so long on the album, but it’s really incomplete without the movie and I feel like that’s the biggest problem, the second is that it’s just a little too political/storytelling in my opinion, personally I don’t relate to any of the songs, none of the lyrics really stood out like in crybaby, I can see how some songs would be good for middle schoolers to listen to because it’s talks about things that I needed to hear when I was that age but above all it just feels so surface level and reliant on the visuals. I love the movie, but I don’t listen to the album without watching the film or music videos. Some lyrics are relatable, but for example wheels on the bus, class fight, nurses office, the songs are fully based on the movie and it almost ruins the enjoyment when you’re listening to it and not watching the film."

Good luck I hope you find them"
MelanieMartinez,fbtc695,t1_fbt77c7,1577074196.0,"omg please pm me the link when you post it!! If you have Instagram I’ll be glad to send you screenshots of pages from Brian weiss’s books that are referenced if you need them!! I have many lives many masters and messages from the masters :) I’m so happy someone is making that, I wanted to make a video like that but I as you can probably tell I’m not very good at explaining things like this because it’s SUCH an in depth topic that’s hard for someone who doesn’t have background knowledge to understand you know?"
MelanieMartinez,fbt6d0h,t1_fbt633a,1577069499.0,Yes! It saddens me that not many people really follow these beliefs in their own lives so it’s not obvious to them (which is fair because it’s not as well known) I hope it gets to more people because it can improve the lives of fans too. I’m so happy Melanie incorporated these things into k12 because it’s such a powerful message in general
MelanieMartinez,fbskwqc,t1_fbrkll1,1577056639.0,"Please check out my comment about it, most of this theory is debunked by my comment as it's heavily influenced by melanie's beliefs and I don't see anyone talking about it ://"
MelanieMartinez,fbskoi4,t3_ee7rwt,1577056550.0,"I don't want to spoil the magic here man but, it's not a magic door, and she wouldn't be going back to her real life. K-12 is heavily influenced by melanie's spiritual/religious beliefs. She posted a pic from Dr Brian Weiss' book ""messages from the masters: tapping into the power of love"" in 2017/18, and has continued posting things related to it. I follow these beliefs (not as heavily as Melanie does though) and it's sort of complicated to explain, but I'll try to make it simple because it's sad that no one else seems to get the references.

The door, in my opinion, represents the plane/level of consciousness you reach when you 'die' (exit this current life) you 'die' when your soul has nothing more to give or receive from the current life. 

Lilith 100% represents a master, as some of the things she says are identical to what is said in Dr Brian Weiss' books. A master is a soul who has been through many lives, and has essentially the 'perfect' soul, masters are guides for other souls on their journeys. ""we must feel pain through experience"" is directly taken from BW (Brian weiss') books. He explains that when we are in our true form, as a soul, we don't feel any pain or negative feelings. That's why we come to a life, to progress our soul. In the start of the movie crybaby explains her dream, of being told ""it's just temporary"" from someone named lilith, I think this is included because some people are able to remember past lives or have spiritual experiences while they dream, which is something also mentioned in BW books. 

After Orange juice, crybaby says something along the lines of ""we aren't our bodies, they're just temporary"" this is a reference to the quote ""Our bodies are just a vehicle for us while we're here"" from Messages from the masters.

There are more references to Brian weiss and his books but there's only so much I can really explain without it being overwhelming."
asaprocky,fbloqkv,t1_fbk9fwn,1576966394.0,That's what I was thinking. It looks the same as when people out on a fake pregnancy belly or a fat suit that bulges out from the rest of the skin.
electronic_cigarette,fbkj72l,t1_fbgzx3o,1576951214.0,Ohh okay! Does it have to sit up ? I talked to her bf and he said her current vape should stand straight up and he’s scared because if she sits on it accidentally and the button is pressed it could explode ?? I really don’t understand it much. Also idk who commented rude stuff about your nails but your nails are so cute!! I have the exact same ones only they’re red! Stilettos are the cutest
depression,fbi6l8l,t3_ecmloz,1576892248.0,"I'm sorry about your finances man. DIY Christmas gifts are normally easy and cheap to make, if you like the idea, make origami for your loved ones, Michaels has origami paper for like 5$ but if I remember correctly they pretty much ALWAYS have a 40/50% off coupon if you download the app. I think paper that's a little smaller is cheaper too. I hope things get better for all of us soon."

productivity,fbeqhoc,t3_ecvbvc,1576791581.0,"I have a few that motivated me for MONTHS, they might not resonate with you as much unless you deal with the same things, so I put other things to do that might motivate you :) 

1. The threat of cockroaches and bed bugs, I lived with them and just that helped me repair the 20 years of neglect my hoarder mom put on the house. She dealt with mental problems and my dad was an alcoholic so there was no cleaning being done. If you have ocd/paranoia, I don’t recommend this because it might motivate you for the wrong reasons.

2. Read the benefits of decluttering/living in a clean environment and write them all down and decorate it with cute doodles or something so it’s seen as a positive thing! 

3. Watch the Marie kondo show (if you don’t have Netflix, a simple search of the show name with “123” after it will bring it up for free, if you swing that way lol) 

4. If you follow a religion, have a certain belief in spirituality, or are interested in it in any way, use that as motivation, my beliefs are based on Dr Brian Weiss’ books and with that I did a little research on material objects and such. Even if you don’t believe in any of that stuff, please don’t hesitate to reply to this for certain quotes that really got me into gear! The book I read regularly is called messages from the masters, and it’s amazing :) 

5. Turn it into a game, I know it’s the most generic advice for starting something but the method that helps me out most is saying “okay I’ll declutter/put back 25 things” it seems like a big number to start with, but once you actually try finding an exact number of things, more and more things seem to pop up and you can quickly exceed that number :) 

Good luck!!"
EggsInc,fbawp2j,t1_fbawesn,1576688393.0,"But pre farming and chicken box farming isn’t a thing everyone who plays the game knows how to do, like it’s not something the dev put in there and explained like he does with soul eggs or prophecy eggs. I guess I just don’t like the idea of having to do that stuff, it just feels odd to me. Either way debating on here isn’t productive for either of us, let’s agree to disagree and just appreciate that we have a cute chicken farm game lol"
EggsInc,fbavwda,t1_fbavola,1576687906.0,IMO I shouldn’t have to glitch or cheat or do anything other than doing the contract normally just to be able to have a chance to get the first reward with a 2Q EB and all epic research finished. That just shows there’s a problem with contracts.
EggsInc,fbau8qc,t1_fbatxcz,1576686896.0,"Bro I’m pressed about the tokens because I WANT to carry people. I just got my EB up to 500q right before the update. Now it’s at almost 2Q and I can’t carry at all. Assuming gets a conversation nowhere. 
A few weeks ago I carried a contract delivering 5q eggs and now I can’t even get to 1q, this isn’t easier. The updates are obviously made to make the game harder without spending money."
EggsInc,fbat296,t1_fb9alee,1576686156.0,"They are related though, because if the game didn't get harder in general it would not be a problem. Context matters, the reasons I listed have a huge effect on contracts and that's why adding tokens to make contracts even harder is so annoying. I do like playing the game though, thanks."
EggsInc,fb990fd,t1_fb98gdc,1576632473.0,"Yes, I am. If it was the ONLY thing that changed with the update, then no, I would not. But think about it:

1. The piggy bank was capped (few months ago) and the prices were raised 
2. Boost prices raised (some are doubled) 
3. Research prices raised 50%
4. More farm value needed to get to the next egg 
5. Now contracts are harder 

This isn’t obvious greed to you? Think about it, with people cracking the piggy, buying pro permits, watching ads for bocks/golden eggs, ad for 2x for x hours, and the few people who buy golden eggs. 
There are so many things to add to this game, like different hen houses, vehicles, eggs, etc. but ALL of the new updates ONLY add things to make going through the game more difficult, the goal is to get people to spend more money and it’s painfully obvious. 
And with 110,000+ reviews on the App Store + the dev saying more people than ever are playing it (his response to the piggy bank cap) he is definitely making good money."

EggsInc,fb8mymb,t3_ebt5th,1576617394.0,"Dude exactly. Literally just broke my piggy bank and had 2.5 million golden eggs after finishing all epic research. I used a lot of boosts to get my EB to 450q% and was so excited to help carry people and then was forced to update to even do contracts. This is greedy and ridiculous. Ruins contracts. Especially with the research prices going up 50% too. And with a 1Q goal, this is a slap to our faces lol"
rant,fb8lg5n,t3_ebpwo8,1576616464.0,"This. I use the box method because it's easier for me, but at the same time it's definitely not as accurate, it's really easy to mess up and sometimes it just gives the wrong answer. Either way, a kid should be able to do the work in the way that works BEST FOR THEM, and getting into trouble for not doing it the teacher/schools way is ridiculous. I had a teacher in 10th grade who would knock off points on our notebooks because they weren't the way SHE wanted them to be. Teachers/schools/rules like this make school and learning so much harder for kids."

depression,fb58mfv,t3_ebeok0,1576523029.0,"Please don't trust these ""it'll be back"" comments 100%. It might come back, and it might not. 

In 10th grade I had been crippled with anxiety for years, but it got so severe I missed two months of school. I woke up one morning and it was gone, literally gone. It went from a 9 out of 10 to a 1, I went back to school and had no problems with it at all. That was 2-3 years ago, and it hasn't been back since. My therapist told me it could be a subconscious thing, but obviously couldn't give a real explanation for it. I had struggled with anxiety since 6th grade, then one day it was gone. Have hope my friend, good luck!"

This is what tanked google plus, forcing consumers to use a thing that 95% of them dislike, and instead of just listening to them and complying. This game is going downhill fast and it's disappointing. Dev said last time that there's more players, what about now? I've seen like 10 people just yesterday on this sub say they've deleted/are deleting the game.

Oh and I think he's botting good reviews again. they're all ""good game"" ""fun"" or, my favorite ""sejfhnskdjfhfh"""
