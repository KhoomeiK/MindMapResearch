Supernatural,fas3o2h,t1_faottpi,1576323177.0,"I think that's just a way to shut people up for having a different, but valid opinion on an important relationship on the show. I think it's perfectly fair to say it seems rushed, and forced. Considering how they've built other characters in the past. Plus if you scroll further down in the comments you'll see another example. A lovely fangirl calling out OP for being a ""jealous house wife"" and being the reason why Jo and Bella got killed off. Just because we don't like Sam and Eileen as a couple doesn't mean we hated everyone that was ever with the Winchesters. I think being jealous is about the only argument and rebuttal they have."
Supernatural,farsv82,t1_fann8dz,1576319813.0,"YES! THANK YOU. I keep seeing so much people gush over them being a romantic couple and i keep thinking to myself How?! I honestly 100% agree with you and I was looking for a post that says exactly this! It feels so awkward and out of place and almost dare I say a bit cringe at times. We are at the finale here, no need for rushed romances, this isn't what the show is about, nor has it ever been. Cue past failed relationships of everyone in the show."
Supernatural,farpmvo,t1_fare5rz,1576318723.0,I'm hoping Mark Sheppard comes back too :( Crowley was by far my most favorite demon.
Supernatural,farn2y8,t1_fan9xge,1576317863.0,"I have the same feeling about Cas too! I hope I'm wrong though, but then again the empty literally told him the moment he truly is happy that's when it will take him. Also interested to hear your take on the Sam and Eileen endgame? I'm not sure they would kill her off again, but I guess you never really know with supernatural. But I'm also not keen on seeing them end up together, seems very forced, and rushed, it feels a bit awkward as well at times. I liked them much better as friends and seeing her as a supporting role like Jodie or Donna."
