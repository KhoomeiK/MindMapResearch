Anxiety,fd12b9n,t3_ejqtj4,1578126807.0,"Same here. Anxiety is terrible and I am really getting fucking tired of it!!! 26 years old and I havent done shit with my life except drop out of college and have two kids. I get you. We can do it, even if it the hardest thing we have to do in our lives"
driving,fcww80n,t3_ej7wv3,1578040227.0,Do you live in a big city? If you do maybe try going to a DMV located in a smaller nearby town. They might not be as busy and maybe the driving instructors wont be so hard on you.
Anxiety,fcvq9pz,t3_eit1wh,1578007667.0,Yes. Unfortunately anxiety has ruined my marriage.
TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,fcvq77o,t3_eiyl02,1578007622.0,Unpopular opinion but I dont think shes pretty. Certainly not ugly but not that pretty either. She needs to tone down the dark eyeshadow. Also why is her hair always in her face like that. I would love to see her do a cute bun or something. It would be refreshing to see. Her hair always looks like a tangled greasy mess.
SuicideWatch,fcvppbv,t3_ej5q0o,1578007302.0,"I've been feeling like this too lately! As sad as it sounds I am so tired of life. Nothing in my life has ever gone right. I'm So tired of having crippling anxiety while also trying to be a full time parent. I wish I could give up, but we have to keep going."
SuicideWatch,fcvpkqd,t3_eis7xd,1578007220.0,Meh. I feel like that right now. I kinda want to go to sleep forever but not really die.. ya know ?
