Don't beat yourself up if you can't sign along to songs you'd usually listen to if it's fast - just try to have fun and eventually you'll be signing in no time! I used to be pretty slow myself (and mixed up a lot of words too), but I somehow became one of the fastest signers in my class. All it really takes is dedication, a good group of friends to sign with, and passion! 

Also, if your friends haven't recommended HandSpeak, I'd definitely look it up. They have a dictionary (which is a godsend for people like me who forget words easily)  and links to help you learn ASL. I don't usually use it for the links to learn ASL, but you should also practice reading fingerspelling. The first result for ""finger spelling"" is an awesome website I used to read and practice my alphabet too.

I've been having some of those thoughts recently too because, like I said, life just hasn't given me a break and it has gotten slightly worse in some areas lol 

For now, try to find little things to help relax in the meantime. I'd suggest watching a comedy special (The Machine is awesome if you haven't seen it. I promise you, you'll laugh your ass off), listening to music, or playing a video game to pass the time till you see your therapist. I don't know what you're really into, but I hope that helps.

Long story short, I went crazy for at least four months until I went cold turkey because I couldn’t take the pain I was experiencing or the overwhelming suicidal thoughts that came with the pill.

However, I now have an non-hormonal IUD with meds for my bipolar and ADD. So, I wouldn’t recommend against birth control like that crazy lady - it’s just finding the right one and understanding the impact and pain you might endure those first few months because the IUD hurt like a motherfucker (:"

bipolar2,fbrlu2r,t3_ee7bgb,1577044038.0,"There are more factors to being bipolar than just the ‘manic spending’ part of it. When I am given money, I do splurge a little, but typically I don’t like to when I have worked for it, even if I’m in a hypomanic state. That’s probably because I didn’t have much growing up and I try to save my money when I directly earn it. 

Rather, I have the other typical symptoms of rambling on too much and sharing every detail of my life because I seek out attention for some ungodly reason even when I have all the attention on me. I also can’t control how loud I get - time or place doesn’t usually matter. My thoughts are extremely fast and it feels like I have ADD (which I also probably have). I get really energized randomly, especially when I go out with people or do anything prior to me sleeping - even if it’s been 6-10 hours, it will hit me with an ungodly amount of energy. 

I still swing between hypomanic states and depressive ones (currently in depressive). Especially with those two modes I go between, when I’m in a mixed state/depressive episode, I am forgetful, extremely exhausted, my mind gets foggy, and I cannot function like a normal person. My memory becomes really terrible. Sometimes I even dissociation. It’s exhausting among other life responsibilities. 

My point is that there is so much more to being Bipolar than just the spending issue. There’s manic and depressive episodes (and mixed ones). Mixed episodes are just a fun whirlwind of manic-depression. Specifically during a hypomanic state, you could possibly have reckless behavior. Maybe you don’t. With reckless behavior, it can be anything like not getting enough sleep to doing various drugs all at once to cheating on your s/o. It’s not one specific thing regarding sexuality and money. It’s anything that can be reckless, but also self-destructive.

If you are still questioning your diagnosis, talk to your psychiatrist. I’m just another person with bipolar on the internet and I can only speculate so much. Hopefully you get the answer that helps you live to the fullest of your potential. 

Good luck!"

We were mutual about it, I just really miss the good night and good morning text even though I brought this upon myself. I just feel a wreck and making that rash decision last night (though it seemed to be coming) felt right. I just genuinely miss him"

ADHD,esu0fd0,t1_estgqhj,1562276064.0,"I’m only taking half of a 10mg tablet at the moment, so it’s 5mg until my sort of “ease into it” week is over! I definitely notice after 5 hours I’m getting more antsy and the sort of “do everything now at the same time” attitude is coming back. 

Typically, I cannot focus for more than 10 minutes so it was kind of nice taking my second pill today and being able to just watch two whole episodes of strangers things without getting distracted. Usually I can only watch 30 minute episodes before I don’t get distracted."

CleaningTips,espswpg,t1_espsfmc,1562189500.0,"Oh, of course! Sorry, I meant I didn't want to wash them inside of a washing machine as they're more prone to shrinking (and I have really long legs - so I'd like to avoid that as much as possible haha). 

&#x200B;

I have a little collapsable washing container I use to soak my jeans in and let them air dry in my bathroom, but as for the specific spot I wanted to see if there were any ways I could wash them without using my washing machine or even washing them whole - the last time I wore them was when I ate that chocolate or pb/j haha. They probably need a thorough wash now though... considering they've been in a pile of laundry lol"
