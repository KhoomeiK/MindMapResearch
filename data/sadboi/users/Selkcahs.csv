Take in special consideration to put the types of attack modules that adapt to you battle tactics.

In the early game nobody has tanks (and pirates are always infantry),  so this is pretty effective against them and Minors. I would not recommend starting a war with another faction until you at least have second class ships and best atk/def modules.

yorickmains,f6m3ze8,t3_drrna9,1572966266.0,"She has no way of escaping your Wall, so it's your main tool for engaging/escaping. Also if you are constantly getting hit with her E (the one that copies you champions) you are going to lose trades and die with any champion.

What i ussually do pre lvl 6 is this: farm while clearing her tentacles (never let her have more than 2) and save 4 graves on the ground. When she tries to hit you with E if she reachs you ran away, if you avoid it, you go all in. E, Ghouls, Walls, etc.

Post lvl 6 is the same but you have to start the fight ready for a disengage if she cast ther ultimate. Never fight Illiao under her R.

Remember that if you engage witouth dodging her E first you need a lot of advantage, because she is going to use it melee range (so you cant dodge it) and their damage and heal will be doubled. Also going with an early Executionrr's Call is recomendable.

Anyway, the best strategy with Illiao is not fighting her unless she is in a very bad spot. Only do an 1v1 when you are SURE you win. Its similar to Darius, it can be a hard nut to crack and if you fed them they are going to carry the game; so just abuse their lack of movement with 2vs1 ganks."
EndlessSpace,f6lfe2w,t3_driygm,1572941870.0,"Ok, update with new questions. I started a campaign in the middle of the galaxy, i conquered lot of worlds and i have a huge surplus of everything (FIDIS & strategic/luxury). I am currently at war with 4 factions in 4 different fronts, each front has a fleet of around 20 ships (1 for siege, 2/3 for defense and the rest for pure damage) with dedicated militar Heros and i am slowly but surely conquering each of them. 

Questions/doubts:

- Each colony has lot of buildings to research and the tech tree still has lot of things left, but because i don't feel like needing anything i just have high industry systems producing militar ships and all the others coverting industry to Dust, also my entire empire is at full happiness. What am i missing? What can i do with this extreme surplus of everything to speed up the steamroll against my enemies that i am missing? I also stopped micromanaging most things (like which population is good on which type of planet) due to their penalties/bonuses being largely irrelevant.

- Even i am having great succes with fleet combats (i choose a combat tactic and build fleets that have full sinergy with that strategy) i still havent figured out which weapons are better (shield & hulls are pretty straightforward), due to them doing similar effects and dps (also confusing ones that are not properly explained).

- I still haven't grasped siege completly, i am still using infantry to invade due to not knowing how to use tanks/planes (i got the tech researched but i don't know how to apply the bonus). Due to this i just siege for a few turns until i can invade with infantry (which is a very slow process).

- is there a time when you dont want to keep conquering planets? I mean not systems but planets of a system already in your power. Even if the planet is ""bad"" is still more of something, and later you can terramoph them to a better type.

- i have almost all systems overpopulated but i havent noticed any significant penalty, is there any reason bothering avoiding it? Same with ""overcolonization"", im above the limit but happiness is still high as always.

- can't figure out how to move trough space witouth star lanes and how to protect against my enemies atacking far away systems with that tactic (it seems pretty op and unnecessary imo). 

-last: i usually play 4X with the objective of creating an empire across a map with no particular ""victory"" condition, just having fun while subjugating all the others factions. Is there a way to desmactive non-militar victory conditions so i can play indefenetly a campaign withouth worrying that the AI will end the game with a Science/Economy/etc victory?"

Against high mobility you have to stay safe and always save the wall after they use their dashes. The main threats IMO are Renekton, Gnar and Camille, i always ban renekton and i play ultra safe against the other 2.

In the case of ranged squishy champs with mobility, you play safe until you can land a combo (E with Ghouls and Wall when they dash trying to escape) so you have enough burst damage to kill them.

Play very pasive and rely on your passive to regain health if you are damaged, even at the cost of farm loss. If he goes with ignite prepare to be bullied.

Try to only last hit minons on tower cover and if you are on the middle of the lane always use bushes.

If he misteps pre lvl 6 you kill him, first go E, when he wastes the Blind use Q and ignite. Post-6 same combo but with ultimate as finisher. Also, post 6 never chase him, go for the instand burst even flashing on his face.

You can also request help from the jungle, if you get 2-0 advantage the lane is over for him. Take in consideration he can go AD or AP, wait to see which way he goes before buying defensice items (always buy boots first here)."
GarenMains,f3ufqg2,t1_f3ts9rz,1571159373.0,"Sure. Here it is a general ""guide"" about my approach to the new changes and also general tips on Garen and Top lane:

**Runes:**  
\- I always pick Precision tree & Conqueror rune, its just too good that there is not even a debate for using others IMO. Thanks to it you have an incredible kill potential lvl 2 with Hit, Q, E, Hit & Ignite (maybe even flash to finish them off if they use their own, or just let them escape while losing lane priority). Next Triumph (no other rune can compete there), Alacrity (choose this over Tenacity because it help us Scale and we got a Tenacity buff for a brief period with our W, which is enough used properly) & Coup de Grace  (clearly the best rune for allowing us to finish opponents easier with our ultimate).

\- Secondly i use the Resolve tree for Demolish -because Garen was always a decent split pusher and now he is just an awesome one with all that Attack Speed items (this rune also allows you to finish quickly Tier 1 before min 14 and start roaming Mid Lane or just keep pushing to Tier 2 and destroying it in the first try)- & Second Wind for lane sustain (you need to stay healthy so you can combo & punish your opponents when they make a mistake or just survive hard matchups like ranged pokers). I really don't like Bone Plating, but it may be an option if you are good using it. I also like Unflinching & Overgrowth, but i strongly thinks that Demolish & Second Wind are better choices.

\- Accessory runes: i always go +9 adaptive force, +9 adaptive force and +8 magic resist unless the enemy team has no AP damage at all, then i change the magic resist for armor of course.  


**Summoner Spells:**  
Flash & Ignite: Flash needs no explanation. Why ignite over Teleport? because Teleport sucks on Garen and Ignite just shines, let me elaborate.

Teleport: is good when you can impact significantly after using it, like ganking Bot Lane in search of a double kill; Garen lacks this potential in most circumstances & using it only to return to lane it's not worth it. Of course that if you think you have a rough game ahead when you won't even consider killing your opponent without help from your Jungler and you just want to stay alive, farm and protect your tower; Teleport becomes a viable option (or maybe you just like it and you excel on making plays with it). What i mean is, i recommend Ignite but if you strongly like Teleport just go with it.

Ignite: the MVP, it gives you burst potential since lvl 2, it allows you to finish opponents when that cursed Ultimate lets them on 1% of HP, it allows you to kill champions without your R and it functions as Grievous Wound (even more on late game if for some reason you didn't buy Executioner's Calling). Some common arguments against it is that is bad on Late game, but if you are playing Garen you are planning on winning Mid game and maybe supporting your team on Late game; but thinking you can overcome by your own scaling champions when they are on full build its just irrational. Anyway, i cannot stress enough how important this summoner spell is for me.  


**Items:**  
Take in perspective that i play Garen as a semi-tank splitpusher with LOT of carry potential if ahead and fed.

\- First and foremost: Trinity Force as first item almost always, every ability triggers Spellblade, take that in consideration when sequencing your powers. If you are too far behind and you can't impact the game at all you will probably just go full tank, so you may take Black Cleaver for utility (lowering armor of enemy team so you ADC can melt them) and because it's cheaper and gives you more tanky stats. 

\- Boots: Ninja Tabi or Mercury's Treads depending on enemy team. In normal conditions go for Mercury's, the Tenacity is always good and with that magic resistance, the one from the runes and your W passive you don't need any additional MR item unless the enemy team AP champions are fed; but if you think that you are really gonna need the 12% reduction of basic attacks of Tabi, just go with that and buy MR later.

\- Second and Third item: in normal conditions i go first for Dead Man's Plate (mobility for roam & chase, tankiness % slow) and then Sterak's Gage (damage, hp, shield; its just awesome for engaging a team figth and surviving the initial burst). This may change if you have an AP damage dealer fed

\- If you need additional Magic Resistance just take the items that suits you: you are stomping? go for Wit's end and close the game. You are against fed Teemo and/or Malhazar? Adaptive Helm. Against almost any other AP foe? Spirit Visage.

\- If the enemy team has decent healing effects go for an early Executioner's Calling, this gives you a lot of team utility because your ability to apply grievous wound to multiple champions while spinning (if bought upgrade it as LAST ITEM to Mortal Reminder).

\- From here (6th or 5th & 6th item) you need to choose wisely depending on the state of the game (if you reach this point, this choice is fundamental and choosing poorly can cost you the game): against lot of critic? Randuin's Omen. Last push for the win? Guardian Angel. You need to survive a bit more but you already have enough MR & Armor resistance to survive Chernobyl? Warmog's Armor. You lack damage and maybe sustain while fighting? Death's Dance.

\- A consideration on carry builds: you will see people building (and winning) with full attack speed & critic (Berseker's Greaves, Phantom Dancer, Infinity Edge, etc). I would only take this to have fun on Normal games or when you are just so far ahead that you are like ""fuck it, lets tilt this guys"". Why? because it's so hard to engage, being a melee with low mobility you can die before you even start dealing damage; also, your team probably depends on you starting the Team Fight and taking the initial burst damage.  


**Some matchups & general tips:**  
I won't go on champion specifics because it would make this extremely long, but i would give some tips for Garen and Toplanes in general that i learned along the way.

\- You are better against everybody with the new changes: good matchups are just easier than ever, lot normal matchups are now (or at least better) and bad matchups are not that bad.

\- You need to identify since loading screen if your matchup is gonna be good or bad (ranged & better fighters are usually ""bad""). If you are in disadvantage just farm safely and wait for a window (them using their abilities on minions, bad positioning, jungler gank, etc). Against ranged you usually wait for a burst combo, if they are low health you can try it before 6; if not, just wait for it and show them the full might of Demacia there. Against better fighters, you need them to make a pretty bad mistake or just wait for your jungler to appear while safely farming close to your tower. Patience is key here, one bad move and you are dead and lost lane priority.

\- Never rely on your jungler, this is solo queue (unless you go duo of course). You need to thrive and survive alone, if the jungler plays along great; but if not, you need to be able to at least protect your tower.

\- Always take in consideration how strong the enemy jungler is, how well he is playing & and where on the map he is. If you pushed a little and he gank you 2vs1, you are so dead that you won't even notice. Of course that sometimes you just going to gamble it and this is gonna what happens: ""Fuck it, i REALLY want that second plate"" \*proceeds to get raped by an smurf Hecarim\*.

\- ALWAYS, i mean ALWAYS buy pink wards. As i stated before, you alone are in charge of your survivability. Vision is essential because you have few escape means, always put the pink on the back bush (unless you are stomping and your opponent has no chance at all of reaching the river).

\- Your biggest weakness as Garen is being kitted, so try the champions that kit you unless there is an easy kill.

\- Try not to chase champions with mobility unless that kill can allow you to tip the balance of the game (like killing that fed Jungler that will allow you to kill Baron).

\- I usually focus on Q first, doing hit & run with it when you can't fully commit to a fight is great and it just decimates the towers. If the enemy Toplaner has an ability that can mess up with your Q (Fiora, Teemo, Jax, etc) focus on E.

\- Mute the All chat from settings. I also recommend muting team chat and just communicating trough Pings.

\- Don't tilt (easier said than done). If you are doing horrendous because you are being camped or it's just a bad day: stop the bleeding, play ultra safe (even sacrificing farm) to give your team a chance to help you and get back in the game. Take in special consideration that lot of Top lanes can win the game by themselves if fed.

\- And last but not least: have fun playing, this is after all a game."

GarenMains,f3u3j4u,t1_f3tq2wj,1571152159.0,"Always Darius. If someone already banned it, then Fiora. 

Basically i tried to ban the lane bullies that win trades. Other good bans may be Urgot, Yorick, Vayne, Quinn, Teemo; but they are not played that frequently (Vayne is ussualy ADC unless they are specifically countering you)."
GarenMains,f3l4iuh,t3_dh55sd,1570972429.0,"Conqueror allows you to bully the lane like a Darius. Lvl 2 you con Q, E and kill almost anyone with Ignite.

Conqueror its just an OP rune, if you want to experiment other runes like shield bash or something like that use it on secondary place. I use the rune to destroy towers (because you can never destroy a torret too fast) and the one that gains life or that heals you when they poke you (depending on match up)."
GarenMains,f3byae0,t1_f3bt2ku,1570817561.0,"Im also a Garen Main. But the E triggering conqueror its too much for me, of course that if they nerf that they should buff something else (more damage, spins, scaling, etc). 

Garen nowadays is more competitive, but its still kiteable and predictable. Good for ladder in certain matchups & bad on everything else.

Also, you could say that maybe its not a problem of how good Garen is, but how fucking good the Conqueror Rune is."
GarenMains,f3b5n0p,t3_dg5but,1570802283.0,"My build is Trinity, Boots, Dead Mans Plate & Sterak. I find that this is almost always the best path, no matter what you are against (Maybe replacing Youmuu for DMP if you are just so dar ahead and need to close quicily the game).

Then it depends on the game situation: need to chase? Youmuu, need to carry but also start the fight and absorb damage? Deaths Dance, against a lot of Critic dmg? Randuin, too much Ap? Visage/Helm, need to stop healings? Mortal Reminder, the game its almost over and you need to do that last push against 5 entrenched enemies on the nexus that makes World War 1 seem like child's play? Guardian Angel. 

Since the new changes i've totally abandoned Black Cleaver, Trinity its just disgusting good on us now."
GarenMains,f3b3ec8,t3_dg8qit,1570800564.0,"Guys, the champ si broken because of how easy E triggers Conqueror. Lvl 2 you do Basic, Q & E and you just destroy whoever is in front of you. They should remove that feature and maybe increase E damage.

I've been climbing non-stop since this change."
