BPD,ezti484,t3_d28mbd,1568130861.0,"Dont make him understand your side. First, be humble, tell him youre really sorry and thats not how you wanted things to go and that you didnt want to fight, you were just feeling ________. Usually for me its hard to identify the feeling that causes me to fight, certain things trigger some serious defense mechanisms of mine. I struggle to communicate my negative emotions in a calm and relaxed way. Apologize for your wrongs, and chances are he will apologize for his wrongs too. Then communicate about how the both of you can prevent another bad argument like that in the future. Work together as a team."
BPD,ezthc06,t3_d296h2,1568130333.0,"What emotions do you use food to avoid?

I personally use food to run from uncomfortable feelings. Facing those feelings or avoiding them in a healthy way even, stop my bad coping mechanisms. Such as feeling really anxious so I was the dishes and clean my house. Trading a self destructive coping mech for a good and productive coping mech"

BPD,ey9j0f1,t3_cwbfs3,1566944468.0,"Dont invalidate yourself by thinking those things you listed arent traumatic for a child. Even some of those alone are enough to cause complex ptsd/ bpd/ etc. I myself used to say the same, others have it worse it really wasnt that bad. But ptsd doesnt lie.  Validate your experiences and the symptoms of your trauma."
Chakras,ey9ibo1,t1_ew0nybw,1566943994.0,"Agreed. You give negative energy/ entities permission to be in you. Take your permission away and ask the one infinite creator to fill your heart with love and protect you.

Fear is a liar. Allow it to wash through you and reclaim responsibility for your life and your pain. Then accept love and happiness that can only come from in you. You are the creator of your own experience."

Meditation,ewijtt2,t3_coh1sh,1565450793.0,"I like both. Depends on the mood. Tool‚Äôs music always put me in a meditative state, at least the album Lateralus."
Meditation,ewijo8v,t3_coh9yj,1565450697.0,I love to meditate to Tool. Even when Im not meditating it puts me in that state if I hear it. It‚Äôs like my soul is going on a journey.
Psychic,ewijg9k,t3_cohhbi,1565450563.0,"You can create your shadow self. I had an experience that shook me to my core with fear and I kept seeing Lucifer‚Äôs face or what I imagined it was when I closed my eyes. So what I did, I realized it wasn‚Äôt him but it was ME. So i created a new face. It was me but dark and painful but also since it was me I felt love not fear, and all the fear dissipated. I realized she wouldn‚Äôt hurt me because I also am her. I dont know if that was my shadow self but she keeps me safe when I am afraid of the unknown. Because she is the unknown. I hope this makes sense"
Empaths,ewij2ou,t3_cohocs,1565450320.0,"When you are wide open in a world that is closed, it takes time to open the hearts of those around you.

It makes people feel comfortable and safe."
Psychic,ewiil7z,t1_ewih4ew,1565450017.0,"I agree. Especially where it shines light on the parts of us that need to heal. It‚Äôs why twin flame, and even just soul group relations are catalysts for spiritual growth.

I have wondered if I am in a twin flame relationship but there‚Äôs no way for me to know. All i know is, I have grown considerably. More in a year with him than i have in all the years prior by myself. I am also aware of the dangers of mislabeling and deceiving myself by doing so, so i do not.

I do think there is legitimacy to twin flame relations as well, but I also agree that many people want to believe they and their partner are meant to be cosmically out of fear of being without them. Almost as a self reassurance, as deceptive as it can be."

lawofattraction,ewigwu3,t3_coiw47,1565448930.0,"It could be that you subconsciously now believe that itll happen for them and not you. Since youve been doing this for a while though, i know you know better than i (only manifested three things the first time and havent tried since, out of fear lol. Im the only one stopping me) that you have to live your life and believe these things are already yours. And once you do that they come to you. If youre doing this i dont know why its not manifesting. Perhaps patience is key. Perhaps other things involving this ex are in the process of shifting in order for the manifestation to work. But also manifestation with other people is iffy because you arent the only one who manifests involved. Because the other person could be manifesting something completely different. But if its yours itll be yours and if its not then the universe is leading you towards something better. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

BPD,eq0ws1g,t1_epxtxtx,1559696166.0,"I do the same shit. Especially when anxious and i dissociate really bad. I could start with one pimple or one bump on my arm (keratosis pilaris is what i have on my arms) and next thing i know its two hours wasted picking at my skin and i look and feel disgusting

Awareness is the first step to stopping. Being aware of what you are doing- picking- and trying to find out why. Think about how someone who loves you wouldnt want you to hurt yourself in that way and be that person who loves you. Its easier said than done. But after 10 years of hours of picking several times a week, sometimes daily, ive reduced it to once a week or less and no where near as long. Theres set backs, times when you relapse, but its important to remember that coping mechanisms dont just stop cold turkey. Sometimes it takes a lot, maybe even a new healthy way of coping to end this behavior"

Psychedelics,eoag4i2,t1_eoag030,1558416687.0,I promise internal reflection wont put you into psychosis. Rewire your thoughts out of love instead of out of fear. Fear plays tricks on the mind- like making you think youre crazy.

Its scary but theres so much more to learn if you are receptive and open to it. Psychedelics reveal the truth about you and the universe. Perhaps some more reflection will bring the answers you search for. Dont be afraid, embrace the new things you learn and apply them. I believe in you"
