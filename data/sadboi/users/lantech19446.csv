bipolar,es7klml,t1_es7gu59,1561672947.0,"well for one the level of fat around your organs is only tested via dex scan or autopsy but it's much more of a risk with a keto diet than a plant based diet still unless the people you know are shelling out thousands of dollars you don't know anyone who knows what those fat levels are, insurance will barely pay for a dex scan when it is need based and the scanners aren't widely available. Secondly increasing insulin resistance is not a good thing but you're right that keto increases it. The problem is this people are judging their diabetic health on the a1c well this is great but to understand the problem you have to understand what an a1c is actually measuring and that's glucosolated hemoglobin if you're making a conscientious effort to eat things that don't challenge your insulin response then obviously your numbers are going to look great because you're not eating things that break down into glucose that doesn't mean that your diabetic health is good it means you're not eating anything to challenge it. The bigger problem with this is our body needs carbs it's our primary energy source it also needs glucose to a certain extent to power our muscles and our brains so while you're eating a ton of fat keeping your body in ketosis which is only a step away from DKA if you don't manage it correctly and thinking your numbers are great you're producing a ton of inflammation potentially destroying your arteries and feeding a bunch of other diabetic risk factors where the people eating a plant based diet or hell even a Mediterranean diet are still challenging their insulin response tuning appropriately (if they're doing it right) including good carbs in their diet and repairing their bodies. I think the reason this isn't more widely known is because the keto diet is much older than people think it is and it's not even the first time we've seen people try to use it for something like this so physicians have compiled data from both diets for the last like 50 years and found  these things to be true but the people doing it now think they've changed the diet enough to fix those things, my bet is on it not being enough. At the end of the day though I know what works for me and that's what I have to do, I'd never wish these things on anyone but I think it's largely misguided and if people understood what the numbers they're using were really measuring they wouldn't be so quick to accept them"

bipolar,es7d1p7,t1_es78lsm,1561668410.0,I was about to say the same thing MrJoeBlow did I was plant based before lost almost 200lbs and kept it off for years had the blood pressure of a marathoner perfect cholesterol numbers etc etc should have never started eating meat again now i'm almost 400lbs my cholesterol is still an acceptable level but inverted I have sleep apnea and i'm possibly diabetic. Eating meat might make your a1c look better but your insulin resistance will be way worse on a keto diet not challenging it doesn't mean it doesn't exist and there's a lot of other health concerns with keto like being outwardly lean but having lots of fat around your organs and in your bloodstream. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy
bipolar,es74oz0,t1_es73vo4,1561663791.0,Thing is i'm not even trying to lose the weight this quickly I'm a BIG guy though almost 400lbs so I'd still be within safe weightloss as long as that doesn't continue for more than a month or so.
