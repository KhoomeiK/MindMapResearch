No matter how embarrassed you were, people don’t think about you that much. You’re not on the forefront of everyone’s mind all the time. Just move past the incident and you’ll be fine.

Being naturally good at high school doesn’t translate to being good in college. That’s because talent does not equal work ethic.

Resist the urge to badmouth your ex, and don’t go nuclear on cutting everything about them from your life. You might wake up one day and realize you really miss them as a friend, but never, ever be able to navigate that as an adult because you both messed things up way too badly, and you’ll mourn the friendship you might have had.

Also, yes, you’re bisexual so just come out and deal with it. Kiss whoever you want. Being inauthentic because you “have” to go one way or the other is a waste of good years of your life."

Grad is a huge deal in our small city (think what senior prom would be like in the states). It was heartbreaking because she kept saying she just wanted to make it until grad, because she wanted to see pictures of everyone she grew up with all dressed up. When she went really downhill suddenly, her friends busted ass to try to make it so the entire year could dress up for grad a week early. They did such a good job contacting everyone, working to get dresses back from being altered, coordinating getting suit rentals early - and then she suddenly died. 

Then, a couple years after graduation, an incredibly lovely guy I was in a high school play with died in a workplace accident.

AskWomen,fplg4m6,t3_ge1tsm,1588712097.0,"Had a few of these in high school... but I had a weird, intense thing as a young adult with a guy, where we had really good chemistry and our paths crossed a couple of times but never at the RIGHT time. 

We met for the first time when we were both single on a dating website. We chatted for a long time and seemed to hit it off, but I was ultimately scared of meeting someone from the internet (this was a decade ago, haha) and ended up deleting my account. Thought I’d never see him again. 

Then we randomly met a year later when we both decided to go back to university as slightly older students. We were both taking a class that we were super excited to be in, and had been in wait lists to get in. We ended up sitting together. We hit it off and had great chemistry immediately, but I was kind of on and off again with someone and he was seeing someone. It took me a while to figure out why I recognized him... until he mentioned a niche interest that I’d only ever heard one guy say they did, and I realized he was the dating website guy! 

We spent a semester of classes hanging out before/after class, usually with other people we’d met, but he typically walked me to my car alone and we had a lot of long talks at that point. Eventually I broke up with the person I’d been with, and there were a few things he and I talked about maybe doing together (concerts, movies) but we never did, I think because he was seeing someone and seemed like way too good a person to mess around with that. I never outright voiced what I thought about us or our chemistry, it was just something we talked around without acknowledging. So, it was just a lot of intense chemistry over books and homework and a study group we formed with classmates (but neither of us really needed for this particular class) until the end of semester. Haven’t seen him since!"

I’m never going to make my kids feel like they have to take care of me, or be hyper vigilant about my moods and feelings, or that they have to act a certain way to be shown love. The goal is for mum and dad to be fully functional adults that support them, not the other way around."

Sleeping with other people to even the score won’t fix this. If he puts some serious work in, he might be able to... to some extent: 

I’ve been with my partner for years and, because he’s older than me, he had a lot more sexual experience. Years ago we broke up for a while and I ended up getting more experience, which helped me in terms of self growth and sexual journey, but didn’t change our dynamic at all when we got back together. The jealousy I had to deal with about his past partners before was still there, as was the feeling that something might be uneven in terms of experience - because I couldn’t go back and change his history. Gaining more experience myself didn’t fix that, even if it did have other good impacts. But us working on our relationship and getting to a point where we were so solid I stopped caring who he was with before (and now I couldn’t care less) did help. 

But, fact is, I think you could use a better husband. Someone who cheated on you and continues to chat up girls, AND who inspires these kinds of feelings... it’s not a good sign, and I think you deserve better."

askpsychology,foatjnb,t1_fo9hxd4,1587652272.0,"I think I could always remember things, but it’s possible that there are some things I don’t. I’ve never had someone refer to something I said/did and not be able to remember it, even if my memory had a different spin on the event. And I mostly could look back and say “no, that didn’t happen/that wasn’t real” until it got worse and I got help. 

Maybe this is because my experiences were comparatively mild (nothing that a change in meds couldn’t fix). But in the training I referenced (mental health first aid), they stressed not agreeing with what people were saying during delusions/psychosis and being consistently respectful because people could typically remember the event and how people/reality reacted to them afterwards. That was the big lightbulb moment for me. I had no clue what I was experiencing was even connected to my mental illness."
askpsychology,foat4xc,t1_fo9mir9,1587652070.0,"Sure. I should say that it wasn’t a very extreme version at all (not bad enough for hospitalization, and just short bursts or phases I guess). 

It usually happened when I was trying to fall asleep, during a period where I wasn’t getting much sleep. It’s happened a couple of times in my adult life, but one period was the worst. I was also stressed out a lot, and started having paranoia about a lot of things in my life, so I was frequently connecting with my doctor anyway at the time which ended up helping me. But to be clear,  it didn’t occur to me until after my workplace training (mental health first aid) that I should tell my doctor this, because depending on the day I either thought it was a weird dreamlike thing or that it was actually real, and she wouldn’t believe me or be able to help me. Once I told my doctor, we upped my meds and worked on some coping skills and I haven’t had it happen since. 

This is the best example to explain. For lack of a better way to describe it, I would think something was trying to possess me (demon? Ghost? Who knows) and I was locked in some intense battle of wills with it. I would feel like someone or something was touching me, which freaked me out the most because it felt 100% real, I just couldn’t see it. I didn’t hear things or see things... but I felt them, and had really strong delusions about what was happening. While it was going on, it felt totally real and I was convinced I knew exactly what it was. 

I would always eventually fall asleep... and when I woke up, I’d remember everything, but just sort of wrote it off as something weird that happened or a dream, even though I knew I was awake and moving around. Eventually, it happened frequently enough that in the mornings I started thinking it was real too, and that I wasn’t safe at night - while at the same time I could still think about it rationally and know that couldn’t be true.

Edit: I have bipolar, I believe the diagnosis is still considered type 1, but can’t recall if it changed due to all this. I also had a tough childhood so I’ve experienced dissociating and PTSD flashbacks, and can say all of this felt completely different."
askpsychology,fo9fn7c,t3_g5yu7k,1587618201.0,"I can say that I had *no* idea the things I was experiencing were psychosis until I was in a training session that explained, really well, what a person experiencing delusions/psychosis went through. All of a sudden it pinged for me... holy shit, that’s me, I need to tell my psychiatrist this. 

Specifically, what hit home for me was the notion that someone could remember all of the “real” things that happened during an episode as well as the crazy things, and when they are fine, they can differentiate them. And also, that it just. Feels. Real. When it’s happening. I can’t stress this enough. I always thought that I would know what “going crazy” feels like... but what it felt like was real life. 

I didn’t realize how bad my paranoia and delusions were until that point. I thought at some points that maybe I was remembering bad dreams and just misremembering them as things I experienced while awake, and other points that super terrible supernatural things happened to me but they were *real*, and I knew that because I could tell the difference between “real” and “my brain going nuts” after most episodes.

A better dose of my meds got rid of all of this. Better understanding of my early stages of mani and paranoia helps too. But it is so strange to think back to these experiences."

He once made a young shoe salesman cry when the salesman asked “how do they feel?” and my dad responded “I don’t know, I’ve been paralyzed for 30 years!” 

Dad joke fail."

AskReddit,fmuceva,t1_fmtkvgu,1586388660.0,"I feel you. Went through this exact process as a teen and young adult, and am left with way fewer - but much better - friends because of it.

I found that once I realized I was accepting toxic traits and stopped doing that, I had no idea where to go from there. How do you flip from attracting toxic people to attracting good ones, when your trust has been completely messed with?"
JUSTNOFAMILY,fmubtrv,t3_fx865p,1586388335.0,"I think it would be hard to problem solve this without first finding out why (as much as you can) they don’t seem to want to meet him. Is it because they like your ex/are siding with him, don’t like divorce, don’t like age differences, have some other prejudices at play? Could it be some old fashioned ideas about “not moving too fast” with having someone be involved with your kid, and they maybe don’t get that you’ve known this guy for a while? Something else? I get the impression that they may be having conversations about you and him, and keep in mind that this can cause a lot of misinformation and assumptions to spread. 

I’d start a conversation with a member or two of your family that you think would be the most open to talking about this, and just phrase it generally as something you’ve noticed or an impression you’ve gotten. Be prepared to get some really out there responses, but try as much as possible to be open to receiving the information and use I language (as some people don’t want to share information if it will “just cause a fight”). Then, plan your next actions accordingly. 

Best of luck, and I’m happy you and your kid have found someone so great to be in your lives!"
relationship_advice,fmuaoqu,t3_fx6pbg,1586387707.0,"I know a girl who treats the men in her life this way and I can tell you, the beginning of this behaviour is the beginning of the end. She does it because she’s completely self-centered, selfish, and maybe a bit narcissistic. She starts her relationships out being caring and empathic but I can tell you from seeing this time and time again, once she starts acting the way your girlfriend is it’s a downhill slide from there. This becomes the new normal in her relationships and she pitches a fit whenever her boyfriends’ lives or problems seem to even slightly overshadow her own. 

If you want to stay with her or you’re not ready to break up, that’s totally your decision. But from my perspective, and from my experience trying as a friend to get a selfish girl to pull her head out of her ass when it comes to relationships, she’s not going to change or magically develop a sense of love or empathy for you. She’s likely going to keep you around insofar as it serves her and her need for attention, someone to vent to, and affection. 

You deserve so, so much better from a partner. You deserve a partner who, at the VERY LEAST, gives a shit when you’re in need. Not this selfish behaviour."

AskWomen,fmrb45u,t3_fwwiyu,1586318288.0,"I am *mortified* by my double chin. No matter how fat or thin I’ve been. 

I’m aware many other people have them. I barely notice if someone else does. But 90% of the time, when I look in the mirror or see a photo of myself, I feel like I’m all chin. 

My partner teases me because I have a (much more noticeable than a flabby chin) habit of hiding the bottom of my face behind things like scarves or my hands because of my chin mortification."

Is it a myth? Yes. Have I ever, *ever* tested it to see? Hell no!"
