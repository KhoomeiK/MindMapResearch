So I went out to a mall, something I have actively tried to avoid, to go and get some tea (I'm trying to replace alcohol with tea for relaxing), 
And a lady working at the store comes up to me and asks if I needed help. I automatically said no. Then I said wait as I remembered talking to someone was the reason I came into the store in the first place..
