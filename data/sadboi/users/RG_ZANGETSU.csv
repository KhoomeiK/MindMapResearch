Sett has plenty of ways to initiate a fight but none to leave one efficiently.   


I mostly just try to freeze the lane and deny CS. I typically do not push up super far, or shove the lane too far up without JG support. My gameplan is just to get my laning opponent behind and keep his ass behind. If you do that you've basically done your job, you've won lane. Any kills you get off of that is just a bonus.   


Sett isn't really the flashy kill explosive carry-a-game-to-victory type of top laner. In my personal experience, he really shines in midgame when laning phase has ended and it's time to run about the map as a team.  


 I really just try my best to get ahead in my lane and then roam around midgame being an annoying ass thicc boi, Facebreaker enemy squishies into my chest while they uselessly throw all their abilities at me, and let the team jump on their asshole. Initiating fights with R is also a good thing to do because you basically get a jump start on damage by chunking half the team."
