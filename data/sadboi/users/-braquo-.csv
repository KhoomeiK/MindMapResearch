KBO,fr4c2u8,t3_gmkuc2,1589883296.0,I enjoy making up in my head what people are saying in the commercials.
KBO,fr4b13x,t3_gmkuc2,1589882221.0,HOLY SHIT. The Twins are going Oprah on Samsung. YOU GET A HOMERUN. YOU GET A HOMERUN. EVERYBODY GET'S A HOMERUN!
KBO,fr4av41,t3_gmkuc2,1589882050.0,I'm a huge lifelong LA Dodgers fan. I read somewhere before the KBO season started that the Twins were most like the Dodgers. It's true. There've been so many Dodgers seasons where they are either on fire hot. Or freezing cold. Also oh fuck. This Korean chicken commercial always makes me so hungry.
KBO,fr4agu1,t1_fr4af7u,1589881643.0,I'm worried now. I posted a bunch of trash-talking comments. I hope I didn't just jinx the Twins lol.
KBO,fr4a52q,t3_gmkuc2,1589881307.0,GOD DAMN! Twins are ruthless today. Two home runs in the first. it's 5-0. LG hung out the black flag today.
KBO,fr4a36y,t3_gmkuc2,1589881251.0,LG seem to be very hot or cold. Looks like we're feeling good today.
KBO,fr49ypd,t3_gmkuc2,1589881124.0,RAMOS! What a great start to the game. Suck a dick Samsung.
KBO,fr49vpl,t3_gmkuc2,1589881040.0,Yeah buddy! 1-0. Chae Eun-sung will always be Harry Potter to me. Because of his glasses. Good RBI Potter. 10 points to Gryffindor.
KBO,fr49nrr,t3_gmkuc2,1589880811.0,Nice little bloop there. Lets go Twins!
KBO,fr49b3j,t3_gmkuc2,1589880443.0,Good news everyone! My internet at work has decided to stop being fucking shit and I can stream games on Naver again! Hooray!
KBO,fqwf9ux,t3_gl7y3s,1589702338.0,Everytime Boog talks about something not related to this game my hatred for him doubles.
KBO,fqwdssl,t1_fqwdhyk,1589700872.0,It's hands down the worst I've ever seen. So bad. They're not interested at all. And they're both shitty commentators and annoying people.
KBO,fqwdikt,t3_gl7y3s,1589700592.0,The Comeback is on!
KBO,fqwbbgy,t3_gl7y3s,1589698467.0,The best part of the ESPN broadcast is when there's an audio problem and no one talks for like 30 seconds.
KBO,fqwakz0,t3_gl7y3s,1589697787.0,NOBODY CARES ABOUT YOUR FUCKING PICTURES IN THE BACKGROUND.
KBO,fqwaiki,t3_gl7y3s,1589697725.0,FUCK. This game is not gong well. Plus I'm forced to listen to the dumb ass ESPN commentators since my work internet isn't great and it doesn't like Naver or Kakao. I am straight up not having a good time.
KBO,fqw9jk1,t1_fqw9clp,1589696831.0,I normally watch the korean streams. But for some reason the past two nights I've worked (I work graveyards) I haven't been able to get a steady stream on Kakao or Naver. It goes for a few seconds. Then buffers. Then goes for a few more seconds. It's so frustrating. So I'm stuck watching fucking ESPN.
KBO,fqw92rf,t3_gl7y3s,1589696419.0,"Thundering Jesus I can't stand Sciambi. I have a hatred of ESPN, so don't watch many games on the network and never really noticed him till KBO. Fuck me. He's so annoying."
KBO,fqw6xoa,t3_gl7y3s,1589694609.0,Dear LG Twins. I've had a horrible fucking past three days. It's basically all been shit. Now I'm back at work. Can you please give me some happiness and win tonight?

KBO,fqlhs04,t3_gjirzj,1589458454.0,FUCKING HELL ESPN. IT'S A TIE GAME IN BOTTOM OF THE 8th. STOP DOING INTERVIEWS ABOUT MLB AND CALL THE GAME.

KBO,fqlb17d,t1_fqlarfg,1589452508.0,eh that's a good point. I'd be absolutely crushed if the Dodgers had done that.
KBO,fqlavjf,t1_fqlajb9,1589452356.0,"No, it's a smallish independent shelter. But it's a good place, as far as homeless shelters go. Several people who have stayed here have said that it's one of the best shelters they've stayed at. So that's cool.

KBO,fqlaj2m,t1_fqladrx,1589452024.0,Hahaha So speaking of that. Monday was THE SLOWEST MOST BORING SHIFT EVER. It just dragged by. I'm pretty sure time stopped and I was actually at work for like two days.
KBO,fqla1qc,t1_fql9yw7,1589451551.0,"So I'm a Dodgers fan, but you probably guessed that. I started looking at KBO teams. Saw there was a Giants team and they have the same colors and similar logo and was automatically like welp. They're eliminated from a team I will consider cheering for."
KBO,fql9ytl,t1_fql9u3z,1589451468.0,"Yeah that's one of the things I love about him. I love a good, smart, base runner who can steal a base."

KBO,fql9irt,t3_gjirzj,1589451021.0,"So, I work graveyard shift at a homeless shelter. I've loved watching the KBO during my shift. But because of this I now get very annoyed when actually doing my job pulls me away from games. Usually it's really quiet. But I do have some things I have to do and I always find myself getting annoyed now at having to do my job and missing the baseball."
KBO,fql8q92,t3_gjirzj,1589450220.0,I love those glasses. Pro athlete rocking the Harry Potter glasses.

KBO,fql8a7n,t3_gjirzj,1589449769.0,THe internet at work has apparently decided it hates me tonight. Can't get Naver to work at all. And Kakao works for a second then just buffers forever. Way to fuck up my night work internet!

KBO,fqh1n1r,t3_giv8qh,1589364719.0,REally great start to the game for the Twins today. This team is fun to watch when we're not playing terribly like in the first few games.

KBO,fqgzt5h,t3_giv8qh,1589362899.0,Lee Chun-woong is quickly becoming one of my favourite players. He's had a good couple of days.
KBO,fqgzl8e,t3_giv8qh,1589362675.0,Good first inning for the Twins.
KBO,fqgzgim,t3_giv8qh,1589362539.0,I think thats an out.
KBO,fqgz51a,t3_giv8qh,1589362213.0,Okay Twins lets keep this going. Remember my pep talk from the comeback win against the Dinos. Let's try to suck less.
KBO,fqd731x,t3_gi7fk8,1589281958.0,Great inning for the Twins!
KBO,fqd66kb,t1_fqd64bz,1589281106.0,Do you have a deep hatred of e.e. cummings?
KBO,fqd64zn,t3_gi7fk8,1589281064.0,Great base running there. Lee Chun-woong is having himself a solid game.
KBO,fqd560r,t1_fqd53uy,1589280112.0,He's really having a good game. He's been great aside from the homerun.
KBO,fqd53ct,t3_gi7fk8,1589280039.0,"I really like this whole Twins not being terrible thing. We should try to do it more. Also, for the record. The Twins have started playing a lot better since I told them to stop sucking in a game thread during the Dinos game."
KBO,fqd50a4,t1_fqd4u5g,1589279953.0,"They definitely seem to love the Dinos. I think the Twins have only been on once. The Twins had another game scheduled, but it got rained out."

KBO,fqczuo9,t3_gi7fk8,1589274693.0,"God I'm glad baseball is back. Yesterday suuuucked. I work graveyards so I've absolutely loved being able to come in spend the first three hours of my shift doing everything I need to get done, then watch baseball. Yesterday with no KBO, it was the longest, most boring shift I think i've ever worked. Lets fucking go Twins. Lets wreck some Wyverns."

KBO,fq54ovs,t3_gguej8,1589092425.0,Ah fuck I thought that was going to be fair
KBO,fq54lzd,t3_gguej8,1589092351.0,Man maybe all that's been wrong this season was that I hadn't told the twins to score runs.
KBO,fq54gsx,t3_gguej8,1589092221.0,I love a stolen base. Come on LG let's get a few more.
KBO,fq53zlt,t3_gguej8,1589091787.0,Hey! They listened to my advice!

KBO,fq5194v,t3_gguej8,1589089444.0,Gah. Just got to work and put the game on. Looks like it's business as usual for the Twins.
KBO,fq107zb,t1_fq0xw5p,1589039973.0,I've only watched one game on ESPN. I watch on Naver too. I'd rather not understand than watch ESPN shit coverage.
KBO,fq0wh27,t3_gge4q6,1589038506.0,I have hated it. I have gotten really into the KBO (GO TWINS) It's really nice because I work graveyards. So I get to go to work and watch baseball all night. But ESPN's broadcasts are terrible. The random guests where they don't even pay attention to the game for 2 innings. The lack of any personal coverage. and how they only show the one game a night. Like I get they CAN only show one live game. But they could easily show replays of the other games during the day. Instead of watching fucking dipshit sports debate shows who have nothing to debate about.

KBO,fprc87i,t3_gf31cu,1588849909.0,I have to stop missing the start of innings. Literally Doosan have not scored a run tonight when I'm watching. It's just when I walk away.
KBO,fprc2i9,t1_fprbzsh,1588849759.0,FUUUUCK. I went out to smoke. IT REALLY IS MY FAULT.
KBO,fprbak2,t3_gf31cu,1588849020.0,I'm going to keep following the KBO even after this is over and MLB comes back. I work graveyard shifts at a homeless shelter. There's nothing to do and watching the games is great. TWINS FOR LIFE BAYBAY.

KBO,fprb5fg,t3_gf31cu,1588848882.0,Oh man I really thought that was going fair. I was all excited.
KBO,fprb2sv,t1_fpray54,1588848810.0,I really have to pee. But I'm holding it till the inning is over. I'm becoming more and more convinced I am the good luck charm.
KBO,fprawkx,t3_gf31cu,1588848644.0,SAFE! Good hitting. Atta boy Park Yong-taik.
KBO,fpratbx,t3_gf31cu,1588848556.0,That's a good way to start the inning. Chae Eun-sung is having a good game at the plate.
KBO,fprapph,t1_fprag9i,1588848457.0,When I was picking a team. I started looking at the teams. And instantly ruled out being a Lotte Giants fan.

KBO,fprakpt,t3_gf31cu,1588848322.0,Good catch by our RF. Lets get those runs back.
KBO,fprah9p,t3_gf31cu,1588848226.0,"Guys, i'm sorry. Doosan taking the lead is my fault. It took me a bit to find a stream and when I started watching we were down 1-0. Then we tied it. And I went outside to smoke. And Doosan takes the lead again. Clearly I am LG's good luck charm. I won't leave anymore during this game."
KBO,fpr9fgw,t1_fpr9ceo,1588847176.0,I'll keep following the KBO even after MLB restarts. I work graveyards so these games are the perfect thing to watch during my long boring shift at work. TWINS FRIENDS FOREVER.
KBO,fpr9c3u,t3_gf31cu,1588847080.0,Jung Chan-heon is looking good today.
KBO,fpr90wf,t1_fpr8yof,1588846766.0,Yeah it has! BTW I always smile when I see your username. Because you answered a question for me on one of the first games. I tagged you on RSS as TWINS FRIEND.
KBO,fpr8xz5,t1_fpr8ucu,1588846686.0,went to the naver tv website. Then on the left side bar there's a line that has a green thing that says Beta next to it. That's live streams. Click on that and then there's thumbnails that show who is playing. I had to change my vpn to Korea though.
KBO,fpr8ppk,t3_gf31cu,1588846455.0,Damn Oh Ji-hwan was swinging for the fences there. Not a bad inning. Looking like this will be a pretty good game.
KBO,fpr8i6t,t3_gf31cu,1588846241.0,"Yeah buddy! Twins are looking good today. I have only been a Twins fan for a few days. But I can say Fuck Doosan, with all the same hatred I harbor for the San Fransico Giants."
KBO,fpr8b87,t3_gf31cu,1588846045.0,There we go LG. Nice double by Chae Eun-sung.
KBO,fpr87ew,t1_fpr83qp,1588845936.0,"Yeah, I heard they'd shortened the time. It's just annoying on plays like that. Dude was out be like three feet. It was clear he was out on the live view. But the umps still took the whole alloted time to make the call. Just a pet peeve of mine."
KBO,fpr7ynx,t3_gf31cu,1588845687.0,"This is what I hate about reviews. WHY DO YOU TAKE ALL THE TIME WHEN IT""S CLEAR AS FUCK HE WAS OUT?! Speed that shit up."
KBO,fpr7s7w,t3_gf31cu,1588845503.0,On the live view the runner looked out as fuck to me. Pretty sure he got tagged on the head.
