I had two experiences with sleep paralysis. In the most remarkable one I actually cried myself to sleep, only to wake up with tears flooding from my eyes without any control while I couldn't properly breath. After a feel seconds, when I really thought I was drowning or suffocating, I started see faces but there were from people of my daily life. People I thought I would never see again.

That was a terrible experience, but I'm sure that if I had experienced something like yours sleep paralysis, I probably would NEVER sleep again."

My abilities were nothing like theirs, but I could win time to time. And this always made me proud. 

I tried to play Domino with some friends a few times later in my life only to realize that they have pretty poor skills.

I'm 23 and I'm in a relationship with my boyfriend for 7 years and a half. We started dating when I was 16 and I still think that was the best decision I could make. 
I love my boyfriend and really enjoy every moment we spend together, so it really upsets me when people ask me if we aren't sick or tired of each other. 

We live together for two years now. We also work at the same building (separate areas, though) and study at the same University (same campus, but different courses so we take different classes) and all that people usually ask me about my relationship is: ""Don't you need a break from him???"" 
Christ, no i don't! Why would I date someone i don't want spend time with??
 We work at the same building but spent about 7h apart working in our own projects. We study at the same University but still apart from each other during the classes hours. So the only time we actually truly spend together during week is a couple hours at home before going to sleep and our lunch break... I'd love to have more hours with him if a could...

I don't know why people don't ask me more relevant and interesting things like:  ""How was it grown together as people?"" Or ""Do you regret anything?"" So i could answer them: ""Amazing! Definitely made me who I'm"" and ""Definitely no!"" kind of stuff.

Everyone ever assume that i was too young when started dating so, ""logically"", I must regret not enjoying my youth, but my youth would be much more boring and sad if i was single..."
