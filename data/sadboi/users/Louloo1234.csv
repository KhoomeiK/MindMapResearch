KidsAreFuckingStupid,fr43uwe,t1_fr41b1y,1589874894.0,Ok. Thanks for clearing that up.
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fr3raqm,t1_fr2n5uj,1589864140.0,"I know what you're saying and I'm not saying its definitely not learnt behaviour, a portion of it will be 100%.But all I'm saying is he could have underlying issues and to get certain services involved to rule it out and help the care givers better ways to handle  him and the situation better. ."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fr3qt8k,t1_fr2qwgi,1589863779.0,"Why be so rude and verbally aggressive. I've said it COULD be learnt behaviour, did I not? But there could be also underlying issues.  

Not everything can be remedied by beating a child!!!"
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fr1uksx,t1_fr1t0h8,1589826202.0,"But as I said i don't think spanking would remedy his issue's/ behaviour in this instance. He attacked back in the video. Im not a professional but my niece had serve behavioural issues and was diagnosed with adhd and aspergers, which once addressed her behaviour got so much better. If he saw  a child therapist and a behaviourist it could rule certain things out.  But i appreciate not everyone has access to these services. 

I wish them well. I really do. I used to see how much it drained my sister."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fr1sufj,t1_fr1idz0,1589825358.0,"Haha. For some reason I don't  think a spanking would faze him tbh. I think it would  add ""fuel to his fire"". He would just act out further and seriously fight back. He's small so now so his family can handle him strength wise, but he will soon grow and become bigger and stronger. Then that's when it becomes seriously scary. But im hoping he will change, for everyone's sake."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fr0slny,t1_fr0mblw,1589805699.0,"But not everyone can have children. So by default does that automatically mean they will be miserable? 

See in the uk having multiple children is seen as lazy, as we have free health care, housing system and benefits. So people took advantage of that and where having multiple children so they didn't have to work and in some cases where still neglectful towards their children which caused a end less cycle for further generations. But lucky they have capped that , to just two children. So if you have a third child you're made to financially support the third one which ultimately the kids suffer. Because people in the benefit system are struggling as it is with the two but some people do it so they dont have to work.  Then theres people who have kids for the wrong reasons to ""mend a relationship"", "" someone to look after me when I'm older"""" and some just ""use said child as an accerorize"".... but it's wrong and once again ultimately the kids who suffer. ..

My personally reason, well main reason for not having children are, I experience serve mental health issues and have since I was a child and sometimes I toy with the idea of having a kid' as children are a blessing and bring so much joy. BUT my mental health would have significant and profound affects on the child. Which is not fair...

Just because we are put on this earth to reproduce doesn't mean we all have to. Look at those who reproduce and do some unspeakable things to their kids. Not all people who can reproduce should. 

A family doesn't have to be mum, dad and kids. Times have changed. It can be a woman her two friends and pet dogs. You don't have to be blood related to be family. 

It goes back to what I said before a successful life is someone who does what they want to make them happy, as long as they don't hurt no one. 

But we will agree to disagree.... stay safe in these unprecedented times we are in. 

Have a good day."
