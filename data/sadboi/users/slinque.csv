I eat. While I have struggled with eating disorders before, I never mentioned it in there. It was assumed because I was thin. 

These girls spent nearly every class talking about how the world hated them for being fat, and how I— someone with chronic illness and aspergers, would never understand how it felt to be bullied because I  attractive and small. 

One talked about changing her doctor because the doctor told her her health problems likely stemmed from being overweight. Because that was ‘discrimination.’ 

Another one said she wouldn’t get hired because of her weight. She would bring family bags of chips and a two liter of Mountain Dew to class. Was always in pajamas and stank.

Sad because I’m supposed to compete in a pageant in June and I have an aching feeling it’ll be postponed. I have asthma so I have taken it seriously all along. One of Mom’s coworkers made my brother and I both masks which I appreciate. I live in the mountains and the only outing I’ve made was to hike to the top of one of our local mountains for that clean, non polluted air. Didn’t run into anybody and it was cold, but the air kept me from losing it. 

My community is very small and rural and built on small businesses. It’s really sad to hear about how those people are suffering. Several local businesses are doing curbside pickup because they really cannot afford to shut down and pay their employees. My mom brought me a salad from one of them today and left them a ten dollar tip because realistically, several of the boutiques and antique stores have had their lights shut off. It’s really, really sad. 

We had our first confirmed case in my county. The county beside (most people travel there for work, myself included) has around 20 now that they have the kits to test. I suspect it’s going to skyrocket as the college is there. 

I have 6 animals at home. 3 are 13-15 year old dogs, so they’ve not only kept me company but absolutely kept me sane. I’m in graduate school and the zoom meetings are still going on so things can feel normal.

My grandparents raised me when I was very young and when I was in latwe middle school my mom got promoted to management at her hospital and could control her hours so she could keep me during the week and that was such a huge thing for me. My dad lives across the yard from my grandmother and I still stayed at her house more than I wanted to stay there because his girlfriend is really cruel. 

The ironic part is that she doesn’t make enough money to survive and he constantly complains about it. She’s pretty dependent on him but he still won’t let her live with him because there’s too much tension because she dislikes me and he dislikes her kids. They’ve been together for over ten years somehow. I hate her. 

But I would always beg to see my mom and sometime would sleep on a cot at the hospital just because it meant I’d be closer to her. I kept her pillow until I was in HIGH SCHOOL. 

I see my dad for lunch about once every couple weeks and it tends to be decent as long as the conversation is pretty surface level. He still thinks I’m way younger than I am because he wasn’t there. It’s sad because I can see that he loves me but we just don’t understand one another. He’s done fine as a business owner but has never worked for anyone other than his own parents so he doesn’t get the demands of a job that the average person has.

He was obsessed with me working forever, and now that I have a job in my career field(libraries) he is more supportive of me going back to my old grocery store position that was part time and bad pay because to him that’s “real work”. 

I went over for dinner a few weeks ago to tell him I had gotten full time, and before I even get it out, he tells me “you know, the problems with women now, and this includes girls your age, is that they’re more focused on working than staying home and caring for the kids and husband, so the husband doesn’t have dinner waiting when he gets home.”"

I’m a super busy girl. I compete in contests that require lots of travel and physical discipline. I am also starting graduate school come January. While part of me does want a relationship, I am very aware that the time commitment would suck as I go into my most active season for the very last time (I am aging out and trying to win a lot of scholarship to pay for graduate school). 

With that said, and without going into too much detail, now that I HAVE experienced some physical intimacy, I’m not really ready to give that up. I have been working through a condition called vaginismus (I hate that word) that made any sort of penetration excruciatingly painful, to the point that I’ve never been able to use a tampon. This guy was super patient with me and I allowed my mind to associate touch with pleasure instead of the pain that came with my abuse when I was younger. 

That feeling is very liberating, and now that I’ve sort of come in touch with my sexual side, I want to continue learning about the side of me that craves physical intimacy way more than I thought I did! Huge success for me. 

So what I’m thinking about telling him is this:

I’m not in a great spot for a serious relationship right now either, so I respect that. With that said, I have really enjoyed fooling around with you and hope we can continue seeing one another and having fun. However, I want to be sure that if you or I are seeing anyone else, that you use protection to be safe. I also think it’s fair that if you or I start developing feelings for one another, we voice it and reevaluate then, and if we begin getting feelings for someone else, that is voiced as well.

My dad’s girlfriend sent me a screenshot of her son’s wedding invite today. He had to give her my number because I’ve been no contact with her since i was 18. My dad has been dating this woman since I was 12. When I was 12, her son (the wedding is for him) molested me. I went to the school counselor and threatened suicide. They called both of my parents. She’s done some pretty awful stuff to me, and I’ve been over it with my dad close to a hundred times. I’m 23 and see him at most once a week— the most of a relationship I’ve had since they’ve been together. 

I’ve been going to a trauma counselor and worked through a lot of these issues with her, but my biggest thing is pretending she and my stepbrother don’t exist. After I got this message, I texted my dad and told him I wasn’t upset with him, but that I wouldn’t be attending for obvious reasons, and he was fine...

But then he started asking me why I dislike her so much. I’ve told him all of it so many times and I told him I wouldn’t go over it with him again. I know he’s playing dumb to protect himself here but it hurt my feelings the most because he has been told by multiple people. I blocked her completely on everything and her son as well.

I went to the school counselor and threatened suicide. They called both of my parents. She’s done some pretty awful stuff to me, and I’ve been over it with my dad close to a hundred times. I’m 23 and see him at most once a week— the most of a relationship I’ve had since they’ve been together. 

I’ve been going to a trauma counselor and worked through a lot of these issues with her, but my biggest thing is pretending she and my stepbrother don’t exist. After I got this message, I texted my dad and told him I wasn’t upset with him, but that I wouldn’t be attending for obvious reasons, and he was fine...

But then he started asking me why I dislike her so much. I’ve told him all of it so many times and I told him I wouldn’t go over it with him again. I know he’s playing dumb to protect himself here but it hurt my feelings the most because he has been told by multiple people. 

Some people have said no contact, but I want to have a small relationship with him. It’s been a frustrating day."

insaneparents,fb43y0x,t1_fb3b8wb,1576500884.0,"I have a friend who’s been married for less than six months. His wife has three children. He refers to all of them as his kids. Never step kids. Just his kids. 

In most ways, my mom’s boyfriend has been my dad. He tells people I’m his daughter and I’ve been at every family even since they got together. 

Some people do it right. Then there are these people."
vaginismus,fazwg21,t1_fazad1e,1576420253.0,He doesn’t want a big relationship right now and I’m okay with that and still think it could go that way. He devotedly has been patient and helped me feel sexy in my skin which is huge for me

vaginismus,fags0ba,t1_fagavnr,1576069406.0,Definitely think I wound up starting partway through— lol. Didn’t at first but I’m still bleeding. BUT I can’t try to use tampons again and bet I CAN now!!

mentalillness,f91nncv,t3_e377b6,1574995571.0,"IOP legit saved my life. I went at the end of last year/ beginning of this year due to a suicide attempt, severe anxiety and manic depression, and PTSD. I was worried about being in a group and especially my first day when I walked in and saw someone I knew. However, we took confidentiality very seriously and she and i opened up to one another almost instantly. 

We would meet every other day for 3 and a half hours with a break in the middle. My actually group became very close knit considering we were all talking about personal things and trying to help one another while focusing on ourselves. 

What we did varied. We did CBT every day and usually some sort of art, yoga, music, and meditation practice, all of which I use on a literal daily basis. We also had individual sessions with moth the psychiatrist and therapist on a weekly basis. 

I still keep up with most of my group on social media and from the looks of it, all are doing better and have benefitted from the process. My number of panic attacks have greatly decreased and I’ve dealt with my depression in a much healthier manner."
BoJackHorseman,f91n4tj,t1_f91mzae,1574995111.0,I want him to end up okay so bad. He’s done so much and I cried tears of happiness for his character’s growth. I want him to succeed.
