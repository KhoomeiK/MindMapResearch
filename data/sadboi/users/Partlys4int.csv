In a way, I envy you.

My twin brother thinks he knows me, but as a matter of fact, he doesn't. At all. He's also been used to the societal concept of a twin bond. But I remember really early on being tired of always having to watch over him and guide him. It has wasted a good part of my life and still gives me anxious feelings of entrapment. 
He looks up to me and I find that really eerie being the same age and all and looking alike. Especially as I have not once really looked up to him. And then that makes me feel guilty.
And I wonder if the societal concept is responsible for that or if he would have turned out the same without the twin concept. 

Truth is, what you find in your twin, that she totally gets you and knows you, I have never felt in my life. I get my twin  brother as I do with other people. And people cling to me and exhaust me because of that. And my whole life I've been trying to find someone who totally gets me as so many people do, but to no avail ."

Twins,fprcn03,t1_fphd53n,1588850293.0,"> it feels like losing a part of yourself when they are away.

See, I'd really like if this concept of being two halves of a soul, would stop being purveyed. It's a toxic concept that can make many twins uncomfortable and questioning if they are trapped, if they are an anomaly even.
I'm sure that is what sparked the feud between Olly Murs and his twin brother; Olly not realising that his brother is more than a part of himself to project onto whenever he feels sad or happy or angry."
Twins,fprbme1,t3_gdc4a3,1588849337.0,"It has got to do with the shared time between you. If so much of your life has been spent close, it becomes a different environment when he's not near. 

See this as a good thing; I know firsthand how debilitating and traumatic it can be to not allow your personal self to develop and rely on your mutual identity as society instills in us.
There's this almost mythical idea that twins have a special bond due to being twins and genetically close. There's no science to proof that it comes merely from being twins. It comes as a natural consequence of sharing many moments together, as soldiers become very close if they have experienced war trauma together, as survivors of disasters become very close, etc.

Now you've got all the time you need to work on your own sense and get used to it. It will allow for a better life with and without your twin brother.

Personally, I'd like nothing more than to live a life far away from my twin brother with the occasional visit. My twin life has been coloured by always taking the initiative and being the role model (not merely for my twin brother) and also by traumatic events. When I spend too long with my twin brother, I lose sense of who I am. And perhaps he loses sense of who he is as he's always relied on me.
I cannot recall many moments where I relied on him, except for a few minor moments as technique in sports etc.

But this is tremendously exhausting and I've only recently accepted the idea that I'm too strong of a personality and that I've hurt myself by following the societal idea of twins always together and also my twin brother by overshadowing him and serving as an easy focal point and therefore not allowing him to bloom.

Have you ever thought, maybe your brother wants this to explore himself, his own Self?"

I'm a twin brother. I might have overshadowed his life. Sometimes I know he looks up to me and sometimes I catch him feeling intimidated.  That's one life I squandered.  Who knows what he would have become if life hadn't played this gruesome trick on him?

He's been hyperventilating at times; sometimes real, other times to push the idea to us that he's really ill. He has brushed aside suggestions that he should Skype with a therapist be""he's really ill"".Adding to the problem is the fact that he stopped using steroid nasal spray (which has was using since a year continously...against my warnings), and now that he's stopped over fear that it exacerbates a possible COVID-19 pathology, he breathes a little more difficult and he had one nosebleed (ironically we don't hear him sniffing when he thinks no one is around.

fountainpens,fixd5im,t1_fixd056,1582818011.0,Exactly what I did. It worked well for the first 3 times. Then the blue seal got too loose somehow and popped right through. It's a poor construction.
fountainpens,fixcd4m,t1_fixa6ps,1582817540.0,The price difference must account for something.
fountainpens,fixcaus,t1_fixc2g4,1582817504.0,I had just filled my Pelikan m405 and wanted to screw the lid on again. The blue seal popped up. And kept doing after repeated tries.
fountainpens,fix59tn,t3_facofa,1582812984.0,I'm just glad this didn't happen while stuffed in a bag. No more ink fillers for me.

Hairloss,fhhwy6n,t1_fhhw9qk,1581613385.0,Yes it does. Unhealthy scalp makes for unhealthy hair
Hairloss,fhhftw1,t3_f3955t,1581603180.0,"Technically it is hairloss. Progressive hairloss though? I think it should grow back once you fix your scalp's itching problem. Try using an organic shampoo and really work your fingers to massage it in (John Masters Rosemary and Mint is my fav). Also massage your scalp twice a day for 4 minutes each, you can use your fingers for that also. Until you can feel your veins beating."
SuicideWatch,fh81106,t3_f1k2e1,1581349614.0,"Your parents won't know peace, don't kid yourself. If they wanted to get rid of you, they would just throw you out and not spend a lot of money on a place of your own.

I don't know the dynamics in your family, but sometimes neither is to blame. The relationship has just become explosive and you need to be apart from one another. Your father might be on to something with his offer;

Don't waste this chance. Being alone with responsibilities to provide for yourself could well be that push you need to find a reason. Take that reason please."
offmychest,fh7xdrt,t3_f1iqz3,1581347155.0,"Knowing something about the synapses in the nervous system, it's easy to explain. Earlier memories are so much deeper engrained in our memory. This is what makes her love for John feel more real, even though she may have loved your grandpa more than John; when her memory was disintegrating, her memory of John would stand longer than the one for your grandpa.

It's beautiful but no reason to be upset for your grandpa if he would have been."
fountainpens,fh7ew3l,t1_fh6j8ik,1581328245.0,Should have left that in the post then. Okay

I would feel betrayed in his position."
breakingbad,fh2d10a,t3_f0vkt2,1581246916.0,"This was Skylar at the worst of her former complacent self, where everything was about her (even Walt's treatment was about her and her emotions).
But at the end of the show, when she was sitting there at a shabby table smoking a cigarette, I saw a different woman. A woman stripped of her pride but so much more venerable. It was in her eyes,  in her composure too, with which she held herself together.
When she silently shed a tear watching Walter hold their daughter one last time, it was clear to me that this was a wise woman. Heck, a matriarch even. No sign of her shallow former being to be detected any longer.

That's what subtle directing and great acting are capable of. I hated Skylar like the plague but there she was; a woman I looked up to in her final scenes.

What a show (and what a great actress)."
fountainpens,fg3dl3w,t1_f8rqj41,1580478730.0,"I've got steel, copper and Fireblue Liliputs. Personally, I think the clip really adds to the design of the first two.  For the Fireblue it's undesirable. 
I couldn't imagine taking a Liliput without a clip now. It's so easy to lose them otherwise...

For the Supra, which I've also got and only use with a converter (thus fully extended), I don't see the need of a clip per se. Especially as the Supra is my 'desk Liliput'."
