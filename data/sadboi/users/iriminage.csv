Their parents thought they were OK to not take citizenship - they objected to swearing an oath to the Queen, and the kids never got the option. 

To everyone who thinks that those kids, and others, have opted out of your 'support' by their choices, I'd say you need to wake up and know that you owe them for supporting you as part of Australian society. Your privilege will erode quickly when you judge people as outsiders.

malementalhealth,fib2sco,t3_f7fcy7,1582313445.0,"Superficial advice (from someone m58 outside US): you've obviously worked very hard both in terms of your career and your self development. You have good values that you've stood up for even under strong pressure. You have encountered and faced the things we don't want: personal issues with mental health, and the ill-health of a child. You have figured out how to make a good relationship with your wife despite the difficult start. You have some serious skills.

Your dark cloud is probably still anxiety, though maybe in forms you haven't learned to deal with through your previous journeys. We love anxiety - it comes for us whenever it can, even when we think we have everything sorted. Our logical mid brain tears us away from our higher functions and throws us to our amygdala in our lizard brain where the fight or flight decision flashes 'danger danger' signals that we then try to explain logically and conceptualize as dark clouds or midlife crisis or whatever metaphor fits. The external political metaphor (especially in the US, whether we're there or not) is very strong at the moment and is producing a lot of 'from the gut' (lizard brain)  behaviour.  

Bottom line is, your perceptions are your feelings and will define your reality. I get a lot of comfort from (mostly secular) Buddhism, especially daily sitting meditation to calm my emotions. You seem to have developed good capabilities for compassion in helping your wife and daughter. Working on self-compassion, maybe through guided meditations, could be a way for you to learn to give yourself a break and calm your mid-brain down without engaging in its 'logic'. Aroha nui."

>and this past month  almost every morning i wake up i get anxiety like my heart racing and  finding hard to breath like something is in my lungs. Not only that but sometimes i may have the feeling of bursting out of crying.

Yes, you have the physical symptoms that tell you you have anxiety. You're afraid for some reason and it is showing in your body and emotions.

>Another  thing is that my grandma and mother both have depression and mostly my  mother has anxiety and stress herself (maybe its in the genes? Honestly i  have zero clue if somehow my mom having anxiety has to do anything with  me).

Genes don't matter so much, I think. Fact is, if both your mother and your grandmother are afraid (anxious) and pessimistic about the future (depressed) then that will affect you, because you rely on them to protect you and to help you to be optimistic about your future. If your mother is afraid then you are doing exactly what evolution has trained you for - sticking tight to her and being wary of what she is wary of.

There are enough right-wing politicians who believe this is a good idea to get started in their own place of work. Or maybe this is just another piece of ad-hoc bullshit of the sort that falls regularly out of the mouths of ""libertarians"" in the hope that we will say ""yes, why not?"", when it is actually society-wrecking inanity that only a student would fall for. Yes David, it's obvious that dividing our society more into winners and losers will benefit us all."
PersonalFinanceNZ,epl1dcy,t3_bv3u3i,1559285420.0,"In terms of getting your stress down, remember that it's only a letter. A piece of paper. It's not your future lost, or all the things your brain's (logically and reasonably) putting in front of you as possible outcomes of some unknown person perpetrating the massive and sophisticated fraud on the car dealer that you're afraid will mess up your life for months or years. I could have sent that to you. Or the new office girl might have fed the mailing list they just bought from  into the ""congratulations you bought a jag"" email generator and half of NZ just got the same letter. 

If you want to spend the weekend stressing, and wishing it wasn't a long weekend even though you can't change that, you can. Or you can think ""well .... shit ... ain't that a thing ... I'm sure it's going to work out alright"" and chase it up next week when you can actually do something. In the meantime, it means nothing if you can't do anything. If your doctor told you you had 3 days to live, would you give a shit about the letter? Or would you just have a damn good weekend?

Good luck, stay chill."

The English get riled up about the French (supposedly) being dicks, but the French don't really care what the English think. There is an insularity and insecurity in Australia - being a new immigrant there can be difficult as you're treated like a threat.

The Australian business culture (at least what I saw in Sydney) is a lot more cutthroat than NZ's. Aussie management will overtly climb all over each other to get to the top, and will kill the business to stop a competitor getting past. When a related/affiliated Kiwi business comes across, the Aussies will be accommodating and open to some extent, but don't see value in proactively contributing (let alone collaborating which would involve sharing authority). Secretly the Kiwis would love to surpass the Aussies, but the Aussies won't engage because their assumption is that they could do anything the Kiwis have done, should they want to."
newzealand,eopchhw,t3_bsntic,1558760321.0,"Duncan Garner: ""My mistake was thinking 

It's a hit-piece that rates nailing the government for a failed policy over addressing the ongoing problem that the policy was trying to help. Exaggerating the centrality of the policy to the government's credibility is just to make the hit harder.

Of course $600K is never going to be affordable for most of the people who need somewhere to live. Kiwibuild is Labour's attempt to address housing affordability within the current structure of the market. To successfully provide housing (and income security, and sustainable transport, and a transition to carbon-neutral agriculture, etc) the market and the social bargains that it's built on have to change profoundly and Ardern's not ready or able to deliver that yet, especially when half the electorate see no need. Keeping a significantly progressive leader in power so they can mandate radical changes where needed is the challenge of our times."
