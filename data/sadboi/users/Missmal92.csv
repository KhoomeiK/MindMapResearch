poshmark,f81ebms,t1_f7jzcjy,1574164118.0,People who are looking for the real deal will know it when they see it. Especially if you SAY IT :) I suggest not posting in the Boutique because I legitimately think sellers just don't go there to shop as often. Keep your prices how you like them and explain yourself clearly and honestly- real boutique items are special and there are plenty of buyers out there for you :)
poshmark,f81e6g5,t1_f7jthbe,1574163940.0,"**China makes the majority of products here in America**\- Production costs are much cheaper there. They produce the good, the bad and the ugly (by that I mean, the things that you are holding high above others of,   
as you describe, ""quality""- are **also** more than likely made in the same country as the cheap things you seem to despise.)

Aliexpress has cheap as well as quality items for sale- all basically based out of China. People who don't *only* shop ""price low-high"" are familiar with that broad spectrum of items.

What it seems you are referring to are the ***very*** cheap, **inaccurately described** products or items that people sometimes sell.

The idea of Poshmark is that they **offer protection** in forms of: returns, tracking, money-back guarantee policies & the reprimanding for the morally encompassed who carry out disreputable actions. This ensures a safe shopping experience for us. 

So, when it comes to con artists and fakes- they will never *not* be a factor in any industry or on any platform. The difference is that this is not *our* problem- it's Posh's. That's why they get a cut of our take.

**What we could do as buyers and sellers** is **not to judge others** for selling what *you* perceive as cheap, but educate each other on signs of a sketchy situation, having each other's backs as human beings and most importantly- **having fun!** 

Because **that's what life is ALL about :)**"

**Redux has been totally not responding for me for almost a week.**

This **YouTube video** I found *(where from I have adopted a new Grandfather)* is a [silly old man explaining in less than 2 minutes how to fix this week's Exodus Redux problems.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEvi4SRstS0)

&#x200B;

He says:

* Disable redux by holding down select button on it until menu pops up (because it's not working)
* **Go back to Regular Exodus** (or reinstall it like I had to- LINK---->  for **Kodibae Repo**\----->   [http://mega-tron.tv/transform](http://mega-tron.tv/transform))
* Disable Exodus - Enable it - & just Incase, do an update.

I swear to God that's **all I had to do**. I'm back on watching all my favorite pirated shows and movies.

 I don't want to put my email and password in without knowing what the heck is going on. So I ignore it.

I don't know what certificates are. 

I'm looking at the advanced settings right now and there's an option that's turned off:

That option is turned off and I CANNOT turn it on. There's a little puzzle piece next to it and I cannot turn it on. I think the puzzle piece is javascript, right?

I'm reasonably afraid for somebody very well informed of the medical field (with a constant further curiosity). Growing up without a father around isn't something I'm wanting for my potential children so marriage first.

My family is from the south: Texas, Tennessee. Very concentrated family values- breeders. lol. Very decent- range of Christianity, resected law enforcement. Basically, no woman has ever been looked down on for having children in my family. Although marriage is perdinant. 

(This all began about a year ago when we started dating officially.)

When I say accidentally I mean just accidentally: not planning. (Although, in my view, if you're not on birth control and you have sex then get pregnant- it's on purpose... but I digress)

I suppose what I was insinuating was to get accidentally pregnant because I really do want kids- don't want to wait. Getting pregnant without having prior committed to the idea and previously planned everything out. That's my irresponsible, impatient & immature brain thought that I would never act on. 

I'm not financially stable enough for children yet, nor am I certain I will have them with this man. He's a good dad but there are just a million variables.

I also have a serious problem not being able to explain things. It's been a problem for me for about 10 years. I've come to realize it's not all me. People aren't listening, we want people to hear us. We mentally presume nobody will listen so before even saying the thing we try to think of a better way to say it so people will listen or care. But they won't. It feels confusing and we blame ourselves. We think we can't say things well because %99 of the time we get no feedback or response.

People aren't listening. People don't care. And even if they are they're just thinking about what they're about to say when you stop talking.
 Now I just say things how I think them. Word for word. Complete sentences or not. If someone is trying to understand they will.
