JusticeServed,fq29y6y,t1_fq28gt2,1589054165.0,"Can I ask you where a non-lethal place to be shot is? 






How many shots will it take to hit?







Do you shoot once and wait to see if they stop running at you full speed with the intent to seriously hurt you, then follow up with another when you realize you haven‚Äôt hit them. Only for them to be on you by then. Trying to kill you.








Or do you shoot multiple times to make sure you hit an area that‚Äôs non-lethal, risk hitting them multiple times, and cause them to die anyway, except painfully slower because you shot to injure?"
JusticeServed,fq2568d,t1_fq22luf,1589052930.0,"It‚Äôs the first thing you learn when handling a firearm. It‚Äôs a last resort, only when lethal force is necessary. 







If you are pulling your firearm out it should be only because you believe your life is in immediate danger and you are prepared to use deadly force to stop a threat. That‚Äôs it. 









If police wanted to injure they could use their batons, their pepper spray, their tazers. There are many options before your sidearm.











Police, anywhere, will not use their gun for any reason other than deadly force. It puts their life in danger if they do not."
