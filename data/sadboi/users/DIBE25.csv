Girls don't receive more compliments, it depends on the individual. I can tell a girl she looks amazing because I think she does; I don't go and tell people they're ugly, it's better off not hurting someone than demoralizing said individual.

if you find something good about a person tell that person what that is, make them feel better about themselves if it's not true.
