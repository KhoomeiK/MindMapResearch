LSD,fe88z23,t1_fe5pggp,1578923878.0,"i didn't trip since that time, only smoke weed a couple of times. but i'm pretty sensitive to thc so i mostly didn't smoke much. but when i did and it started being a bit psychedelic i felt that strange fear of peeing myself HARD. so i used benzos to cope.

i'm not really sure you should trip again any time soon. let it all sink in, analyze your mind and stuff. try to integrate all the experience and when you feel 'too normal' again then drop some. that's my opinion. but maybe you'll experience ego death if you drop again soon and this problem will wash away.

i also sometimes get triggered by the sound of water, lmao. because when that shit started (i basically had problems with peeing, some kind of paruresis, i was scared of peeing in public or close to people, but now i managed to cope with it because i realised that i just feel too much connected to people while peeing if they hear me, lol), so when it started i realised i wanna pee, which in fact i didn't really wanted to, and spent around 10 minutes in the toilet having a panic attack staring at the morphing wall. then i went back to my friend and he was like 'bro u ok?' and i told him i wasn't. we layed down, i was peaking hard, we were listening to lofi hip hop, and then i was like fuck no i need to turn the light on i feel like i am pissing myself. AND THEN MY MOTHER ALSO CALLED ME AND I LITERALLY HAD THE HEAVIEST PANIC EVER. so when i turned the light on, i looked at my pants and they were ok, and a second after i was kind of parted away from reality, i felt like i didn't have any body or anything and heard the beautiful sound of water in my head, which triggered the fear of OMG AM I PISSING MYSELF RN????? and yeah. i wasn't. that shit escalated heavily. later that night we were sitting on the balcony, i was smoking a ciggie and we were listening to some really existential russian hop (search for хаски - детка голливуд if you are interested, even if you don't understand the lyrics it's just the music that is really depressing and anxious), my mother called me again, i picked up the phone, she was drunk af. i told her everything is fine and i just didn't hear her calling before. from that part everything started to be more calm, we were chilling in the bedroom listening to pixies and i could easily pee with no problem or fear of peeing myself. but when my friend went to sleep and i started being alone it all came back. i couldn't sleep because every time i was passing out i felt that i am peeing myself and i was waking up to check if i did (i didn't pee myself EVEN ONCE, through my entire lifetime). so i came back home, sleepy, tired, made some tea, drank it and then i had to pee, so i was coming out of my room and my mother started asking me if i was ok. i told her i couldn't sleep all night because if was anxious being at a different flat. she was ok but then i went the second time out and she was like 'you're not ok, you're peeing to much' which fucking escalated everything again. much.but yeah. overall it was not a good or bad experience. it was interesting and i had really deep insights. so again my advice is to analyze and integrate all the experience you have and then MAYBE try again.

sending positive vibes again! feel free to write me back anytime"
LSD,fe5p0fk,t1_fdtxjph,1578872450.0,"yeah buddy! 8 months passed from my last trip and it gets better over time, trust me! i realized that it’s connected with anxiety and many people have this trouble even though they haven’t tried psychedelics. so fixing your anxiety helps with that feeling of being scared of peeing yourself. ask me anything you want to, i will be pleased to answer. 

good vibes to you!"

Cigarettes,f2zloxe,t1_f2zlfbw,1570528970.0,"Depends on what part of country we're talking about. I live in Moscow, which is basically a huge city (around 15 milion people) and is more like Europe. Many Russians even claim that Moscow is not really Russia, lol. So the average salary is meant to be around 40-50k rubles, which is around a thousand bucks. Not much, for sure. Many people get even less. But notice that medicine and school/university is free, also all the prices are lower than they are in other countries. You can rent a good flat near the metro station for like 25-30k rubles, which is really not much I'd you are doing it with a roommate. 
But talking Moscow, many people get 60-100k+ rubles a month working for big companies like Gasprom or even some international companies. It really depends on who you are working for and for how long."

Like, really common. And there is even some kind of etiquette that you should give a cigarette to anyone who asks you (if they're polite ofc) because in that case you help someone and basically you deserve to be helped when you want to smoke but don't have anything and have to ask strangers.

I freak out and do not answer. After that, 20 minutes later, I am peaking as f. Me and my friend are sitting at his balcony, I am smoking my cigarettes, my friend is eating some chips.

So yeah, I answer and while I grab the phone I just make the alibi - we're playing Munchkin and drinking some tea at my friend's kitchen. So I tell her that and she was like ""Okay. Good night"". Well.

but once policemen asked me if i took any drugs, because my pupils were damn HUGE. and they also get bigger after i smoke cigarettes for some reason. but they just let me go after checking if my pupils get smaller after checking them with a phone light. 
nevertheless, teenagers still have fun strolling and just walking around at night, because even cops don't care about that law much."
