InsecureHBO,fpgpykf,t3_gcxieo,1588607390.0,"There is absolutely no way that Condola (Condensation) is pregnant with Lawrence's baby.  I think that Condola is not on Lawrence's level and what I mean by that is she would be the Beyonce in this scenario (Let me Upgrade you).  Lawrence is JUST getting his shit together, he just got an apartment after staying on  Chad's couch for some time and bumming on his girlfriend for 5 years, he didn't just magically deserve a woman who has her shit together and KNOWS what she wants.  Lawrence and Issa are totally on the same level, still on the come up trying to make it in their industry/career.  The determining factor for Lawrence in even deciding to date Condola was when he met up with his dad at the airport or for lunch in the last season and he was telling his father (sexy as hell by the way) that a lot of women come with baggage which is why Condola alluded to him being apprehensive about dating her to begin with because she was divorced.  Also when they were at that outdoor movie (Issa's birthday) he got turned off by Issa not having her shit together and she at that moment decided she did not want to do the block party because it was a lot to contend with (permits, liquor licenses, headliners, etc).  In that instance Condola was very sexy to him because she had her shit together.  Now Lawrence was just hit with a brick of reality by Condola (would he REALLY be broken up with Issa if she didn't cheat)?!  He hasn't even considered this and was projecting when asking Condola if she was over her ex-husband of a year and a half ago...that was PURE FUCKING PROJECTION on his part.  

There is no way that Condola is pregnant, I don't think that he and her are broken up but I think that he still has a lot to think about.
