sadcringe,f3si8xx,t3_dhohmd,1571103269.0,"I had a needy, insecure ex-gf and constantly need affirmation from me. Not only she wanted it every day, she wanted it on my whole waking seconds. She will take offend of everything I do or say about her. I had to tip toeing my words and actions towards her.  I'm with her every day and gave her everything but apparently it's never enough. She would get angry, throwing tantrum, screaming, and being extremely emotional because she misses me so much just because I took a few hours of going to bed early so I could go to the gym the next day. But I was with her whole day every day. I called her up in the morning accompanying her commute to work. Texting during work. Call after work to accompany her commute home. Call or video call late at night until 12am+. Every day I must say ""I miss you, I love you"". She made it it's a requirement for me to say it every day. Like wtf? I should be saying those words when I truly feel it, not because it's a requirement. And that does not mean that I don't love or miss her. Like fuck, man. It is extremely tiresome and mentally exhausting to be with someone like that.  Just because you are kind and loving, that doesn't give you the right to be so needy, clingy, and overly attached. And when the other person had enough of that, you don't get to guilt tripping them and gaslighting them into believing that they're a piece of shit because fuck you, I tried!"

Needafriend,euz2h3a,t3_chk4hf,1564112212.0,"I'm seriously puzzled by this. I have a few female friends like this. Despite being lied to, cheated on, emotionally abused multiple times, they still went back to their boyfriend. Like... Why? I got together with my best friend of 7 years after she broke up with her lying, cheating boyfriend. After a month in, she cheated on me with the same ex and I guess they are still together now. I considered her as my best friend but not only she cheated me on, she also doesn't respect me as a friend. So I walked out and haven't contact her since.

Just to be clear, if she needed me, I'll always be there for her as a friend. She was my best friend and I deeply cared about her. She doesn't need to lure me into a relationship, declared her love to me and give me hope."

It's not easy but you gotta do it for your girlfriend because chances are, she trusts and have faith in you a lot. Although not completely the same, I understand how you feel. Back when I was in uni, one of my closest girl friend told me she was molested by her teacher when she was a kid. Then she was raped when she was a teenager. She didn't report any of them because she doesn't to be shamed. When I listened to her stories, I was completely livid. I was so angry. Every time I see or heard news about rape made me see red after that.

All I can say is, always try to protect her but never fail to be strong for her. I'm sure she needs you more than you realized."

If people can't empathize with you or with the issues that you are dealing with, it's on them. Not you. Don't let yourself be needing the validation of others in order to validate yourself.

Try to find a way to make yourself feel better for yourself. Don't put any external reason on why you want to feel or be better. It has to be internal reasoning. It's not your job to make other people happy but it is 100% your job to make yourself happy. Don't reduce your happiness with something short term. You need to find something long term, do it regularly, and sustain it.

Physical movement and exercises is often always the best way to improve your mental health but find enjoyment in it. Don't move just for movement sake. Don't exercise just for exercise sake. Find enjoyment in them."
