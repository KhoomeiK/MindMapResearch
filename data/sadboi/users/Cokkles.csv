If the expectation of a anti-cheat being ""good"" is based on a 100% success rate in preventing all cheaters.  Then I'd hate to say that we have a lot of real life things that apparently aren't good enough (i.e. Vaccines) since they don't have a 100% effective rate."

Paid sick leave may be different, but it's the same argument used towards minimum wage increases.  ""Small businesses will crumble with minimum wage increases"".  This would indicate that the business was already barely afloat and would simply attribute to the idea of capitalism. The business was failing or on the verge of failure, not being able to accommodate employees reasonably isn't exactly an excuse to not do it because your business is bordering on failure.

I do get your point though, but we do need to consider how coddling failing small businesses by avoiding providing sick leave (Which is unavoidable and everyone goes through) or providing reasonable minimum wages is just a way of smaller companies to avoid their fate in Capitalism which is failure.

 `a political and economic theory of social organization which advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole.` 

Their idea is that people are advocating for an entire system of production that is managed solely by the government (or community) at the economic level.  But that's not what is being proposed.  We are a Democratic Republic with a Capitalist economical structure and we already have social policies in place.  Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, EBT, Unemployment benefits.  These are all ""socialist"" programs that are managed by the government with taxes overall.  Other 1st world countries are similar in nature.  Denmark, Sweden etc, are all Capitalist economies just with strong social policies for healthcare and education which breeds a stronger economy and a better overall quality of life for everyone.  It's not perfect or infallible, but it's way better than the shenanigans we deal with now with higher education and definitely healthcare.

insanepeoplefacebook,fgnk9ah,t1_fgncthc,1580946611.0,"I can respect that, but the way to look at it is like this..

Insane people post things normally

Political season comes with the upcoming presidential elections and the same mostly insane people post about politics.  While it can be a bit annoying if you wish to avoid the political dissidence.  It's part of the insanity.

But in reality, Politics itself has been insanity for a long time."
insanepeoplefacebook,fgnk0qx,t1_fgnffxf,1580946470.0,But.. you just said his children being president which would be a weird nepotistic oligarchy.  Kind of weird calling someone lost when you just described the exact thing he said.

insaneparents,fg0iftf,t1_fg0eauv,1580408448.0,"Legal guardianship. Child is a minor. That's the simple of it as there is state and federal regulations about confidentiality that is different when the person is a minor.

Not necessarily a perfect source but the below article sums it up. Some therapists are more protective of their minor patients information.

insaneparents,fg0dqye,t1_fg0bdpc,1580405660.0,Technically a parent can request the information from the therapist and the parent has the right to know.  It honestly defeats the purpose of therapy.

I'm married and the wife and I take turns getting solo time away from each other and parenting. Totally healthy."
insaneparents,febprgz,t1_fdnlhs7,1578961345.0,"Not adopted but my mother abandoned me when I was a baby.  She shows back up when I'm 19 offering for me to meet my family.  She played the ""I'm still your mother"" card and it irked me badly.  Have kept very low contact with her or my half siblings.  My half siblings are upset that I do not want to be around the biological mother who abandoned me.  
Another interesting tidbit is how my biological mother shows up and has attempted to convince me that her not being in a life was a result of my grandparents and my father.  Not the fact that she ran off with another woman to Florida and left her six month old in another state for multiple months.  
Trust me, you probably made the right choice."

titanfall,fd4wome,t1_fd4v9mh,1578171764.0,"Mozambique + Extended mag. Always lead targets and don't hesitate for long range shots. That thing has spread and 2 or 3 well placed shots will catch people even at longer ranges. Also run a P2016 as you can sneak away with kills after damaging someone with the primary 

Mastiff is trickier, but is much more solid at close range as it's essentially an insta kill. Just need to remember that it has horizontal spread. Also it's reload time sucks."

titanfall,fd4typ4,t1_fd4q5z5,1578171086.0,That's honestly why the CAR is considered such a strong weapon. Even when the SMG damage drop off at range the weapon has such an insane fire rate that it doesn't matter with no recoil
titanfall,fd4kzb6,t1_fd2yxsx,1578168545.0,To add to this. Titanfall was still a younger series and the 2nd game got sandwiched between major releases that already had brand name hype. This would definitely kill initial sales.

titanfall,fd3s0in,t3_ejzjun,1578161176.0,I'd say Spitfire or CAR would fit the last panel. The CAR just has no recoil. It's insane.
