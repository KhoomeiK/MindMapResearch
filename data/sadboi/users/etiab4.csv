AskWomen,fcuqfkm,t3_eiy8mb,1577986413.0,"I‚Äôm still figuring it out! I‚Äôm only 25 so bear with me here. 
Growing up my family was pretty dysfunctional. My Dad is very sexist and my mom suffers from mental health issues. I have 2 older brothers, we all have the same dad. They are still together and it was a middle-upper class household. My Dad with his sexist ways focused on raising my brothers with stereotypical manly things and I would be excluded, when I tried doing what they were doing/learning my dad made fun of me and said this is not feminine. Raising me to do girl things was no means a priority for him. So then there‚Äôs my mother who is a materialistic narcissist, she did not encourage any of the skills or dreams I had. I was forced to learn how to cook because I was female and how I should submit to a man and how I should continue to do female things. My family has also been very wishy washy about race. I grew up an hour away from Baltimore and my cousins were your stereotypical lower income black family. So when we got bad grades my dad would drive us through Baltimore city pointing out this is what will happen to me if I did not do well in education and most the people he was making an example of were Black. So being raised this type of way has lead me into going to a super white college and dating white. I hated myself for being Black and feared becoming a stereotype. I did not want to befriend black women or even look at black men. Looking at myself and other black people hurt because it was ingrained that being black is bad. I haven‚Äôt overcome this fully, I still prefer to date white but I don‚Äôt hate myself of my blackness I follow strong black women that remind me That I‚Äôm wrong. 
I can go on and on but I don‚Äôt want this to be TLDR
But 
TLDR: Follow strong black women."

But please report everything and I would break this to your daughter in maybe in a specialist office.
