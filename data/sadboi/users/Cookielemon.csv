AsianParentStories,fq1vkzo,t3_ggi8z8,1589049993.0,"I am not Asian, but I have said this exact thing to my therapist. Every single day my mom reminded me of the worse case scenario of EVERYTHING. 

My teachers didn't put my grades on the the internet parent portal(even though they were recorded in the paper grade book and that's the official copy) = the teacher thinks you didn't do any of your assignments and you are going to fail. 

Every single time there was a news story about kid that got kidnapped/murdered she always told me all the graphic details. 

Call out of work because I am sick = you are going to get fired for being lazy and lying..
I also wasn't ever allowed to be sick in school. I stopped asking her to let me stay home and sometimes the teachers would call and make her let me leave. 

Once I went to the beach with my friends and bf. She told me a story about a couple that got kidnapped and tortured while they were on a trip to the beach. 

If I wanted to stay at a friend's house for the weekend = they don't want you there and they are just being polite. You are imposing. 

I, as a completely independent adult, made the decision to move to another state because my husband got a good job offer = you guys don't know the cost of living. It's going to be too expensive and you guys will lose everything. 

Those are just the things that stick out in my mind. She also randomly decided that I wasn't allowed to walk down the street or ride my bike around my neighborhood because It was dangerous. Now me and my brother are both nervous wrecks. I immediately jump to worse case scenario. My boss doesn't tell me good morning, he must hate me and I'm getting fired. my professor didn't put my grades in, I made a zero on all my assignments and I am going to have to drop out of college. I think most people I interact with are secretly harboring a hatred towards me. my mom definitely instilled those fears in me, and I catch myself doing it to people all the time. They are announcing good news and I have to stop myself from chiming in and telling them everything that could go wrong. 

Sorry for the book, this subject has been weighing heavy on me today. I know how you feel and therapy has helped me a lot with what fears are rational and what aren't. Someone also told me that 80% of the things you worry about don't happen. So that is a mantra I repeat when my mind becomes overwhelmed with anxious thoughts."

I'm glad you at least helped her get to an ambulance. Even if it was at your own expense.

When he told me he didn't like fighting her for space I got her a memory foam bed and an outdoor/cooling bed thing that kind of works as a bed frame. So she has a nice place to sleep that is raised off the floor. And I put it right next to my side so she is close to me. She gets up in the bed after he leaves for work, which I don't mind because she is warm. I don't think she minds sleeping in her own bed because my husband is a kicker. She leaves the bed without having to be asked.

We also got a new dog together that we only allow on the bed rarely(due to some house training accidents) and she is very smart and caught on quickly  to get down when we tell her. She sleeps in her kennel without being told to. 

The dog might enjoy having a space that belongs to her. Getting her a nice bed might make OP's bf feel better about kicking her out. My dogs know they have their own places to go lay down or relax and I think that helps keep the house calm."

I asked and she said ""Colby is already in the bathroom. Wait until he gets back."" I said ""he never comes back."" she said "" well you need to talk to him about that then.""

Pets,fnwjxhs,t1_fnv28up,1587319804.0,"One of my coworkers came into my office and told me her dog had an abscess tooth and was basically starving itself to death. She said her kids and husband were begging to take it to the vet and she kept saying ""it's just a dog. I have had so many dogs and farm animals we never had to take them to the vet."" She ended up getting it fixed and then a few months later her son needed braces and she kept telling her husband how stupid he was for spending that money on the dog. 

It made me sick. People like that should not have animals."
niceguys,fntfg4n,t1_fnssew7,1587240580.0,"Omg
The first thing my ex did when we got together was start going through all my clothes and making me throw out things that made me look ""immature"" or slutty. Then he made me get rid of all my beer glasses from breweries I had visited because they were ""childish"". Then he threw out my silverware that I got for a steal at a resale shop because it was ""covered in germs"". He did all that while I was watching. While I wasn't watching, he threw out things I kept from childhood. Notes from people I went to school with, journals, and photos. 

He then proceeds to fill my house with useless junk. 100s of DVDs. That he bought from a 5$ bin. His mom's old clothing I didn't want or fit in. He hoarded old school books he found at Goodwill that he never read. He bought antique dishes and pots and pans we didn't need. He got me new silverware that you couldn't put in a dish washer that rusted. He never complained about them being covered in germs. He even brought home a tacky ass beer glass that said Guinness. I fucking hate Guinness. 

As soon as he left I got rid of everything that reminded me of him. I felt so much better just having my own stuff and my own space.

 Also he did all this when he didn't even live with me."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fnrjltf,t3_g2po0e,1587191003.0,I also loved how everyone he would speak to would react the same way. They would get this confused look on their face then rephrase the question they were asking. Then he would start doing it again and they would just nod.
Herpes,fnreo5t,t3_g3fbh1,1587186702.0,"If you just came out and told him instead of just breaking it off with him you would not be left wondering what could have been. 
If he is an ass about it then you have your answer. Why prolong the inevitable?
It will hurt if he rejects you ,but at least you will be a able to shut the book on that chapter of your life for good and start to heal. 

TBH from the way you have described how he treated you in the past, he sounds like an asshole, but IDK a lot about your relationship so I won't tell you what to do. 

You deserve to be happy and not crying over anyone. I wish you the best."
Showerthoughts,fnrdikb,t1_fnqracm,1587185757.0,Read 'I'll be gone in the dark' by Michelle McNamara and then tell me that your own home isn't scary at night.
BreakUps,fnrcini,t3_g3dqhz,1587184958.0,"My stupid ex tried to contact me to apologize. After I told him he had no clue what he even did and how much he had cost me (mentally and money wise because I had to get lots of therapy), he blew up because I didn't accept his hallow apology. He went from telling he loves me 1 second to berating me and telling me that it was all my fault that he had been so abusive. I told him that this type of behavior was the reason the relationship ended and not to contact me for any reason in the future. 
He texted me twice more after that pretending like he didn't know whose number it was. 

Just do all your exes a giant favor and leave them alone. Is the apology for them or is it for you to make yourself feel better? texting someone who is in pain reminding them of how fucked up you were to them isn't going to help that person."

Herpes,fnqmzb8,t3_g3cr6j,1587167878.0,TBH it looks like some kind of bites or maybe poison oak even. Have you been outside in tall grass recently? I would go to a Dr. They will probably give you some kind of topical steroid.
insaneparents,fnqlu2z,t1_fnpqtci,1587167209.0,What's insane is letting this happen and posting it on IG for the world to judge your questionable parenting.
depression,fnq7bve,t1_fnoniq4,1587159069.0,"I think part of that ""fog"" for me is comparing myself to others and not thinking I'm good enough. I have a degree that I was once happy with and very interested in, but now I am not so sure about working in that field for the rest of my life. We need to cut ourselves a little slack. We do not have to be the best ever to live fulfilling a meaningful lives. You are allowed to work a job that you are comfortable with and janitorial work is important. I quite enjoy cleaning. It's very satisfying. maybe you will change your mind or come across some other opportunity that makes you happy in the future, but let it happen when it happens. If it doesn't that is ok too. Don't sit there and beat yourself up about what you should, could or would have done. Just do what you can handle and celebrate every step forward no matter how small. Think about the moment you're in. Appreciate the stillness, the calm, the people in your life that you love and feel the sun on your skin. That is the essence of being alive on this Earth. There is no need to impose more stress on yourself. 

I hope you feel better ❤️"
AmItheAsshole,fnpvmhk,t1_fnpk8tq,1587152819.0,Also I would be quite upset if someone from my ex's family was trying to add me on FB just to be nosey.
AmItheAsshole,fnpo00e,t1_fnoyu5y,1587148864.0,My aunt's ex husband and his wife weren't allowed to  talk bad about her and my cousin's other sisters that chose not to have a relationship with them per the custody agreement. It would probably be best for her to approach a lawyer about amending the agreement to include something like that.

relationships,fnpf3rz,t1_fnoq0tv,1587144399.0,"Holy shit this... I used to really enjoy going out to eat by myself. Because I didn't have to deal with anyone judging what I got to eat, how much I spent, how many drinks I got. I had to lie to my ex about it because he would accuse me of being on a date, drinking too much, ask for my receipt and hound me about how I spent my money. 

Now I don't have to lie. my husband always wants to go with me when I say I'm craving something and want to go out. I still feel like I have to ask him if it's ok that I get something I want. He just laughs and tells me ""girl get whatever you want."" He never examines my receipts or asks me why I am dressed nice or wearing makeup to impress everyone else. It's so refreshing. I don't crave that alone time like I used to because we actually have fun together."

stopdrinking,fnn3jhf,t3_g2pypi,1587083644.0,"I was thinking about this today. I don't want to say I can't drink because it makes me feel like I'm missing out. Even though I know I am not. 
I would rather say I don't drink because I am choosing not to subject myself to all the negativity that comes with it."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fnle2pn,t1_fnldhir,1587051926.0,"Looking back on things that makes sense. She is picking the relationship apart from the get go. I feel like when she said her heart wasn't in it that would have been devastating for me and make me not want to continue in the relationship. She obviously likes Derrek or at least she did on the honey moon, but the ""passion"" wasn't comparable to the relationship with her ex."
MarriedAtFirstSight,fnlc56e,t1_fnkyujd,1587050927.0,"It killed me that he still refused to admit he was a liar. He kept saying he was ""accountable"" for his actions over and over again. Just repeating something to the point that you believe it doesn't make it true."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fnivpud,t3_g1u8dg,1586987197.0,"I have always had anxiety. In the fifth grade, I  had a journal that we had to write in every day as a warm up assignment. The next day after it was checked and graded, I would rip the pages from the journal and throw them away. I was afraid to read my own writing and I didn't want anyone else reading it out of embarrassment. I would kill to have those journals today, but I would probably still be too embarrassed to ever post it online."
insaneparents,fnit747,t3_g0pwsu,1586985937.0,"This reminds me of a time when It was especially hot  one night, so I had slept on the couch where the air circulation was better. my mom used to wake up at 5 am to get ready for work. She then proceeds to spend an hour stomping around on the hard wood floors with her heels on. I got up as she was leaving and asked her why she didn't put her shoes on beside the front door. She got really angry at me for wanting to sleep in and told me it was the rudest thing she has ever heard and that I need to stop staying up so late playing video games. Then I won't need to sleep all day ."
DecidingToBeBetter,fnihd5n,t3_g1xlm5,1586980017.0,"I used to have this problem. I loved arguing with people. I had to  deactivate my Facebook account for a couple months and when I got back on I left the groups I was in because of the tendency for everyone to dog pile on one person for saying something ignorant or stating am unpopular opinion. 
It made me angry and put me in a bad mood."
aww,fniftrn,t1_fnh7w7q,1586979268.0,Why do some dogs look at what's on screen and some don't? My German Shepard mix will literally watch the TV while I am and move around to get a better view. My boxer mix has never looked at the TV and when I show her my husband on FaceTime she looks past the phone and only seems to respond to him speaking. She will then go around the house looking for him.

JustNoSO,fmq05mz,t1_fkvj82w,1586290480.0,"Girl , I knew I was in trouble when my ex SO said we should have the same bank acc. And started wanting to keep tabs on everything I spent like it was his money. I was already making plans on how I would keep some of my money to myself so I could go out to eat or get a drink every once in a while without him losing his mind. 

He mentioned wanting to get married and I had the sense to tell him i wasn't sure if I wanted that and our relationship fizzled out shortly after. 

I still have issues around spending money and thinking I have to ask my husband if he would get mad if I got something small for myself."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fmpkpio,t3_ftg2kg,1586282554.0,My husband told me when he was a child he had a dog that would pee in the floor sometimes. So he decided he would try it and didn't think it was that fun after.
