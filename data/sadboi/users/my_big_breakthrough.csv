MadeOfStyrofoam,fm9j309,t3_fttuew,1585869765.0,"Damn dude, that proper sucks. To give your dad his due, he is probably scared about what you're going through, and that will make parents do strange things. That being said, the way he handled it was totally wrong and I'm sorry you had to go through it.  

Reaching out for help isn't weak, it's a sign of emotional strength. If your mum is close enough and good to talk to about these things, explain to her what your dad did and how it made you feel. She will have the best advice as to what to do next, and most likely will be able broach the topic to your dad in a way that will make him listen. 

It might be the case that he actually didn't know what he caused - ignorance about mental illness is common - or it might be that that's how he really feels. If it's the former, then it's quite likely that he will realise what he did was wrong and become more supportive in the process. If it's the latter, then at least both you and your mother know that for sure, and can formulate the best plan going forward. Your father isn't necessarily entitled to your private information like that. 

I wish you all the best :)"

So many of us are living examples of that. 

Please don't use this as an excuse to do it more, i know i would've when i was still held in its grip. Don't feel the need to prove to him that he was wrong. Your self harm is valid and I know you will have your many reasons for it. Stay safe"

BipolarReddit,fjcs5wp,t1_fjc9oho,1583234491.0,"A lot of mental illnesses can be wrapped up in Bipolar. OCD-like tendencies can be found a lot in manic episodes, especially if they are towards the more extreme end (it sounds like it's not in your case), and ADHD symptoms are classic of hypo/mania restlessness. 

Like the above, depression is often a misdiagnosis of bipolar. It's the other half of the spectrum we go through. 

So yeah, it sounds pretty possible to me. If you do have Bipolar, making sure not to be on SSRIs and getting on mood stabilisers usually works wonders."

Ups, downs, spending all my money, cutting myself daily. A roller coaster. And now that school is out for me, half of my support friends have moved away. 

Make the most of being young, and I'm saying that as someone only slightly older than you. There's plenty of time to be depressed when you're older. 

Make sure your friendships are well rooted. Your friends are the people that genuinely want the best for you. Find those people and spend as much time with  them as you can. When push comes to shove, the fake friends will melt away, and if you haven't taken the time to make real relationships with people you can lean on, you'll be left alone.

Where you live, are there benefits for people with mental illnesses? If you have a diagnosis in writing, quite often you can get some money for it. 

You aren't alone! In fact, close to 90% of people with severe (and BP is counted as severe) mental illnesses are unemployed. For BP specifically, I think it's around 60%. That's not a death sentence - it's saying to you that you are by no means alone. Your struggle is valid. Comparing yourself to others is a surefire way to get depressed. They haven't had to face the same obstacles as you. You've got to take a little bit of pity on yourself. 

That's pretty close to what my psychiatrist said to me, and I basically thought ""yeah right"". But, it's true, to some extent. I know that we are not traditionally pity-seekers, but sometimes you need to recognise that it's okay you're struggling. 

It's not because you're a bad person. You'll do bad stuff, make dumb mistakes, and all of that is gonna be made worse by the illness.

Doesn't mean you are worth less than any other person, and it certainly doesn't mean you can't improve from your current situation"

There is a lot of nuance. I think it's also probably true that while suicidal, some people may just let go from any resistance, and so if someone else initiates sex they might not be in the mind to say no, and so the other person could just keep going. That would be more like not consenting but letting it happen.
