And I think if you thought not pursuing a masters was the best decision then I trust that it was!  This is just one example of you and your bf so if he is constantly acknowledging other people‚Äôs positive aspects and rarely yours, it also makes sense that you would feel less than.

I think any kind of fertility or surrogacy should be completely legal and I understand that sometimes people just want a bio kid, I just hate when people don‚Äôt even consider adopt for the reason of not wanting a child that‚Äôs ‚Äúnot really theirs‚Äù.

It‚Äôs like they think that a ‚Äúclean slate‚Äù means they can control having a perfect life when that‚Äôs literally never guaranteed for anyone so like I kinda feel like if they‚Äôre not ready to handle issues in an adopted child then how are they going to hand the issues with their own?  Like it just feels too much like parents are supposed to be molding their children to be perfect and that‚Äôs just not how life works.

I think surrogacy should be legal but I think it needs to be more known that it‚Äôs still a health risk to the other woman even when she‚Äôs willing to do it"
