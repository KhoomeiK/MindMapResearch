BPD,fr4xsv1,t3_gmc42c,1589898900.0,"I so feel this! It was okay when I was in lockdown as I didn‚Äôt have to think of excuses when things got too much which has been a lot lately with a lot of shit happening in the family and being in the vulnerable group. 
But nope I need to be back out and back at life too. Not all public transport is back either so everything is taking so much longer and I‚Äôm run I key shaking with anxiety trying to o fight of a panic attack waiting for my second bus right now"
BPD,fqug8lg,t3_gktze3,1589658458.0,"Self sabotage is such a skill of mine I‚Äôve even started doing it in my sleep (god I wish that was a joke) but yeah I totally feel you! I find if it doesn‚Äôt cause a break up it will cause arguments and then eventually they get sick of those too. Or I feel like if I say anything then we‚Äôll argue and they‚Äôll break up with me so I end up never sticking up for myself or setting boundaries which isn‚Äôt a healthy way to go either üò´

LifeProTips,fll0a8t,t3_fpfwra,1585251195.0,"One thing I will be forever grateful of my parents for. Is instilling a love of books in me. It wasn‚Äôt easy for them. I was late diagnosed with dyslexia and up until late primary school was very behind in English and the schools reading plan. My parents were good and listened to me when I said I didn‚Äôt find the books interesting and bought me a wide range for me to find what interested me. Be the time it came to sit an entrance exam at a for the secondary level private school I was awarded a 50% scholarship for maths, English and art and went on to do English language and literature at A level and loved them. I still read daily and never have less than 3 books on the go and now even have two full book cases I‚Äôve inherited from my parents including a leather bound Dickens collection that means everything to me"

raisedbybipolar,fg0amjz,t3_evpg8y,1580403775.0,"My Bipolar mum died over 2 years ago. I moved out to live on my own in a shitty little flat 18 months ago. And I still struggle sleeping on my own. But it is getting better. 
Therapy to help treat my PTSD from being a Carer has worked wonders but I still jump into panic mode the second anything goes wrong. Keep going. You can do this!"
UnsentLetters,ffcxaze,t3_eir9ku,1579809202.0,"This reminds me so much of when I was caring for my mum. The chemo would ruin her and the nausea was so bad she could barely eat anything. But if I rolled her a spliff it would subside and she would be able to eat and sleep. I even remember sneaking her out of the care home for a quick smoke on the nights where I would sleep in the chair because she was too scared to be alone. It may not be legal in the UK but I‚Äôll be damned if I would let that stop me from providing a very rare comfort for my mum! 
Much love and empathy to you! I‚Äôll light up in your dads honour!"

BPD,ff303rl,t3_edv9ai,1579530053.0,This is a daily feeling for me. But definitely one I struggle with. Especially after loosing both of my parents to ill health. In my teen years I attempted suicide many times. Clearly with no luck and I think this is when this kind of ideation started. Since than I have developed chronic if not life threatening health issues and part of me feels I deserve it and hey maybe all the medication with help break my body some more and reduce my time here.
BPD,ff2xvxc,t3_eqbj0k,1579528116.0,I had assumed I felt this way due to my history of abuse. And was always confused as to why my brother could never understand when I would explain to him how sometimes even just tone of voice can change something from a well meaning comment. To a condescending ridicule. In the time it took to go from his lips to my ears. Knowing that is may be more due to my BPD than PTSD helps a lot. Thank you!
