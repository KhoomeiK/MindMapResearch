The appointment had been scheduled for a whole two weeks and I could have called it off (I didn't because that would have been cruel to my dog), but it didn't really feel permanent until they knocked on the door."

socialskills,fqmsm53,t1_fql6t1y,1589482842.0,"Sure! For example, my partner has a friend that loves extreme sports. His friend often tricks other friends into committing to participate in these events without knowing the full extent of the event, but then doing it anyway because they feel guilty if they change their mind about doing it.

The other day my partner's friend kept talking about an event that was coming up as if my partner had already agreed to participate in it. When my partner noticed his friends saying things like, ""WE are going to do this"" and ""WE will arrive there at this time"" my partner simply said, ""There is no WE in this. YOU can go do that thing and I'll meet you for a beer afterwards, but I am not going to participate"" and that shut it down immediately.

My partner says it's important to be firm in how you feel about something and not to leave room for doubt because people will work their way into pushing your boundaries. When you hear someone mentioning something that crosses your boundary, be upfront about it and hold your boundary."
socialskills,fqjb1dq,t3_gj44sf,1589407457.0,"My partner is SO GOOD at setting boundaries. I always observe with amazement every time it happens.

I think it's a mix of knowing exactly what your boundary is, speaking it confidently at the first sign of someone trying to cross your boundary, and saying it in a matter-of-fact why that conveys that nothing anyone says is going to shift your boundary.

I'm not good at it yet, but I'll keep taking notes and watching my partner and maybe one day I can achieve that level of ""IDGAF about what you think of my boundaries."""
socialskills,fq1fk10,t3_ggdopj,1589045205.0,"Fellow quiet introvert here. They do that because some people get uneasy when they don't know exactly what you're thinking, but they have no social skills of their own to guide a conversation to discover what they want to know. They just want you to ramble like they do.

""You're so quiet! Can you even talk!?"" 

""Yes I am. And yeah, I just choose not to.""

You don't have to give up your boundaries just because others are uncomfortable. I've become quite fond of the power of being quiet. :)"

Instead of hearing all the noise around me, I can only hear my breathing and that helps me relax a lot."
