Tell the police and make a report, see a lawyer to find out if its enough for a restraining order or at the very least a cease and desist. Tell any relatives and friends you have what is being done to you.

Final step is to get yourself somewhere safe. Pack your bags and if family and friends can't let you stay, please try and find a women's shelter, a domestic violence shelter will be safest. The police should be able to help you find a good place.

And please don't consider any other act other than getting him away from you. I get you may love him, but I'm sorry to say, he does NOT love you. He reminds me of a sociopath tbh. You will never be able to have a loving happy life with this man no matter what he promises you.

Also, why in heck did she not just ask you to find this necklace? I think she wanted something else and that's why she waited to know you were gone.

You did the right thing by reclaiming your key. I do suggest changing front and back door locks just in case she made a copy. Also cameras are super cheap now, I have some from Wyze that I paid like $40 CAD each. They have motion sensors, night vision etc. They have doorbell cameras too I believe. This protects you from any more privacy issues. It will also help if she tries to tell people you're being abused, since she won't shut up about it.

Until this person gives you a sincere apology for doing what she did and then having the gall to bring up your intimacy interests, please keep your distance. She has proven not to be trustworthy and I'd even go so far as to say she is a potential danger to you as something about her behavior doesn't sit right. Take care if yourself.

Separate all your finances from his. Get a bank safe deposit box and put in all your important papers, jewelry, small electronics, money and anything you deem important. Make it a bank separate from one good normally use.
The day of his eviction, change the locks before he gets home and install some cameras. One by the front door and a few in the house. Have the police pre dialled onto your phone. Be prepared for a whole lot of ruckus from him and his family, keep tight records and report to police if needed. They will probably go extinction level crazy once the jig is up and they don't have access to abuse you or have you believe their lies, especially husbands.
It is always safer to not have an in person confrontation when breaking up with someone who is a potential threat. Pack his bags and leave them outside your freshly changed door locks. Have a family member or close friend with you inside. Give your lawyers info and he can contact you from there.

And

""Don't let someone dim your light, simply because it's shining in their eyes.""

And yes it's up to your parents to make the rules in the house while she lives there. But if she encroaches on your space, like she tries to do with your study room, then you have the right to say no.

It's also not your job to have to be constantly nice to her. It won't matter in the end because she has determined that she's the victim and you are her problem, when you've done nothing to her. Be civil, but don't allow her to walk all over you.

As for her pushing you to have kids. That's her envy talking. She sees how much freedom you have and she envies you for it. 

Plus you're going further into your education at a much younger age than her and she doesn't like the praise you get for it. Why else does she need to pipe in that you're 22 now? Shes trying to dull the shine of your accomplishment, and to be honest that's kinda sickening, and I totally get your frustration. 

Lastly, the two of you went on different journeys with your education paths. Its sounds like she was paying a lot of attention to her relationship and not as much on school. Where as you have put your nose to the grindstone AND you still work part time. I'm sure your parent understand and notice this, which is why you're not expected to work full time, especially as you commute to school. Sounds like you're handling your business and your parents approve.

Try not to let her immature behavior and tantrums bother you. Maybe make an effort to not let her get under your skin if possible, so as to not have arguments that affect you negatively. Put locks on your bedroom and study room with your parents approval so you have safe spaces to get away from her. 
I'm sorry you are so frustrated and I hope you're able to get through the rest of this time living in the same house. And keep up all the good work with school!"

 I would pay pretty much anything to get off the narcotics and be able to use CBD instead. Unfortunately it doesn't work for me.
But I would absolutely have a big problem if my husband had a migraine and stole my pills. And if he continued to steal them because it made him ""feel good,"" his ass would be out on the streets.
Also, if what I read in the comments about a family member of yours being sick with the virus is true, you won't be allowed back for pretty much the rest of the lockdown.
So congrats bud, your stupidity and stubbornness just screwed her over again.

100% tell all your guest his MIL stole all the gifts. Thank them for thinking of you and say you would have loved whatever the got you. Tell them your SO has yet to cut the apron strings to his mommy and is refusing to get them back. Then hand him his divorce papers and in the divorce demand compensation for the stolen gifts. Because all the gifted money is gone too I'm guessing? Try and get a list from family and friends of what they gave you. This way you'll at least be able to tell a judge why you can't stay married to this man and how much his mom stole.
Also you have so many rights. Please speak with a lawyer immediately. (If there are female lawyers where you live, that may be best) Not only should you be compensated, but your family should be as well for all the money spent on the wedding itself. 
I wish you luck, and keep that spine shiny and strong. Be ready to assert yourself and don't let them treat you badly ever again. If they try and say mean things about you, simply say, ""at least I'm not a desperate thief, who steals from her own son and DIL,"" and walk away.

1.If you are on you parents phone plan, don't use it. Take out the SIM card and destroy it. Get yourself a new phone, new SIM. Because even if you transfer the SIM into a new phone she WILL be able to track you.
2.Go into your local police office. Tell them your basic info and explain your situation. Tell them what mom is like and say why you are leaving. Explain that most likely you mom will come in and say you've gone missing or that you've been kidnapped. Be very clear with the officer that while YOU are safe, she is NOT.
3.Make sure that all bank accounts are separate. I would even advise using a different bank than her so there are no ""accidental"" breaches of information. 
4.Use your passport to get a new SIN number, birth certificate, license etc. This way you don't have to deal with her and getting them back.
5.Have teachers, and any other professional adults to write letters saying that you're not mentally Ill in any way that's dangerous to yourself and others. If you already have a psychiatrist for your depression, a letter from them is best. With your moms history of controlling you, I wouldn't put it past her to try and have you ""committed"" which would put you back under her control. Leave copies with the police if possible for your file.
6.When you do your final escape, do a quick video on your phone and email it to yourself and your boyfriend and another friend. Video yourself with a quick rundown of why you're leaving, show the house  so they can't accuse you of theft or damage etc. This protects you from any accusations. 
7.Finally, please make sure that you take absolutely everything when you escape. If you want family pictures, get them then. Any belongings that are sentimental, have to do with school etc. Because there is no getting them later.
Also, and please don't forget this one. REDIRECT YOUR MAIL. This is extremely important and often forgotten. I wouldn't put it past her to illegally open your mail to try and find you, or withhold important paperwork from school, doctors, banks etc. Make sure you change all addresses as soon as possible, even with the redirect because they only last for a few months.

I am so very happy that you are getting close to freedom. Obviously be very careful of your health as well during this time. (Speaking of, make sure your fiance is your emergency contact on EVERYTHING, just in case) 
I know it's hard but try to act as normal as possible too. And hopefully knowing that your life is going to begin fresh, with the love of your life, will help your depression. But if it persists and you don't see anyone currently, please see someone soon so you can get the help you need.

Third off, you sound really brave and strong, but sometimes problems at your age are too big for us.

If you feel all alone, and that no one who is family or friend will help, reach out to a stranger in a safe, public manner. Write you and your sister names and ages, your address, your mothers name and a line of what you're afraid of. The next time you're at the shops or near someone you feel is safe, slip them the note. Make many of these notes so if one person does nothing, you give out another. (Make sure your mother does not see this, so she doesn't get angrier)

Good on you for standing up to her! Next time she brings the money up again, tell her that etiquette dictates that a gift is no longer her property and you are under no obligation to pay her back. Her tactic to get her own way blew up in her face. 
Another idea is to take the dress to the dress shop and ask if you can exchange it for a dress you actually like. Even if you don't find a wedding dress there, maybe get the bridesmaid dresses in exchange? Just an idea. If that doesn't work there's consignment shops or you could donate it to the charity Make a Wish? In case you want to get rid of the dress, you can still either feel good and donate it, or help you get something YOU DO want for your actual big day!
I'm so sorry your mom is being such a twat. Ignore her from here on out and I think it goes without saying but, please don't involve her in any way with your wedding moving forward. And password protect all your vendors, dress stores, literally everything to do with your big day.

We had been friends since age 12 and just last month I ""dumped"" her for good after her forgetting yet another birthday, and being horrible to me. When she was between wives she wanted a ton of my time and support and I actually brought up this topic and she admitted she does that and promised never again. Then she met her next wife and boom...I didn't exist again. Then four years back, she meets with me to tell me she doesn't want or need friends, (even though she has a ton of friends where she now lives) but I could stay in her life if I met her ""conditions."" Basically it was an I'll call you, you don't call me. I tried so hard to be patient and wait her out, but she called maybe once or twice a year if I was lucky. Every conversation was so one sided and if I dared ask to meet for coffee when she was in town, she would give me 10-15 minutes of her time and that's it. So I stopped caring. If my friendship and support isn't good enough for her, I wasnt going to keep feeling beat up by her. I wrote a long ass text and she said everything I said was true and she didn't care. 
Friendship of 25 years down the toilet.
...I am sorry for your pain in your own situation. When a friendship ends it's like loosing a boyfriend/ husband. You need to grieve the loss so you can move forward and have healthy relationships. It may be a good idea to tell your friend how you feel when she does this. How you won't put up with her pushing you away whenever its convenient to her. Respect goes two ways and she isn't respectful of you. I really hope things get better. I wish I hadn't wasted so many years waiting to be good enough for my ex friend. Good luck."

Not sure where you live but there are apps like meetup.com where you go to events you love with like minded people. There's board game groups, dinner groups and so many more. It's also something you and your wife could try doing together. (Obviously these will have to wait until it's safe to gather in groups again)
You've had a challenging life and an unsupportive family. Its beyond understandable to be depressed with the experiences you've had. But you now have a wife and have gotten rid of the toxicity you were putting up with. Give yourself a break for a bit. If you feel like just watching Netflix for 2 weeks straight and binge eating, do it! Ask your wife to join you when she can but if she's busy, just chill! Try to leave the guilt in the past. Let yourself just be. You should be so proud of how much you've overcome. I know that's hard and you've suffered a lot of loss, and I'm so very sorry about that. But you live with them in your heart, you remember and care for them. That's all you can do. 
So take a time out, let yourself be depressed in a ""safe"" way. If you need to get on anti depressants and have therapy then go for it. After you feel better I hope you can figure out what's next.

Honesty I would fire the employee as well for causing you to be uncomfortable going to your place of business. She had no right to gossip internally in your company.
