relationships,fr1ghbt,t3_glwmns,1589819309.0,"It’s kind of a lifesaver here that you kept it “no comment” and moved on. Hopefully your friends wouldn’t be so ready to make any concrete presumptions about Lola’s health let alone spread any news to others (I think [i hope] it’s a universally understood common courtesy that you don’t walk around telling people that someone has a disease)

As far as explaining that to Lola, it wouldn’t be very helpful even if the above is true and it ends up being not that big of a deal. It was an honest mistake that has now nudged her into the high- pressure decision making process of now figuring out what she wants to do. This may emotionally have been a dose of reality for her that’s now putting her in a pivotal place. However, you’ve apologized and that’s all you can do (not saying that that’s a bad thing), the best thing to do now is support her through her decision making if she needs you.

Edit: yes, damage control would be a good thing to offer up right now. if you’re friends are “showing support”, tell them they need to be mindful of Lola’s privacy and that she will let them know if she needs their advocacy"

femalefashionadvice,fqvleyi,t3_gkv2x8,1589679762.0,"I’ve been deliberately losing weight this year, but before then I’ve been a size 16 for my entire adult life, and pretty much have dressed this way since 2016 with no self questioning. I found myself liking the forgiving silhouettes of these items (high waisted, wide leg pants - chunky shoes to balance the appearance of my legs - long skirts - big sweaters - low shoulder jackets). If anything, I’ve come to associate this look with plus size women. 

I sympathize. I’ve felt so alienated by certain things (the line about heroin chic really hit home for me. absolutely not inclusive style, if anything it’s triggering how excluding it is). However, I objectively found most of the points being made in this article totally illogical... The fact that one of the highlighted quotes is “...a minimalist aesthetic is [...] implicitly fatphobic.” I found myself really frustrated with the totally weird implications made in this article. 

My experience with “dressing fat” has always been highly personal for me. Like a lot of us, I was forced into really narrow customization of what kinds of silhouettes and colors I could wear. When I liked a “look”, I’d do everything I could to make it work, and then new things would stick with me. I’ve always gotten stuff from goodwill and was not afraid to be completely objective about my opinions and feelings. I’m not saying this is superior or the best way to go about it, or anything... I’ve felt an excruciating amount of social exclusion and pain. I just, I don’t know. This struck me funny, as someone who has successfully dressed like present day Olsen twins / The Row for the last like, 5 years.

Also: the stylish/lazy dichotomy. A great example of this would be long cardigans."

realwitchcraft,fqnemg1,t3_gjsyfr,1589493477.0,"Rule number 1, use only unscented candles.

7 day candles have specific uses, I wouldnt use one unless you’re working a spell that calls for it. They’re used a lot in hoodoo, I can’t totally speak to it...

Otherwise, for more general candle magic, just use plain wax candles; what are called four inch “tapers” are most common in the practice of candle magic— but birthday candles work just as well, and you get several of every color in the same pack."

If you have someone fixated on your significant other, do a spell to drive them away, and a general love spell for that person to give them peace and protect your neck. It’s kind of a way of killing two birds with one stone: you give the third party the love they’re looking for and consequentially get to avoid any vindication that person might have cast if they became hurt, angry, whatever. I think it’s more of a strategy than an ethical thing. Also, I can’t really speak to it, but hexes are kind of intense and require some protection work along with them.

It’s an interesting case study. Even if you continue to work a honey jar on a long term partner, you’re just strengthening their goodwill towards you.

realwitchcraft,fpl9d9n,t3_gdvsmy,1588708668.0,"My opinion on free will is that it’s not really there, because any given choice that you make could have an infinite possible number of results, so how can you really “will” anything. If someone is under the influence of say, a love spell, or anything really, there is so much possibility in what they choose to do with those random and sudden feelings. All you’re really doing is dropping a line.
Most love spells seem to take effect if conjured right. Following what I described above, there is huge variety in how it manifests irl once you’ve brought that person to you (or back). You have to prep for reality, literally. 

I worked a love spell that I found online when I was like, 18. It totally worked. I had seen this guy around and was really into him, but we didn’t cross paths too too much. I got a fb message from him out of the blue after having never really talked before that said “hey! We should hang out sometime”. We dated for maybe a month and I broke up with him because he was too nervous to even kiss me and the whole thing was really confusing. So, in short, you can bring someone to you, but what happens after you have to ...think about. Which is worth the work if you really want an ex back or something. Don’t let the same problems happen over and over again, get yourself “right”, try to resolve old issues within yourself /irt your former relationship while you wait."
