AskReddit,fp15p9s,t3_gaepss,1588225126.0,"Drugs. They are the defining factor of my generation. Everything has been normalized. As a soon to be grad you wouldnâ€™t believe how easy it is to get ANYTHING  if you know the right people. Iâ€™ve witnessed kids do acid/shrooms in school (Iâ€™m guilty of the former) snort molly and adderall, smoke weed, cigs, but more than anything Iâ€™ve seen so many godforsaken carts, dab pens, and other vapes. Thereâ€™s been an interesting resurgence in psychedelics Iâ€™ve seen, while also less interest in harder drugs. But if I could say one thing besides drugs. Iâ€™d say the amount of kids dropping out to get GEDâ€™s. Shits pathetic."
