In terms of suggestions: 

First, talk to your mom. Let her know you are here to support her, not to judge her, and that you understand how difficult it is. If she is willing to be open and honest with you, then together you can think of a plan. She should probably join some kind of support group, and she will need medical care for withdrawals if she does decide to go clean. 

Also, you should look into getting her a medical marijuana card if it's legal in your state. It can be a good alternative to her pain medication, and can also help her get through the withdrawals."

Your daughter is 13. This diet was her idea, and you are supporting her, and that's a good thing. The problem is that, even though your daughter is on board, the body standards and pressure that young girls feel is really extreme, and as a parent, your primary job right now should be to make her feel comfortable with her body. She's a growing kid, and weight fluctuations and weight gain is extremely normal for that age. 

It's clear you just want to be a supportive parent. I was in your daughter's place when I was in middle school. My parents helped me with my diet just like you are doing for your daughter. But it took me years and some therapy to get rid of my obsessions about food and weight. I still have anxiety attacks if I gain weight. It is very difficult to have a kid diet without ingraining in them the idea that food is dangerous or bad or something they need to have tons of self control and be afraid around.

It's good that your daughter is trying to eat more healthily, but treat days are essential, not just for your physical health but also for your daughter's relationship with food and her body. She should be able to enjoy a restaurant meal at thirteen years old. Her mental health is a lot more important than her weight, and diets at such a young age can really impact the way she views eating for the rest of her life."

One of my favorite quotes that describe that feeling is from The Hours by Michael Cunningham, spoken by a character who is standing on a window ledge, about to jump off. This is the exchange he has with his friend. 

""I don't know if I can face this. You know. The party and the ceremony, and then the hour after that, and the hour after that.""

""You don't have to go to the party. You don't have to go to the ceremony. You don't have to do anything at all.""

""But there are still the hours, aren't there? One and then another, and you get through that one and then, my God, there's another. I'm so sick.""

That's how it feels. You look at your life, and at the challenges that lie ahead that seem too much to get through. But that's not where it gets bad. It gets bad when you think of the hours, all those endless hours of your life that you need to get through if you choose to live. So maybe you get through these challenges. Maybe you find a solution to your problems. But then there will be new problems, new hurts, new losses. So many hours. So much pain. And you just feel so tired, so tired of it all. 

It is the most imposible thing to do, except for living"
