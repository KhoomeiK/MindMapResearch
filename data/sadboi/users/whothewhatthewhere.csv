I monitor my hands and as soon as I see a bubble popping up, I apply the cream and it stops it from turning into a bigger patch, and so I’m able to keep my hands relatively eczema free. The cream is pretty harmless so based on my experience with it, I can say it would be worth giving it a try! However it is a little pricey ($13/30g). I went through a tube pretty quickly initially to get my eczema under control, and once it was under control, I only use one tube per 4-5 months, so if it’s working for you, it might be worth waiting out and investing in. :)"

I wanted to make a cheesecake and curry for the fam, so there was extra groceries on top of the usual buys and ended up with two bags full. In hindsight, this probably wasn’t the best move and I should’ve only bought what I usually bought to survive me for another two weeks instead of adding the luxury of cheesecake ingredients, because I’m adding onto the burden of the panic buyers. I have anxiety and I’ve been thinking about it all morning because I feel awful about what I’ve just done. Just wanted to get it out there. Sorry from all those ppl I may’ve stolen from :("
melbourne,fl2cyid,t1_fl2a36f,1584748169.0,Went out this morning and wore one just as extra precaution. Reallllyyy don’t want my mum getting sick. Not a lot of ppl were wearing one though. I don’t like how ppl are shaming or shunning ppl who do wear one tho. It’s not necessary but it’s also not unnecessary. There’s a low chance right now of contracting the virus but wearing one will give you that little bit more chance of not contracting the virus. Go for what your heart desires.

People (both old and young) still going to bars and restaurants and being out and about in the streets without practising safe social distancing measures. Also within my own connections I still see so many young people going out to eat. I don’t think I’ll be happy with how things are going until I see a majority of ppl taking this seriously, staying home, closing restaurants and moving to delivery only, so that people who actually NEED to go out will be able to safely. There’s other things we need to keep pushing for as well, but this is my current concern."

Anxiety,fkzetj8,t3_flljh6,1584669329.0,"Yes! I literally just tried going to the post office after being home for two weeks straight. The post office is only a five minute walk away, but I ended up having to go back home without posting my package because I was just experiencing so much anxiety. 

On my walk to the post office, there were so many people outside not practising social distancing. When I arrived at the post office it was empty, but straight after me, like 8 people burst in. I was hoping I’d be able to fumble around with packages and ask the server dumb questions about how to post a package, but social anxiety was peaking with the audience. I was thinking to myself: do I need to pay for the package container first then package it myself? Do I just give it all to the server and do they package it all for me? Just so many questions and thoughts overwhelmed my brain and I left without posting my package. Walked back home, arrived home and was faced with my dad giving me an hateful look (I am not close with my dad, he is often mean to me). Pretty much made me snap. Went into my room and thought about everything that happened. Thought it was gonna be alright, but I suddenly just burst out in tears and haven’t been able to recover. 

I am usually alright with going out and being around people, but I feel like not having physically talked to anyone or been outside in the past two weeks has done something to my anxiety. I feel like it’s cos we get used to not having so much to deal with in the comfort of our own homes and we get used to everything kinda being more or less within our control, that when we do go out and there’s just so many things going on, things that catch our attention and things we have to deal with that we just get so overwhelmed and start thinking crazy things."

melbourne,fks5nu8,t1_fkqdcvf,1584482801.0,"Hahahah ngl when I posted my comment I wasn’t expecting some odd metaphorical comparison (no offence, it was interesting though, just not right for this situation). I didn’t stockpile anything when the craze began because I had sufficient food and tp for at least a week and participating in the stockpiling would only take away from the ability of others who didn’t have as much as me to be buying what they need. 

I’m happy you‘ve been able to obtain all that you want and need, but I really don’t think the way you’re viewing this situation is right at all. 

There really is no need to stockpile. There is plentiful food to go around (Australia usually exports a lot of the food they produce), and if we all practise social distancing (as we are doing quite effectively), going out to the supermarkets as we regularly do won’t be that dangerous. If we have the option to create a situation where everybody is able to stay happy and healthy, then why wouldn’t we choose to do so? You or anyone else won’t be able to get out of this pandemic situation unless you support others’ basic needs, which then support our ability to do greater things for the community.

melbourne,fks08wp,t1_fkqf8em,1584479590.0,"I understand your frustration towards this seemingly unfair situation, but it really honestly is for the better. It ensures the elderly are able to buy what they need so that they are then able to stay in self-quarantine as much as possible. So, even if they are “hoarding,” they’re really honestly doing what’s necessary to prevent avoidable deaths. Having a stockpile for them means not having to go out as much and therefore less chances of getting sick! They’re the most at-risk group of people of dying, and so putting in simple measures like this is really a compassionate gesture to uphold our sense of humanity in a very difficult time for all of us. By your reaction, I am assuming you may have had difficulty getting what you want or need at the supermarkets, and if that’s the case, I’m happy to help you in anyway I can. Stay safe, friend."

melbourne,fkqe1hq,t1_fkqcvpz,1584442240.0,"Oh jeez, I didn’t know that. I naively thought people would take the situation seriously and not go out. A lot of the problem seems to be psychological. Health experts are unable to effectively inform the public about the best way to deal with the virus situation. Also, surely educators should work with parents who are able to stay at home with kids how to best “deal with” them whilst also staying indoors? As for teenagers and university students, high schools and universities need to be more proactive in advising students what to and what not to do at this time. All students are more than likely paying close attention to school announcements right now in this unsure time, so why not take advantage of the attention and disseminate the correct information?"
melbourne,fkqcu6d,t1_fkll3zk,1584440769.0,"I agree. I know we go on a lot about the elderly, immune compromised people, and other people at high risk of dying from the virus, but everyone else will also highly likely be directly affected if they catch the virus. Just as the SARS virus did, the coronavirus is more than likely to leave people with long-term negative health effects after recovering. Some papers have reported possible reduced lung capacity. Everyone is at risk, some more than others, and so we need everyone putting in their own part to help reduce the spread of the virus."

melbourne,fkqc1w1,t3_fjsrmc,1584439766.0,"Hey guys, sorry if this has been discussed before, but I was wondering how ppl are able to buy toilet paper or just anything from the supermarket? 

My family didn’t participate in the stockpiling frenzy because we had a pack of tp, and didn’t want to add to the craze, but now our supplies have depleted and can’t find any tp anywhere near us. We don’t mind just washing our asses after taking a poop but we’re just accustomed to using tp to wipe our asses, that we’d prefer the tp option if we had it. 

Also, supermarket shelves are literally stripped bare where I live, and I was wondering how ppl are actually buying food? Do people go at a certain time? Are people driving to other supermarkets??

unimelb,fj11b30,t3_facukw,1582911270.0,"Hey OP, I’m so sorry to hear about your experience. I know you must be going through a tough time, but uni hasn’t even started so don’t give up yet. As many people have pointed out, you don’t really form solid friendships in O-week, rather it’s in your tutes, lectures, and clubs and societies that you make friends. However, keep coming to the peer mentor meetings and hope that other ppl rock up. If not, you always have your mentor to chat to! There are also tours being held during week one of semester if you missed out (check the UMSU website). 

In your tutes and lectures though, don’t be afraid to say hi and out yourself out there, and if you meet someone you get along with, make sure to add them on fb. As the semester goes on you’ll probably contact each other more often about uni and the subject you’re studying together. Hopefully, a friendship will blossom from then on. Ask them if they’re a part of any clubs and societies and if you guys have any in common then suggest you go to their event together. 

If you can’t find someone else to go with, totally go by yourself and try mingling at club events/meetings. It would be worth letting someone on the committee know you wish to come but don’t have any friends to go with or at the event. They’ll definitely take care of you and make sure you’ll meet ppl at the event. 

I know this all sounds very daunting and it may not work out initially but me and a lot of other ppl are cheering you on. If it doesn’t work out right away, know that you have so many more opportunities to succeed. 

All the best OP x"

unimelb,f5s6eyd,t1_f5s61p5,1572413761.0,Oh jeez I just got told I should apply for ongoing special consideration by a stop 1 worker if I wanted to take special exams?! Will special consideration under unexpected circumstances allow me to take all four of my exams during the special exam period?
kpop,f5g8nwu,t3_dm2b5c,1572190686.0,"I don’t think this is as great a law that everyone’s making it out to be. I think it’s a short-term intervention that’ll be helpful in spreading the message that hateful comments aren’t ok, but ignoring hate isn’t going to do anything for anyone in the long-term. It does nothing for building resilience and the ability to stay strong in the face of hate, which is something someone will inevitably experience as a celebrity. If the case of Sulli says anything about what we should do in the future, it’s about creating better support systems for people who are in tough situations like her and putting in better educative programs for them before they enter the celebrity lifestyle. More than anything though, I think Koreans and kpop culture both have an important message to learn about celebrating diversity, not shunning difference."

unimelb,f3po2xm,t1_f3pgjbr,1571062292.0,Ohh true that sucks. The Ebola situation is pretty interesting rn. I’m not super sure about any others besides the rise in antibiotic resistance. Probs just look online and you’ll find one that’s interesting
unimelb,f3pgqzs,t1_f3pg4b5,1571058853.0,"Honestly, I barely remember what that might mean. Surely ask the lecturer, though. I would look back at my notes if you still don’t understand it but that’d have to be after I submit all my assignments hahahah"
unimelb,f3pfwp6,t1_f3p0mqz,1571058224.0,"We weren’t given the option to choose our own disease! They actually made up a fake scenario of a virus outbreak and we all had to write about how we’d deal with that. HIV/AIDS would actually be a good topic to write about just because there’s so much research done on it. However, I think it might be what a lot of people will choose, and if there’s anything they want, it’s something unique. I would recommend checking out the recent outbreaks of Ebola! It’s very applicable to all the disciplines, and you could make the point that psychology and geography undermines the effectiveness of strategies to prevent, treat and control the disease, because though vaccines have proven effective, the people have a lot of distrust in the government and believe they are spreading the virus via vaccines to control the population so they are refusing vaccines and are looking to folk remedies (if that’s what you call it). That’s just one suggestion, but feel free to choose anything. Look at recent news and see what has a juicy case for you to unpack."
depression,f3luv1e,t1_f37a1z2,1570979848.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience and the encouraging words! I am doing better than I was when I posted it - not amazingly but I’ve put those thoughts a little to the side so I can focus on those simple things you mentioned. Hoping I can maintain this and am able to do as you said. Happy for you that you’ve also been able to move past that terrible experience. Hopefully, we can move forward together. :)"
socialanxiety,f3lu56k,t1_f387bd2,1570979609.0,"Thank you for taking the time to write this! It makes a lot of sense, especially the part about behaving according to my thoughts instead of my feelings. It provides a new perspective for me to think about and possibly try out next time I’m in a social situation. 

As much as this was very helpful though, I think it would be worth wording it a little differently. I’m not as sensitive, but it does sound a bit aggressive, especially to ppl who are going through a lot of inner turmoil, and talking to them in this assertive, “this is right and this is wrong” sort of way might have effects opposite to it’s original intention. 

I’m glad though you have some really great insight to share after going through your own struggles and are willing to share this knowledge! Thank you again."
socialanxiety,f3lriir,t1_f38btg2,1570978866.0,"Thank you for taking the time to write this out. I totally understand what you mean; it’s something I’ve thought about before and understand well. I’m putting myself in more social situations so that I can incorporate these beliefs and thoughts with actual behaviour, but it’s just tough right now in this time that I’m trying to shift my thinking. It’s been going wrong a lot but I’ll keep on pushing and trying until I’m able to fully act upon these thoughts and be who I am. Thanks for the encouragement - the part where you talked about having the opportunity to do many more “right” things in the future was especially helpful."
socialanxiety,f3lq23l,t1_f390g49,1570978464.0,"Yea, it’s tough. Social anxiety stops you from doing things that are actually really simple when you’re in front of others. I don’t blame people for the way they react though; they probably aren’t as educated as they ideally should be about mental illness, but it’s also difficult on us because them not understanding how debilitating our illness is exacerbates the illness itself. It’s a tough situation that we can’t do much about (besides educating others, but that requires some social interaction so....), so until the right people come up with the right solutions, I hope you’re able to find people who are more understanding of your situation and that will help you to open up more in public :)"
socialanxiety,f3loeej,t1_f39i2a5,1570978016.0,"Ye that’s true. I don’t think it’s all on society’s part though; it’s more the role of a range of different things, including poor social environments, my own upbringing, and my resultant state of mind."
depression,f3lnldx,t1_f3a5tnz,1570977788.0,"I am so sorry you guys are going through some really painful and difficult times, so much so that you’re considering taking your life. I’m also sorry if what I commented prompted any negative thoughts. I just wanted to share my feelings so we can find some solidarity in having similar experiences. 

If you ever need anyone to talk to about what you’re going through, remember that there is this whole community in Reddit that will listen to and support you, without judging you because we are all either going through or have experienced similar things to you. I go through suicidal thoughts as well because of the pain my own mind gives me, but I also know that everyone has a life worth living and it takes effort to discover what that might be. I hope you will be able to find the motivation to do so and I wish you all the best in life! I’m rooting for you."
unimelb,f3lk72r,t1_f3e6mpk,1570976780.0,"Oh sorry, didn’t quite catch that from your post. Maybe reword it? Bc that is actually a really interesting question - to know about the topics at the centre of discussion for each field of study."
CongratsLikeImFive,f3ljgv5,t1_f3laanq,1570976523.0,Thank you so much! It means a lot. Fingers crossed I can get into a better cleaning and eating routine!
CongratsLikeImFive,f3lir8r,t1_f3lb3hi,1570976381.0,"I am so sorry I did not know not showering was a cross-border issue! Will try and shower more often for the sake of ppl in neighbouring countries. 

I actually haven’t talked to my family properly in a few years and we aren’t very open or affectionate so it’d be a bit difficult. They’re also very traditional Asian parents so they don’t even understand the concept of mental health. I plan to tell them one day because my resultant behaviour has affected them quite a lot, but it might take a while and I’d have to actually think it out pretty thoroughly so as not to burden them,  make them uncomfortable but also to educate them in the correct ways about mental illness.

Thanks though for the concern and your humorous comment. Nice to feel acknowledged!"
unimelb,f3j0t4n,t1_f3ilxmj,1570945175.0,"No, downvoted by ppl who think your comment is unhelpful. Just because OP is asking for answers for past exam papers, doesn’t mean they aren’t studying hard. It might even be a sign that they are working hard, trying to make the best of the resources they have to learn. It’s great to see you valuing hard work but don’t let that passion slip into picking on others whose definition of work don’t match yours. The negative comment is unnecessary and irrelevant."
lonely,f3dx8wz,t3_dgj5tu,1570849787.0,"I have never really had weekends out so I actually don’t know what I’m missing out on which means I don’t mind my lonely weekend nights. I get a lot of stress from mental health issues so it doesn’t really give me time to think about being lonely until I’m really sad and down in the dumps and realise I have no one to talk to about it. Whilst I watch everyone else go out at night, I love using Friday nights to listen to new music and watch YouTube videos. I follow New Music Fridays on Spotify, and it gives me something to look forward to at the end of the week! 

I would, though, if I had the opportunity to go out with others, I totally would. And the idea is quite riveting to me. My group I’m working with for a uni assignment agreed to meet up on a Friday night to get some work done. One of them agreed it was kinda sad so she proposed we go to her house for wine and pizza and in that moment I realised this was something I didn’t know I ever needed: people to have fun with. I can’t describe just how excited I was. One guy unfortunately wanted to reserve the Friday for his gf, and that kind of brought it all back to reality and I realised: oh, right, these people have social lives outside of this group. So, now we’re just meeting up to discuss the assignment on a Monday morning. I’m honestly kind of upset, but I also understand. I just understand. And accept."
