infj,fggthu6,t3_ey8p7o,1580769201.0,"Oh, I definitely feel the same! I love creating, doodling, drawing, making comics, etc. Sooooo many times, not just with art, but with posting things online in general (especially if it's creative), I get anxious really quick and I end up deleting it. I just imagine all those eyes on my work, and it's a bit much for me. That's happened with short stories I've wrote, interactive stories on instagram, or just goofy stuff I put out. For now, I've created an alternate account with a secret identity, and I use it to post little silly comics. But it's not so secret and it's pretty obviously me, so I've just been putting out little simple and goofy comics or just some drawings. Occasionally I have been able to publicly post things and I've gotten some good responses, which always brightens me up. Sometimes I just gotta remember that I want others to enjoy this work while I'm having fun at the same time.

Anyway, I understand your position! I *do* think social media has made that kinda creative anxiety worse, even though it's also made it more accessible for people to get out there. But that's a whole other discussion. I say take it one step at a time! Release small things at first and slowly build up! And you can make a secret identity account too! I think that could be helpful and almost fun to be in hiding a bit. I don't think it's avoiding the main issue or any confrontation lol, sometimes you just gotta do what you're comfortable with. Best of luck!!!!"
infj,ffiu6nm,t1_ffiekid,1579982816.0,"> Simply put, I door slam when somone has reached the end of my tolerance, exhausted any and every effort at friendship, taken advantage of me, or constantly whines and asks for help and never accepts that help. In short, if I have to be 100% defensive around somone 100% of the time, they risk grounds for door slam.

Exactly! This is the precise explanation for my door-slam. So well put!"
infj,ffiu1yw,t3_etpj4u,1579982725.0,"I can def relate to the second point, door slamming when you're hurt and you want them out. I think if there isn't reason to stay in contact, I don't necessarily ""door-slam"" them, it's just that our time has passed. I imagine the term is used when it's something mostly negative. I wish I could give you some advice on how to control it, but I don't think I'm very experienced to say. Maybe just as you go along with certain relationships, you don't have to see that relationship only going in two ways, either in continuation or a door-slam. Sometimes other paths appear. You could leave each other on good terms, you might just stop talking because your life situations have changed, you both found different interests, etc. These aren't happy situations to think about of course (fading friendships always make me kinda sad, even if things weren't very significant), but I don't think they're totally negative either. If you've come to a situation where there's not much reason for contact, then just leave it at that maybe. You don't have to do anything and you don't have to declare that, ok this is how I'm going to deal with them from now on. You can just stay not-contacting. And if they come up again, then cool!

Idk if that was much help to anything. But in terms of personally door-slamming, I can only think of one situation where I've done it. I've probably done more but I have a really bad memory. Even so, I think my definition/outcome/thought of the door slam is prob different than what most think. Long story short, this guy was basically a friend I wanted to really invest a friendship in. And I can recall many of my own actions that show that. And basically over-time, signs just came up that I honestly didn't like but decided to ignore, and then there was this kinda betrayal-last-straw moment. I think he's pretty oblivious to the slam, but basically I've completely cut the chance of this ever being as close a friendship as I could have hoped. I still see him quite a bit and I'm friendly and we can be sorta funny together, but I've def distanced myself and cut off any a chance. I imagine that's a bit diff than the blown up idea that a door slam is like cutting someone out of existence. Anyway, I ramble. Sorry If couldn't offer much advice. But best of luck to you!

As u/SabrinaTheCat92 puts it:
>Simply put, I door slam when somone has reached the end of my tolerance, exhausted any and every effort at friendship, taken advantage of me, or constantly whines and asks for help and never accepts that help. In short, if I have to be 100% defensive around somone 100% of the time, they risk grounds for door slam.

This perfectly describes the situation I was talking about! That guy checks off all those."

Yea, precisely! I hate that as well. I think for us at least, esp as we mature, we can tell when we push ourselves too thin, because then we become drained lol We just want to love!

Never let go! But also, maybe try to step back a bit. Give yourself time to assess your situation. Maybe there are times where it's better not to put much effort in. Look at where your energy is going, and try to direct it better. And then maybe you'll be able to see a better response! Of course, we're not just doing good so we can get a response, but this while one sided love convo means we def do need ppl around us who can love us well."
infj,fekw6pq,t3_epihd9,1579208862.0,"I don't think it'd be fair to say that codependency is just an INFJ thing, but I think it makes sense to say that we're more susceptible to that kind of thing. Or at least, I know I am. Some years ago, and prob still a bit now as well, I know I struggled with being codependent. I put so much effort into pleasing people and trying to make others feel good. Partially because it was genuinely nice, but I'm sure part of that was selfish just so I'd feel good about myself (and I don't want this to discount that I was an actually good person, I just had faults of course). I remember in a little ""therapy"" session with a teacher, back I high school, she asked me what made me feel good. And after thinking about it for a moment, I said, ""Making other people feel good makes me feel good."" She was delighted and prob thought that it was really commendable, which it usually should be. But I remember when I said that, I didn't feel happy. I didn't exactly feel good about it.

Luckily, I didn't let go of those good qualities completely. Instead, I think I've transformed them into something more genuine. Something where I'm not spreading myself way too thin or just trying to please anyone. So to just directly answer the title Q, I think INFJs are simply more susceptible to being codependent. So there is some truth to it. But to describe my more healthy experience, I can say I relate to what you said, OP, in that last paragraph 100000%.

>In relationships I care about my needs just as much as my partner's.

EXACTLY. That is not codependency. And this is incredibly frustrating when people don't get it, which I think is what prompted this post haha. If I'm in a relationship (disclaimer: I haven't been, but I can still understand the feeling based on friendships), I want to show you that I love you. Obviously there's a line between that kind of love and then just unhealthy emotional dumping, and that should be addressed where it comes up. But the bottom line is, I LOVE YOU, so I'm going to want to please you. I'm not going to bend over backwards for every tiny thing, but of course I'm still going to put in a lot of extra effort. And that effort simply comes from the fact that I like the person. In these situations, I don't think INFJs are in the fault at all. And maybe the other person isn't either. But I think it's nothing wrong with you, it's just that they're not as capable in putting in that emotional work. And that's okay I suppose, but that just means that the partner that's right for us is someone who's willing to take that effort and also give it.

It's something I worry about a lot. I really hope I can end up with someone who's willing to take and give that effort, someone who can see my effort for what it is (love), and not some bending over backwards kind of over-pleasing."

That's all like a giant barrier in your life, and it must really hurt. Sigh... I wish parents would be okay with admitting fault, or at least taking a chance and evaluating themselves. That's something I know I want to remind myself if I become a parent. And especially at such a rough time in your life, and they still couldn't?? I'm so sorry. I wish they could have been the support you needed at that time.

What really sucks especially when you try to relay how bad that makes you feel and they get defensive, just like OP said, it's really hard to articulate how you feel. Like you know, deep in your heart, what you mean and what's right, but then it just can't come out or they just can't understand it. It's so incredibly frustrating.

Yea, I'm also the only infj in my immediate family (the only family that's around me) and I def relate to all you said. I would abs love if I could have those kinds of convos with my people...but it just can't happen. We def talk and have good discussions but that's only here and there. And sometimes if it's about something urgent that just has to be said, sometimes I can't hold back.
Another thing on my negative list would be when I get excited for stuff. I love looking forward to things. And I just can't exactly express that to my fam without eventually seeming annoying. It really stinks, because I wish I could fully express my happy myself and not hold back that much. But it is as it is...
I agree with your positives as well! There are still good things being us! Even though I can't express myself as I will here, I do have a close infj friend I can do that with when I see them. But sometimes that's a bit far & in between :/ But life is life!"

infj,fdcflwi,t1_fdcc89x,1578273696.0,"I think it definitely could, especially if you feel like you've run out of options and just want to know. Sometimes it's best to be direct. But there's also no harm in giving it some time, that just might give you more confidence about the whole thing. Maybe you'll see a sign that makes you think she really does like you, etc. From your post and other's interpretations, it sounds like she might. But it wouldn't hurt to wait a bit (except maybe emotionally). And if you do feel like the time is right to tell her and it turns out she likes you, I think you'll find that she'll like that you were straight up and direct.

I really hope I'm not just spewing nonsense, given that I don't have any experience. I just have exp being an infj! But overall, I really do hope this turns out nicely for you!

Edit: also maybe just straight up telling her u like her would be better than asking if she likes you? Not sure but access the situation and follow your heart!
(Ex: ""hey, I like you. I was wondering if you felt the same"")"
infj,fdcc0c9,t3_eki6ij,1578271280.0,"It's hard to say honestly. Just because she's talking to you about deep stuff might not mean she's into you, just that she trusts you enough to talk about that stuff. If you can give it some time to find some more sure signs, go for it. Or if you're up for just straight up asking her, that might work too. Just be kind and don't try to hold her own personality, or whatever it is that you might of thought indicated that she liked you, against her (if she doesn't like you).
I can't really speak on the difference that indicates actually flirting, or signs, just because I don't have experience there. Sorry man. But I know that sometimes she might just tell you herself. But basically, I can understand that it's hard to figure out the difference between friendly and liking. I do hope this goes well for you! Best of luck to you"
infj,fctpi32,t3_eiirgs,1577952903.0,"You're not alone!

I know I'm younger and not in much of a position to give anything close to advice, but here's my perspective. It honestly makes sense to me. I can see little flares of it in myself. I'm mostly a calm person, but every once in a while, whatever holds back the anger kinda cracks. But my situation isn't as intense. Instead, I've really seen that with feeling bitter and insecure.

Back in high school, I know I had those feelings of feeling inadequate and then jealous. But now, years down the line, I suddenly just see the insecurities come out as way more intense. Even though I've become a lot more mature, and I know exactly the kind of advice I'd give to someone suffering in my situation, I just can't escape it.

It's like I've hit a breaking point. Like I got punctured and all the insecurities and bitterness and anything else related that I didn't know was bottled up, is just shooting out. Sigh. I'm still learning and trying to deal with this. And I wish I could give you some advice or some solution, but I at least want you to know it's not something weird or necessarily bad. I know despite the deep anger, you're a good person and you mean well. And you're likely still the wonderful outside infj personality that you are.

infj,fch8e6d,t3_eh3xcc,1577648188.0,"Kinda sad to say, but I can relate just a bit! My situation hasn't been as bad or intense as yours, but what struck me in your post was how you said that you've only had examples of what not to do.

For me, the idea of becoming a father (I'm also 20 M, so it's a ways away) is such a beautiful thought to me. I honestly can't wait until I'm able to experience all that. I have so many thoughts and ideas about it, I could go on forever. But to stick to the point, it's something I am really excited for.

And yet, I've also only ever seen what not to do. My parents' marriage has shown me so much of what I absolutely hate. And this is mostly all I've ever really known. I remember even as a young kid, I would consciously think, ok I need to remember how I feel about this as a kid so I can know how bad it was as an adult. That was so as an adult, I'd know how those kind of adult actions affect kids. But I believe that you and I, despite having to face that as basically the main relationship experience in our lives, can be great fathers. I don't think you have to worry. Because we can recognize what we don't want to do! We know how it makes us feel, and so we know not to do it onto others. We're feeling, caring, protective, and you're being proactive! I think you'd make a wonderful parent, and thinking about all that stuff in the future is totally fine (and something I always do because it's so fascinating!).

Obviously we're not perfect, and we're not going to be perfect dads. Even as we can differentiate that this is exactly what we don't want to do, always keep a careful and evaluating eye on yourself. I didn't think it was possible at first, but with the amount of time I've been with my father and his mannerisms (for example), it's only natural that I'd be unconsciously influenced. So keep an eye out on your own traits and always look for ways to improve. You're gonna be an amazing dad, and I think kids will be lucky to have a figure like you in their lives."

Okay, so you were set to graduate and you're basically nearly done. It sounds like your classes were manageable, it just that a certain amount of life hit you at the wrong time (and then the depression). That's totally understandable. So you'll be staying in your major. And good thing you're meeting with an advisor. To deal with the other problems, a therapist could be helpful as well as you said. I can't speak much on that though. CAPS is a nice resource, it's just that my experience wasn't all too helpful (but def try it out if you can! Figure out all your options).

For now, all that's gonna happen is you'll be on probation until you can get your academics back up. Maybe consider going part time next semester? So that your problems + classes don't push you to your limit. Since you were in your last year, I imagine you don't have many GEs, or anything that could be easier, left over. I think what I tried once was only taking a small bit of major stuff with a couple GEs to balance out how tough classes were. Since your graduation is already extended, please don't try to take on too much. Don't be afraid to stretch the time out if you need to. Life hits us in different ways, don't be afraid to adjust. Figure out what those options can be with the advisor.

I wish you the very best! Def use this winter break to recoup. You haven't lost everything yet, so once you figure out a plan, you can get back into the semester with a new hope. Message me if you need anything."

So you'll be put on academic probation. If you receive financial aid, you might have to submit an appeal (since receiving aid depends on certain academic requirements), tho u might have to do that after next sem. And on probation, you'll have to go to a workshop and I think a meeting w an undergrad advisor (not tote sure about the meeting). And basically it's this black cloud of doom looming over your head the whole semester, saying u gotta get better or they'll kick you out.

So now you've got to figure out what to do. Idk if the reason you're failing is bc of something hard going on in life or if the classes are tough. If it's life, maybe you feel like just retaking the classes would be good enough. But be VERY realistic, and easy on yourself, and don't take on too much (when u register). If it's that the classes are unbearably hard, you should change your major. You might be in a situation where you ""can't"" (parents won't let you, this is something you're passionate about, other pressure, etc), but trust me, you need to, or else you will simply face this kind of torture over and over. Some things aren't for everyone, and I learned that the hard way. Try to find some study still close to what you like, but not as tough. But if the classes were hard just because you took it all at once, and you feel like you could do them if you retake them, spread them out and make it easier for yourself and don't be too prideful if you need to take more time to graduate than others.

I know how horrible you must feel, not to mention whatever else you're going through. Please message me if you need some help, I've had some experience failing things over and over and over...and over. You can get out of this.

toastme,erae0pe,t3_c0x0s9,1560641298.0,"Here's a toast to your beautiful smile and hair! I know just about everyone has complimented that, but wow, isn't it amazing how we can live in a world with such nice smiles? I saw someone make a post about that just the other day. I always try and remember to smile at people. It's so kind and so simple. Some people are just so done with everything in this world, sometimes a smile is all it takes to help them back up.

I'm really really sorry I can't have some solid advice about how not to be so suicidal... It hurts when I can't really help people. But I hope this as brightened your mood a bit, just like your smile brightened mine! If you'd like to talk, I'm here for you"

infj,eon22gy,t3_bsaxys,1558702087.0,"Totally totally agree! I felt this and couldn't explain it, but you nailed it. It's like the feeling of the song disappears. And it's not like I necessarily want to impress anyone with my music, but in those situations, I end up skipping a lot of songs I recall as significant, and then I'm listening to nothing :( Yea the ppl make it pretty dull.

Unless it's songs on the radio in a van full of great people! Then the most basic songs become emotional!"
