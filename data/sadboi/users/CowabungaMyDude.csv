Once I get familiar or decent/good at something I drop it and end up going back to my video game safe haven.

However human and animal behaviour and interactions are my one true special interest. My mind is pretty much a non stop simulation of possible most realistic interactions and all possible outcomes. During that I also try to figure out my opinion on every point of view and what drives people to believe their point of view is valid.

Anyway to answer your question: You can upload clips straight to Youtube, Twitter or Facebook from your ps4. I use youtube and once it's uploaded on my channel the youtube video has a ''Share'' button too. 
Click this, and you'll get a list of options to share it to,  select reddit, search for the subreddit you want to post the video in and give it a title. 

This doesn't give those embedded video's you tend to see but takes you to the channel instead.
If anybody knows how that works I'd love to know haha"

If you want to record on ps4 you can hold down the share option to open the menu and manually save with square.
On my system I have it set to press share for a screenshot and double tap to save my last 15 minutes but I'm not sure what the original buttons are.
 Maybe a tutorial will pop up if you hold share down, there's a few options you can tweak such as button inputs and recording length under settings. 

Once you know what does what it's pretty easy to save raw gameplay footage which will be saved in the Capture Gallery. 
Pressing options on the thumbnail of the saved video guves you the option ''Trim'' which let's you cut the fat and cut out the part you want. 

If you want to edit the video's there's a thing called sharefactory on ps4 but I don't use that personally haha.
Finally you can link your social media like youtube or Twitter to the ps4 and upload the video by holding the share button on the thumbnail of the video you want to upload.

The menu's are cluttered, I agree on that. Still screw up setting my favorite faction when I want to change skin and I tend to loop on weapon selection a lot. The game itself is fun though, but battle royale is a whole beast on it's own which takes a few hours to get used to the concept."
AskReddit,flaweev,t3_fnmw3x,1584992481.0,World wide battle royale would be kinda dope
apexlegends,fl2wel0,t1_fl2t159,1584761687.0,"Don't get me wrong, Caustic is great. It's just that he plays very different and had a pretty high learning curve for me.

I bought Crypto with cash and he was amazing for learning both the tactical positioning of his drone and your character. His drone helped me with learning where and where to possibly expect people and that carries over to the other legends including Caustic.

On the other hand my buddy picked him up and just wrecked people from the getgo. It's weirdly personal

A simulated match VS bots would be fine too I guess"
apexlegends,fl2r9nf,t3_fm6lbr,1584757894.0,"I've always thought they should let you use all Legends in the Shooting range regardless of level or whatever. Just so you can play around with them in a confined section before going into battle.

I thought I was going to have a blast with Caustic but I ended up regretting getting him first. It's kinda demoralizing to realize you need to wait another 24 levels before you can hope to pick something that fits you."
CODWarzone,fl2ivnu,t3_fm4gcm,1584752074.0,"Me and my boys turn off the auto-fill just for this tbh. We're in a party, talking our native language having a giggle and don't want to be a burden to random teammates.
People without a mic should learn to use the ping system too. It's crucial for callouts and team orientation.

We did end up with a third today by accident and he carried us all the way to #3 so shout out to that guy."

WHITE IRON VIRGIN! AWKWARD ASTERISK ASSAULT!

Unbelievable! His attack blasted him straight out of my DM's. Such strength"

I'll never forgive the Japanese!"
AskReddit,fkvurxb,t1_fkvtzqs,1584577151.0,"That's what I was trying to say haha, love RTJ but then the soundcloud boys came in.

Speaking of Codeine here's some South Africa for flavor: https://youtu.be/4x61CjvIvZE

Love these guys and PHFAT, relics of the past by now."
Cryptomains,fkvttg8,t3_fk2hw6,1584576587.0,"You should post this in r/ApexOutlands too

Made one calling out Caustic mains in good fun and it's been heated to say the least"
AskReddit,fkvt2op,t1_fkvrfkb,1584576145.0,Run the Jewels was amazing when I first discovered them. Don't think that's mumble rap but after their last album I feel like the US shifted overnight.
