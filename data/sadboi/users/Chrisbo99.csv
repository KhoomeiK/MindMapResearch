Jung,fqvhjtz,t1_fqv81ep,1589677405.0,Basically a 6-month LSD trip without the euphoria. Everything Carl Jung has described is 100% accurate. I can't fathom how he was able to pull this much information out so easily.
DeepIntoYouTube,fqvgmdx,t1_fqv82ce,1589676846.0,As someone has dealt with psychosis this is a very serious thing shes dealing with. What she's experiencing is just as if not more real than anything we could imagine. True pain. Wish someone would have shot me. Even living with the memory of my psychosis is unbearable

GetMotivated,fqreu95,t1_fqre9eg,1589582960.0,"Oh, I forgot that LSD was the only drug in existence to contain the compounds that Ehrlich is able to detect. There are dozens (if not hundreds) of analogues being produced each year with fatal consequences. Most are harmless but it's still not worth the risk, imo. Stick to shrooms. Heard too many stories. Stay safe homie. I'll see if I can find an article later"

RationalPsychonaut,fp690ki,t1_fp666wj,1588348241.0,"You'll acquire knowledge involuntarily with the tools you manifest during your transformation. Life just becomes very flat and meaningless and cultivating purpose from the empty expanse that your reality becomes can be very difficult. You're thrust into the ""real world"" so to speak. Your ego will do its best to hold you back which can be very painful and traumatizing. This shift does not guarantee happiness and good vibes. My experience has been different than most. Mine was brought on by psychosis which lead to a terryfing spiritual awakening and I'm just now starting my recovery. Saw things I wish I couldnt have. Saw the pandemic and many  worse things to come beginning in September of last year. Really weird shit. Really easy to go insane and become detached. Read Carl Jung to get a better idea"
