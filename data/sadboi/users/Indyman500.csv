I don’t know if you do couponing but if you don’t I would look into that as you can save some good money. I don’t know if where you live does stuff like that but again if you can I would. You might have to buy foods that you normally wouldn’t eat because they are cheaper but look at it as your are trying out new foods. The main things is to just plan ahead, cut expenses where you can such as eating out, buying expensive foods at the grocery store, unnecessary purchases for yourself ect. Just be smart with your money and you should be relatively fine. All the best of luck to ya!"
depression,ffwxbt6,t3_evjgii,1580313131.0,"I was in the same boat you were just recently and when I say recently I mean about a year ago I think? I talked to one of my friends whom I consider to be the closest with and she told me something along the lines of “it seems like normal means aren’t working out for you to help you get better. I think you should check into a mental health place”. Now for more than half my life (26 years of age) I’ve been depressed and I’ve been on all sorts of medications and seen different  psychiatrists and some of them helped for a time but it wasn’t really a complete fix. I did tell my psychiatrists all about how I was feeling and stuff but the means and methods they would say to do never really helped. I’ve always been afraid of mental health institutes because as far as I’ve known there’s always been a stigma with them that if you go to one you are deemed as “crazy” but I learned that’s not the case and I was just worrying about what others would think about me. I have a really strong core friend group and I realized that they love me and would never think of me as crazy for trying to seek the help I so desperately needed. I ended up going to a very nice mental health institute and got some amazing help that I desperately needed. I think the main thing that I actually needed was to really get away from everyone and everything and go into a completely new environment to get better. I don’t know where you are from and even if your country has mental health institutes but I highly recommend voluntarily checking yourself into one but before you do that I would do research on the one(s) you want to enter as each and everyone of them are not the same. 

Good luck to you."

TrueOffMyChest,f202iu0,t1_f202d5a,1569854304.0,That’s one thing out of many. There’s more issues than the ozone layer.
TrueOffMyChest,f200cd2,t1_f1z8b0k,1569853256.0,I do like how you think I spend my time worrying about something that I have no power of such as climate change to which I don’t. The reason I posted this was because me and my friends were hanging out yesterday and we go into the topic of the UN situation with greta thunberg. In a short summary one of my friends thinks that we can do something about the climate change and we should keep trying to fix everything to which he isn’t wrong but unfortunately there is no fix as the damage has been done but we can prevent future damage but that’s just simply not going to happen with the amount of people that are currently doing anything.  I don’t care about the climate change at all and it’s not something to even bother using any of my time towards but what I am annoyed about which I feel as you completely missed the point of is that people are trying to convince the people in charge to do something to fix the environment when they don’t care at all and have better things to worry about and I’m annoyed that people don’t realize this and still continue to push and try and convince them when it just won’t happen so in the end it is a waste of time. Until the current generation of people that are in charge are out of office and shit nothing is going to change because they simply don’t care and by the time that does happen and fix we try to implement to even lessen or slow the effects of what’s happening by that time it’s way past to late. I want people to stop wasting their time and energy about something they can’t change and just move on with their life.
TrueOffMyChest,f1zyz1j,t1_f1z4o3a,1569852586.0,"Yes there is no fix unfortunately but what I’m annoyed with is people who are all about the cause and everything if trying to save the planet is that they don’t realize we can’t prevent more damage, we are still doing damage to the planet everyday. Anything that has been done to help clean or save the planet or whatever has just been undone the next day by something else. I wish people realized that we can’t do anything at all, it’s like trying to get water out of a sinking ship with a bucket when there’s a hole in the ship but they don’t plug up the hole. I just want people to realize they can’t do anything and to just move on a live their lives of what time they have left instead of worry and trying to do something that nothing can be done about, it’s all a waste of time energy and resources."
TrueOffMyChest,f1zyekr,t1_f1zom9n,1569852304.0,"I’m all for trying to slow and lessen the effects but the way things are going and have been going they don’t make even a slight impact, anything that we have done to to slow and lesson the effects has just been undone the next day. I’d love for everyone to do some heavy work but 90-95% of the people on the planet they might care about the cause and everything but won’t end up doing anything. Not enough people truly care, it’s like trying to get water out of a sinking ship with a bucket when there’s a hole in it and people just don’t plug the hole. My main point being is I’m sick of people saying let’s fix the planet and all this shit and this whole big movement and trying to convince everyone in charge to do something about it and not realizing they won’t and have more important things to worry about. We might have “listened” to them and done some things here and there but it’s always been undone by something else."

The thing is we can’t fix the problem at all because we are not willing to stop the things that have caused the problem in the first place.

It’s not the the fact is if she’s Into me or not as with all of the women I have interacted with on dating websites we don’t get past 3 messages. It’s the fact that they don’t bother to see things through. I’ve noticed pretty much that all of the profiles tend to say almost the same thing if not a little different. They all say they want someone who will pay attention, can hold a conversation and so on. I’m trying to get to know them and not just date them right off the bat as I would like to be friends first and then proceed from there if anything happens to happen. I’m not a person to use stupid corny pickup lines as I just don’t see them as the correct thing to do and instead I want to have a normal conversation with the other person but again it doesn’t go past 3 messages because they end up “ghosting” me. I don’t understand why these women say they want something and then when they get that something they run away, it just baffles the shit out of me. All of the situations I have been in are complete and utter bullshit and I don’t see why people can’t you know be people. Call it bad luck or whatever it just is all stupid. I want people to act like people and act there age but honestly I guess that’s asking for to much."

I should give some more Info as to what I do in those types of situations. I’m not sending them multiple messages in the same day or even within a 5 min span as it’s just one text and that’s it and then I would wait for a response. If they don’t message me back that day it’s fine as I assume they are busy so I would start up the conversation again the next day by sending them 1 message. I’m not bombarding there inbox or doing anything to even warrant them ghosting me as the messages are just a typical “hey how ya doing” type.

Edit-and even if any of what I do actually does give them a reason enough to ghost which is just a simple hello then I don’t really see that person as an adult and instead a child. Sorry for the long reply’s and shit but this whole thing just really annoys me."
dating_advice,f0naec1,t1_f0n9lzg,1568764841.0,What’s your definition of double and triple texting? To my understanding it would be sending a message 2 or three times within the span of 5 min.  I don’t believe that texting someone after a day is double or triple texting but I could be wrong.
dating_advice,f0n9173,t1_f0n7iqg,1568763787.0,Yea I completely understand that women get bombarded with messages but still it’s not difficult to take 15 seconds to say “sorry I’m not interested” and even if they have let’s say 100 people trying to message them so it would about 25 min but then there’s the beauty of copy and paste you know and that cuts it down to at least 2-5 min for those one people to get the “sorry but I’m not interested” message. I just don’t think it’s acceptable behavior to ghost someone when you can always spare time.
dating_advice,f0n8j9o,t3_d5oyud,1568763405.0,Them not wanting to “hurt” my feelings so they ghost me I mean to me that’s just not even a plausible excuse. I’m an adult I can handle rejection and shit.  I see ghosting someone as childish behavior.
TrueOffMyChest,eztvvin,t1_eztvctl,1568139804.0,Yea it does hurt and I was waiting for them to reply to me but I wasn’t constantly looking at my phone or anything it was just in my mind. The fact that they couldn’t spare 15 seconds just really shocks me. I personally expect people to send reply’s when they get the chance as 15 seconds doesn’t impact someone’s day to an extreme but that’s just me.
TrueOffMyChest,eztv3ad,t1_eztuttq,1568139304.0,Yea that’s pretty much the same thing I’m thinking. I believe if you really care about someone you would always make time for them no matter how small that time is. I’ve honestly lost a lot of faith and respect for them.

I don’t want to accept her behavior even though that’s what I end up doing most of the time but I just don’t want to end a 10 year friendship. There’s a lot of other details that would explain what is going on but it’s a lot of stuff. She hasn’t always been like this and only started acting this way recently within the last 2-3 years. I’ve been constantly going back and forth if I should end the friendship or not but I’m still holding out hope that we can just talk things through but it doesn’t look like that at the moment.

I’m also being stubborn in the sense that I don’t want to throw a 10 year friendship away. I don’t feel happy or comfortable or anything with the way she’s acting and I see it as childish and immature.

As of right now I’m still holding our hope that we can talk things through whenever they decide to talk to me. As of now we haven’t been speaking for about a week. I have tried to figure out what is wrong but eventually just said “I don’t know if I did or said something to hurt or upset you but when you are ready to talk you reach out to me as I don’t want to keep messaging you and make things escalate. I don’t want to give up on the friendship entirely as we have been friends for 11 years but if they come back and talk to me and act like everything is normal I’m basically going to tell them how their behavior is not ok and is down right childish.
Advice,ewsewne,t3_cpy6rl,1565726134.0,"Thank your the advice this really helped! As of right now said person hasn’t spoken to me in a week for whatever reason. I know they are upset with me but the last thing I said to them was “I’ll try and talk to you tomorrow” as to me they seemed busy because they kept opening my messages and just never responding. I am hurt by the whole thing as I care about this person a lot but they have been doing this crap for the past 3 years. Said person is 25 years old and is ghosting/ ignoring me like they are a teenager or something. It’s all quite frustrating. I don’t want to completely give up on the friendship as we have been friends for 11 years now and I am holding out hope that they will get to me and will maybe want to talk about everything but if they just come back to me like everything is fine I’m going to let them know how their behavior is not right and just childish.

Edit* the last thing I said to them was actually this-I don’t know if I did or said something to hurt or upset you but when you are ready to talk you reach out to me as I don’t want to keep messaging you and make things escalate."

Other than this everything between us is fine but I mean that’s because said person barely makes any effort to speak to me and I’m always the one to initiate a conversation and am putting 90% of the effort towards maintenance this friendship with little to nothing in return so I guess that would be why we don’t have any other issues is because we don’t talk. I’m sorry I gotta a little side tracked there. I think there is a reason they are like this and I think I know the reason why but I can’t/ don’t want to go into it because it is very private and person for them. They weren’t always this bad when it comes to replying in general but even with the thing that happened that I think caused said person to act this way is in no way any type of excuse.

depression,esb49i9,t1_esb3igz,1561777677.0,"It’s a long story but I’ll try to shorten it the best I can. I had always texted my friend every day as that’s Just what I did. I always mentioned to them that if I’m ever talking to you to much or bothering you in anyway to please let me know and I’ll be understanding and give you some space. I have said this multiple times in the past 3 years when this all apparently started happening but they however have always said “no you don’t bother me”, “text me whenever you want” or I love it when you text me, I like reading the messages you send me. There have also been times when I would just get a feeling in my gut that I would be bothering them so I would just ask them to make sure and they would always tell me “no you’re not bothering me” so I would just continue because I had no reason to just not believe what they say. It turns out that I have been bothering them quite much but have never told me otherwise. They basically said “you message me so much that it makes me not want to talk to you a lot of the time so that why I’m distant and sometimes don’t talk to you for days to weeks on end”. This hurt me a lot as I have always said if I’m ever bothering you just let me know. Then not talking to me at times for days to weeks on end would bother me because I would notice that they are talking to others. They told me it was just because “I suck at replying” or “I’m busy with work” to which I was understanding of but then I would just notice them talking and hanging out with their other friends for days to weeks on and and could even bother to give me like a 10-15 second message just saying “I’ve been hanging out with friends I’ll talk to you later”. Up to that point I had no reason to not believe something they told me but now I just don’t know anymore. I’ve tried to explain and defend myself but they pretty much played it out as “it’s your fault and you should be able to read my mind and know what I truly mean even though I’m telling you everything is ok and nothing is wrong when things actually are”."

It is their normal behavior but at the same time it’s not. They can talk perfectly normal with their other friends but a lot of the times it just seems like they are  not as invested in having a normal conversation with me or that much invested in our friendship. Me and this friend have I guess you can say a history with each other in the sense that we have had to talk about this and similar issues multiple times and they just don’t put any effort into changing. Most our conversation are completely one sided and that one sidedness being me. I’m not trying to change our relationship either we are just friends and nothing more. Also it’s not that they don’t have anything to say I Just think they are not good conversationalists.
Advice,eqt5slk,t1_eqt4buv,1560302974.0,I’ve given my friend nothing but time. It’s actually quite sad when I think about it. I’m always the one to initiate a conversation and they rarely do. If I were to just shoe screen shots of the texts from back and forth it’s 90% me talking.  I don’t really want to find a new friend because we have been friends for almost 11 years now. Every time I try to explain things of how she doesn’t really contribute to a conversation and how it bothers me they get really defensive and I can’t properly explain myself so I guess I just kinda stopped trying because I don’t want to keep getting into fights with them.
Advice,eqt5jyt,t1_eqt47a3,1560302785.0,That’s what I was thinking. There have been other instances of similar situations happening. The only thing is I can’t even explain myself to them because they don’t understand and it’s not because they are stupid or anything but they just simply don’t understand what I’m trying to say.
Advice,eqt5az1,t3_bzkqwd,1560302587.0,"I mean there was no way for me to walk away unless I was willing to walk off the boat. I did try to start up the  conversation afterwards maybe like 5-10 min later. It just didn’t go well, I would ask a question like “man the weather is so nice out don’t you agree” and they at least to me would not try to continue the conversation. They would just give a typical “yea” response. I don’t find myself being needy as I’m just trying to talk to said person because we rarely rarely see each other and when we do I want to make the most of my time with them. They know that I’m ok with them telling me that if they don’t want to talk at the moment or something like that but that was not said.

-edit
Also I don’t believe I ambushed them with my thoughts as I asked them if they could spare a few minutes to talk. This happened much later in evening."
Advice,eqt4tkj,t3_bzkqwd,1560302202.0,I do get where you are coming from but I was trying to get the conversation to move forward and when they said “just looking” to me at least it does not move the conversation forward and at that point I just don’t know what to say because to me they don’t seem to be interested in the conversation itself and that hurts me a lot. If they didn’t want to talk all they had to do was say “I don’t really want to talk right now” and I would completely understand and that person knows to do this as well.
Advice,eqsv5wj,t3_bzbb4t,1560294648.0,Just plan your stuff out. Make an itinerary and keep track of your expenses. If you do all this just go have fun.
Advice,eqsuzyp,t1_eqssnyu,1560294522.0,Thank you for the ideas it’s much appreciated!
Advice,eqsuyl3,t3_bzbwa3,1560294493.0,I’m in your exact and I mean exact same boat. Everything you said I’m also dealing with. The best thing at least in my opinion is if you can tolerate that person and you care about that person just continue as you are now but try to talk with other friends more and hang out with other people. Just keep yourself busy and try not to worry about it.
offmychest,ephstwh,t3_buucw2,1559230694.0,Thank you. I knew that our body can hold our stress but I was genuine very surprised at how I felt in a sense “reborn” and very confused why I was tearing up. I am actually feeling a lot better due to this massage!

relationship_advice,eoejo59,t3_brhq4c,1558498419.0,You should never ignore your gut feeling since it’s like a 6th sense. I want to say at least 7/10 times my gut feeling had always been right and I never ignore it. Never ignore your gut feeling ever again my dude.
