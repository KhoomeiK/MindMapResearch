first he screams for all these ICU beds and ventilators - scaring the beejesus out of us - and never used them. but then makes them apart of his metrics system for reopening, so now counties need the icu beds again. 

then he says we need a vaccine or therapy to get out of this... well umm, last i heard there are some pretty decent therapies out there.. remdesvir and hydroxy for some... not 100% but works still. just like any other medication \*can't expect 100% efficacy but surely does work for many

then says we need to flatten the curve - we flatten it - then says it has to drop alot - it's dropping but still extends the lockdown 

then he makes this executive order to send covid positive elderly folks - the most at risk - back into private nursing homes. do you know what kind of old people are in nursing homes? dementia, Alzheimers ... people who cannot follow directions and need 24/7 care. 

then he puts each county into a dystopian hunger games-like competition to meet impossible metrics that will put some places on lockdown until august 

then he finally realizes how utterly dirty and filthy the MTA is - like give me a break NYC has always smelled like piss and been covered in trash now more than ever bc of de blasio.
