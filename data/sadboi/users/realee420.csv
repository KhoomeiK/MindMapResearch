I’d add a few extra things to the webcam section because I’ve seen many people overlook these:

-	Figure out a great angle for your webcam. Don’t have your face take up the whole screen, I’ve seen people who have their webcam too close to their face and it is just annoying and maybe even “disgusting” in the terms that you can even see the fucking grease on their foreheads on a hot summer day.
-	Try and plan your room for streaming. Don’t make the background too cluttered (if you don’t have a green screen behind you) as it is distracting.
-	Minimize direct light sources, they can fuck up the quality and can physically hurt viewers (some exaggeration) to see your webcam."

It’s still one of the best (if not the best) simracing experiences out there. It’s not cheap we all know but spending a 100 usd a month for your hobby is not that huge of an amount for an adult.


Honestly the best example is still movie tickets. You pay around 20 bucks to see a movie which you enjoy for 2-3 hours (+ snacks?) but when you buy something like a game, track, car it keeps you busy for much longer.

Y’all need to understand these studios have full-on financial departments and they constantly watch reports and statistics. They bank on the fact that there are whales who buy every overpriced shit. If these things were like 5 bucks, you would need to get 4 people to buy it instead of just 1.


Companies work for profit regardless if you like it or not. Having these overpriced shit give us free content for the game. Skins, etc do not influence the gameplay by 1 bit. Regardless if the game is F2P or not, spending 20 bucks on a skin is bonkers (looking at Fortnite as well).

I stopped playing CoD4 after a while it wasn’t my kind of stuff. CoD5 gave me a glimpse of hope that I might return to competitive CoD in WW2 settings but while it was a great game it wasn’t CoD2. I played a TON of MW2 but only casually then I skipped the following games up until BO4. I hated that game with all my heart with the retarded operators and their BS skills. 


Finally this is a CoD that brings me back a little bit of CoD2 feeling, I don’t know why but it does. I think the slower pace did good for this game. This battle pass system and cross platform finally fixed the issues PC CoDs have had since MW2 due to DLCs and shit (splitting up the playerbase way too hard). I love this game and I don’t regret a single penny spent on it.


I also understand that newer, younger generations grew up with really fast paced CoDs and three lane maps but this franchise was so much more than that. I’m glad we got back to the roots."

iRacing,fmbj4uv,t1_fmbizee,1585927400.0,Thanks but once 30 minute passes can I leave the session? Or shall I just alt tab and let it disconnect me?
iRacing,fmb7hko,t1_fm97gcv,1585920312.0,"1.	Once I could try anything else than a Mazda I couldn’t go back. It’s so slow and it seems pretty boring to me. But everyone is different, you might love it.
2.	 Skip Barber. I’ve read that the paid tracks usually get in rotation for 2-3 seasons.
3.	 I use G29 myself and FFB is great. Ofcourse a Fanatec would be better but it costs a ton more so...
4.	iRacing is probably the best racing game for online races. It’s also the most populated. After playing it you really can’t/don’t want to play any other sim but that might be just me."
iRacing,flwy6gt,t1_flww2cs,1585569593.0,"In Skippy around 1.8k iRating and B3.6 SR there are tons of dudes who go insane quali laps. Their race pace is usually off and once I catch up to them or overtake I have to be so fucking cautious because they are usually aggressive and take huge risks because they feel like they are the hot shit because of one good qualifying lap and everyone else is shit.


Running good lap times alone on the track is entirely different than racing. In real races you often can’t take the optimal racing line and these people usually have no fucking idea about driving any line except the most optimal one and they end up overdriving the car into you in corners."
iRacing,flwxtwu,t1_flvmfiq,1585569250.0,"This shit happens all the time on skippy. Phillip Island Lap 2 turn 1 everyone tries to floor through, 2-3 cars crash, I lift so I can avoid them and I get cars mounting me from behind creating a massive crash."
iRacing,flgrgu0,t1_flgojfe,1585148868.0,Cheers for the detailed answer. I know it’s a challenge and I want to master it but I think I have enough challenges on my hand with the Benz GT3. Added traffic just makes it even harder to master the car
iRacing,fldbn76,t1_flceu2g,1585061143.0,Meanwhile in my Skippy races people can’t even go 3 wide in a fucking straight without crashing or pushing someone into the grass.
iRacing,fld68sn,t1_fld5u0r,1585057588.0,I know it sounds great in theory but regardless where I’m at in SR and iRating people don’t know or don’t care about that faster cars should do the most of the job and not the other way around. Plus I don’t want to spend my weekday evenings and weekends filing protests after almost every goddamn race. This may sound harsh but ever since GTE has been introduced to D class there are too many idiots in fast cars. It was a horrible decision on the dev team’s part to put a GTE car into D class.
iRacing,flczpiq,t1_flcxbyh,1585052470.0,I know I don’t HAVE to let them by immediately but if I don’t want to get punted it’s better to let them go even if losing time while doing so.
iRacing,flczl3a,t1_flcx0vq,1585052361.0,"Yeah Sebring wasn’t this chaotic, but considering how narrow that track is as well there was some close calls."
iRacing,flcwhi1,t1_flcw974,1585049300.0,Yeah I’m gonna give it one last shot this week. Lime Rock was very very stressful to say the least.
iRacing,flcwcms,t1_flcw60v,1585049157.0,"It becomes my problem when he pushes me off track or gives me race ending damage or makes me pit to repair.


No offense but you seriously overestimate other racers’ attitude. What’s even more annoying is that races happen every 2 hours and I only have time for 2 IMSA / night and if I get smoked in any of them it’s infuriating."
iRacing,flcw8v9,t1_flcvfwl,1585049044.0,Yeah I want to avoid getting damage that’s why I rather let them go even on unsafe parts of the track. Otherwise they just go straight up my ass the whole lap and try to divebomb me every fucking corner and going 2 wide in narrow corners. Maybe only Lime Rock is this shit in IMSA but it was almost the same case on Sebring.
iRacing,flcw4tm,t1_flcuuc8,1585048923.0,I’m know I’m meant to get lapped but how many times it occurs is what annoys me. Sure in theory it sounds good that they will overtake when safe but most of the time it’s not the case. I’ve been divebombed at the chicane on Lime Rock by GTEs many times forcing me to pit and essentially losing positions.
iRacing,fla5qbv,t1_fla59va,1584977199.0,"Yeah I meant as if you wanted to play all those cars you would have to pay for them all. Consider it 120 USD plus tax, monthly membership fee of iRacing + the effort to get to a license where you can actually race F1 cars... it would be a hard pass even for the most fanatic simracers imo. It’s easier and cheaper to get used to the shitty physics of Codemasters F1 and buy it on sale every year for 20-30 euros."
iRacing,fla4mhs,t1_fla47f2,1584976520.0,"Yeah, Open Wheel is not even the most popular series in iRacing (comparing it to ovals and GT series). Plus the payment model iRacing has would be horrible for F1: you would have to spend 10x12 bucks to have all the F1 cars every season. Plus it’s not just the model they’d have to make for the cars but whole ton of aero physics and shit. It simply doesn’t fit into iRacing.


However I would LOVE to get Formula E cars in iRacing. That could be done as the cars are the same (I might be wrong here though)."
iRacing,fl9p4ui,t1_fl9oyfr,1584964995.0,"iRacing already has an F1 car but the highest license is required for it and it’s real fucking hard to setup the car in a proper way. Almost nobody plays it, even IRL F1 drivers rather play GT3/GTE/F3 series.


I’d love an F1 game which is somewhere halfway between Codemasters F1 and iRacing."
iRacing,fl9ocuq,t1_fl9o58q,1584964200.0,"They will never make a real simulator of the F1 game. Casual people are their target audience. Most people just want to chill in the couch with a controller in hand and play as Hamilton/Leclerc etc and win races with plenty of assists on.


One thing they could do is not make F1 rights exclusive, so we could have a real sim made for us by someone else."
AskReddit,fl9h0rw,t1_fl9g5w2,1584955348.0,Maybe she wanted to know a reliable brand? On the other hand I think she implied she wants the doc to fuck her lol
iRacing,fl9gnc4,t1_fl9ccah,1584954849.0,I used to run default livery on every car for a lot of time even though I practiced a ton. I just didn’t care changing it but now that I think about it people might have been more careful around me in races.
iRacing,fl9gk1d,t1_fl84wnu,1584954727.0,Maybe that’s why I got top10s with my Monster livery Skippy because people just rather let me pass. Ever since I changed to a McLaren livery racing got harder 🤔
iRacing,fl6pvk9,t1_fl62khb,1584879384.0,"You would be surprised. I race IMSA with GT3 around 1.7k iRating and C3.5 SR and it’s insane how many people are unable to safely overtake in GTEs. Just because someone can go fast qualy and have good avg times with barely any traffic is an entirely different thing than overtaking and racing in general. Be careful even when getting lapped, I usually rather slow down on straights and let faster cars go that kinda gives you a higher chance of not crashing out."
Coronavirus,fl22bba,t1_fl145k5,1584741353.0,"Do live streams either on Twitch or YouTube. I'm sure your fans would be happy to help (if they can) or you may even gain new fans! Also maybe make content that would make people subscribe or pay extra money for. It's not impossible. It's different than what you are used to, but musicians certainly can make at least a bit of money from streaming. For example even Lindsey Stirling is doing a live concert stream at 12 PM PST tomorrow  (I don't know if for free or not), but you could do something like that as well.

Wish you the best!"

AskReddit,fkicwbm,t3_fikjbd,1584217040.0,"Coke. Did it like 4-5 times and I loved it. I was energetic, confident and hyped and I could drink so much and felt so great and had the best parties in my life on coke. Had to call it quits so I don’t get addicted.



Also morphine. I had a surgery and I could self manage it with some limits (few drops every 10 minutes) and it was the best feeling in the world. My whole body felt like a soft... pillow? And it was euphoric like rainbow flowing through my veins. It was 12 years ago and I still hold it as one of my best drug experiences."
