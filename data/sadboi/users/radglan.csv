mentalillness,fipxx4w,t3_f8zd1p,1582627152.0,I usually listen to some music or video that reminds me of some best and happy times from past before the trauma and it helps closing eyes thinking maybe I'm still in that happy moment with those good people and I just let the good memories take over my thoughts slowly and then do something distracting
mentalillness,fipxsh6,t3_f8sqyo,1582626963.0,it happens to me and I sometimes feel like someone else in my body but I do something distracting and engaging and it gets fine
mentalillness,fipxpvk,t3_f95dk5,1582626857.0,maybe recognise the patterns and work to solve the issue that's causing it?
