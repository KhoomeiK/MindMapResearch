TrueOffMyChest,fnth4uv,t3_g3l070,1587241546.0,"I actually feel sorry for Americans that come a low social economic status. In Australia you be anyone you want to be and you social status doesn’t define you. We have HECS for free university loans. Caped at a $100 000, unless studying PhD. Not to mention some free tafe courses. We have Medicare that covers almost all medical cost for all Australians. In my professional opinion as an ICU nurse some Australians however take this for granted. Every Australian can eventually own a house. You get $20,000 in Australia to help build a new house. For first home buyers anyway. 18 weeks paid maternity leave for any part time worker. 2 weeks paid father leave to bond with new bubs.  10 days a year personal leave

CsectionCentral,fnoi8p1,t3_g2yxy4,1587125816.0,"I honestly had a baby that was 95 % percentile. Anything over 90 should be c-section. I had 3/4 degree tear only diagnosed with 2 nd degree. Found out after 6 months of Chronic pain. I was unable to sit straight very painful breastfeeding or doing basic task. The MRI read I had pundentle nerve damage. Which was why I was incontient early post partumt and Dislocated coccyx . It will take 12 + months to heal. I couldn’t have intercourse for 6 months and it was still painful. I now may have a minor prolapse. I was very unlucky. I was fit and healthy. I now have PPD and anxiety due to traumatic birth. My baby airways obstructed, was treated for sepsis, interment bradycardia, heart mummer and dehydration. What makes it worse I am a critical care nurse. I asked if baby was too big they said it was fine. The nurse lied when baby airways obstructed but the doctor saw my baby  blue. My baby spent 11 days in special care nursery. I find it very hard to trust anyone and is nervous to do it all again. I am 12 weeks pregnant now but luckily the specialist said I am only for c-section. She said the recovery will be very easy in comparison. I am writing this down for awareness and support to other women. It was hard to find similar cases. That is just my story.
