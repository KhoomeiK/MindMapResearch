AskReddit,fmq55fm,t3_fwow7v,1586293054.0,"So tired. My husband, I and our 15 month old have all been sick (believe it was coronavirus but can't get a test so don't know for sure). I think we are over the worst now but I am so exhausted from lack of sleep, worrying and waiting for the worst to happen. Now my little one has her sleep cycle completely messed up and I have no idea how to get it back on track. Not even sure if she is completely over the virus. So very tired all the time. Very grateful that we are okay though and wish everyone else could be as lucky."

ptsd,fjp03ve,t3_fe9esl,1583538616.0,"All the time. Usually I ask myself if the concern is something I would normally be worried about or if it just seems like a bigger problem in my head at the moment. If it isn't then I wait and make an assessment of the situation when I am feeling more level headed. In saying that, I am not someone who likes heat of the moment arguments anyway."
AskReddit,fhx5591,t3_f54f73,1581944923.0,"People who help you because they want to help you and not because they feel you owe them something for it and use that as emotional blackmail (""I did this for you so you MUST do this for me or you are ungrateful""), especially when you have no other choice but to accept their help. Basically I am so grateful for the people who didn't take advantage of the power they have over you when you are poor, homeless and desperate."
