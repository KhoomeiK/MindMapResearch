ptsd,fb7yh73,t3_ebv7px,1576602196.0,"People don't know how to handle other people in pain, especially parents dealing with a child in pain. It can be really common for this type of thing to happen. On New Years last year I raped. My dad accused me of treating him like an ATM machine after the fact and abandoned me. He hasn't spoken to me in almost a year now. That honestly effects me just as much as the actual traumatic experience did. My mother is a crazy alcoholic and has so much buried, unprocessed trauma. I stayed with her for a large part if this year because I was unemployed due to my PTSD, and she constantly yelled at me for being depressed, etc... My point of this comment is that parents can be people that especially don't know how to deal with a child's pain. There are no acceptable excuses for their behavior, but just knowing that can help me feel a little better. Today is my birthday and my dad texted me happy birthday.... hasn't spoken to me in almost a year after abandoning me.... and texts me like literally nothing happened while I'm still suicidally depressed with terrible ptsd. Fuckin parents, man. They're difficult. What happened to you is valid, and just because someone had it ""worse"" does not invalidate the suffering you experienced. Someone always has it worse. Anyone who uses that as an excuse to not feel your own emotions is being a pos that doesn't understand trauma. I just don't talk to my mom about my feelings anymore, it's not worth it. That's what I have my therapist and chosen family (friends) for. Best of luck to you. Sorry for the ramble/rant."

It takes courage to make a choice like that and seek the help you need to try and get better. I was unemployed for almost a year after my traumatic experience, and taking that time off really really helped. You can't function when you're in constant flight or fight mode. Finding a good therapist helped so much! Allow yourself to be mediocre, to not be fully present with others and with life, take the time you need to heal. Uni can be super difficult, I can't imagine having to do that course load with PTSD. I would have dropped out for sure. Just know you can always go back and finish later. You're making the right decision for yourself. <3"
ptsd,f9rg8qb,t3_e6dagd,1575575895.0,"I am so sorry. Those feel like empty words. My ptsd is also from rape, so I empathize a little. Finding a good therapist has helped me a lot so far, but it's still a constant battle. I'm glad you got away from him. It's not your fault. <3"
ptsd,f9rfcl5,t3_e6kx9q,1575575542.0,"YES. Thank you so much for bringing this up. I feel so stupid trying to date new people or make new friends because I feel so dumb, uninteresting, and unable to hold deep/intelligent conversations most of the time. There are moments where my intelligence shines through, but it feels rare. Hoping this is something I can improve with time and healing work."
