But, I did make it to the 79 new years eve on Oakland, memorable weekend. Beginning of the 'parking lot scene' atmosphere. Almost all of mne have been at Oakland, with other shows here and there. Even sold grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches at some.

It can't be a blanket denial, the tenant has to cooperate at some point. But, a 24 notice IS NOT Carte blanche entry to a rental. A tenant has to have a valid reason, messy isn't one of them.

desmoines,fqhue1a,t3_gix7u4,1589384760.0,"Call legal aid at Drake College. They have, online, the tenant/landlord rights and responsibilities. 

Just because it's in the lease, doesn't mean it's legal. I believe 24 hour notice is a state law. You may not be able to waive it, unless YOU want to. And it may not be intrusive, which is rather vague. 

I'd say showing during a pandemic 'could' be considered intrusive. 

Take pictures now, argue most  damage as fair wear and tear. Make them PROVE that YOU did the damage and that it was NOT like that when you moved in.

Without prior pictures, their case will be difficult too. Stand your ground. 
Landlords expect you to fold and give in.    

For future reference, before moving a single piece of furniture at the new place... 

Take pictures of every wall, ceiling, floor, in and behind appliances, bathroom, tub, toilet and the mechanicals. Do a WRITTEN inventory of each room. Holes, nails, broken windows, slides, burn marks, Anything not correct. 

Handwritten, or typed doesn't matter. Then either email, but, preferably snail mail with a delivery confirmation, about $6-ish.

Nothing with an attitude, just the facts. 

This will put the landlord on notice that you'll be expecting the deposit back. 

Lifelong renter for over 40 years, I can't remember not getting a deposit back in over 30 years and this is how I do it. 

Landlords prey on the ignorant. Don't let them. Call Drake Legal Aid. You have more power than you think. Good luck."
