unpopularopinion,f00sgx6,t1_f00rmiw,1568305874.0,"Accidents happen, rape happens, etc. That's great you're pro life and all but I dont like the government telling me what I can and can not do with my body. I'm quite happy I have the option to get an abortion because I hate kids and never ever want one. Some women get abortions because their symptoms are extreme and cant function as a human being and need to get an abortion. Some need to get an abortion due to the fact the mother might DIE at childbirth. But I guess because a child comes into the picture, the mothers life becomes obsolete? Yes it is true some women dont want the baby as it is in my case, but most have more serious conditions and other reasons to get an abortion."
unpopularopinion,f00ql8g,t3_d3a54u,1568305175.0,If they closed down planned parenthood then where will women go for safe abortions?? I'm proud to live in a state that has care readily available to women who need it and it's important abortions happen safely. Also planned parenthood does other services other than abortions. At least the fetuses are not getting thrown away but being sold for research.
unpopularopinion,f00q5pb,t1_f00pro9,1568305002.0,"Agreed, I'm getting a stem cell procedure done for my back and one of the things they inject is this FDA regulated product that's called Affix which is found in a mother's womb when carrying a child because it promotes growth and helps the stem cells do that they gotta do."

I read something where he listened and learned some techniques from Gene Krupa and another drummer from the big band era. He took techniques from other drummers and made his own style. As someone said earlier, Queen definitely wouldn't be Queen without Rog. And I know some people here along with myself have seen Queen tour with Adam Lambert and Roger is still a fantastic drummer. But hey that's your opinion and you're entitled to it but this really isnt the subreddit. r/unpopularopinions might be better."

He gives me space yes, but hes at the point of being annoyed because he does not believe anxiety to be a thing. Hes told me to calm down and he is frustrated because I dont listen when he says calm down and it isnt that easy. Accept the anxiety and just try to be there for her and be as caring as you can. If she decides to seek help from a therapist or anything support it 100%. I'm sure you would since you love her but just try to not get angry when shes cold too. That's the best advice I can give, I hope it helps some!"

Shes not a damn queen or anything. I saw her live and I left early with my mom because we were honestly bored.
