AskReddit,f458gkp,t3_djabmx,1571368746.0,I had some traumatic events in my life & if I blackout or drink too much and something triggers me I have psychotic breaks and start doing things that could end up harming me or leading to bad things... plus it makes me feel like shit.
eating_disorders,f427w5a,t3_dj7zx4,1571328529.0,"Oh my goodness.. I’m so sorry this happened to you. I haven’t experienced this with any therapist but most definitely with physicians just telling me that my BMI isn’t “that low” or showing me my weight when I don’t want to see it, just really acting like I was being weird and it made me uncomfortable."

EatingDisorderHope,f3hljn1,t3_dgx5bb,1570925377.0,"I think you do have one. I have anorexia nervosa and I sometimes binge. I actually thought that I was sick with something else and a doctor told me she thought I had an ED and should get help for it (I’m so happy she told me that) and since then I’ve been seeing a nutritionist and therapist. I’m actually even thinking about going to an in patient treatment bc I’ve realized a lot of why I have the thoughts and habits I do is because of past trauma. 
A lot of my habits are the same as yours and it’s honestly really nice to have people helping me now, I feel less crazy! 

I hope that helped, good luck!!"

eating_disorders,f204zdm,t3_damg23,1569855343.0,I deal with this a lot just not wanting to eat. I just try to drink protein shakes as much as I can when I’m not consuming actual food but keep trying your hardest to eat food <3
EatingDisorderHope,eyk22os,t1_eyekfpo,1567134572.0,I hadn’t even thought about it being an issue at all until someone I haven’t seen in two years messaged me on Facebook about 2 months ago and asked if I was okay because I was looking super small. And then this past month my bf mentioned he thought I might have one and my best friend told me too so it has opened my eyes to a lot. Mainly this week has just opened my eyes to a lot with it but I have talked to my parents about it and I have an appointment with a therapist and nutritionist set up next Friday.
EatingDisorderHope,eyk1w5i,t1_eyefnrv,1567134425.0,I haven’t been diagnosed yet. I just went to the doctor with some issues thinking it was something and they said I’m very underweight w low blood pressure and they think I have one. I am set up to go see a therapist and doctor next week. It is a mix of both. I find myself not interested in eating but when I become hungry finding reasons I shouldn’t eat.
