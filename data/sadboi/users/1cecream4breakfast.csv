Instead of Kate’s only path to victory being weight loss, Kate could triumph by healing emotionally from all the shit people have done to her and things she has suffered from (even if just perceived) because of her weight? I think the latter situation is a highly probable route at this point, and it would be much more satisfying for me as the survivor of an ED and for many viewers I think. 

I do not see them having younger Kate’s actress playing older Kate. Yes the roles are all split up (except for Jack, Rebecca, and Miguel, I believe). But they don’t split the roles up for weight. It’s just due to age. Jack, Rebecca, and Miguel keep their roles in the entire timeline because they are adults in all timelines. They aren’t going to have adult Kate played by a different actress. She’s already an adult and doesn’t need a second actress to play adult Kate."

Intentional weight loss is almost always temporary (look it up, it’s true—no one goes on a million diets because it’s fun, it’s because diets generally don’t work). 

Having a son with a disability and an emotionally absent husband is also a huge character arc.

In the meantime, keep a log of all the times you called, left messages, etc. If you don’t get movement within a day or two for an issue this big, find a tenants’ rights group in your area. They know local law and will probably be better able to help nudge things along. 

A burst pipe is an emergency and it should be treated as such so you’re right to be frustrated.

Also can’t tell from your post or recent posts where you’re from, but is it possible the burst pipe is cold-related?

Mixing up the prices forces you to scroll through tons of stuff and hopefully (in their minds) buy something a little pricier than what you’d planned. 

As someone else said, you can enter the challenge without using keys, and see if you have what you need pretty easily. You don’t use keys until you hit submit.

Starting something you like for a room sounds like a cool idea and I don’t see why they shouldn’t add that in. Perhaps having to scroll through items *again* to find that piece you saw a few minutes ago still increases your chances of spending more money. 

In case you weren’t aware, the Undo/Redo buttons do work well. So if I need a red sofa and I like one of the sofas halfway down the list, I’ll tap it (ONCE) to add it to the room. If I see a different one later, I’ll tap that. I can hit undo/redo as many times as I like to switch between items. However, if you check 3 different couches and screw around with your chairs, then you’ll have to undo past the chairs, and if you redo a couch, you’ll have to go find the chairs again unless you bought them."
