I was really watching this intently with the preregistration, but as soon as I got in and realized this was another broken GUMI gacha game I got out. GUMI is continuing to do irreparable damage to square Enix's lasting legacy."

FinalFantasy,ew0agyb,t3_bnecg2,1564981079.0,"I went ""f*CK this noise"" mode. After getting wiped twice, I went back to O'akas brother and bought Yuna and aurons anti-zombie equipment (blessed bracer/ring) and on the way back used every Aeon enough to bank their overdrive. From there, have Lulu in the first group to use bio, use hastega with Tidus to make sure Yuna can go as often as possible. Mega Flare, Diamond Dust and Thor's Hammer brought him down to the last 10k.. I even had time to throw in Kimarhi and Rikki for the exp, and Wakka with the dark/silence switch hitter. He geared up for Total Annihilation, but Aurons got to him first. 

It takes a little grinding but get the blessed gear. As long as you keep Yuna running at 100% the fight is a cakewalk. My 12 year old self is proud. üòú"
depression,evrtebt,t3_anh7tv,1564717937.0,"Today, I admit, I'm in hell. But in that pain I want to remind people that hell is, not in fact eternal. For anyone who reads this, I want you to know, you're tough as fuck. I don't know you, but I have love for you, hope for you, and I know if you keep trying you're gonna learn to cope with this pain that many don't understand, you can help those who feel the same. Stay tough. Fight off your demon, I believe in you more than I believe in myself. And that's something.

Edit: dumb wording."
depression,evrt0gm,t3_ckxnpe,1564717598.0,"I feel that after reading this, your ethos is being hell-bent on having a PURPOSE; to be a contributor, to be a battery to some greater working machine. But what if we don't have a purpose? What if we are to simply exist, and find our purpose along the way? 

I can't change your mind. I'm just saying, hear it out. Maybe having no purpose, other than the sake of your own experiences, is more fulfilling in the end than waiting for a REASON to keep going. 

My advice? Push that date back. You might help someone that feels the same way you do. And it might keep them going long enough to see their own light that keeps the dark back. That may be your only purpose, but that's a hell of a reason to keep going. Kill depression with hope. 

Cheering for you."

depression,evrr2fa,t3_cd0hjp,1564715950.0,"I think the hardest part of functional depression is the nihilism behind it. Im almost 30; I have a job, I have a loving wife, two dogs, I'm (for the most part) healthy; but I just don't CARE about my own well being. About anything. And there's so much shame to that because people just want to tell you it's a matter of positivity and perspective.. but with a mental condition like this it's hard to not feel robotic; being told to just lighten up is the same thing as telling a robot to grow skin. I WANT to be positive, I WANT to be integrated and in love with the world around me, I WANT to feel joy about the simple things of life. I've tried religion; I've tried pharma, I've tried the *don't sweat the small stuff* feel good books. But in the end I still wake up and groan about doing it again. 

Thanks for this post.. even if you know already, sometimes it's refreshing enough to be reminded you aren't the first."

I mean, I'm a grown-ass man playing video games on his phone, granted. But at least be honest and not misleading to your supporters, lest you leave a bitter-ass taste in the mouth of your fanbase because they have to search your rates under a telescope to find out how rare they truly are.

As long as you dispel (bring Bushido for the second round), the bonus round is a joke. As long as rain has a high elemental resistance and our beautiful siegy don't go down, and you keep breaks up from anyone (I usually use CG Lid but I needed a second attacker and the friends list is still busted AF), you'll do fine. 

If anyone needs a 1500-ish Mag Freyvia to bring along I'll keep her up for a few days. Good luck!"
