He also has a son who's a year below me and seeing them together always makes me wish he could be my dad. He's really accepting of his son's opinions, style and music taste, he even went with him to a death metal concert once. My stepfather on the other hand would just get angry at me because I had a different political opinion than him, intentionally do things he knows make me uncomfortable and then laugh at me, get irrationally angry and threaten to beat me up and made me feel like he'd ridicule me if I told him anything about myself.

AskEurope,fg479oe,t3_ewmual,1580497636.0,"Slovak - pretty much the same as Czech, understand 100%, can't speak (never had to)

German - studied in school for 6 years, not really great education, about A2 level

Polish - can understand like 50%, can't speak it at all, can communicate somewhat with Polish people when we're both speaking in our native language (slavic countries yay!) 

Out of these three German has definitely had the biggest influence on our language because of our history together, quite a lot of our slang terms come from German"
MetalMemes,fg0p9v6,t3_ew849j,1580412359.0,"According to most non-metalheads that I know there are two genres: 

Heavy metal (often called metallica) - no screaming, the stuff that your dad listens to, includes ACDC

Death metal (sometimes also called metallica, often called ""that screaming devil music"") - screaming, you should make fun of people who listen to it"
AskEurope,ffy0gys,t3_evkbjn,1580336088.0,"It definitely should. It's so hypocritical when alcohol and tobacco are legal and very much socially acceptable, and still so many people (including politicians) act like it's something horrible. Weed is not physically addictive and has less harmful effects than alcohol and cigarettes, plus it can be used to treat some mental illnesses for example. In my opinion, the war on drugs only causes harm to society and isn't productive at all. A much better approach would be legalizing drugs like weed or psychedelics and decriminalizing harder drugs. Harm reduction is much better than putting someone in jail for a bit of weed."
AskEurope,ffxzme4,t1_ffwgemp,1580335582.0,"I agree with you, and I think that this is a big problem with alcohol in the Czech Republic, it has become so normalized (the same goes for tobacco I would say) and yet the majority of people act like weed is so much worse and say that legalisation would ruin our society. I find it so hypocritical, especially since weed doesn't have as serious effects as alcohol and isn't physically addictive."

I go through cycles of sleeping till 10 for about a month, then like 2-3 weeks of waking up in the middle of the night multiple times and not being able to fall asleep. I think it was just because the week before that I couldn't sleep and also was constantly surrounded by people (that also exhausts me quite a lot). I was most likely just so tired after that that my mind just needed a break and couldn't really function properly because of that."

depression,ff2u5ur,t3_er78xc,1579524288.0,"I went through something similar a few weeks ago, even though it was nowhere as bad. 

It started with me not being able to fall asleep, I often stayed up to 3 or 3:30 am. That wasn't really a problem, even though I had to wake up at 7 for school, I could always just drink a cup of coffee and get through the day, and I slept a lot on the weekend. 

Then it changed into falling asleep at like 2 and waking up around noon (weekend), and I never sleep that long. When it got to Monday, I would go to sleep at 11 and had to wake up at 7, which would usually be more than enough, but I was super tired the next day, everything seemed foggy and I couldn't remember anything. On Tuesday it was even worse, I was so exhausted I couldn't think properly and I don't remember much from that day. 

I realized that I couldn't go on like this and pretended to be sick so my mum would let me stay at home (if I told her I thought it was because of my mental health, she would just laugh at me). I fell asleep at 10 and woke up at 3 pm, I was still really tired. The next days were the same, except I stayed up really late because I was anxious and scared of my life staying like this and having to deal with it. 

It thankfully went away on Sunday and I was able to go to school on Monday without being super tired (just the usual amount) and I could finally think straight. It was one of the most stressful things I've experienced and I'm just really happy that it's okay now."

depression,feq3k1q,t3_eqc9no,1579337153.0,"I just wish I had a friend. I'm really shit at social interactions, so that's probably why, but the last time I've had someone I would consider a friend rather than an acquaintance has been in 3rd grade, after that it was people either bullying me or kind of ignoring me. 

Because of this I find it really hard to try and make friends because I just don't know how to do it, even when at times I have the will to try. It always ends up with me talking to someone on our way from school and then they ignore me again the next day. I've given up on the thought of actually dating someone because I can't even make friends, how could I get to know someone so well they would want to date me? 

I've lost so much of my childhood because of this and I feel like an outcast since I know basically nothing about my classmates. This is the thing that makes me want to kill myself the most..."

The only things helping me get through the day are him saying ""you're a rainbow in the dark"" and the bridge in Heaven and Hell. 

Some more similar songs I love at the moment that really help me: 

Megadeth - Promises 

Megadeth - Dawn Patrol 

Dio - When a Woman Cries 

Black Label Society - Overlord 

Powerwolf - Where the Wild Wolves Have Gone 

David Bowie - Ashes to Ashes 

Black Sabbath - Walk Away 

Black Sabbath - Electric Funeral 

Guns n Roses - Don't cry 

Helloween - Keeper of the Seven Keys 

Black Sabbath - Lonely Is the World 

Dio - All the Fools Sailed Away 

Iron Maiden - The Thin Line Between Love and Hate 

Dream Theater - Octavarium 

I know nobody probably cares about this list, but I love recommending new music to others"
