Men being sexually assaulted or raped is a real problem, but people only care to bring it up when somebody talks about women going through that so they can say ""yeah but men do too."" These people don't actually care about men's mental health, they just think they can use it as a scapegoat to pretend women's mental health isn't that serious. In reality, we should be talking about how our society teaches men that they aren't supposed to have strong emotions or mental health problems, it's just that it should be had as it's own serious discussion, not as a way to distract from women going through the same thing. Whenever women talk about an issue, in this case mental health, a lot of men trivialize it, then try to make the point that it's a problem for men too, because they can't stand admitting that women face a lot of disadvantages men don't."

I'm personally of the opinion that unless somebody's in really serious financial trouble, it's a bad idea to ask for money from or give handouts to your family members. It's one thing if somebody's really struggling and needs help, but if it's for things they want and don't need, especially when you have multiple siblings, it's just going to cause problems. Giving money to your brother for totally non-essential stuff for the sole reason that you have more money than him creates the precedent that whoever has the most money somehow owes the rest of the siblings. It's your money, asking for it to use on getting something you don't need is really bad form, and doesn't really make sense. It's one thing if it's ""you have all this money for stuff you don't really need and I can't afford a house/food/utilities, can you help me out?""

Patriots,fquj8eh,t3_gku0wd,1589659820.0,"Are we still pretending that Eli Manning and Nick Foles were the reason for either of those Super Bowl wins? You could have put half of the quarterbacks in the league on those teams and the outcome wouldn't have changed. They both won Super Bowl MVP because they were the quarterbacks, but in reality, the team around Eli Manning, specifically the defenses one those two Giants super bowls, and I think the lack of success Nick Foles has had literally anywhere other than Philadelphia makes it abundantly clear that Frank Reich, and to a lesser extent Doug Pederson, were the reason for Nick Foles looking so good in that game (with an assist from Belichick benching Butler.) The Giants and Eagles won because they were really well built teams that were strong at every position and had really good coaching, not because their quarterbacks were really good. 

Beyond that, it's one of the worst arguments in football to say that a quarterback lost to another quarterback. They're never on the field at the same time. They don't face off against each other. Foles only played that well because of his coach and how good the rest of the offense was, but even on paper, Brady outplayed Nick Foles in that game. Brady threw for 505 yards, Foles threw for 373. They both had 3 touchdown passes but Foles had an interception, Brady didn't. Brady had a passer rating of 115.4, Foles had a passer rating of 106.1. (yes, I know Foles also had a touchdown reception, but nobody's actually dumb enough to give Foles the credit for that. All he did was basically not fuck up. Trey Burton did more on that play than Foles did.) It happens all the time that one quarterback plays better than the other, but the team who had lesser quarterback play wins anyway, because there are so many other factors than just which quarterback played better."

PoliticalMemes,fqskpt0,t1_fqs219o,1589610043.0,"Very well said. It's like everybody forgets that we have a system that by it's very nature, moved slowly. The only way to make things go as fast as they want is to overthrow the government and replace it with a new, less democratic one. Universal healthcare is a great idea and it's probably going to happen one day, and that will be a great day. However, I can say with a great amount of confidence that regardless of whether the president is Trump, Biden, or Bernie, that day is not going to come in the next four years, unless a biblical plague comes through and wipes out all the republican senators. 

To get universal healthcare actually implemented, you would need to not only craft a bill that every single Democrat can get on board with, which isn't an easy task on it's own, given the valid concerns about a lapse in coverage among other things, but then, you would have to convince a handful of republican senators to agree, and that's just not happening. I don't care if Bernie got into office and for 4 years did nothing but try to get universal healthcare passed, we still wouldn't have it in 2025. 

Things like universal healthcare and cancelling student loan debt are great ideas, and I don't doubt that in a 15-20 years they could get passed, after the older generation fades out and Congress becomes more run by gen x and millennials instead of baby boomers. Sometimes you just have to be okay with accomplishing whatever little change you can now, and knowing that you'll get the big picture stuff in due time if you keep pushing at it. No amount of Instagram posts about Bernie is going to get people free healthcare.

TooAfraidToAsk,fqfwagy,t1_fqfrw0y,1589332962.0,"Sure, all religions have variation, but that doesn't diminish the point. Religions preaching negative things like homophobia is a problem, because people follow it. Usually, people who are homophobic on the basis of religion didn't read the whole Bible from front to back, and pull out that one verse on their own to try demonizing gay people. They usually have that instilled in them from their church or their pastor. Beyond that, the organizations themselves tend to be tremendously flawed at best and downright corrupt at worst. Again, I'm going to use Christianity as my example because it's what I'm most familiar with. It's one thing to sit at home and read the Bible, it's another thing entirely to run an organization that teaches people, especially children, that homosexuality is wrong, and that women are meant to be subservient to men. It instills beliefs in them from a young age, tells them they'll burn forever if they disobey, and threatens excommunication from what is for a lot of people, the only community they have, if they break certain rules.

I'm not saying that every religious institution in the world is corrupt, but the structure of most religious institutions is prone to corruption, and is usually harmful. I don't know enough about the inner workings of Zoroastrianism to tell you whether I think it's harmful or not. I also don't think you can use a religion that makes up about .0025% of the population as a stand-in for organized religion. If you combine the followers of Islam and Christianity, that makes up almost half of the entire world population, and keep in mind that includes 16% of people that are not religious, so over half of religious people are either Christian or Muslim. The next highest religious population is Hinduism at 15%, and Hinduism has so many variations that are so different that you can't really judge it as a whole that easily. Some of it's harmful, but it's all really different so I can't really make a concrete statement on Hinduism. 

All I'm saying is that the concept of religious organizations like the church are inherently flawed. I take less issue with religions like Buddhism, because it's decentralized, and it isn't as strict as religions like Islam and Christianity, but more importantly, none of this has anything to do with my initial question. Literally all I'm saying right now is that the two biggest religions in the world teach harmful stuff, and that most organized religion is heavily flawed both in concept and execution. When I'm talking about organized religion I'm not even talking about the religions themselves, I'm talking about the institutions that teach them."
thewalkingdead,fqfu0hp,t1_fqfs0od,1589331668.0,"That's totally fine, you're allowed to like things that are unpopular. For me, more than anything, seasons 7 and 8 (mostly 8) are just really boring. Every episode feels kind of the same and I don't really care about what's happening in them. Most of that is because The Walking Dead is at it's best when it's a character driven story. The zombies and the threats are there, but the zombies aren't what makes it interesting. If it we're just 10 seasons of them fighting zombies and trying to survive among zombies, it would be really boring. For the first 5 seasons or so, it's a character driven story, and that works really well. Rick and Shane's standoff is one of the best moments of the show in my opinion, and it works so well because everything that's happening is a result of the human drama and there are real tangible stakes. Characters being in peril because of zombies can be interesting, which is why there are a lot of deaths from zombie bites, but the ones that stick with you all have human elements. I don't know the policy on this sub of spoilers in the replies so I won't name anybody, but the death by walker towards the end of season 2 (you know the one I'm talking about) works because of the way it impacts Andrea and Glenn, and because Carl feels responsible, so it's tied up in character based stories.

There's another death by zombie in the middle of season 8 (again, you know the one I'm talking about) that's sad, because we like the character and seeing him die is sad, but it doesn't feel earned because he was just bit out of nowhere for no reason, and it's just a really heavy handed plot device. 

The other problem as far as plot driven story in seasons 7 and 8 is that with the exception of a few good episodes where major things go down, every episode feels pretty much the same, and none of it advances the plot. Tara getting stuck at Oceanside isn't that interesting because it's plot driven, and it's just setup for something that's going to happen way in the future. Rick and Michonne looking for guns isn't that interesting because it's just an errand. It's basically just [insert characters] trying to do [insert task] but have to deal with [insert mundane obstacle.] Season 8 is worse because pretty much every episode is just a few characters not really talking much, doing general war stuff.

A lot of Islamic teachings are very harmful, and you can find a lot of the systemic problems that exist in Christianity in Islam as well. A major issue with organized Christianity that comes to mind is that a lot of churches preach homophobia, and if you look at Islam, that homophobia is preached there as well. Islamic communities have a lot of the same prejudices and issues that Christian communities have.

TooAfraidToAsk,fqfqbpj,t1_fqfldv7,1589329633.0,"I understand why it doesn't work it's just crazy to me that everybody's kind of okay with that mentality on this one topic, but if you used that mentality anywhere else you would be considered delusional. If somebody has an absolute faith that the earth is flat, and evidence doesn't matter, that person is delusional, but if somebody has an absolute faith in Christianity we're all cool with that. 

The thing that's more weird to me than that is the amount of people, religious and otherwise who think it's wrong to mention that evidence in the first place. For example, if somebody tries to explain all the evidence that these things that are talked about as fact in the Bible didn't happen, a lot of people, even people who aren't Christian will say that it's not right to diminish other people's beliefs, but it's not like that's the case in any situation other than religion. Anywhere else, if you have evidence that something isn't true, nobody's going to say that the evidence is legit and it definitely isn't true but you can't say that. Looking at it, it almost seems like somebody is about to say Santa isn't real in front of a kid whenever somebody brings up evidence like that.

It is true that it's drilled into some people that others will try to ""corrupt"" them, but it's just weird to me that as a society we're kind of just okay with that kind of cult like thinking, and we allow it to influence our government policies and the way we exist as a society.

TooAfraidToAsk,fqfoqp9,t1_fqfltv8,1589328777.0,"The fact of the matter is, when you look through the biblical story, most if not all of it has been proven false. Main thing is, evolution is a ""theory"" but it's been proven about as thoroughly as gravity at this point. In science most things are considered ""theories"" because science and English aren't really the same language. For example, scientists have found 0 correlation between vaccines and autism, and are as certain as a person can be that there is no link between vaccines and autism, but if you ask somebody in that field if vaccines cause autism, they won't tell you that vaccines don't cause autism, they'll tell you that there is no link between vaccines and autism. In science, that essentially means that there isn't one, but scientists don't really talk in absolutes because science isn't absolute, it's constantly growing and changing, so sure, evolution is a theory, but we can also be about as certain that evolution is real as we can that if I were to go up to the roof of my house and jump off, I would not fly. Technically, you can't prove that I wouldn't fly, but we're as certain as one can possibly be that I wouldn't, based on what we know about the laws of gravity.

Beyond that, there's tons of major components in the Bible that can be proven false. The most obvious one that comes to mind is Noah's Arc. Bill Nye did this thing a while ago where he debated a Christian author, I believe it was Ken Ham, and he went through all the really obvious flaws in the concept of Noah's Arc, so I'm not going to list them off but you'll find the video if you Google it. Basically, the gist is, that's another major element of Christianity that has been disproven, so what you can do is go down the list and look at all the things in the Bible and in the Christian faith that have been proven false, and at a certain point you have to look at it all and realize that if *that* much of what's in the Bible is false, it's safe to say beyond a reasonable doubt that we have about as much evidence that it's false as we do that Santa isn't real."

breakingbad,fq820uc,t1_fq7ronw,1589156887.0,"Not specifically but there was an outline. They knew where they were trying to go with the main story thread. A lot of the side stuff wasn't pre-planned but kind of by default there was an outline. When you're looking at the new trilogy, nothing was thought out. Even the four main characters. The prequel trilogy had a general outline inherently because it's a prequel trilogy. You know where your characters are starting, and for most of them you know where they're ending. Anakin is going to become Darth Vader, Palpatine is going to take over the galaxy and become Darth Sidious, Yoda and Obi-Wan are going to go into hiding, the rest of the Jedi are going to die, and Padmé is going to die before her kids are old enough to remember everything, then they're going to be sent to live with other people. That's the bare minimum of outline that you need to have for something like this, and the prequels had it by default, because everything had to end a certain way. In addition, George Lucas wrote and directed all of them, so it wasn't as important to have more specific outlines.

As for the sequel trilogy, where they could basically do whatever they wanted. There was no definite ending. On top of that, they didn't have firm plans to have one person either writing or directing all three, so they needed at least rough plans. JJ Abrams may have had an idea of how he wanted the rest of the trilogy to go after TFA, but it's clear that they didn't consult him when making TLJ, and the same goes for Rian Johnson. If they'd had one person writing and directing it would have been different, but the problem is they had JJ make the first movie, where he set up plot threads and character arcs, then they had Rian Johnson make the second movie, and didn't make sure that he followed those same plot threads and character arcs, so he completely changed course and made a movie that didn't work as a sequel for the first one, then they had JJ come back and make the third movie, and didn't have him follow Rian Johnson's plot threads and character arcs, so he made his own completely different movie that didn't work as a sequel to the previous one.

There were three really obvious ways to fix this problem.

1. Have the same person write and direct all three movies, so they could just expand upon whatever plot threads and character arcs they wanted. They already had JJ making the first one, he was in talks to make the second one, and he did make the third one, so if they were going to go this route, they should have had JJ Abrams just do all three movies, or whatever other writer/director, just as long as they had one person.

2. Exchange notes. If you're going to have different people direct the movies, you need them to be working in tandem with whoever directed the movie prior. If JJ is doing the episodes 7 and 9, and Rian Johnson is doing episode 8, then after episode 7, they should have had them exchange notes. JJ could tell Rian where he was going with the story and what he had in mind for generally where to go from there. Then Rian could have made his movie with that in mind, done his best to continue those threads, and then you would do the same thing for the last movie. I get the sense that Rian Johnson just wanted to make his own movie and didn't care what JJ did, and then JJ felt the same way making episode 9, so it could have also worked if they had both put their egos aside and just made a movie that flowed with what the previous guy had made.

3. Writers and directors aside, just map everything, or at least some things out in advance. Kind of like they do with the MCU. MCU directors kind of have free reign to make their own movies, but they also have guidelines. James Gunn wouldn't have been allowed to kill off Thanos in Guardians 2 because they knew the needed Thanos later on. Shane Black wouldn't have been allowed to turn Iron Man into a villain because there were plans for his character going forward. Likewise, JJ Abrams clearly had a plan for Snoke, so even though I don't mind Snoke getting killed in episode 8, it was actually a pretty cool moment, JJ ended up having to bring back Palpatine to fill the role that he intended for Snoke, which we can all agree was ridiculous. All they needed to do was decide generally what they wanted to do with the sequel trilogy. Decide who Rey, Finn, Kylo, and Poe are, where they want their characters and relationships to go, and what general major plot points they want to have happen. 

Had they done any of those things, we might have had at least an average sequel trilogy, but now here we are."

breakingbad,fq6xgjd,t1_fq6osjw,1589139092.0,"It's not difficult to follow, there just isn't a strong well thought out storyline through the movies. From the perspective of a writer, the new trilogy is a discombobulated mess. The weird thing is that the first two movies as stand alone movies work, but in the context of the broader story they're apart of, not so much. TFA is a well made movie, with it's flaws, but it doesn't really make sense narratively as a continuation of the story. Return of the Jedi wrapped up the narrative in a final way, so to open up the narrative again with the same characters involved doesn't really make sense, and they didn't really bother to come up with a good reason to continue the story. Otherwise, TFA as it's own narrative is fine. 

Then there's TLJ. Again, if it were a solo movie and not part of a pre-existing narrative, it's a well made movie with interesting characters and stories, but in connection with the original trilogy and TFA, it doesn't work. When you set up something in a story, there's an expectation that it's going to be paid off. It doesn't have to be paid off in the way audiences expected, but if it isn't finalized, it feels like a loose end. By choosing to disregard plot points that were set up in TFA, and ignoring the characterization, it didn't work as a sequel that existed in the same world as TFA. For example, in TFA, they set up Finn who was a really interesting character, and they set up the inner conflict of being a former stormtrooper now on the other side as the basis of his character. Going forward, as a writer tasked with continuing Finn's character arc in a satisfying way. If you watch TLJ without having seen TFA, with the exception of Poe calling him a stormtrooper, you would never know that Finn was at one point a stormtrooper, or that there was any sort of inner conflict of that nature. If you watched TFA first and are aware that TLJ is a sequel, and you really enjoyed Finn's character in TFA, you would be disappointed because you wanted to see where that character arc went, and then it didn't go anywhere.

The same can be said about the OT characters. If you don't know anything about Luke Skywalker and only know what you're told in the new movies, having him try to kill Kylo Ren can work, but for a lot of people who loved the OT and Luke as a character, it didn't feel earned. It's not that you can't have a character who was once good turn bad, but the last time we saw him he had unambiguously chosen the light, so to have the next time we see him be as this hermit who did something like that feels unearned. It can feel like the writers are saying that they know where they want Luke to end up, but they didn't feel like doing the legwork to get him there, so they just told the audience that it happened off screen. Generally, as a writer, if you want a character to change in a big way as a person, you need to establish how they got that way, and the audience needs to see it, or they're not going to be satisfied with the arc. For example, if you were to make an TV show where you have a character that goes from wanting to be a kind leader and to stop oppression and violence, and have her murder thousands of innocent people later on, you would need to establish over the course of a few seasons what specific events led her to be capable of that, and you would need to see her becoming more and more unhinged so that when she burns down a city full of Innocents unprompted, it feels earned because the audience has seen how she got there. If you just have her change on a dime and become genocidal without doing the work of making the audience understand how she got there, people are going to be upset.

Rise of Skywalker is a whole different thing. I could spend several hours explaining all the technical writing problems in the Rise of Skywalker, and how they failed once again to continue the themes and character arcs of the prior movies, and how poorly written the finale is, but the main point is, they failed to create satisfying payoffs to the existing story threads, and it's honestly one of the biggest writing trainwrecks I've ever seen.

The only things that make the new trilogy as a whole really worth watching, are the beautiful visuals, and the terrific acting. Adam Driver, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac all do a great job with what they're given, as do most of the supporting cast, but from a writing and narrative standpoint, it's abundantly clear that they didn't have a plan for how the story was going to go, and they basically just let each director and writing team do whatever they wanted without the input of the previous filmmakers, and when you're trying to make three movies that are meant to be connected as a trilogy, you need to at the very least have an outline for where you want the story to go at the beginning, or the story's going to be a mess, and that's what happened."
therewasanattempt,fq69ulv,t3_gf91k7,1589127399.0,"Also, if you've ever been to an American emergency room for something that isn't potentially fatal, you'll know that they don't exactly see you right away. I had a few broken bones a few years ago and it took 3-4 hours to be brought back, then another 2-3 hours before I could get an X-Ray, then they finally gave me the results back a few hours later, and then I waited another hour or two to get a cast and be allowed to leave. 

Beyond that though, can you imagine your best argument for not having universal healthcare being that if everybody gets healthcare it's too busy? You have to be pretty blind to fight to make sure not too many people can get life saving surgery without going bankrupt so you don't have to wait an extra couple hours in the ER for something non-fatal."
breakingbad,fq68o1n,t1_fq62tqa,1589126722.0,"It's because compared to the new trilogy it at least had consistent themes, a generally logical plot that makes sense from start to finish, and it was clearly thought out in advance, so it tells a cohesive story. That's where the bar is with Star Wars now.

Also, let's be honest, we all know that Revenge of the Sith was the only movie anybody actually wanted. Nobody really needed to see Anakin as a 10 year old, we wanted to see him turning into Darth Vader, and Revenge of the Sith, if you're willing to ignore a few awful lines, is not a horrible movie. It's not great, but it's like a C/C+ movie. Anakin's turn is kind of poorly paced, and Palpatine mowing down several jedi masters with ease was pretty silly, but Ewan McGregor and Ian McDiarmid were fantastic, the story was relatively well written in that it made sense and worked on a thematic level, and the last 30 minutes or so are mostly pretty good. Padmé's death wasn't great, and the ""no"" thing was obviously stupid, but Anakin and Obi-Wan's fight was really well done, Ewan McGregor nailed the emotional weight of leaving Anakin to die, and Yoda vs. Palpatine was at the least fun to watch. 

I'm not saying the prequels are good, but there are a few fun moments in each of them, and Revenge of the Sith in isolation from the first two is not terrible as a film. Even the first two though, like I said, have a handful of redeemable moments. Duel of the Fates is amazing, Qui-Gon's death was pretty well done, the speeder chase at the beginning of Attack of the Clones is pretty good, and the last 30-45 minutes of that movie, with the giant fight in the pit and the whole duel against Count Dooku are fun to watch."

AmItheAsshole,fpxr5re,t1_fpw1gzs,1588987904.0,"Yeah, I'm terrified of spiders, and pretty much all bugs, but I'm only concerned with leaving the room when it's something that can fly, because it could move while you're gone and you wouldn't know where it is until you got back, but spiders don't generally move that fast so if I were in that situation I'd probably just keep a healthy distance and keep my eye on them while I wait for him. It's scary but it's not going to kill me. Alternatively, because spiders don't move that much for the most part, she could have just gone and hid in the bedroom.

Honestly though, as scared as I am of bugs, if I'm home alone I find a way to take care of it. It usually consists of me stretching a shoebox or something as far away from my body towards it as possible and spending 15-20 minutes trying to inch it into the box without getting too close and also shaking like a leaf, but sometimes that's your best option. What would she have done if she was home alone? Can you imagine getting home, not seeing your girlfriend and having her call to tell you she moved in with her parents because she saw a spider? If she had the time and composure to pack some stuff up and walk past them to leave, she could have just as easily waited or figured out a solution. She's an adult. She can figure something out.

It really sounds like OP dodged a bullet. She clearly wasn't actually so scared of the spiders she decided fucking packing a bag and moving was the best option. My best guess is that she's one of those manipulative people who likes to overreact to small stuff like this, blame their partner, then demand that they come and beg for forgiveness or something ridiculous.

AmItheAsshole,fpwdyxu,t3_gfqvju,1588961769.0,"YTA. Think about it this way. In same sex platonic relationships, friends see each other totally naked all the time. If two women are friends or roommates, nobody bats an eye if they change in front of each other or whatever. I'm looking at this from the perspective of a queer woman. I've had totally platonic female friends change in front of me and vice versa, and nobody would ever consider that weird, because we're just friends. I am attracted to women, but nobody's going to call it weird for me to see my female friend naked in a platonic setting because we're both girls.

Why should that be different in this situation? You're telling me you've never seen your friends in their underwear or a bathrobe before? The only reason to see this as ""inappropriate"" is if you don't trust your boyfriend and think he's going to do something with her, and if you have that little trust in him, you probably shouldn't be together. 

If it wouldn't be weird for two female roommates to walk around in just panties and a t-shirt even though one or both of them is in a relationship, this shouldn't be weird either. The only reason some people see it as weird is because a lot of our society has this backwards idea that straight men can't just be friends with straight women, and there always has to be some sexual component where one is into the other, but that's totally ridiculous.

The main point is, this is only inappropriate if you think they have a sexual or romantic relationship, and if you think that's the case, you probably shouldn't be with him. It's very clear that this is not the main issue here. I don't know whether you're overly insecure or you just don't trust him, but either way, she is not the problem, and it's super uncool to text her separately to complain."
AmItheAsshole,fpwcoh4,t1_fpv9ey7,1588961122.0,"OP says that they have a brother/sister type relationship, so they're obviously really close. It's not like they're just roommates. If my brother wears his boxers around the house I'm not going to care about it and I wouldn't expect my girlfriend to care about it either. It's all about trust. If she had a problem with this, she should have mentioned it when she first saw it. If she was uncomfortable with it, that's something you bring up right away, not something you wait almost a year to mention. I can imagine that OP's boyfriend is probably really surprised because this has been the situation for almost a year and she hadn't really issued a concern with it until now. That's a really weird situation to put him in.

On top of that, the thing that tells me without a doubt that this is about OP's insecurity and not any sort of actual problem, is the bathrobe thing. She's upset that she wears a bathroom around her own home? Seriously? If that's enough to make OP jealous, there's a deeper problem here. If you don't trust your boyfriend enough to have somebody he sees as his sister wear a bathrobe in front of him in their home, she isn't the problem.

I think the perfect way to look at this is to alter the situation a bit. If the roommate was a guy and he walked around the apartment in his boxers, would that still be inappropriate? Or is it because she's a woman and OP is sexualizing a non-sexual situation because of her own insecurity. Look at this from her boyfriend's perspective. He's never once thought about this as a sexual situation, and up until now he's been under the impression that his girlfriend didn't either. Of course he's not going to immediately agree with her because she didn't make it known that she had a problem with it.

I would be willing to say no assholes if she's just gone to her boyfriend, expressed her discomfort, and asked him to sit down and explain why she was uncomfortable so they could talk it out like adults. At that point, nobody has done anything wrong. From the boyfriend's perspective and the roommate's perspective they're practically siblings and they've just been living their lives. If neither of them knew OP had a problem with it, they can't be the assholes. If they had a disagreement over it and talked it out there wouldn't be any assholes. The only really asshole thing going on here is OP overstepping and texting the roommate separately. Other than that, nobody has done anything that would make them remotely the asshole."

Unless you have a counter, that being another candidate with a better chance than Biden against Trump, you're just being a contrarian, which is even less useful. If you're going to complain that one solution doesn't work but you also don't have a better solution, there's no reason to complain about it, because a solution is better than no solution. Make a point or don't, I don't care, but if you don't have a thought as to who might have been better than Biden to beat Trump, you're just trolling.

(Also, it's worth mentioning that this is even more of a straw man than your last response. Address the whole point or don't bother responding.)"
PoliticalMemes,fpt2bhd,t1_fpt1e74,1588883635.0,"Damn, that's impressive. Two blatant logical fallacies in about three sentences. First one, you can't heavily imply something and then pretend it was never said. You're saying that Biden being nominated hands the election to Trump. The alternative would be Bernie being nominated. If you weren't trying to make the point that Bernie could beat Trump and Biden can't, what exactly are you getting at? That's a childish argument, stop using it. Second one, assuming that a personal belief of yours is ""obvious"" and therefore you don't have to explain it or justify it because you're right and everybody else is wrong, so they should just believe you without any convincing or they're wrong and stupid. Biden is leading by a wide margin in the polls, and don't pull that ""sO wAs hiLlArY"" argument because it's another logical fallacy and is just deflecting from the actual point. There's no reason based on any sort of evidence besides ""because I feel like it's true"" that Bernie would have a better chance against Trump than Biden. Biden is polling better in the key states that Hillary lost than Bernie was, and he was and still is polling better in all of the major swing states. If you don't have any evidence outside of anecdotal evidence and logical fallacies to back up your claim, don't make your claim as a statement of fact. This is high school shit.

Edit: just noticed a third logical fallacy. Strawman argument. You addressed the primary voting bit not the fact that Biden is polling better against Trump in those states than Biden. You can't pick out a piece of an argument and pretend it's the whole argument. You just chose the part that was easier to argue against and pretended the more solid point was never made."
PoliticalMemes,fpt0nfp,t1_fpt02xz,1588882820.0,"Yes, because as we all know, the guy who receives less votes and polls at lower numbers has a better chance of winning against Trump?"
PoliticalMemes,fpsra3c,t1_fpsnx1f,1588878273.0,"It's nobody's ""fault"" because nothing wrong happened. Bernie might have mobilized maybe 5% more of the youth vote than would normally vote, but Biden is much more likely to mobilize moderate voters and those who were on the fence, and there's a lot more votes to be won in that category, especially in swing states. That's why Biden is polling better than Bernie in practically every major swing state. There are a lot of older and more moderate Democrats who likely wouldn't have voted for Bernie because they see him as a radical. Whether that's fair or not, it's the image he created for himself, and that image just isn't helpful for winning in US elections. Bernie lost because he's less electable in 2020 America than Biden. This election is going to be about states that are on the fence, and Biden has a much better chance at winning those states than Bernie did. Hell, just look at Texas. Some polls are now showing Biden tied or leading in Texas over Trump. It's because Bernie's persona only appealed to the people that already agreed with him. His campaign strategy didn't do anything to help him win over voters that were on the fence it just alienated people, which is why he wasn't polling as successfully in these swing states. When it comes down to it, the 2020 election is going to come down to swing states, like most elections do, and Biden does really well in swing states, to the point that he's close to turning Texas into a swing state. I don't think Texas is going to vote blue this year, although it is trending that way, but the fact that Texas is going to be a competitive state in 2020 shows exactly how much better Biden is in swing states.

Bernie's big problem is that he took the most radical stance of any candidate, and then isolated those who didn't agree, so he got the people, mainly young people, who agree with him, but anybody who wasn't 100% on board the Bernie train was never going to switch to his side because his tactics isolated them. Biden did the opposite. Biden is best known for getting people behind him that might not have been at the start, and that's why he won. I actually agree generally with Bernie's vision for the country, and I think a candidate with Bernie's platform will do really well in 15-20 years, but Biden played smart and Bernie didn't, and that's why Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee. It's not the DNC's fault, and it's not the electorate's fault. The only person to blame for Bernie's loss is Bernie, and maybe a little bit his followers, because they certainly didn't help his image. You can't dispute the fact that Biden is doing better in swing states, because it's not my opinion, it's just the way it is. Bernie's own party turned against him because he didn't run a campaign that stood a chance in a general election. His campaign was built on big and impractical ideas and polarization. Those aren't winning campaign strategies in any political arena. 

To clarify, I'm not saying his ideas are impractical logistically, I'm saying they're impractical in the US right now. Bernie says he wants universal healthcare and free college and a lot of people lose their minds because it's a good idea. The problem is, most people saw that as good as the ideas might be, they're not going to happen, because America isn't ready for them. Most people saw that he can say he wants universal healthcare all he wants, but whatever universal healthcare bill gets written up isn't going to get through the Senate. Bernie also created a persona of a revolutionary who would refuse to compromise, which caused a bigger problem. His base loved it, but what everybody else saw was a guy with ideas that were going to get shot down, and who would refuse to compromise. That's why the voters decided they would rather have Biden. Whether it's true or not, Bernie created the image that he was an all or nothing kind of guy, so most voters looked at their options and saw one guy with realistic ideas that would be improvements over what we have now, and another guy who would go all or nothing on ideas that wouldn't work, and we'd end up with nothing instead of all. You don't have to like it, but that's the truth of why Biden won. Democrats decided they preferred something to nothing. If Bernie had created a different image for himself, made himself seem like a more reliable option, and tried to campaign in a way that made people want to join him instead of isolating the majority of the electorate, he might be running against Donald Trump, but he didn't, so he's not, and that's on him."

As much as it would be a nice thing to do in their eyes to help another child by adopting them, they as the adults should be taking note of how they're affecting their child that they have now. It sounds kind of cold to say, but the fact is, as of this moment, they have two children they're responsible for. Those two children need to be a priority. If adding a third into the mix is going to hurt the others in a serious way, you and your brother have to be their priority. Not because you're their bio kids, but because you're their kids, and Jess is not yet.

Unfortunately, I grew up with parents like this who got tunnel vision and didn't see my brother and I as people with real needs and feelings, so they discarded what we thought in favor of what they wanted and it was frequently not good for us. I absolutely urge you to push the issue and try your best to make it clear to them that you're a nearly adult person with very real thoughts and feelings, and that adopting another child is going to hurt you. Honestly, realistically speaking, if they're set on adopting or fostering children, the best thing to do would probably be to wait until you and your brother are out of the house. At that point they'll be in their mid 50s and they can make decisions about what to do in the household without it negatively affecting anybody. It makes a lot of sense to do that, and it really works out best for everybody. My childhood best friend was in that exact situation. His parents had bio kids, then when they were in their 20s and all moved out, they adopted my friend and his little sister. If they really want to adopt kids or foster kids, they'll absolutely still be young enough to do it at that point, especially if they're trying to adopt older kids. I don't know if they've considered this possibility but honestly it seems like a great way to avoid hurting you and your brother and also to allow them to do what they wanted to do, just a little later than they were expecting."
PoliticalMemes,fps7h5o,t3_gf09hn,1588868753.0,"Lmao, this is one of the most absurd political takes out there. Biden is polling higher than Bernie. More people voted for him than Bernie. I don't see how you can argue that more people would show up to vote for Bernie than Biden when the voters literally had that chance and they voted for Biden. He's also doing a lot better in swing states, and in demographic groups that actually vote. Bernie's big claim is that young people like him, but young people still didn't come out to vote for him, because it doesn't matter who the candidate is, you're not going to get a high percentage of young people to vote. Bernie not getting a huge boost from youth voters in the primary is clear evidence of that fact. Biden does better in the groups that actually vote. People 40 or older. He also polls a lot better with most other demographic groups aside from young people. Bernie's only advantage was that he polled much better than Biden in the least important demographic. The only reason it looks like ""everybody wanted Bernie"" to all these people on the internet is because the internet is dominated by people 25 and under. Most people on apps like Twitter and Reddit are younger, so of course you're going to see a lot of people on the internet saying they wanted Bernie. It doesn't matter. The people who turn out to vote in the primaries are the same people who consistently turn out to vote in the general election, and those people overwhelmingly picked Biden. It wasn't even particularly close. Stop blaming everybody else for the fact that your candidate didn't gather as many voters as the other guy. Bernie losing in the primary is on Bernie. I like the guy, but he lost, by a wide margin, and even if he had continued campaigning, he was only projected to beat Biden in a handful more states. Get out of your little bubble for a minute and look at the world outside of your echochamber for a minute. The voters decided they would rather have Joe Biden. The polls show that Joe Biden has a better chance to beat Donald Trump. The polls show that Joe Biden is more likely to bring in people in the middle, who would have either voted for Trump or stayed home if it was Bernie. These aren't my opinions, they're facts. You can't pretend they don't exist because they contradict your worldview."

MadeMeSmile,fpoxw3x,t1_fpo8c0n,1588792546.0,"There's a great excerpt from Sarah McBride's (transgender activist) book, when she was trying to get a bill passed to put in place protections in Delaware for trans people to use their preferred restrooms, where she detailed this back and forth with a Republican representative where he kept asking her ""where in this bill does it prevent sexual assault in bathrooms?"" and she told him like 10 times that it doesn't, because sexual assault is already illegal, and it isn't necessary to include in a bill laws that already exist. It would be like putting a mention in the bill that murder is still illegal. He never understood what she was trying to say. The bill did pass though.

Long story short, trans people have been using their preferred restrooms for years and there's never been a problem of trans people committing sexual assault in restrooms, it's just another transparent attempt at using nonexistent issues to justify bigotry, and whenever you hear congressmen talk about how ""if these bills were around when I was in high school I would have pretended to be trans so I could molest women in locker rooms"" just stop for a minute and think about the fact that he just admitted that creepy people like that are the ones who are actually looking for ways to sexually assault women, not trans people.

AmItheAsshole,fpovbeb,t3_geiw7s,1588791276.0,"NTA. Your wife is refusing to have a conversation with you. Not to be overly dramatic, but the majority of the time, this kind of refusal to communicate is what kills otherwise healthy marriages. The best way to have a long and happy life with your spouse is to talk openly with each other. You're coming to her with something that's bothering you, and by refusing to listen to you, she's telling you that she doesn't care about your feelings, and that because she doesn't see it as an issue, it isn't an issue. If that kind of selfishness and poor communication becomes a habit in other aspects of your life outside of this individual issue, you have a serious problem.

Rule number one when trying to openly communicate with your spouse is that you can't ignore the other person's concerns. It doesn't matter if their concerns seem stupid or insignificant to you, all that matters is that they're telling you something that's bothering them, and you can't tell them that they're wrong for being bothered. If she can't talk to you and rationally explain why her needs are more important than your needs, she doesn't get to just overrule you and make your own house feel like it's her house.

I think you need to make it clear that if she's not willing to have an open and honest conversation with you and decide together what to do, you're not going to put up with that. It's incredibly manipulative to unilaterally make decisions for the family and then refuse to recognize how the other person feels on those decisions, and she needs to realize how fucked up it is to do that."
AmItheAsshole,fpl2wrf,t1_fpjs9x2,1588705417.0,"Emphasis on that last point. This situation aside, if you took him this time, B and GF would take that to mean that it's okay for them to show up at your house whenever with their kid and you'll just take him. You weren't part of their decision to have a kid, so naturally, you have no responsibility to take care of him. It's a nice thing to do to babysit from time to time with notice and if it doesn't interfere with your life, but you have no obligation to them. They chose to have a baby, not you, so if they can't handle raising a baby without manipulating their loved ones into getting their way, that's on them. I hate the notion that if you don't have kids you somehow ""owe"" something to people who do, as if everybody has a natural obligation to raise a child whether they want to or not, so if you don't have one you have to help. That's not how it works. If you're okay with the responsibility of having a kid, you can have a kid, but people who don't want to have kids chose that for a reason, and it's not so they can watch other people's kids."

honesttransgender,fpgz8ok,t3_gdcjbd,1588612158.0,"I prefer transgender, mainly because a lot of people mix up gender and sexuality, and using the term transsexual tends to feed into that, because it's phrased like it's a sexuality (homosexual, bisexual, transsexual,) so I think it's just easier to avoid the term transsexual because generally if somebody isn't really plugged in to the trans community they'll assume you're referring to a sexual orientation because that's what it sounds like. Transsexual to me is just one of those words that's poorly made. Like I look at it and wonder if whoever came up with it was trying to confuse people, because the actual word itself conveys something entirely different from what it's trying to say. I feel like if I say I'm trans or transgender people generally get what I'm saying, but if I say I'm transsexual I have to explain that my sexuality has nothing to do with the fact that I'm trans.

Beyond that, the actual meaning of transsexual also makes me a bit uncomfortable, for a few reasons. Mainly, people seem to use it to distinguish a trans person who has medically transitioned or at least plans to, vs one who hasn't, and that distinction feels kind of unnecessarily exclusionary. Most people I've seen complaining about the word transgender say they use transsexual because they don't want to get grouped in with ""those kinds of people"" referring to those who haven't medically transitioned, and that just feels like the entire word exists to say that trans people who have medically transitioned are better than those who hasn't, which is like a really weird flex. Sometimes people will say that it's to separate themselves from the crazy side of the trans community with the neopronouns and 176 genders and everything, which in theory I suppose makes sense, but still, that's implying that people who haven't medically transitioned or maybe don't plan to are inherently part of that crazy group, and which just feels unfair, because it's not true and once again, assumes that anybody who doesn't medically transition is ""lesser than.""

The other issue for me that's somewhat related is that, in general, I think we can all agree that while labels can be helpful, at a certain point when labels get too specific. The point of labels is to simplify interactions, so labels like gay or straight or trans can be helpful, but all the weird genders people come up with to say stuff like ""I'm 72% female, 28%.male aren't, because they're complicating rather than simplifying, and exist to get across information that nobody really needs to know and that isn't really relevant. I think the transsexual label falls into that latter category. All it really does is distinguish that you plan to medically transition, but is that really necessary information for anybody but yourself? We can all generally agree that it's not cool for people to ask questions about your body or what surgeries you have or haven't had unless you're really close to them, because that's information that doesn't matter to anybody but you, your doctor, and a few people in your immediate circle. Transsexual to me just feels like another label that complicates the discussion for no real reason, just like neopronouns do. At it's core, it's a label that exists solely to get across information that nobody needs to know. It doesn't simplify anything, and it doesn't make anything clear. The only thing it does is make sure you're not being grouped in with a group of people you see as ""less than"" and honestly, even if you don't feel that way, I can absolutely see how it would make them feel that way. At best it's kind of like ""hey, I know we're totally equal and everything, I definitely don't think I'm better than you, but it's very important to me that nobody thinks I'm like you."" It's kind of like in the gay community when people use the term ""gold star gay"" or ""gold star lesbian"" as a subtle little way to say that they're above the other people in their community because they haven't had sex with the opposite gender. It doesn't really help anybody, nobody needs the information it's providing, and it mostly just serves as a subtle jab at people it doesn't apply to."
honesttransgender,fpf73aw,t1_fpf4s4j,1588563369.0,"That's not really how things work. First off, your example seems confused. If somebody identifies as male but has the brain of a female and wants to be seen as a female? That doesn't make sense.

Beyond that though, I appreciate the concept of somebody discovering their own gender identity, but we can't pretend facts that we don't like don't count as facts because we don't like them. If I were a Christian, and I were to say that all of the studies and facts of evolution are wrong because they disagree with my existing beliefs with no other reasoning, I would be wrong. 

We talk about gender identity as if gender is some foreign concept like a soul that just is and has no earthly meaning like a soul, but I assure you that's the case with very little in this world. Before we knew all these facts we've learned about gender in the past decade or so, most people believed that gender and sex were the same thing. Since then, we've found information that proves otherwise, so naturally we as a society should change out views and accept the fact that gender and sex aren't the same thing. In turn, we've also learned that the abstract concept that is ""gender"" isn't so abstract after all, and we've learned where and why gender is the way it is, which is a big discovery. With that in mind, we now all have a choice. We can choose to accept the facts and adjust accordingly, or we can plug our ears and pretend that because the facts contradict something we believe, they don't matter. When people realized smoking was bad for your lungs, a lot of people chose to ignore that new discovery, and unsurprisingly, those people kept smoking and ultimately died a lot younger than they otherwise would have.

I understand that it's hard to abandon something you very strongly believed to be true, but if there's irrefutable evidence proving it wrong, it's just illogical to pretend that the evidence doesn't exist. The same concept applies to the people protesting stay at home orders because they think the coronavirus is a hoax. We all see them as pretty foolish, and that's because they're willfully ignoring things that are objectively true. The fact of the matter in this case is that I'm not making the distinction between the neurological definition of gender and gender identity because there isn't one. We now know for a fact what gender is and how it works, and what it is, is a neurological phenomenon. What I've explained in my other comments is what gender is. To ignore that for the sake of your own personal beliefs is just ignorant. If I were to claim I have lung cancer, then I go to a hospital and they tell me that I don't have lung cancer, I say to myself, ""okay, I guess I don't have lung cancer."" I don't say ""but I have the symptoms of lung cancer, and I made the conclusion that I had it, so I do have it,"" because we have a way of knowing there things beyond our own personal feelings.

The problem is, when you're talking about somebody's internal sense of identity, humans are very complicated. We have a lot of different thought processes and ideas, so it's easy for us to make mistakes. It's easy to confuse any number of things as evidence of genderfluidity. I know one person who thought she was genderfluid because she liked to dress feminine some days and masculine other days, and she acted traditionally feminine in some ways an traditionally masculine in other ways. A few years later, she realized that she wasn't really genderfluid, she just liked to experiment with different forms of gender expression. That's the kind of thing I'm talking about. Our personal internal sense of identity can be wrong, and it often is wrong. That's why in most places, you go see a doctor before you transition medically, to make sure you aren't making a mistake and taking things that aren't actually dysphoria and interpreting them as such.

As tempting as it is to cling onto things like this, if we have empirical evidence that shows us one thing and continue to believe the opposite, that's a serious problem, and that's the case in this situation. We have empirical evidence that genderfluidity is not possible. To ignore that makes us no better than the people who claim in spite of evidence that vaccines cause autism, or that climate change is a hoax, or that the coronavirus doesn't exist."
honesttransgender,fpf15dd,t1_fpeywi8,1588559385.0,"If in theory there were a way to test with 100% accuracy then probably not, but the thing is, we don't know the extent of *exactly* what a male brain or a female brain looks like. We know the general shape and structure and some other things, but there's also some discrepancy in that. For instance, obviously, not all brains look the same regardless of gender, and a 100% male or female brain would imply that the brain received exclusively one hormone, which isn't realistic. Like sexuality, it's unlikely that anybody has would would be considered a 100% female brain or vice versa. We know that the vast majority of people in this case have brains that are generally consistent with their birth sex, and we can use all that data about brain structure to figure out what an average male or female brain looks like. The studies that have been done are essentially just taking an MRI of the brain or a trans identifying person, and comparing it to that of a cis person of the same gender and opposite gender, (i.e. comparing a trans male to an average cis male and cis female) and concluding that generally, the trans brains so to speak were more consistent with that of the person's gender than their biological sex. 

Also like sexuality, there's naturally some degree of interpretation to be had. For example, if I were to ask you what the ratio is that makes somebody bisexual vs being gay or straight, you wouldn't have an answer, and most people wouldn't, because there is no hard and fast rule. If a female would describe her attraction as 20:80 in favor of guys, it's really up to her whether she wants to identify as straight or bisexual. If it's 1:99, it's a little more clear cut, but obviously, there's some degree of uncertainty when you're talking about labels for a certain ratio. The same can be applied to gender. There isn't a real way right now to look at a brain and determine what ""percentage"" male or female it is, but generally speaking, if somebody who is assigned female at birth has a brain that is 20% consistent with a male brain, and 80% consistent with a female brain, is that person a cis female or non-binary? I don't know, because there is no answer. It's generally up to that person to decide for themselves. If it's 1% male and 99% female, the answer is much more clear, and unlike sexuality, for about 99% of the population, it is in that range where it's pretty clear which gender a brain is structured as.

So it depends what this ""test"" entails. Right now, I would say no, I wouldn't be able to look at an MRI and decide whether a person is necessarily trans or not, because we also don't know if there are more signs we're missing. For every 10 things we know about the brain there are 20 we don't know, so that's a very real possibility. The only reason genderfluidity would be considered a virtual impossibility is that no matter what indicators we may not know, we know that gender occurs in the brain, and that the brain doesn't change like that. Like everything in science, you can never say with 100% certainty that something's impossible, even simple things, but unless the entirety of everything we know about gender and brain structure and brain chemistry is completely wrong, there's no basis for genderfluidity to exist. It happens frequently in science that things once believed to be facts end up being incorrect, but generally not on this scale. If genderfluidity does exist, quite literally nothing about neurology and biology would ever be the same again, because that would mean practically everything we've learned about the brain for thousands of years was wrong.

However, if you're referring to some theoretical future where we can look at a brain with close to 100% certainty and pin down exactly what percentage male or female that brain is, then sure. If that existed and it showed that somebody assigned female at birth was 99:1 or 98:2 female over male, I would feel comfortable saying that that individual is not trans. The same applies to almost anything. If you could look into somebody's brain and say with nearly 100% certainty whether or not any number of things about them is true, I would absolutely use that. For instance, if somebody thinks they have depression, and we could look into their brain with nearly 100% certainty and determine that the person does not have depression, I would feel totally fine saying that they don't have depression. I don't see any good reason why you would ignore something if it can give you a truly conclusive answer to your question. We have that level of certainty with other things, and we listen to those things. For instance, we have that level of certainty that vaccines don't cause autism, so if somebody were to come to me and tell me that their child developed autism because of a vaccine, I would feel comfortable telling that person that they're wrong, because that's what you do when you have that degree of certainty in anything like this."

honesttransgender,fpdqx1g,t1_fpdo71g,1588532427.0,"Short answer: we have a better understanding of how dysphoria works and what makes somebody trans neurologically, and the information we have disproves the idea that gender itself can fluctuate.

Long answer: what studies of trans people's brains structure have shown us is that gender exists in the brain, and is not the same as sex. Generally speaking, most people born as part of the female sex have different brain structures than those born with the male sex. These differences in the brain are what cause some of the biological differences in men and women not related to societal influence. The sex and gender are usually the same in most people because the brain develops based on the sex as a male or female brain. In some situations, the brain is exposed to the incorrect balance of hormones when it's developing in the womb, causing it to develop as the opposite of the sex. This creates the condition known as gender dysphoria, and is what causes people to be trans. Because the brain is that of a female and the body is that of a male, there's an incongruence that causes varying degrees of discomfort and distress, so to alleviate that discomfort, the person will change their gender identity to match that of their brain, and take whatever steps they feel are appropriate to enforce that physically, ranging from smaller cosmetic things like changing their hair and dressing differently, to more serious things like hormones and surgeries. That is the explanation behind binary trans people, who make up the majority of the trans population.

As of now, there have not been any significant studies on the brains of non-binary identifying people, but it is believed by many neurologists and experts in this field that based on the above process, it is a realistic possibility that an even smaller percentage of people could be born with brains that aren't unambiguously male or unambiguously female, and for those people it would make sense that identifying as either a male or a female would cause discomfort, because their brain doesn't fit either of those descriptions. This would essentially mean that non-binary is to gender what intersex is to sex.

Continuing to look at theories around gender, if you look at genderfluidity under this same lens, it becomes clear that it is impossible, because the process that causes an individual to have a gender that is different from their birth sex happens before birth, and it is impossible for the structure of the brain to change in an adult human in a way that would alter their gender after their brain is developed. The general consensus on why some people may have considered themselves genderfluid now that we know it isn't a possibility, is that they likely either have a non-binary gender or their gender doesn't correlate with their sex, and they just were incorrect about what was actually happening, and/or, they were confusing gender with gender roles. It's a common mistake to make, but essentially, gender roles are created almost entirely by the cultures we live in, and have very little to do with biology or brain chemistry. For example, there is nothing about a man or a woman that would inherently make one more inclined to wear dresses and makeup, or to favor different activites. These concepts are enforced from a young age so most people go along with them, but there's nothing scientific about them, so if somebody's gender expression changes, as in sometimes they want to wear a dress and makeup and sometimes they want to wear a suit and pants, that doesn't mean that their gender is changing, because gender and gender expression are not correlated.

I'm not trying to bash on people who identified themselves as genderfluid at one point or another, because figuring out your gender identity and trying to figure out whether you just don't fit into your traditional gender role or you're actually trans is really fucking hard, and I do feel bad for anybody who thought they had figured it out but are now learning that they didn't, but the fact of the matter is, based on what we know now about how gender works, it is a virtual impossibility that a person's gender could be fluid like that."

PoliticalMemes,fpdhoeq,t1_fpdh6f5,1588527186.0,"So you're telling me that Donald Trump is better or the same for struggling people than Joe Biden? I honestly refuse to believe that anybody is that dense. Let's say under Biden absolutely nothing changes, and we basically go back to where we were in 2016 when Trump got elected, and then for four years absolutely no new progress gets made. That's obviously absurdly stupid, but let's pretend that was actually the case. That would still be much better for struggling people than a Trump presidency. You can convince yourself that you're trying to ""take a stand"" but the question is, against who or what? Thousands of people don't vote every year. The government doesn't see somebody staying home out of ""protest"" as any different from staying home out of apathy, so if you want to tell me that Donald Trump is better for struggling Americans than Joe Biden, go ahead, but you'd almost have to be trying to sound as ignorant as possible to actually believe that."

nflmemes,fpdebif,t3_gcrxmf,1588525310.0,"Do the Packers really need weapons that badly? Ik this is going to get downvoted but the lack of weapons isn't the reason they lost in the NFC championship game. There are a lot of teams with a lot less weapons that nobody talks about needing weapons. How many quarterbacks have somebody as good or better than DeVante Adams? Maybe 8? Adams is a top 10 receiver in the league, then he had Devin Funchess, who is a respectable 2nd or 3rd option, and Marquez Valdes-Scantling, who's pretty good, and young so is still improving. Allen Lazard is also pretty good and young, and then Aaron Jones is one of the better runningbacks who can also be used as a passing target. I'm just saying, Russell Wilson's top targets last year were Tyler Lockett, a rookie, and a couple tight ends nobody had heard of until this season, including Will Dissly who was basically a pure blocking tight end until last year but was a top target until he got hurt, and Russell Wilson was a borderline MVP candidate. I haven't heard anybody complaining about Russell Wilson's lack of weapons and he has worse weapons, he just does more with them."
PoliticalMemes,fpdcqgx,t1_fpcp066,1588524416.0,"Here's the thing. The president doesn't decide these things on their own. I honestly don't care if a candidate says he wants Medicare for all because it'll never get past the Senate either way. I'm more concerned about who can actually get things done. If the option is to have a Medicare for all bill get stuck in political gridlock for two years only for a less progressive bill to come through and get passed in it's place, or just starting with that compromise bill and getting that passed, I'm taking the latter. Big picture ideas are great but I'm more interested in who seems capable of compromising so that they can get some of what they want instead of none of it. The same thing applies to free college or cancelling student loans. It would be a good thing but anybody expecting it to happen in the next 4 years is dreaming. Maybe 20 years down the road when the US as a whole is much more progressive it'll have a chance, but right now it just doesn't. In the meantime, there are very real issues that are going to be decided in the next 4 years that are going to affect myself and millions of other Americans. Right now, of the two major candidates with a real chance at winning, one supports more progressive healthcare than the other. One supports more assistance for the lower and middle class than the other. One believes in climate change and wants to stop it, the other does not. One wants to support the LGBT community, one wants to pass actively discriminatory policies against the LGBT community, and is actively trying to rollback protections that allow trans people to be treated for anything in the middle of a global pandemic. One supports a reformed immigration system, one puts children in cages where dozens of them get lost and die. One supports gun control, the other doesn't. One hasn't committed treason, the other likely has. That's not even getting into telling people to inject Lysol to prevent the coronavirus, discriminating against black renters, mocking a disabled reporter, labeling every news network that says anything remotely negative about him as lying, spreading statistics from biased polls he himself runs, and dozens of other things that five years ago would have been disqualifying for a presidential candidate. 

I don't care if you like it or not, one of these two is going to be president for the next four years, is going to be the difference between life and death for millions of Americans, is going to replace RBG, and is going to define a crucial turning point in our country. To be honest, I couldn't care less that people are sad that their candidate lost. He lost. More democrats thought the other guy was better for 2020 America. The fact of the matter is, a lot of people are threatening to boycott the election because they're dumb enough to think that makes a difference. The republican party had made a political strategy out of stopping people from voting. Nothing about the system at large is going to change because you didn't vote. A lot of people are threatening not to vote because they feel comfortable saying that if Trump is president for 4 more years, they will survive. A lot of us can't say that. For Muslims, Mexicans, African-Americans, people living in poverty, the LGBT community, and many other affected groups, 4 years of Trump is going to mean a death sentence for a lot of us. My best friend became homeless at 16 and almost died as a result of Trump's policies and hatred, so I'm not going to stand for people making a ""protest"" and letting this go on out of spite. The only person being helped by the infighting and arrogance on the left right now is Donald Trump. It's not helping Bernie Sanders. It sure as hell isn't helping the disenfranchised. The only things benefitting are Trump, and the egos of a bunch of straight white kids who have the money and the privilege to pretend to care about the people who are struggling only to turn their backs when it's time to actual do something about it."
oldfreefolk,fpayebj,t1_fpavsvz,1588458298.0,"That would be a great scene, I'm just trying to wrap my head around whether or not that's an earned resolution to his arc. I feel like it would be controversial, because you could argue that it would end his arc or wouldn't depending on what you see his arc as. If that were the ending, I agree that you would definitely have to break him down a lot more. Arya would probably have to die, Bran could maybe live but I suppose he's not really himself anymore, Sam would have to die, and Ghost would also probably have to die. It could definitely work as a bittersweet ending. Yes, there's finally a good man in charge but the person we loved so much is broken and hopeless. 

Personally, and I know this would also be controversial, I don't think Jon would live to the end if I were to rewrite the show, for a couple reasons. First off, if Jon is alive, it inherently complicates things. They didn't address it but having Jon alive while somebody else claims the throne is a big problem, because he's the rightful heir by blood. The only way somebody can take the throne and hold on to that power without major problems is if everybody else with a claim, so all the Baratheon's and Targaryen's would have to be dead, and that includes Jon. The second reason is that I think it would be a perfect example of setting up a fantasy ending where the hero wins the day and putting a twist on it. Having him be King but be miserable also does that in a sort of roundabout way, but I think it would be really interesting to have the guy who's been set up as some sort of mystical prophet who's meant to come save the day, end up dying. It also allows for the continuation of the theme of what happened to Robb and Ned. Sansa points it out to Jon that Robb and Ned were good men who tried to do the noble thing and that's what got them killed. If you want to live in Westeros you have to find a balance between being noble and being smart. As much as I love Jon, I don't know that he's any less noble to a fault than Ned was. 

The way I would see it going down is probably, off the top of my head, after he kills Dany, Grey Worm enters the throne room with some of the unsullied, and instead of holding him prisoner, he goes into a rage seeing Dany dead and kills him. It feels a little off, but I can't think of anybody better than Grey Worm to do it. Maybe if Jorah were still alive he would be better suited, I'm not totally sure. 

There's a rule that comedy comes in threes, meaning you can't really repeat a joke or joke format more than three times without it starting to feel tired, and I think the same applies to plot twists. Ned died because he was a good man, but not able to navigate politics and be smart about it. Robb died because he was a good man and tried to do the noble thing instead of the smart thing. In this situation, Jon would die because even though he's doing the right thing, he didn't go about it in a smart way, and he didn't think through the consequences of his actions, just like Robb failed to when he broke his promise to Walder Frey. The smart thing to do would have been to work out a plan with Tyrion and Sansa to kill her, but he acted on his gut feeling of having to do the right thing without thinking through the consequences. 

I think this also works into the ending in which Sansa ends up the queen, because the difference between her and Jon, as established in season 6, is that he's a good and noble person, but she is those things is well, while also having an understanding of how the ""game of thrones"" is played. She's noble *and* smart, which sets her apart from Ned, Robb, and Jon. It could work with the other ending, because it would still be interesting to show Jon dying because of his lack of foresight, then cutting to the people who are living, like Tyrion and Sansa, doing exactly what kept them alive this long, which is being smart and playing the long game. There might be a better way to go about it, I'm not entirely sure. I do really want to see that scene of Jon sitting defeated on the throne though, Kit Harrington would totally do amazing with a scene like that."
