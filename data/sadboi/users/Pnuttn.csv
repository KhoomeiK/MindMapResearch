Both are good phones :) I would definitely suggest getting the pixel but it really depends on what you need. Do you need iMessage? Do you need some iPhone apps that doesn't have an android version? And so on.

If your cable is too short then get a extension cable. They cost almost nothing. Or get some very cheap used speakers from a second hand shop or something. It's not worth to try to fix this problem when there is a very simple solution.
