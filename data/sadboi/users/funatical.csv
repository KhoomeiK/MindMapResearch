I did acid and mushrooms (and other hallucinogens) a lot when I was younger. Now that I am much older than my teens and early 20s I violently hallucinate and it is super intense. Was there a reaction from the drugs? It was a couple of weeks of sustaining off a revelation but ultimately a crash when brain chemistry returned.

Molly (if we are talking pure mdma) caused a massive issue as did the lesser ecstasy. Last time I did molly I was wrecked for a couple of months. Depression mainly. Ecstasy always left me chasing. I bought 50 tabs at one point before I quit. My x and I were snorting them. The depression that followed was incredibly intense and I ended up in a mental ward for a while.

The condition can be fatal and she knows that but she wasnt thinking. Things have been more or less cordial.

My oldest and I have a scary amount in common including what we collectively term ""the darkness"" which covers a ton of moods, thoughts, and behaviors. Its to early to tell if she will end up with it but she knows she has a solid base. I am the go to parent for most every issue. That usually means a phone call but I see them often and things come up. My favorite thus far being ""How do I talk to boys?"" which was awesome. When my x told me 3 weeks later that my daughter had a crush I had to pretend it was new information. For the record I didnt demonize men in any regard.
