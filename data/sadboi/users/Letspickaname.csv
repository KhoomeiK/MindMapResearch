I started at 110 pounds and lost ten pounds my first two or three months, I couldn’t eat, I couldn’t get out of bed. I just did the best I could and I’m not advising anyone do what I did, but she asked, HOW did we cope with quitting and I answered honestly. I know many moms with healthy canna babies and children."
MMJ,fqol0bw,t3_gk0nzp,1589517734.0,"I didn’t. I used weed every day of my last pregnancy. I was six/seven months pregnant when I renewed my card and I was in Oregon (8 years ago) and didn’t know how the doctor would respond so I just didn’t mention it. I show very late in my pregnancies and you couldn’t tell with my clothes on. During the exam he felt my belly and I’m sure he noticed a firm bulge on an otherwise skinny person, but he said nothing. I smoked every day, but if you don’t want to smoke I’d just use edibles. I use weed for many things but my qualifying condition is nausea (due to psych meds) and it went through the roof during my last pregnancy. Even with weed and dissolvable zofran I vomited almost every single day of my entire pregnancy. It was awful."
