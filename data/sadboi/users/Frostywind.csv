Just going to a place not knowing anybody, seems very daunting cause I think of all these scenarios that could happen.

The hardest part is just going in there and starting blind eye without knowing anyone."

narcissism,evlrnw8,t1_ev682v6,1564598335.0,"I just discovered this Monday that I'm a narcissist as well by watching Dr.Ramani Durvasula video on Lahwf channel. As I was watching the video, I had all the traits she was describing and god was I surprised by it. I just thought, I was depressed and was going to see a therapist ""eventually"" to get it fixed. It just turns out I'm just a fucking validation/ attention junkie been thinking about everything I did on a daily basis since I was in elementary.(21 now) Realized my dad is a narcissist and so is my sister and I'm afraid to talk to her about it.
