medical,fq8cccf,t3_gh8x1s,1589162995.0,"Hi! I had this happen to me. Within 2 days the bacteria under the filling that killed the tooth got out and into my soft tissue. Cue massive infection. Spent a week in the hospital on a morphine drip, had emergency surgery on my mouth, and was completely out of my mind with pain. The swelling turned hard and my face looked deformed for over a month.. please get to a dentist asap. I was very lucky the infection didn't get into my blood stream or bone."
MultipleSclerosis,fq7c6x4,t1_fq6ml96,1589144497.0,Thank you. That's what I believe as well. It's been over 20 years and all signs point to this. I don't necessarily want it as a diagnosis but I want to be on the right medications and have the right diagnosis so I can get appropriate treatment.

WildlifeRehab,eujqlxk,t1_euik38f,1563876728.0,"Hi so this will be long hah! I did extensive research since I had never taken care of turtle eggs before. In the first few days the embryo has not attached to the yolk yet so moving them/turning them doesn't matter. After that you need to mark them so you know their exact orientation if you have to (gently) move them. When I got them I first kept them in the box of dirt they came in,  and realized that wouldn't work. So I carefully moved them, I rinsed them off, marked which way was up with permanent marker and used a rubbermaid container filled with a vermiculite/water mix. You need to be able to make it clump without water squeezing out. I've read a 1:1 ratio and that's a big fat lie haha. I had to send just fiance to the store for more. They stay in my laundry room which is closed off from the air conditioner. It is pretty consistently 70-80¬∞ which is what they need. I also use an LED flashlight to look at them so no heat on the eggs :) They take anywhere from 50-125 days to hatch and can take up to 18 days for all of them to actually hatch out once it starts. We have a tank set up for them for after they absorb their yolk. I will feed them the same food they would find in the lakes here until they get big enough to have a chance (maybe a month I'm thinking) no more than that, I do NOT want a snapper for a pet lol no matter what my kids say. Then we will have a release party :) Heres the link with the pics

WildlifeRehab,euij5m4,t1_euiiu4w,1563848892.0,I agree. It's a homemade incubator so I can't believe 22 have blood vessels..we will see how many actually hatch though! I'm assuming like any pregnancy they can die or stop developing. I will send you pics in the morning!
WildlifeRehab,euiibfj,t1_euii55a,1563848383.0,They were laid on a construction site in front of my bil so they had no choice but to move them or they would end up killing them :(
WildlifeRehab,euidy4f,t1_euidmjp,1563845731.0,"Yes do! It's pretty cool! I have 22 eggs that survived out of 30, which is typical I guess? Some weren't fertilized. You can see blood vessels now which means embryos are growing üòä I honestly will probably keep them for maybe a month so they get a little bigger and then split them into 2 or 3 groups and release in different lakes..22 snappers in one lake wouldn't be good for the lake environment"
