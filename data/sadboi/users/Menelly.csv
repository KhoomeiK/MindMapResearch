There is both actual hypoglycemia, and ideopathic postprandial syndrome where you feel like you need to eat because you've trained your body to think it needs higher sugar than it should, and that's leading you to the path of T2 diabetes.  The first step is to get yourself a glucometer and actually TEST your sugar when you're feeling that way.  They're fairly inexpensive at Walmart.  (The cheap Reli-on brand is honestly just about as good as the super expensive ones.)  Find out if your sugar is ACTUALLY low or if it's a combo of anxiety and having trained your body to expect higher sugar levels.  Test your sugar upon first waking up in the morning.  If your first thing on waking (like before your feet even hit the floor) levels are above 100, you need to talk to your doctor.

Doctors don't really get excited about hypoglycemia levels in non-diabetics til you're under 55, and they don't get super excited til you're regularly in the 40's or so (by that I mean ""you're probably not getting meds"") but you can't figure out if you're in the first one (insulin resistance/postprandial syndrome) or actual hypoglycemia until you buy a meter and start testing."

The reality, though, is MOST of us did it to ourselves.  A huge number of RH cases are former gastric bypass patients (self included) who weren't made aware of the risk of severe RH by our doctors before surgery.  I find myself wondering if it's a chicken/egg scenario...  were we mildly hypoglycemic before, and therefore we'd go to the fridge to fix the hypoglycemia, thus making us fat?  And then you get WLS to fix the fat, and start actually paying attention to your diet like you're supposed to, and suddenly it's a huge problem when you can't fix the issue with potato chips and a soda?  I dunno...  I've wondered.

Also, hormones (for me, and several women on the RH forums) seem to play a big factor.  I can eat a Sargento Balanced Break when I'm ovulating and go 210->45 and eat the exact same thing the next week and go 160->75.  So I'm fairly sure it's my hormones, not a change in the food.  /shrug"

Fortunately, my liver does actually do its job, it's just often a bit late to the party.
