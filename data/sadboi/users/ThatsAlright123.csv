It's not lack of common ground that's the issue. It's your misleading claims, outright lies (muslims ban, re: trans policy, ""concentration camps"") that's the issue. You also keep repeating ""But rhetoric"" which is wholly irrelevant to policy, something any reasonable person understands and bringing up other countries as if they are somehow relevant to a political system within a specific country. That's ignoring Trump himself was a republican, then independent, then a democrat for over 8 years, then independent and again republican, which is beyond the point since his policy says way more about him than parties he used to align with.

People who have co-opted the right and tried to excise any sort of ""wrong thinker"" they disliked, most of them being liberals, neo-liberals, marxists, trotskyies or leftists in general, all because they wanted war and promotion of neo-liberalism abroad, something they've managed to do with help of democrats for decades and who have continuously, repeatedly given in on issue after issue while trying to get right-wingers to support them because other side is worse, and because they have the right rhetoric on abortion or gun rights but ultimately do nothing about it, are not, cannot, and will never be right-wing or in any way, shape, or form conservative.

It's why many neo-cons that have led the ""right"" left republicans when Trump came along, and either sided with or joined democrats like Max Boot, Bill Kristol, Jennifer Rubin, Jonah Goldberg, David French, or became ""never trump"" etc, with few (like Shapiro) remaining on the right but not going as far. One of Daily Wire founders in fact, Jeremy Boreing, has said he wants to preserve liberalism and it's a view neo-cons share some of which (like Kristol) have also talked about. Because that's who they are.

I think this is worth saying, so...

Who we are as individuals is largely product of various factors; parents; ancestors; gender; ethnicity/race; culture; and environment all of which has contributed to who we are either when it comes to genes, their expression, along with out limitations. Ultimately, a lot of who we are is influenced by things beyond our control, whether it's positive or negative.

Mental disorders are:

> dysfunctional pattern of thought, emotion, and behaviour that causes significant distress

And bpd is:

> characterized by a long-term pattern of unstable relationships, distorted sense of self, and strong emotional reactions

Among other things. As you've noted, you were diagnosed recently thus it's understandable why you'd feel as you don't know who you really are, but I'd argue otherwise; if you've known who you are until that point, then the diagnosis and label can't change that. What the diagnosis does is helping you understand some of your behavior and the reasoning for it, along with helping you try and change aspects that you find harmful.

Similarly, what you experience isn't less true or real than it was; it's just that some of it varies from an average person and can be harmful for you or others. If someone is for example overly emotional, for them it's still real/true, it's just that they don't represent what an average person is like (or how they experience things), and unless it's harmful to the person or others it's just variation in human behavior.

A different example would be tomboys, which is a descriptor for atypical girls that have pattern of behavior that's closer to that of a boy. And there's reasons for it, usually it's a result of prenatal hormones and at the end of the day it's just that, variation in behavior that isn't harmful but is atypical.

Bpd is similar in that way, a result of genetics/trauma that contributes to aspects of who we are and results in different pattern of behavior that's usually harmful to individual or those around them. It also means due to certain reasons we end up experiencing reality, interactions, relationships, and our own self differently.

While bpd may be an aspect of the person, it doesn't define them. Who a person is is more than that, and we have ability to change harmful aspects of it. It's not easy far from it, but it's possible.

> I only got diagnosed in January and if I would have known I would not have gotten married and had kids.

You can't change history. There's a reason why various disorders continue to be a thing. ""Psychopathy"" is quite heritable, but one of theories as to why it remains present in society is because  traits behind it contribute to higher reproductive success. If you've hurt your family, acknowledging that as you're doing is important, as it trying to do better. Regret won't help change things or lead you anywhere, it'll just make you miserable. At least from my experience. While we can't change history, we can affect present and the future, who we are, and our relationships with others.

As noted, that depends on what happens to individual tax cuts beyond 2025, as [factchecking](https://www.factcheck.org/2018/01/democrats-misleading-tax-line/) websites have noted, and:

Further:

It was you who said, specifically:

83% going to 1% refers to 1% of income earners, which isn't the same thing as net worth, in particular since the taxes we're talking about are about income.

> He banned 12% of Muslims worldwide, but the countries that he banned are obviously majority Muslim

No doubt, North Korea and Venezuela are heavily muslim countries, and banning people from countries like Libya, where war is ongoing and slave markets are a thing, Somalia, Iran (which is seen as adversary), Syria where war is ongoing, etc is definitely a ""muslim ban.""

Further, as I noted:

> Obviously, Trump's executive order went further.

At best, you have small amount of people on the left who do genuinely care, but as noted it's a small amount. Majority of them - something you'll note EPA was criticized for as well - believe in using it to get people to fight against ""patriarchy,"" ""capitalism,"" and other leftist and/or far-left things, along with race-based wealth distribution. Something [Greta](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/climate-strikes-un-conference-madrid-by-greta-thunberg-et-al-2019-11?barrier=accesspaylog) has talked about, something [co-creator](https://medium.com/extinction-rebellion/extinction-rebellion-isnt-about-the-climate-42a0a73d9d49) of Extinction Rebellion has noted, and so forth. In both cases, it's either supported or opposed based on differing issues.

At least you're acknowledging aspects of reality. That's progress.

Which was somewhat different from previous policy, but not particularly. And it happened given record levels of illegal immigration, along with rise of people using other people's children to cross borders.

Since we're talking about harm: 

> The newspaper La Jornada surveyed women attempting to migrate while they were in Mexican border cities. 30% said coyotes forced them to have sex as payment.

> The United Nations estimated that among women crossing without husbands or families, as many as 70% were victims of some form of abuse.

> [According to a report by Splinter News, as many as 80% of women and girls coming to the United States from Central America are sexually assaulted.](https://splinternews.com/is-rape-the-price-to-pay-for-migrant-women-chasing-the-1793842446)

> Amnesty International reported in 2010 that the proportion of women and girls who are sexually assaulted over the course of their journey might be as high as 60%.

Just so we're clear. That's ignoring aspects of human smuggling involved in it, crimes illegal aliens commit against Americans, and other forms of harm which you'd rather ignore while being outraged at a policy that took things slightly further for various reasons, and while pretending it's something radical.

> Doesn't make you a Nazi. Does make you someone who supports concentration camps.

[No doubt](https://i.imgur.com/pCaBaK2.jpg). Since detaining them means he (and others like Obama) supports concentration camps, when a person enables illegal immigration, what do they support? Given many women and children on their way are sexually assaulted, and given some illegal immigrants commit crimes against Americans? After all, your logic so far has been splendid.

Ben Shapiro is a neo-con. Neo-cons liking Trump, which has been happening lately more and more, literally demonstrates the point I'm making to begin with. As I've noted in another post:

> I don't consider neo-cons particularly right-wing nor conservative given what they support, how they originated, and took over the right, and endlessly conceded to liberals/left while focused on pushing neo-liberalism abroad.

The only reason neo-cons came to be is because some liberals and leftists didn't consider democrats warmongering enough at the time and enough opposed to communism. Salon's [article](https://www.salon.com/2006/11/14/neocons_8/) is decent on the subject.

> And... that isn't something a centrist would do...

As I've noted, that's false.

It's a law that wouldn't meaningfully change anything, and that isn't what you said to begin with. You specifically said:

This is one of things I'll never understand. There's so many things to take issue with when it comes to Trump, like the fact he's flipped on various issues and hasn't kept his promises. Why lie?

Yes, he called for it during the campaign. No, he didn't enact it, he enacted a travel ban on several countries, including North Korea and Venezuela. The ban covers roughly 12% of muslim population, [according](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/01/31/worlds-muslim-population-more-widespread-than-you-might-think/) to pew research. Some of those countries were present in ""Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act"" enacted by Obama after terrorist attack in Paris in 2015, that prevented people from those countries from being able to apply for visa waiver program. Obviously, Trump's executive order went further.

> prevented trans individuals from serving in the military

Which is a policy that existed until 2016. Though I have mixed feelings towards it, military is supposed to exist to defend one's country where the people most capable of doing so should be present. It's why if you have ocd, bipolar, depression and various other conditions you can't serve. Gender Dysphoria is itself a form of mental illness, as it causes the person distress and suffering, and many (even after transition) tend to have issues with depression, anxiety, etc.

> In the war mythology, the Enemy is never hesitant, never confused, never human, never fearful of us attacking him or of precipitating destructive war, and above all never ready to negotiate honestly to try to lessen tensions or to work out mutually satisfactory means of living in peace. The Enemy is always Luciferian, preternaturally cunning and evil, driven only and always by his predetermined goal to ""conquer the world"" at all costs, never honestly willing to make mutually satisfactory agreements. And yet this same superhuman enemy, according to the myth, can be stopped from his ever fermenting aggression in one and only one way: by force majeure, by the hardest of hard lines, by ever sterner ultimata delivered by the divinely appointed champion of the ""democracies"" or the ""free World,"" the good old U.S.A. And if, by some chance, the Enemy should then not really turn out to be a craven coward, and total war should break out, why then this only proves that war is the only answer and came none too soon. The lesson is then drawn that only extermination and unconditional surrender can suffice in dealing with the Enemy."

Buchanan also supported social conservatism, and was considerably more anti-war/anti-imperialism while Trump ran against endless wars, but his policy isn't quite there. He hasn't gotten US into any wars, has sought peace in some cases, but he's also supported regime-change in Venezuela and antagonizing Iran. Buchanan was fairly nationalist as well, while I wouldn't say that's the case with Trump beyond aspects of economic nationalism.

Trump has flipped on immigration, flipped on DACA, H1Bs, all he's done is try and get people to care and oppose illegal immigration, while supporting legal immigration regardless of numbers (and it's not what he ran on). It's what dems/right have done for decades, it's just status quo.

He gave amnesty to Liberians afaik, supported ""criminal justice reform"" which at least is left-leaning and he's got GOP parroting how it's needed because ""-isms,"" is spending hundreds of millions for HBUs (something that didn't even happen under Obama), etc, just off top of my head.

Further, continued existence (and well being) of society is more important than somewhat more % of profit for a person that's rich to begin with.

At the same time, you have to balance individuality of people and freedom vs well being of society as a whole. Apartment example in that case can't be separated from the rest of it; it's also more about individuals, not society as a whole.

It's actually a big issue with capitalism. Consider US for example. Other than ""need"" for migration to fuel the endless growth, everyone's constantly looking to cut costs & higher profit, and in general pay people less. It's why it's not uncommon to see companies lay off staff (like Uber) then ask for more H1Bs, or alternatively, why it's not too uncommon to see companies use their current, American workers, to train their foreign replacement (nowadays mostly Indian, with politicians left and right working to increase that). For example, AT&T: https://www.axios.com/trump-att-outsourcing-h1b-visa-foreign-workers-1f26cd20-664a-4b5f-a2e3-361c8d2af502.html

It's also why you have extremely conservative right-wingers like Charlie Kirk, argue how US should take in best and brightest from the rest of the world, something like 40-50 million people in 10 years.

Regardless, it's a big issue because it creates various issues. For one, displacing workers in that country (in this case America), brain drain from countries those people come from, which results in a circle of brain drain > more corruption > more conflict > more migration, because the reason they migrated isn't fixed but only made worse since there's less and less qualified people to try and fix it. That's not to mention in general exploitation of trained foreign labor - that is, they don't have to spend time and money to train them - which itself benefits corporations/etc but harms the countries that put resources into training their own people.

For capitalism, the ideal human is rootless individual, existing solely as a worker/consumer. There's no reason to encourage people marrying, having family, or children when you can just import trained foreigners when the current workers who spent their life focusing on it need to be replaced. That's also ignoring hundreds thousands of guest workers each year.

And that's kinda the point. It's not an aberration, it's how the system is supposed to work when not restrained by other factors. There are more and more people on the right who realize that, with conservative boomers and some neo-cons (such as Haley) who stick with free market worship.

No doubt, someone creating a drawing, saying somewhat of a slur in private years back, cheering and smiling in front of Native Americans (how dare they), and putting one's safety first, is completely comparative to her receiving death threats for accusing someone nominated to be on a supreme court, which many on left and right considered one of key things because of abortion ""rights."" Totally demonstrates they are ""snowflakes"" and over-sensitive.

Sure, I'm sure many do. Not sure what does that have to do with right-wingers. But since we're digressing endlessly, I'll just throw in [this](https://www.city-journal.org/democratic-candidates-racism-crime):

> Bureau of Justice Statistics released its 2018 survey of criminal victimization. According to the study, there were 593,598 interracial violent victimizations (excluding homicide) between blacks and whites last year, including white-on-black and black-on-white attacks. Blacks committed 537,204 of those interracial felonies, or 90 percent, and whites committed 56,394 of them, or less than 10 percent.

> In 2012-13, blacks committed 85 percent of all interracial victimizations between blacks and whites; whites committed 15 percent.

> Blacks are also overrepresented among perpetrators of hate crimes—by 50 percent—according to the most recent Justice Department data from 2017; whites are underrepresented by 24 percent. This is particularly true for anti-gay and anti-Semitic hate crimes.

Just so we're clear. Should be noted, math is off by few hundreds since the author didn't calculate it correctly; it's still 90%.

> LGBT people have faced death threats. A 9 year old boy committed suicide after being bullied for being gay.

No doubt. In fact, [a gay man](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7880357/Young-Liberal-Wilson-Gavin-drag-queens-protest-dead-Chelmer-station.html) that protested drag queens was harassed and ended up committing suicide. There were people celebrating it.

Probably laugh at the idea that libertarians, social liberals, and various others are being called -isms yet again, despite endlessly conceding to the left for decades, and because the role of white menace will forever stick with them no matter how much they bend over to the abusers that are calling them that. I'd remember Bernie supporters were at one point called as supremacists by Biden supporters, that Tulsi was attacked as Assad apologist for not bending the knee on her stances, I'd remember who's calling them that, then laugh once again and move on. Just guessing, since it's what I usually do.

> Contradicting common beliefs, National Socialists were opposed to intelligence research (Becker, 1938; Jaensch, 1938): in their view, intelligence research would represent a ‘supremacy of Bourgeoisie spirit’ (Jaensch, 1938, p. 2); intelligence measurement would be an instrument ‘of Jewry’ to ‘fortify its hegemony’ (p. 3); selection in schools according to intelligence would stand for a ‘system of examination of Jewish origin’ (p. 4), especially the concept of intelligence as a ‘one-dimensional dimension’ (p. 3) and ‘one common central factor’ (Becker, 1938, p. 24). Because people differ and therefore intelligence differs (p. 4) they called for an ‘intelligence measurement according to a national and typological point of view’ (p. 15); for Germans they asked for a measurement of ‘realism’, ‘conscientiousness’ and ‘actually of the character value of intelligence’. They were opposed to a measurement solely of ‘theoretical intelligence’, of ‘intellectualism’ (Becker, 1938, p. 22); instead they favoured ‘practical intelligence’ (p. 18).

Stalin [meanwhile](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3218245?seq=1):

> On July 4, 1936, however, the Central Committee of the Communist Party issued a decree, ""On pedological distortions in the system of Narkompros,"" which charged that scholars in the field of pedology had disrupted Soviet education by classifying vast numbers of children as ""unfit"" or ""retarded."" Affirming the strong voluntarism of Stalinist ideology, the Central Committee declared that the establishment of socialism meant that inherited traits no longer affected the mental development of Soviet children. In this context, charges that teachers committed ""pedological distortions"" directly implicated them in presumptions and practices strongly condemned just a year earlier by the Central Committee.

> The public criticism of scholars, the censorship of publications, and the prohibition of entire fields of research which followed the decree demonstrated how scientific inquiry could be made subordinate to political imperatives.

> Teachers who commented on the ""innate abilities"" of children were condemned for accepting pedologists' ""reactionary"" views on the so-called ""fatal"" influence of heredity.

> In a postwar interview, a former teacher offered this interpretation of Soviet policies: ""We were confronted with the slogan, 'There are no poor pupils, only poor teachers.' We might have a feeble-minded pupil, but we didn't dare say it out loud. I admire the system [in America] of grading pupils according to ability and putting each pupil in with other children of his same ability. [Soviets] just lump them all together, regardless of ability.""

> ""Then we had to have a campaign for 100 percent successful teaching; this was Soviet pedagogy, i.e., all students must learn because the idea that only some students should learn was regarded as harmful and bourgeois theory. We were afraid because all pupils could not learn; there was a difference between theory and practice....

There's also a decent [article](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/weekly-standard/the-breaking-of-the-quotwomens-pact) on the subject of marriage, housewives and mothers by Carolyn Graglia, which I find to be relevant:

> Feminism's most effective weapon was to marginalize housewives by degrading their role. Friedan described the housewife in The Feminine Mystique as a ""parasite"" who lives without using adult capabilities or intelligence and lacks a real function when devoting herself to children, husband, and home. Decrying the housewife's life as a ""waste of a human self,"" Friedan likened her and her fellow matrons to ""male patients with portions of their brain shot away and schizophrenics."" Housewives are ""less than fully human,"" she said, for they ""have never known a commitment to an idea,"" ""risked an exploration of the unknown,"" or ""attempted . . . creativity."" That this could be said of women, who literally create life within their wombs, indicates the degree to which feminism has sought to denature women, to reshape them in man's image.

> The stereotype of the housewife's inferiority set forth in The Feminine Mystique became a cultural truth. In 1965, Cosmopolitan's Helen Gurley Brown extolled the career woman's superiority over the housewife, whom she called ""a parasite, a dependent, a scrounger, a sponger, [and] a bum."" Featured in Time magazine in 1970 was Gloria Steinem's famous essay describing traditional women as ""inferiors,"" ""dependent creatures who are still children"" and, yes, again, ""parasites."" Those who would dismiss such statements as excesses of trash journalism should know that feminist academics equally disdained traditional women. Sociologist Jessie Bernard agreed in 1972 that the ""housewife is a nobody""; ""a woman,"" she said, ""must be slightly ill mentally"" to be happy in her ""parasitism"" of traditional marriage. Carolyn Heilbrun asserts that the housewife lacks ""selfhood"" because she fails to act ""in the public domain"" and exists, instead, as a "" female impersonator,"" simply ""fulfilling the needs of others.""

> With these assaults, feminists broke what I call the ""Women's Pact,"" which existed long before feminism's advent and, if the feminist regime is ever ended, will have to reassert itself in the future. The Women's Pact recognized that women generally fell into three groups. Those in the first are unable or unwilling to marry, or are profoundly afraid of childbirth, and will devote their lives to a career (many of them once entered religious orders). Women in the second group will marry and often bear children but -- like the aristocracy or entertainment elite -- will leave child-rearing largely to others and pursue careers or other interests. Women in the third group will choose marriage as their primary career, devoting themselves mainly to husband, children, and domesticity.

And:

>  In The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir identified another danger posed by women at home. It is ""extremely demoralizing"" for the working woman to see ""other women of like social status"" come to have very different fortunes "" through man's mediation."" The example set by women at home saps a working woman's ambition, she said, for a ""comfortably married or supported friend is a temptation in the way of one who is intending to make her own success."" 

> Thus with complete candor, de Beauvoir told us why the threat must be neutralized by depicting this tempting, comfortably married woman as "" clinging"" and a ""dead weight,"" living like (here it comes again) ""a parasite sucking out the living strength of another organism."" De Beauvoir later boldly argued that society must prevent women from being homemakers: ""No woman should be authorized to stay at home to raise her children. . . . Women should not have that choice, precisely because if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one.""

So to say this:

So, you could ignore skin color but those differences would remain, as would different groups. Even if say, most major differing groups merged new would be created, and you can see that in various places like Latin America, Brazil, etc. Brazil was once considered ""racial paradise"" for a reason, but as it turns out it was largely a myth because no such thing is possible.

Further, it's worth nothing that Europeans (""whites""), Asians, and Africans have spent 40,000+ years in isolation, and you can see evolution influencing people even within a century. For example:

> [A] study led by Dr. Kong showed that in Iceland, there has been measurable genetic selection against the genetic variations that predict more years of education in that population just within the last century.

It's also why sub-group within larger groups are a thing as well. Which is important for the point, because as long different groups continues to exist - and they will - so will the ""issues"" caused by trying to force them to co-exist within same space and compete for resources. People naturally have in-group preference, something you'll notice in different contexts as well, such as partners, friends, best friends (some thing some schools have looked to [ban](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5386439/Schools-consider-banning-best-friends-inclusivity.html)), family (which is what ethnicity/race is a form of), etc. If you compete for resources with other groups, or if other groups cause issues, you'll naturally react in certain ways that's advantageous to your group.

Naturally, exceptions to the rule exist. For example those who exploit both groups, but they don't tend to be as successful at survival/it's risky. There's a decent [example](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/16/3/7.html):

> Recent agent-based computer simulations suggest that ethnocentrism, often thought to rely on complex social cognition and learning, may have arisen through biological evolution. From a random start, ethnocentric strategies dominate other possible strategies (selfish, traitorous, and humanitarian) based on cooperation or non-cooperation with in-group and out-group agents. Here we show that ethnocentrism eventually overcomes its closest competitor, humanitarianism, by exploiting humanitarian cooperation across group boundaries as world population saturates. Selfish and traitorous strategies are self-limiting because such agents do not cooperate with agents sharing the same genes. Traitorous strategies fare even worse than selfish ones because traitors are exploited by ethnocentrics across group boundaries in the same manner as humanitarians are, via unreciprocated cooperation.

Similarly, there's a fairly new phenomenon showing that [white liberals](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8Xph1uW4AABi_5?format=jpg) are only ones (compared to other political and racial groups) that exhibit out-group preference. That in itself won't ""solve"" any issues, but out-group preference isn't advantageous in any way for the group, and you can find some examples throughout history as what that usually results in.

[Hello](https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/PSDT_03.25.19_race_update-16.png?resize=310,427):

> About three-quarters of black adults (74%) say being black is very important to how they think about themselves, including 52% who say it is extremely important. About six-in-ten Hispanics (59%) say being Hispanic is extremely or very important to their identity, and 56% of Asians say the same about being Asian. In contrast, only 15% of whites say being white is as important to their identity.

Also, friendly reminder that [white liberals](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D8Xph1uW4AABi_5?format=jpg) are the only group among all races that have out-group preference, that is, preference for non-white groups over their own which often manifests in various forms of anti-white hate or fetishization of other groups."

> condemn capitalism

There are reasons many do so.

> People say communism has never really been tried before, but it has.

So has capitalism, except if you point out shortcomings of it it's ""not real capitalism.""

> In the end, unless there is relentless propaganda efforts and tyrannical dictators, people will realize that capitalism is better quality of life and rewards them more for working.

Exploiting people.

People are more than workers and consumers. Julius Evola said it decently:

> Nothing is more evident than that modern capitalism is just as subversive as Marxism. The materialistic view of life on which both systems are based is identical; both of their ideals are qualitatively identical, including the premises connected to a world the centre of which is constituted of technology, science, production, ""productivity,"" and ""consumption."" And as long as we only talk about economic classes, profit, salaries, and production, and as long as we believe that real human progress is determined by a particular system of distribution of wealth and goods, and that, generally speaking, human progress is measured by the degree of wealth or indigence—then we are not even close to what is essential...

> When east germany was occupied of communists, they literally HAD TO BUILD A WALL TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM GETTING OUTTA THERE

No doubt alas Somalia, anarcho-capitalistic country as it has been, has no walls so many managed to escape.

> So in the end, communism needs tyrannical practices just to keep population in line. where as capitalism doesnt need it.

Tyranny: cruel and oppressive government or rule.

Cruel: wilfully causing pain or suffering to others, or feeling no concern about it.

Oppression: prolonged cruel or unjust treatment or exercise of authority.

If there's one thing for certain, is that American politicians care about their people. So much that many support mass importing foreigners, spending trillions of dollars on wars while many of their people are suffering, and causing wars which no one voted for to begin with. At the same time various ideologies are funded by rich to distract from class issues, and instead focus on how mean thoughts are bad to the point people are brought to [attempt](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/zamii070-harassment-controversy) suicide. That's ignoring vilification of anyone who is whatsoever anti-system or threatens it. Julian Assange is being prosecuted for a reason. As you can note, most of the press which is owned by billionaires cares very much about it.

> Almost all the people chanting in the streets for socialism and communism wouldnt be able to do it vice versa in a communist state, and most of them would abandon ship if they had to spend a month as a worker in the USSR.

""A different system is worse"" is not a great argument for the system you support, especially when it can be improved."

A minority, perhaps. More usually you'll find people that believe politician they support is being framed.

> I'm criticizing people who say ""both are rapists, and voting for a rapist is a morally repugnant act, but it's okay for me in this case because I'm forced to vote for one"" which is literally false.

Obviously? No one is forced to vote, the ""force"" if mentioned or ""had to"" as you've said, is not literal and goes back to the point I made, which is:

> Secondly, policy is more important than personality or ""niceness"" of an individual

Thus, ""had to,"" ""force,"" etc is forcing oneself to overlook person's shortcomings (when they care about it) and voting for them because of their policy, or for that matter, because of the other person's policy. Something that hasn't been uncommon for decades, with many being encouraged to vote for neo-cons & neo-liberals because of few policies they support, and ""forced"" to overlook their other shortcomings, especially political ones, so the other side wouldn't ""win"" and push through even worse things."

For one, accusations in themselves say nothing about truth of it. I guess you've forgotten that people are capable of lying and that, when it comes to winning politically, they'll do whatever it takes.

Secondly, policy is more important than personality or ""niceness"" of an individual. Sure, Obama and Bush were ""nice,"" but they ruined entire countries, former supported terrorists and helped cause slave markets in Libya, while latter helped kill countless people.
