But you’re right I have to think about it logically. He did hurt me a lot and he doesn’t deserve any more if my time, even thinking about him."

TEFL,fl9abm1,t3_fnah45,1584946852.0,"Don’t feel dumb and stop comparing yourself to others. I know exactly where you’re coming from. I am still saving money to get my certificate.

I would be lucky to have mine and be done with it like the way you are. I am also 23 and still living with my parents. I have been feeling the same way. Defeated. Like I’m a loser, and everyone else is doing so well. They’re all working corporate jobs with benefits and I’m still in the service industry.

But once you let go of all that you think is expected of you. You will feel so much better. Life isn’t the same for everyone and if you confine yourself to the same rules you won’t be happy. Just be glad to have what you have. You have a degree, you have a certificate, you have a family that loves you. You have more than most. I would be lucky to be in your shoes.

Keep following your dreams and I wish you nothing but the best of luck."

I’m also struggling with what the hell I should do with my life. If you need someone to talk to my inbox is open."

Parents decide to give you life and then decide to act like you're their burden. I'm sorry but it is truly unfair.   


I am in the same boat as you. I have an unsupportive family, and I was recently dumped. I am finding reasons to hang on, and I hope that you will too."

relationship_advice,ep0i5p0,t3_btfvun,1558975763.0,"I can completely relate to how you feel...I was in a relationship about 3 years ago with a guy I really loved. Then suddenly things all went to shit, and my friends started telling me he was cheating on me, which I tried to deny. 

It’s hard to believe other people when there is someone you love telling you to your face how much they love you and would never do anything to hurt you. 

Long story short, we broke up. I never got closure. I never got the confirmation myself if he actually cheated on me or not, because he refused to admit it. In the end, 2 weeks after we broke up, I saw him with another girl on social media. He had told me when we were together, he would never post his relationship on social media, so it was all very... confusing. 

Sorry to go off into my own story, but my point is... once someone hurts you in unimaginable ways, seeing that person again will ALWAYS ignite a certain anger in you. Especially in the case that you don’t have closure, you’re left questioning why you were never enough.

It sucks, dude. I’m sorry that you’ve been through that. And I hope from the bottom of my heart that you are being treated well and in a loving and happy relationship. 

P.S: your mans may just be momentarily jealous that another man can make you feel that way. Have a talk with him and assure him that you love him, and remind him that PTSD is a thing."
