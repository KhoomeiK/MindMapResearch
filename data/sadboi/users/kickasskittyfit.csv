I see you've been dealing with multiple therapists who seem hesitant about your diagnosis but that you still identify with all of the symptoms. Sounds a lot like my situation.

First of all, I'm sorry you've been going through this. Trying to capture a full understanding of BPD in any capacity can be confusing. 

**TLDR**: Find a more experienced therapist. Get *very* comfortable with a timeline of your life so that you can confidently explain how your symptoms - mild, severe, or in-between - have affected you. Intensity of symptoms should not overrule pervasiveness; if your symptoms affect how you function, then that would warrant a more in-depth analysis of possible treatment plans for you specifically. For example, I had one therapist who said I had ""traits"" before he had to pull out the DSM-IV in session because he had zero clue what derealization was. That's... not a good sign. You might be dealing with something similar which is not to say you have a bad therapist, it just means you need to find someone who truly understands BPD and can give you definitive answers about where you fit in with the diagnosis.

I got diagnosed with ""traits"" by three different individuals despite my insistence that I meet every single diagnostic criteria, up to and including debilitating derealization episodes which started in early childhood. As I grew older, these episodes actually made me fearful to start driving when I was 16 (the ""veil"" experience can make it legitimately hard to see). I have lost jobs due to emotional dysregulation. I have co-morbid depression, anxiety, and I have at times dipped into alcohol abuse as well as chaotic interpersonal relationships that hurt me more than they helped. I have also self-harmed, threatened suicide, participated in disordered eating, have been escorted to the hospital based on vocalized suicideation, etc. 

This has been happening for as long as I can remember (I'm in my late 20's now).

If that's not a ""pervasive"" disorder then I don't know what is!

 And yet, I still only had ""traits.""

I started doing my own research and decided I was comfortable just calling myself full borderline until I can meet with a psychiatrist. The key here is that I don't *have* to tell anyone about any of this. It's a personal thing and it's a personal decision for you, too. I would not consider it a misrepresentation but that's just me.

Anyway. Based on anecdotal experience and the research I've done for papers on this exact subject, I've come to conclude that BPD stigma from mental health professionals (and the public in general) has created the ""traits"" diagnosis which seems to help no one, really. 

The irony here is that BPD involves black-and-white thinking so of course I believe it should be a black-and-white diagnosis. So. Take from this what you will.

Everyone can have shades of this or that mental illness/condition but BPD is so complex that I consider it to be a disservice to diagnosis someone as just having cherry-picked traits of certain extremes included in the full diagnosis. 

In fact, [there can be more than one expression of BPD, including ""quiet BPD.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RrGNbcN8cM&t=90s) It's a nuanced disorder. 

Diagnosing someone with ""traits"" of BPD can be due to several factors (still just my opinion based on experience):

* therapist inexperience with BPD in general
* fear of client backlash - that hesitancy you mentioned (public stigma can be severe, client may develop negative outlook on prognosis, etc.)
* lowered client retention
* requirement for specialized therapeutic modalities such as mentalisation, DBT, schema, etc. which, again, points to client losses if a therapist does not specialize in these therapies

Therapists are still just humans who need to make money doing what they do. My theory is that diagnosing someone with ""traits"" of BPD means that a therapist can continue to provide a service to someone without immediately addressing the mental health elephant in the room of a more serious diagnosis, which means everyone is relatively ""ok"" for a while: A client is still receiving therapy and a therapist is still retaining a client. 

It is one way to sweep serious BPD concerns under the rug while half-treating the more shallow aspects of the disorder, such as emotional dysregulation, instead of the root cause (genetic propensities, complex trauma). For the therapist, it could be looked at as a win-win. 

(Client retention is a viewpoint I take from having had a long-term relationship with an individual who ran a mental health facility and often spoke of the goals behind keeping clients at almost all costs)

Mild or not, symptoms are still symptoms necessitating the full attention of a mental health professional if there is going to be legitimate differentiating from other mental health concerns, such as depression by itself, PTSD, etc.

I took my traits diagnosis and used that to look even deeper into my life - ""traits"" does not accurately represent the deep losses I've experienced due to my behaviors. If you feel the same way, I highly recommend preparing for therapy sessions with your personal evidence and asking your therapist for their own evidence for how they're classifying ""traits"" versus a full diagnosis. You might be surprised.

Often, therapists have little to go on with clients and they can be prone to making some broad assumptions; an hour-long session is not long enough to really understand someone's entire life.

I had always read that BPD makes it more likely that someone may behave in ways that hurt others but that it is never planned or intentional - that's the hallmark of BPD, the idea that an individual suffering from BPD is not capable of planning the hurt they may inflict.

In fact I experience my behavior as ""hurtful"" to others only later when I've had time to come down from the emotions. In the moment I feel completely justified saying and doing certain things because of how intensely I experience emotion in general.

He was fighting a losing battle with custody, too, from the start - his record is long and he had successfully hidden it from everyone until I started gathering evidence for my side of things. The testimonies against him were going to be swift and strong.

My goal is to show my son that I'm actively trying to create a better life for him whereas his dad is not as keen to do so. My son will be 8 by the time I'm in a residency program. Perfect age to learn how actions speak louder than words!"

I am back to tracking macros, eating 1700+ calories a day, and working out regularly. Took a few weeks but my body is finally coming back around to where it was about 6 months ago. So far I have actually experienced a decrease in appetite and no weight gain on Zoloft which really, really surprised me.

Even if I HAD gained any weight, being on an antidepressant is such a great feeling and totally worth it. So happy and at peace."

xxfitness,fbb7spt,t1_fbayf14,1576694963.0,"I‚Äôm so glad you found my perspective valuable! 

It might be a little different for you (as it is for everyone) but I totally stopped looking at the scale and trusted my body to do its thing. 

I started looking in the mirror every day to spot the little changes that were happening. I take full body, private selfies so that I can look back on those amazing ‚Äúfeelin‚Äô myself‚Äù days and overall, I learned to just appreciate the process. Make your bed every day, stick to schedules, set up some rules for your fitness that allow for you to enjoy life without feeling controlled. 

More than anything, what helped the most was the own the mantra, ‚ÄúThis is a lifelong journey.‚Äù

There will be times when I‚Äôm ten pounds heavier AND lighter than my weight this morning. There will be scattered days of ‚Äúwow I look super bloated‚Äù vs days of ‚Äúwow I look shredded.‚Äù 90% of the time I am perfect with my macros and sometimes I eat a freaking cookie that blows my carb goal lol. But I‚Äôve accepted all of that. It‚Äôs not all or nothing anymore.

The patience part is MUCH easier when you look at fitness as a practice of going with the flow, little mistakes and all: 90% consistency on higher, quality calories is a million times better than 50% consistency on ‚Äúdieting‚Äù calories. 

Suddenly you wake up after a long time of being one with that flow and you see all the changes (or someone else notices!!) and then it‚Äôs even EASIER to keep going!"
xxfitness,fbaxal3,t3_ecd6pj,1576688768.0,"Keep going for sure - for one, 2 months is definitely enough time to see *something* happen but not enough time to decide that the recomp is working or not, regardless of DEXA scan results (which I agree seems glitchy in your case). It's a lot like adopting a new skincare regimen - it needs quite a bit of time to judge performance.

Second, this initial weight loss is probably water weight from your first ""whoosh"" of weight loss due to carb cycling. Carbs can really mess with water retention and loss, especially if your digestion is unpredictable right now. Expect another ""whoosh""! 

Lastly, I saw that you have been PR'ing ""left and right"" which, to me, signals ""newbie gains"" and more food WILL help that. Might as well keep the gains train going: The more muscle you pack on right now, the more fat you'll shed later on and more easily.

Proper recomp'ing should absolutely take longer than 2ish months so stick with it! I did not see any results for myself personally for about a year of consistent workouts and proper protein intake. And again, carb cycling and adjusting to a new way of eating can cause some really weird weight changes until things stabilize."
xxfitness,fb6qvnp,t3_ebps4t,1576557449.0,"I‚Äôll piggyback on some other comments which have pointed out that recovery on such low calories is likely the issue as far as not recomp‚Äôing properly.

Recovery is a much bigger part of the health equation than a lot of people realize - if your body doesn‚Äôt have the tools to recover and get stronger, it‚Äôll just eat away at itself and deplete your energy until you‚Äôre in a nasty cycle of being ‚Äúskinny fat.‚Äù I have been there and it is no bueno!! 

I‚Äôm your same height as well and I‚Äôve done the skinny fat life to the point where I was once 119lbs (no muscle). 

2 years of weightlifting heavy, less cardio, and inching my maintenance up to 2000+ calories a day, I now struggle to stay at 130lbs. I sit more comfortably at 135-145lbs and I‚Äôve been told I look 20lbs less that. So don‚Äôt be afraid to eat more to help with the gains, lift heavier, etc. Sounds like your body has acclimated to your current lifts and isn‚Äôt changing the way you need it to!"

OP and most other people aren't trained to deal with issues this severely debilitating but this woman clearly needs to be approached with more empathy.

fitpregnancy,fak2v2r,t3_e989v8,1576159845.0,"So, I was almost 1000% sure I had gotten at least one tear during my water birth. I braced myself and when my midwife checked me out, she said I had one tiny ‚Äúabrasion‚Äù that would heal in a couple days and I wouldn‚Äôt feel it - and she was right. I skipped out of her center two hours after the birth feeling totally normal! 

What I did:
- worked out consistently 5-6x a week with weights (heavy ones)
- LOTS of weighted squats 
- 60+ minutes of walking daily
- 180g+ protein daily

I did not do any massaging. 

My midwife thinks the squats are what helped the most - I had tons of control over the pushing and was able to connect with my body entirely when it needed to take over - and when it did take over, I was squatting during the birth (even in the tub) which helped immensely.

The pushing phase lasted only 15 minutes - the fastest my midwife ever recorded at her center for a first time mom!

I also have no pelvic floor issues. Like others have said though, it is a lot of working with your genetics and some luck. 

Eat spinach and do squats! :)"
TrollXChromosomes,faicd7r,t1_fahtphc,1576104524.0,"YES!!! Excellent point I forgot to make!

CA was different in that they did not help me file a child support case - my abuser saw the paperwork and listed himself as the ‚Äònoncustodial‚Äô parent who was helping us occasionally. The state felt that was good enough. It was such a let down. 

Once I flew back to my parents‚Äô place and applied for Medicaid, my new state started a child support case with me ASAP."
TrollXChromosomes,fah16b4,t1_fagnjak,1576076737.0,"Agreed. Child care is a huge part of this. My abuse involved creative economic limitations which were designed to ensure that it didn‚Äôt make sense to work at all - as in, I couldn‚Äôt work during evenings or weekends (it was ‚Äúselfish‚Äù to make my abuser take care of our son in his free time) and any 9-5 I could get, I‚Äôd be expected to pay for daycare which in that area, would‚Äôve eaten up 90% of my paycheck.

I was making plans for a year to get out and was not able to make it work because of how impoverished I was as an individual under this abuser‚Äôs dictatorship. I even reached out to hotlines and all they did was confirm that yes, I was experiencing every abuse under the sun and no, I didn‚Äôt want to kill myself.

The ONLY reason I was able to get out with our son was because my abuser tried to kill me and the cops jailed him while I made my escape and used his credit card to book a flight back to my parent‚Äôs home (otherwise I would not have been able to do anything - I had zero to my name after he took thousands in tax refunds from me.)

What we need is an emergency domestic violence fund for women who DO have a plan to get out but literally cannot due to their situation. These survivors are ALWAYS making plans and really, these plans do not involve getting on welfare: Abusers gleefully weaponize welfare, actually. I was forced onto Medicaid and was encouraged to use food stamps while my abuser drove sports cars and made 6 figures - so welfare was already happening but an escape was not until I almost died at his hands.

I would gladly pay more taxes if it meant setting up some emergency rent/childcare/transportation vouchers for women who want to put their plan to escape into action."

Luckily, Zoloft and a good therapist are in my life - I can now handle things normally. 

We humans are crafty enough that we will go to great lengths to survive while simultaneously killing a piece of ourselves when we need a release. 

Alcohol, cutting, restricting an otherwise healthy activity like eating, isolation, etc. 

Mental self harm is something we should all be contemplating more often. The mind-body connection is still a big missing piece of the mental health discussion."

It makes my skin crawl to hear that people are trying to be an ""influencer"" for a living. For one, like *anything worth having*, it's just not that easy to set up an account and ?? then profit.

Second, unless you're a gorgeous narcissist, all your time is spent not only curating but editing interesting and follow-worthy content; it sounds like your partner is going to be indefinitely unemployed. Good luck making THAT interesting.

Third, social media platforms are moving away from showing ""likes"" stats and users' more publicly viewable sphere of influence. So really, this is not a great prospect for the future regardless of any other factors.

IMO you're being way too nice about this. The fact that this person pursued a degree, turned away from it to do *this* and then had the gall to say YOU were being unreasonable by asking they take on SOME sort of work in the house... big, big red flag."
