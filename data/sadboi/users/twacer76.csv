All of this I hope he can learn in time, cause I do think he has the ability and quality, it might just be growing into quite a big role too soon. 

Perez, yikes. He‚Äôs good at pressing and has great defensive work rate, but on the ball it‚Äôs a different story. He‚Äôs probably had about 5 but chances missed this season. He moves around like a slug, he has absolutely no pace to his game, and thinks he has an hour on the ball every time he gets it. For 26 (I think) years of age and a wealth of prem experience (although not in the best team) he should be much much better. 

In terms of solving the problem I think Ziyech from Ajax would be a great winger to bring in, he oozes quality whenever I‚Äôve seen him play, and is the kind of tricky winger that can spin fullbacks left and right. He has a ¬£35mil release clause too, only ¬£5mil more than we paid for Perez which kills me every time I think about it. Idk about bringing another winger in other than Ziyech tho, as at that point we‚Äôd have like 6 or 7 wingers in the club. Unless we were to get rid of some, I‚Äôd say Gray and Perez tbh."
