It was a real shock for everybody, a young kid dying is always hard to deal with. My mom didn’t get me therapy. I had been with her a couple of days before she died, and it was a wonderful memory, but honestly very traumatizing. She threw up blood twice, we talked about death, I told her I love her forever, she told me she loves me forever, I went home at midnight. The next day she was in a coma, and she never woke up. I miss her every day. It started a careen towards bad decisions and a life of mental illness and depression, and I still have a hard time forgiving life in general for taking that child away in such a brutal way. It really ruined my life. I am close with her younger sister, I was with her mom until I learned that she was abusive to the sister. It caused a huge wave in a lot of people’s lives. The school didn’t offer counseling either."
