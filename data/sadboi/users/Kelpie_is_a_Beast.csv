Another thing is that i don't really talk anymore to anybody from school. We used to be hanging every recess and after school and when we graduated they never made an effort to contact me again.

I had Demolish rune and mostly farmed my Q stacks. I destroyed inhib tower in 3 hits using Q and Demolish. Whenever someone tried to contest me i hit them so they would back off but never chased the kills since Nasus has no mobility."

You can get multiple kills but if you don't get anything because of it (turret, Baron, Drake) then it's not the best. It does matter what role you are playing too. ADC usually does more dmg than tanks for example and ADC usually gets focused more by enemy assassins than tanks. The kills go to the person who last hits the enemy so you can basically only last hit enemies and get 10+ kills while someone else does all the dmg.

This is honestly the dumbest thing i've ever heard. Everyone can suffer from depression. Depression doesn't care if you're pretty/handsome, rich, talented, have great social skills or whatever. 

You can seem happy all the time and still be a mess. Society has put a stigma on depression so most people just pretend they're fine but that shit is exhausting. Putting on that fake smile everyday just so people don't ask you what's wrong is draining the energy from your very core and makes you tired of life itself.

Depressed people can be genuinely happy too but that usually ends the moment you're not being distracted anymore from your own thoughts. I just hate how people assume you are not depressed just because your life is not visibly more difficult than theirs."

Either i have to run away from krugs or raptors because i'm about to die or i finish it at really low health, having used Smite and 2 refillable pots and some time in between to let the pots regen my health a bit before going to the next camp."
