I just want to point out that according to this article, Sweden's unemployment has skyrocketed to 11%, so it's not exactly like their economy is managing just fine by 'sacrificing the elderly' or anything. Plus, that's not even what they're doing. Sweden's making decisions based on their own healthcare and testing capabilities, and they've decided that for now, a lockdown might not be necessary to avoid overrunning their hospitals. The article even points out that they're considering implementing a lockdown if lack of adherence to social distancing guidelines continues.

We can argue which mitigation strategies are best at reducing overall risk (and to be clear, there are risks associated with staying locked down for too long too), but it's just absolutely insulting to pretend that the economy would have been FINE if we'd done fuck-all to prevent the spread. The global economy was going to tank regardless. And on the other side, with even the strictest and swiftest of lockdowns, thousands of people would have died regardless. There are tough decisions that every city, state, and country is having to make continuously throughout this pandemic based on the latest data. It's not a binary."

Definitely second seeking other support. Do you have a friend you could reach out to? Or a campus resource maybe? Especially if you're not sure you can keep yourself safe. 

One thing about college is that it's soooo all-consuming when you're in it. It's basically your entire life and future, and it can be really hard to see past even without throwing a mental illness in the mix. (I almost killed myself senior year in a kind of similar situation -- thought I was going to fail all my classes and not graduate, very black-and-white worst case scenario spiraling from there -- and now I realize that my worst case scenario could have happened and I still would have ended up fine in the end, except for the horribleness of experiencing it with an untreated mental illness.)

mentalhealth,fngfbjx,t3_g1kbnh,1586930465.0,"In my experience (limited, admittedly -- I've only been to two different hospitals, both for severe depression), there's basically no one-on-one therapy in psych hospitals. It was more helpful for me once I started thinking of my assigned counselor as more of a social worker -- their main job is to make sure you have a safe and stable environment to be discharged to. The psychiatrist meets with each patient for 5-10 min a day and might give some therapy prompts for homework, but they're mainly there to make sure any med changes are being tolerated okay. This can feel frustrating if you're used to outpatient therapy, but it's important to remember that the main goal of hospitalization is to stabilize any ongoing crisis so that you can pick back up afterwards with your outpatient care team in a much safer mental place.

Group questions tend to be generic so as to be applicable to people going through all kinds of situations. Things like ""here is a list of coping skills, what three things do you think you can try while you're here?"" or ""what do you think you could do differently to avoid going to the hospital again?"" In one of the wards I was in, literally everyone but me had a substance abuse problem on top of mental health concerns, so we talked a lot about that. 

As a side note: they always tell you that you have to participate in groups ""or else the doctor might make you stay longer"", but in my experience that's not reeeally the case. Things like sleeping all day or being actively psychotic/aggressive/violent can extend your stay (after all, they're not supposed to discharge patients unless they're relatively safe & stable), but beyond that, cases tend to have more or less a set length of hospitalization depending on diagnosis / chief complaint. Plus, counselors have seen it all and understand that everyone's at a different stage in the process. They aren't going to tattle or anything if you don't feel 100% comfortable answering every question in groups. (Having said that, I definitely recommend going to group sessions when they're offered if only because it's something to do!)

mentalhealth,flznp4o,t1_flxgj9b,1585628279.0,"I've used national & local phone hotlines, online chatroom hotlines, and crisis text line (and also volunteered for CTL last year), and honestly, I just feel so conflicted recommending CTL. It's a great service that they provide, especially since texting is so accessible when you're out and in crisis, but they've also provided the worst care of any of the hotlines I've used. I don't mean that they did anything wrong -- they're just so limited in scope with what they can do. If you're not an imminent risk case (where your conversation is supposed get handed over to a trained counselor), they're limited to just asking a couple of questions on your current situation and then telling you to go color or listen to music or something. 

&#x200B;

I've texted in with a <24h but next calendar day plan a couple times and got brushed off and told to ""just relax"", which was devastating.  And knowing how it works behind the scenes, I sincerely doubt the volunteer did anything wrong -- presumably, they flagged the convo for their supervisor, who then made the call to not escalate and just keep going with the standard responses. Because CTL volunteer training is fairly limited, they're not allowed to give any advice -- they're only allowed to say generic things like ""Well, some people enjoy listening to music. Does listening to music sound helpful right now?"", which is great if you really have just momentarily forgotten how to relax, but not very helpful if you've already worked through all your coping skills and are now using a hotline as a last resort.

&#x200B;

I know every hotline has its shortcomings, and honestly, there's only so much any hotline can do for someone who's unwell. But having said that, every time I've used a phone hotline, they were at the very least always able to walk me through my crisis to stay safe. (""Are you at \[place where means are\]? Okay, you should leave the building and head out to your car. Let me know when you get there. Do you live with anyone? Are they someone you feel you can trust? Okay, promise me you'll call them after we get off the phone."" etc. etc.) But this is just my experience, and I know I have a few advantages that make phone hotlines better for me specifically: e.g. not deaf, usually can get the privacy to talk, way more charismatic in speech than text (ugh, I hate how like a quarter of the help seems to depend on how much the volunteer likes/gets you -- OP's story is definitely an example of this), fairly articulate even in crisis, etc. Text is definitely preferable for many others. And while online chatroom hotlines exist, they don't seem to be nearly as expansive/well-staffed as CTL, and using them requires you to be at home on your computer, which is unrealistic for a crisis resource.

From what I can tell, fat activists and pro-(restrictive)ED folks intentionally follow and repost and tear down each other in an attempt to trigger themselves and/or reinforce their disordered belief systems. It doesn’t matter how common those disorders are in real life; on the internet, these communities find each other and amplify their disordered thoughts. Even if a particular fat activist has no desire to seek out pro-ED folks to use as straw men for all skinny people, they’re still going to be repeatedly reprimanded by individuals with restrictive EDs who are trying to justify that their disordered behaviors aren’t “that” disordered, or at least preferable to being fat and in denial. There are definitely many fat activists who use people with anorexia as straw men, but a lot of them do interact with people with restrictive EDs at concentrations far higher than IRL.

mentalhealth,fedumtc,t3_eonnrd,1579020247.0,"Background: I had a psychiatric hospitalization a few months ago but am feeling better and much more stable/energetic on my current meds. The whole experience was very stressful and kind of a wake up call. While I've always had an informal written safety plan, I now think it's important to create a more formal, step-by-step document to give me and select loved ones a sense of control/agency (and to make the hospitalization process much more smooth, if it should ever come to that again).

The reasons I've come up with:

- I promised [partner] I'd do life with him, in sickness and in health and all that, and I can't break that promise now.

- My cats won't understand what happened -- they need me to be there for them

- I want to be godmother to [sister's] children someday.

Truth be told, I'm even more worried that these reasons could have the opposite effect: for instance, what if my sister turns out to be infertile or moves far away from me, or what if one of my cats gets sick and has to be euthanized? I don't want to read those lines in a vulnerable moment and think, ""well, now I have nothing holding me back, anyway"".

AskReddit,f9qwmd0,t1_f9qtff1,1575567988.0,"I think (?) they usually do an ELISA first and then, if it’s positive, follow up with a western blot. ELISAs amplify the signal tremendously, but they’re also extremely prone to contamination, so they generate a lot of false positives. The western blot is more selective but also much more expensive and time-consuming. So if you show up negative in the ELISA, you probably don’t have a detectable HIV viral load, but if you show up positive, they wait to give you your results until after they confirm the WB.

Not sure what happened here — possibly they tested too early at first and the viral load wasn’t yet detectable, or there was a mix up at the lab, or the patient tested positive on the ELISA but then had ambiguous WB results that were later repeated. Purely speculating here. Someone more knowledgeable is welcome to chime in."

femalefashionadvice,exfuj2y,t3_csho1l,1566248673.0,"tl;dr: work in research lab, tips on dressing a little less like an undergrad?


Hi all,

I’m in my mid-twenties, work in an academic research lab (cancer bio), and get mistaken for an undergraduate student all the time. It’s at least somewhat unavoidable, since I’m very baby-faced (a bartender recently told me I look like I’m 17) and I have to be on campus all the time, but I know there are multiple changes I could be making to lessen this image, especially professionally.

Our lab doesn’t have much in the way of a dress code, although most people in the lab wear jeans and closed-toe shoes. Full coverage is required if we’re working with specific hazards (viruses, mice), and even then, I’ve seen people just don the required PPE over any manner of attire. One of our grad students (who, admittedly, rarely does bench work) wears cargo shorts and flip-flops in the summer, while a female post-doc (who works with mice multiple times a week) wears cute skirts with flats most days, usually without leggings. Both of these are considered fine; however, from a safety perspective, I would not feel comfortable showing skin below the waist.

My everyday work attire consists of a pair of straight-leg dark-wash jeans, a plain v-neck t-shirt / blouse / turtleneck, tennis shoes (lightweight cheap athletic ones), [basic stopwatch](https://www.amazon.com/Timex-T5E901-Ironman-Classic-Black/dp/B000AYTYLW/), wedding band, eyeglasses, hair pulled back in a high ponytail, and no makeup other than some brown eyeliner and tinted chapstick. I bring my laptop, travel coffee mug, and lunch in a [small Outdoor Products backpack](https://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Products-Crestline-24-Liter-Storage/dp/B01MZ8KUN4/). Let me know if you’d like me to message example photos directly.


Some things I’ve considered:

- Ditch the backpack, obviously. Unfortunately, while messenger bags do look very professional, I’m a small person and I really don’t want to throw out my shoulders. I bought [this cheap canvas backpack]( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NCISGXD/) to see if something like this can work before committing to a more expensive/long-term bag. Thoughts?

- Nicer shoes. I know basically nothing about shoes, so any and all advice would be appreciated! I do enjoy wearing flats outside of work, but in the lab, it’s important for my feet to be covered and protected from spills. Heels would be a definite no.

- Different hairstyle/makeup? My current look is extremely low-effort, and unfortunately there’s a lot of visual overlap between “research apathy” and “college exams apathy”. My bone structure does look especially young without my hair obscuring part of it. This question is maybe better suited for another sub though, and regardless, it's definitely not the only contributing factor.

- Grow some facial hair?? (kidding, but the stress beard did work for my fiancé)

Any other advice would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I need so much help. Even if I can’t be treated seriously all the time, I at least want to be treated my age. :|"
