I've taken weekly quizzes on a computer before that have been more secure and reliable than this. Personally I think it's fair to assume at this point that there are no actual ""cheaters"" being caught besides those anonymously reported, and that the whole thing about the students caught planning to cheat was a (poorly done) scare tactic. I mean honestly, public schools do more investigation and probably also realize the difference between planning and cheating. Planning isn't really a crime unless you follow through. I gotta recommend to you to stop replying to this person, this is possibly the worst attempt I've seen to try to sway the teenage population towards or against something, unless the goal was to invalidate the program."

At some point, I feel like tough love has to kick in to help someone keep going, along with some kind of monitoring to make sure he doesn't have access to potential means of suicide. Rehab and psych wards are more extreme, in my opinion. I was hospitalized twice, but someone should only be hospitalized if they're a danger to themselves or others and there are no other options. The fact that you know he's considering suicide is good, it's better than having no clue that anything is going on. I wish you guys luck"

I honestly don't believe she's intentionally being malicious, but is used to sharing everything with this group. It sounds like you are all relatively close, and it makes sense that she would expect for all of you to be happy for her. It sounds like there is more than one person with feelings about Mary's behavior, but I think they should be encouraged to share this with her. If it's only a moderator asking her to leave, it seems more like one butthurt person than an actual group of people who feel like they're being mocked. I think the moderator(s) and members should set some rules for what's appropriate to talk about in terms of children, establish consequences for breaking those rules, and then enforce them for everyone. If they only affect Mary, then so be it. However, if the majority of the group has voiced what they believe to be appropriate and is being treated the same for any violations, I think this would be a fair way to open Mary's eyes to hoe she's making everyone else feel or make it so there's no chance of misunderstanding if she's removed."
AntiVaxxers,fm9wvx1,t1_fm98s7e,1585878400.0,"1) This research is in one state alone, and does not provide information on how causes were eliminated or why research should shift away from genetics, as there's no information here that would make genetic research less appealing. While it's understandable that this paper seeks to gain funding for its research, that is a conflict of interest because this is meant to be a persuasive piece to gain money. 

2) This source does not give details as to how these number were obtained or how large the sample group was, which would make it unreliable according to your next source. 

3) Part of this argument is that the study was too small to be conclusive, and therefore the results should just be ignored (this study had more participants than a study you later cite, but that's a whole other can of worms). This site suggests that lack of information or support is directly proportional to how inaccurate it is, rather than realizing a properly done study could go either way. Although the author provides explanation of where researchers should be testing for aluminum, they do not provide any sources showing research on this and instead rely on hypothetical conjecture to prove their point (false hypothesis conclusion fallacy, since this article wants to keep track). 

4) Yes, this study shows a correlation between the HepB vaccine and neurobehavioral impairments. It also brings up the point that the vaccine should be altered, potentially to a DNA based vaccine. This study is actually really interesting and I'm going to keep reading their work, but as of this study they did not test to see that these results are repeated with a similar vaccine. 

5-6) I'm not entirely sure you read that study, because part of the conclusion was that aluminum hydroxide adjuvant was not the catalyzing factor, regardless of the fact that it can reach the brain. 

7) Denmark does vaccinate for Hep B but only for individuals at high risk. The map you provided is also not linked to vaccines, and does not say that all of these live births were also given the same vaccines, did not have underlying health conditions, and were given the best possible medical treatment. The map uses large ranges to shade because it accounts for these fluctuations, which is why all countries with a rate under 10.6 are the same color. 

8) A total of 15 donors were tested in that study, and no matter the method used, that's not enough people for a conclusive study, especially when they compare it to a 60 person study (4 times the number of people) and assume those are comparably representative of the larger population. There was no data saying that these individuals received vaccines. Although they likely did, the study does not provide this information even for a potential correlation trend. The study mentions that vaccines may be a cause based on animal studies, but does not give enough medical history of the subjects. Not only that, but a different method was used to obtain the mass of 1/3 of the subjects, negating the possibility of that being a control.

You can't just see those things, and sometimes you can't even see this virus because it can be transmitted while not showing symptoms. Fuck, even HIV is considered to be incredibly low possibility of transmission when the virus is undetectable. Immune systems naturally degrade over time. Once you have a virus, you essentially have it for life. Sure, you can deactivate it but if have it and come in contact with someone else spreading it? You have it again. Hand washing is effective at preventing hand-to-hand spread because it breaks down the lipid and protein encasing on this particular virus. The sudden interest is because this is a virus we don't have a vaccine for, that has a mortality rate, and *can be transmitted by an asymptomatic carrier.* I don't know about you, but that is kinda fucking scary. This sub is supposed to dissuade those fears while not spreading false information.

We also don't have nearly as many guards as it sounds like you do, since it's not uncommon for me to work 6 days a week (my job is strictly seasonal, so only during summer)."
entitledparents,f9443t3,t3_e3mlo4,1575076764.0,"Did your pool not use a system to identify people allowed in the deep end? At the pool I work at, we wristband people who pass the test and keep a written log with names, dates, and guard names for all tests administered (pass or fail). It's super tedious, especially with 700+ people a day, but ultimately saves on confusion and makes it easier to enforce the rules."

Nothing wrong with wanting time alone, but the snow isn't his fault. If he didn't know your plans in advance, he might feel like you're ignoring or don't like him, rather than just wanting time alone. Kinda sounds like both sides need to communicate more here, but nobody is displaying AH behavior."

Cello,f8nrdes,t3_e15p2a,1574650975.0,"Definitely try to get yourself some lessons for fundamentals, a good base will help you with whatever you want to learn. Have you tried playing around with the pegs or fine tuners yet? If you're a beginner and the notes aren't too out of tune, I would reccomend twisting the fine tuners (clockwise to go up in pitch, counterclockwise to go down) and maybe wait until you can see a teacher of some sort to play with the pegs. In my experience, as I started playing in middle school, it's easy to get carried away with the pegs and snap a string. Be sure to purchase rosin, you'll need it very soon if you keep practicing!"
Cello,f8nqyfa,t1_f8nlmtp,1574650679.0,"The peg then fine tuner order is absolutely right, but I would reccomend trying to keep the fine tuners only halfway unwound, so that you have lots of room to go in either direction. Personally, I tune my A string first and then tune the other to it, which might help some with ear training if you'd like to eventually be able to tune without a tuner."
