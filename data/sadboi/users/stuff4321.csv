We are considering adding a line that states that we'll let everyone know if the situation changes due to the virus, but this is tricky- I don't want people to expect we are going to cancel when it's unnecessary, but I also don't want them to think we aren't taking social distancing seriously.

AskReddit,fl5z1na,t3_fmk1ie,1584849526.0,"5 years ago a guy ran a stale red light and t-boned me at 40-50 mph. I ""came to"" in the ambulance and was asked which hospital I wanted to he taken to. I guess I still had a sense of humor because I said, ""the best one,"" and I guess they took the joke too seriously because they brought me to one that didn't have a low enough level trauma center to deal with my injuries. That is where I found out I was bleeding internally (catheter was totally red).  8 hrs after the ""accident,"" 2 ambulance rides, and 2x the tests (and the $$$), because I had to redo them at the better hospital, I was in the ICU in so much pain I could barely speak, despite regular doses of dilaudid. They determined I had a fractured pelvis and figured I had punched a little hole in my bladder with the broken bone. The next day, 17 hours post-wreck, I was rushed to emergency surgery so quickly that no one told my nurse, who I found out later was frantically trying to figure out where I'd been taken. Turns out some doctor who could actually read my cystogram (bladder xray) correctly came in and told them all my bladder had been ruptured/""exploded"" by the seatbelt (always pee before you go anywhere). And I found out that extreme pain I was experiencing the night before was the catheter poking my ovaries all night and causing me to experience birthing pains/cramps. At least that's what the docs told me the next day, I don't know much about anatomy. Going home 10 days later was like visiting a ghost town. Everything was as I'd left it that morning before the wreck and I felt like a ghost, like I shouldn't be there, shouldn't be alive. I spent time researching other wrecks like mine and found out a lot of people end up with TBIs or die, and that really freaked me out for a long time. I'm still very afraid of death."

This may be one reason we get ""bad vibes"" from others sometimes.
