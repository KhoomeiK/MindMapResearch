I've been working with my primary, who helps me manage both conditions, to wean off them one by one. The only med I'm still taking at this point is Lyrica.

My first meeting with the MFM she said that obviously, ideally, no meds is best, but she said none of the meds I was on when I conceived were huge red flags and needed to absolutely stop right this minute.

That being said, if it's one thing I've learned so far is that there are practically no meds that are ""proven safe for pregnancy"" since it's unethical to do proper test/control trials on pregnant women. Most of the meds I was on (including Lyrica) were category C (basically unknown) - and even then you have to read the fine print because since they're likely observational and/or animal studies, women are commonly on multiple medications and/or humans and animals don't always react the same way to medications. I found a recent study on Lyrica, and they said that the majority of participants were also taking other medications. So how do you know what drugs lead to which outcomes? You really don't.

That being said, many of my Fibro/ME symptoms have improved or resolved since I've been pregnant. So, it's possible that it can happen. I think it's ultimately an exercise in risk/benefit analysis in most cases."

I use compressionguru.com, but there are a bunch of good sites. The medical brands can get pricey, but IMHO they are worth it since compression that doesn't fit correctly can cause some bad issues.

Fibromyalgia,fqmzedd,t3_gjr3u1,1589486080.0,"I have Fibro and ME/CFS and am pregnant.

Unfortunately, I have a hard time differentiating between my Fibro symptoms and my ME/CFS symptoms, I was diagnosed with both at the same time.

I knew I was pregnant because I was keeping an eye on my cycle length (I have PCOS and Endo and went of BC) and I wanted to know once the hormones were out of my system so if those symptoms came back, I could talk to my doc about alternatives. I went off BC because I wasn't tolerating it, I wasn't TTC. I just happened to notice I was late and decided to take a pregnancy test just because even though I knew it would be negative. It wasn't.

Since I've been pregnant, I've really only had some mild morning sickness, heartburn, and some ""fatigue"". The ""fatigue"" didn't set in for me right away, so I'm not sure I would have known based on that symptom alone. That being said, pregnancy ""fatigue"" isn't remotely the same as Fibro/ME fatigue. I describe Fibro/ME fatigue as feeling as though your body is made of lead and the world is made of Jell-o. Every little thing you do takes 200x more energy than it used to. However, pregnancy fatigue feels like ""omg, I need to go nap right now, I can't keep my eyes open"". Before I was pregnant, I had a hard time falling and staying asleep. I've now weened off of all of the meds I was using to help me sleep and I'm sleeping better than I did before. I never napped before I was pregnant. There are now times when I just fall asleep on the couch watching TV. So, for me, pregnancy ""fatigue"" isn't really fatigue like I've come to know with Fibro/ME - it's pregnancy ""sleepiness"". For me, it is clear as night and day how different it is to feel fatigue from Fibro/ME and sleepy from pregnancy."

There's no treatment or cure for my condition, but I'm starting to wonder if pregnancy might just be it. Apparently it's common for autoimmune conditions to go into remission of sorts with pregnancy.

I've also been really lucky in terms of pregnancy symptoms. Because of my pre-existing conditions, I had a 50%-70% chance of developing HG but I haven't had much morning sickness at all (knock on so much wood).

Host: Back in Murfreesboro, construction equipment on the site of the new mosque was burned. Signs were vandalized.

Man: We were shocked. We did not expect any of this.

Host: Ossama Bahloul the Imam at the Islamic Center said he was baffled by references of attempts to impose Sharia Law in the United States. 

Ossama: The use of the term Sharia Law, and the Muslims want to sneak Sharia Law and they don't like the constitution. Who said this? I did not say this personally. I don't know any Muslims who are American who said this.

Host: Earlier this year, county judge Robert ruled the mosque and Islam presented no harm to the plaintiffs. He did allow them to purse their complaint that proper notice was not provided. Building permits for the mosque were issued in May. For all the hot rhetoric, emotional debate, even the lawsuits, when you come out to the disputed parcel of land you won't find anything. The congregation can't find a contractor willing to build the mosque, they can't even find a subcontractor willing to sell the concrete to build curbs next to the blacktop. Whether the new mosque ever gets built in Murfreesboro, one thing is clear: Muslims are here to stay.

Man: We want to live in peace the same as they want to live in peace and we are not afraid for nobody.

Woman: I was made aware that I was not a full American or not an average or normal American right after September 11th. It's like I went to sleep an American and I woke up an Arab, even though I was born and raised in America.

Host: American Muslims are dazzlingly diverse with roots in every part of the world. They're native born and immigrant, converts, and born into the faith. The community is fast-growing increasingly well-educated and affluent. In the last 10 years, terrorism and wars in Muslim-majority countries raised questions among many Americans about whether Islam is compatible with democracy. Whether Islam could peacefully take its place in pluralist America. After 19 Muslim hijackers attacked the United States, many Muslim-Americans face suspicion. Their loyalty and allegiance to America questioned. Even in communities well away from the spotlight. Places they've called home for decades. Some things don't change in middle Tennessee. They still love hot rods down in Murfreesboro, some 35 miles south of Nashville. Every Friday night during the summer locals turn out to admire dozens of fine old cars. People here say they've seen a lot of change in the decade since the attacks on New York and Washington. 

Man: I think the tragedy of 9/11 has definitely brought the country a lot closer. Closer together and has made us a lot aware of terrorist organizations.

Woman: We went through so much as a nation during that time and now it's almost like people have forgotten it.

Host: For American Muslims, the 10 years since 9/11 have placed the community making steady progress under an uncomfortable scrutiny. I checked in with Dailia Mogahed who samples Mulsim public opinion worldwide for Gallup.

Dalia: Muslim-Americans are the most diverse, the youngest, the most entrepreneurial, among the most educated, among the most employed. They look like model citizens on paper and yet many of them have said that they've spent the past 10 years telling people who they're not rather than telling people who they are.

Host: The population of Murfreesboro is up 50% over the last 10 years. It's the fastest growing city in the state with over 100,000 residents, but it still has a small town feel. With reminders of it's southern heritage everywhere. Like many southern towns, it's also a city of churches. Well over 100 churches at last count. And another house of worship, tucked away behind a car dealer in a converted strip mall, is a mosque, the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro. Like the rest of Murfreesboro , the local Muslim community has been booming. Growing from a single family 30 years ago to more than 250 families now. The Islamic Center bought land and drew up a plan to build the a larger facility, one that would expand over time. In May of 2010, the plan came before the Rutherford county planning commission. There was a bit of routine discussion about issues like drainage, and then the vote. The news took the town by surprise.

Woman: How did this happen? We didn't know anything about it.

Host: Sally Wall, a local realtor, says plans for a house of worship that size usually take years to get approved. 

Sally: We have distributed this about Sharia law as literally people here knew nothing about it. 

Host: Sally and others have become convinced that Muslims were intent on somehow imposing Islamic Law - or Sharia - in America. 9/11 has made her much more wary of Muslims, she says.

Sally: I believe that their purpose in life is to dominate eventually  the governments and the laws of the land where as we separate government and the religion and they don't.

Host: and when the county government next met, there was plenty of public reaction. 

Woman: Everybody knows who's trying to kill us. And it's like we can't say it.

Man: This is my concern, will radical ideas and violence be brought to our doorstep?

Man: I was surprised at the strongly negative response just right out of the gate.

Man: The desire of Islam is to enforce Sharia Law on the every non-Islamic country.

Man: If construction does begin I would also encourage contractors to boycott it and I would encourage the boycott of any contractor associated with the project.

Host: Methodist Pastor Bryan Brooks has led a congregation in this town for years. 

Bryan: Wildly suspicious things being said about people who have been in the community for decades. Who are neighbors and who might be people's friends or professors or doctors. 

Host: As the town divided over the mosque, two sides faced off in the public square.

Man: They're marching down Main street here to present a petition at the courthouse opposing the construction of the mosque.

Woman: You don't don't want a mosque in Murfreesboro?

Woman: No, because that's where they gather to take over America.

Woman: I think that people who protesting the mosque are scared. I think they live in fear.

Man: There's a process that has to be followed and the process wasn't done.

Host: One of the march organizers is Kevin Fisher. He's also trying to block the mosque in court. His suit had two tracks. One said the county failed to give proper notification of the meeting the other said the mosque could endanger public safety by providing a forum for radical Islam. 

Kevin: In a post 9/11 I think the community has a right to be concerned by any group not just Muslim group, any radical group coming into the community. The community has a right to release itself.

Host: While the debate simmered in the streets of Murfreesboro last summer, a similarly divisive disagreement was playing out in New York City. A Muslim group planned a new mosque just a few blocks from ground zero, setting off a national fury."

pregnant,fnzjlvc,t3_g4s8uj,1587395328.0,"I was bedbound for a bit and ended up making my own ""bath wipes"" - but you could alter the formula for baby wipes pretty easily. The basic ingredients should be pretty baby friendly.

* 2 cups warm distilled water
* 1 tsp baby shampoo
* 1 tbsp baby oil
* 1 tbsp witch hazel
* a few drops of whatever essential oils you want to add (I did this for scent mostly)

Cut a roll of paper towels in half, so that you have two smaller rolls. Put a single roll into an AIRTIGHT tupperware container (or maybe an empty wipes container? - I have this one \[3QT\] and it's the perfect size:  [https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0073CC2SQ/ref=ppx\_yo\_dt\_b\_search\_asin\_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0073CC2SQ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) ) Pour the mixture over the paper towels in the container and wait until the liquid is completely absorbed.

This exactly. And this is also why so many people think that Fibromyalgia pain doesn't exist because doctors can't figure out why you're in pain so it must not be real. For some reason, doctors have a hard time imagining that there are physiological diseases that we don't yet fully understand or have a simple blood test for.

Yet in so many cases, there is a medical condition they could diagnose, but they just bucket people in ""idk, maybe Fibromyalgia"" instead.
