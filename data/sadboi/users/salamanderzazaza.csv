If I may say too (for the op) I too fear my similarity to my parents. It used to drive me insane. ""I have this nose.  ITS JUST LIKE MY NDADS. It's ugly. I hate it."" Eventually I learned to accept how I look more because it's just genetics. Nobody picks how they look. What you do with your body and your actions means a lot more than appearances."

But I can say that talking about your thoughts/obsessions with someone you trust can help you process what is a major issue and what isn't (in most cases, it's not as crazy as you think).

Anxiety,exd2htx,t1_exbn2z0,1566165586.0,"Thanks man. Yeah the last session I went to was one I set up in order to not run away and to prevent a solid choice of avoidance since it would have been another week before  seeing her again. It really solidified my first impression. That is that her type of humor and jokes were clearly not something for me. Those anti anxiety meds the hospital gave me seriously helped. I can take them when anxiety prevents me from sleeping at night. So better sleep=better mind. 

Although, I do admit that it was a mix of avoidance and my own personal feelings towards her personality. Either way, with a clearer head, it wasn't a bad decision. 

I'll check out EMDR, too. 

And same. People terrify me now, which wasn't the case 5 years ago. I'm glad to hear you're able to keep a good relationship despite your anxieties."

That may be true! She's younger and only has a couple years under her belt. Really nice and down to earth and funny, too. Which might be why I'm not okay with letting myself break in-front of her?

Can't spend an outrageous amount of money, but we aren't living off of ramen. I'd say average. It's south of san jose, small town, but still considered in the bay. 

And I did live in the midwest for all 22 years of my life. I worked two jobs and barely made rent so either way I'd need roomies or family whether I'm out here or back home. Which I'm 100% okay with!

I seriously wish I could be more help to you or give you the right answer to help ease this pain and neglect your mother has been inflicting onto you. Parents shouldn't be like this and I'm sorry. Your therapist is right in that you should accept that she won't ever change. It might not be of any help, but one thing I always said to myself when my dad and his wife were being.. well narcissistic assholes to be blunt, is that their ideas and actions were childish and immature. I should start seeing it as an annoyance rather than something I place weight on. Again, this was something I used to cope with it as well as disassociate. The point is, you'll find ways to cope, you just have to hang in there. You're a cool person, dude."
mentalhealth,et3w2se,t3_c9vv0c,1562440149.0,"First off, don’t ever feel guilty for expressing of not expressing emotions. You have these feelings for a reason and you can’t blame yourself. You also can’t control someone else’s reactions. It takes two to make a relationship and perhaps your mom has done a lot of things to make you not be comfortable with her affection. From the sounds of it, you seem to really put yourself down. A lot. And you’ve learned to blame and guilt yourself for YOUR natural reactions. Not only that, but to overly think and attach these guilting thoughts onto yourself. I’m no professional and I’d definitely advise you to see a therapist if you are able to. I know that’s hard to do and I know how some parents are to kids who try to ask for help. But what I can say, through my own experience with having parents that constantly blamed and shamed me for my whole life, is that this spiraling is damaging. YOU are important and YOUR feelings and actions are also. They aren’t below someone else. You are allowed to feel guilty for making someone else possibly feel bad, sure, but also think about how THEIR reaction are hurting you."

I’d definitely go to a therapist about anxiety and definitely see if they can help you work through these past traumas. It’s not good to be in constant survival mode and to avoid talking to people. It will get better and you will be able to manage these fears and anxiety. Best of luck to you OP and anyone else reading this.
