However as much as a meat eater I am, the amount of animals we have breed is creating so much methane with their shit, it is polluting the world pretty damn bad, like seriously bad.

The theory is that if these farms were taken down, thousands times more of plants could fit in this space making it more efficient to grow plants as a food source.

Then there's the nutrition debate, science is making food made from vegetables have the same nutrients, texture and taste as regular meat and there are few major companies starting to sell these products, however has not gone as mainstream as it should yet, therefore not as accessible. 

For the future genetically engineered food is looking really promising as well.

Im not 100% one way or the other though, still currently a meat eater."
