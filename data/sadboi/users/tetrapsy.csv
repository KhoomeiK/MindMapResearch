Opiates are always hard to judge, especially street ones cause you don't know if it had something stronger in it like fentanyl. Good luck."

BipolarReddit,f6lhjqy,t3_drvgcs,1572945316.0,"It maybe the Abilify. Abilify was originally intended as an add on to antidepressants or antipsychotics. Im not sure why your doctor just has you on that alone. Lamictal is a mood stabilizer. I was originally on Lexapro w Abilify. Come to find out in studies Lexapro is just as affective as sugar pills, so not at all. I found an educated psychiatrist and he has me on antipsychotics not antidepressants. Antidepressants are made for people w depression, not bipolar disorder. Lamictal is an excellent mood stabilizer. The Abilify is def the issue."

The first couple of years this hurt my feelings, but I've gotten over it now. He knows how I feel about the sex situation. When we talk about it he'll get better for a short period of time, but then it regresses back to where we are now. It really depresses me and makes me feel like he doesn't care enough about me."
DeadBedrooms,f6ims4o,t1_f6hoq5g,1572881086.0,"I've tried watching it with him, but the way it makes me feel is awful. It's not that I want him to find me the most attractive in the world, I'm not naive, but seeing him getting turned on by another woman turns my stomach. I've tried to get over this, but I just can't. As far as my porn, I'm into hardcore stuff. But it's only visual simulation. The stuff I watch I would NEVER be into doing in real life. I have actually thought something might be wrong w me because of the porn I'm into. Im talking hardcore gangbang, painful anal type of stuff. The more she looks like she's in pain the quicker I get off. I would never in a million years want to try that stuff. When we watched together, he is into pretty basic porn. But the feeling it gives me is the opposite of being turned on. His libido used to be really high, so I'm thinking it has to be age. Hes 38 now. But my libido has sky rocketed and seems to be getting even worse. Im 35."
