AmItheAsshole,fmcoas2,t1_fmcnsg4,1585949541.0,"Definitely a drastic solution, I don’t even want to do that, I just needed to get a crazy thought out lol. I’ll definitely try talking to her again though."
AmItheAsshole,fmcnuwh,t1_fmcnmd4,1585949291.0,"I’ll definitely try this, thanks for the advice!"
AmItheAsshole,fmcnn0d,t1_fmchonu,1585949167.0,"I don’t want to charge her secretly, it’s honestly just a crazy thought that I needed to get out lol. But I will try and talk to her again. It’s just hard to have those conversations when you’re also friends too, because it can make things feel so tense in the house."
AmItheAsshole,fmcn8az,t1_fmcfj6w,1585948936.0,"I have, though pretty casually."
AmItheAsshole,fmcn6il,t1_fmcg65o,1585948908.0,"I’ve definitely confronted her, though in a pretty casual way 😓"
AmItheAsshole,fmcn05o,t1_fmch14d,1585948809.0,"I completely get where you’re coming from, and I don’t wanna be an asshole that’s why I’m asking lol. I’ve just tried to casually ask her to help out with like the garbage or paying bills and she never takes initiative with anything. I felt like I didn’t want to approach her again, because in the past she’s said I’m “too transactional”. I was hurt at first, because we’re friends first. But since we’re also roommates, we literally have to be transactional. 

I don’t so much care about the state of her room, but because she moved in with me at our last place she came with literally nothing. So all of the dishes are mine, she keeps breaking glasses and not bringing back my Tupperware. And when I ask she just laughs it off so that’s the only reason I go in her room. 

And no I’m not her mother, but she literally acts like it herself by not attempting to help or inquire about bills, asking for rides to work every day, and asking me to drop off her rent checks. So she makes how she lives my business lol. She’s not just a random roommate you know? 

All this to say, I don’t want to charge her. And I don’t want to baby her either. But I don’t know how to go about things when I’m called “transactional” and “robotic” for being the only one that knows what needs to get done."

WGUIT,ex0dlfl,t3_cqxle4,1565910427.0,"I came in with an AA and still didn’t get all my credits transferred over. So I’d say it definitely depends on what classes you took before and how they relate to your chosen major at WGU. I’d say just transfer to WGU now if your plan is to go there anyway! You’ll definitely save time! And more importantly, you’ll save money!"

rant,eshqe60,t3_c7taf9,1561998972.0,"He was definitely unnecessarily rude about it, but it’s hard not to be on guard when it does happen often. So I understand him feeling how he does, but there really was no point in him vocalizing it at all. Especially how he did."
AmItheAsshole,es6u8n0,t1_es6u2b8,1561657431.0,"I’m only asking for an extra $100, not $300. I pay $300 more than right now (me-880, her -550) I just want her to pay 650 now."
AmItheAsshole,es6ty5d,t1_es6tnat,1561657255.0,"No I definitely still would want her to move lol. Not even a personal problem with her, I just miss having my space. But we’re stuck for now. That might be what I need to do though."
AmItheAsshole,es6tgu0,t1_es6tbtz,1561656960.0,"So what would make me less of an asshole in this situation? Asking her to move out? Or waiting for the lease to end, so I can just move??"
AmItheAsshole,es6srqu,t1_es6rvir,1561656523.0,"Not at all, my landlord actually made her get added to my lease last month when he found out she’d been staying. She started getting mail here, and he realized what was going on 🙃"
AmItheAsshole,es6slot,t1_es6s7q7,1561656418.0,"Please see the edit, she definitely has room to get a bed. She’s just chosen not to get a bed lol. Plus there’s a closet she can use as her own too."
AmItheAsshole,es6sdtu,t1_es6qrax,1561656282.0,"I get that,  but like should I provide a bed? That’s where I’m confused. There’s definitely enough space for her to get a bed."
Nanny,er628u1,t1_er61vap,1560538389.0,Yeah they both guarantee 40 hours. So no single child rate!     $24/hr for all of them.
Nanny,er3ubdx,t1_er3u1bl,1560472890.0,"So if I ended up working 50 hours total in the week, but not over 40 for either family separately. They still wouldn’t have to pay me any more?"
