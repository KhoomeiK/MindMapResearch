Assistance,fjbtxku,t1_fjbtb1g,1583201341.0,Thank you so much. Very kind of you. I’ll post when it gets here.
Assistance,fjasrx8,t1_fjaq87f,1583179901.0,Agreed.  Its one of the reasons I stay inside more than I should.  Any loud noise or loud voice and I jump.  Without medication (minipress) at night I have nightmares.
Assistance,fja9hyu,t1_fja6702,1583169113.0,"Thank you for understanding.  Honestly it was a family member that attacked me, and made multiple threats in person and over voicemail.
He is mentally ill, but has a long history of domestic violence.

I fell apart because of his threats and broke down in the ER and ended up hospitalized for about two weeks due to SI and PTSD.  I got help, but I was super paranoid and still have constant anxiety.  I am in a safe place now, but had to just pack up what I had and leave.

The cart is probably what I need more than anything and it can be a blessing carrying anything heavy."

boston,fbkbwpt,t1_fbk576z,1576947940.0,No response from the local shelters yet. Unfortunately I don’t drive. They would need to pick it up.
