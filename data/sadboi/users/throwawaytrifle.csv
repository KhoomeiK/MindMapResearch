BPDlovedones,fm4wukx,t3_fswh2m,1585762247.0,"I think also when being with a pwbpd we become emotionally unsure. We're constantly having emotions invalidated and constantly being told we should (or do even when we don't) feel a certain way. No wonder you are unsure and questioning your feelings after everything you've been through.

I wouldn't feel guilty though. I feel like you may be analysing this too much and being too self critical. Lots and lots of people are having exactly the same reaction to this. It isn't a 'not caring' but just a case of not being able to feel much for some thing that doesn't really feel real. I think a huge amount of people are intellectually saying 'this is awful etc' but until it enters your own life it doesn't feel quite real and therefore doesn't illicit any strong emotions. It doesn't quite cross the tv or newspaper into our own personal bubbles. This is a widespread thing, otherwise the whole nation would be crying at every water aid advert on tv or feel heart break with every homeless person they walk past. Your numbness to this doesn't make you unusual or broken. Trust me."

I'll just stand in its flight path and bodily consume it.

I was reminiscing with my brother and it turns out this power would be crap. Would I be a naked superhero because every time I picked up clothes I absorbed them? If I boarded a train would I just absorb it with all the passengers? What about my home? I could never shake a hand or pet a dog ever again. I could accidently destroy a hamlet in an hour.

BPDlovedones,fm4jpes,t3_fssfri,1585755424.0,"I don't know what is right for you but these are some things that helped me, and some things that I wish I had done in hindsight:

1. as bad as you may feel, congratulate yourself. Leaving is not easy, it is right, but it is not easy. 

2. Launch straight into distracting yourself, whether with books, games, friends, fitness, it doesn't matter. Even if you really have to force yourself, do it. The more the human brain thinks about something the harder it becomes to shut off from that thing. You're literally putting down neural pathways and the less you do this the quicker it will be to move on. Bonus points if you distract yourself with something you couldn't do because of your pwbpd. Start to feel liberated. 
(With this I will add that it is human nature to dwell on things and want to find the answers. A lot of us have just had to come to terms with the idea that we won't ever really find those answers. The easier you can make peace with this the better. Understanding exactly why and how won't change the past so instead try and draw a line under it and just look to the future).

3. Simple meditation. I don't know if you've ever tried it before but meditation pretty much saved me from some dark places. When you feel overwhelmed with thoughts or emotion give it a go. There's lots of guided examples on you tube. Clear that brain fog. 

4. Invest in some self care. These relationships tend to hammer our self esteem and make us feel unworthy etc. Get a massage. Buy some candles and bubble bath. Treat yourself to some new shoes. A fresh haircut. It seems superficial but it *will* make you feel better. By doing something just for you you're subconsciously telling yourself you're worth it again. 

5. Try to keep yourself in a routine. Don't stay up later than normal, don't stop eating, don't skip that shower...it's scary how quickly things can avalanche to a depressed state when these tiny anchors of normal living are ignored.

6. Set a personal goal to work towards. It really doesn't ever have to be anything huge. Something comfortable to you that will occupy you and help you see progress. Progress in any area can be very self affirming. I took up ukulele with the aim of learning a particular song. 

7. I know it seems counter-intuitive but don't do what I did and become semi-obsessed with bpd. Don't spend time on this subreddit for example. It is here when you need it but reliving it all, over thinking it, all of that, does no good. You need to get away from bpd, as you did your bpd person, not intertwine it with your life.  

8. You've taken the first step to the rest of your life. You'll feel their absense but look at it as a hole to fill with new possibilities. And of course, if you get stuck  then therapy can be an amazing tool. 

I'm proud of you and you've got this.

Edit: also, if you haven't already, you need to go nc. I have never seen a positive outcome from people who break up but remain in touch. Nc tends to happen in the end anyway. It may seem harsh but it is absolutely the right thing to do for yourself."

They instinctively *have* to make distance and drama. If one method doesn't work they are more likely to find another. And if there is no other outlet then it is likely they'll just find someone else the arguments *do* work with. 

I have realised that what I had was both a fantasy and real. It was real to me, the relationship was my reality and my feelings were authentic....just they were built around a person who wasn't really there.

My boyfriend and I were at a friend's house and as we were leaving we had a bit of a spat. Our house is only a 10 minute walk away so in a bit of a huff, whilst he was just saying his last goobyes,  I started walking home knowing he must be less than a minute behind me. I walked down the roads, waved through the window at the lady in the local takeaway until I was 20 feet from my house. When I looked behind me he wasn't there and I felt kind of embarrassed that I had stalked off so I thought I'd  go back on myself until I bumped into him. At every turn I thought I must have encounter him by now. I walked all the way back to our friends  house (so it must have been almost 20 minutes I was away) to find him still on the doorstep and *still putting on the same shoe as when I left!*. I confusedly asked what was going on at which point they all noticed my shock. When I explained that I had just walked home and back they laughed with furrowed brow and were utterly confused telling me that I hadn't gone anywhere. I stopped insisting that I had been gone for 20 minutes fairly quickly because it became apparent that they thought I was pranking them, was lying or was mentally ill. I haven't brought it up since but I know I walked home and back that night. Also I'll add we weren't on drugs and shared a bottle of wine between three."

You shouldn't  accept the abuse regardless of how it presents itself or what the rest of the package is like.

In fact he is *still* seeing a therapist. Only long term therapy has a chance of improving bpd so in a way take solace in the fact that your separation may well have been the fire for him to work on himself. Therapy is also more effective when the pwBPD is away from the triggers and pressures  of  a relationship.

Childhood trauma is generally accepted as the most prevalent means to create pwBPD. So I think it is possible that some cultures will have no/very marginal cases of bpd.

BPDlovedones,fl0bghl,t3_flpta8,1584700060.0,"I think your answer is in your question itself. Put simply, don't move countries to be with someone if you have to question the possibility and extent of  their abuse. Any expectation of abuse should just shut down this option immediately. I'm sorry, but that is the truth of it. 

But to answer your question, pwbpd are very similar but when it comes to how abusive they are then they are like anyone else. Some are violent (I don't think this is skewed particularly to any gender) some are ""quiet"" types meaning the abuse is a lot more tempered down and happening ""under the surface"" and then there are explosive types, screaming etc. And any combination of these. The one guarantee you have is that they *will* in some way abuse you. 

Ask yourself why you are willing to settle for that? Why you will accept a certain level of abuse. I'm telling you, you are worth more than that. 

And one more point: someone with many relationships under their belt is a red flag especially when they have bpd. People with bpd often have a tendency to move  from relationship to relationship and each one tends to have the same cycle. Idealisation followed by splitting followed by break up. It is messy and crushing and definitely isn't secure or stable.

Definitely look around the forum at the experiences here and get the picture of what bpd is like to live with. And what it does to those who were unlucky enough to encounter it."

If we say that God gives trials and tests then there is a purpose. I would assume that purpose is for personal  and spiritual growth. A marriage with a pwbpd is the opposite of that, you will be ripped down and reduced by them over time in every way. 

But the experience of going through this *and* taking back your life *will* make you grow as a person. So many of us have learnt important lessons within this experience. If bringing a pwbpd into your life was a trial or test by God I can only see it as one you are meant to conquer...not one you're meant to suffer through.

awfuleverything,fjy9s5j,t1_fjxk3ho,1583692565.0,I think it's by the YBA artists dino and jake Chapman. It's quite interesting stuff when you read about it.
awfuleverything,fjy9maj,t1_fjxxljl,1583692478.0,"If I'm right it is by the Chapman brothers. Other examples of their art include a wall of nude child statues with penis noses. When interviewed and asked 'how can you do this to children?' They responded that they weren't doing anything to children, that their sculptures are more closely related to lamp posts. It's just inate material. 

But it is meant to shock. It pushes what happens in commercial industries like advertising just one step further whilst making fun of the backlash against them when, as I say, the art doesn't hurt anyone or anything unlike the industries they are targeting. 

A lot of it also evolves around Baitaille-an philosophy about the primitive violence and repression of human nature."

And when it does how they look is the least important thing to you, just like how how your friends look doesn't matter in terms of your feelings towards them. 

I had my current dog from a puppy. It's a breed I haven't had before. And when she got out of the puppy stage I realised she is pig ugly. She really is an ugly dog. And it just makes me love her more. I adore my ugly slack jawed yokel hound. Because I love her little puppy soul and personality."

AskReddit,fiu361v,t3_f9rbri,1582734355.0,"Mine started really when I was 15. I was always a little strange at school (finally diagnosed aspie at 24) and my art teacher took me under her wing. I  think she felt sorry for me and was interested because I had talent for her subject. I would go to her house, stay over, visit galleries, help her with her exhibitions, contribute my work in her exhibitions. She was seeing a guy who was equally as friendly and accepting of me.

It started gradually, he would put his hand on my knee when he was driving me home (I'm female) or be overly complimentary about my looks/clothing. Well, I was young and sheltered and didn't really understand that I could say no. I had (have) some issues with people who I see as authority and my own agency...as in I will follow what they want/say. Things turned sexual after about 6 months. I didn't like the things we did but let it happen. I was scared that if I didn't I would lose them both.  He would sneak into my room when I stayed over or drive me out somewhere. I'm not sure to this day whether he told her in the end or if she figured it out, but one day he just kissed me right in front of her. I pushed him away angrily  (at the time she was the most important person in my life. Home life wasn't good and she was like my best friend and second family) but she calmed me down and told me everything was fine. That night we all shared a bed.

It went on for almost 4 years. When I went away to university they would visit me. I have a lot of quite fucked up stories. It ended when I drunkenly told my sister. I was cracking up. She told my parents who ""visited"" them. And that was the end of that. (It's quite a bit more complicated but that's the gist).

Edit: and just because people on this thread seem interested in ages, she was probably early 40s when it started and he was 56. I know that specifically because my dad and him were friends at school (same year)."
BPDlovedones,fiq17n6,t3_f91uma,1582631473.0,"I completely understand. It's like they shaved little pieces off you during the relationship and now you're not quite yourself anymore, not quite whole.

And the rubbish thing is some of those pieces really are gone for good. I'll never trust like I used to, my naivety is gone (which is horrible because I liked it) I don't listen to my heart the same way and let my head direct me first...

But. This can be a good thing too. I can't get those pieces back but I can stick some new pieces on and fill the holes. I can't be who I was pre relationship with bpd but I can decide who I want to be in the future and work towards that. I can be better than the person who let another half destroy me and who felt they deserved it.  It's a gift that you have and they don't. The ability to change and rebuild.

It's really hard, I know. If you haven't already get some therapy if you can. Force yourself into new situations. Think about people you admire and work out what you like about them. Learn from them. Try some new activities. Meet new people that bring positivity into your life. It's rubbish what they do to us, it's rubbish that we have to dig ourselves out again, but it really is the only choice and what other option is there?

She third wheeled us in increasingly strange ways. She would just turn ""bump"" into us with frightening irregularity and sometimes at places that made no sense, like once at a castle 20 miles our from our city. She'd kind of just fall into line with us and followed us around in mostly silence staring at her feet. I was only 17 so wasn't sure how to politely tell her to duck off.  She looked completely normal, she was quite overweight and gave off the impression   that she had probably been picked on and bullied most of her life, if you know what I mean. 

One day she calls my boyfriend telling us *we* had to meet her in the square. When we get there we see her being put into a police car; when she sees us she begins *screaming* my ex's name. The police wouldn't tell us anything and they drove away.

Later that evening my ex calls to say the police had come to ask him questions. It turns out that that morning she had stabbed her disabled mum 20 times with a kitchen knife. She had called herself in and then come to meet us. She still had the knife. 

We're fairly sure she was in love with my ex but don't know if the knife was for me or him or her or for nobody. 

She got 15 years I think and wrote to him for a while."

However, if one person in a shared household isn't on board or it is just not practical (as in the case with OP's dog and finances) it is quite selfish and not respecting or prioritising their partner. I would love to bring home every stray I see, when I have my own home to myself I probably will. But I wouldn't put that on a roomate.

addiction,ff8k7kp,t1_ff8806y,1579682401.0,"Not an addict. My boyfriend is though and it feels like he could have written your post. The only thing I've ever told him about his addiction that got through (It might not to you and you'd be quite right to tell me that I don't know how it feels  to be an addict anyway and to bugger off etc but in case it helps:) I'll write it pretty much how I said it to him:

You are self-centrered an narcissistic. Addiction has made you that way. And I don't mean because you value your high over anything and everyone else, I mean because of the hate you carry for yourself. It's a certain kind of arrogance to think you especially are so awful you should just die or ""don't have a reason to live."" Do you think most people really have a ""reason"" to live? Of course not. People die and life goes on. None of it really means anything. Living life isn't about a motivation to live. But you have life, one day follows the next, so you just plod on like everyone else. If you stepped out of the self-hatred that you cling to, hey, because at least it makes you feel special in a strange fucked up way, you'd be able to look around enough to get that you are just like everyone else really. And when you realise you're just like everyone else and truly accept it you might be able to look at your situation with outsider eyes, without the hatred and personal vendetta of self destruction, and just see the absolute waste your addiction is causing. There isn't a meaning to life so all you have is the time and the choice of how to spend it. Why commit everyday to the same thing, chasing the high, feeling the same hatred etc. So instead of sitting around hating and trying to find motivation and reason to change why not just do it because why not?

There was no reason for your drug use, there never actually is, so stop looking for some high and mighty reason to stop or stay clean. Just do."

Can I ask what kind of support systems he needs in place?Would it be detrimental to support him from the side-lines? To be there for him but with the relationship on hold, as it has been for the last few weeks. I know at the very least our lives must be separate. 

As to whether I'm invested or not, I don't know. I'm angry and hurt and upset at him (obviously I don't tell him these things) and sometimes I wonder if it's more about wanting the hurt to end rather than a lack of love. I was with him before the drugs took hold and I can say that I have never loved anyone more in my life. But since then ive been chipped away at for such a prolonged period of time. I feel like he stole our future from us. I'm also scared that in another 5 years I'll look back and see it as a waste of my life. But what if he can get back to good?
