Good luck!"
Empaths,fmmso33,t3_fw21t4,1586211315.0,"First off, I was just talking about this polarity the other day so this fascinates me! 

I have always felt emotions very strongly so early on I learned to detach from them. Then I couldn’t get them back for a while. But therapy, meds, and a messy breakup put me back in balance.

For me, emotions are kind of like colors and sounds. They are part of the landscape of my life. They give it texture and meaning and make it dynamic. When I am with other people I feel their emotions, but sometimes without understanding the context of their lives, it is confusing. Like it could be “I am suddenly feeling so heartbroken- is this over my traumatic relationship with my mother surfacing?” and it will turn out that someone close to me is deeply in emotional pain.

It’s kind of like the analogy of having a million tabs open and you’re trying to figure out where the music is coming from. But when you get used to identifying it, it’s actually pretty cool. It is a useful skill as well as a helpful skill, meaning that it helps me navigate through my world as well as serves as a tool to help others. It makes me a better support for people, and that makes me happy to help.

Feel free to not answer, but I have a sibling who I strongly suspect has ASPD. I know I can’t expect him to act like I would. But I do care about him and want to help him. If it were you, what would be a good healthy way someone could reach out? We have had a very tumultuous relationship in the past and I want to set boundaries but let him know that I do care about what happens to him and I’d like to be supportive when I can. Thank you!

Edit: also forgot- pretty much gives you a built in bullshit detector that is pretty fucking accurate once you learn how to use it (i.e. listen to your intuition and feelings) haha so that’s pretty cool"

Personally, I still have an interest in kink but have stepped back from pet play a lot because that still feels specific to that relationship.

My point is that is will get easier with time. I was still devastated a month out. Not 100% yet but doing better. Let yourself grieve and feel and don’t push yourself to be into kink in the future if you don’t want to.

Took me forever to become okay with the fact that when I hear the word “mother” my definition is vastly different than a lot of other people’s. So when a friend/coworker/etc... tries to tell me I should reach back out to her or give her a break because she’s my mother, I have to remind myself that they’re picturing their mother, not mine. My usually default response is “I’m glad that, for you, your mother is the kind of person it’s hard for you to imagine not speaking to.”  

And I absolutely 100% mean it too. I am very very glad they have that. But phrasing it like that is a way to defuse the situation calmly and gently remind them that the image they and have the emotions they feel thinking about their mother are very different than the reality of the person you’re living with."

The grief I felt from the relationship with my mother was too much to face so I opted to feel nothing and struggled to assimilate that into my life as an empath. Lots of crazy push/pull, hot/cold, fucked up energy and behaviors. Finally quit drinking to get my life together for a few years, and dated someone for a spell that helped me reconnect with that empathy. In the time since I’ve tried to make amends with the people I hurt and accept fully the ones who don’t want me in their lives anymore.

infj,fclqkrk,t3_ehqlef,1577754059.0,"Not to wax horribly spiritual here (and feel free to disregard if desired) but I’m an INFJ and have had a connection that I feel intensely strongly about that has spanned for half of my life so far (they’re an INTJ). I would say connections like that are intense and rare in any lifetime. There are also many common traits between the INFJ personality type and people who identify as clairsentients, highly sensitive people, and empaths- all of which are more prone to feeling and recognizing the intense emotional/energetic/spiritual pull of those special connection with others. So it could potentially be that others have spiritual bonds like that but as INFJs (and any of the aforementioned labels listed) we feel it very intensely. But it may also be that we are categorized as INFJ because of those special sensitivities, and are more sensitive to feeling, recognizing, and understanding those larger energies that dictate soul connections and the flow of events through time. 

If you’re into that sort of thing I guess. For me, I know I have always struggled to convey the depth of feeling and the way I get lost in my head reflecting on it. Trying to appropriately convey to someone deeply special exactly how much they mean to me often feels frustrating- like I could go through all of the words in existence and it would never be enough to show them what I mean. My advice would be to use your intuition and wait for the right moment, but to say it and understand that it may never completely convey everything you feel but that it will be enough. People that special to us tend to know us well enough to know what we mean. Best of luck 🧡"

Linking arms, finding reasons to sit near them or get close to them, touching their shoulder playfully, etc.) it’s usually to feel out the territory and see if they’re interested. And I want to be clear: not every woman or every INFJ or every INFJ woman is like that! That one in particularly resonated because I don’t love strangers in my bubble so if I’m going out of the way to use playful touch or accept it, it’s a sign you’ve got a good shot.

BreakUps,f6y6hvf,t3_dib01r,1573269165.0,"Lying is inherently disrespectful, even if we don’t mean it to be. It’s hard to accept but when we hurt someone, the respectful thing to do is to let them heal. To let them do what they need to do to feel better. Everyone has their own boundaries and even if something like that wouldn’t mean something to you, it meant something to her. It can feel crappy, especially when you try to do the right thing and come clean, but when we really hurt someone the best thing we can do is apologize and accept their enforcement of their boundaries as they engage in healing- even if it doesn’t include us. 

I’ve been on both sides of the equation and it’s no picnic. I’ve come clean to friends over poor decisions and lost friendships. I was so confused because what happened didn’t seem that bad to me. If the tables were turned I wouldn’t be upset. But I hurt someone close to me and that’s all that mattered. It changed the way I looked at friendship boundaries for the better.  I recently broke up with my long term partner, in part, for repeated incidence of lying. He told me over and over that he was sorry. We tried to work on it for the better part of nine months.  It just destroyed all of what we had. So while there’s nothing he can say to undo the damage, in my mind it would be respectful and pay homage to our relationship if he takes this as a learning experience, and uses it as an opportunity to grow. If she doesn’t want to get back together, try to make it up by working on you and moving forward with integrity and positive growth. Good luck in the future mate ✌🏻"

relationships,f6vek4u,t3_dstlpn,1573183991.0,"So this may seem jaded but I just had to break up with my fiancé who I was with for four years for this very issue. From day 1 I also had that gut feeling that he wasn’t telling me the truth. For the longest time I didn’t have any proof, but little things just wouldn’t add up. And I was hesitant to bring it up because otherwise he was pretty good to me.

About ten months ago I couldn’t fight the instinct and I crept on his email and google drive. I know it’s wrong and I do feel bad, but it turned out to be the right decision at the moment. He had been lying about so many things since the beginning. We tried to make it work for the last ten months or so, but had to call it quits.

The thing is that we would have talks where I’d sit down and bring it up with him gently. And he would tell me part of the truth, but still maintain part of the lie. Or sometimes he would just straight up lie. And at first I’d feel relieved. But then within a day or so that nagging would come back. Once he and I split up I didn’t feel that nagging in my day to day life. My intuition had been right all along but I wasn’t listening because I wanted the pretty lie he had made all along than to have to confront the reality of our relationship.

My point is (and sorry it took a while to get here haha), if after getting calm and centered and thinking about it, you still feel that instinct, bring it up. Calmly explain that you had a weird feeling and you wanted to talk to him about it, rather than let it build and make a mountain out of a mole hill. Take note of his tone, his body language, his pauses, and his eye contact when he’s talking to you about it. Sit with what he said for as longneck as you need. Breath deeply, and try to detach yourself from how you feel about him or any fears or anxieties you have about the situation. From a higher, more detached perspective, ask yourself- Do I think he’s being honest? Trust the answer your gut gives you. In my experience, you already know. Sometimes things really are just coincidence and anyone who’s telling the truth will understand needing to satiate a gut instinct curiosity. If he is defensive, or vague, or shifty, or even overly detailed, chances are he’s hiding something. Again, trust your intuition!!

I hope this was helpful and I wish you the best of luck! I hope it’s just a misunderstanding, but if not, I hope you can get something out of my experience- if I had listened to my gut years ago I could’ve saved myself a lot of disappointment and heartache! Good luck!!!"

It makes me wonder if the grounding I was doing has been working so if they had to go through my dog’s subconscious (because I’m very attached to all of my pets on a deep emotional level) to try to make a connection with me. The weirdest thing is that not long after the dream all of my pets got up and started freaking out. My dogs went downstairs and started staring out this window in a dark room at nothing and barking their heads off. The cats started circling around me, looking back and forth everywhere.

Another big difference is if only one person was affected in all of these situations. In a situation like the risks associated with a car crash or either party in a sexual relationship contracting an STI, both parties are vulnerable to the risk. Whereas in the situation of pregnancy, only one party involved is vulnerable to the full brunt of the consequences.

raisedbynarcissists,f0lui4j,t3_d5ald4,1568729870.0,"Same thing happened to me. Told my therapist about a time my NMom had broken into my house and pretended to be a murderer while I was locked in the bathroom to shower. She was more horrified when I was. When she suggested I journal more about what happened I wrote this open letter to the good parts I remember about my mom. About how I’ll always love and miss those parts but how I couldn’t keep hurting myself by being around her. How I’ll always honor those good memories because in doing so I honor my own ability to love, even if I loved someone who would never love me back. I looked up and she was crying and I immediately felt awkward. 

I’m sorry to hear about your NMom. We’re here for you; you’re doing a great job!!! 🧡"
BreakUps,f09dv96,t1_f08yvf4,1568499053.0,Thank you so much for saying that; it actually helps a lot. I’m just trying to do what it takes to get by. I feel like I’m always a minute away from drowning
BreakUps,f088us1,t3_d41816,1568477454.0,"I needed this so much. We were together for four years, going to get married. Broke up three days ago. I’m packing up my stuff today. I feel like I’m going to die looking through all of our life as I put it in boxes.

I put everything I had into this relationship. So much time, money, effort, and intense emotional investment. I feel exhausted and fundamentally drained as a person. The kind of empty where starting over again will mean being a different person completely. 

I needed to hear, as I’m sitting in a pile of my stuff waiting for my dad to drive the UHaul over, that maybe it will be okay. That this is what has to happen. So thank you for sharing, because I feel like I’m holding onto anything to get by"
CysticFibrosis,ezen69k,t1_ez5317z,1567866172.0,"Woah, I am the youngest of four with three older brothers, and my family also didn’t want to talk about it! My brother had a lot of behavioral issues so that burnt them out a lot.

In my opinion there are definitely benefits and drawbacks to acting like there’s no problem. I think when you’re a kid and looking to your parents for context there’s something to be said for a positive “you can do it!” attitude. 

However as a result, my parents rarely encouraged me. Which was hard for me because I didn’t know how to emotionally understand my CF. So going to clinic was hard and having GI attacks at school was embarrassing and that isolation from my peers felt awful. And my parents never really addressed any of this and the support and encouragement to keep doing things I need to do, even though it was hard, would’ve been appreciated.

I also got to adulthood and realized that having control over my healthcare was amazing. My parents didn’t really check in or advocate for me in medical settings and it felt really traumatizing. Turning 18 for me meant freedom because no one could do something to my body without my consent ever again. But the other side of that smacked me in the face at 26 when I got booted off my parent’s insurance. I was very fortunate to have a job that offered it. But it was a job I hated, and I began to feel trapped in a life I didn’t want in order to keep myself alive. I took a nose dive into a serious depression for about four months as a result.

If I had to sum it up I would say: just be in your daughter’s corner (which is sounds like you already are, so keep up the great work!!!). Remember that a time will come when some aspect of CF is hard for her. And it may not be what you expect. Let her know that you’re there to support her in however she needs. My mom thought I would struggle most with the concept of death, and need to be angry about it. She would try to get me to shout at medical staff if I felt angry. But that’s not what I wanted to do. I wanted to cry. I wanted praise and support for doing the tough stuff. I wanted to get to actually talk about what I felt about my CF and not feel like I was feeling the wrong way. It’s so so tough to navigate having CF and being in a CF family. Everyone is so different and handles it so differently. The best you can do is just be there. She will love and appreciate that.

Good luck!!!!"
