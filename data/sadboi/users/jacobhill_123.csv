bipolar,fmeomn9,t1_fmcp8lx,1586009906.0,I haven‚Äôt asked but my guess is that mixing the alcohol with my meds is a bad idea. I‚Äôm on trileptal and cymbalta.
bipolar,fmeohmz,t1_fmctnva,1586009807.0,"Yeah, my psychiatrist doesn‚Äôt recommend either obviously. But I learned a long time ago that weed had only positive effects on my mental state. So even though I quit for a while, I eventually started again and it has helped me. With the current lock down situation, and I live in a state where it is not legal for recreational purposes yet, it has become harder to access. Bu

Drinking became an issue primarily because once I started I would not stop."
bipolar,fmbwqeh,t1_fmbvo3b,1585934626.0,You‚Äôre probably right. This quarantine just has me stressed.
bipolar,fe2l1jf,t3_eng9ha,1578839734.0,"Looks yummy.  Thought about being a vegetarian this morning, this I saw this. All over the place as to what to do to start eating right. I know I need and wanted to start cooking more though."

Anxiety,f7ml2di,t3_dwqtwg,1573866245.0,"I felt this way when I told my big brother today that I have BD. I really do and I was just diagnosed earlier this week so I thought he should know, but for some reason, I was afraid later that he was wondering if I was trying to get over on him somehow, when he had been totally concerned and showing how much he cared. I really just want him to know, and maybe a little support...brain just playing tricks on me I guess."
Anxiety,f5a622w,t1_f59xapi,1572101110.0,Thank you. Good luck on Monday. Enjoy your weekend
Anxiety,f59wi91,t1_f59usz9,1572096587.0,"Thank you, much appreciated"
Anxiety,f59wcjs,t1_f59t0jh,1572096510.0,"Try to Get some suggestions on really funny movies that will take your mind off things. That‚Äôs what I do. 

I was sick last weekend and super depressed after hearing about deaths in my family so I flipped the channels laying on the couch. I ran across reruns of Parks and Recreation (a show I love and have seen every episode of) and before I knew it I was busting a gut laughing at jokes I‚Äôve heard time and time again before. I forgot about everything that was on my mind without even trying. Then episodes of The Office came on which I‚Äôm not as familiar with but was just as funny. It was cool to get to know some new characters and get caught up in a new world. 

That‚Äôs what works for me but it may be different for you. Is there anything you like...no...LOVE to do that might help?"
Anxiety,f59vi1q,t3_dndkh2,1572096128.0,"I‚Äôve been ghosted too. By good friends I‚Äôve known for years, and by people I barely knew. It hurts. 

Not sure it helps, but like someone else said, the truth is, they are probably not thinking about you. They ghosted so that they wouldn‚Äôt have to think about you. The likelihood they get back in touch one day is slim, and if they do, remind yourself that you only have to engage with them as much as YOU choose. Remind yourself what they did and how you felt when they left so you don‚Äôt get tricked into trying to reconnect beyond a simple ‚Äúhello, hope all is well.‚Äù 

You deserve people in your life who will treat you well, and trust me that those people are out there. The friend who ghosted you just made room for real friends in your life when they left and taught you a valuable lesson about what true friendship is. You will be okay!"
Anxiety,f59ukep,t1_f59tm2a,1572095710.0,Thank you. I really appreciate that advice. I will take moments for myself. Trying to stay present and take care of myself today.
Anxiety,f59tyji,t3_dnca8m,1572095437.0,Forgive yourself. You are not the things you have done. Forgive the person who did those things and let them know that it‚Äôs okay because they are making better choices now.
Anxiety,f59tktp,t3_dnagh6,1572095285.0,"I felt like that just the other day. Literally...Thursday. I was in my car at a grocery store parking lot, crying my eyes out just asking whyyyyyy am I here?? I got it out, grabbed some fruit from the grocery store, eventually came home and fell asleep. Hang in there and try to believe that it really will get better. You‚Äôll figure things out, you‚Äôll see what your purpose is. And it might come to you, all of a sudden, without any effort on your part. Who knows? :)"
Anxiety,f59snqm,t3_dnb31y,1572094888.0,"Anxiety stops you in your tracks. Most likely you‚Äôve accomplished something in your life up to this point, which should tell you that you‚Äôre not a lazy bum. You‚Äôre just going through a rough batch"
Anxiety,f59sg8x,t3_dncctm,1572094785.0,Can you watch some movies?
Anxiety,f59s9n4,t3_dndi0m,1572094691.0,Bartenders have hard jobs.  Not saying it‚Äôs right to be rude or that you or your gf did anything wrong. Just saying bartenders tend to be cranky especially if the bar is busy and crowded. Try not to take it personal?
Anxiety,f59p2j4,t3_dncly3,1572093222.0,"Are there other dating sub-Reddits or only one? If there are others maybe you can try again there. Better yet, sign up with with another email address and give it another shot on the same one. Creating multiple accounts might be frowned upon in some communities so be careful and make sure to read the rules first. 

Either way, I think you‚Äôll be able to bounce back somehow. Dating is a long process and takes time in any environment. Be patient and it‚Äôll all work out. Hang in there!"
Anxiety,f58s7ut,t3_dn8pjp,1572062822.0,"I hope you feel better soon. That sounds like a  really hard and scary way to live/feel/think on a regular basis. I can relate to everything you said so believe me when I say that I wish there was something I could do or say to make it better for you. I have those exact same feelings all the time. 

I‚Äôve been thinking a lot about intentions lately and what trust really means. No answers yet but I‚Äôm trying to believe the positive over the negative. Somebody out there cares about and loves me with no bad intention, or will one day if not the case right now. I have to believe that, otherwise I‚Äôm forced to believe that ALL people are trash üòÖ, and that can‚Äôt be true right? how else would people fall in love, get married, have friends, etc. healthy relationships are built on the idea that people seek out and connect people who mutually benefit each other. Things I try to myself. 

I will say though - try not to isolate yourself from friends or people who say they care. I‚Äôve done this before and it only made things worse down the road. We all need support, and the more we isolate, the harder it is to pull ourselves up and recognize support when its available. 

Good luck; take care of yourself."
