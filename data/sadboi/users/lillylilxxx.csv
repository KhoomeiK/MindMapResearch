BPD,fpdnvwr,t1_fpdn37p,1588530704.0,Halsey's new album is really relatable if you want to give it a listen. I listen to it daily.

CPTSD,fpcg7v3,t3_gckt3l,1588499429.0,SAME!!!  Matilda was my absolute favorite movie and book. I have no idea how many times I have read and seen the movie as a child. Cinderella as well.

CPTSD,foylk03,t1_foyihfa,1588174687.0,"Thank you for your reply ‚ù§Ô∏è 

My situation is a little different because this person isn't abusive. They struggle a lot, just like I am, and I don't consider them bad or abusive. In fact I see them as one of the sweetest people I've ever met. But they tend to run away and throw me out of their life when things get rough. And I can't stand this. I have such a horrible fear of abandonment and every time something goes wrong between us, this person completely cuts me off...

I don't want us to completely lose contact, but I will stop desperately trying to chase them when they leave. It's now completely up to them."
CPTSD,foyhief,t1_foybaur,1588172621.0,You're very strong for doing this. My biggest worry is that soon I'll change my mind and I'll go back running to them and begging them go come back :(

Anxiety,fnoaspz,t3_g2jrq0,1587118603.0,"Yes. It's absolutely horrible. When it happens it feels like I'm on the verge of a panic attack, non stop for days. I think the longest had been around a week. It's impossible to sleep without lots of melatonin during those days, and I hope that if I wake up it will be gone but the anxiety just remains. I also do have some physical symptoms like my hands are shaky and I feel like I'm not breathing enough, my chest hurts and I might be dissociated.

I've noticed it happens mostly when I PMS when literally everything can throw me in anxiety mode."

Anxiety,fneohcl,t3_g1c1sh,1586893012.0,"Please please, if someone can test this and follow these steps it will mean the world to me.

1. send a picture to someone
2. turn off the wifi before it is sent (when the circle is not full)
3. delete the app
4. delete the pictures

Then please download the app and sign in. Is it still sent??

I completely understand if you are feeling lazy to do it, but please it will help me SO much."
BDSMAdvice,fn9lpof,t3_g02lfe,1586777671.0,"For me there's no submission without love. It is completely impossible for me to submit to someone fully and trust them (sometimes with my life!) without loving them with my whole heart. Of course each person is different and someone might not want to mix the two, but for me it just just not fulfilling enough when there is no love. Love isnt vanilla. Love can be anything you want it to be, it is all about how you show it."

CPTSD,fn83qyg,t1_fn82vks,1586733268.0,"That's what I thought! I was confused by the lack of information online. I was looking for information about possible therapies for the two when they coexist, because as I read both disorders require different approaches? So I was wondering if CBT or DBT is enough for treating both disorders simultaneously."

TalkTherapy,fmtue5s,t1_fmtu0py,1586379177.0,"I assume she thinks we will end up fighting and hurting more because it can be hard to control anger so lots of things we don't mean are being said.
