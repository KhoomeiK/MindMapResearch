entitledparents,fla21wr,t3_fmrm7i,1584974896.0,"This is how I got sick with pneumonia a few years ago. I worked in childcare and one mom was known for being not the greatest with following the rules. 

I was helping cover nap time for her room(toddler) and had to sit next to her coughing and wheezing child as she struggled to breathe and nap. Kid was fussing basically the entire time, cause you know, can't breathe properly and coughing so much.

(Kid had asthma and mom smoked heavily near the kid anyway. Kid always had some sort of cough, but this one was getting worse and worse.)

So anyway after almost two hours of no nap, this poor little girl is just miserable and absolutely done with everything and everyone. She's coughing, wheezing and clearly struggling to breathe while having basically as much tantrum as a sick toddler can have. 

We call Mom to come pick her up because kid is obviously sick. Mom finally comes after a few hours, (smelling like cigarettes) I mention to mom that her daughter had a really bad cough and she should probably see a doctor. 

Mom replied ""oh I took her yesterday, she has pneumonia and is on antibiotics for it"" before grabbing her daughter and leaving. Turns out mom had doped her daughter up with cough medicine before dropping her off earlier, to hide her being sick from us. 

Daughters full-time teachers and I just stood there stunned. I had just spent more than a few hours getting coughed and breathed on by someone who is confirmed pneumonia. We in turn had to disinfect everything and tell all the other parents that some fuckwit brought their very sick child to care and hid it from us. 

Guess who wasn't able to take time off a few weeks later, after they tested positive for pneumonia? ‡≤†_‡≤†"
