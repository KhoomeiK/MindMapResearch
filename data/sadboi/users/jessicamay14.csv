Anxiety,fq95gb8,t3_ghiqy2,1589186230.0,"All. The. Time. 

I feel like I‚Äôm constantly replaying every single interaction non stop and criticizing what I said or didn‚Äôt say and assuming all the horrible things and judgments others must be thinking. 

I try to shut it down whenever these thoughts start by telling myself nobody else is thinking about me or obsessing about what I said and to let it go. 

Have you ever looked up a list of cognitive distortions and tried challenging your thoughts when you start to analyze an interaction and going down the rabbit hole? It‚Äôs hard but sometimes doing a reality check that my thought is actually a worse case scenario or unrealistic black and white thinking, for example, and not necessarily true just because it popped into my head can be really helpful."

AskReddit,fi3jub4,t3_f63h0c,1582120958.0,"Not my home, but my parents‚Äô home. This happened about 10 years ago. 

My sister brought her new boyfriend home for the holidays to meet the fam. They were staying for a week or something. My parents welcome the guy and say all the clich√© ‚ÄòMake yourself at home‚Äô and help yourself to whatever-type stuff. Then at one point my parents and I go out for something and when we come back the boyfriend had found a Costco shrimp ring in the freezer, had taken it out to defrost, and was frying steaks on the stovetop that had been marinating in the fridge. Lol To be clear, this food he was preparing was all for himself. And as far as I remember, this happened mid day not even at a meal time. My parents were too stunned to say anything and I thought it was the funniest thing on earth. Then he goes and takes a Jacuzzi bath in my parents‚Äô en suite bathroom. I remember being downstairs in the living room and it was dead silence except for the sound of the Jacuzzi Jets coming from upstairs. Lol the guy did a few more little weird things, but I remember him being the most unpredictable and mannerless houseguest we have ever had.

Edit: should have added there were two other full bathrooms in the house, albeit without jacuzzis, in addition to my parents‚Äô en-suite bathroom."

FamilyLaw,fhkgkcf,t3_f3kkgh,1581682821.0,"I am a lawyer in New Brunswick and our provincial marital property act excludes business assets from marital property in certain circumstances. 

So without considering all the exceptions, general rule would be where a client would have money prior to entering a relationship which was then or thereafter used for business purposes and was not included or brought into family assets at any time during the marriage, it would likely be excluded from division of marital property.

All that being said, there are always exceptions which may allow a court to find such assets subject to division upon separation and there may be particularities to your province so it‚Äôs always best to consult a lawyer in your jurisdiction and set out all the facts for an opinion.

Edit: I should have added that BC likely has a similar or comparable provincial Marital Property Act which should be your starting point to figuring out marital property law in your province.

Edit 2: Sorry I felt my answer was lazy and I looked into it.  BC has the Family Law Act, SBC 2011, c 25, which will provide the framework for division of marital and non-marital property. Sections 81 to 97 relate to division of family property and section 85 defines 'excluded property' in relation to family property. Subsection 85(1)(a) excludes property acquired by one spouse prior to the relationship, i.e. your $100K, but you'll want to review the other sections and how they've been interpreted and applied in case law to see if anything could make that $100k subject to division.  Specifically s.96 provides when excluded property may be subject to division and s.96(b) allows the court to divide excluded property if it would be 'unfair' not to do so.  The particular facts of the relationship would have to be considered in their entirety to consider potential division and 'unfairness' under s.96(b), so again, lawyer in your jurisdiction could help on that point.  Cheers!"
relationship_advice,fh8hi7l,t3_f1o15j,1581359845.0,"Your friends are assholes and you did the smart thing. They‚Äôll get tired of the joke eventually.

I worked with a family court Judge who had so many unfortunate stories from people doing it without protection resulting in unplanned pregnancy. One that sticks out is the story of a guy who had a one night stand with a woman - didn‚Äôt even know her name - and she got pregnant with twins. She kept the twins and said Judge had to order child support payable to mom for both babies. Dude‚Äôs one night of irresponsible fun will end up costing him thousands and thousands of dollars over the next 18 years..unless the twins want to go to college, that‚Äôll be another 4 years of support and expenses.  And that‚Äôs on top of the mental and emotional toll I‚Äôm certain the whole situation had on all involved. 

Hang in there, something better to pester someone else with will come along soon enough."

pics,eokwayq,t1_eojhs53,1558662571.0,"I know, but look at it this way; this is their background, (just off Wikipedia) :

Hamilton has been married and divorced twice.[15] Her first marriage, from 1982 to 1989, was to Bruce Abbott, who left her when she was pregnant with their son Dalton.[16][17] In 1991, she moved in with film director James Cameron following his divorce from Kathryn Bigelow.[17] They had a daughter, Josephine, born on February 15, 1993.[16] She and Cameron married in 1997, but the marriage was short-lived, ending in a $50 million divorce settlement in 1999.[18]

So when she and Cameron hooked up, she would just have had her son and he likely took in the child as his own and for all intents and purposes they were a family.  They moved in together in 1991, and from this point forward would be considered a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù. Probably sharing household tasks or whatever rich and famous do. They had a second child, Cameron is making movies, they get married in 1997, the same year as titanic came out. So while Cameron has been making movies and building his career she‚Äôs been there along with him and the kids and holding down the fort. 

So after building this family lifestyle and having dependants together, the court would have a whole bunch of reasons to award that much."
