BipolarReddit,eys916r,t3_cyi3rn,1567390668.0,"I can totally relate to this. When I’m in a depressive state and find myself in social situations, I try my best to focus on the other person, since I usually feel like I don’t have anything of interest to say about myself (I mean, I do, but my brain tells me I don’t). I ask about what’s going on with them. If they’re planning on taking any holidays soon. I ask about the kids, the parents. Anything to keep the focus off of me."
