I clicked on this because it looked familiar and I hoped someone would mention it. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!"
Anxiety,ff8t3be,t3_es06b7,1579695054.0,"It is a brilliant feeling to have a massive clear out after a prolonged anxiety hibernation/hoard!
Really really well done, that shit is bloody hard to do. I took three bags of shite out of my flat today, walked down 14 flights of stairs and put it into the recycling bins outside. Not bad for an anxious agoraphobic - so I'm here celebrating the small victories, it's the only way. 
Good luck with the counselling, it can take time but it is so worth it. And good luck with the job interview, you're on a roll!"
unpopularopinion,f7ujg9b,t1_f7u6zb9,1574015290.0,"I am really impressed with the mental gymnastics on display with these guys. It is simple biology. If you have sex you risk pregnancy, every man and woman that has consensual sex is taking that risk. However the responsibility afterwards is heavily weighted down on the female side. Pregnancy decisions can not be an equal thing between a man and a woman as only the woman gestates.
This is just another 'women bad. Women want money. Money mine' bait post."
menwritingwomen,f608h4x,t1_f5zx0f8,1572609649.0,"Yup. I read one recently where the male was repeatedly putting his fingers ""in"" the ladies clit. Female name on the cover, but unless I got something proper messed up down there that doesn't seem likely to have been written by a woman."
CozyPlaces,f5a2ugl,t3_dnci0g,1572099486.0,Love this. It looks so peaceful and calm. The view is awesome and I can imagine sitting there with a book when the rain is lashing and the waves are pounding outside.
BPD,f22eyln,t1_f1z99rw,1569887706.0,Yeah that worries me too. It's a fine line to balance between not letting myself get fixated on other people and completely isolating myself socially. I know I should be making more effort to interact with the world and the people in my life - but it's so calm and quiet when I'm on my own. It seems the lesser evil.
BPD,f1z8pi9,t3_db1mqk,1569838538.0,"I have avoided attachments for nearly 10 years now. I get lonely of course but also my life is calmer than it's ever been. I don't discount the idea of a relationship in the future, in fact I have an idea of hanging out in my dotage with a fellow old fart on an allotment. 
I simply can't handle the emotions involved in trying to coexist with another person - it is too loud and overwhelming. I have a cat, he's cool, he'll do for now!"
mildlyinteresting,esrrqm3,t1_esra7uk,1562234572.0,"Jesus, are we all on Reddit at the same time? Who's running the city? The seagulls will take over if no one's watching them."
Anxiety,eoux388,t1_eouwis4,1558883204.0,"I keep telling myself ""it's Sunday, no bugger gets up on Sundays"" - I think this might be a bit of a reach though."
Anxiety,eouv9lq,t1_eouegal,1558881782.0,That was my thought too! It's 3:14 in the afternoon and I'm still in bed. Today has been a non starter. Try again tomorrow. .
