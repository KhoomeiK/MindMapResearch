When it comes to marijuana, you cannot give a proper dose recommendation without knowing the percentage of THC found within the plant, the active ingredient.

1) I cannot figure a consistently rational reason for God to put humans on Earth. 

2) In monotheistic faiths, God is a perfect being and reasonably so. We should always strive to be perfect (though, of course, it is impossible for humans) and *God-like* or *Christ-like.* The latter is understandable and more human, but the former.. God allows suffering to be had on Earth at the hands of men. I understand we have our agency and will be judged for those actions. However, if God is perfect and he allows men to go down paths of evil or destruction, should we not emulate that? Does being God like, then, mean to allow evil men to do evil things without opposition?

3) Why would God create such an insanely massive and virtually limitless universe, but only inhabit it with humans? If God has created life on other planets, why are they not referenced? If these forms of life do exist, will they appear in God's image (generally meaning humans) as well?
