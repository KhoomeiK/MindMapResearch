Genealogy,fqtljui,t1_fqt90kw,1589641353.0,"It's awful, isn't it? I remember how, in grad school, we were reading a seminal article on motherhood called 'Hate in the Countertransference' by Winnicott, who lists out like a dozen reasons why mothers might experience hate toward their children. The class was mostly women and there was a clear split between those who had children and those who didn't (with a few oddballs who fell into the opposite camp, obviously it wasn't a perfect split) - the moms totally got it, and the nonmoms were perplexed and uncomfortable with the idea that mothers might harbor any negative feelings toward their kids. Really speaks to your statement about the 96% who have been to the edge.

Another study we read, and I'm sorry but I don't remember the title or author, surveyed (I think American) mothers and discovered that, on average, the mothers considered abandoning a child (ie, leaving the family) to be an unforgivable act, far worse than harming a child physically. I imagine that bias informs whether or not moms are willing to seek treatment for infanticidal fantasies.

OP, mental illness is only partially heritable in most cases. I think in some families the secrecy is more dangerous than whatever generic vulnerability exists. It's important for us to know where we come from, to understand ourselves, and if those stories are shrouded in shame, we sometimes have to make our own peace with them."

Maine,fpi3scr,t1_fpi18ux,1588633095.0,"There's a lot of room between 'nothing' and 'removing children from the home' - I think it's perfectly reasonable to require vaccines for public school attendance. That would at least provide some protection for the immunocompromised. 

If I were in charge, I'd leverage our state's amazing child services infrastructure to provide a team of social workers and nurses who are trained to educate and assist parents with questions and concerns about vaccination schedules.  It's not a perfect solution, but families are all unique and I don't think there's a one-size-fits-all response that won't increase the ideological divide (science vs. fear mongering) or cause real harm to kids. I say real harm to distinguish the increased risk of contracting and spreading a preventable illness from the actual objective damage that family separation causes. 

I'm thinking about the horror stories in which parents had their kids taken away because they allowed a child to walk to the store alone, or left an 8 year old in the car while they ran into the gas station. [I'm referring specifically to cases in which the kids were fine but a well meaning stranger called the police.] Those are risky parenting decisions, but do they warrant criminal charges and family separation trauma? Should we be wasting valuable resources pursuing cases in which the risk never translated to harm? I'd say absolutely not, at least not without additional reasons to investigate.  

The difference between free-range parenting and anti-vaxxers is that the free range parents aren't putting other people at risk of contracting preventable illnesses. That's what makes this a public health issue and not a child services one."
Maine,fphfy2d,t1_fphe2vm,1588620590.0,I agree that they shouldn't have an option - I just disagree with the position that not vaccinating = abuse that should involve child protective services.
Maine,fpgygaj,t1_fpgrlkq,1588611747.0,"Being placed in foster care carries risks, too. I agree that not vaccinating your children is highly problematic, but this seems to imply that it's tantamount to neglect or abuse. 

Every decision we make as parents carries risk. Being a responsible parent means being informed about the risks and benefits, making a decision, and being prepared to defend it if shit hits the fan.

The problem with vaccines is that there is a ton of misinformation about the risks and rewards, and many people are a) paralyzed by fear of adverse reactions to vaccines, b) missing critical thinking skills, or c) both. In addition, shitty healthcare services mean that pediatricians do not have adequate time to educate, inform, and help parents navigate the decision-making process. As a result, many parents walk away feeling like their concerns were ignored, like they were talked down to or gaslighted.  They get ahold of the narrative that the government is taking away their rights as parents and their children's rights as medical patients. And frankly, they're right. Informed consent is a vital and wildly misunderstood/ignored aspect of healthcare, and it's not being adequately provided.  

Denying a child a vaccine is objectively dangerous. But that danger is qualitatively different from the kind of abuse or neglect that state welfare agencies are capable of investigating."

psychologystudents,fo40sfl,t3_g5ku6j,1587496237.0,"An individual's response to social distancing is going to depend on lots of factors.  I couldn't tell you how most people are reacting, but the general rule of thumb is that prolonged stress can throw a vulnerability into a full blown crisis. People who've never had an OCD symptom are unlikely to start having them now, but those with underlying vulnerabilities (high anxiety and rigidity, for example) may see their symptoms develop further.  

People who were already struggling with mental health issues are likely to be experiencing increased symptoms depending on their situation and access to resources.  Added financial stress and familial discord can throw gasoline on the fire, though more resilient folks may find that this experience gives us some perspective about what matters in the world. 

 You can't separate social distancing from the other effects of covid, if you ask me.  Social distancing has a very different impact on a 20yo extrovert bartender who just lost her job and now has no health insurance, compared to say, a 45yo single parent attorney who is having to lay off support staff while struggling to get his two kids through 12 different zoom appointments every day while worrying about his elderly parents.

The best place to start is by describing your career ambitions - do you want to prescribe medications? Conduct individual therapy? Group therapy? Institutional work, like inpatient facilities or corrections? Or maybe you prefer research and academics. Check out the licensing requirements in your state.

One thing I did while I was contemplating the career move was to book a career counseling session with a psychologist who served on my state's chapter of the American Psychological Association. That was incredibly helpful and informative, and I was able to sort my priorities out and get a realistic idea of the route to licensure. This isn't a decision that should be made lightly.

1. You are carrying weight because you are carrying trauma. Not all of that trauma is yours - much of it happened to your parents - but you're carrying it just the same.  It's not fair. 

2. It is possible to lose weight without first healing the trauma, but it will require massive resources of self-control, discipline, and effort. This is dangerous because your self esteem is already so fragile that it's nearly impossible to maintain a weight loss lifestyle without bullying yourself into more serious depression, or worse, developing an eating disorder (where obsessive weight loss takes the place of eating as a coping mechanism). Focusing on weight loss (as opposed to treating the trauma) is risky.

3. Good therapy is magic. Not all therapists or therapy techniques will work, though. Most people give up on therapy because it's too painful or because they don't have a strong relationship with the therapist.  Keep trying therapists until somebody clicks. Seriously. I didn't click with one until I was nearly 30. You'll know when you've found the right one. If I was starting again, I would begin with searching for Internal Family Systems therapists in my area, as this is the method of therapy I've found most helpful. PM me if you need help with this search.

4. Don't let your identity as a fat person be your only identity. Follow your passions, whatever they are. Develop the parts of yourself that you love the most, because those are the parts that will get you through the hard times. 

5. When you have the emotional resources (i.e.,  when you're feeling good), lean into the things that make you uncomfortable, sad, angry, or afraid. It's so tempting to avoid spoiling a good mood by dwelling on things that bother you, but this is exactly the best time to dwell because you're more capable of being kind to yourself. If you only do your introspection when you're already miserable, it'll be so much harder to see the good in yourself.

My understanding of Phineus is is that he was punished for the same reason as Prometheus - for sharing his god-given gift with humans. It wasn't about the prophecy per se, but about the breach of the god/human divide."

police,f917em1,t1_f916ngu,1574983683.0,"So a supervisor barged into a medical appointment which had already started and yelled at you to talk to her, and when you wouldn't she asked you to leave. And rather than talk to her (which I get, she yelled at you!) you'd like to talk to the police and....what? Get her fired or something? How does that help you?

If you want to know what's going on, and if you want to keep getting meds at this place, your only option is to talk to people who know what's going on."
police,f915oii,t1_f9152n0,1574982810.0,"New Hampshire, a state in the northeast US.

If you just don't want additional services, it doesn't make sense that they would threaten to call the police and eject you from your appointment. Was there yelling?

It's not fraud to sign off on a psych eval without the patient present, as long as the eval indicates that the patient was not present. We do it all the time, particularly for patients who are hospitalized or disengage from services."
police,f914vfr,t1_f913nm4,1574982404.0,"Of course you have the right to say no.  But you didn't ask to be discharged, so what exactly are you saying no to? Being called? It's not fraud to call you, even if you've asked them not to, and even if somebody signed off on it. 

I'm confused as to the reason they barged into an appointment, though. Did you understand their reasoning for this? What are they asking you to do?


I don't feel comfortable giving out more information than the state in which I worked, but I worked as a trauma therapist in a community mental health center in nh."
police,f911gm9,t3_e32kqv,1574980728.0,"Community mental health (former) staff here - in my state (nh) there are regulations about when we have to discharge clients (at their request is one of the conditions unless they have a guardian/can't make legal decisions on their own). Until a client his discharged, we have to contact them periodically to try to get them to re-engage.

I doubt they're breaking the law, but they may be falling to discharge you, which is ethically problematic. I'd suggest looking on the center's website and identifying the clinical director, then getting in contact with her/him directly.  Tell your story and listen to what they have to say. 

I'm willing to bet there's important information you're missing, like the clinic requires you to participate in multiple programs (meds management and therapy or case management, for example), but you only want to keep going for meds. They should be able to tell you why they keep calling, and you can ask what the process for transferring to another provider is if this place isn't a good fit for you.

I strongly suggest that you stay away from the police. They will not side with you unless you have been harmed, and you have not been harmed. You've been annoyed, and possibly underinformed about your treatment requirements."

BipolarReddit,f28i12x,t3_dce0pt,1570062115.0,"I can understand how you would be troubled by these memories. From just what you've said here, though, I don't think any of these behaviors constitutes CSA. I don't know what your relationship with your mom is like or what your history is, but there's no manual for how to raise kids. They develop a need for privacy gradually, so that one minute you're wiping their butt and the next minute they don't want you to see then naked. And that's not me waxing poetic - I mean literally that they switch back and forth constantly.

  So unless you have other reasons to suspect that your mother knowingly violated your boundaries, which you very well might have, my instinct is that your mom made mistakes in judging when you needed space and privacy from her.  She may have no idea it was bothering you. That doesn't mean that your feelings are wrong or invalid, just that they are part of a bigger context."
BipolarReddit,eyzhsq0,t3_czisy3,1567618035.0,"The difference between a toxic person and a healthy person isn't the severity of their mistakes, it's the sincerity of their regrets. 

I have anger. When I get angry, I say (and even do) terrible things. Even if my anger is a valid, rational response to something, nothing I say or do while I'm that angry is acceptable, because it's not what I'd do when I'm calm and capable of thinking clearly.

In other words, when I do something out of anger or any other strong emotion, including happiness/joy, there's a good chance that I'll regret it.  So it's my task/responsibility/goal to take really good care of myself, so that I get to be in charge of my behavior all the time.  

Toxic people are regular people who cause harm when they aren't in charge of their behavior, but they take no responsibility for it. Generally they either convert their regrets into guilt and shame, which fuels instability, or they externalize and blame others/circumstances then go on their merry ways.  I used to do this a lot more. I think we all do it to some extent. It's like the junk food of coping behavior - a little is manageable, even fun, but a lot is toxic.

I still feel regret for things I do when I'm not in charge, but I hold myself accountable for those actions by explaining why what I did was wrong, apologizing for exactly what I did, and asking if I missed anything. Then I recommit to being better, and I let people I care about see that process and support me.  


I hear you beating yourself up for mistakes. I just want you to know that while you're accountable for mistakes you make while you're upset (this also applies to mistakes made while not sober), you did not willingly choose to make them. You are not somebody who makes threats against others unless you are overwhelmed by powerful emotions, you're just somebody with regrets. So what are you going to learn from your mistake? What was your mistake in the first place? And once you apologize to yourself for making it, you can explore how to make amends to the people you've hurt.  That's the path forward, every single time.  

You're doing such a good job."
