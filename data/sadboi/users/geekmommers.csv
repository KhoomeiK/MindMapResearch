Why would the aliens show a mark of hades from a tv show?

Why would she know if she laid down that second aliens would beam her up?

Why does she see another roommate who says shes nikki?

Was the peach suit sequence a dream or abduction cause why would aliens have her walk through rooms with carpet on the walls and have sex with a tv show character?

Why is there a dream catcher on the horse?

Most likely something that happened to her in her childhood/bad childhood memories are causing her stress (even something as simple as watching parents fight).

The plumber is not a stranger hes in the start of the movie at 3:10 he walks past the store window, he parks his van outside the store, his store is right near the craft store.

Firstly Joan never sees Sarah walk the horse she just sees the horse. Sarah actually steals the horse twice. The first time she takes it to work and its walking around which explains why Joan sees the horse. It also explains the conversation with the therapist who said she was there weeks before in the mental institution talking about her horse. You got to remember the scenes are out of order I think everyone forgets this. It also explains why the stable managers dont trust her because they know she stole the horse and went into the mental institution they know shes unwell. The actors/directors have always said this movie is about lucid dreams/depression/schizophrenia there is no supernatural element its just what sarah wants to believe so she doesnt have to accept shes going crazy, thats why theres a mark of hades at the end to show its not really aliens beaming her up its her surrendering to going nuts, the mark of hades was from her tv show proving its her mind not aliens. She also got the theory of cloning from her tv show proving again its all in her mind. The director also put a flash of a shower curtain/running shower before every ‚Äúabduction‚Äù to show its just in sarahs mind just a lucid dream not an abduction. The shower curtain/running shower refers to the trauma of seeing her mum commit suicide. Also all this starts after she smokes weed, weed is known to set off schizophrenia. The supernatural element was meant to feel real to emphasise how real delusions are to mentally ill people but its never actually real shes just mentally ill. People forget too the director said the whole movie is subjective reality meaning every scene is not real every scene is how sarah sees everything, what sarah believes everything looks like so the photograph of her grandmother in reality probably looks nothing like her but in sarahs reality she believes it does. Also noone ever tells sarah her grandmother believed she was from the future her family just tell her she talked to the walls, sarah makes this up because she wants that to be the reality she doesnt wanna accept shes going crazy. The whole movie is how sarah sees things not whats actually real. Its all subjective reality."

The timeloop is made intentionally realistic to emphasise how real mental illness delusions are to people its meant to make you feel how sarah feels that you‚Äôre always questioning whats real.

movies,fh98zbr,t1_fh90a7y,1581375797.0,yeah I agree its just about mental illness the alien/timeloop has too many holes for that to make sense. Plus in every interview the director/actors say the movie is about schizophrenia/lucid dreams they never say its about aliens etc. I think the fact the time loop feels somewhat real is just about emphasizing that delusions are so real to someone mentally ill
horsegirlfilm,fh947uk,t1_fh8227j,1581373114.0,"I think its more that shes convinced herself hes a stranger when hes not, also her obsession with water"
movies,fh941q6,t1_fh82ve4,1581373034.0,"No it doesnt add up, because if she was her grandmother her mother would have never given birth to sarah but she did give birth to sarah because sarah is there when her mother dies she remembers it. Theres too many holes in the loop time
Theory"
horsegirlfilm,fh9302v,t1_fh83k1k,1581372537.0,Yeah could be I just couldnt see them
movies,fh92yhy,t1_fh8vup2,1581372516.0,The mark of hades was shown on the dead body in her show purgatory to me it suggests she killed herself
horsegirlfilm,fh92sa5,t1_fh9135b,1581372435.0,Yeah I agree with what your saying about she didnt know what was real or not so neither do we
movies,fh7jieh,t1_fh7jfmj,1581334833.0,"I dont know how to explain it thats the only thing that puzzles me but when the director was asked about that scene he said he will ‚Äúleave it up to interpretation whether you think its objective reality or subjective reality that joan is seeing the horse, of course though the whole movie is subjective reality‚Äù. Soo... i tend to think maybe that scene was just thrown in to throw people off or it didnt really happen in the way its shown"
movies,fh7j4o2,t1_fh7ixvf,1581334348.0,Yeah I a hundred percent agree with your comment everything can be explained but that. And to me its not possible shes the grandmother because she remembers her own childhood not the grandmothers childhood. If she was her grandmother then she technically doesnt exist and wouldnt even have that childhood to remember
movies,fh7ivgi,t1_fh7ipn7,1581334015.0,Thats true. I kinda hope the director clears up the ending for people. I like wondering but at the end of the day Id rather know which ending they had in mind. I read the director said he made each ending plausible on purpose but that he left enough clues to make which ending they really went with obvious. There‚Äôs definitely clues throughout the movie but the ending is definitely not obvious
movies,fh7iqji,t1_fh7inyr,1581333836.0,"True true. I still tend to think she was just mentally ill and killed herself, the abductions/time loop doesnt make sense to me but this movie could be interpreted so many ways I could be totally wrong. Kinda the genuis of the movie is that each different ending kinda makes sense"
movies,fh7imck,t1_fh6c4sz,1581333679.0,The bruising can also just be explained by mental illness considering she doesnt remember what shes been doing
movies,fh7ikrn,t1_fh77grc,1581333620.0,"And if the aliens were abducting her why would there be a mark of hades, that was from her tv show"
movies,fh7ij09,t1_fh7hctx,1581333554.0,And if the aliens were abducting her at the end why would there be a mark of hades. The mark of hades is from her tv show
movies,fh7helv,t1_fh7hctx,1581331984.0,Maybe but she does remember being there for her mothers death and she does remember riding her horse as a teenager with her friend heather and heather falling off so there is scenes that show she remembers her own childhood
horsegirlfilm,fh7hb0n,t3_f171pq,1581331837.0,yeah I was waiting for that scene too! disappointed it didnt happen

Was the ending? (comment which ending you think)

- All in Sarah's head, just schizophrenia/depression
- She was being abducted by aliens
- She was being abducted & time loop

Interested to see what gets the most votes"
horsegirlfilm,fh7euyo,t1_fh2127h,1581328194.0,I dont think theres a time loop because you cant have the time loop without the aliens and I dont think shes ever abducted I think thats just her mental illness
horsegirlfilm,fh7er5i,t1_fh1z5xv,1581328031.0,"the plumber she sees all the time, he's in the movie immediately at 3:10 he walks past the window while sarah is talking to the young girl who works at the store, his store is next to the craft store, he parks in the parking lot, she sees him in the background all the time but believes her own delusions that shes never seen him. 

the girl with the dark hair is sarah its her younger self, shes in the family photos standing next to the mum, she's also the alternative roommate and when they show sarah younger riding a horse its the same girl. they have the same dream with the ramp because they are both sarah"
