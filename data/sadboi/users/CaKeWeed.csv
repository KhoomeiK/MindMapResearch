2. Drawing on yourself is much better than hurting yourself as you know. He thinks its immature but its you trying to get better. Thats a valuable thing. you are trying to imptove yourself and your life and that is the most important thing.

3. Cutting is obviously because its hard to deal with things and it becomes an addiction like a drug.

4. Maybe im weird but i view self harm scars as battle scars. As proof that you dealt with something tough but you survived it. Imo its no less than a scar from, idk, fighting a wild animal with your hands.
