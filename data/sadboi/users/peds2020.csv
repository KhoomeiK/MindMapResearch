BipolarReddit,fkyui4x,t1_fkxl7qk,1584656420.0,"I read about him too :) and I’m sure there are others like him out there who perhaps haven’t shared their story. Not gonna lie third year was hard and I was still really depressed but I found a great therapist and started coping better over time. I’m in a great headspace now and so excited to start residency!

You’ll be absolutely amazing! Going thru hardship hasn’t been easy but I’ve grown a lot honestly. And I have more empathy for sure."
