relationship_advice,figuvhe,t1_figm1jd,1582403697.0,Im not sure. I should probably think about that.
relationship_advice,figknki,t1_figk1bi,1582400709.0,"Uhm. Not necessarily. My boyfriend literally told me ‚ÄúI dont think I wanna get back together‚Äù and still came and met with me because we enjoy eachothers company as friends too. BUT its much easier to say ‚Äúwere not getting back together‚Äù when you havent seen the person. Also I dont think getting a card or writing a letter is dorky but if its not the way you express love than you can do it your own way! Also if she doesn‚Äôt really want to get back together forcing her won‚Äôt help because it‚Äôd be a bad relationship. And taking her to a concert is a great way to show it! Maybe get her some merch from the concert and incorporate something heartfelt with it. Another thing that helped me was, I knew I was getting the gifts because I love him. Not just because I wanted to get back together"
relationship_advice,figiylf,t3_f7x89n,1582399999.0,"Me and my boyfriend went through a break up before. We haven‚Äôt been dating as long as you and your s/o but, me and him were apart for two weeks. It showed me how much I love and miss him. We met up after the two weeks and I wrote him a 3 page letter and got him some small meaningful gifts and we talked about why we broke up, how we can fix it and it just worked. Were really great now. I just made sure to not get my hopes really up. Its important to prepare yourself for it to go either way. She might feel like she needs longer. The thing that I thinks the most important though is to change the way the relationship was. If it stays the same after the break, it‚Äôll happen again."
relationship_advice,fighb0u,t1_figgtla,1582399454.0,My rolls do need to slow. And I know he‚Äôs already mine. Definitely not trying to be possessive.

stevenuniverse,fibia8e,t1_fibi77q,1582322532.0,Yepper depper. Nice to hear your opinions. Very eye opening
stevenuniverse,fibh8fy,t1_fibgbsx,1582321892.0,"I think Rose was selfish. She needed to choose who she was not lead this double standard. She should‚Äôve led her rebellion as pink diamond or as rose and rose alone. She hurt so many gems. There is no way she couldn‚Äôt have seen this would lead to a war. If the gems wouldnt let up if ANOTHER DIAMOND told them to, how did she think that they‚Äôd let it go if a bunch of gems rebelled? The diamonds were obviously ready to fight for that planet. Rose acted like she was this saint and LIED to all her friends, her husband, and her family. Yes Earth would‚Äôve lost lives if she didn‚Äôt fight but look at all the other gems who went basically INSANE over her actions. She didn‚Äôt really risk her life even on the battlefield, she couldn‚Äôt be shattered unless it was for Bismuth. Who disappeared without ever telling anyone because thats how important her secret was to her. She could deflect anything with her shield. She never had to worry about losing her life but she was so damn quick to put everyone elses on the line for a half way fake cause. And like I said everything is open to interpretation with the show. I think it is braggy to say you find it obvious this is how it is, when neither of us are right. The only person who really knows is Rebecca Sugar."
stevenuniverse,fibfbxe,t1_fibed2i,1582320761.0,"I think it was definitely more about pink getting shattered. Pink would be the first one Bismuth would go for because Earth was Pink‚Äôs colony and thats who they needed to get rid of first before any other diamond. How could pink care about her family that much if she started a rebellion against homeworld itself where all of her ‚Äúfamily‚Äù lived. She launched a war where countless gems from her home were destroyed, she knew the diamonds would be a part of the war regardless and if she cared about them THAT much, she wouldn‚Äôt cause them all of that mental and emotional trauma including putting them and their comrades at that risk. I think pink considered amethyst, garnet, pearl, and greg her family. She even went to where blue Diamond and her council were and started attacking. Who knew if troops were following behind her? BUT, the thing thats beautiful about the show is all of that is open to interpretation. Who each individual person thinks of rose and what her intentions were its really up to the viewer."
