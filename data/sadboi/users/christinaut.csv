bipolar,fj9mgbt,t1_fj9m7rq,1583153640.0,"No worries! It really differs from medication to medication, like the 1st month I was sleepy and was ultra rapid cycling till I finally got stabilised, it was a hard time but it was worth it.  My suggestion would be just go see a psychiatrist and then go from there, I know researching seems reasonable but only a real dr can help you and give you true guidance. Not that all Drs are fucking Saints but I am sure ull find the right one for you!"
bipolar,fj9lwbh,t1_fj9ljfm,1583153144.0,"Getting a diagnosis if you really are bipolar of any kind is one of the best things that can happen because you finally get what you need in order to be better, dont be scarred honestly it gets better once you know what u have and have specialists on your side.

I am currently only on Depakote which is a stabilizer and I should start talking some small dose of antidepressants with that too soon. Have been on it for a year, it hasnt been always easy I gained 20kgs and got hypothyroidism BUT it definitelly made me not have the hypomanic and manic episodes I used to get quite often and that is what I needed. Side effects are a bitch but being stabilized is worth it and every story is truly unique and different."
bipolar,fj9lbpl,t3_fcb1i4,1583152623.0,"Yeah, I am rapid cycling too, took me a while to get a psychiatrist to actually know that rapid cycling exists but it does! I cycle sometimes multiple times a day and other times weekly/biweekly. Get diagnosed ofcourse and I hope it all goes well!"

bipolar_irl,f3epxkk,t1_f3dbgrl,1570883757.0,Exactly how I would describe my stability too tbh. I just go from hypomania straight to mildly depressed/the kind of depression I can still be productive at so thats the best kind of stability scenario I can get without constantly changing meds and having to deal with the side effects
bipolar_irl,f27i1ab,t3_dc5ixw,1570038686.0,Hahaha literally said that today!
bipolar,f049vlk,t3_d3oldx,1568382951.0,173cm went from 75kgs to 94kg. I got thyroid problems because of Depakote but now that my thyroid is stable I am trying Dukan for the 2nd time in my life and its working! First time arround I lost 11kgs and kept the loss for 2 years...have to say though Dukan is not for everyone but I would suggest you take a look at it

I gained 12kgs in 2months,any diet I did before medication that worked wont work now it just keeps my weight stable and from not gaining more.

I have another view on romantic relationships though, I definitely do want them in my life. Now, since I dont wanna have close friends I have just found this bar that the same people always go to and I always have this great talks with them, the vibes are always perfect so when I am lonely and just wanna have a beer and talk with someone I know I just hop over there. Everyone has different needs and a different view on things. I hope you will either get some friends or just learn to love yourself and this loneliness will go away as clichÃ© as that sounds."

Uni exams havent exactly gone as I expected but hoping for the best, I have 1 exam left, send me good vibes!

Tinder may have done its magic, been talking with this amazing seeming guy, not gonna lie I have already thought of baby names :P hopefully we will go in a date this week finallyy

Goals include studying as much as possible for the exam, waist train every day of the week and work at least 3 days this week. Should start gym ASAP too but hopefully Ill be able to in 15days.

Anyway, hope everyone will have an amazing week!"
