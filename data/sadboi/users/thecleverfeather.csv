Oil goes last after a water based product. Products I recommend are neutrogena hydro boost gel cream or cerave moisturizing cream. Cerave also makes a great hydrating cleanser that I use.

There are a ton of people who live with families or who have spouses who can AFFORD to take care of them while they get their shit together. Some people don‚Äôt have that luxury.  Think about all the spouses who don‚Äôt leave each other because of financial reasons or marry people immediately after a divorce or deceased spouse. Some people have families who abandon them. Some have no friends. Some people have spouses who die and leave medical bills they can‚Äôt pay that ruin their credit so they can‚Äôt rent. Some people run away from families who abuse them. Some people are so mentally ill they hate anyone who tries to help them. Some people are addicts. Some people can‚Äôt live off their disability check. Some people are in huge debt going to college and can‚Äôt afford housing. Employers often fire employees when they find out they are homeless. I‚Äôm sure there are more examples.

You can get an EKG to make sure your heart is of good health before you do it but prescribers are just going to ask you if the benefits outway the negatives and it will be your choice in the end.

Without that motivation it‚Äôs very hard to participate in life. You will feel a lot of ups and downs but keep pushing you can get out to the other side.
