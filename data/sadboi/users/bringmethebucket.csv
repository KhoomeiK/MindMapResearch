snakes,fqmkoae,t1_fqlixgi,1589479028.0,"There's a big difference in hunting style between the two, which can explain the ouch-difference.

 Boas grab their prey with their mouth, then immediately wrap their bodies around it and squeeze it to death. So, their teeth can be small because they only need enough for the initial grab. 

Corn snakes don't constrict their prey, so they need big enough teeth to really grab hold and lock down a struggling animal, and eat it alive. Hence, longer teeth. 

I had four little rows of punctures on my finger after I got bit. They don't have any big fangs up front, just rows of little needles down the sides. For grabbin' and holding on tight."

awakened,fqcy58d,t1_fqcskh1,1589272968.0,"I recommend practicing gratitude. At least once/day, just think of something you're grateful for on purpose, and take a deep breath while appreciating whatever it is. Do this whenever something goes well, when you're having a nice time, when the weather is pleasant, when you notice a pretty flower. Practice feeling into Gratitude in those moments. 

When you start getting good at that, it will become easier to handle negative situations because you're already in a posture of seeing and appreciating the bright side. Failures can become lessons taken with grace. 

Also, don't worry about what ""level"" you're on. Just be you :)"

As a teenager I came to be a narcissist's plaything and experienced trauma there. But, overall I had a wonderful childhood. 

It took me months of therapy before I could admit I was abused as a teenager. I took all the blame for every bad thing about my life and became depressed, felt worthless. And at the same time, I felt ashamed because I felt like I had no excuse to be depressed, like I had it so good and squandered my potential. 

In the last 3-4 years, I've really been working on myself and unpacking my shit. The codependency 'lens' has helped the process so much. I've started looking at my upbringing through the lens of codependency and realized that my parents were codependent too. They were never abusive, but they sure did model some behaviors that, while seemingly harmless at the time, set me up to be badly prepared to set boundaries. 

Your story doesn't have to compete with the horror stories of those who were raised in a narcissistic hellhole to be valid. Your experience moulded you into the person you are, and you've got the cards you were dealt. 

You are worthy of self-respect, and every little thing you do to address your issues and care for yourself will bring you closer to healing.

Deep breaths. Baby steps. <3"
