I didn't show anything else because I was self conscious. It worked for us. You could think about trying something similar where you show your face or a body part you're proud of and have him either admire it or jerk off to it. You could also ask him if he wants to hear sexual fantasies of yours that you can send him to read and get off to. There are lots of different ways to get frisky and have sex or be intimate in a long distance relationship. Something I did with my current boyfriend who was long distance as well was mutually masturbate over the phone. You can either project bodily noises or moans or both as well as talking dirty when you build up the nerve to say things. Even if none of these work, you can think of something that could turn both of you on, even if it seems weird at first. Good luck!

DON'T do anything you're uncomfortable with, just find something that allows you to present what you are ok with presenting, there are plenty of ways to do this besides sending nudes.

You could also ask him if he has any fetishes like feet or objects so that you can interact with him in that way without showing much of yourself and still getting to have sex with him."

He also fears that I'm kicking him out, but I already addressed that with him and told him that going to his car is just so he can scream in the street instead of our apartment.
