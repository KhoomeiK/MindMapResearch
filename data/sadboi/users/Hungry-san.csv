I figured ya'know what fuck it and paid the 7 dollar delivery fee again to have my bonus burritos, my burritos show up and what do you know they forgot the extra. At this point we had paid over 20 dollars in delivery fees because my brother ordered his separately and so his also had a delivery fee.
