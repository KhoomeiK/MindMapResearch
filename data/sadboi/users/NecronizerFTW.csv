But I have like a daily 4-5 hours total commute to and from college which is enough time for me to work on something like learning something new or just working on a project. Here some tips I can give you:

1. You need to find time to do projects. You can do it when you have a lunch break or even during holidays too. I'd say holidays are the best time where you can devote some time to projects. It'll keep you productive as well. But just don't devote all your time to projects and do spend quality time with your family too. 

2. I started out by just watching some tutorial series off YouTube to learn so enough so I can start on a personal project and I just figure out everything else by myself through stack overflow or any other thing. You could also tweak that YouTube tutorial code to make it yours too. 

3. I have even joined a college committee where we actually spend the winter session in doing projects and right now I'm currently doing 2 projects in the said committee. So that's another option you can look into if you want to force yourself to do projects. 

4. One new thing I started is just starting out with one piece of technology and build something up without looking at tutorials but just referring docs. Documentations are the best source of tutorials because they're always updated as and when there's any changes. 

5. You could even tweak the code you do in class to make it seem like a mini project too. I recently had the Java class last semester and I remember that we had to make a calculator in Java Swing. So what I did was rather than writing all the code in the same file like how everyone else did, I made it like a mini project where I built it up using MVC architecture. That impressed my prof too and hey I did small project in Java too! Win win situation!


Hope you find any of those tips helpful. All the best dude!"

Deathcore,f9cvutb,t3_e4gt3p,1575227792.0,"1. I was a self taught dude. But sometimes the tutorials from Dines and Austin Dickey helped too. 

2. Took me about 7-8 months to start sounding like a proper deathcore growl rather than sounding like heavier metalcore mids. I used to practice a lot of metalcore back when I first started but then I started imitating the mighty PhillyBo from Whitechapel and then it started to get better and better.

3. 1-2 hours. I just pretended that my small ass room was a concert hall and I have loud speakers so I closed up everything and kept my AC on for air circulation and then I just performed like I performed live

4. This carried out for 5 days a week for atleast 3 years. 

5. I think most of the tips given out by another commenter is pretty much sufficient. But I can add some more too: 

 - Never directly start with deep growls at the start itself. Do some warm ups and then some metalcore type mids and then transition to deep ones. I like to call this the Bodysnatcher method lol. 

 - When you feel you have gone deep enough, use your tongue to make it sound much better. When I got lower and lower, my growls weren't that impressive but when I started playing around with my tongue positions (now that I start thinking about it, it sounds so wrong lol) it has become considerably better. 

 - Water keeps your throat hydrated and makes everything sound filthy. But do remember the actual effort has to be from the abdomen and not your throat. 

 - Lastly pick an idle that you want to sound like and just practice their songs. For me it was PhillyBo and that helped a lot.

 - Also no cupping is useful for better pronunciation too. That's the thing I love about PhillyBo"
