Eh, fair. But, the things I listed would have prevented suffering from things like starvaiton and disease in addition to preventing deaths.

>If we all evolved from apes then where do the apes come from?

Apes and humans share a common ancestor that lived millions of years ago. Distinct groups within the population of this common ancestor experienced different evolutionary pressures and mutations which led to their divergence into distinct species lines, which eventually gave rise to extant humans and ape species.

>Where does this Earth come from?

The Earth formed from the accumlation of material in the protoplanetary disk of the early solar system.

>What caused the Big Bang to happen?

Likely unknowable, since the concept of ""cause"" and ""effect"" don't make sense before the big bang.

>What is our purpose in life?

We don't have any.

>Scientists will never be able to answer these questions unless they admit that these is a supernatural being (who we refer to as Allah) that created everything.

This is actually the true victory of science over religion. Believing in fairy tales is the easy way out. It takes actual maturity to accept that there are things we can't answer right now and be okay with that. Perhaps one day we'll be able to answer those questions, or ask the right questions.

>We have logical explanations for all these questions that science can't answer.

No, you have a fairy tale.

>You can't and will never prove that religion is bullshit.

I don't particularly care to ""prove"" anything. It was you who made the connection between the fundamental way religions work and psychological blackmail. Most reasonable people see a problem with this once they realize it - psychological blackmail is not something a legitimate idealogy needs to continue exist. Instead, you decided that you were okay with this, which tells me everything I need to know about you."
