It’s not for everyone. I actuallllllyyy never used any of the books. I bought them but I couldn’t bring myself to open them because I feel very overwhelmed approaching my hurt by myself. I can’t speak to the effectiveness of either because all I have done is navigate therapy with a trauma-specialized guide and she has not disclosed what approach she has taken with me

CPTSD,fr045py,t1_fr020p4,1589783201.0,"I see what you are saying. The “friend” is actually a sorority sister who I’ve hung out with a few times, so I do have to be around her amicably. You are probably right that I shouldn’t call her a friend, it’s just, I don’t have many, and she showed interest in me, I felt like I should be more open minded instead of deny a connection with her. I thought, I’ll be responsible for my own feelings, my own hurt- instead of letting her become to me like the dominant oppressive force I was raised under. In truth, I am very drawn to those with personality disorders, probably because I was raised very forcefully by one. It’s not on purpose, it’s a self destructive tendency I commonly find myself repeating. I try very hard to avoid it, but it’s like, the harder I try, the deeper I find myself in those relationships. But anyhow, I don’t believe in “good” and “evil”-mainly because I perceive those qualifiers as religious and I’m not religious. But also because it is easier for me to make sense of my complex trauma if I don’t believe in them. As I’ve grown I’ve come to see my mother and some of the other sick people who have hurt me as small, insecure, and unfortunate because they will never experience true life, true love. Even if they could, they could not truly experience happiness in their lifetime because if they truly had empathy, they would never, ever be able to rid themselves of the insurmountable debt of guilt they are responsible for. I sort of find it easier to rationalize that “hurt people hurt people” and that aggression and destruction doesn’t come from nowhere. I believe everything has a causation, just like my hurt, just as my lifelong scars do. Some people are damned to horrible, unforgivable traits that honestly shouldn’t be allowed in this world. Traits I wish were eradicated off the face of this earth. But it doesn’t come from nowhere, it comes from somewhere. That’s the only thing that I can hold onto that makes me able to be okay with their behavior, and therefore my hurt. Maybe it is unhealthy. But that’s my coping strategy- to kill everything with an oversized order of empathy. Although, I do tend to give it away like candy and that’s probably why I’m so attractive to sick people. So maybe take this with many grains of salt."

They are all from the same line as the book I listed and are centered around a DBT approach.

One of them slapped me to wake me up because she “had to take a shit and aint allowed to leave me by myself” and no one believed anything you said. The patients who had been there before I arrived told me to never let any nurses see me cry or they’ll “hit you with the three” Aka 3 injections to sedate you and put you in a “secure” cell.
