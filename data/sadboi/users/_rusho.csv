depression,fqor60o,t3_gk3d5w,1589522457.0,Don't try. I didn't cut my hand for almost 2 years and then I relapsed last month. I honestly regret it. Maybe try something that you didn't do for a long time? Maybe calling an old friend or something. Idk what will work for you and I am not in position to talk. But I can relate a bit. Hold on to yourself as long as you can please.
depression,fqoqhj6,t3_gk0ga1,1589521909.0,"It's like I am drowning and I am trying to swim except I don't know how to swim. It feels like that for hours and then suddenly I feel like giving up ""everything"". I kind of feel like I am continuously drowning knowing it will never end. I am suffocating. I can't see, can't move the direction I want to move. I can't cry because it's all the same. Blurry, pointless. I feel so tired. Too much tired.
Does that make any sense? Sorry.
It's uncomfortable yet a regular routine."

I don't know how I got into the best university of my country. I was so depressed(still am), was in a toxic relationship, my parents were considering divorce. It was all messed up. Someday I studied a lot, someday the thought of study made me wanna puke. In the end, it's all pointless, right? 
I am in 3rd semester now and so far with pretty great CGPA even though my attendance is horrible. 
Before every single class, I feel like hiding or committing   suicide bt somehow, so far..I am mostly okay. 
Maybe the choice of ""just doing it without thinking"" is not that bad."

depression,fot8uxz,t3_g92rsa,1588047359.0,"Doesn‚Äôt really matter. What if everyone loves you? No one can or will be there for you forever. We don't like to admit but we are quite more alone than we think we are. Most of the time of our life, we live with ourselves. As long as you accept the person you are and love yourself, it won't really matter if anyone else love you or not. It's good if they do. We all like to be appreciated and loved. But there's nothing wrong if theres no one. Isn't that sad? Relatively. 
In the end, its about perspective."

depression,focvk1t,t3_exo6f1,1587676452.0,"For couple of hours after seeing my ex's pic through my friend, I tried not to cry. It's not that I am upset because she didn't try to work on a three year long relationship, it's just hurts to see the person who ruined these years doing completely fine. She used to mock my depression and throughout all these years, I had to hide that side of me infront of her because she didn't like that. 
After trying to play online games, I threw my phone away and kept weeping. I can't stop. I want to hurt myself. It has been almost two years since I last cut my hands and all. I want to do it so badly. I want to smoke a cigarrete and give burn in my body. I really want to hurt myself. I know I will be fine after couple of hours or so. But I also know this feeling would comeback. Life is unfair. I want to shout like a mad person. Everyday is a struggle."
