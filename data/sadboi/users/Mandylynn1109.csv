Don't give in because you feel like you have no other option & I know that's easier said than done. I completely understand about having nowhere to go as well... Not everyone has a big network of family & friends who you're close enuf with to say ""hey mind if I move in for a bit""... I wish you luck love. I hope he gets it through his head...

I feel like if you guys are in a committed, serious/semi~serious relationship, he shouldn't have the nudes on his phone. If he wants to email them to himself to have just in case you guys don't end up together forever, that would be fine I'd think... & him looking at nude girls in general doesn't seem to bother you, I feel like it's just the fact that's it's his ex & that I completely get. Especially since he's separated himself from this ex completely in every other aspect ya know. It's definitely uncomfortable to think of the person you're currently with, maybe looking at the person he used to be with during his ""alone time"".

That being said, whether she's cheating or not, regardless, she should be trying to come to you and talk to you about this.

As a woman, I understand the initial shock, anger & hurt she'd have, however like you were saying, think rationally. I think trying what you've suggested is the better option... It could lead to a strengthening of their relationship & if it turns out that he continues to behave the way he's been behaving after OP opens that line of communication & whatnot, at least they know they tried & didn't just give up on something that may have been the real deal... I don't know, that's just my opinion, but I definitely agree with what you're saying."
relationship_advice,fnzhg7b,t1_fnzeun7,1587394146.0,"I agree completely...

I feel you on this... I have a compromised immune system & my husband still has to work every day, unfortunately we don't have the option of two separate homes & it's definitely been a struggle with the current situation. Explain to her that even if she were there with you, you wouldn't be able to be around her & that wouldn't she rather have you here when this is over, than take that chance that you may not be? This stuff is no joke... I'm sure you've probably already said these things to her, but if it helps you definitely are right for what you're asking... It's a scary time.

relationship_advice,fm8bjsk,t3_ftpdhr,1585846378.0,"Not being unreasonable IMO... Maybe being in quarantine with her alone will bring roommate B to her breaking point with her also... I know you're trying to resolve everything so the 3 of you can live together & everything works for every one, but sometimes it's not possible especially when someone has such disregard for the boundaries and rules set for the entire household (not just against her). I don't know if you & roommate B can afford to live just the 2 of you or perhaps find someone else but living with that much anxiety & frustration isn't healthy love. Sometimes being roommates completely ruins the friendship & unfortunately with someone who thinks ""this is my house too, I pay rent and I'm an adult, I can do what I want"", she needs to have her own place or live w/ ppl who just don't care... people who aren't ready to be adults & respectful I guess...
