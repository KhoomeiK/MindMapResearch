Particularly because I rarely (if ever) discuss my business with anyone (as is necessary often times). Because politics can be so polarizing I get a lot of nonsense conspiracy theories and just plain biased misinformation thrown at me in regular conversation. I have trained myself fairly well to just ignore and not engage with any feelings beyond the occasional correction of misinformation.  

When I was younger and new in my position I would passionately fly into an extended Ted Talk when someone would start to try to ""school"" me.

I told her exactly the truth and she said that my car was no longer mine, I couldn't be trusted at all and was a lying piece of shit. If I wanted to continue living there to call her to pick me up from work. I never called.
