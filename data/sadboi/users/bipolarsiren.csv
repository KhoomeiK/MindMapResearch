careeradvice,fkyt5bu,t3_flbjjc,1584655613.0,"I think if it’s something you’re really interested in on your own and you’re hesitant about it, you should take the time to explore it a little before jumping in full force. Start with a class or two and then go from there! You always have time to change majors!"
mentalillness,fkxvvie,t3_fl9oew,1584636433.0,"Another bipolar person here, it’s definitely offensive to some of us. Context and who is sending it is important, but I also know that my friends would NEVER send me something like this because of how hard and frequently I struggle."
careeradvice,fkxuy13,t3_flbjjc,1584635929.0,"You’re in 12th grade, it’s completely fine to have no clue what you wanna do. I’m almost 23, have dropped out of college multiple times and pursued many things. I didn’t know what I wanted to do until I was 21, which ended up being psychology. But ya know what my dad wants me to do? IT, computers, etc. He doesn’t support my dreams of being a psychologist/psychiatrist. But after years of agonizing over what I wanted to do with my life, working dead end jobs that pay very little, I found that my career choice was actually something I had always had an interest in, even though it would come and go as it pleased. The answer may be right in front of you, you just haven’t gone through the steps that allow you to see it yet. If you’re going for a 4 year degree, I’d say take your Gen Ed’s first, while some find them boring and pointless, gen Ed’s were the thing that helped me find my confidence in a classroom and actually pointed me in the right direction for my career. I would also say take classes from both, get a feel for both majors, and let tht help you decide. If you’re torn between the two, those experiences could be your tie breaker. And also keep in mind how long you’ve had an interest in coding/computer engineering, if it was before your parents started mentioning the doctor thing, then I guess it’s safe to assume you do indeed have that interest and should follow that career path for you! Parents aren’t always right, I’ve definitely found that out over the past couple years. They can project their dreams and shortcomings onto their children which isn’t healthy. I’d say do what YOU want. Your parents don’t have to live the rest of your life, YOU do!"

AskWomen,f1x7ago,t3_daufe5,1569794696.0,"Skateboarding, cars, boxing/martial arts, weightlifting, honestly too many things to count. I started band in 6th grade and got sucked into it and cared about nothing else for 10 years. Now i'm 22, selling all my instruments, and feel like a ghost of a person because i have no real interests or hobbies other than gaming. Social anxiety and depression make it really hard for me to get out there and learn new things, wish i had tried earlier when they werent as much of an issue."

Spectrum,etcdema,t3_ayzakj,1562682115.0,"I've been having the same issue with Spectrum. We've had our line ""fixed"", modem replaced, and about 5-6 techs out to ""fix"" it. Nothing has worked and they keep telling us nothing is wrong, but our internet drops about 15-20 times daily. I've pretty much had it with Spectrum at this point, this has been going on for over a year with no end in sight."
