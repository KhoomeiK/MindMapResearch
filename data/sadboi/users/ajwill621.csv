Anxiety,fk41bgb,t3_fge0bt,1583851192.0,I totally understand this. When I have something going on later in the day that I’m anxious about it can sometimes ruin my whole mood/day and I just feel stuck. I’ve been trying to narrate what I’m doing in the moment whether it’s out loud or in my head. Ex) I’m getting out of bed. Im brushing my teeth. Focus on what you’re doing right then to try and bring your mind back to the present.
Anxiety,fk40ke4,t3_fgbm99,1583850720.0,I’m sorry you’re feeling this way. It took me a long time to open up about how I was feeling to family and friends and finally found a therapist that I felt comfortable and it has helped a lot.
Anxiety,fk401xs,t1_fk3zorp,1583850392.0,I went in and word vomited about how anxious I was about being there and “confessed” about my poor habits and that I knew I had multiple cavities. It turned out I did have one cavity but it was nowhere near as bad as I had imagined and I made it through! You’ll do great 😊
Anxiety,fk3ztf1,t3_fgctw6,1583850242.0,I finally made it to the dentist too recently! Proud of you!
Anxiety,fk308sz,t3_faz1uo,1583813697.0,"Oh my gosh, I can relate so much!!! I’ve been working really hard on my anxiety related to procrastinating. I will constantly push things off that I need to do like make a phone call about something because I’m anxious about how the call will go and what they are going to say and how I’m going to respond. Within the last few months I have accomplished many things I’ve been pushing off like calling the dentist and getting an eye appointment. When I finally did them I was so proud of myself! I keep trying to remember this when something else comes up, it feels like it’s impossible but will only make it worse if I push it off. Be proud that you finally did it and put a check in the success column!!"

SubstituteTeach,fk2xfoi,t3_f9o0xx,1583811533.0,"I was with a 4th grade class the other week and it was like I wasn’t even in the classroom half the time. Walking around doing whatever they pleased, had to yell over them to get their attention multiple times, got told that I shouldn’t be a substitute and how upset she was that I was there, multiple students yelling and fighting with each other that I had no control over. When I’m encountering a student who is saying negative things about themselves or me I typically do my best to say super positive things back to them, but damn, by the end of the day I was so freaking over the disrespect I couldn’t help but be in an awful mood the rest of the day. I also felt terrible for the students who were actually trying to listen and do the right thing"
SubstituteTeach,fk2t0zr,t3_fccix7,1583808481.0,For the most part I’ve been able to have assignments filled for a week or two in advance but I’m between 2 districts with a total of 9 schools so what I really hated was not being able to get comfortable in one place because I wasn’t there often enough. Fortunately I landed a building sub job that’s starting soon and will be in the same building 5 days a week! It’ll be a nice change to know where I’m going everyday
