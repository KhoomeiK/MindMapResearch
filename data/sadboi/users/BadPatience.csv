I really would like to be a bit stronger. I can't work because I can't stand for more than one hour without having pain.

Going to gym is not painful for me. I like it. But I would find it overwhelming going every day. And like I said the cycles of steroids even on low dose give me horrible acne."

Also I love cotton ear buds. But I rarely use them because one day I was cleaning my ear and it bled. Maybe it was because minutes ago I was listening to high music for almost two hours straight (I rarely do that) with the headphones on. But that kind lf bleeding wasn't pleasant, my head hurt and I was worried about losing hearing. Ears are another world."

This may sound stupid but I wonder if I would see any results from taking steroids only when I excercise. Before quarentine I used to go three days per week to the gym and now I rarely exercise. As you can see it would be stupid to take steroids and not exercise, so I wonder if there would be a small difference between taking only when lifting weight and not taking them at all. I don't want to have large muscles I just want to be a bit stronger. Also even short cycles give me horrible acne so I don't like taking steroids every day.

Thanks"
