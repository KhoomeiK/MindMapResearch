crazyexgirlfriend,foh6pe6,t1_fognazk,1587761138.0,I agree with everything you said except that the issue isn’t that people with Borderline don’t feel empathy. I have BPD and am motivated to help others and I see that in Rebecca. But we also desperately want to be loved and needed and important to someone else so sometimes our kindness is motivated by our trauma. That doesn’t mean we don’t care or experience deep empathy. A lot of people with BPD get so much hate IRL because people think that.

I’m really close to finishing my Bible degree, and based on basic theology, self-love is VERY New Age-y, which is why most Christians don’t agree with it. Self-denial is the goal.

Also the belief that we’re all sinners is literally the starting belief for Christianity. You can’t believe in a Savior if you don’t believe you need to be saved.

FundieSnark,fhj1sf5,t1_fhj0quz,1581636427.0,"Jesus wasn’t trying to stop rape (at least not specifically). God said all sex outside of marriage was wrong, so Jesus wasn’t telling the men to make sure they had enthusiastic consent first. (Not to mention that women were property.) I have an issue with people trying to fight biblical messaging with the red letters just because they sound nicer. Jesus is God, if you believe in the Triune God. Purity Culture is tied to an 80% rate of PTSD-like symptoms in women who endured the Movement (Linda Kay Klein). We can’t fix it with the Bible. It’s time for psychology and telling people sex is good and they own their bodies. 1 Corinthians 6:19 is talking about bodily autonomy and says, “You are NOT your own.” This is dangerous, and Paul is a follower of Jesus. His words are equal with the words of Jesus. I am speaking as one of an unknown number of people with Religious Trauma Syndrome and as someone almost finished earning a degree in Bible.

Also, you said Jesus doesn’t think natural urges are the problem, but he said if you’ve lusted you’ve already committed adultery. The heart is where sin happens, not the body (at least according to theology). The body simply reflects it."

Yes, there ARE boys taking this seriously. And Jesus is shaming sexuality, as much as we think he’s taking about how women have autonomy. There’s nothing wrong with arousal, and even objectification from a distance does not warrant years of shame and possibly self-harm. Please stop thinking this post will fix the trauma of Purity Culture. We have to protect everyone, including boys, from this messaging."

exchristian,fhdvf2s,t1_fhdomhy,1581503647.0,"I totally agree with everything you said here. However, it’s important to realize that the Bible tells one story that can be analyzed with countless lenses. The scarlet thread theory, the narrative you explored here, humanity’s fallen nature, and so many others, and yet they are all valid ways of analysis. In fact, to truly understand the story of the Christian God, one should seek to understand every possible view of the Bible, because they all bring believers to a new place of sanctification.

(Mind you, I think the Bible is absolute bull now, so most of what was said was out of my old, theologically-motivated brain.)
