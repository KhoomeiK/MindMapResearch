AskWomen,ffr6qsl,t3_euqq9x,1580151658.0,"I have a blog ([thenourishedmind.ca](https://thenourishedmind.ca)) where I take photos, develop recipes, write about nutrition and just let out everything I'm feeling! I love the idea of having delicious recipes that are healthy and also pretty to look at!"
Anxiety,ffqesap,t3_eui5mr,1580132438.0,"Yes! Couldn't agree more! I actually just wrote a post on the link between gut health + anxiety if anyone's interested: [https://thenourishedmind.ca/this-is-how-gut-health-affects-your-anxiety/](https://thenourishedmind.ca/this-is-how-gut-health-affects-your-anxiety/) . I've struggled with anxiety for yours, and find that when I'm eating better I'm *much* calmer. Oh, and also staying off [Dr.Google](https://Dr.Google)."
selfcare,ffqbxss,t3_eugoi0,1580129746.0,"My heart goes out to you--having struggled with both depression and anxiety, I understand how impossibly hard it feels to get out it when you're in it. I know you've tried a variety of different things (good for you!!), but have you had a look at your diet + nutrition? There's strong evidence that what you eat can worsen depression! It seems you've tried a lot of other modalities, and it may be worth implementing a few of the following to see if it helps:

\- get enough omega-3 fats (take a high quality supplement)

\- reduce your intake of sugar (which can mess with your hormones), vegetable oils + refined foods

\- eliminate any possible food allergies (the link between gluten + mood is quite strong!) 

\- eat probiotic rich foods (yogurt, sauerkraut, kimchi, miso, tempeh, etc)

I'd definitely recommend checking out books like Genius Foods + Grain Brain to see more of the research behind it. I also wrote a post on my blog talking about the link between anxiety and gut health (and depression and anxiety are often two sides of the same coin!) which you can read here: [https://thenourishedmind.ca/this-is-how-gut-health-affects-your-anxiety/](https://thenourishedmind.ca/this-is-how-gut-health-affects-your-anxiety/) 

This is just one more aspect of the brain health to consider, and it works best when combined with other modalities like therapy, community + self care. Above all, know that depression is not your fault! We're here for you!"
