Miranda is a different type of character. Red lipstick and a frown doesn't make a drag queen just like how suits and a guy don't make James Bond a drag king.

Now back to Aurora, she looks like a beautiful woman because she is. It is just like how Violet Chachki or Asia O'Hara or any other beautiful drag queen performers while looking soft and feminine. Tis just another type of drag. 

There are so many types of drag out there beyond what Drag Race is capable of showing.
