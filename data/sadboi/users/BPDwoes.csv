Sadly not much better... it gets better for a day or two, then SO does something that I have repeatedly asked them not to do, I get upset, SO justifies their behavior (you made me forget because you're always pestering me), then says it's my problem because of my mental illness...I get even angrier and end up back in my room or at my parent's house.

As far as therapy, well... the therapist cancelled my appointment because he called in sick. 3 hours before my first appointment?! Needless to say that I'm searching for another therapist. 
I may have found one but I don't hold much hope. The ""welcome"" letter they sent me(they called it that) was a demand for a credit card to keep on file. Sorry don't have one and I'll be damned if I'm giving them my bank card! I'm still going to go and politely decline the credit card request and see where it goes from there. ü§û
