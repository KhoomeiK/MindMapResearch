Consider ALL factors. There were SIX items in that order, you bet your ass those items weren‚Äôt even done being made by the time you go to pickup. It‚Äôs people like you that make offers like this acceptable. Have more self respect!!! :( you would be waiting 20 extra minutes on a stack to disrespect the customers first order that the customer probably tipped good on, to waste your own time and the time of the good customer for a second order that disrespects all parties involved. The restaurant even because they get 30% taken out to have an angry dasher pick up the food and most likely deliver a mediocre experience from a bad payout thus placing a reputation on the restaurants service as well bcuz people are stupid and think we represent each restaurant. And do you want to know why this chain event happens? Because people LOWER THEMSELVES TO the standards of imbeciles. 

FOR EVERYONE LIKE JOHNNY DO YOURSELVES A FAVOR,, and CONSIDER ALL FACTORS! And if you can‚Äôt, please reference this beautiful explanation for why you are failing dash analytics and on making good money. Now that you‚Äôve been educated, I hope you reconsider your self worth and the VALUE OF YOUR CAR TOO. Good night.

IF YOU ARE COGNITIVELY COMPLEX, that is YOU SEE THE GRAY IN THE BLACK AND WHITE OF EVERYDAY SITUATIONS (a sign of TRUE INTELLIGENCE, Not becoming offended and trying to educate someone who clearly didn‚Äôt ask you to!) you would see that communism exploits peoples place in society and their money ultimately, because there‚Äôs so such thing as the ‚Äúequal‚Äù in communism. 

So, consider my point from that viewpoint of communism. These psychs take advantage of people‚Äôs helpless place in society and their money, just like current communism does, REGARDLESS OF ITS TECHNICAL DEFINITION YOU CANNOT DENY THESE FACTS. REGARDLESS OF DEFINITION, the WAY THEY CARRY IT OUT IS DIFFERENT THEREFORE INVALIDATING YOUR DEFINITION, you cannot claim communism when that is NOT BEING PRACTICED IN THEORY, welcome to ACADEMIC DEBATE AND ARGUMENTATION. 

DEFINITIONS MEAN NOTHING WHEN THEIR CHARACTERISTICS ARENT PRACTICED.
So before you go insulting the 25 year old that MAY possibly be president one day, I would THINK LIKE AN ACADEMIC AND BE cognitively complex. And if you think I was offensive, GUESS WHAT WE ALL STEREOTYPE WE ALL DO IT REGARDLESS IF WE ADMIT. At least I‚Äôm not a fake asshole. :)"

So, despite my need to connect with others, I have realized that sometimes it is best to be alone and wait for the RIGHT people. It‚Äôs great to have ‚Äúfriends,‚Äù but these days there‚Äôs very few TRUE friends who will support you. So, I do 95% of my things alone. And you know what? I LOVE IT! I don‚Äôt have to worry about getting a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù birthday gifts, Christmas presents, etc. that‚Äôs the one positive. I‚Äôm super social too, and yet I still prefer to spend my time ALONE! The grass ain‚Äôt always greener my friend... you could be in a group and feel completely alone, as has happened to me multiple times! üôÇ

However, it is useful to make memories with others. We were built to connect. Are you close to your family and on good terms with them? Get close to THEM, because these are the people who have been there since day one and you‚Äôd be sad if you didn‚Äôt spend enough time with them before they pass.. I say this because I‚Äôve lost more than half my family in death. I‚Äôm 24 years old. Put your family close, and then if you really find someone you‚Äôd like to be your friend, go for it! But, be cautious about who you invite into your life! Okay, hopefully this helps? Don‚Äôt feel bad about being alone, but yet find a way to meet your need to connect. It doesn‚Äôt exist in many healthy forms these days anyways but, all of us have a need to belong to something...


For reference, I was a loner all the way up until 8th grade and today, I‚Äôve got friends but we don‚Äôt ever talk and so I‚Äôm alone almost 100% of the time. It‚Äôs part of being an adult too,.

Antipsychiatry,f3s5a3p,t1_f3p56xc,1571097203.0,"It‚Äôs weird because usually people have flu like symptoms on the first week of starting antipsychotics. They throw your immune system down and wreak havoc with your blood sugar. Those doctors shouldn‚Äôt have kept you on them if you were exhibiting flu-like symptoms. I think they‚Äôre called extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). I don‚Äôt know exactly what would help, but you can try to naturally raise your serotonin and dopamine again. 

You feel like a fraction of yourself from the personality loss due to the blocking of the serotonin and dopamine when you were on them. And unfortunately, it takes the brain a while to get back to using it when it was completely blocked for a period of time. Plus, the brain shrinks on those drugs, thus affecting intelligence and personality and energy. It drains energy because without dopamine, your CNS can‚Äôt be activated. And the CNS is what keeps us energetic (central nervous system). And then, when you block two major neurotransmitters, all the other ones go out of whack too. Serotonin also controls mood, so it robbed you of your personality by changing your moods and outlook. I‚Äôm so sorry. 

5-htp is supposed to naturally raise serotonin, and
 l-tyrosine raises dopamine levels in the brain. Do a google search, and order some if you‚Äôd like. I‚Äôve had both, and I think they may help restore your brain a little. It may or may not go fully back to normal, but you will at least be able to feel and have a life when your dopamine and serotonin get back to a better ‚Äúbalance.‚Äù"

It‚Äôll probably be about a year before things get back to normal. Sometimes, when people go off of them, they get everything back but it‚Äôs super sensitive. I hope that eventually becomes the case for you. The body was out of a homeostatic state when it took those drugs, so it has to find a new homeostasis.

Antipsychiatry,f3m4k9b,t3_dha3bw,1570982959.0,"Antipsychotics mess with your serotonin, which helps produce HORMONES and helps your mood naturally. Antipsychotics BLOCK the action of the hta2 serotonin receptors and dopamine d2 and d3 receptors. Your personality and intelligence are dead because your brain requires dopamine to Signal
Messages across the cell, and those dopamine and serotonin receptors are highly concentrated in the FRONTAL LOBE which is also why antipsychotics kill personality. It‚Äôs also why people get tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder caused by antipsychotics because their bodies lose control of its physical functioning, due to the suppression of the d2 and d3 receptors, which also control movement. Schizophrenics benefit from this because if they are in a catatonic state, they stay in the same position for HOURS, and these drugs help them to not go catatonic. 

They‚Äôre called NEUROLEPTICS, which is basically a chemical lobotomy in your brain. IF you don‚Äôt have schizophrenia, I highly recommend RUNNING AS FAR AWAY AS POSSIBLE from these permanent life-ruining drugs. Your sleep schedule, periods, hormones, reactions, brain speed, and ability to think clearly are greatly suppressed, as I experienced myself and heard from MOST other people. Oh, and DONT FORGET about the diabetes and impossible to lose weight! They fuck up your health, too! They made me tear my meniscus because I got SO FAT!!! I packed on TWENTY POUNDS the first week I took abilify! Quit it like hot cakes after I was out of the hospital..

If you do research, those with mental illnesses who rely on antipsychotics for even just a few years LOSE anywhere from 10 to 20 years of their life because they literally kill you and cause terrible inflammation because your brain was NOT ever Supposed to function without dopamine or serotonin!! Research it, you will find shocking statistics that will just diminish your faith more! I‚Äôm not trying to be a negative nelly here, it‚Äôs out there and ITS SCARY AS HELL. 

Just another warning for ya, if you decide to stick with them. If it works and you approve, I wish nothing but the best. But, if your instinct is telling you EVEN IN THE SLIGHTEST BIT that this drug is harming you, stop it immediately because your instinct is right! Don‚Äôt ignore it.

You‚Äôll have a lot of whys...

But somewhere, underneath the deep pain of losing purpose, and another human that we put our efforts into.... it pays us back in little ways. And I believe it‚Äôs miraculous really. But there will be moments where you will feel her there, or a song or scent or somebody says or does something that reminds you of your sister. I‚Äôm telling you.
