Once was in 2014, I was on exchange in Switzerland. Went on what was supposed to be an 7 hour return hike with my boyfriend at the time at Creux du Van.

At the top of the hike, we were running through fields of tall grass, and somehow my phone dropped out of my boyfriend's pocket. We were searching in the grass for several hours and it was starting to get dark.

I knew it was a lost cause, so sadly admitted defeat and decided to make the 3.5 hour hike back down. But we were so defeated we weren't really looking out where we were going on the trail, and somehow deviated from it.

Next thing I know, we're literally hanging on for our lives, climbing this rocky cliff trying to find our way back on the trail. One wrong foot and the rocks beneath us would give out and we'd plunge to our death. I was on my hands and knees just trying to not fall, and I didn't even have my phone to call for help.

We managed to eventually crawl our way back the way we came and it was such a huge relief when we found the main hiking trail again, but at this point the sun had already set. I ended up slipping on cow poo because i couldn't see where I was going.

Anyway, we ended up back at my student accommodation by midnight (so a total of around 12 hours hiking/being lost) and I was going through footage I had taken on my DSLR... And I was able to slow a clip I had shot of my boyfriend jumping in the tall grass, zoom in to his pocket, slow it down... And there was my phone, falling out of his pocket.



The other time was with another boyfriend in high school. He was mad at me that day, and he was driving in the rain with me in the passenger seat. He wanted to express his anger by racing some car next to him. He must have been going at around 180km/h in the rain, and then we hit a bend in the road and he lost control of the car. In that moment everything was a blur, I remember him screaming at me ""IM SO SORRY"" while the car spun out of control, clipped a power pole and smashed back-first into someone's residential fence. I remember I was completely soaked - at first I thought it was blood but it turned out the can of Pepsi in the drink holder has spilt everywhere.

Anyway, the car was written off. If anyone had been in the backseat, they'd be dead. If the car hadnt just clipped the power pole, we'd be dead.



And here I am, still alive and occasionally wishing I was dead / trying to die :)"

I've had many boyfriends who wanted to break up but I would cling on for dear life, even though I knew I had to let go for everyone's sanity, but  BPD really makes you fear that abandonment, especially when it's your ""favourite person"" who's leaving.

For your sanity, I guess the best option is to just break off contact with her. Block her and move on with your life. She'll be a bloody mess, she'll probably want to kill herself, she might even come close... but at least she won't drag you into it.

My ex boyfriend blocked me, moved on with his life, found a new girlfriend and from what I can see from the outside looking in, he's much happier. It's been two years and it still hurts for me, but I'm both happy and resentful that he's better off without me.

For her sake, I hope she seeks professional help. It's not easy living with BPD and I think it's unfair that we seek help from those who just can't give it to us.
