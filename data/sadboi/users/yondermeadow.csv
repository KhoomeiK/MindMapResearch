Hi there.  I completely understand this. Although I haven't hated myself since I was younger, sometimes I get so frustrated with my inability to function that I get this exact same urge. It's so weird! Part of the urge for me is that I want to understand what's going on in there, so that I can fix myself and do a better job at things.

I do hope you feel better. You didn't really ask for my advice, but the way I see it you have two separate issues. 1) You hate yourself and 2) you can't do any productive work. While these can interact with each other,  my advice is to address each one separately. 

Start with baby steps on both fronts. Try to find something small that you can appreciate about yourself each day, and try to accomplish one tiny thing each day. Work to build habits to get you into a new, better mindset that will be less painful. Habits are everything."

Economics in general is neutral to how much government should intervene in markets.
