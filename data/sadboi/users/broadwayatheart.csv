A few months ago, I saw an Instagram post where literally all of my friends were having a Christmas gift exchange, and no one thought to invite me. It sucks. All I wanted to do the rest of the week was end it all. But I didn’t. And I’m glad I didn’t, now, because a lot of good stuff has happened to me since then. And good things will happen to you too. It just takes time. 

There’s a reason that you are too afraid to end your life, because you know that you will be missed. You ate afraid to hurt the people you’re close to, no matter how distant they may feel from you now. I have experienced everything you are going through now, for a very long time.

I do not feel entitled to campaign for anyone. I believe the world is severely unjust and needs to be fixed, but I don’t feel like that is my job. My job is to help the people around me, and my little sister is one of the most important people in my life. I understand my privilege, and that is something that I want her to understand as well. 

I was not becoming hysterical. When I was explaining everything to my sister in simple terms, it hit me hard. I had never really thought about everything all at once, especially in explaining the way that 7 old white men made millions of lives so much worse. That was what I was trying to teach her, that the plessy v Ferguson case had a huge world impact and is still impacting lives today. 

I did go to a diverse middle school, where I saw and experienced racism. My sister doesn’t go to a school like that. There’s no way for me to show her my experience with it, my best bet was to give her examples which she could understand and then back it up with statistics from a paper I wrote a few years ago. 

I do not believe that I have reached “enlightenment” because I care about racism. The thing I want More than anything is equality - for all religions, races, genders, sexualities, mental health conditions, socio-economic classes, etc. I do what I can to help these issues come to pass, but I don’t know everything and I certainly am not enlightened. Nobody needs me as their “savior”. I’m not here to save anyone. I try to help when I can, but honestly I can’t do much. What I can do is try to help my little sister understand that there are big issues in the world, and that history is a great clue to help us figure them out. 

I don’t expect for her thoughts to be mine or even to be like mine, but I expect her, at 14 to have thoughts about more than just herself. 

I, being gay and white, have experienced some unique circumstances regarding discrimination in my past. What I said in this post does not entirely mirror what I truly think. I had a bad day and was exhausted, but was kept up thinking about things. I had to get it out, so I turned to reddit to complain. It was midnight and I was not thinking entirely clearly. I’m sure that a lot of what I said can easily be taken the wrong way, but none of it was intentional. I was angry and tired and you can’t blame me for that. I don’t want to get into a pissing fight with an internet stranger, so I’m going to end it here."

Usually this means I end up sobbing in a bathroom stall. When my emotions run out, I take some deep breaths and rejoin the rest of the world. As for my depression, I find talking about it online really helps, and the biggest thing I do is focus on my passions as a distraction. For me this means writing, reading and performing, but it really just important that I'm not concentrating on my depression and that I stay busy.

Tell them that people identify as what they feel comfortable with. As a pan teen, I have met hundreds of people who think my sexuality is fake. It's real and it does not mean I love kitchenware. 

Bi means two - attracted to two genders (male and female) in the modern world this one has some wiggle room, but tends to be more restricting than pan
Pan means all - attracted to all genders (male, female, and everything in between) a pan person places no limits on who they can love. Sometimes pan can also mean all genders, but it's pretty rare. 
Fluid means having no fixed identity - going between genders according to the day, hour or minute, gender fluid people don't hold a gender form and move in between them, like a liquid would. 

Keep in mind, gender and sexuality are spectrums. Never limited to one thing. A straight man can find another man attractive and still not want to sleep with him. It's all relative, but a person doesn't choose a sexuality or gender, they are a sexuality or gender. HAPPY PRIDE EVERYONE 🏳️‍🌈🎉"

They told me everything about their life complaing constantly about their ex. It took a toll and yeah, we should have still been able to have a decent friendship with or without the girlfriend. I just don't know what to say or if it's worth it for me to say anything. Anyway this really helped. Thanks so much. Elliot is an asshole(ish)"

If you are direct and to the point, hopefully he will get the message, if not let your supervisor talk to him, then, hopefully Rick will be clear on what's been going on. If nothing else, show him this post..."

Advice,eqymuy8,t3_bzyftw,1560385937.0,"Honestly, from the amount of times you have said this guy made you uncomfortable, you NEED to report him. I'd suggest going to your supervisor casually, though. Ask your supervisor what they think you should do and make sure you let them know that Rick's comments made you uncomfortable, even if they were meant to be funny. In the meantime, talk to Rick directly. Tell him that you really didn't like what happened that night,and you want to keep the relationship very professional. Sit it out and make sure everything is kept super casual. Good luck!!"

I even saw a pride flag there once, drive twenty minutes away and there is a street where there are more Confederate flag than people. Some of the most hateful and homophobic people I've ever met, only 20 minutes away from my house. It makes me sick"

wholesomememes,eoxlgtf,t3_bteqxx,1558925608.0,"This speaks really deeply to me. I have battled with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts since I was in sixth grade. I used to have a lot of close calls. Even now, my first thought when I see a knife or razor blade, my first thought is how much damage I could do to myself with it. The only reason I am still here today is because I know that my best friend would have mad ether same mistake. I may not be of any value to myself, but there are people on this planet who need me. Thank you reddit, for being here when needed a break or place to find like-minded people... From my sexuality to my recent development of panic attacks, I have needed this place more than ever. You are all wonderful!!!"
