During my internship last year I had a student who wouldn’t lift a pen and when I asked other teachers about him they just said “he’s given up, he never cared”. They had just wrote him off as someone who wasn’t worth the effort. By the end of my internship he tried the hardest out of the entire class and I was so proud of him.

But like I’ve worked with enough students to know when a child is struggling to focus and be quiet because they have ADHD, and when they’re just being a brat. This kid was just a brat lol.

I have endless patience for the students who can’t stay still or keep blurting things out in class because I know why they’re behaving that way. 

This kid was just being rude to me the entire class because I was a sub and he thought he could get away with it."
adhdmeme,fkqrpbe,t1_fkqqmuy,1584454008.0,"In my experience, it is parents telling their children that they are not responsible for their actions. I grew up with parents and teachers that blamed my ADHD behaviours on myself and made me feel shitty, but now I’m encountering parents who have the attitude “he can’t help it because he has ADHD”. Obviously, as a person with ADHD, I recognize that a lot of things are a lot more difficult for us, but if we act like shitty people we need to own up to that. This kid in particular treated me with a level of disrespect I’m not used to and it’s just not how you’re supposed to treat other humans."
adhdmeme,fkqja2h,t3_fk44d6,1584447684.0,It’s actually very worrying to me that I’ve encountered several students who have this attitude that they have no control over themselves because they have ADHD.

My mental illness isn’t something I have to deal with everyday anymore, but when it does show up I’m with someone who can help me deal with it. 

In my previous relationship the guy I was with (for many years) would just shut down emotionally whenever I was very upset and never acted like he cared, even though he did, because he just wasn’t comfortable expressing emotions, and it made me feel desperately lonely for a long time. 

I was in a relationship before that I thought was fine but looking back was problematic. This isn’t that. It’s something based on mutual love and support which makes the both of us better and happier people. I don’t dump all my problems on him and say “fix me”, but I let him help carry some of them with me so I don’t drown  in them.
