AskReddit,fr1z24b,t3_gm0bz9,1589828362.0,This is my time to shine. I put my laundry in the trash and my trash in the laundry. Once I opened up a pack ramen and threw away the entire thing except for the wrapper.
AskReddit,fqzwznq,t1_fqyo4hz,1589777504.0,I am so confused... where does it start??
WritingPrompts,fqcuiwb,t3_ghv4zu,1589269400.0,"“How the mighty have fallen. Resorting to emotional manipulation won’t save you, nothing will. Not after everything you’ve done, everything you’ve taken from me.” Those were all the words she offered in return for my confession. A drop of blood made its way down her blade and onto the floor where I lay on my knees, I wasn’t sure if it was mine or hers. We both shed quite a bit of blood throughout the years; every clash, every meeting of our swords marked another battle for the death. At some point, my focus shifted from defeating her to admiring her. Her tenacity. Her persistence, regardless of her motives. 

During one particular battle where I had the upper hand, the realization hit me. She went in for a jab, a sloppy one might I add, I side stepped and had an opening. An opening that seemed to last an eternity. In that fraction of a second I thought about all my time with her. I realized that fighting for my life was surprisingly enjoyable when it involved her. Suddenly I hesitated and didn’t take opening. Which brings me to my current situation."
WritingPrompts,fq994dw,t3_ghgw5b,1589190074.0,"Azreal floated over the now desolate earth; scorched earth and lava were now the only inhabitants of this land. Along with the man made fumes that take up much of the air, the very fumes that ended their makers. Azreal landed on the top of a mountain flowing with lava, over looking what was once a lush valley but is now a pool of molten rock.

“They certainly were foolish from the very start but how did it come to this? This is definitely far from what was expected.” Azrael sighed, looking up at the smoke filled sky. A figure descended through the smoke: a demon, a very young one at that. The demon did not speak, he just stared at Azreal. Not with fear or apprehension, only a blank stare with a hint of curiosity. 

“Yes?” Said Azreal in an irritated tone. For the past century or so he has had no souls to reap, no purpose and no guidance. A demon disrupting his quasi-peace was definitely not welcome. 

“I was told that this was once a colorful land, full of beauty and wonder.” Said the young demon. His tail flicked about as he floated, still staring blankly at Azrael. 

“It was.” Replied Azrael. 

“You are Azrael, the angel of death. Am I mistaken?” 

Azrael put on a stoic face however he could not help but stifle a laugh at how brazen this young demon was, talking to the angel of death himself. Most feared even looking at Azrael, quite the lonely existence. 

“Indeed. State your purpose or be gone.” 

“I wanted to know if the angel of death would cease to exist if there were no dead for him to reap” said the demon, his tone calm and his face blank yet his eyes conveyed curiosity. “I do not know my purpose, surely if even you still exist I must have a purpose.” 

Azrael laughed. It was a deep laugh, one single exhalation, the first in many many years. The demons’ blank stare flinched, he did not expect such a thing from the angel of death himself. “I was born into this world with a purpose. You, on the other hand, get to choose a purpose. Be grateful for that freedom.” Said Azreal with a forlorn tone. 

“I see... What purpose will you choose then?” Said the demon, quite nonchalantly, as if he didn’t just ask the angel of death if he was going to change his divine mission. Once again this demon amused Azrael. Never before has he seen such a... odd creature. No fear, no quivering in place. Just a hint of curiosity, longing for a purpose. 

“That is a luxury I do not posses. I was given a duty and I must wait till I can fulfill it once more.” Azrael stated, shaking his head in the process. 

“Well, until then, will you choose a temporary purpose?” The demon said casually. Azrael thought for a long time while the demon stared with curiosity.  

“I’ve always wanted to see Hell. I suppose some exploration would be fine. Take me.” Azrael said while nodding, as if saying he likes his own idea. The demon was completely shocked at Azraels request, an angel going to hell was unheard of. Especially the angel of death himself."

WeightLossAdvice,foxhjo4,t3_g9v12n,1588144194.0,"There are lots of different possibilities. First of all make sure you’re counting your calories right if you’re eating 1200 a day you should be losing at least a pound each week. Second of all, and this is a very important one, weigh yourself in the same conditions every week, i weigh myself on Tuesday morning after fasting on Monday. It makes a HELL of a difference and it’s nothing less than essential if you want to accurately track your progress. Usually our body tries to resist weight loss, from its perspective it wants to keep as much fat as it can for survival. From experience all it takes is time, at some point your body is gonna adjust and you’ll start losing weight again. Just keep your calorie intake steady, I would say go up to 1400 each day cuz 1200 is very drastic and it’s probably why your body reacted so drastically. I hope this helps and feel free to ask questions :)"

WeightLossAdvice,fo2r9mf,t3_g56t31,1587472044.0,"I think you first need a very clear reason. You need a crystal clear reason, why do you want to have self discipline? After that it’s a matter of habit and process. You already know how those bursts of motivation go but that’s not what you want you want to build something sustainable so pick something to do and do it every day. When I started it was literally studying for 15 mins each day. Don’t push yourself here it can be small as fuck it can literally just be brushing your teeth for 2 mins instead of 1. What matters is that you make sure to do it every day. Sometimes I stop myself from doing certain things that I want to do/ force myself to do stuff just for the sake of self control. It can be completely stupid like playing a game that I’ve been wanting to play but just haven’t. As long as you’re practicing self control as long as you’re going against that voice that makes you procrastinate and give in and what not. This was a bit messy but I hope it helped. Let me know if you’ve got questions and ill try to explain better."

So my advice to you is try on clothes that didn’t fit you before or try on a size smaller than what you usually wear just to see if it fits any easier. Also for accurate weighing weigh yourself in the same spot, same conditions. I fast the day before I weigh myself and always weigh myself in the morning on Tuesday. Being consistent is very important because you can gain 2+ kg just from food being in your stomach and drinking water."
