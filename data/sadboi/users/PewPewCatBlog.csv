The nice thing about child birth is that the pain lasts for a minute to every few minutes while a kidney stone, you don't have any clue when the pain will end, but that was pre-water breaking for me. That being said, after the doc broke my water, the contractions I experienced after that were WAY worse than a kidney stone. But labor pains are not the same for every woman... I had back labor even though my kid was not sunny side up which is rare."
NewParents,fpuxvec,t3_gfoh34,1588927591.0,"I'm so sorry you are going through this. Have you talked to your Midwife or OB or general practitioner about these feelings? There is such thing as Postpartum Anxiety (PPA), and something as traumatic as your little one being in the NICU could most definitely trigger this. Did your hospital give you resources for Postpartum Depression? If so, I would suggest reaching out to those resources and telling them about these feelings.

Laura Prepon (Donna from That 70s Show / Orange is the New Black) actually wrote a book on her experiences with PPA in her new book [You & I, as Mothers](https://www.abramsbooks.com/product/you-and-i-as-mothers_9781419742972/) which is how I learned of PPA through an interview she did. I haven't read it, but it might be worth it to you to read about someone else's experiences with PPA, the feelings she went through and what she did to cope. 

You've got this. You are strong, especially since you have gotten this far with your little one being in the NICU for 20 days. Please reach out to those resources if you have them."

I don't really use Snapchat, only to communicate with my brother, and Instagram I just use to follow things that make me happy. Like positive influences like Jameela Jamil, or actors from my favorite TV shows, or my local animal shelters. But use Snapchat and Instagram as a tool to only deliver you happy things that make you smile, not things to make you judge or feel bad about yourself. 

Next, something that helped me with stuttering and my anxiety was reading self help books about anxiety and perfectionism. The book How to Win Friends and Influence People should be read by all IMO, and read often. Those were all tools I used to help myself. From there, find some hobbies and go to meetups where people who also enjoy that hobby go to. Or go take a cooking class for singles or just single people who want to make friends. Or maybe join a fitness class at a local gym.

Right now I'm seeing a psychotherapist, and she is helping me learn tools to help control my anxiety better. I highly suggest therapy.  

I wish you luck."

I wasn't surprised by my Nmom's reaction... She gave me shit for needing braces when I was a child, and doesn't see animals as part of the family. That's just who she is... But now that she wants to be more apart of my pregnancy (only decided a month and a half ago she wants to be apart of it, I'm DUE in a month) she's taken an interest in my fur baby and asks about him all the time... Probably to show me that she can be loving and caring... It won't last long. I'm used to this roller coaster."

I just had to spend almost 10k on medical bills for one of my kitties in December/January  (he had a blocked urethra, and had to have the PU surgery) and NMom told me that one day I'd regret spending that money on him. There's no way I could ever have that regret, ever. He's my baby, even though I'm pregnant with my first baby. Both my fur babies are my babies and my baby will be my baby too."

I always wanted it, but could only afford the Associate's degree I had. I was working administrative assistant positions at the time and was exhausted from my boss always using me to do HER work so she could work her shitty MLM, and would get furious with me when I wasn't able to handle the job. Mind you, I was being paid $12 an hour while she was being paid $60ish and getting any bonuses that should have been partially going to me as well. So my boyfriend (now husband) and his parents at the time convinced me to quit my job, which I did and offered to pay for me to get my degree. So I did, and I just graduated with it this past December!"

pregnant,fj3mv87,t3_fb7fo4,1582988171.0,"My mother has been doing this lately, demanding that she be in the delivery room, demanding to see the baby often after she's born. That she's the grandma and should be apart of this. Currently I live an hour away from my mom, but my husband and I are planning on moving in with his parents for a month after the baby is born. They are Chinese and practice postpartum confinement, but thankfully his parents are not too intrusive, and are embarrassed about their English so they typically leave me be and respect my space. They're giving us the main bedroom that comes with a bathroom connected, his mom loves to cook and will do most if not all cooking (my husband will do the rest), and will do laundry, help me take care of my cats who will move in with us, and clean so all I have to do is take care of the baby. The best part about it, is that they live almost 2 hours away from my mom. So that will cut down on visits. 

All I can say is OP, is if they are staying with you... Your priority is your baby and healing your body, and don't cook or clean for them. If they are staying with you after your baby is born, put them to work. I know it feels weird, but your priority should be yourself and your little girl during this time."

AskWomen,fj0t5g8,t3_fatvv7,1582907215.0,"Estranged, there is no relationship there and hasn't been since I was 13 (I'm 32 this year.) He molested me during the divorce with my mom (I was 4) but since there was no semen in the rape kit it was ignored, he married a horrible wretched woman when I was 8 who was emotionally and psychologically abusive and controlling. I lost all respect and love for him after a day of being abused by his wife about a court order which I had no control over bc I was 10 for f***s sake, and when he got home I cried to him for just any form of emotional support and comfort and he pushed me away and read his god damned newspaper. Luckily when I was 13, my little bro pissed him off during my volleyball practice we were at and he left us there at the gym even though it was his weekend to take us. 

Anywhoo... It affected me pretty bad. I really didn't trust men for a long long time, and dating white men was especially rough for me (I'm white). I didn't really trust anyone who was too much bigger than me, and if they yelled, I was out. 

Eventually I met my husband who is 1.) Not white 2.) An inch taller than me 3.) My arms are more muscular than his. Which helped my anxiety stricken self to say yes to a date. I was able to trust him pretty quickly, especially since he was very open with me and never lied which was an issue I had with both my parents. Honestly I'm so lucky to have him, and he's pushed me to be a better, healthier person both physically and mentally."
WomensHealth,fj0ptjt,t3_favqbv,1582905277.0,"I used Flo (App on my phone) to track my cycle, which also estimates when your next cycle is and possible ovulation (fertility) days. It asks you how you are feeling emotionally that day, if you have any discharge/random spotting, any pain experienced and weight gain. It's a great to track first day of last period which is beneficial when you go to the doc and they ask you. It also gives you insights and info about the female body. 

Also it's great for pregnancy, which OP hopefully won't have to worry about for a while. It helps me keep track of how far along I am in my pregnancy, and gives me tips and info about my changing body. 

I use a cycle tracker, my friends use it, it's great. Mostly since it's not a guessing game of when is your next period, you have somewhat of an idea."

Sooooo, idk how I would have changed those two things, but her not doing those things would have been appreciated. That was the only thing we had issues with and had a lovely wedding. 

I guess, maybe have gotten a videographer since our day was so perfect and no one took any video of it. Maybe have changed the dress too? I looked great in mine but I wasn't in love with it and pressured to buy it."
