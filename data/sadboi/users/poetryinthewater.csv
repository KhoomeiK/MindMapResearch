lgbt,fr5ow2t,t3_gmmc5k,1589912173.0,"There are kind ways to ask for more details from your friend, but don’t pry. It’s crucial that you respect their preferences if they tell you they don’t want to go into personal details.  You might be interested in reading “A Quick and Easy Guide To They/Them Pronouns” by Archie Bongiovanni or “A Quick and Easy Guide to Queer & Trans Identities” by Mady G and JR Zuckerberg. 

Speaking as a woman with a lot of cisgender privilege (I.e. I get lots of social benefits from conforming to the same gender I was assigned at birth): if this is not an experience you share with your friend (and it sounds like it’s not), I encourage you to do a bit of self-reflection and ask yourself why you feel it is so important to you to “understand” this person.  Is it truly because you want to become a close friend? If that’s the case, why not spend time learning more about the things you share in common with them?  Or, are your questions more about *you* and resolving *your* curiosity, discomfort, or whatever other feelings are coming up?  If that’s the case, it’s not your friend’s job to educate you or help you deal with your feelings.  Instead, do something to educate *yourself* and explore *why* it is so important for you to know details about someone else’s body like this.

Please know that I mean all of this with love and the hope that you can have a positive learning experience here that will bring you closer, not distance you, from your friend.  ❤️"

What I’m looking for the most is a genuine interest in this place and a willingness to learn.  This is also my first time ever modding so I’m having to learn along the way!

Since then I've stuck to carrying some sleeping bags, hats, socks, and local resource handbooks around in my car, but now the weather is warming up and I'm not so sure those are going to be as useful right now.
