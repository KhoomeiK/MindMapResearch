You'll never be the same person you were before your trauma and you only become a functional extension of your trauma."
PTSDCombat,fcg89ez,t1_fcaq41g,1577637505.0,You're right and I'm doing considerably better than I was just a few years back. I need to remind myself of that more often - it is just tough when the other person doesn't see it like that.
ptsd,fcajtfq,t1_fcajf5p,1577570570.0,"My wife often takes pictures of me while I'm staring off into the distance. She thinks I'm handsome, but, in reality, I'm just lost in my head.
I enjoy things, I really do. But it's almost as if I never crave anything. I'm lucky enough that I don't have to work to live (my disability check allows me to do what I want), and yet I can't find comfort anywhere. Everything I try my hands at, I get bored of."

ptsd,fcah3xk,t3_egwb6s,1577569139.0,"I find myself in a similar situation. I make much more than my bills, yet somehow, I find a way to spend all of my money. And there's no level of importance - i could spend $800 on drugs or on fast food and unnecessary entertainment, or on something I saw in an ad, I just need to spend all of my money and I dont fucking know why!"
PTSDCombat,fca78a3,t3_d0mfkg,1577564092.0," I'm really excited to try these treatments. I'm doing Alpha Stim right now and it is amazing. It works to recreate the pathways that are broken, rather than fix the broken ones."
PTSDCombat,fca6wzt,t3_d58xey,1577563954.0,Social media just allows you to see which one of your battles succumbed to their demons that week. It can fuck off.

PTSDCombat,fca2yi6,t3_eao4i3,1577562313.0,"First and foremost, if you love her and want to work with her, understand that she has no idea what the fuck or why the fuck any of this is going on in her head. She's going to be too embarrassed to talk to a non combat vet about. You have to put all selfishness aside temporarily because any blame you put on her will just add to her confusion.

My first step was understanding what PTSD was and reading the symptoms. These thoughts and feelings shes having are not ""her"" as she knows herself, so be patient while she figures it out."
PTSDCombat,fca2cne,t3_egmoxc,1577562014.0,"I won't speak on Canadian services, as they are likely different from those in the U.S, but I can speak to video games being a great form of therapy. 
For me, my way of adapting, albeit unhealthy, is to make each day go by as fast as I can. Whether thats with drugs, alcohol or video games, video games seems to be the healthiest option."
PTSDCombat,fca0vg8,t1_fc9z8pr,1577561183.0,"The shot isn't permanent, though, so if you have the opportunity to try it, I suggest it.
 I've started using something called Alpha Stim through the VA. It's electrotherapy that you do on your own and it has helped me a lot. Worth looking into now that the VA has access to it"
PTSDCombat,fc9ye5r,t1_fc9ules,1577560059.0,"Yeah, of course.
You lose your ability to ""feel"". So, while your hands will stop shaking and you'll be able to focus on something or complete a task, you also won't react to your SO like they might want. You might not enjoy your kids recital. I don't like the shot because it takes away my choice. I don't enjoy getting irritated at the smallest things and punching a hole in the wall, but when I self medicate, I control the dose and time frame.

From another perspective, I have a friend whose family life has increased ten fold with the shot. Hos wife and kids were able to adapt with him. Rare, but it's possible"
PTSDCombat,fc9wpg0,t3_dgyejk,1577559318.0,"I use the VA for physical medicine, but rely on organizations like Wounded Warrior Project for my mental stability. Peer support groups without doctors, retreats with classes, constant events. The VA is a hospital environment, but going to a football game with a bunch of combat vets is healthy as fuck.
I was trying to off myself in Hawaii back in 2015. I had done a great job of digging my own grave and decided to buy a one way ticket to Hawaii and end it there. (For me, then, it was a way to lessen the burden on my loved ones. An ""accidental death"" rather than a suicide).
I had $300 to my name, so I was stuck either way. I was on my way to attempt to drown myself when I walked across a WWP event for homeless vets and was pushed in. 4 and a half years later, I'm still miserable, but I'm alive and have had some amazing experiences and been able to share and help people. 

For me, I need to talk to a combat vet about once a week and that helps me."
PTSDCombat,fc9ul1f,t3_di0nt6,1577558444.0, You're just checking off the boxes of PTSD. It's so fucking confusing because you can't explain it. How could you lead men when you were in and now you can't fucking talk to a stranger without prepping and shaking? It takes time to come to terms... or so I've heard - I'm still waiting for that time. I tend to smoke (weed) my days away when I can't do it. I feel like years are going by while I'm accomplishing nothing other than arguments in my head.
PTSDCombat,fc9q8s8,t3_edskvg,1577556552.0,"Central Florida is shit for veteran services. I just moved from Orlando, but my friend in Clermont is working on starting a peer support group in the area. Kind of a bi weekly thing we did through Wounded Warrior Project he and I were a part of in Hawaii."
PTSDCombat,fc9ev7i,t3_edotb7,1577551624.0,"The SGB shot is a blessing and a curse. You stop acting out and feeling, so some parts of your life will get better. But you also stop feeling, so you're just kind of... there - and that also brings it's own share of difficulties."
