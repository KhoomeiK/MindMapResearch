LifeProTips,fqvekl0,t3_gkw24g,1589675607.0,"People always talk about chores and good work ethic but how about not sheltering your kids too much. My parents always instilled in me good work attributes, I always took the initiative growing up and gave 2000%. My parents always told me if you follow the rules, everything is going to be ok. I was deeply naive growing up and incredibly sheltered and always believed in the good of people, even when they used me. I didn't realize until the birth of my son that, you can follow the rules, be 1000% genuine, absolutely love and give the best of yourself to someone who will lie and deceive you for years. Now I'm in a position where I can't tell anyone the truth because I feel like a failure because of it. 

Basically don't shelter your kids. Tell them there are and can be dishonest people out there and that's ok, you shouldn't be afraid of confrontation or any type of conflict."
askwomenadvice,fqugckk,t3_gkp5zd,1589658520.0,"I just gave birth last week. I'm going to be dead honest with you. It's hard. Prior to birth, I gave it 200% to have a healthy and safe pregnancy. I ran up until week 34. Lost 31lbs. Are clean. Read and learned as much as I could about labor and delivery. I went to classes, met with other mother's, had a positive relationship with my OB, I actually was somber on my last appointment because she was legitimately a friend. Ok, I physically I was in my peak during pregnancy. I worked two jobs until week 35 and pretty much felt great. Physically I was going in feeling pretty confident. 

Now I have some anxiety and I knew that was going to play a role in my delivery and I knew going in, I cued my partner on how to help me cope with my anxiety, the big thing is I don't want to be told what to do but would rather be assured I'm doing a good job. So again, I thought I got all the bases covered.

I went in at 4cm dialted. I got the medication to start contractions and holy shit. The pain and discomfort was intense. I was an absolute mess and couldn't get comfortable. After seven hours of trying to dialate, nothing changed. My water broke and still nothing. I was in agony. I cried and cried and had to call my parents for reassurance, they said they never heard me in such distressed and started to cry on the phone, and they aren't criers, no one in my family is. I got the epidural, despite going in 10000% not wanting one but I was in the absolute height of anxiety. My mind was in overdrive, my body tense, I got the epidural and my body relaxed and I was immediately 10cm and ready to go.

The nurses said I would give birth in less than an hour, the doctor comes in and the chills and shakes come on. I was shaking uncontrollably and was told this was because of all the hormones and changes within. I couldn't focus, I had no strength to push and yet I pushed for FOUR HOURS STRAIGHT. the hardest thing of my life. I was put on oxygen and was told the stress I was experiencing was putting stress on the baby, so I was even more anxious and had so many crying episodes where the doctor said I was ""wasting each contraction and needed to focus"" otherwise she was going to go the C-section route. 

By the 5th hour he was finally out and I don't remember any of it. I was so anxious and exhausted. I don't remember his cry, him coming out, holding him or anything. It wasn't a bad moment but it wasn't a happy one. All I know is once he was out, my body felt like it's old self, like as if I was never pregnant. My anxiety was gone, the chills were gone, all the pain was gone in an instant. Imagine being in flight/fright mode and then, BOOM, as if you just woke up from a nap and you feel content. So surreal. 

All I know is I'll never have another kid. I don't ever want to give birth every again. I have a new appreciation for all mothers and those who have them back to back. The love I have for my son is insane and I'm amazed that I made this healthy perfect tiny person. But never again, never."

fitpregnancy,fllw9ok,t3_fourk8,1585269074.0,"I stopped cold turkey at 32 weeks, it was unbelievably uncomfortable and the recovery was just too much. I still have two jobs and running left me exhausted the following day, my plan was to run until the 34 week but my body had enough, 32 weeks and it's been nothing since but long walks after work. I miss it but I'll be back at it soon! Listen to your body, it will definitely tell you when enough is enough."

pregnant,flglgbe,t1_flfxqcv,1585145330.0,That's amazing! I really wanted to go that route but the few who did know said doing this would imply I'm ashamed of being pregnant. I held off until week 24.
LifeProTips,fldamtd,t3_fnye3a,1585060501.0,"Seriously! And go randomly during the week. Bought a house, looked pretty empty and chill. Didn't realize the neighbor had six cars and refuses to use his driveway at all, so all six cars are parked throughout the street parking. So sad and frustrating. He also likes to keep his empty garage open for four hours out of the day. I don't get it. Been this way for years."

I got 3 more weeks of work and then it's all baby time. I'm actually terrified to be off work, I've worked two jobs all my life even during college, this will be first time I had time off, I've saved up enough to be off until Aug/Sept and it's going to be so weird but I'm eager to learn how to be mom (SEND HELP)."
fitpregnancy,fkz8y2h,t1_fkz7gg5,1584665467.0,"Power walking was the absolute hardest thing for me compared to running.

I was running almost daily and lost 26 lbs this pregnancy until the 32 week and now I'm in so much discomfort I haven't ran or worked out. I gained 2 lbs this week and so far at this point I can't see myself running anymore until after delivery. 

I think at this point, listen to your body and maybe eat healthier. Focus on that rather than working out. Cramps are so painful and I was so worried when I started getting them by week 30 that I had to run down on the running and eventually just stop cold turkey."

The cramping and pelvic pain is so unbelievably bad. I can't handle it. I went from 20 miles a week to none, almost over night. This is my first child so I don't know if it's always like this. Have you had other children? How's your mileage? I say hold off or do a half. I feel so lost without running but my body is literally telling me NO."
AskReddit,fkrga6w,t3_fk3dzd,1584468287.0,"I lost my virginity at the age of 33. I tell people 31 (not that it makes it any better). I'm not ugly or unattractive, I was just was busy with college and career and I was really uncomfortable with the idea of having sex. 

At the age of 29 I figure I should start dating so by the age of 30 I got online and started dating. I dated 49 people that first year, it was huge learning experience. By 32 I met the person I lost my virginity to. By 33 I slept with him, I'm now 37 and we're having a son together. The situation isn't perfect but we're best friends and committed to our kid. I still sleep with him, he's the only man I've slept with. The sex is great, especially during pregnancy. I don't have remorse but my priority is my son, I don't see myself finding another partner any time soon.

Oh forgot to add, the first time was ok. I was really nervous and the actual act was quick but the foreplay before took over an hour, that was the best part, the kissing and touching and just gentleness of it all. It was all really new to me and the partner that I have is a giver and very into hands on/foreplay. I am very spoiled. We usually have sex in about an hour, minimum. When we have time it's usually two hours. 

It took about half a year to really enjoy sex and have an orgasm. I remember my first orgasm and it blew my mind. I was on the highest high and my body was on fire. I think, why couldn't I have done this sooner!?

ETA: I did not tell him I was a virgin until recently. He can't comprehend how I stayed a virgin, I think I'm average looking but I have been approached all my life by men due to my waist-ass ratio, this has been why I have been uncomfortable. I do not like being approached at all. The reason I slept with him was not only was he my type (slender, dark skin, had a beard, etc) but he never made a move. I asked if we could start kissing on the third date and a month in, I asked if we could spend the night."

I totally agree about what you said during that time during the race, the cat, the sign, the ocean, just the most random things can set one off. I hope you do well at your next marathon and congratulations on finishing! My dad did the LA marathon 15 times, I hope to at least do it once next year!"

running,fjgue4c,t3_fcowlv,1583335692.0,"I'm 30 weeks and still running daily. I actually did my best running during my 1st trimester. I didn't find out I was pregnant until 15 weeks. My period was always off since I was training for a marathon. 

But anyway, get ready for the pelvic pain! It hit me around 21 weeks and I was actually worried I'd have to stop running completely but wearing a band helped a great deal and after two weeks I was back to my old self until the pressure in my bladder was intense and these days I wear a pad to help cope. 

You're definitely going to get alot of ""you're harming the baby"" from those who don't run. As long as you're communicating with your OB and listening to your body, keep going. There is going to be some days where you won't be able to do ANYTHING and some days where you're going to want to run for three hours. 

I never had crazy nausea, I just couldn't eat. So I lost 31 lbs this pregnancy mostly due to working out and running daily but now finally week 28-30 I gained 4 lbs! I believe when you get to the 2nd trimester you're going to have so much energy. Stay focus and good luck! 

Running during pregnancy has made it all the more enjoyable. I got three races left before I give birth."
