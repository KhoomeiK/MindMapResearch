It was not revealed what the other spell was."

Reinhard's attacks can be blocked with DEATH knights (they have the skill to absorb any attack regardless of the damage it cause with 1HP remaining)
Regardless of whatever angle we look,Reinhard doesn't stand a chance against Nazarick, saying he can solo their entire cast is a bit too much,I mean Albedo can even with stand super tier spells without taking damage.The outcome of a 1vs1 btw Reinhard and floor guardians including sebas will be doubtful (assuming mare and aura are paired up).Shalltear's character is specifically made to combact warrior-caster hybrids(mentions in LN3,I guess)"
