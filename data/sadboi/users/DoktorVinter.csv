DashieXP,fr2rb0f,t3_gg7fw3,1589842396.0,"I feel I needed to comment here again even though I think I already commented before.. He just put out a video where he doesn't finish a game (unusual, right?) and says he'll ""maybe"" come back to it. That really messes with me. If I'm watching a gameplay, I'm not watching a trailer. I want to see the gamer doing their very best, and if they don't like the game - they should just be honest about it. But if he is enjoying it but just feels like it's too much work -for an alpha.. That's just lazy. And not in a funny way anymore. Sorry to put some pressure on him but this is his fulltime job for christ sakes. 2020 is the first year I've really put some pressure on him personally. I feel I'm entitled to this as a viewer and subscriber/follower. Idk about you guys though. I may be too hard on him, who knows? I just kinda wish he would finish the games he starts. Especially if they're just alpha or beta games - demos. He should be able to finish a game without us getting the videos to a certain amount of likes. I think people are leaving partly because he doesn't finish games. And that in turn makes his views and likes go down, which makes him desperate. Which makes him even less fun to watch. It's a whole circle of shit. But. Even though I sound very harsh in this comment, I really like him as a person, he has a good heart. I would recommend him taking at least 1 month off or go read/listen to this reddit thread and others."

Yeah okay, but you know I have a domestic partner, right?"" (but in a more casual wording, in my language.) And my heart just dropped. But I was like: ""Uh, but so do I, you know him! Right? Haa! Nah, I just wanted to get some new friends, that's all. I need to broaden my horizons"".

Maybe releasing too often, same old games, not being able to finish the games, not investigating stuff properly, not winning/completing any games etc..? I mean, of course he's beaten SOME games.

(I've watched basically all his old videos.) But yes, I feel the exact same way. For a great while I was excited whenever he posted something, but now I can wait at least 3 days before watching his newly released videos. I'm seeing the notifications but not ""feeling it"" if you know what I mean? And at the same time- are we allowed to complain or vent about this? Without a ""stan"" being like ""well don't watch him if you don't like him"".. Haha. But I kinda feel like.. As a youtuber, in order to grow and evolve, you have to change it up for your fans if you notice frustration. It's really important to read instructions in some games. That's why I laughed out loud when he casually said ""maybe I'll play the new Animal Crossing game?"" a while back. NO. Dashie - NO. Haha. That'll never work. At the same time - he has his own thing. He's Dashie, this is HIM. This is his ""thing"" I guess? Everybody has a thing.. Right?"

rapecounseling,fqiuqlu,t1_fqhot7e,1589401152.0,"Hello again. So.. Your whole post is quite focused on alcohol consumption. -Of course I get worried. And being that drunk that many times during Christmas isn't really ""normal"" according to me. But hey, I'm not judging you. I really am not. I'm only telling you what I'm seeing based on my knowledge on the subject. And no, I basically never drink, never really enjoy it. But I've lived on this earth for 27 years so over the years you kinda learn the signs of alcohol abuse. :) The point is I think you should look over your habits. And what I meant with you going back ""several times"" was that you contacted him again after the fact. So you were at the bar, he somehow got a hold of your passport (which is really weird, why not give it back?), you met at the bar again, you got drunk, he assaulted you, you forgot something there and went back, got drunk with him again & after the fact texted him while drunk. And then, the day after, reaching out again to accept his apology. Or did I miss something? Sorry if this all sounds harsh. I guess I'm so used to talking about stuff like this I'm not very good at being soft about it anymore.. :/ It's rape,  plain and simple. But I still feel the same way, that you should perhaps look over your habits. It is of course rape nonetheless though, don't get me wrong. The first time I was raped, I was drunk off my ass and probably drugged as well. I had a similar experience actually, but I woke up in his bed in the the early morning and ran out of his apartment and never looked back. Never looked at alcohol the same way either and didn't drink at all for about 4 months. I guess how you responded to your experience, although different than mine, tells me you seem to cope with your feelings through alcohol. But this could honestly just be me guessing. I actually don't know what you're going through. But I hope you can heal without alcohol. P.S. your age has nothing to do with whether you're abusing alcohol or not. Some kids have problems in their early teens. Not saying you do or did though."
rapecounseling,fqhmngw,t3_giaps1,1589380098.0,"It's more on her than you honestly, even if this isn't actually rape. You're having a toxic relationship. She was horny, you went along with it I suppose? But that doesn't mean she didn't do anything wrong. It's still wrong. I think better communication on both parts could have solved this. And actually, talking to her about it now should do the trick. Ask her how she feels about it. I think she just regrets it, nothing more."
rapecounseling,fqhker3,t3_giq4mr,1589378759.0,"Okay, this is hard for me to say. So I'm going to go ahead and say the positives first. Yes, this is 100% rape.

The negatives? You'll never get a conviction, since you kept going back to him. And, truth be told, you seem to need help with your drinking. Not because of the abuse, but because it seems you drank several days in a row and even after when texting him? I'm worried about you on that part. Like, really worried. Read what you wrote. How much you drank. And no matter how much you drink, he still doesn't get to have sex with you. It was never your fault. So the drinking is a whole other issue that I just noticed. Drinking could be a factor in what got you to the point of meeting him, since he's a bartender, but drinking didn't make him rape you. HE made him rape you.

Sorry to be this blunt. This post was really triggering for me, and I'm trying to be supportive. And everything I've said, I've said out of worry."

I know it's scary to tell people, especially as a male since there's this whole macho fucking idiot thing going on in the world. But you don't have to carry this shit. You really don't. I believe there are hotlines for assaulted men! I might need to look one up for you and get back to you, but you really need to talk to a professional about this. Maybe, when you've gone through it with someone professional, you can be honest with your uncle & friends/the rest of your family? & I would suggest never meeting that guy again by the way.

So, this is a really common thing. Too common I'd say. I felt it wholeheartedly. It's one of the reasons I said good bye to my boyfriend/fiance of 9 years. And also I lost all feelings for him. I'm now leaning into my homosexuality. I've thought I was bisexual since I was 13. But I dunno anymore.

Sorry, got sidetracked. The point is, yes, this is ""normal"" when you've gone through sexual trauma. Or physical trauma honestly, I don't think it needs to be sexual. And it's okay to not want to have sex. It's always your choice and you should take it slow if that's what your body is telling you. <3 Something that has really helped me is masturbation.

rapecounseling,fqhhcrv,t3_giwy89,1589377016.0,"I think that's a really healthy way to cope. If you look up the crisis steps, the anger is certainly a huge part of it. I also went from shame to anger.

And yeah, my aunt (60+ y.o) has begun hanging out with her grandkids now too, but outside only it seems. She has also been away changing tires, going for walks almost every day, grocery shopping. I should add that she's also at risk because of her low immune system. Before the virus, she was getting sick (like, really ill) from the flu and common colds at least 10 times a year, if not more. That's actually a lot, at her age it could be dangerous as well, if it continues. I get really sick once a year. 1 time. A. Year. And even I am staying inside almost 24/7.
