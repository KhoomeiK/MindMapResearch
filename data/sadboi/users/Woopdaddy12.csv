My RLS went away completely when I started eating healthier. Been years since I've felt that."
Anxiety,ewx7ogw,t1_ewx3en6,1565847491.0,Yep. Anxiety and stress cause all types of stomach and digestive issues.
Anxiety,ewx7mav,t1_ewx48hs,1565847421.0,"Yes, benzos or SSRIs or other things all have their own side effects.

If it's just at home and it helps you that's not too bad. You need to work on solving the root cause of these feelings though. You can look up some local places that offer mental health services. You should be able to find something in your budget.

Good luck!"

I personally feel it's just a cheap coping mechanism. Are you going to carry a doll your whole life?

Anxiety,ewwxw8o,t3_cqk7g2,1565838246.0,You need to talk to your doctor friend.
Anxiety,ewwxubn,t3_cqk7fq,1565838205.0,It's not normal and it's anxiety and possibly stress. I went through the same and it was hell. Talk to you doctor and be honest about how you feel.

Anxiety,ewwuvah,t3_cqjlqk,1565835957.0,"Cutting caffeine helps a ton, sometimes people have anxiety from the withdrawal though.

But I'm sure the Xanax is mostly what helps. That is a pretty hefty dose. If you're over 1mg a day you are in danger territory friend.

Be safe."
Anxiety,ewwtxap,t3_cqjnj8,1565835263.0,"Because you like her and your brain is releasing chemicals.

Sleep paralysis is common. It's extremely scary and you may be convinced you had a serizue but I'd bet you did not.

Best of luck. Don't sleep on your back and keep some white noise like the TV low or a night light on. The hag can't sit on your chest then ðŸ˜‰"

Anxiety,ewwc4wu,t1_ewwbqxz,1565825525.0,"Benzos should be used very sparingly. Switching to another benzo won't change that fact. Not much else helps outside of things that change brain chemistry, and that is a lot of trial and error.

Anxiety,eww13h8,t3_cqg6p2,1565818195.0,No. Be yourself. Making posts like this is just your mind trying to reinforce the bad habit. You don't need agreement from people doing the same bad thing.
Anxiety,eww0zka,t1_ewvy6u2,1565818127.0,"Yea, that's not a thing. Normal people don't delete or regret everything they say. You need to stop caring what others think so much. Digging yourself into a hole."

It will not get any better until you learn to assess all the feelings and how to cope. Either by yourself, with close friends, or another therapist. Maybe there is still hope there and you just can't see it, maybe there isn't. No one here can tell you.

Comfort and unconditional love don't sound like they are just going to pop up out of nowhere in this situation."
