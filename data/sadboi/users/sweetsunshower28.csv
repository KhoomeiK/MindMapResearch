Don't let the past block you from staying open to receiving a connection from the right person when they come along."
AskMen,fobyb64,t1_fobwhfh,1587665037.0,"That is a rather interesting viewpoint. I think for many, it's difficult for others to be so comfortable sexually with someone that is new to them. Stay safe ;)"
AskMen,fobxzhd,t1_fobwh4q,1587664931.0,"That's definitely true, tinder is known for that. So does that mean there are certain apps for certain intentions? They don't use Tinder they use ofc, hinge and bumble."
AskMen,fobxruo,t1_fobvxb3,1587664860.0,"Yeah I can totally understand what you're trying to say. (There's no way I could take it personally because you don't know my friends and I don't know you. I do appreciate your attention to this note.) 

But you do you make a good point, that it goes both ways on the impressions people give off versus the responses they receive. I wonder if sometimes girls want to show that they have a fun side to them, that they're not too serious and they think they look sexy in those photos so they can attract the right guys, but instead of finding guys who want to keep it very simple.  While guys like you who present themselves as stable and serious are attracting those who would want to leech off of your success."
AskMen,fobwx3h,t1_fobvl1i,1587664576.0,"Ah I see, okay sounds reasonable"
AskMen,fobwoar,t1_fobvdlj,1587664497.0,"Sounds like you're going through a rough time. It's good on you to remove yourself from something that was making me feel worse, you don't need that and you deserve time to heal and feel good about yourself. Maybe your breakup brought you into the dating scene with a different perspective that caused the experience to be more negative than positive for you. It will take time but most importantly patience with yourself.

(Edit for stupid errors from speak-to-text)"
AskMen,fobven1,t1_fobuujg,1587664090.0,"Yeah maybe there's an inconsistency with people's expectations for these apps. Some people go on there in search for someone they can connect more deeply, while others see it as a platform for hooking up. I'm wondering if it's unbalanced, with more people with the latter idea."
AskMen,fobv4d3,t1_fobufos,1587663999.0,Yeah the ghosting thing is a horrible part of our culture nowadays whether it be for romantic or friendship or even professional relations. Do you list out on your profile that you're go-with-the-flow kind of person? Maybe people are not as clear from the get-go where they stand.
AskMen,fobupdd,t1_fobubet,1587663867.0,"Do you still contact them with this intention even if their profile states that they are not in it for a casual fling?

Or do some people mistake certain apps for sometimes being for casual dating versus finding a serious relationship?"
gifs,fobgprl,t1_fob42sn,1587659616.0,The case of having a rosy retrospection: the remembering of the past as having been better than it really was.
childfree,fo7f4d5,t1_fo6mrbs,1587577271.0,"Yeah I laughed at their word choice. Anyone can see how many adults came from dysfunctional homes. Hell, jump on a crisis line platform and see the call/text volume 24/7."
