selfharm,fpc190y,t1_fpc0hr8,1588484428.0,"1 well know I do care about you a lot. 

2 one of my family members used to be really really degrading and just brutal to me. They where a very big reason as to why I cut. 
Honestly just pure mental strength is what got me though it mental strength I doubted I even had. I was basically like why let them have the satisfaction of manipulating me so? I just had to flip a switch not to care at all about what they said they obviously have issues. And have nothing better to do then to terrorize me. 
I’m a very visual person so me being the weirdo that I am actually went and flipped a light switch and when the light came on I was like okay I can do this. 
It was hard at times I just wanted to grab my blade and just utterly destroy my arms. And I did a few times. 
But I just had to rise above their stupidity. 
Will it hurt? Yes and it still does. Our relationship has improved but I still can’t trust them and I’ll always be wary of them. 
Sadly it’s usually people close to us that cause the most damage. 
And that’s just the twisted reality. 
All I can tell ya is your absolutely awesome. 
And you probably won’t believe that and you don’t haveto, But I believe it. So I’ll believe it enough for the both of us."
selfharm,fpc08t6,t3_gcl2kc,1588483568.0,"Yo im a girl but one of the things I hate the most. Is when people brush off the feelings and emotions of men. It seriously ticks me off! 
“Man up” is just so stupid. 
Part of being who you are is showing emotion. 
Emotions and feelings are beautiful. they’re so unique and different emotions are something that amaze me. 
Screw all those people who tell you and make you feel bad for being who you are. SCREW EM! 
If they ever ever tell you to “man up” or 
“Get over it” then they clearly don’t understand and are so flipping clueless.
It just frustrates me so much. 
I know this is easier said then done and I know I’m a girl so I will never truly understand you and what it feels like to have someone tell you those things. But,
Lemme tell you here and now that you’re so much better then them and their words can only hurt you if you let them. What they tell you is not truth. It may be their “truth” but hey let’s not make it yours. Ok?
I totally get you on the therapist thing I’ve gone to so many and finally when one of them actually helped me I completely moved countries. And now I’m living in a place that doesn’t offer any kind of psychological help.
Anyway just know your not alone. 
Those people are morons. ( I know I probably sounds childish saying that but yo! It’s true!)
Stay safe and stay strong. 
I believe in you."

selfharm,fp4xb9f,t1_fp4w2bo,1588309866.0,Yup I completely understand it’s a wack feeling ngl
selfharm,fp4x99y,t3_gbbqf4,1588309822.0,"For as long as I can remember I’ve been hard on myself. When I was younger I would hit and punch myself if I ever got embarrassed or anything. I didn’t even know what self harm was at the time. I blamed myself for every little thing. I would have bruises all over my body. 
Then when I was about 12 is when I first cut it was more like a scratch, really dull blade,
I consistently cut until I was 14 so for about 2 years. I have crippling severe depression and anxiety also some ptsd, I’ve struggled with eating disorders in the past as well. 
I had to get hospitalized once. And attempted suicide last year. 

While I was in the psych ward something crazy happened that changed my life. I found God simple as that. 
And my whole life has shifted. 
The scary thing about self harm is that it escalates. The more you do it the worse it gets. Kinda like a drug you build up tolerance and end up needing more. 
It really messed me up. 
I’m slowly on the road to recovery. 
I have been self harm free for 2 weeks and 3 days! I hope to make this clean streak last forever. But hey if I mess up I’ll get right back up and keep trying. 
Because I can do this. 
Gods on my side I can do anything. 
He loves me and has got me this far I have purpose. If I’m loved by the most high God. What more do I need? 
(And y’all, don’t attack me for my beliefs. They asked and I’m answering honestly.)
Another things that is helping me stop is because I what to try and help others dealing with the same stuff I have and am. And if I’m trapped in a destructive cycle I can’t fully Help Them without being hypocritical. 
Anyway there is a more of course to my story but if I told it all it would be waaaaay to long. 
Hehe thank you for asking! I think what you asked are really great questions!"
selfharm,fp4vy2l,t3_gbbukn,1588308810.0,Yeah I totally get what ya mean that happens to me too sometimes it’s like I’m watching myself from someone else’s point of view. Like a movie or something.

Thank you again! Stay strong."
selfharm,fp13gbg,t3_gap9et,1588223356.0,"I 100% get the feeling your talking about. It’s the same for me one moment I’m all about the self love and then I get into self hate mode and destroy myself. It hardcore sucks. I live in fear of crashing and doing something to myself I’ve actually been pretty low these days but this post helped me feel not so much alone. So thank you for that. We are beautiful people. And if you fall and crash hey that’s ok it’s just a set back you’ll pull yourself up and keep going because you are so amazingly strong. You are such a fricking amazing human. 
One thing I sometime try to do is I will write down a list of ""pillars"" When I’m in a good headspace I’ll write down things I know to be true. As in I’m strong. I’m beautiful. People love me. I am not alone. 
And I’ll write them all down and then when the earthquake comes those strong pillars of truth will hold me up. Because I can look back and be like oh when I was thinking rationally those where my truths. 
I don’t know if that made sense hehe I tried. 
We’r in this together and we can do it! 
Stay strong beautiful!

I’m sorry you feel that way I get the feeling all to well. 
I’m not going to yell at you but honestly self harm does break my heart i hate that I do it. But I hate even more that others do it because nobody deserves to feel like that. I’ve done it and still do but I’m trying to stop just cuz I wanna honestly I was kinda just like screw it, it’s like I’m challenging and competing against myself and that darkness that is in me. Maybe I’m playing with fire but hey I’ve made it 2 weeks today is my 14 day milestone actually. 
Ngl I thought I would be more excited but I’m not. I want to be tho...... 
and I will be I just need to change my perception. Perception is a powerful thing.
I believe everyone is capable of change and is capable of bettering themselves

Now that I look back I was close to complications but not death necessarily. Had I seen that much large amounts of blood leave my body before? No.  so yes I was terrified.

I’ll probably be deleting this post as it was very infuriating to some. 
But thank you for this comment. 
And yes if I tried again I know for a fact I would not fail. I failed once, I know where I went wrong. Won’t happen again.
Have good day!"
SelfHarmScars,fojaopo,t1_foiv8es,1587814906.0,"Wow hmmmm ok wow. 
I’m not quite sure how to respond. 
I’m not trying to justify I mean I’ll take down the post if it’s really that maddening to you and others. 
Attention really? 
I’m not sure what to say to that. 
I’m not going to say for how long how self harmed for because you’ll take that as me trying to boast for attention. 
But it’s long enough and self harm has destroyed my life. I want to stop so bad. I hide it every day and have never showed anyone scars except on here. I’m starting to think even here isn’t safe. 
You’re saying I do it for attention is very very hurtful. 
Maybe my suicide attempt isn’t as bad as others but wow. You have the audacity to tell me it’s a joke? 
I bled for hours, passed out and threw up from blood loss. 
Was i young? Yes 
That was a few years ago. 
Was I stupid? Yes 
Did I know vertical is the way to go? No 
And I’m glad I didn’t know. 
Just please, I get where your coming from. And I apologize that I offended you in any way. 
Again my body is like crazy good healer the doctors said my body creates extra of something which helps me heal (I didn’t understand all of what they said) 
But yeah it used to be like really weird and ugly looking. 
I still have minimal movement of that arm. 
I have severe nerve damage even tho it might not look like it.
I’m sorry if you think I’m doing this for attention again everyone is entitled to their own opinions at least I know the truth, so that’s all that really matters. 
In the twisted world of SH and suicide attempts, it’s the thought that counts. I had every intention of dying. But I was young, naive and stupid. Now after years I get where I went wrong. 
I’m not trying to make it sound worse then it is. I mean you can think whatever you want. 
But heads up next time really think before you speak and I will too. 
Because what you said could really make someone want to do it again. And not fail. 
Okay? Good luck to you. I wish you the best."
