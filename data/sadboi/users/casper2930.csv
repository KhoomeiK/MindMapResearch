selfharm,fpc190y,t1_fpc0hr8,1588484428.0,"1 well know I do care about you a lot. 

2 one of my family members used to be really really degrading and just brutal to me. They where a very big reason as to why I cut. 
Honestly just pure mental strength is what got me though it mental strength I doubted I even had. I was basically like why let them have the satisfaction of manipulating me so? I just had to flip a switch not to care at all about what they said they obviously have issues. And have nothing better to do then to terrorize me. 
I‚Äôm a very visual person so me being the weirdo that I am actually went and flipped a light switch and when the light came on I was like okay I can do this. 
It was hard at times I just wanted to grab my blade and just utterly destroy my arms. And I did a few times. 
But I just had to rise above their stupidity. 
Will it hurt? Yes and it still does. Our relationship has improved but I still can‚Äôt trust them and I‚Äôll always be wary of them. 
Sadly it‚Äôs usually people close to us that cause the most damage. 
And that‚Äôs just the twisted reality. 
All I can tell ya is your absolutely awesome. 
And you probably won‚Äôt believe that and you don‚Äôt haveto, But I believe it. So I‚Äôll believe it enough for the both of us."
selfharm,fpc08t6,t3_gcl2kc,1588483568.0,"Yo im a girl but one of the things I hate the most. Is when people brush off the feelings and emotions of men. It seriously ticks me off! 
‚ÄúMan up‚Äù is just so stupid. 
Part of being who you are is showing emotion. 
Emotions and feelings are beautiful. they‚Äôre so unique and different emotions are something that amaze me. 
Screw all those people who tell you and make you feel bad for being who you are. SCREW EM! 
If they ever ever tell you to ‚Äúman up‚Äù or 
‚ÄúGet over it‚Äù then they clearly don‚Äôt understand and are so flipping clueless.
It just frustrates me so much. 
I know this is easier said then done and I know I‚Äôm a girl so I will never truly understand you and what it feels like to have someone tell you those things. But,
Lemme tell you here and now that you‚Äôre so much better then them and their words can only hurt you if you let them. What they tell you is not truth. It may be their ‚Äútruth‚Äù but hey let‚Äôs not make it yours. Ok?
I totally get you on the therapist thing I‚Äôve gone to so many and finally when one of them actually helped me I completely moved countries. And now I‚Äôm living in a place that doesn‚Äôt offer any kind of psychological help.
Anyway just know your not alone. 
Those people are morons. ( I know I probably sounds childish saying that but yo! It‚Äôs true!)
Stay safe and stay strong. 
I believe in you."

selfharm,fp4xb9f,t1_fp4w2bo,1588309866.0,Yup I completely understand it‚Äôs a wack feeling ngl
selfharm,fp4x99y,t3_gbbqf4,1588309822.0,"For as long as I can remember I‚Äôve been hard on myself. When I was younger I would hit and punch myself if I ever got embarrassed or anything. I didn‚Äôt even know what self harm was at the time. I blamed myself for every little thing. I would have bruises all over my body. 
Then when I was about 12 is when I first cut it was more like a scratch, really dull blade,
I consistently cut until I was 14 so for about 2 years. I have crippling severe depression and anxiety also some ptsd, I‚Äôve struggled with eating disorders in the past as well. 
I had to get hospitalized once. And attempted suicide last year. 

While I was in the psych ward something crazy happened that changed my life. I found God simple as that. 
And my whole life has shifted. 
The scary thing about self harm is that it escalates. The more you do it the worse it gets. Kinda like a drug you build up tolerance and end up needing more. 
It really messed me up. 
I‚Äôm slowly on the road to recovery. 
I have been self harm free for 2 weeks and 3 days! I hope to make this clean streak last forever. But hey if I mess up I‚Äôll get right back up and keep trying. 
Because I can do this. 
Gods on my side I can do anything. 
He loves me and has got me this far I have purpose. If I‚Äôm loved by the most high God. What more do I need? 
(And y‚Äôall, don‚Äôt attack me for my beliefs. They asked and I‚Äôm answering honestly.)
Another things that is helping me stop is because I what to try and help others dealing with the same stuff I have and am. And if I‚Äôm trapped in a destructive cycle I can‚Äôt fully Help Them without being hypocritical. 
Anyway there is a more of course to my story but if I told it all it would be waaaaay to long. 
Hehe thank you for asking! I think what you asked are really great questions!"
selfharm,fp4vy2l,t3_gbbukn,1588308810.0,Yeah I totally get what ya mean that happens to me too sometimes it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm watching myself from someone else‚Äôs point of view. Like a movie or something.

selfharm,fp13gbg,t3_gap9et,1588223356.0,"I 100% get the feeling your talking about.

I live in fear of crashing and doing something to myself I‚Äôve actually been pretty low these days but this post helped me feel not so much alone. So thank you for that. We are beautiful people. And if you fall and crash hey that‚Äôs ok it‚Äôs just a set back you‚Äôll pull yourself up and keep going because you are so amazingly strong. You are such a fricking amazing human. 
One thing I sometime try to do is I will write down a list of ""pillars"" When I‚Äôm in a good headspace I‚Äôll write down things I know to be true. As in I‚Äôm strong. I‚Äôm beautiful. People love me. I am not alone. 
And I‚Äôll write them all down and then when the earthquake comes those strong pillars of truth will hold me up. Because I can look back and be like oh when I was thinking rationally those where my truths. 
I don‚Äôt know if that made sense hehe I tried. 
We‚Äôr in this together and we can do it!

I‚Äôve done it and still do but I‚Äôm trying to stop just cuz I wanna honestly I was kinda just like screw it, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm challenging and competing against myself and that darkness that is in me.

SelfHarmScars,fojaopo,t1_foiv8es,1587814906.0,"Wow hmmmm ok wow. 
I‚Äôm not quite sure how to respond. 
I‚Äôm not trying to justify I mean I‚Äôll take down the post if it‚Äôs really that maddening to you and others. 
Attention really? 
I‚Äôm not sure what to say to that. 
I‚Äôm not going to say for how long how self harmed for because you‚Äôll take that as me trying to boast for attention. 
But it‚Äôs long enough and self harm has destroyed my life. I want to stop so bad. I hide it every day and have never showed anyone scars except on here. I‚Äôm starting to think even here isn‚Äôt safe. 
You‚Äôre saying I do it for attention is very very hurtful. 
Maybe my suicide attempt isn‚Äôt as bad as others but wow. You have the audacity to tell me it‚Äôs a joke? 
I bled for hours, passed out and threw up from blood loss. 
Was i young? Yes 
That was a few years ago. 
Was I stupid? Yes 
Did I know vertical is the way to go? No 
And I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt know. 
Just please, I get where your coming from. And I apologize that I offended you in any way. 
Again my body is like crazy good healer the doctors said my body creates extra of something which helps me heal (I didn‚Äôt understand all of what they said) 
But yeah it used to be like really weird and ugly looking. 
I still have minimal movement of that arm. 
I have severe nerve damage even tho it might not look like it.
I‚Äôm sorry if you think I‚Äôm doing this for attention again everyone is entitled to their own opinions at least I know the truth, so that‚Äôs all that really matters. 
In the twisted world of SH and suicide attempts, it‚Äôs the thought that counts. I had every intention of dying. But I was young, naive and stupid. Now after years I get where I went wrong. 
I‚Äôm not trying to make it sound worse then it is. I mean you can think whatever you want. 
But heads up next time really think before you speak and I will too. 
Because what you said could really make someone want to do it again. And not fail. 
Okay? Good luck to you. I wish you the best."
