AskReddit,fooe7cx,t1_foobtbj,1587937381.0,"I'm not really sure what you don't understand here, there seems to be several points of miscommunication though:

1) Having the 10th highest homicide rate isn't ""middle of the road"",

2) math: If you have a place that's got half the homicide rates but 4x the population, it will have 2x the total homicides, and removing the big city from the numbers will have a bigger impact nationally

3) the context was always big cities, again for math reasons: there are small cities like Baton Rouge that have high rates, but you'd have too eliminate a lot of them to have the same impact as a big city, so we just say the big city instead of listing several small ones. The point is the same though: Homicides are largely contained to a few urban areas that aren't exactly tourist destinations anyway, so a European shouldn't be worried about visiting places like Colorado or NYC over fears of being murdered.

Lastly, how on earth can you look at a 1920's median life and say we don't have massively more purchasing power now??? I make 48k and have a family.

Compare that to a 1920's life: try to buy a far smaller, less polished, non-AC house, MAYBE buy a shitty car that'll break down all the time and is a death trap, and cook almost every meal at home. That's it- they didn't take vacations to Europe, most worked till they dropped, a very large % had gardens to provide themselves food.

I could but a 20 year old single wide trailer and that's honestly a nicer setup than the average middle class home in 1920 had, if for no other reason than it has plumbing, power, a refrigerator, and non-dirt floors. We could then get the shittiest van that runs (which is still far safer and more comfortable than what they drove), sell our other car (few families then had 2 vehicles), make a garden and can food to save at the store, have no phone or internet, and I'd STILL have a better quality of life than them. And how much money would that lifestyle take? $25k? 

Yeah some of our gains were just from technological growth, but no matter HOW you cut it life today is MASSIVELY better than it was 100 years ago.

That's simply very very very wrong on all accounts. IIRC it's been 40 years of wage stagnation- not 100. and 300-700% price hikes??? That's easily proven wrong by looking at cost of homes/cars/eggs from now vs 50 years ago and seeing what % of the median income it was. I did this a while ago for homes, the results were interesting: On a per square foot basis, homes now cost the same % of income as a new home in 1960 did. The problem is now we expect more space for a given family size, thus homes cost more. A 20k car today is about the same % of income as the typical car in 1960's, while lasting about 2x the miles, thus effectively making cars half as expensive.

so you're just ignoring the fact you were wrong when you said the Gov't ""loaned them in the first place""?

> Yes, which is why this plan is forgiving loans and not handing money away. 

yes, it is. Normally Gov't having to pay for a loan is extremely rare due to student loans not being able to be erased in a bankruptcy; since they never go away, they tend to get repaid. So yes, the Gov't paying 10k of everyone's loans = a massive amount more money than normal being handed away. yes handed, because unlike a loan it won't be repaid. 

Again though, the fact is what an economic stimulus is about is keeping the economy going. Debt forgiveness only frees up the relatively tiny monthly payment and thus is a horrible way to do it. If we make it through this crisis sure,  make your case that it's wise for us to take on more national debt to forgive student loans. But until we get this situation stabilized all efforts should be on the task at hand.

Anyway, I'd be lying if I said I was never one of those creeps you reference, because often I am. Truly sorry if that fact triggers you, I'm just trying to clarify which angle I see the problem from.

 Evolution selected for men who pass on their DNA. A high sex drive helps with that, as does wanting to fuck everything that moves even if it's mediocre in appearance. Empathy towards women is only useful insofar as it helps us manipulate them into trusting us enough so we can put a baby in them. The pre-historic man who said ""wait, I should sleep with this girl I don't want to support; what if she got pregnant and struggled to support herself without me?!"" will ALWAYS get outcompeted by the man who said ""sweet I get to try to make a baby at zero long term cost, so what if the mother and kid has a 50/50 chance of dying?"".

Personally, I HATE us men. It's not just the way we objectify women and view their eggs as pray, it's that we evolved to do tasks that are wholly irrelevant for modern day.  In the past surviving as a man meant physical labor, hunting, and fighting other tribes to maintain resources and territory and women. That's what testosterone does. None of that shit is remotely useful in a world where manual labor can't support a family, and where 99% of testosterone driven fights are over stupid stuff. The only aspect about men that's still valuable is our ambition to be at the top (top dog in a village of 50 males and 50 females got way more than just 1/50th of the women, so evolution selected men to have high risk high reward behaviors). Some men are able to take that drive and channel it into constructive paths. Most though don't channel it well. If women can grow sperm in a lab and gen edit the babies to be all girls I certainly wouldn't object to the radical feminists who said we should kill all men. Very very few of us are anything more than disgusting.

Back to checking out women though. Because biology drives us men to look for sex all the time, I don't blame myself for having my eyes stop on someone or scan them over. That's genuinely impossible to stop for me, even if I'm truly focused on something else and not horny at all in the moment. HOWEVER, the kind of creeps you and everyone else in this thread talk about aren't just doing a half second eye pause as they turn their head for some unrelated reason; they're straight up consciously viewing you sexually, as if you're for their pleasure. I personally have a switch inside me: when I fucking hate myself (ie am genuinely suicidal) I never go creep mode. When my ego is big I do. When I'm neither hating myself in shame or self indulging myself I might shamefully steal a 2nd glance at a pretty person, but I'd say I stay away from ""predator"" territory and if said pretty girl is aware of me I definitely wouldn't look her way again just because I don't want to make them uncomfortable.

Overall, the sad truth is I'm better than 90+% of guys when it comes to this stuff, which is incredibly sad. I genuinely want to kill myself everytime I think of how many girls I'm sure to have made uncomfortable over my life. Only way I can justify living in this regard is to 1) control my Ego so I don't go creep mode much, 2) continue to call out other guy's creepiness so maybe I can reduce the total amount of harm men inflict on women"

It's all about your own DNA getting passed on

In light of that, why wouldn't work (which is made up of people) try to abuse you for their gain? Why wouldn't a friend only be friends with you because you'll pay the bar tab/have funny jokes/make them feel prettier because you're not very pretty etc? Why wouldn't a BF only date you because it's in his best interest?

Classic close bonds like a mother to her kids, or a spouse to the other are supposed to be so strong the ""love"" causes great selfless acts. But even these are an obvious self serving facade on an evolutionary level: a mother sacrifices for her kids because her DNA get passed on through them; they are more important than her own life as far as evolution cares. And the spouse is only with that spouse because they are the best catch they could get. Love is just evolutions way of getting you to stick with the breeding pattern/resource provider. 

Why are kids so savage in cutting off the social rejects? Because even at that age the kids who would be good hunters or social leaders stand out, and evolution dictates you should be friends with the powerful vs weak. So, kids shun the uncool kids so they themselves can stay labeled a ""cool kid"" and not get shunned themselves. 10,000 years ago this would be an important way to make sure you get resources when times were hard, or gain social status and thus gain better breeding options. Historically the kids we grow up with = the adults we'll survive and play politics with

If you replaced the civilian with a cop, you'd have the same situation as the cop has nothing but a pistol on him and his body armor won't stop a rifle bullet. Are you saying it's better off having no cops on sight at the start of a mass shooting? 

2) That said, most of the time it's not a standoff. Concealed carry means the bad guy usually doesn't know you have a gun till you've pulled it, and even then only if he's paying attention to you specifically, which he usually isn't in a mass shooter situation.

2. Even if the fear of military deaths is the only thing stopping wars, a ""global ban"" on them won't stop everyone from doing it anyway. Every nation has bioweapons research. Every nation has secret weapons research. Every nation that can get them has nuclear weapons. Moreover, the intent of the law will be ignored. For example, the US military will have a drone that operates and identifies targets via AI... BUT, instead of killing them then, it sends a signal back to the ""pilot"" on some air force base who's supposed ot confirm the data. In practice, he'd just push the kill button immediately, making it effectively just an AI killer bot with a 3 second delay on when it shoots, but legally it's not ""autonomous"" and it has ""human oversight"". There's a million workarounds like this
3. Once the technology gets good enough, ""AI killer bots"" will be SAFER for the civilians as well. No more 18 year olds deciding whether or not to return fire at the Taliban guy in a crowd with children. No more panicked aiming. Just a computer coldly calculating where the threat is, what the risk to civilians are, precisely aiming the weapon, and following a precise order of operations. No more grenades thrown into a room with a family because the soldiers weren't going to risk finding out who was there. This is improvement for them too.

You might as well be protesting the use of machine guns before WW1, or bombers before WW2. Only this has the potential to reduce deaths, not increase them.

1) Of course women don't put ""stay at home mom"" on their resume (unless they're applying for a nanny position I guess); it's not relevant to employers. I don't put ""I know how to do basic car repairs"" on my resume because that has nothing to do with my job, even though it's something I've learned to save my family money. 

""Valued by society"" doesn't equal literally helps you get a job, which you know from talking about men being praised for their work.

And you've never heard someone say ""being a stay at home mom is the hardest job in the world""? or get praised? Really? You ask for a ""single source"". Google ""stay at home moms have the hardest job in the world""; top result is saying it isn't, 2nd result is saying it is, 3rd result is from /r/childfree quoting it as a reason to have no kids, 4th and 5th results are calling it the hardest job... clearly it's a thing that's said in pop culture. I remember hearing it as a kid

2) Juno. But in general, nobody makes movies about day to day life at all, and the home side of things is always underrepresented in all media because people don't want to see it;  why'd I watch my day to day life on TV, when I could watch something different? 

3) yes women have done stuff in wars. But you can't deny that the vast majority of it was done by men, so of course war movies are going to focus on it. Shit, it's rare to have a war movie in America that's not about an American war where you know, until recently women made up very very small portions of the front line ""exciting"" stuff. Now if a movie gets made about say, the French resistance or life in an aid station and it has no female main characters I'm with you, because women made up huge parts of both of those. But no, there's no women in Saving Private Ryan because there were no women in the 2nd rangers

4) Of course something like multiple sclerosis can change plans off of the simple layout I said. Also unplanned pregnancies, getting fired, a child having disabilities, extended family needing unexpected help... none of that automatically makes the prospect of raising a family any more ""exploitative"" or ""unfair"" against the mother relative to the father, so it's kinda irrelevant. Yes some situations will suck worse for her, some more for him, some for both equally, but none are forms of oppression placed on her my the male or society. And why are you talking about people needing sex and love in a conversation about how the incomes and housework gets divided up in a family?

It's usually consensual when coupled have kids. That's not classist.

If she's like my wife and wants family more than she wants to work then it's not exploitative. 

And lets not forget that being a stay at home parent is a perfectly valid thing to want and many women do, so their portion of the $10.8T economic value is certainly not exploitative. And to bring men into this, again there are many men working longer hours than they'd like too and doing more housework than they'd like too because they were coerced into having kids by a wife that wanted more. It cuts both ways. One of my coworkers os stressed as hell because his wife decided to not go back to work and that's not what they discussed before having kids.

If a woman 1) isn't at a place where she can have a child and maintain a career while the husband also works (ie make good money to pay for childcare), 2) can't earn enough money to support the family while the husband stays at home, AND 3) would rather keep keep working than stay at home with a child, then she shouldn't have kids. Those are and always will be the options at any given time for men and women: Work, stay at home, pay for child support as everyone works, or no kids. I won't deny many unhealthy relationships will have one trying to pressure the other to pick and option they don't want too, but I don't think that's the norm and when it does happen it cuts both ways: women can pressure men into having kids just as much as men can pressure working women to be a SAHM.

I do about half the housework as is and money tight so hell yeah I'd rather her be able to bring in a 2nd check. That's the kind of thing that happens if you want to have kids. If avoiding housework is the top priority don't have any. If they are an accident then divvy up total work (earning money + house and kid stuff) and it's no worse for one parent than the other.

But at the end of the day, she's not being oppressed any more than I am. If she worked and I stayed at home (I can earn more which is why we don't) then I wouldn't be oppressed either. I'd be doing some necessary task to live the family lifestyle we consensually chose when we had kids. Just because I'm not getting paid doesn't mean anything- we can either do it ourselves, or pay someone too. If we do it ourselves that's money saved, same as if we hired someone to do the housework and use the free time to work for that amount more. 

>The disconnect here isn't women being forced to breed and be house slaves.

Which is what I was referencing here

> Overall I think we should spend more time focusing on smaller scale issues like some men not doing any housework, or society's stigma against SAHDs 

Many men discount how hard housework is and so think they've done their share of the work when they really haven't, and still more men know they should do housework but they think they can get away with not. 

That is a far far cry from implying women deserve trillions of dollars for ""unpaid labor"" they do in the house.
