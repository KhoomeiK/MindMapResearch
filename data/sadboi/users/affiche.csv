I guess it must be that one oil they insist on putting in every product they sell? My skin disliking DE is definitely good for my bank balance at least! 

I waited to purchase The Inkey List products during a sale for similar reasons to you. Even though the HA serum is so basic, it does exactly what I want and I can see it being something I repurchase many more times. Hopefully the lighter, runnier texture won't mean that it's not hydrating enough for me during winter! The Inkey List niacinamide serum I've used a few times so far is leaps and bounds better than The Ordinary one. With the niacinamide serum from TO, I had *so* much pilling and my skin became super sensitised to it over time. I was never sure if it was TO's formula or the high percentage of niacinamide affecting me, so this has me optimistic that I can actually use 10% niacinamide if it's well-formulated. The one from The Inkey List is really silky (it's silicone-free if that's a concern) and hasn't pilled with my skincare or makeup I've tried it with. I've got a few other serums from them in my skincare drawer to try now! 

Oh, and I just remembered that the Paula's Choice Calm serum, which contains HA, was pretty hydrating and soothing when I used it previously. The First Aid Beauty Hydrating serum was also good, though I found it overpriced for what it did for my skin.

lululemon,f2ps22w,t3_ddzsce,1570349411.0,"That's only happened to me when they're too small.

(This style just doesn't work for my hourglass/pear shape.)

It sounds like you're sizing down in your Aligns and In Movements to get a tighter than standard fit if more compressive styles like the WU are too small in the same size. Everyone always says that Aligns fit big and you should size down, but I think Aligns run tts and people just don't like the naked feel."

lululemon,f2eq09s,t1_f2emsee,1570201568.0,"Wow, having 1000s of items sold over time does seem very off. I don't really know how the employee discount works, but I can imagine buying loads of the same item would raise red flags. I know some companies (e.g., Apple) have limits on how much employees can buy presumably for that reason. 

All of my WMTM leggings were around 70% off, so someone reselling leggings for 20% off RRP purchased that way would definitely still be making a significant profit. As I said, I've purchased and missed out on specific colours and styles that a week later all appear on eBay with multiple sizes and quantities of each pair available at an inflated price, so sweeping the (e-)shelf is definitely something done by resellers. If they actually manage to sell everything on at that higher price, these selfish assholes must be making thousands over time. 

I personally wouldn't take the risk with this seller when the discount is that small. It would always bug me wondering if I'd bought a fake."
lululemon,f2e8816,t1_f2dxudl,1570186049.0,"I've seen eBay sellers list multiple items that had previously been on WMTM *at a much lower price* (üôÑ) a few weeks prior, so I'm guessing it could also be a situation like that. The fact that they're more classic colours like black does make it seem a little suspicious, however. 

Side note: I wish Lululemon would impose an item limit to stop people from buying WMTM pieces in bulk. It's annoying af missing out on things in your size at 60-70% off and seeing mass quantities of different leggings and sizes in the exact same colours listed on eBay for at least double the WMTM price."

However, I ended up returning every item I bought for a few reasons. The pink and blue ones were totally see through in both sizes; the black leggings were see through in the size small. Size-wise, the small was tight in the legs and bum area (which combined with being see through was a total no) and the medium gaped a lot around the waist. I feel like all of their curvy models and influencers must be going for the smaller size and not wearing any underwear based on my experience. 

They also just looked and felt kinda cheap to me, and the compression and lack of compression in the Energy Seamless seemed to be in the wrong (i.e., unflattering) areas. The black leggings were the only ones I semi-liked the look of."

There are also groups you can join if you have issues like social anxiety. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, and make sure you're eating healthy food that will make you feel well. Start volunteering for a couple of organisations to build up some professional experience in different areas, and you should join some Meetup groups or sports clubs where you live to start making friends and acquaintances. You can start looking at college courses or jobs you think you'd like to do that don't require a degree at some point down the line if you completed high school. Alternatively, you can complete the GED or whatever your country's high school equivalency qualification is first if you dropped out. You can build up to actually applying for a job or college course once you've improved your mental health through therapy, volunteering and socialising. 

Being stuck in the past and how things could have been if your parents hadn't been xyz is extremely toxic to your wellbeing. You can't change what has happened to you as a child and its impact on your early adult years. You can, however, take control and change your future. Do you want to wallow in self pity inside your home for the rest of your life, or do you want to look back in a year after you've made multiple positive steps towards a much happier, more ""normal"" life? You're clearly deeply unhappy right now, but it doesn't have to always be this way. Things aren't as impossible as they seem when you're depressed. You've already taken the first big step by saving a lot of money and getting out of there.
