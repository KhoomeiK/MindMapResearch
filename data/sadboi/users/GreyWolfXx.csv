TalesFromTheCustomer,fooi754,t1_foobcqk,1587939450.0,"A lot of people seem to be giving you grief, the employee definitely could have handled it better. It's also disappointing to spend that time and energy bothering to go somewhere -- your favorite buffet -- to get nothing in return. 

Sure, there's explanations about why such a mistake was made. An innocent mistake in general (besides hanging up), a global pandemic, stress -- but your feelings are valid."

Self awareness is the start so you made a great first step by recognizing this in yourself!"

CasualConversation,fikbbtw,t3_f8acof,1582477022.0,"I find that in order to find true friends there are two factors: luck and self-love. If you like yourself, and are genuinely looking to be a good friend to someone as well, it is a lot easier to find new people. 

Being happy alone was a big step for me to feel comfortable with new friends. Once I liked myself, it was easier to be a part of things or conversations. It's a push and pull but overall I am feeling more self-love and self-confidence. It made a world of difference socially for me.

The other part is luck, like some other replies have said. You can increase those odds by putting yourself out there and going to groups or clubs. Hobbies. Statistically it makes things easier and you can find someone who cares about the same things you do.

Finding true friends is possible even if it's lonely and tough right now"

Hopeless, anxiety, and panic attacks can induce DP. Panic attacks in particular, the feeling of being out of yourself, or overwhelmed. For me, DP comes from extreme anxiety and isolation. After working on reintergrating into society after a depression. And after reducing my anxiety, I feel more connected to myself and real."

13ReasonsWhy,ev69ki7,t1_ev4y5uv,1564244196.0,"Honestly, the reason they censored it was because it didn't follow mental health procedure about the topic of suicide. There's a lot of videos on YouTube about how scenes like this in 13RW are triggering and possibly encouraging. 

I actually thought the scene was very powerful and raw. For me personally, it made me want to kill myself less because of how shocking and sad it was to see her parents find her. But I can see how the entire scene could be problematic for others."
askscience,etsyqy0,t1_etsvf62,1563159302.0,I believe HPPD is caused by frequent use or high dosages. It doesn't as commonly occur with lower doses and infrequent usage.

bipolar,eqej6pw,t3_by2t74,1560004639.0,"When you dont recognize yourself or your hands that is dissociation, more specifically depersonalization.

I think perhaps you could call this a dissociative episode? Oftentimes people say its a protective mechanism."

But now I won't touch them with a ten foot pole. Seizures, death, psychosis, fugue state. It's just not worth it.
Lithium and lexapro both act on serotonin -- so does LSD. It is a shame we can't do it, but alas I know it is best.

High edible doses of cannabis put me into a vulnerable state where I can learn about myself and feel differently about life. That's what I do now.

Edit: I'm on Lithium and Wellbutrin, very similar to you"
