I would be more than happy to message you my doctor. She was the first one to take me serious and she was 100% dedicated to finding out what it is. She was my doc who actually ordered all my testings. She is from Canada and did her training in Canada but is now located in Louisiana. Really, she is amazing if you want to try her out. One of the biggest things I cam point out about here is that she believed me when I said it feels like my body is telling me something isn't right and she told me that is a good cue for the doctor to listen to their patients. Best of luck to you. I wish you didn't have to go through this."

You might have to go through the court. Depends on where you are at. 

On a side note though, really accepting that he is making his choice to be with you is his decision is key. I struggled with this a lot with my current husband (now). I thought he was missing out too. But he told me that it is his choice on who he loves and that is 100% right. The only way you need to end your relationship is being YOU dont want to be apart of it. Dont throw away a good relationship because of insecurities because I promise you will regret it. Sorry if my first comment was a little rude!!
