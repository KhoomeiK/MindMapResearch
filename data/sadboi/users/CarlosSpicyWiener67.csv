Now, you can agree or disagree with them being banned, but it falls into the wider aspect of Germany trying to stomp out German Fascism and Nazism, which was a terrible time in German history, it’s understandable why they want to stay away from it. They were also, and I quote from the article you linked: “armed and considered extremely dangerous”.

>you can find thousands of these examples across Europe

Most of these people that had been raided upon were right wing, but I quote from the NYT article you linked: the raids also targeted two people accused of left-wing extremist content

So it’s not just the Far Right that we’re attempting to spread fear and hate. Political Extremism is bad on both ends, but I don’t want to drift off into another subject.

Now, with the Holocaust Denial Law. It’s a very slippery slope, because I would argue that it is sensible to outlaw the denial due to Germany wanting to shed its Nazi past and not cause emotional distress to the actual families of the Holocaust’s 11 million victims. 

On the other hand, free speech comes into play, I get that people like freedom of speech, but that doesn’t mean freedom from consequence. say you shout fire in a crowded theatre, yes it’s protected under freedom of speech, but you do it just to cause panic. That’s what deniers are doing"
