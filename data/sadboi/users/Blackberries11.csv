TEFL,fr3mkdt,t1_fr3i2wa,1589860758.0,Would you mind sharing some of your topics?
Professors,fr3ajff,t1_fr2l9aa,1589853282.0,"No I would just be afraid they wouldn’t laugh.  I feel like I’ve seen posts on here where people tried to use memes and the students didn’t think it was funny.  Also, I teach English language learners and they never understand jokes so it’s just awkward."
TEFL,fr391xi,t1_fr1uote,1589852414.0,Do you read their writing?
EnglishLearning,fr38o96,t1_fr17e9l,1589852195.0,/ ^ / is the stressed version of the schwa. It’s the same sound except it is always stressed and the schwa is always unstressed.
TheWayWeWere,fr3307b,t1_fr2cizj,1589848913.0,What made it disappear after 1920?
Professors,fr2av20,t3_glvb1w,1589834122.0,"I recommend not trying to use memes. Too many stories of profs trying that and it not landing.

Edit- wow I am in the minority on this! Maybe it’s fine?"
Professors,fqzzozf,t1_fqzrtxm,1589779571.0,"In my opinion, very good - some mistakes, outstanding - no mistakes. But, those students sound insufferable."
Professors,fqzy1u0,t1_fqzwbg8,1589778310.0,Mine either. I am about to start a summer session and idk if I can take it. Spring exhausted me.
TrueBackrooms,fqwelz7,t1_fqkbyh7,1589701671.0,Still looks creepy though.

Professors,fqufbac,t1_fqta9qk,1589657921.0,"I got confused by this when looking at full time positions. It looked like the employee still had to pay a lot for the insurance, much more than I currently pay with the health insurance marketplace. It made me wonder if it’s really worth it? I mean, most people seem to think so  so maybe I’m missing something?"
Professors,fqu9b3i,t1_fqtaml4,1589654531.0,Yeah i understand that. I’m an adjunct. I was just not sure what you meant by “lost.”
Professors,fqspd6e,t1_fqry5sr,1589614209.0,That is the worst. I had a similar situation. The way to catch them would be to schedule a meeting with them and get them to explain the work. The person I had failed anyway because he had such bad grades from the beginning of the semester.
Professors,fqsp50n,t1_fqs2dnc,1589613995.0,On blackboard it’s called “question pools.” I think canvas probably has something similar.
Professors,fqsp393,t1_fqs7axf,1589613948.0,That’s bizarre. There shouldn’t be any duplicate questions. I’m not sure what your prof did but that’s not something that normally happens.
Professors,fqsmiyc,t1_fqsizbc,1589611615.0,That’s interesting. I wasn’t sure if they did or not. And yeah that is a LOT of adjuncts.
Professors,fqshgct,t1_fqsfy7i,1589607381.0,"That’s wild, I had no idea. I knew people watched video games on twitch but not to that extent and with teams and everything. And yeah I have no clue what an esports manager would do. Maybe they set up the matches and find endorsement deals and stuff? Or like, they could recruit players."

Professors,fqseyj3,t1_fqsbb7l,1589605460.0,Any time you’re working as an adjunct you are screwed the entire time.  You never know if you’re going to have classes or if they’ll be canceled at the last minute. You have no job security.  In my experience it is quite easy to pick up adjunct jobs though. My department is still using all of its adjuncts.
Professors,fqseoii,t1_fqrt7xl,1589605252.0,For real. Adjuncts are the ultimate exploitable labor. Colleges want that. Adjuncts are like the gig workers of colleges. Also $70k is way way more than the full time positions I had looked at.
Professors,fqseif3,t1_fqrqt6j,1589605128.0,Did you guys lose the adjunct faculty because they got fired?
Professors,fqsdsa3,t1_fqsavw2,1589604592.0,Yeah I teach esl. It’s just a weird confusing set of acronyms
Professors,fqsdl3c,t1_fqscjuh,1589604447.0,"Oh i see. So it’s competitive video games. Do people watch it the same way as they watch football and stuff?  

I feel like colleges just really like esports.  It’s like their new buzzword.  Also, we have a degree that’s literally just “sports venue management.” I feel like that is also extremely specific."
Professors,fqsacdc,t3_gkmwgg,1589602142.0,"My school built some kind of really expensive esports facility.  I have to say, I still don’t understand what esports even is.  Is it...video games?"
Professors,fqsa6zl,t3_gkmwgg,1589602041.0,A BS in law isn’t even a thing in the US. What are they going to do with that?
Professors,fqs8uwf,t1_fqrqsm4,1589601145.0,I don’t even know how they would possibly know about spring 2021.  The students haven’t enrolled yet. What if they don’t enroll and the sections are canceled?
Professors,fqs8jim,t1_fqs5jqv,1589600937.0,One guess is that they like to screw people over at every opportunity to save money.
Teachers,fqs83bk,t1_fqrxeab,1589600651.0,I still think all of those kids deserve their c. Just because kids make grades for different reasons doesn’t mean we should throw out grades.

Professors,fqriflq,t1_fqq2s95,1589584988.0,Some places call it this so the older faculty don’t have to do online. They can mail stuff or whatever.
Professors,fqrei5d,t1_fqqj60a,1589582780.0,It’s probably much cheaper to pay for adjuncts.
EnglishLearning,fqrd1x7,t1_fqq0efw,1589581977.0,That’s what I was going to say: 1st one = British and 2nd one = American

Shake it up, spray all over the shower. Let it sit for about half an hour and the gunk should wipe off with a wet sponge. This works best for soap scum mixed with dirt."

Professors,fqnwj10,t3_gjod6q,1589502802.0,It should be about whether they’re ready for the next level or if you think they need to take the class again.
Professors,fqmry9q,t1_fqmkmju,1589482528.0,"This experience has really exposed how much admin does not care about student learning or the value of the education we are offering.  I had something like this happen too. I’m paranoid about giving too many details and somehow getting identified/in trouble at work, but it was truly egregious and crazy. Made me wonder what the actual point of even grading anything is."

declutter,fqitgpb,t1_fqirdoh,1589400660.0,We live in a very small apartment and part of what we did was just box up stuff we weren’t using and put it in the attic. There was so much stuff that we couldn’t even start decluttering because it felt too overwhelming. Now that there’s less stuff out it’s easier to start getting rid of things.
declutter,fqioe70,t1_fqi3vul,1589398701.0,Weird! Kind of like MS teams maybe.  I’ll prob have to go on one to fully understand this

declutter,fqg0sbt,t1_fqfb2hl,1589335562.0,"We’re both girls! She has no idea what most of the stuff is either lol. I feel like this is the kind of clutter that happens when you buy something for a very specific purpose and then never need it again, and forget what it even is.

declutter,fqf8gau,t1_fqf4rxl,1589320466.0,"Right, I don’t feel like weird mysterious unidentifiable hardware is worth keeping, I mean I don’t even know what it is. I feel like screws and nails, actual tools, and other basic stuff are worth keeping. I am somewhat tool illiterate so I’m not totally sure how to clear out this stuff.
