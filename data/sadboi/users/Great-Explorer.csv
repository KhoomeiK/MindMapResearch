HealthAnxiety,fe3mnya,t1_fe3kus3,1578850693.0,I have an appointment with my dermatologist this Thursday and maybe some blood work with my primary care doctor also. I asked that he remove the mass under my arm (also a Nevi on my back but that‚Äôs a different story). I don‚Äôt want him to ask me ‚Äúdo you have any history of colon/rectal cancer or any dental abnormalities in your family? Because these things can be linked to a syndrome called Gardeners and I would advise you get more testing done.‚Äù
