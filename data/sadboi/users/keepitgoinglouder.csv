Don't be hard on yourself, you'll never fit the mold of your extroverted friends, but that doesn't mean you won't succeed in the real world. There are a lot of good things about being an introvert. You can still be social in your own way, and have a tight knit group of friends, but you don't need to be a social butterfly like your other friends.
