FL_Studio,fq627q2,t3_gh0ihd,1589122956.0,"Hmm maybe wait for AMD to come out with their next generation of cpu later this year? Theyâ€™re updating their chip so any current or older motherboard will not be compatible at all! But AMD has been kicking ass recently so might be worth the wait. 
As a baseline though, consider a PC with at least an intel i5-8400 and 8 gb of ram?
My current build is i5-8400 intel cpu + 16gb of ram + gtx 1050ti
Also just make sure you take advantage of an SSD with their superior read and write speeds
