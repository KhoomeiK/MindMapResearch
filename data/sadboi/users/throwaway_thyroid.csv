I mean, that might actually be the case for a lot of people. But this is a weird rule when it comes to the exemptions. Along with single-family homes, duplexes, and triplexes:

>It also won’t apply to property owners who rent their homes when they are on sabbatical or if they are renting a room in the property they live in.

I get that they don't want to scare off small-time landlords, but they're kind of saying that landlords don't have to put themselves or a small number of tenants at risk, but do have to put a larger number of tenants at risk.* Maybe the reasoning is that a building with 4+ units will have more resources to evict if a tenant becomes a problem? 

There's also an exemption for HUD-funded housing, because of a federal regulation that you can't live on fed property if you've previously cooked meth on assisted housing. Obviously, that's because Berkeley can't overrule federal law, but it's a weird setup where some landlords can check if a potential tenant has a history of cooking meth at home, which is a huge safety issue, and others can't. 

*To be fair, I don't know what the risk is. Everyone needs somewhere to live, and a criminal record can be for something minor. On the other hand, there are a lot of terrible things someone can do that won't get them on the lifetime sex offenders registry, which is the only thing pertaining to crime landlords can now check."
