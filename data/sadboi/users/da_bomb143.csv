bipolar,fim830k,t3_f8m39h,1582520929.0,"there's no real easy answer, it can be hard to say 'what's real and what's my disorder' but you gotta remember that it's all valid - you're ultimately feeling the emotion regardless where it came from. It will get better - you'll work on a treatment plan and medication regimen that helps you feel stable and as time goes on you'll get more and more sure of yourself again. Ngl, it takes time and there will be stumbling blocks along the way, but it will get better <3 <3"

we're going to be tapering off a bunch of these though !! Goal at the mo is to get me down to pretty much just lithium. Slowly but surely~

My biggest complaint right now is that paliperidone is a fuck to cut into quarters, theres no way im getting the exact same dose every day heh"
