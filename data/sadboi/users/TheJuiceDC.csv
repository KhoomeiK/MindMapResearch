I'm Major Depressive disorder with psychosis. I don't have a schizophrenia diagnosis and don't hear voices or experience hallucinations, but I've been hospitalized three times in the past 5 months and have the occasional bout of psychosis. My most recent psychosis was that I was a spy decoding messages (almost similar to A Beautiful Mind) so while I can't 100% relate to everyone in this subreddit; I've found it a lot more helpful and relatable than a lot of the depression ones on  Reddit.

Part of the issue I experienced in the hospital was being super paranoid. For perspective, I live in Washington, DC and work in a politically adjacent field. I focus a lot on Middle Eastern and Russian politics in my studies. I'm also a black belt.

Basically, I show up to the hospital seven days sleep deprived; and I'm convinced there's a conspiracy to kill me by some of the other patients (those of you who have been in a treatment center know what I'm talking about...it's an eclecctic bunch of people). I got so wound up being afraid of being attacked by other patients...I turned my room in the hospital to a giant inflammable beast.

It's been tough trying to explain to my doctors and parents and ESPECIALLY social workers (who seem to be used to working with the mentally impaired). For instance they asked me ""do you have thoughts to hurt anyone else?"" and I'm being asked this the day after a massive fight broke out that the skinny female nurses couldn't break up that resulted in broken bones...so I reply ""in self defense"". This is what I hate about mental hospitals..they'll put me (rape victim) in a room with a criminal waiting trial. That dude will try to start shit, and I try to deescalte or tell the nurses to no avail.

But I'm afraid that if someone like that stirkes me I'm fucked because if I hit him back I get labeled part of the problem. 

If they want people like us to heal, they need to stop treating mental hosptials like holding cells for prisoners and need to stop sending schizophreniacs to prison"
