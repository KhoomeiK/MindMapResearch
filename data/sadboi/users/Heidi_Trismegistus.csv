IAmA,fmdq3wz,t3_fu9ywy,1585974547.0,"I have been dealing with anxiety, depression, and ptsd for over 10 years. I have been suicidal in the past, but since achieving my goal of becoming a special education teacher, I feel I have purpose. I've been through a handful of traumatic experiences. Despite all of my hardships, I am managing and lead a successful life. 

The high anxiety, feelings of hopelessness and exhaustion from all of this are feelings I am quite familiar with. I know how to manage my emotions and feelings at this point in my life. I worry about others who don't manage as well and others who have not had mental health issues in the past but who are experiencing it now...how terrifying it must be.

I have been very worried about how this will affect suicide rates. I wish I could share my personal stories with people and how I overcame all of my traumas and how I ended up ok. Unfortunately, mental health is not yet to the point of destigmatization where it would be ok for a teacher to do so. I want people to know that their feelings are valid. I want them to know that while they might need to be alone for some time, they don't need to feel alone. I so badly want to help with the mental health side of all this, but I don't know how. Do you have any ideas?"
