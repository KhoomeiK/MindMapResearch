Middle child-Care literally cannot do anything about this. So she needs to figure out what about being the middle child is so problematic for her and go from there.

Getting kicked out-Of where? What's the reason? There are 2 sides to every story. If she needs a safe space and you are willing to be a neutral sounding board maybe you can help her.

No. So I've been silently protesting (which he is probably oblivious to) and this morning when I got home from work I lost it.

The living room was (my version) of trashed. Cups, fast food bags, empty ice cream container, dishes lying around and the sink still full with a (clean for 4 days) unemptied dishwasher üòî

My advice is that you should go, but only when you feel comfortable. I was lucky enough to find a meeting in a building that I was familiar with, therefore my comfort level was increased."
