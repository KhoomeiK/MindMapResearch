Same! Idk how I’m going to make it through college (I’ll be transferring to a school away from home). It’s so bad now. I feel like I might have acid reflux, pcos (which causes me to think I have diabetes), etc. Now I’ve been taking tums and allergy medicine to combat my hives. I know I need to seek a doctor but I’m so scared. I also need bloodwork. Again, scared. Terrible fear of dentists/dental work, only getting worse. Idk what to do. No one takes me seriously, except my mom. As she has similar health anxiety. I’m also triggered by anything heart related. Feels like I just can’t win this battle. I know I’m young, and I can turn my health around (as far as eating right and exercising), but when workouts cause pain, I stop because god I have the world’s worst pain tolerance. Couldn’t even sit thru a allergy test without flinching."
TransferStudents,fnxogst,t3_g4iqty,1587342958.0,"Best way is through email now. Most professors get emails regarding letters of rec from students all the time. The worst they can say is no, and if they say no, move onto the next. Also try your advisor. Make sure there is a reasonable explanation for transferring (or at least make it look good)."

Essentially I only read the textbook in depth for my harder classes (business law), I do a outline of each section and little section. I just power through it and considering I get half a chapter done in a day it takes me roughly three days to finish one chapter. 

My other classes don’t require a textbook or I just copy the textbook outline (for my marketing class). For the classes that I skim the textbook/dont read I just try and pay extra attention + detailed notes in class!"

Thanks for the response!!"
