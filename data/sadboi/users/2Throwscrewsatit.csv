What we saw in NY is that when tests are >30% positive then it’s out of control.

Now up to now we’ve been talking about tests as if they functional told you that you have Active virus.

There’s another type of testing that checks for your response to exposure to the virus: antibody or antigen testing. This is a blood test (like the Epstein-Barr virus test for mononucleosis) and it’ll tell people if they were already infected. It won’t say if they’ve recovered but it will allow people to know that they likely had it and survived.
