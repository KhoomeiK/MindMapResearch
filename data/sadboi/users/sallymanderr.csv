AmItheAsshole,fqyv0ne,t3_glbeay,1589755022.0,"OP, you’re NTA for not wanting to include her right now, but you need to work to reframe her behavior here. She isn’t an adult. The things you call abhorrent and disgusting are, frankly, developmentally normal. Challenging, yes, but she’s still a kid, dude. Her brain isn’t fully formed. She’s going through a traumatic time with the pandemic (as are you), probably in pain (growing hurts and a lot of the changes of puberty just suck), and like all teens, she’s dealing with all kinds of hormones. Teens test boundaries like toddlers. It is such a tough phase. Not only that, but during times of high stress, regression and acting out are SO common. But a “firm hand” often goes the wrong way with both groups - it helps more to set clear boundaries and focus on the positive, hype it up even if it feels almost impossible to find. Specific and timely praise, you know? Again, you are not TA for deciding you can’t deal with this behavior in your project right now. But I think you might want to check in with yourself about your expectations of your child and how clear and realistic they are at her developmental stage and under the current, remarkably stressful circumstances."

Regarding moving internationally with your child, he would need permission for that whether you are married or divorced. Parents have been held up before while traveling with kids with the full knowledge and consent of their spouses/co-parents because they failed to bring appropriate documentation with them for their trips.

The least sugary meal replacement shake I can get + really green smoothies work best for me. Nut butters are good to pop into a smoothie for fat and calories. Chia pudding is also on the easier side for me to get down. Keeping little calorie-dense snacks like nuts or power balls on hand and just choking down a little at a time all day helps. Fresh fruit is also on the easier side to eat. Asian pears are very nice for this, light and crisp and watery. For me, it passes eventually or at least I become more able to eat after a period of choking food down that I don’t really want to eat, but if I let the lack of appetite totally dictate my intake, it all lasts longer.

ABraThatFits,fdhz7jq,t3_elgbfo,1578432849.0,"Something to maybe consider here is that the issues you were complaining about DO affect bra shopping/sizing/recommendations and your size is really only one part of a big equation. A woman who has shrunk down and now has loose skin on her breasts and soft tissue and feels bad about that has different bra needs than a woman who has breasts that are shallow with firm tissue and is pretty happy with their appearance, even if they are both 30DD. Pain, discomfort, psychological distress, there is a LOT tied up in bra fitting. A woman’s particular insecurities around her breasts matter for bra fitting. Would she like to appear larger? Smaller? Perkier? Does she have scars, pain, sensitive skin? Is she so down on herself she can’t feasibly shop and try things on in person? Different needs require different solutions.

In the name of self care, it might be healthier to avoid subs that talk about things that tie into your dysmorphia rather than asking people to omit relevant details or edit their feelings for your own comfort.

ptsd,fd6150y,t1_fd5yly1,1578184079.0,"OP, the tough love approach people usually suggest in these situations is (as you may already know from your own experience) not often actually helpful/may be isolating and detrimental to people still caught in that cycle of abuse, BUT you can still set healthy boundaries for yourself. If your friend knows about your trauma history, even just broad strokes, she should be able to understand why some things are going to go off limits as topics of conversation with you. Just staying in her life as a friend without doing the whole “me or him” thing is a good source of support, because it keeps her connected when her abuser benefits from her being isolated. If you feel like you want to do more than that, you can still (if you feel comfortable doing this) safety plan with her, keep a go bag for her, refer her to resources, agree to be the person she calls “for pizza” when/if she needs someone to call the police for her etc. Again, you don’t need to do any of that if it’s too much for you or if you don’t think she’s yet in a place where she’ll be receptive to it. Just staying in her life as a friend who talks with her about work/movies/food/whatever non-boyfriend stuff your friendship used to be about helps a lot. Just remember that realizing you’re in a dangerous relationship and being ready/able to leave are separate stages that take time for most people to arrive at, even if some people do come to them all at once and leave in an instant. And maybe she’ll be in a bad place when you have that boundary setting talk and lash out at you, so plan for your own emotional safety as well and what you’ll do afterwards if the talk doesn’t go swimmingly."
