BPD,fp2x90d,t1_fp2twsi,1588269411.0,I appreciate the validation and attention.
BPD,fp2ktt8,t1_fp1pdo2,1588263479.0,"Yes, but it describes ""act in"" versus ""act out"". We react to trauma with shame in act in, or anger with act out. For me, quiet BPD, is what made the diagnosis make more sense and able to see the anger subjectivity that seems more common and how my neuropathways fit the description even if my behavior doesn't seem typical. It seems useful to know. Besides the diagnostics in the DSM-5 haven't adapted to newer ideas and recommendations about BPD perhaps due to medical interest in keeping treatment cheaper or insufficient for insurance or medical profit."
BPDrecovery,fljdiga,t1_flj3sp0,1585207939.0,"Its one of the four skills taught in Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, and is a program of cognitive behavioral training that was created for treatment of BPD. Gradually increasing tolerence of pain, discomfort, or
 anger."
BPDrecovery,flgz1kl,t3_fop0vd,1585153037.0,"Bpd has its spectrum but nothing you describe sounds mild. Building awareness and analyzing how you talk to yourself and others is difficult, especially when living within the world of BPD. I would suggest finding an effective way or teach you distress tolerence, and the other life skills which  can help us rebuild ourselves. I'm sure with the right environment and nurturing your goals can still be obtained. Good Luck!"
BPD,fkf9n7w,t1_fkee7g8,1584129764.0,I went through a dbt progam and because weed was not negatively effecting my life they didnt make me stop for therapy. It was nice not have to choose skills over a good distress tolerence tool.
BPD,fkdgjxn,t1_fkcxg2g,1584077973.0,It does indeed travel in that direction of generality.
BPD,fijc82t,t3_f83a5q,1582441702.0,I know that feeling. That gnawing emptiness. Its hard to stay in ourselves with that pain.
BPD,fijbzgs,t3_f7zpxd,1582441422.0,I feel that. Recovery doesnt seems likely.

I'm an art type person living in a kind of existential nightmare of my own creating. I've been doing the college thing aimlessly for the last 20 years or so and I've got lots of fun and exciting ways of trying not to feel worthless. I've been in therapy for the last 6 years and kind of on this quest to be more authentic to my kind, bumbling ways. One of those ways involves ruthlessly finding the best answer to questions of why are things like this.  I'm big into reality acceptance and am so insecure I love constant communication around attachment and other things. I have dissassociation and derealization and one of my favorite things is to have people to talk to so I can confirm my existence and if what I am perceiving is real or my own imagination. I'm 41 \[m\] and in Oregon so at a good range for discording stuff I don't really have any hopes or expectations but I'd be happy to nerd out over hobbies and such if another voice who knows what the demons of anxiety, anger, and shame feel like is valuable in some way, happy to be useful.. I'm can get reasonably excited and validating about most topics with nuance or craft.  ENTJ. Nerd cred: I've worked at 2 comic book shops, and run lighting for a japanese animation convention, I have a mental health podcast that I'm writing and having fun with based on DBT."

NarcissisticAbuse,f0w743d,t3_d6t7hi,1569000518.0,"Cognitive Behavioral Training for the trauma you went through along with the codependency the relationship fostered. Think of it as brainwashing, you need to have an outside perspective to check facts with. Mindfulness to current emotion and exploring rather than ignoring the hurt and pain."

dbtselfhelp,eu82tev,t3_cf36uo,1563548499.0,"I don't think DBT purpose is to give you a life worth living. It's purpose is to stabilize us enough so that we can figure out what that means and how to achieve it. DBT is not a solution or the final step in a mental health journey. It's extremely powerful set of skills and training that is meant to reconnect our emotional experience to our bodies and minds in an effective way. Using effective mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation and interpersonal skills can improve our daily experience but it's not going assign meaning and worth to what we do.  

The most useful thing I found in DBT was how my own language and self talk was hurting me. My parent's and peers choices on how I was taught to view myself was causing ever increasing amounts of damage to my self worth, and I started a cycle of not feeling worthy of self care. 

Awareness of the self and realizing how bound I am by shame, has made attacking the life worth living goals seem possible. Still working towards it, but it's possible. It might be helpful to bring awareness on how you talk to yourself."
BPDrecovery,eteoki8,t1_etdayvk,1562740084.0,"It was therapy changing what I could tolerate. When I publicly started to explore and process my abuse she couldn't tolerate the recognition that mothers can be abusive and that I specifically was a victim. I started to call her out for emotional abuse and challenging what I thought was unfair. It was not something that she was able to explore or tolerate me healing from. She cut me off from all forms of intimacy while I was going through pretty intensive DBT and CPT. She insisted because I was sick with BPD I was the cause of our relationship ending. I used to accept more blame than I do now. 

I don't know. I think we grew apart. She wanted me to earn back holding her hand when I asked to be comforted while confronting a traumatic life of physical sexual and emotional abuse. If I had a problem with something mean, she would flip the tables, overwhelm my empathy with transgressions sometimes done in her dreams, and act as if her jabs were harmless jokes. I'm pretty broken from the 19 years we spent together."

ADHD,epunpz5,t3_bvyfo4,1559512568.0,"Anecdotally, as a middle class white kid, struggling with college and university for 20 years off and on after high school,  I wasn't diagnosed until 40, last October. Meds & DBT have been a game changer for me. When I was growing up in the 80s my parents said ADHD didn't exist, my step mom was a nurse. She said kids like that should just be made to go outside. I was outdoors a lot. But I had a pretty horribly abusive non-typical childhood."

BPD4BPD,ep5fa07,t3_btnihm,1559055064.0,"I think it's more likely that your mom has NPD. Kind of classic for us BPD kids.  I think that FP bond is a corruption of the self. Locking on to an FP is a desperate act to find some kind of authority to bring us meaning. Mothers who don't nurture, corrupt a childs mind in ways that make their sense of self  weak and seeking constant assurance from outside themselves. It's another way to try and process the pain from insecure parenting. Have some self compassion for your own experience, which is damn hard for abuse victim. I think your mom is full of it and want's more attention from you."
