PlasticSurgery,fqsakps,t3_gko0pl,1589602303.0,I honestly think it‚Äôs a great look. People get chin filler for that kind of strong jawline. You‚Äôre beautiful!
AmItheAsshole,fq39ife,t1_fq3340x,1589064261.0,":) sure thing! Sounds like he loves you and since you were so excited about the engagement, ring aside, you have something good!"
AmItheAsshole,fq2kx62,t3_ggmie8,1589057139.0,"YTA - not for disliking the ring but for the way you brought it up and insulted his taste. He probably got hyped up by friends/ family who have that type of taste and thought you‚Äôd love it too.
If his family is very wealthy and $10k isn‚Äôt that big a deal, you could have kept the ring and said you don‚Äôt feel comfortable wearing it daily as it is so valuable and also does not suit your every day style, and compromised to wear a simple silver band, without hurting his feelings."
PlasticSurgery,fpq7bju,t3_gen3z1,1588816617.0,"Looks great! Also sort of makes you look younger, in a good way!"

natureismetal,fpds92b,t3_gcm2i8,1588533192.0,They could be completely and utterly dead and I still would not put them in my hand like that
BPD,foowmrr,t3_g8jvs5,1587948024.0,Thanks for making this post!
PlasticSurgery,fnt5pzs,t3_g3rlko,1587235121.0,"If you want to test it out in a less expensive / temporary way, I recommend talking to a doctor about filler. If you really love the look you can keep doing the injections every year or so, or if you like the look but want more of a result go for a surgical consultation. If you don‚Äôt like it, it‚Äôll fade! (I think you can also have it dissolved)"
AskReddit,fnr5c2g,t3_g3a9tc,1587179670.0,AITA
PlasticSurgery,fnr1aud,t3_g3cnjk,1587176912.0,I really like it if it‚Äôs subtly done. I think Bella Hadid went a little far for example.
PlasticSurgery,fmitl0i,t3_fvhtdw,1586116644.0,Love them! I hate that lip filler gets such a bad rep because of the crazy insta models that over do them. They can compliment the face so nicely when done well.
PlasticSurgery,flt06c9,t3_fqysh6,1585455411.0,"I would say lip filler and cheek filler. Cheek filler can also kinda push the outer eyes up, giving the cat eye look she seems to have now."
PlasticSurgery,fky3g6x,t3_flcch7,1584640655.0,So good and looks really natural!!!
BPDmemes,fkelwtv,t3_fhxxma,1584115892.0,"Omg seriously though! Sometimes when I get home after being at work all day, or with my friends, and then I‚Äôm alone at home and I get a pit in my stomach, and it so clearly crosses my mind ‚Äúhere we go again‚Äù"

PlasticSurgery,fkef52s,t3_fhx7yh,1584111885.0,"Looks great already, so I can‚Äôt imagine how amazing it will look like after a few months! He did a great job and it‚Äôs really natural!"
BPDmemes,fkb21em,t1_fk9iox4,1584024511.0,Hahaha I didn‚Äôt even notice
BPD,fk9ijgp,t1_fk9fr85,1583976768.0,"Wish you well in your recovery, thanks for your input!"
BPD,fk88iut,t1_fk87x54,1583951364.0,"Yeah, the cons are atrocious. Sometimes (probably very stupidly) i just get weird satisfaction from being dark and twisted and mysterious to other people. I seriously get so much attention and I think it‚Äôs people picking up on that. But even that isn‚Äôt close to worth the cons. I agree with you on this one. Thanks for the input. I‚Äôm curious if there‚Äôs anyone who would opt to keep it."

PlasticSurgery,fjikvl5,t3_fdhweg,1583369876.0,"Yes this is totally common! I had a septorhino in August and I had major anxiety the first few weeks afterwards, I think mainly because I had just made a permanent change to my face, albeit a good one. A few months later and I love my nose, and barely even think of the fact that I had surgery on it at all. Just feels like mine now, and no more anxiety about it. Chin up!"
PlasticSurgery,fiav62q,t3_f77e6j,1582309009.0,"I‚Äôm less than a year in, so my swelling still varies expectedly. I‚Äôve noticed swelling is worse if I eat a lot of salt or drink a lot the day before."

PlasticSurgery,fg62yq1,t3_ex13r0,1580550874.0,"I think you‚Äôd like chin and lip filler. You don‚Äôt need it, but I think you‚Äôd like it."

PlasticSurgery,fco3spt,t1_fcm2ddq,1577823537.0,That‚Äôs weird I would assume Botox would raise them rather than lower them! Well they look great still
PlasticSurgery,fclf6oi,t3_ehp1bm,1577746386.0,"I love how.. raised? Your eyebrows are naturally! So jealous of that look. Your profile is great too. Not that you NEED any work (totally beautiful) but when I wasn‚Äôt happy with my under eye circles, I wanted under eye filler. I was surprised though, because the doctor recommended a cheek filler instead and it looked INCREDIBLE! i knew the look I wanted but was wrong about how to achieve it. So I think your best bet is go in for a free consultation and get real advice in person! As long as you don‚Äôt go overboard, filler and Botox can be great :) beautiful as it is, though."
addiction,fb9by3n,t3_ec2qur,1576634625.0,Nicorette really helped me quit. It  helps minimize the withdrawal. I highly recommend
cats,fb8qkh6,t3_ec174v,1576619580.0,Aw they are lucky to have you as their owner
antiMLM,fb2mn92,t1_fb2km9u,1576453817.0,I know! I feel so bad for the Hispanic community they took advantage of because they were easy targets trying to achieve the American dream.
antiMLM,fb2mk31,t1_fb2ee0j,1576453770.0,Yeah they mention that too! So crazy. Definitely watch it.
antiMLM,fb2mh51,t1_fb2e8pk,1576453726.0,Yeah but at least he made a hell of a racket about it. Eventually the big wigs did get indicted and had to pay quite a bit. I was really rooting for Ackman though üò©
BPD,fapcqld,t1_fap8etm,1576285615.0,This resonates a lot with me and it does seem like that could definitely be the case. Thanks a lot for your insight.
BPDlovedones,fap4ati,t1_faoy0q7,1576279513.0,I‚Äôm so sorry to hear your experience. It sounds like you did everything in your power and I can imagine that 11 years later you‚Äôd be beyond emotionally drained. You were incredibly patient with her.
BPDlovedones,faomd41,t3_ea7ab2,1576267567.0,"Thanks for the input! I read that it was a big part of the disorder when I started researching more, but just wasn‚Äôt quite sure the purpose"
BPDlovedones,faodton,t1_faobg60,1576262145.0,"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. I agree it‚Äôs so awful to watch someone go through that, and to helplessly witness them destroy themselves and their relationships with people around them. Not be able to help because you‚Äôd be torturing yourself. Such a shame. Thanks for your insight"
BPDlovedones,faodm6x,t1_faoadjf,1576262029.0,Yeah I got the impression that that was the center of all of the issues. If you‚Äôre so detached from yourself I can‚Äôt imagine you can have a healthy attachment with anyone else. Thanks for your input
BPDlovedones,faodii3,t1_faobogc,1576261976.0,Oh interesting. Thank you for typing this out.
