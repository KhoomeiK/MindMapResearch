BipolarReddit,fiwgbox,t3_fa56ed,1582784857.0,"I have been through something similar, many times. I always have to remind myself that, no matter how much you love them, they are in no way obligated to deal with (for lack of a better term) your mental illness. As shitty as it sounds, if they find it is too hard for them to handle, it’s just simply too much for them. It’s nobody’s fault, really. It’s a hard pill to swallow, but as much as they preach about MeNtAL hEaLtH, some people are just not equipped to handle the (sometimes ugly) symptoms of mental illnesses. There are people, though, that no matter how hard things get, will stick by you, and those are the people that matter the most when healing, OP. :)"
BipolarReddit,finsu59,t3_f8t70k,1582569467.0,"I have seen people say it either makes them gain or lose weight. For me, Abilify absolutely killed my appetite. I lost a decent amount of weight in a pretty small span of time, so I had to retrain myself to eat when I wasn’t hungry. Also, for the first couple months, I also had the uneasy feeling you’re explaining. The weird side effects do ease up, though. Best of luck. :)"

raisedbynarcissists,fih1e7s,t3_f7r6cz,1582405483.0,"I got kicked out when I was 17, and I had to learn how to live on my own with no help. I had never had a job, paid bills, I didn’t have any credit. Parents didn’t teach me any helpful life skills - I learned the majority of mine through Google (lol). Getting a car and apartment + learning how to save money was tough, but you learn! 3 years later, I’m still learning, but it has gotten significantly easier! Please, please, do not beat yourself up. Things will get better and you WILL learn how to do life! Keep your head up and keep pushing forward, OP, we are cheering you on! You can do it. :)"

AskWomen,fi98jv2,t3_f723hs,1582258263.0,"My brother (who is 5 years older than me) was always allowed to do anything he wanted, even if our mom had strict set rules. He would never be home by curfew (sometimes he wouldn’t even come home), cursed and screamed at our mom, failed classes, did drugs. I can’t remember a time where he was ever grounded for longer than a day or two. However, my mom wouldn’t even let me leave the house after 8pm, and if I (God forbid) got a ‘B’ in a class, I was grounded for weeks, sometimes months. She had to approve of all the clothes I wore, and I wasn’t “allowed” to date anyone. She loved my brother’s girlfriends, and bonded with all of his friends. Like I said, he could really do anything and get away with it. Her reasoning back then was, “because he’s a boy and they’ll always get away with more.” It was annoying growing up, but weirdly enough, I’m closer to my mom than my brother is now, as adults. Strange how that works."

I also frequently vomit from my migraines - is topiramate just something that’s prescribed? I haven’t even heard of it, I’m very open to trying new medications. Anything so I can function regularly again, haha"
raisedbynarcissists,fi8uldi,t3_f71j3j,1582248708.0,"My Ndad would constantly belittle me and make fun of me if I was having any kind of fun - so, I understand how this feels. I have found that it helps me immensely to surround myself with supportive people, and always remember that you are MORE than allowed to have fun and enjoy the life you have. Little by little it will feel more comfortable. Things will get better, keep your head up!"

Naturally, people are going to stare. I think that’s one of the parts that seems most empowering to me, that I’ll stick out and will just grow accustomed to people looking at me, and I won’t feel the need to hide behind something as insignificant as hair anymore. I have spent way too much time worrying what others think. Hair grows back, and as lame as it sounds, I’ll grow with it! :)"

I think my brain is just so accustomed to the idea that staying complacent is significantly less scary than confrontation. It makes me feel better to hear it gets better, so thank you. Sometimes hard to remember that."
