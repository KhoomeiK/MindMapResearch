Anxiety,fq9ahd0,t3_ghdulv,1589191497.0,"My youngest is a month old and I get tense every time I walk through a doorway holding her. I don't remember if it was as persistent with my other kids when they were infants. I do still often get a similar anxiety now that they're older, that they're going to get themselves injured rather than my causing it.
I definitely had a stretch a while back where I had that ""I'm going to die while caring for my child and they'll be all alone"" fear frequently. it's mostly gone away though I don't know why. (hmm something to bring up in therapy I guess.)
Basically, know that you're not alone. 
As for what you can do about it--i don't really have any helpful advice. A good therapist and the right medication have done wonders for my anxiety in general."

Eberron,fq81kfw,t1_fq7yt68,1589156623.0,I think modern London is still like that. But to be fair I grew up in NYC so anything that's not a grid system is byzantine AF to me.
Eberron,fq7v61k,t1_fq7ucpf,1589152862.0,"I think an address inside a tower wouldn't even need a street. Giving an address for one of those little shops on a bridge is a bit trickier, though."
Eberron,fq7ulhd,t3_ghb6al,1589152527.0,"This is an example of how I plan on presenting addresses:
Tower A*
Suite 45-9
Platinum Heights
Upper Central
Sharn

*I don't know if individual towers have identifiers but this is one way I figured that could work."

Anxiety,fledllo,t3_fo6h6w,1585082344.0,"I've got the opposite problem. I don't get chest tightness when I'm anxious, but the slight tightness I've started feeling over the past hour has me freaking out. I don't even know if tightness is the right word. It feels like a milder version of when you're out of breath and gulping cold air. 

Someone please tell me I'm overreacting. :("
Eberron,fjnxw45,t1_fjnsdie,1583516528.0,I think this could still be the case for getting to the upper level. It would either cost more and/or have fewer routes than traveling between lower and middle.
dndnext,fjnhce3,t3_fe9rwn,1583507408.0,"I don't think this was a planned thing. I'm a programmer and worked briefly in QA and it's so easy to see how a mistake like this happens. I don't think anyone will get fired, because likely the responsibility is spread out. There may be some probations.

That said, I think this was probably a windfall for DDB.

I ended up spending $35 altogether (I had to use 3 different accounts to get the stuff I most wanted), which is definitely more than I would have spent on all of this stuff. I own a hardcopy of XGE so I never would have justified spending $30 for that content on DDB. I also have an excellent local library system so I can request almost all the 5e books. And since I'm hoping to start DMing in the near future I'm MUCH more likely to rely on DDB now. Which means I'll probably be spending more in the future."

Eberron,fjlwfhx,t1_fjla5h2,1583456030.0,"Exactly. Most of the time that kind of traveling can just get glossed over, but sometimes, especially if a character is new to Sharn, it could be SO fun."
Eberron,fjlwc62,t1_fjllcyo,1583455968.0,"Hmm. What do you roll to see if you can understand the announcements? I'm thinking straight INT check. Advantage if you're a Sharn native, Disadvantage if you're new in town. :)"

Eberron,fiz30ds,t1_fiz21yo,1582852943.0,"Makes sense. 
I think the biggest ""gotcha"" is that the PC better be confident that the artificer isn't going to forget and decide to make another item and inadvertently deactivate the one he gave the PC. And I really like the trope of the scatterbrained inventor..."

DnD,fi44r5h,t3_f5x3ru,1582133952.0,"So, when running a Session 0, would I straight up ask people if they care about their characters having reason/motivation to do things? 
I feel like I'd need a more diplomatic way of asking that so that it doesn't come across as ""are you cool with railroading""?"

DnD,fi1nfhe,t3_f5x3ru,1582061128.0," Thanks all. You've given me a lot to think about. This is certainly turning into a learning experience.

I'm now doing some reading up on how Session 0 works. I don't think any of us were aware that was a thing. Though, at my urging, we did have a preliminary meet-up, partially to discuss character creation, and partially because I wanted to get a sense of the other players since we'd never met (I'm friends-ish with the DM). But the whole thing was pretty disorganized.

Also, sorry if I made it sound like I'd created a totally risk-averse character and general stick-in-the-mud. I think I've been pretty gung-ho so far but am losing momentum without some real character motivation. I'll think of something though."
DnD,fhy3833,t1_fhxf9zs,1581967625.0,"Yeah, I know that the session duration is largely responsible for the slow pace. Though I think we should have been able to cover more ground than we have.

On the other hand, while it's been a very effective anti-depressant for me, I don't think it's done much for my anxiety (but I don't think lexapro did either so that may just be me)."
