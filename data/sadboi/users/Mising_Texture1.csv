I’ve seen a lot of persons call people “snowflakes” for finding certain jokes out of touch or disgusting, i disagree with this statement. The opinions of the spectators are very valid, and if they don’t like it the comedian should get the disapproval of said audience. 

Comedy for me is like cuisine, that being an art in which you’re trying to bring joy to another individual by creating something that they may like. Your vision here is not really the focus, neither it is your ego, in fact, your art is made specifically to make others feel good, and said enjoyment by itself would be the reward."

That state gives you a knowledge, such knowledge by itself is useless.

That’s like if one day god came to you and told you about the birth of the world, unless you had a very deep understanding of all the key elements at hand, that knowledge doesn’t have any value, right?
