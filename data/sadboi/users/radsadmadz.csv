AskReddit,foza6ce,t3_gadfof,1588187249.0,"Hardcore procrastinator here. I learned this method a while ago - if I have something that I need to get done but I just can't seem to bring myself to start, I count to three and when I get to 3 I just do it. It sounds stupid but it works."
ACTrade,fo444ga,t1_fo43qob,1587497870.0,Sure!

AskReddit,fl1wzon,t3_flt20t,1584738053.0,"I know a lot of people have it a lot worse right now, but I was studying abroad in the Galapagos Islands when I got the message that we would have to be emergency evacuated out of the country. This is a trip I have been dreaming about since I was a young teenager, so to say the least I was quite heartbroken when I realized that once in a lifetime experience would have to be cut short."

WhatsWrongWithYourDog,f4pr9pu,t3_dlbjt3,1571741052.0,Oh god. This reminds me of William Wegman's books where he dresses weimaraners up like humans
mycology,f4n1e3m,t3_dl3j33,1571684667.0,This is so beautiful! Love the color contrast
succulents,f3y38ks,t1_f3y17rd,1571247938.0,"I’m also in Oregon so I feel your pain about the lack of sunlight lol. You don’t need a big grow light setup, even just a UV bulb in a desk lamp will do the trick"
succulents,f3xy3c2,t3_dikl3u,1571245717.0,"The one on the right is looking great - it is called an Echeveria Neon Breakers. The one on the left looks like it could use a bit more sun since it is a bit tall and stretched out. Other than that it is looking healthy!

Are there drainage holes in the bottom of the tray you are using? If not I would highly recommend transferring them to a tray with drainage as succulents don't like excess water staying in the soil.

Looks beautiful!"

ZeroWaste,esh2w87,t1_esh0uly,1561980123.0,"Perhaps if it had a more permanent clay lid it might be something that could be reused to store other food products. Or maybe you could use it as a flower pot if you drilled a drainage hole in the bottom. Totally see your point here, but it seems like there are more ways to reuse it than a conventional plastic container."
