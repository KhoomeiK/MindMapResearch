I'm going to wait some days, then put in a large amount.

If long, long term is your strategy, as it probably should, it probably is smart to keep putting in extra if you have it. In the end your just accumulating more shares.

The biggest key is not to sell.

Question: say I decided to ""invest"" $5 today when the markets down. Does that $5 automatically get invested that day? or is it invested once it clears the bank from 1-3 days? Could that $5 I wanted to invest on a down day, actually be invested a few days later on a big up day?"

worldpolitics,fju61n5,t3_fews6v,1583613816.0,"The Democrat party ideals are fractured into two camps, while the Republicans are mostly united despite their erratic president. The Dems will continue to lose unless Bernie's basic policies are pursued. half-assed attempts won't be tolerated. Biden doesn't even want to change the scheduling of cannabis. Even red voters want that. Easy, basic stuff that makes young adults unable to respect him to represent their viewpoints. The only people that don't are 75 and older with closed minds and no life.

Trump is the youngest candidate for president. WTF?!

Old people really shouldn't be running this country, nor should their ideals be pushed to impact younger generations. 

The Dems are fubared. Trump support is bigger than ever Really his support is simply anti-democrat. The impeachment made things worse for the Dems. Moderate and conservative views towards big-city liberals have only gotten nastier. Moderates won't vote for Biden in the prez election despite his primary success with said group. I attempted to sabotage Trump in the GOP primary in 2016, then voted Blue in election. Plenty of people out there sabotaging Bernie because theyre uninformed or will vote Red.

Biden only won the South (states that will surely be red for prez election), bc he was Obama's VP. Name recognition and weaponizing of the word ""Socialism"" is what did it.

Boring Biden is the absolute worst candidate Dems could nominate. Nobody is coming out in Nov. to vote for him. Turnout amongst 18-34 year olds will be very low.

Would ""Biden Centrists"" (conservative liberals) vote for Bernie if he were nominated? Its despicable they even considered Buttige...Mayor Pete. What a joke.

Beyond everything else: Only a handful of counties in a few states actually matter in this presidential election. Trump will very likely win these concentrated hotspots again. What has changed other than dem candidate chaos?
