I’ve never paid for dogs, cats, birds or rats. Getting pets is free here except if you’re getting them from the pet store. 

Unless its like you know a specially bred super special “clean” breed then yes they cost money.

Why would you tell someone to kill themselves. Am i an asshole? Yes i am. Does this mean i need to die? No I don’t think it does, you’re an asshole too cause you’re telling people to kill themselves when they’re trying to have a conversation with you. So i can now say that we’re equally bad.

Also i do hope that you know that telling someone to kill themselves doesn’t really do anything to that person, at least not to me, its not going to change much except making me more wary about people on the spectrum.

Yo i should make a post in this sub asking for help on why i feel these things to see how many people will give me advice and try to understand my behavior and how many people will just tell me to “kill yourself you piece of shit, i hope op goes to a deserted island and die of starvation”.
