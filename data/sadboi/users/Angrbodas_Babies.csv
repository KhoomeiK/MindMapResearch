I'd suggest getting out into the community so you can start to understand how things work. Go to gallery openings and other arts events. Talk to people. Make friends. Then just start doing it.

I don't regret the path I took, but it hasn't been the easiest. If you are capable of making art and being an active member of the arts community with your current job, then hey, that's pretty good. If your current job makes it impossible to do those things, look for a different one."

Fire,fqr1ca5,t3_gk47uz,1589575765.0,"I've been there! About 13 years ago I left my soul crushing corporate job to pursue a career in the arts. Since then I have had my work shown in museums, I have won awards and grants, I have had a fellowship at a nationally recognized museum, and I have had academic papers written on my work. I have founded arts organizations and I have been the director of an international film festival. I am, by all accounts, a very successful artist - and I have never made more than $5000 off of the arts in a single year.

In all likelihood you will always have to have a day job. The most successful artists I know have day jobs in the arts, but they are still day jobs. I have met people who have made a living solely from their art, but they are so few that it isn't even worth mentioning.

Additionally, the arts are fickle and strongly biased towards youth. What's hot now will be worthless next year. Popular artists eventually lose relevance. Every beautiful flower fades and wilts until it becomes compost to feed the next flower.

My current day job pays $10.25/hr and I'm in the process of taking classes and learning skills so I can find another soul crushing corporate job that will feed, house, and allow me to save for a few years while I gear up for the next phase of my career, which will probably also require me to have a day job.

If your current day job is unmanageable, look for something that is manageable. You will always need one. Plan your day jobs in a way that feeds your art career rather than putting off your art career to pursue your day job. Treat your day job as a tool, not a lifestyle."

horror,fo16ng6,t1_fo15c9e,1587426831.0,"Sure!

Here's the section on the stairs scene. This is about sound design:

The main character is Rachel. Her son is Aiden. This scene happens in
Rachel‚Äôs sister‚Äôs house, during the wake for Katie, Rachel‚Äôs niece. Katie‚Äôs room is
upstairs, the mourners are on the first level. Aiden is walking upstairs to go to
Katie‚Äôs room.

The tone is tense and otherworldly. It‚Äôs very creepy. There is no room tone,
which leaves the scene feeling empty. I believe there‚Äôs a very low pitched sine
wave at the bottom which sort of sucks all the wind out of the room without being
very noticeable. On top of that there is a layer of creepy music that‚Äôs less music
than a soundscape. Digital bells ringing, static, electronically generated tones.
There is the sound of highly altered water bubbling that builds up as Aiden
reaches for Katie‚Äôs door handle. The only sound that is related to what is visually
happening in the scene is Aiden‚Äôs footsteps, and they appear to not quite match
up with his steps.

It‚Äôs extremely effective. It creates a very disturbing feeling and makes you
aware of the medium, that you are watching a moving image story about people
who watched a moving image story that led to their deaths. It draws you into the
story by taking you out of it. It is effective and uncomfortable.

And the second section. This is about camera movement:

In this scene Rachel has one day left to live, and has gone to a horse farm
on an island looking for Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan is the father of the spirit who is
causing all the trouble, a young girl named Samara. In the previous scene,
Rachel was on a Ferry to the island and a horse on the ferry panicked and
jumped overboard, dying, and there has been a theme of dead horses
throughout the film, all related to this farm. Being on the horse farm has a
backdrop of tension from the story.

Here, Rachel is walking past empty stables. She approaches a wooden
fence (possibly a gate). The camera movement has been set up for the viewer by
framing the previous scene within the ground level wooden fence.
The camera dollies past a barn or stables. It looks like the other side of the
structure Rachel just walked by. On the other side of the stables is a fenced in
pasture, with Mr. Morgan working on the fence on the other side. As the stables
slip off to the right, Rachel enters in from the lower left corner, but she is smaller
than you would expect. The camera is at a different angle that we were led to
believe.

The dolly past the stables gives the viewer the belief that we are at ground
level, walking past the stables, when it must be the second level of the barn like
structure. This, like the scene of Aiden walking up the stairs, draws the viewer in
by pulling them out. You become aware of the medium in a disorienting way,
which adds tension to a scene that is already creepy and tense."

BipolarReddit,fnd8brc,t3_g0yqh5,1586862565.0,"I spent a number of years in the antipsychiatry rabbit hole. It was the best option available to me at the time. I was always ok with people who chose to be medicated, but was strongly interested in finding a different path for myself. I am currently medicated and I plan on staying that way.

Some people really luck out and get on a med stack that helps them pretty quickly. They may be hospitalized and actually find it useful, if imperfect. For some people it's easy to find a path that feels like progress and wellness. That was not my experience. 

I originally wrote a big section here describing my experiences, but it was turning into a book. I can go into detail if you would like, but suffice it to say that at the time, antipsychiatry was the better choice.

After 20+ years I have finally found a set of meds and a therapist that helps. There are a lot of ideas that I picked up in my years in antipsychiatry that continue to shape my understanding. It's true that I struggle with mental health problems, but I view those struggles through a lens of the social theory of disability. I see my diagnosis as a label for a collection of symptoms rather than a singular disease. I see that the way society reacts to those symptoms works to make those symptoms worse.

I wish that I had been able to find the help I have now 20 years ago, but I didn't. I now firmly believe that medication and therapy can help, and that it does help me. I also believe that the antipsychiatry movement has its place in pushing for better treatment and understanding of mental health issues. I continue to believe that for some people antipsychiatry offers better support than the medicalized system.

My honest response is that if you want antipsychiatry to go away, you have to present a better option."

I don't really hold back on it. If I have even the slightest inkling that it'll help, I take it. I end up taking it much more than I thought I would, but I also have periods where I don't take it at all. It works well for me.

It made a lot more sense knowing that. Digging deeper and deeper into something that leaves you with all these complex and mixed up emotions, with no real sense of closure. 

I was a huge POE fan at the time, and had picked up the new album and HOL at the same time, having no idea what the relationship was. I was so completely shocked.

AskReddit,fl2vyut,t1_fl1odwu,1584761350.0,"Around 10 years ago I quit a lucrative job to become my sister's caretaker. It pays $10.25/hr. I love her and I am glad that because of me she can live a happy life.

It has ruined me financially. It has destroyed my resume. Someday she will end up in a home and I will be truly screwed. It's a horrible industry.

I tried to quit once, to salvage my life. Her new caretakers left her alone in bed for 3 days. I had to come back. 

Getting sick in the United States ruins whole families. Nobody should do this work."

MealPrepSunday,fkoeysh,t3_fjmkby,1584385873.0,Here's my problem with brisket: It's too yummy. I'd chomp through that in a couple of days and then wash it down with a couple monster servings of guilt with a side of shame.
BipolarReddit,fkndgrj,t3_fjhbt6,1584362756.0,"I have been worrying about this myself. This is the time of year when I begin the climb up, and I can feel it. My gym has closed and someone I care for (physically, but also emotionally) is at high risk. I very nervous right now.

I'm doing my best to stick to my routines. I've started running in place and doing bodyweight exercises instead of the gym. I'm paying attention to what I eat and making sure I stay active during the day. I'm trying to limit my social media.

Mostly, I'm just doing everything I can to maintain my schedule by looking for analogs I can do at home. I'm also taking 2.5mg olanzapine and can go up to 5 if needed, which I expect I'll need."

bipolar,fkbuvqv,t1_fkbmhy3,1584040332.0,"Yeah, that's something that really snuck up on me. Spending a couple weeks constantly moving 20+ hours a day has started to become extremely painful. My back HURTS. Like just a constant spasm."

bipolar,fkb1rud,t3_fha1kd,1584024352.0,"I have this theory about mania. When I was younger, it wasn't a big deal. Hell, it could even be fun. It was a real wild ride at an age where people are expected to have real wild rides and you could find people willing to join your real wild ride. I mean, not always, even then people would disappear when you put your name in to run for governor, but you could really find a lot of people willing to go along with a lot of stuff.

Now that I'm in my 40s, nobody has any time or desire to be around my wild rides, so I get really angsty about it. The angst turns into irritability, and my energy levels just keep rising, and my wild ride turns into spicy depression.

That's my theory. I don't know what other people experience, but there it is.

SPICY DEPRESSION."
minnesota,fkarjou,t3_fha1tx,1584017664.0,This is just surreal. It's just all so wild and a little bit scary.
history,fk8dndn,t1_fk8bfl7,1583954106.0,"Oh you didn't offend me. It's fine. I'm just a little overly sensitive about it right now. I live in a city now and have super liberal friends who are great most of the time, but they really love to shit on rural populations. All that gets really amped up during an election.

Everyone thinks that people in the country have the exact same lives as people in the city, but somehow are still less evolved and need to be shown the way. It's really maddening."
history,fk7xalz,t1_fk7nta7,1583945343.0,"Exactly. I read this question and immediately thought that's some city people thinking. I grew up in rural Iowa. We had a hand pump. I knew people with outhouses. I didn't have an address.

Modernity is a concept for people who live in cities, and those cities exist in no small part because of poor people in the country. If cities couldn't benefit from the labor of the rural poor, they would collapse."

BipolarReddit,fjey2be,t3_fd3wh8,1583280339.0,"Yes, the difference is when the psychosis occurs. Schizoaffective disorder is a mood disorder with episodes of psychosis occuring separate from the mood episodes. The psychosis can still be episodic, but it must happen when you aren't having a mood episode.

I was originally diagnosed with sza, and was switched to Bipolar 1 last year. The biggest difference for me was in how the focus became my mood rather than psychosis, so mood stabilizers and low dose antipsychotics rather than high does antipsychotics as a primary medication.

I believe bipolar 1 is a better fitting diagnosis for me, based on the treatment. I do occasionally have mild psychotic symptoms outside of a mood episode, but having my mood be the primary focus has been tremendously helpful. That's my experience, though. Everyone is different."
BipolarReddit,fjc98n2,t1_fjbxs8l,1583212166.0,Ha. Yeah. I feel really amazing and suddenly my friends disappear.
bipolar,fj0ien0,t1_fj0hmmx,1582900693.0,"Yeah... I feel that. My hair used to be super thick, with a really lovely strawberry blonde color, and great big curls. It has thinned considerably since, enough that the curls just don't look right. It's greying too, and although I like the grey, it makes the color a little dull and mousey. Couple that with my other body image issues, and wigs happen.

I tend to think that with a really good wig I might be able to relive a piece of my halcyon days, when being at the right point of an upswing meant love and sex and joy. People my age just have no interest in hypo/manic shenanigans, so it's all frustration and irritability. :-/"
bipolar,fj0fxc1,t1_fj0dqui,1582899011.0,SAME. Hahaha! I came here to make this comment! What is it about wigs?
BipolarReddit,fiuyoju,t3_f9womr,1582750646.0,"Sobriety (alcohol and opiates for me) has helped me immensely. Using doesn't cause my symptoms, but it exaggerates them and causes them to last longer. Any respite using gives me gets paid back tenfold. It really sucks.

I'm not perfect. I just relapsed a couple weeks ago. I still believe that sobriety has helped me and will continue to help me."
