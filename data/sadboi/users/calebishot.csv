AskReddit,fko97l4,t3_fjkenb,1584382587.0,"I put an engine on a bicycle, and was too scared to use it on the roads cuz it could only go 30-35 and South florida roads are crazy, so i used it on the sidewalk. One time, there was a hedge on my right so i couldn't see what was to my right past it. Turned out to be a 4x4 truck, pulling out. I don't know how it didnt hit me, but it was inches away. Oh, but thats not the closest i came to dying. 

About a week later, its dark out and im pushing my bike to its limits. Im listening to a song that reminds me of my ex, and who i believed at the time to be my next, singing my heart out. I had half a steak cuban in my backpack, i had just got paid, and it was a good day. The next thing i know, i hear ""What's your name?"" ""Do you remember what happened?"" and ""You're being airlifted to a hospital, try and remain calm.""

Im still not 100 percent sure what happened. Everyone guess hit and run, but personally? I think my bike couldnt handle going on the sidewalks at 30-40 mph every day for over a month, and the front wheel fell off. From there im guessing the bracket thing that holds the wheel in place hit the ground, and i went over the front of my bike at least going 30 mph, and faceplanted, knocking me out instantly.

I would have died if not for the employee of the funeral home it happened in front of, checking to see if theres any people parked in front of the place doing drugs, having sex, or just taking up space (south floridas real fun) because they had a service in 30 minutes. Instead he saw me, bleeding out in the street. I had a broken nose and several lacerations on my tongue, it left a scar under my eye and a lump in my bottom lip, along with some bruising under my nose that wont go away. I am lucky to be alive.  What really made it all surreal is, that was the same place we had my dads funeral at barely a year before. The place holds 2 of my worst memories now."

We use an electric pellet smoker, and it seems to work unreasonably well. Our turkey i believe we also smoke past 160, and our turkey turns out great. Although we only do whole turkeys on request, we do turkey legs reguarly. The owner, my stepdad, said there was a reason he picked an electric pellet smoker. Im sure the flavor comes out differently if you use an actual wood burner, but the juiciness and tenderness of our chicken alone, which we like to pull at 170, is unreal. I use this subreddit solely for seeing other peoples products, and i love discussing them. Im a young smokester, and i wanna master this craft, and this subreddit seems like a good start. I wasnt trying to throw any shade, i just thought it looked burnt, and as someone who runs a smokeshop that sells chicken, i just wanted to hear his side of things."
