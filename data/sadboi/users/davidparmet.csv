The sort of stuff you would have heard on WDRE in New York in 1986. This is the soundtrack of my early adulthood. Most of it's from a year or so after I graduated college, so it's a bit too late for the stuff I spun at my school's radio station (I'll get to that in a future mix). If you were a cool kid in New York or LA or any decent sized city in the mid 80s, this is what you would be hearing in the clubs.

Enjoy!"

Mostly me fooling around and trying to relearn everything I forgot since I last dj-ed in college in the mid-80s.

I never lost the dj bug. I obsessively collect vinyl and I try to keep up with new music, genres and trends. A few friends dj and they encouraged me to 'just do it.' I also saw Grandmaster Flash a few months ago, which was amazing (as you could imagine) and sealed the deal for me.

This is very rough, I'm still learning all the new things I can do that I couldn't do on the old mixing board in 1982. But I had a blast making it.

Song list:

Morton Anderson - Keep Waiting

Isolée - Beau Mot Plage

Simon Janvier - Rooms

Ryan Thomson Interpretation - 30 Hits of LSD

Michael Otten - A Jazz Thing (Vin Vega Remix)

Anjey Sarnawski - Blissful

Max Linderman - The Last Tri

Weekend of Robots - Happy With My Past"

It was mostly fade one song into the next, then every 15 minutes or so, in my best NPR voice ""and before that you heard... and before that you heard..."" 

I love music - I have close to 1,000 LPs - and I never lost the DJ bug. 

I know a few folks who DJ, one on vinyl and a few with controllers hooked up to Rekordbox. One encouraged me to buy a cheap controller and start playing around. I picked up a Pioneer DDJ-200, which I quickly outgrew and I have a DDJ-400 on its way from Amazon this week. I love all the new things (well, new for me) you can do with DJ software that I couldn't do back in 1983. 

I'm a bedroom DJ, I have no desire to work clubs or parties; I'm doing this for my own enjoyment. I've been playing around with stuff from when I was in college, some trip-hop and I recently discovered micro-house (love it!). I'll probably start sharing my mixes here;  I have a couple up on Mixcloud already."
