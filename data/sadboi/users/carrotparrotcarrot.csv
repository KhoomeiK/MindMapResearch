For me any fast longer than 20:4 is too extreme (and even 20:4 is very hard for me!) and I suspect half the fasting proponents on here have disordered eating.

When I was at school the PE teacher used to tell me (in front of the class) ‘dance across the room!’ So I would and then she’d say to everyone ‘that’s how to not do it’. My friends also used to enjoy making a big circle around me dancing so everyone would look :( then I only danced when I was in clubs and that wasn’t for long...

I don’t know how to shake my hatred of it! ‘Come and have fun, relax!’ Is impossible to me. I’m out of time (despite having a good sense of rhythm), I’m gangly and lanky, I just ... I hate it. It’s not fun or relaxing it’s just torture. I’m tall and that makes me feel like I stick out more too."
