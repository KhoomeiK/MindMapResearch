breakingmom,fqu84hf,t3_gko352,1589653866.0,If my mom lived close I would have her over all the time. Close family relationships are so important. I’m sorry your husband is being a turd. Hugs
breakingmom,fqu7wnz,t3_gkz2nu,1589653746.0,I think that is totally fair. If he wants to do dad things he should be concentrated on the child and not you. You’re definitely not crazy!
breakingmom,fqu7bsw,t3_gkxpf3,1589653427.0,"Oh geez, this would be rough. What do you think about experimenting with wigs? It might be fun to try out some new looks and not worry about looking harsh. Hugs"

breakingmom,fqu72yy,t3_gku98r,1589653290.0,"Yeah, I would feel silly but also he mad at this. He could have cleaned them so they were like new. Hugs"

schizoaffective,fa9ukjk,t3_e7x6hd,1575892471.0,I think a doctor would be better to ask. Hugs
schizoaffective,fa9ujdc,t3_e7yee0,1575892431.0,I’m not on invega but I’m glad some of these have gone away with a smaller dose. When I lowered my geodon a lot of things went away. Hugs
schizoaffective,fa9ufnl,t3_e800zb,1575892302.0,Have you tried DBT for your anxiety? Distress tolerance is hard but it works for me and gets easier over time. Have you talked to your doctor about your anxiety? I try to leave the house every day even if it is just a walk down the street. Getting your feet out the door is the hardest part. Hugs
schizoaffective,fa9u9vb,t3_e84fat,1575892090.0,"It sounds like this is a bad fit. He can’t blame his illness for all of his actions. Is he taking his meds as prescribed? If so, maybe they aren’t working. He has to take responsibility for getting better and for his actions even if he was in an episode. I would run and never look back! Hugs"
schizoaffective,fa9trbv,t3_e86x0l,1575891410.0,It is always scary changing medicine but what you’re on isn’t working so you might as well try. If you don’t like it you can switch! Hugs
schizoaffective,fa85p24,t3_e7xzae,1575841517.0,I haven’t been on it but I heard it was okay. I heard you don’t gain weight on it. Good luck. Hugs
schizoaffective,fa5j7yp,t3_e7u7fh,1575815576.0,They seem really similar but I would clarify with your doctor. Hugs
schizoaffective,fa5j0j5,t3_e799z2,1575815513.0,I did have a late onset with a slow progression to my biggest one. I had no insight so it went on for 6 months before I got help. I would schedule something with your doctor ASAP before it gets worse. Hugs
schizoaffective,fa5e2gl,t3_e7d4ru,1575814195.0,Sorry you’re going through this. I hope you feel better soon! Hugs
schizoaffective,fa5dybi,t3_e7nqgk,1575814144.0,Good luck! Hugs
schizoaffective,fa5akvw,t1_f9w6j7q,1575813223.0,They aren’t the best but I guess better than nothing.
schizoaffective,f9hyl2k,t3_e556ty,1575324292.0,I take strattera and Wellbutrin to help with them.
breakingmom,f7fd79u,t3_dvr4od,1573676933.0,I feel this so much! Usually I join and ignore but recently I felt compelled to buy a book where shipping was more expensive than the stupid book.
breakingmom,f6pdk7v,t3_ds51xf,1573053922.0,If I had to bet you are not annoying! Hugs
schizoaffective,f6o49cc,t3_ds5a01,1573007348.0,Sorry that happened. You’re being strong and doing the right thing. Hugs

schizoaffective,f5qbe0l,t3_dol8rg,1572375042.0,It doesn’t hurt to have friends that share similar interests. Hugs
schizoaffective,f5qb02h,t3_donj5u,1572374908.0,I have to take sleeping pills. I’m on trazadone for sleep right now. Hugs
schizoaffective,f5jb0vh,t3_dmkoo4,1572223646.0,My hallucinations are no big deal either but I can’t handle the delusions so I stick to my meds. Your meds are probably almost out of your body by now so I would get on them again soon. They take a while to work. Hugs
schizoaffective,f5j8rf9,t3_do0rwc,1572222798.0,"I also felt special because I could talk to ghosts. Before my onset and medication I was really motivated and getting promotions at work. Then it all stopped when I got sick. I felt the same as you like frozen. Eventually with time I started pushing myself more and more. I’m still not where I want to be though. 

Here is a handy little trick that might help you. Every time you do something put a penny into a bowl and then see how many pennies you have at the end of the day. This may help motivate you. Hugs"
schizoaffective,f5ix70p,t3_dmmtxn,1572218892.0,Mine does I think. I think it gets higher pitched.
schizoaffective,f5igeba,t3_dmp8z7,1572214214.0,Maybe if you push through it will become a routine and not take so much of your energy. Hugs
schizoaffective,f5ifef6,t3_dn9tgf,1572213926.0,I have missing memories too. It really sucks and I’m not sure if it is the medicine or the illness. Hugs
schizoaffective,f5if6lu,t3_dncg0x,1572213881.0,It is hard not to bring your work stress home with you. I’m glad you’ve got a plan to feel better! Hugs
schizoaffective,f5ierli,t3_dnddib,1572213732.0,I’m sorry you’re going through it. I hope you can sort out and get your meds figured it out. Hugs
schizoaffective,f5ie8th,t3_dniiri,1572213637.0,You should definitely try to take your medicine at the same time every day. Sometimes it isn’t convenient but set your alarms for when you take your pills. Hugs
schizoaffective,f5id9cy,t3_dnik5y,1572213356.0,Yeah don’t think you’re a bad girlfriend at all. It is perfectly normal to want your mom. Hugs
schizoaffective,f5icyki,t3_dnl86g,1572213282.0,I would definitely mention it to your doctor but not stop your meds. How scary! Hugs
schizoaffective,f5icola,t3_dnprns,1572213180.0,You have the opposite issue as me. I can see where you wouldn’t like that though. Feeling compelled to do something is not good. Can you try some DBT techniques like distress tolerance? Hugs
schizoaffective,f5icect,t3_dnt7ti,1572213068.0,That is a very common side effect of being hypo and I know it can be uncomfortable. Why don’t you want to take meds?
schizoaffective,f5ibxmq,t3_dnt8sz,1572212987.0,I just got fire emblem 3 houses for my birthday.
schizoaffective,f5ibr3b,t3_dnvi7s,1572212938.0,Yeah I get this sometimes too. I think it has to do with empathy. Hugs
schizoaffective,f50k4qq,t1_f502rca,1571928656.0,This is very similar to me.
schizoaffective,f4aixtm,t3_dk43z4,1571495949.0,Not really. It can make me tired though.
schizoaffective,f3ve1ok,t3_di5ybn,1571174849.0,I’m sorry that happened to you. Hugs
schizoaffective,f3vdbeb,t3_di7naw,1571174590.0,I have a book I write things in when I’m stable. I have things like no one is poisoning you. Maybe you could write you can’t cause earthquakes. Hugs
schizoaffective,f3d97ca,t3_dgdt79,1570833464.0,I take geodon and it works well for me.
schizoaffective,f3d7fdl,t3_dghey4,1570832834.0,"I have as needed geodon for when psychosis comes on. Maybe your doctor will do that for you.

schizoaffective,f27t9k1,t3_dccg99,1570045621.0,That is really hard. It like ruins your good mood because you think is it going too far? Hugs

schizoaffective,f26ooj0,t3_dc2a1m,1570018899.0,I take trazadone for sleep and that usually helps. Hugs
schizoaffective,f26nywn,t3_dc5gdq,1570018240.0,I’m so sorry you’re feeling this way. Paranoia is not fun. I get bleed through symptoms and have an as needed I can take. Maybe you could talk to your doctor about that? Hugs
schizoaffective,f1ifnyg,t3_d9hlyr,1569509931.0,There is a 10% chance but even if you have the vulnerability you can try not to trigger it by staying away from drugs and using good stress management techniques. Hugs
schizoaffective,f1cznhc,t3_d7vfn5,1569370011.0,Great post! Hugs
schizoaffective,f1cz84u,t3_d8rzwm,1569369695.0,Happy birthday! I also thought I had a strong sense of self but I recently got laid off and realized how much of my identity I put in towards my job. Now I’m learning who I am without a job even though I am trying to get a new one quickly. Hugs
schizoaffective,f1cz0ol,t3_d8vdlq,1569369540.0,That is great! It isn’t easy to have a conversation with a stranger. Great job! Hugs
schizoaffective,f0w7cdo,t3_d6qard,1569000671.0,I’m glad you’re doing so much better. I have breakthrough symptoms too but usually when I’m stressed. Have you talked to your doctor about going into your own world? Hugs
BipolarReddit,f007h5u,t3_d34tm0,1568298236.0,How about put that money into local services for mentally ill people instead of cutting that from the budget.
schizophrenia,eyz99en,t3_czetk5,1567612502.0, It’s okay. Hugs
schizophrenia,eyz97ng,t3_czf1vt,1567612469.0,Delusions can stick around for a long time. It took my medicine 1.5 months to work and even then I had lingering delusions. It seems like this one is pretty harmless. Good luck. Hugs
breakingmom,eyz0vgo,t1_eyyxp1i,1567606905.0,There is a conference coming up but it is over $4000 so I won’t be able to make it. I do think that is a good idea to work on the hygiene stuff and cert. thanks!
schizophrenia,eyyuzqp,t3_czfv4v,1567602562.0,I guess believing in ghosts is considered magical thinking. I was told I was seeing and talking to ghosts when I was younger. Hugs
schizophrenia,eyyurpp,t3_czh81r,1567602382.0,That wasn’t true for me. It seems like your dad is trying to make sense of things. Hugs
schizophrenia,eyyuhi5,t3_czhqwr,1567602153.0,Are you on the lowest effective dose of your antipsychotic? Hugs
schizophrenia,eyyuevo,t3_czhx6u,1567602092.0,Remember that they saw value in you. You have to see it too. Maybe something bad will happen but you can’t count on that. You have to try and maybe everything will be fine. You won’t know if you don’t try. You can do it! Hugs
schizophrenia,eyyu5ot,t3_czk4gy,1567601885.0,"I’m sorry for your loss. I don’t remember your original post but we are mostly people with schizophrenia that presents in a huge variety of ways. It is hard to give advice on how to help someone else that we don’t know personally. Doctors are better resources. Again, I’m sorry for your loss."
breakingmom,eywyidg,t1_eyww38h,1567540766.0,Sorry you’re going through this too. I did get 7 weeks severance so I can at least take that time. I do want to work so I’m going to keep saying it. Thanks!

Maybe you feel better because of the medicine? Maybe you need a tweak. Hugs"
schizophrenia,eyw5d8u,t3_cz5771,1567521308.0,Sometimes I have to fight to remember the common words and sometimes they come and other times I say something wrong. I am on meds and not having symptoms but I know sometimes I will still have a pause. It makes me embarrassed because it makes me feel stupid. It makes me feel bad when people point it out because I already know it is happening but I can’t control it. Hugs
schizoaffective,eyw56f9,t3_cyyp5m,1567521171.0,You don’t have to be really bad to have our illness. I didn’t mind the hallucinations but I couldn’t live with the delusions and my family couldn’t live with the mood swings. You just treat the symptoms. Hugs
