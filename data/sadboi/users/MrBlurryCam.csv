When we looked at TA 96, it was largely painted in a positive light. It promoted local telecommunications competition and required networks to be interconnected. It was also the first revision to telecommunications since 1934 when they broke up Bell Telephone (a huge monopoly). During that time every aspect of telecommunications had changed and was in dire need of new regulations, this bill was an attempt to prepare for the coming digital age.

Maybe I have a rudimentary understanding of the law and its effects, but just because Joe voted for something and our man Bernie did not, does not make it bad. If this act was actually corporate shilling please let me know."

AskReddit,ff72h6e,t1_ff6du3b,1579639795.0,"Yes my story is personal, I can really only share my personal experience. I am not a lawyer, a judge, or a family service professional. I do, however, work with children, and by extension their parents. So I can provide another account. I have been deposed on the contents of a lunch box ( pretty standard 10 year old in Los Angeles lunch) when a mother complained about a father “not caring for the child”. I’d never met mom, or interacted with her. I did meet the social worker, who said she was representing the mother, not the child. I had met dad, every morning as he shuttled his three kids in LA traffic to various summer camps on his way to work. Dad lost the case. I never saw his son at my facility again.


I go to a group, men who have been or continue to be abused by their mothers. My case, both legally and personally is not unique. Do I have a bias, absolutely. I also have PTSD. Denying a problem exists that many people have tried to speak on for years is unfair. In the past several years sharing stories of power imbalance and personal anecdotes has given rise to powerful, justified movements. 

I’d like to invite anyone else, both sides, to share. There are problems here and everywhere, and when people share their experiences and are dismissed out of hand those problems can never be solved."
AskReddit,ff6c8kk,t1_ff6778c,1579624033.0,"Hi there, child of divorced parents.

This does happen, and it is quite aggressively pro-mother.  My mother wanted custody of my brother. My brother wanted to live with my dad, and I was 17. So I was going to do what I wanted.  My mother became physically abusive to me during the divorce, I went to the police to file a report and press charges, at this point I was 18. The police, courts, DCFS refused to file my report or press charges because ""she is you mother, you have to respect your mother, how could a women in a wheelchair hurt 6 ft 2 MrBlurryCam"". Well she can (a 100 pound power chair moving at full speed into your body leaves bruises, it hurts and it doesnt matter how big you are.  My father pretty much had to fight until my brother turned 18 (approximately 3 years) even though my brother repeatedly said in court and through Guardian Ad Litem ""mom is unstable, i want to live with dad"". Because ""it is best for a child to have a relationship with the mother"", so let's issue a  continuance until both parties come to an agreement"".

So yes, this does happen. It happened to my brother, father and I. There are support groups and everything. Family Attorney's don't make decisions, judges and child services does. I am by no means in the ""mEn aRe BeINg OpREssed"" club.  But these things happen to men in the court system, and I get why, there are so many scummy men. But it well and truly sucked to be disregarded because I am a ""big strong man"" and that fathers are bumbling idiots without any idea how to care for children. This experience broke my father, a kind and gentle man, because everytime he went into the courtroom he was framed as the ""dead-beat dad"". Which he is certainly NOT.

So yeah, the people who actively make money and hold livelihoods related to this system, might say this doesn't happen. But I've been on the other side and I guarantee it does, /u/Inquisitor-Ajaxus  is definitely not wrong, and would venture to say he is 100% correct."

Political Scientists have tried for a long time to move towards actions they call ""Peacebuilding"". Which is about finding the cause of conflicts instead of just managing them with more force.

Hence, the peacekeeping budget is situated in the Department of Defence because it has more to do with military force than singing songs and holding hands.  That should also make clear how the United States uses the United Nations. It is essentially an extension of US ""hard power"" politics."
