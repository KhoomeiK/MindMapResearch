Run Wdidle, ran just fine like you said, many thanks!! Default was of course set to 8sec. I set it to 300sec. instead of completely disabling it and see how it goes with the LCC.

To be sure, re-checked it after a power cycle and it stayed at 300sec.

Also, just be sure if WD haven't changed the WD40EZRZ to PMR without notice:  checked if TRIM shows as a feature or not (also an indication for SMR/PMR as I read): TRIM doesn't show up.

Er moet gewoon een meer jaren plan komen, wat niet om de dag aangepast wordt. Langzaam aan in stapjes veranderen.

Dan kunnen er investeringen gedaan worden die uitvoerbaar zijn, boeren financieel overleven en bovenal kunnen consumenten zich aanpassen.

WD Blacks are indeed a lot more expensive, they were out of the question actually. I had a 1TB  (years ago) and the noise drove me insane, I was glad I could exchange it for a Blue. Didn't expect that they also aggressive head parking actually.

I thought that WDIDDLE didn't work on the ""repainted"" Blue, but I checked the link and it's confirmed to be still working, like you also described in your reply.

Reason I asked it, is because that I also saw posts that the head parking is not as an big issue as people thought it was years ago.

I already read a lot about the head parking thing. I still don't understand why WD repainted the > 1TB with the Green features. Currently have 2x 1TB Blues. Working fine, ok had to replace them under warranty, but I had backups.

But, the Seagate is of my list right now, not a drive to work on.

> I now have a ST4000DM004 and I can tell you the 4 TB variant is NOT SMR.

I think you mean the WD40EZRZ?

Yeah, was also thinking of the Toshiba X300, 7200RPM, could be a bit louder than the WD? Or well, current drives are also 7200RPM.

Toshiba could also be an option, certainly, have to read about that one.
Their external drives (for backup) aren't really good available, but that doesn't really matter if the external is an WD for example.

Just afraid of the WD Blacks, those where so loud in my desktop case that I exchanged them for Blue's (years ago).
But certainly a PMR drive and maybe no head parking (or not so agressive?)
