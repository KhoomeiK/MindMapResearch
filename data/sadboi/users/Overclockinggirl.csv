So there were 9, 3 week old kittens, 2 adult cats, and 3 human boys under the age of 7 running around. We were trying to leave and even though I was trying my best to be very careful, I took a tiny step backwards to avoid tripping on one of the adult cats in front of me and I stepped on one of the tiny kittens. For a split second I honestly thought I killed it. She/he looked like it had a tiny seizure or something and I had a mini panic attack and ran into a different room because I felt sick to my stomach. My niece held the kitten and consoled it while it was crying. Eventually she/he seemed ok and went back to playing with their siblings.

My mother was disabled and I know it would’ve broken her heart if she couldn’t get to me to help me. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder almost 2 years ago and it is a tough battle but I am doing ok now. I will say that hospitalizations were 100% necessary about 4-5 times in my life. I tried committing suicide twice and failed, obviously. Then voluntarily committed myself after that because I realized I couldn’t go on living that way. Unfortunately, even after being hospitalized twice during that severe, 2 year long depressive episode, it didn’t get me to a euthymic mental state. Now that I am on the correct medication (mood stabilizer and LOW dose of an SSRI), I feel better than ever. I can say first hand that alcohol does not mix with bipolar disorder. I am struggling with that reality now but I’m working on it. I would say your best bet would be to call 911 or perhaps, if she is more stable today, the non-emergency number for the location she lives. I’m sure you can google it and find their number. Explain the situation and see if they can help. You could also try contacting NAMI (National Alliance of Mental Illness). Also, don’t beat yourself up and try to take care of yourself. It can be very draining trying to help someone with mental illness. I have lost many wonderful friends and even immediate family members because they weren’t able to balance their own lives and try to support me and help me. Deep down, I am a very happy, loving, calm, friendly person. However, when I am either manic or depressed, I’m a totally different person. It can scare people away and make them feel uncomfortable. If you have any other questions, feel free to direct message me. I hope this helped."

Enneagram,f7cxjru,t1_f7cu7hd,1573602374.0,"Wow. The part where you said waking up at 90 years old and realizing you never actually lived your life or did anything you wanted to do... that describes me exactly. My full time job is actually similar to your idea of torture. I work a 9-5 in a boring office and I do repetitive work over and over. 

When I had a severe, full blown manic episode about 2 years ago, I thought for sure I was going to be famous and I could leave my job. I went to California with a friend and she left me there (I also had psychosis and ran out of money so although it sucked, I sort of don’t blame her in a way). 

I think I definitely get really excited about things. I just started doing yoga with a friend, making other new friends, I want to write a book, maybe do acting classes and dance classes. My best friend of several years recently dropped me like a bad habit and I’m sort of reinventing myself if you will. I’m sad, but I’m not letting it ruin my life. I’ve finally accepted that I’m not everyone’s cup of tea.

I actually get about a month of paid vacation time and I feel like that’s a decent amount. I have terrible self discipline so I don’t think I could be self employed unless I tried really really hard at it. I just feel like I have so many talents buried inside my lil soul and I’m going to explode if I don’t show the world. Even if I turn out like Arthur Fleck from joker, and I’m just a big “mentally ill joke”, I’ll be proud of myself for at least trying (I won’t kill anyone either). 

I bet your grandkids will tell all their friends how bada** their granny is! You sound like someone I would get along with and you’re so kind for posting this long novel out for a stranger!

I absolutely try to distract myself from negative feelings (mostly drinking alcohol or drawing and painting). I’m definitely a glass half full type of person (at least when I’m not in the depths of a psychotic, suicidal depressive episode. Those are fun). I think I communicate through “personal storytelling” which is what I feel like I’m doing right now sort of, oops.

I would say my fashion is pretty eclectic and I’m totally jealous you have a rainbow cat shirt from Japan! Sounds awesome. When I was manic, my fiancé said I would wear like 4-5 patterns that absolutely did not match and I dressed like a 4 year old girl dressed herself. At the time, I felt so hot and confident and I think even if I looked goofy, I owned it. *shrugs*

Hmmm, now you have my attention. I think part of me does want to be unique but I also already feel very unique. I don’t think I’m missing anything, I just want to put my ideas out there and see what happens (Art, writing a book, try acting and dancing). I only really feel envious of people who have cool names (I hate my name so much and I want to change it) and are successful and financially secure. Other than that, I like who I am inside. 

Dammit! I think I’m very independent but I’m also sort of a little codependent in my relationship. I don’t know, that’s tough. However, I hardly think about others before I act. That sounds bad but I sort of look after myself and do my thing, and if people are offended or something doesn’t work out, then that’s the way it is in my mind. I don’t try to intentionally hurt anyone but if I make someone uncomfortable (that’s what my ex best friend said about me and why she kicked me out of her wedding), then I just won’t spend time with you anymore. I just speak my mind and do my thing. I’m only ever just being honest and authentic.

I can relate to that. I feel like I’m a very nice person deep down and I love making people laugh and smile. But it’s sort of on my own terms. 

This helped a lot! I’m definitely leaning more towards 7 based on what you said here but, I feel like I can identify with bits and pieces of some of the other ones too.

Some people are commenting on the post not being about me and although I don’t know with 100% certainty that it is, I’m just taking a wild guess with how our last couple conversations went. Something along the lines of me making everyone uncomfortable and our relationship being toxic. Oh, and she said “clearly nobody else will put up with you either” which was probably referring to yet another “friend” who abandoned me across the country during a vacation. I know it probably is difficult to be around me during an episode but it hurts that my stable periods don’t count for anything."

He also suggested one students’ ceramic dish they had made could be used to store condoms which I thought was a very strange thing to say. Whenever I think of ceramics or pottery, I think of him."

BipolarReddit,f76ulp1,t1_f5fkp21,1573436202.0,"When I was manic I actually wanted to do stand up comedy so badly. I ended up going to this bar down the street and saw they had an open mic night so I went. I didn’t have any jokes practiced or anything, I was just going to get up there and start talking because I had been making so many people laugh and they were telling me to go do stand up. Anyway, I walk in and there’s this jolly old Santa looking dude with his dog and I asked him how do I sign up for open mic? He points to the sign up sheet next to him. I glance at it and see that there’s 16 lines all filled in, except line #1. I smack his shoulder gently and say, “Hey Santa, looks like I’m #1!” And he was PISSED. He’s like “what’s the big idea? I’m trying to watch the show” and I was PISSED because he didn’t think I was funny. I slammed a beer there and went to a different bar and got drunk, alone. Then I went and hung out with a bunch of homeless people and they all laughed at my jokes (and probably just at me). My partner told me if I would have done stand up that night, it would’ve been a mix between Sweet Dee’s stand up from Always Sunny and Arthur Fleck’s first couple acts from joker."

schizophrenia,f72oem3,t1_f72nwwk,1573371519.0,"I mean I’m fairly certain I had depression with psychotic features but that was never formally diagnosed. I was diagnosed with mania with psychotic features and shortly thereafter, got the bipolar 1 diagnosis. It’s not really cut and dry. Just be honest and get a second and third opinion if necessary. But don’t ever feel bad about being yourself and trying to get an accurate diagnosis even if it means you lose friends or family. Anyone that truly loves you and supports you, will not abandon you. It wasn’t the people I was expecting to stick around that did in the end."
schizophrenia,f72nqbp,t1_f72mgjj,1573370577.0,"Everyone has a little crazy in them. It’s just not appropriate to admit or talk about. Even people without schizophrenia have “insane” thoughts but as long as they don’t act on them or talk about them, nobody would ever call them “crazy” because their thoughts don’t startle them enough to seek help. People can keep thoughts hidden for a long time and even eventually act on them and keep their *actions* hidden for a long time before anyone starts calling them “crazy”. Insane and crazy are all subjective. People have a threshold of insanity that they can handle. Once you cross that, there’s nothing much you can do. Just try to be honest and if he doesn’t accept you, find people that do."
BipolarReddit,f72ma5a,t1_f72m8z2,1573368622.0,So interesting! Thanks for commenting
BipolarReddit,f72l1ej,t1_f72kuse,1573367110.0,I wonder how many people with bipolar disorder are classified as this personality type or visa versa. It’s just an interesting thought for me!
BipolarReddit,f72kz39,t1_f72kt6c,1573367036.0,"I can understand that. I find it very interesting. I have my bachelors in Psychology so I studied a lot about personalities and the like. I love personality tests and this is honestly the only one that makes me feel understood as silly as that sounds. But because I also have bipolar disorder, I find a lot of the traits (highs and lows) sort of mesh with that so I was wondering if anyone else had a similar reaction when they’ve read about ENFPs."

schizophrenia,f71fxkz,t1_f71fe2k,1573341146.0,"When I smoked weed my psychotic depression went from awful to *I should probably go to the hospital because I think my teacher is going to rape and kill me* (he absolutely wasn’t going to and he didn’t do anything for me to believe that, I was just psychotic and paranoid). I absolutely cannot smoke weed. Unless they legalize it where I live and can guarantee me a strain that will make me calm and chill, I won’t touch it. It’s not worth it."

bipolar,f717ik2,t3_dtz5mb,1573337287.0,"Woah. When I was manic I was 100% sure I was bisexual also. I think I’m still bicurious and I would like to experience more with women. I remember having trouble differentiating between being sexually attracted to a girl or just wanting to look like her/be like her etc. It’s nice to hear others have gone through the same thing. At the end of the day, I guess it doesn’t really matter what my sexual preference is, as long as I’m happy, which I am for once!"

BipolarReddit,f6xgjvh,t1_f6xddpz,1573249133.0,"If I’m being 100% honest, I don’t remember. It was like I was on autopilot. I also slept for 11-15 hours a night so it wouldn’t be that difficult. I mean I was still extremely depressed but not necessarily tired. I definitely had psychotic depression and I was “planning on committing suicide” but I was “planning” it for months. It was more of like this weird thinking where I like didn’t take care of anything or do anything for over a year. I didn’t open mail, I hardly ate, I didn’t take very good care of my cat (which is awful but true... I take much better care of her now). Anyways, I was certain that I would be on the news because everyone would eventually find out how “crazy” I was. It was really bizarre. I’m rambling but I guess my answer is I just did it. I don’t really know how. But I do know I was unbelievably depressed and obsessed with suicide. It’s hard, but if I can do it, I know you can. I am finally on the right medication and doing much better. Work is a lot better when you are stable."
