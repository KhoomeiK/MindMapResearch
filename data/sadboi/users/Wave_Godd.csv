Nuraphone,fn0cbq5,t3_fyd80j,1586539332.0,Yea be careful with this company. Product is cheaply made. They don't have a repair department for a pair of 400$ headphones. They don't offer extended warranty. You can't pay for either of those. If they break outside of warranty. They'll offer a shitty discount & tell you goodluck. There customer service is trash.

Honestly super disappointed, with how they handle something so expensive. I loved these headphones. But there's no way I'll be buying another pair. Just to end up in this situation again. 

Do you reccomend any comparable headphones sound wise?"
Semenretention,fmivcub,t1_fmhsnl6,1586117677.0,"You'll recover fully with enough time. But the more you relapse. The further you push that timeframe back. So instead of initially maybe taking you a year or 2 to recover. After binge fapping for a couple months or years. It will take you 5 years or longer to recover. 

Saying we can NEVER EVER recover just doesn't make any sense to me. It defeats the whole purpose of SR. And ik some will subtly take it as an excuse to never even try. People have recovered from much worst things. Not saying this addiction isn't bad. Because this shit definitely is evil."
