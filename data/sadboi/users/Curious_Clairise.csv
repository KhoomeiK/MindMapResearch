I try to take it one step at a time; make a list/schedule and stick with it.  If everything is complete great, if not then oh well.  I'll generally add a reward if I do a certain amount of tasks to keep me motivated.

I find with people who have wronged me I try not to talk about too much.  Thoughts are thoughts but words I feel give them power.  It makes me think of them more.

Do you mind if I ask how old you are?  I know someone around their 50s without generalized anxiety (I think) and he told me it's more normal to wake up in the middle of the night the older you get.  

Have you spoken to your doctor?  Or a therapist?  I find when I have bad thoughts in my mind it carries to nightmares.  My partner told me I screamed/yelled when he burped or sneezed.

I do meditation which I find helps too.  Just five minutes a day.  Doesn't work right away but eventually it helps remind you to breathe through the moment.  Focus on the now.  Granted it doesn't help me all the time (I sometimes get panics) but it reminds me that all we have is the breath.  Insight Timer is an app (Apple and Android compatible) that's free.  

I also heard somewhere that the more/longer you consumed sugar, the worse the effects.  If possible maybe you could try reducing then eventually quitting?"

First off, being an engineer?!  That sounds cool!  Math isn't my strongest subject but I would kill for it to be.  And your resilience?  Fantastic!

It sounds to me, and please correct me if I'm wrong, that you're equating your self worth with how much you weigh.  Even though losing weight can be good, you are always worthy NOW.  Not if I lose 5 pounds, 10 pounds, workout 5 days a week, etc.

Maybe you could try thinking of 5 things you are grateful for.  That sometimes helps me when I feel bad.  For example, I'm grateful I have two arms that I can control.  

Their are also some hotlines you can call to talk about these feelings too.

socialskills,fom48ek,t3_g87ql6,1587877872.0,"I've had this experience before.  I get anxiety too in fast paced environments; my last job could be extremely fast paced.  What helped me was thinking ""this will end eventually/this won't last forever/this is only for now.""  Future oriented thinking.

I think it's good to note your anxiety kicks up in fast paced environments.  Maybe you could try volunteering first before you get a job.  I worked at the library and I liked the pace.

I definitely feel the anxiety and I have been there before.

I don't know where you're from but I feel a lot of people don't get their first job until around your age.  Maybe longer due to the current situation.

I've felt like a loser too and I still do at times.  But we don't know other people's stories; we only know our own.  Focus on being a better person then you were yesterday.  It doesn't even have to be getting a job; you could have any kind of goal.  

I think having a part time job can be great or miserable depending on your boss/coworkers/customers.  I agree with u/lolaismygirlfriend.  Easier said then done and I need to take the advice myself, but coming from someone with more life experience I think she is right.  

Best of luck!"

If you do, then maybe you can try having 1 a day or a week.  Have someone hide it in your place.

What is your goal?"
sugarfree,foem4jg,t3_g6wmzx,1587707519.0,"I think fruit is good but be careful not to overdo it.  From what I understand, the sugar in fruit isn't as harmful since the fiber allows it more time to digest in the body compared to added sugar.  It also has vitamins too.

I think one step at a time is a good approach too.  I'm trying to reduce sugar, but still have one protein drink a day that contains 1 gram of sugar.  I also eat fruits but record (mostly) everything using MyFitnessPal.  Fruit has stopped me from going to processed foods and I think I get good carbs from it too.  Maybe once I'm able to moderate better/quit it all together then I'll start with reducing fruits.

This is just my opinion, but a doctor/nutritionist could tell you more."
sugarfree,foel95w,t1_fob8fsf,1587706799.0,"I'm on day 3 of quitting/severely reducing sugar (I have a protein drink/eat fruits).  One day I had a headache so bad I didn't want to do anything.  I do find fruits help. I'm also using MyFitnessPal too so I don't overdo it.

I like to have fruit with olive oil popcorn.  That tends to help ""subside"" the cravings.  It's still there but I think remembering the goal helps.

You got this!
