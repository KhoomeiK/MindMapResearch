I deleted instagram because I felt like each picture I posted looked like an entirely different human being. I also can look in the mirror, think I’m fat, and then go back an hour later and look thin. It doesn’t make sense to me and I just don’t understand why I have no sense of self."
BodyDysmorphia,fj6b171,t3_fbmd83,1583065418.0,"21F here. This is exactly how I feel. It’s as if I wrote it myself. I work at a doctor’s office in a city where everybody is pretty much beautiful. Pretty much all of the nurses and assistants have such nice figures, even in their scrubs. Long lashes, pretty, flowy hair, small faces. Meanwhile- I’m quite the opposite. I have short curly hair, a weird round face shape, and I suck at makeup. I also look fat in my scrubs so there’s that. I’ve felt so unattractive my entire life, but I especially know the feeling of having to work around beautiful women with features you wish you had. It’s extremely depressing. Same feeling when I go out with the only 2 friends I have (because I don’t even bother to make friends from how ugly I am). I feel like a distorted looking alien compared to most people in general. I lack the confidence to let myself enjoy everything. I spend my entire day thinking about how much I wish I can change my appearance and just get an entire new face. I’ve pretty much lost my will to live because of my appearance.

OP, and for anybody else going through this, I’m so sorry that you feel this way. It’s quite mentally torturous to hate your looks to the point where you just want to die. I hate that other people feel as sad/bad as I do about their appearance. I wish I can offer some advice. That “love yourself for who you are” shit doesn’t do anything because at the end of the day if you aren’t happy about what you see in the mirror, how can you fully love yourself? *sigh* prayers for all of you going through this mental agony and fight with body image."

I was also out with my 2 very attractive friends today and I felt like an ugly, demonic gremlin compared to them in the selfies we took. The entire time we were out, I was just feeling insecure and thinking about how I wish I wasn’t ugly. I wish I at least looked normal. They have such cute, tiny noses and aesthetically pleasing faces. Meanwhile, I on the other hand look disgusting. My insecurities have ruined my life and all I think about is how hideous I am and how much better my life would be if I was/felt attractive.

I’m so sorry that you feel this way. I’m sure you are beautiful. This disorder is so messed up. I know exactly how you feel, and being called beautiful or people telling you that you aren’t ugly, etc. doesn’t help at all, because the mirror seems to tell us otherwise. I wish you all of the happiness and healing in the world and I hope you can feel beautiful one day. I’m really sorry you’re going through this :(. It sucks feeling like you are about to breakdown due to how you feel about yourself. I’ve been there and I currently feel that way as well.  If you ever want to talk, I’m all ears. ❤️"

Loving someone who is toxic for you never ends well though..... :( the “when we’re good we are great but when we are bad it’s terrible” thing is relatable. That’s how I was with my ex. (He was 100% a narc) and unfortunately the cycles just got worse and worse until I just couldn’t deal with it anymore. I know how hard it is to cut someone you love to death out of your life, especially when they’ve been there for you during your darkest moments. But if they are contributing heavily to your current sadness and anger, they are no longer good for you. Sometimes people are only meant to be in our lives for certain periods of time. I understand the whole codependency thing as well. I hope you can combat that and I hope that you can figure out what the best decision for you is at this point. 

Btw congrats on overcoming your alcohol problem also!"

He would start off just using them a little. Then become a ghost again, and only using his accounts to stalk people. Honestly it’s so creepy. Narcs are socially dysfunctional. Their entire life is an act anyway. So I’m not surprised that a lot of them are like this. They’re all so similar."

He doesn’t respect you, and seems to me that he either has anger issues, or is just projecting all of his internal issues onto you and is just really unstable.  Please get out, for the sake of your mental health and safety. He sounds like a temper-tantrum-throwing brat. And who wants to be with somebody THAT cheap? Can’t even spend $10-$20 on his girlfriend of a few years? Doesn’t take you on dates? Ugh. Also that age gap maybe makes him feel like he has more power over you so he just abuses it.

loveafterporn,f0rudd9,t3_d6az6z,1568893040.0,"First of all I’m so sorry this happened and that he feels this way. You are more than enough. Tbh a lot of porn addicts fetishize certain races. It’s very possible he fetishized you at first and that you were his ideal type, but his ideal type shifted after watching porn. I feel that this happens a lot with these PA men. They never actually know what they want and always end up bored. They are never satisfied. Always looking to jack off and that’s about it. It’s gross. That’s usually the only time they feel anything, because they are unstable and damaged. Even if you were a tall white woman, he’d eventually give you the same excuse after a while, that he is bored and wants something new.

People like that just shouldn’t pursue relationships at all. Unfortunately I feel that you really need to leave him...even if you love him and have spent years together, his mind is clearly elsewhere and he doesn’t seem to care about you on any other level besides physical. And that’s so sad. Looks aren’t everything. Sex isn’t everything. It sucks that his mindset is set up that way. 

I pray you find peace and that you have the strength to get past this and leave him for good. No one deserves to deal with that :( I left my PA ex bf this past summer and have been feeling so free ever since. I’ve been able to work on myself and my confidence and mental state and it’s been lovely. I’m sure you can do the same.

I’m in college now and some days I wouldn’t go to class because I feel disgusting and didn’t want to face people. But I’ve gotten better at forcing myself to go. The way I see it, If I get through school I can get a good job and then make money and make myself get prettier. (Plastic Surgery).

Everything you said was spot on. These men don’t even really go about their addiction in a smart manner. They just do things and hope they don’t get caught and their lies aren’t even good lies. I got tired of outsmarting my ex also. It was useless.

I really hope that you can get out of your situation soon and be with somebody who satisfies you sexually and lusts over you and only you.

Manipulative addicts’ favorite line is “you don’t love me” when you decide you don’t wanna put up with their crap anymore. I left my PA bf a few weeks ago. Found out he was exchanging nudes / sexting local women. On top of all of the porn he was already watching. I couldn’t take it anymore.

We deserve to be respected. Our partners should know their boundaries and know not to continue to do things to deliberately hurt us while not even trying to stop...it’s unfair and it’s sad because they expect us to stay and endure the pain. But if they are not even taking the steps to fix the problem, then it’s useless to stay and keep getting hurt.

It’s really hard, but you need to delete and block his number. Block him on social media, or just refrain from looking at any of his pages. You have to stop yourself. I was obsessively checking his twitter page, his likes, his fb and instagram. And I had to just force myself to stop.  It hurts and its hard. The trauma bonding is very real with narcissist.  But just remind yourself that they are doing just fine with you and that they are evil people. You deserve to be happy and be doing well also, without him.

In my situation, he was sexting / snapchatting random, local girls and masturbating to friends pics from social media as well, and when I caught him he deleted them, but wouldn’t block also. But he ended up doing it again...And again. Time would pass and I kept forgiving him, but in the end it was way too painful and heartbreaking for me to deal with, I felt worthless. ended it. 

All I’m saying is; be careful. If he refuses to block them, he may still be looking at their profiles and pics. Why should he care if they are upset if he blocks them or not? He should he caring about saving your relationship..

I hope that he is serious about changing and stopping. Therapy is usually an important step, he should consider it, because its not easy for these addicts to just stop. They stop for a while and then go back do it again. Relapse after relapse..its exhausting. I read some of your other comments under this thread.

It hurts a lot to not feel good about yourself and to feel like everybody else looks normal but you. I’m so sorry you feel this way :( I know your bf had good intentions and genuinely thinks you’re cute and beautiful etc. but some people just don’t get how it feels to want to escape yourself and your body and that’s okay, that’s why they don’t realize how much it actually upsets us when they take photos/compliment us, etc. I hope things can get better for you and that you can see yourself from a different perspective soon because I’m sure you are lovely inside and out :(

The cycle continued. He had an addiction to sexting and porn, and he wouldn’t admit it. Yet he couldn’t stop and every time I snooped, I’d find something. Just think about it. Is this the type of person you wanna spend your life with? He has a serious problem and is clearly refusing to get help. I hate to say it, but he probably is just doing a better job at hiding what he is doing now. These addicts can’t just stop. And if they do stop, they end up relapsing and doing it again and again and again until they seek genuine help.

Tbh just think about it really hard. It isn’t right for him to masturbate to old videos of his ex / past women and even friends.... It’s messed up and it’s creepy. VERY creepy. 

I’m not judging you for trying to stay and work it out because I was in that position. But it hurts more to stay  and try to fix somebody who doesn’t want to be fixed. Trust me I tried so so hard. For months to get my man to change and to help him overcome his issues with porn and sexting. Just be wary. Your bf may act like he chaned, but the fact that he continued to do it and get caught by you doesn’t seem like it. They don’t change over night. be careful, you don’t deserve to continuously deal with that kind of behavior.  He sounds an awful lot like my ex and this post hit home. Keep your eyes open."
NarcissisticAbuse,eye37t5,t3_cwmkfk,1567028203.0,"Sounds just like my Nex. He sways girls with his way of words and his ‘spirituality’ and ‘substance’ little do they know it’s all an act. He is fake deep, and fakes being enlightened and ‘woke’ lol. He is the complete opposite. He is nothing but a lost soul with a fake persona. All these narc dudes are literally the same. It’s hilarious really"
KoreanBeauty,ey7g5rz,t3_cvx37q,1566881988.0,"Tbh the upkeep with constantly getting fillers gets agitating...and expensive. Of course if you can afford to spend 600-1000 every 3-4 months then go for it. Fillers can def give you a more V shape / balanced face.they just tend to not last long, especially if you’re younger. I’m 21 and they only last 3 months for me, 4 if I’m lucky. It could be because I live a very active lifestyle though so it metabolizes quicker. Depends on the person of course!!

I’m gonna go the actual V-line route soon. I’m tired of constantly getting fillers so I’ll be shaving down my chin instead. To each their own though! Good luck :)"

loveafterporn,exzoy88,t3_cusj3x,1566669124.0,"I left my porn addicted bf a few weeks ago. He was also into watching cams and even sexting random women online and exchanging nudes. It’s sad really, they prefer online visual stimulation over real life sex with their beautiful girlfriends or wives. It feels so good not to sit and worry about all of the what ifs, and worry about whether they’re doing it or not. Porn addicts are sad, sick individuals. That’s just the truth"
loveafterporn,exm2i31,t3_ctieoq,1566423346.0,"I just want to say, that how you look does not play a part in whether or not they will stop watching porn. I’m fit and slim, petite with a big booty and big boobs, yet my boyfriend was sexting tons of women, exchanging pics, talking dirty, etc. and watching tons of porn DAILY.  How I looked, did not stop him. I was crying day and night, felt worthless, and disgusting. Yet he couldn’t stop. The women in porn that he was watching had similar bodies to me. Yet, did that stop him? No. You can be the most perfect, flawless women in the world, but a PA is a PA. Their addiction is their problem, it has nothing to do with you. It breaks my heart to see women degrade themselves and believe that they aren’t good enough, and that their man is watching porn because the other women look better. I promise that is not the case.  

Please stay strong. You are beautiful the way that you are. I promise"
loveafterporn,exi1aq3,t3_csw5lk,1566318912.0,"Ugh just the title alone made my heart sink for you. Literally just got out of my relationship because I couldn’t handle my bfs porn and sexting addiction any longer. He is never going to stop and he would lie and lie and lie. He was literally ADDICTED to snapchat. Found out he had been subscribed to tons of premiums and sexting tons of random girls on snapchat and other apps as well. It was so heart wrenching the day I found out. I looked through some of the saved convos and I cringed and cried so hard. It was ingrained my memory forever. The disgusting things he would say as well as the pictures of all of these girls. I HATE snapchat now. That app has basically become a porn site. Every time he would delete it and swear to not do it again, there the app was again. And he would try to hide it in folders and things like that too. Ridiculous. He couldn’t and didn’t want to stop. These addicted men will choose visual stimulation and sexting over their own woman. Worst feeling ever. Makes you feel worthless. 

I’m so sorry you’re going through this. especially since you are more established with this man and are having a kid together. I hope things can get better for you!! Stay strong."
loveafterporn,exhafn3,t3_cso1yh,1566298817.0,This is how I felt at all times. I was in a constant state of paranoia regarding him. My fear ended up being reality. He kept doing it again and again. Porn and sexting. He would lie to my face and I’d find out and I felt so much emotional pain that I could barely function because of what he was doing. I ended up leaving. I couldn’t handle it anymore
BodyDysmorphia,exekydr,t3_crzlwa,1566218700.0,"Ugh sorry you have to deal with this. :( I caught my boyfriend flirting, as well as exchanging nudes with multiple women on several different apps snapchat, kik, and some others. It was the worst feeling I’ve ever had to deal with in my life. I’ve had bdd / depression / anxiety basically my entire life, and he was aware of it too. When I found out, I spiraled downwards into the word depression of my life. I stopped eating, I stopped leaving the house, and I compared myself to literally every beautiful woman online and felt like garbage. I became a complete and utter mess. I hated myself and felt so worthless because he cheated on me with over 10 different women. Virtually, but it still counts as cheating. Especially when nudes are involved. 

Anyway, my point is, I managed to get myself out of that rut. My mental health has still been a constant struggle, however I realized that HIS actions have nothing to do with me. What people choose to do, has nothing to do with us. I’ve seen some of the most beautiful women get cheated on. Some people are just scum and they have zero regard for anyone’s feelings. My ex said he did it all for validation as well. That’s bullshit. They get a thrill out of that. It feels good to them. There are people out there who won’t treat us this way. And we are good enough. I promise you, you will feel much better when you realize you were never the problem, you are enough, and he is just a shitty person. Stay strong girl, I hope that things improve for you soon."
BodyDysmorphia,exekcnm,t3_cs8pvx,1566218158.0,"This post is literally me. I had a HUGE nose and I got a nosejob and it still looks weird/big.

Better than before but still ugly to me because it isn’t cute/tiny.

I’m sorry you feel this way, it is so frustrating having to live like this. I understand it 100% and I hope that it can get better one day."
loveafterporn,exbmivz,t1_exb6itg,1566134199.0,Thank you! He is more on the good looking side for sure. He did have a very promiscuous past. He has slept with many women as a teenager but he told me that his desire for hookups and one night stands faded away as he grew older (he is almost 24 now) and that he is nothing like his old self. I guess that sex addiction manifests via sexting and porn now.
loveafterporn,ex9qh5s,t1_ex99w81,1566092859.0,"Thank you!! This means a lot :) very true also. They definitely know what they are doing and choose to continue that behavior and lie rather than telling the truth and seeking therapy. (Of course, some people actually work towards getting better) but that wasn’t the case with my guy unfortunately.  I realized there was no point in putting myself down. He would do this no matter who he dated, because it’s a problem within himself. I do hope he seeks help for his own sake though, I just want no parts."
loveafterporn,ex9190n,t1_ex90ikc,1566081945.0,"I kept telling myself that I could love him out of his addiction as well...I wish it was that easy. The empty promises were the worst part. That little bit of hope that he was really going to change.

Not gonna lie, a part of me has hope that my ex will come back and prove to me that I matter more than his addiction. But it’s all just very toxic when I actually think about it. 

I know exactly how you feel. I sincerely hope that things can get better for you and that he can overcome it. If anything, please just try to stay strong and do whatever it is you feel you must do. Even if it’s just taking some space/time apart."

It can be very traumatic and painful. We don’t deserve it. It took me a while to muster up the strength to free myself from him and his addiction. Unless they are actively putting in genuine effort to get better, it’s just not worth it. I hope you find the strength as well and that you can heal."

Most of his friends are jobless and do nothing but get high / drunk all damn day and night. I think my NEX idealized me because of my career, future goals too. He had goals and aspirations but ended up giving up on them for other things that he has been very unsuccessful with. It’s strange, really.

He was always talking about wanting to die yet refused to ever seek help and continued to manipulate and gaslight everybody in his life- particularly me. But I saw right through it. It’s sad really.

Silly but true. I know a bunch of people who are filter-crazy and seeing them in person is pretty weird because you’re so used to seeing their filtered selfies and they definitely look different. I realized that most people nowadays are  addicted to filters and that’s fine as long as you don’t let it consume you and just use it for fun I guess. Personally I had to just let that phase of my life go though. It’s not worth the mental haggle of “I wish I looked like this in person, and “do I even look like this?” Ugh."
NarcissisticAbuse,ew6pk81,t3_cmu45i,1565178157.0,"Hi hun. I know exactly how you feel. I am going through the same thing. I’m going to share my experience and also share some insight with you. You are not alone, and you can heal from all of this.

Sorry if this is long.

1. I, as well, keep asking myself “what if” and “why” questions. What if I went about things differently? What if I didn’t explain how I felt properly and he misunderstood. “Why is he okay with this outcome” “why won’t he reach out and apologize? Why won’t he try harder to make this work” “why can’t we start over?” My mind is racing with tons of questions like this EVERY. DAY. Nonstop. But the truth is, people like that do not think the way that we do. They are selfish. The world revolves around them. We can ask all of the questions in the world and beg for closure, compassion, and understanding. But we most likely will not receive it from them. Any one who genuinely loved and cared for us would not leave us wondering and questioning ourselves like this, keep that in mind. I have to keep reminding myself that..

2. I always felt like I wasn’t good enough for my man also. I’ve always loved my body and felt beautiful. I eat healthy, and I’m heavily in the gym. I love to do my hair and makeup, and dress up. I generally would get a lot of compliments in public when I go out.  Even when I was with my boyfriend. But guess what- my self esteem went to the shitter after being with this guy. He would hardly compliment me. He did at first, but it slowly began to get less and less, until it stopped completely. I would do what you did. Starve myself before seeing him so I can wear sexy crop tops and booty shorts, dresses, etc. i’d show off my body and I would feel sexy, up until I’d be around him and he would rarely say a compliment, let alone touch me. He even told me once- “you know you look good. I don’t have to say it.” WTF?? I began to feel ugly. I would obsess over myself in the mirror and wondered what I needed to change for him to love my appearance again. Everyone wants reassurance and compliments from their loved one. My self esteem began to spiral downwards even more. I would try to send him sexy vids and pics also. And he would hardly react. As if he expected it from me. Sigh. These men get too comfortable. They get bored want want more. Doesn’t matter how slim or busty or sexy you are. It isnt you. It’s HIM.

3. This one hit close to home. I love the summer time. We had made plans to go on a road-trip to the beach, and do a lot of fun summer activities like boating, hiking, swimming, etc. Never happened. he never wanted to make plans before that in general. It was always me trying to make plans. He would flake on them a lot. He has depression and would always blame things on his mental health...It hurt so bad and I tried to be understanding...but I felt like he never even tried. Sometimes he would plan dates and say we are going to do something amazing. But then we would end up just staying at his house or not seeing each other at all. it felt like it was just me trying the hardest during the entire relationship. Trying to make memories and have good times with him. Meanwhile, it was like I didn’t exist sometimes. I cried a lot. Still do. We haven’t even been done for long at all and he is already on social media talking to a bunch of girls/flirting and doing whatever he wants. I feel like I’ll never heal or find love again. I feel like I’ve gone crazy. It sucks that we put so much of our effort into people who barely reciprocate it. 


to be honest? You should keep that man out of your life. If he can’t give you what you need emotionally, why even bother thinking about what could have been, or if you could have done anything differently?  you are perfect the way that you are. How he treated you does not define you...you gave it your all. Remember that.  :)

What I want to say to you, myself, and everyone else in this sub is: You are beyond good enough. Narcs fail to see the good in people. They see us as objects that they can gain something out of- until they can’t anymore. Then they treat us poorly, and eventually discard of us. It’s painful and it sucks. The emotional abuse, manipulation, and feelings of worthlessness. But at the end of the day, they are miserable people on the inside and they are just dragging you down with them. We deserve better. 

Stay strong. You can heal from this. Feel free to reach out to me if you need it. ❤️"
NarcissisticAbuse,ew6mmue,t3_cmttnf,1565176187.0,So many posts on this sub hit close to home...I’m so sorry you went through this. I’m currently trying to keep no contact as well. It’s so hard. But just think about the way he treated you and how he degrades you and gaslights you. You do not need that in your life. You deserve better and you know it. Stay strong. I hope you can heal from this and move on.
NarcissisticAbuse,ew6m7nm,t3_cmu94z,1565175839.0,"Gosh. This sounds an awful LOT like my nex. He was constantly switching personalities, changing his interests a lot. And he also once told me that he feels like he is incapable of feeling emotions 90% of the time. (What a huge red flag, can’t believe I stayed through that) also- he has claimed to “see the light” as well and became so spiritual all of a sudden. He basically began revolving his entire life around spirituality, astrology, etc. to the point where it’s all he talks about and he believes he is some sort of special, ethereal being and that everybody else is below him. He is consistently calling himself a “spiritual leader” and boasts about how he promotes positivity and self love. In my opinion the only thing he promoted to me was negativity and self hatred. Lol. Sad to say it but it’s true. Yet, everyone else saw him as charming, kind, etc. sucks how he would get praised by others when they had no idea who he really was behind closed doors...a manipulative, lying narcissist. 

Some other unsettling things about my NEX: he was a sex addict in his past,  a heavy marijuana user, and an alcoholic.

I tried to never judge him on his past. But he would spiral back into these behaviors a lot. He would smoke a LOT, would always be high. He would have phases of constantly drinking himself into a black out. Also Caught him sexting a shit ton of women. (Which led to us breaking up a week ago. I’m now done with his crap and am trying to have the willpower to stay away)

In general it’s scary how similar all narcs are. They all tend to have the same strange behavioral patterns. I read in another post that most Narcs have the same personality traits also. I definitely agree with that. It’s honestly frightening. These people are vile.

Glad you feel like you are over yours. Keep going and don’t look back. We don’t need people like this in our lives. They are sick minded."
NarcissisticAbuse,ew6ilqg,t1_ew69tjn,1565171339.0,"Thank you for this. Everything you explained is extremely accurate. And I’ve known this, but I tend to push things to the back of my mind and it’s like- a part of me didn’t want to accept the fact that I was in love with a vile, emotionless human being who viewed me as nothing but an object. He definitely isn’t a smart narc, lol, he doesn’t go about things in a manner that will keep him out of trouble or make his behavior believable for the most part. That, or he just did not care at all. 

The relationship was truly never about me and I never mattered. And if I did, it was for a VERY short period of time.  Facing reality is tough. I’m more mad and upset with myself for dealing with this for over a year, and not trust my gut feeling regarding this entire relationship. 

I guarantee even after discarding me, he will try to come back again soon. And I will laugh. Because I see right through his facade now."
NarcissisticAbuse,ew659jt,t3_cn0q2i,1565154483.0,"Gosh. I’m so sorry you had to deal with this abusive, narcissistic, sad and evil excuse of a human being. It’s good to hear you are getting a restraining order. You’re making the right decision. Somebody like that should never be around a child. What a cruel human being he is, hitting a pregnant woman? I mean hitting anybody in general is absolutely unacceptable and physically abusive. I really hope you can heal from this. I hope that you and your daughter to be have an amazing, peaceful life. I hope and pray that he stays away from you and doesn’t try to ever get involved regardless of any legalities. You are so strong."
NarcissisticAbuse,ew646dr,t3_cmwsie,1565153421.0,"Holy shit. I felt like I wrote this myself. My ex bf had the same exact affect on me. It’s like I hated him for everything he did but admired the way he went about things. I admired the way he thought, in a sense that I wish I could understand it and become one with him. But here’s the thing: we are not like these people and never will be. We do not have the capacity to stoop to their level of evil and wrongdoings. Truth is, they are not good people. Their minds are built different. but they also choose whether or not to shit on people’s emotions. They don’t feel love and emotion the way we do. They are manipulators. They manipulate us into feeling like we need them and can’t live without them (although we very well can, we are just brainwashed into feeling this way). Trust me when I say I felt every word you wrote in my soul. You need to stay away. Wholeheartedly and fully stay away, for your sanity. You will get sucked in and will ruin yourself completely if you immerse yourself into this cycle any longer. I felt myself changing as well. Hell, I changed a lot actually. I also feel like something went wrong within me after all of this. I’ve lost myself. Lots of people who have been emotionally abused by a narc end up feeling lost, confused, depressed, etc. But I’m now realizing everything. And I’m working on myself. You can do it. I know it’s easier said than done, because like I said I’m in the same situation. If you need to talk PLEASE don’t hesitate to talk to me! I totally understand and it always helps to speak with someone who understands.  Stay strong."

Idk. It’s weird, I really am just trying to understand it all I guess, but maybe I never will. I know there are good people out there but this experience has made me feel like my kindness will never be matched. I’ll try to keep hope, but it’s just so tough. Thank you though ❤️"

I realized this recently, and after reading other posts in this sub and doing research I confirmed it all. I’m not sure why I even bother to try to understand or justify anything he does. He is just miserable and has bad mental health issues so I always kind of let his behavior slide but I shouldn’t have. It doesn’t take away from his narcissistic qualities. You’re 100% correct. Nothing justifies their abuse and there is no logic when it comes to them and their minds. Sigh. It’s so frustrating"
BPD,ew4ircg,t1_ew4bq48,1565111502.0,"You are strong. I hope you can conquer your thoughts and urges to harm yourself. I’m so sorry your girlfriend wasn’t able to deal with it...I think that for people who don’t suffer from mental health issues, they can only handle so much. Sadly it’s too much for them and I can understand why. I’ve lost many people due to my mental health...so many good friends. Ended up in an abusive relationship that worsened my mental health and self harming problem because I didn’t think I deserve better. I hated myself. But I’m slowly coming out of that self hatred coma I was in. I haven’t self harmed in a couple of days now and I’m trying so hard to keep strong.

LifeAfterNarcissism,ew3wqdw,t3_cmn8u7,1565097074.0,"You’re not alone. I’m in the same situation right now. My relationship ended about a week ago and lasted a year, and we were friends for 2 years prior. He was in my life for a long time. He was amazing, until his true colors were revealed. The manipulation, gaslighting, lying, mind games, the list goes on. Caught him talking to tons of women online, exchanging pics, and pretty sure he cheated physically as well, but not confirmed. When I found out who he truly was, he tried to lie his way out and try to convince me he was going to be loyal and work on himself, but nope. He did it again. Then everything ended in a fight- and he has been ignoring me since. Friend told me she saw him on a dating site. He is looking for the next life to ruin. In general, he always made me feel crazy. He barely communicated. I feel like I was in a relationship with a rock. But if I tried to leave, he would throw tantrums and cry and beg. I had a STRONG attachment to him for some reason.

I know exactly how you are feeling. . I feel so low. And I, too used to be so confident and now I feel worthless and disgusting. I feel like an idiot.  That empty, confused, lost, feeling. It’s crazy how people can be so.....horrible. But we will get past this. Things will get better and life will improve. The discomfort we feel right now will only make us stronger in the long run.

My ex was a snapchat sexting addict as well. But he also used other weird “talk to strangers, video chat strangers” type of apps also. It was really devastating for me, every time I would catch him he would do it again. Happened like 6 times over the past year, I couldn’t handle it anymore and we ended up breaking up recently.  It was way too rough on me. 

Hope you get better and can conquer it. Don’t ruin your relationship over sexting. It is not worth it. Use all of your willpower and keep strong. Distract yourself. You can do it"

I think it just hurts a lot regardless though because we’re so used to being around our S/O and just attached to them in general. and the trauma they’ve caused makes it so difficult. I also feel like I’m going to be alone forever now too. I don’t think I’ll ever find anyone else. I don’t even want to at all. Even though he was a narc, I felt like I never connected to anybody the way I did with him. I hate to say that but it’s very true. I just have to stop thinking of the good times and remind myself of the bad times and the emotional agony.

This sub is a blessing for sure. Talking to people who have experienced similar things is comforting...although none of us ever deserved to deal with it, it’s good to know that other people understand the pain."
BPD,ew1vhwa,t3_cmeayz,1565032374.0,"Hi, I’m happy for you. Keep strong. I’m in the same boat. 21, and I’ve been actively self harming for a while, and I JUST got out of a rough relationship with somebody I was extremely in love with.  So afraid to see them with other women...I know that feeling too well right now. But working on yourself and mental state is the most important thing now. The urge to cut is there at every moment but I’ve been trying to resist as well and have been successful for the past few days. You can do it. If you feel the urge to self harm, feel free to message me and talk. Or if you need to talk in general. Stay strong ❤️"
NarcissisticAbuse,ew1v1o7,t3_cmdqxh,1565032087.0,"So proud of you for staying strong and not relapsing and going back. Always trust your gut. You will meet someone later on in life who will wholeheartedly love you and won’t cause you any emotional, or physical abuse. I am only about 5 days free from my narc ex but I know that I will come out stronger from this. You will too. If you ever need to chat feel free to talk to me."
SuicideWatch,ew1uq9t,t3_cm9566,1565031886.0,"This. I haven’t felt “human” in a very long time. If anything, I just feel like a dead person walking. No interests, no hobbies, no friends. Nothing. A waste of oxygen."
NarcissisticAbuse,ew1t0eg,t3_cm8w0x,1565030787.0,"My ex always used the silent treatment. He would stop replying to texts, calls, and in person just send me home no matter how much I’d cry and beg...it’s a very tough thing to deal with. It makes you feel crazy, sad, and low. Please get out and don’t deal with it. Nobody that loves you will put your through that."
NarcissisticAbuse,ew1lr9q,t1_ew1kjt7,1565026164.0,Thank you so much. I hope it does get better. It feels like the end of the world for me right now and I don’t have anyone there for me IRL so It’s very hard...I just need a hug. thank you for this.
