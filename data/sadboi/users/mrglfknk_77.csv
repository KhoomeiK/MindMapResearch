It got stabilized and last month we realized its too low and T3 was also out of range, so i started taking 50 mg 5 times a week and half of the tablet twice a week. This normalized my T3 but not the TSH which is currently 0.18. I will be taking half of 50 mg tablets now 3 times a week."

I used/probably still am like you and I used to eat till I want to vomit and then go on low calorie low carb diets. It helped but I developed a very bad relationship with food where I was afraid eating plain rice because CARBS are poison haha

Now with intermittent fasting and calorie tracking I eat chocolate every day and bread and rice (not all at once) but generally allow myself to eat in moderation and for me it works because my current mindset now is Ok I can eat some pizza today and I can eat some tomorrow and I dont end up eating all of it because I know I can and will eat it again. With binge and restrict it was impossible because after every binge the mindset was - never ever will I eat junk food again.."

My idea of forgiving is strongly related to my punishment by restricting myself too much that eventually leads to giving in. So yeah, if that happens again and I hope it does not, I should just start the next day as usual rather than beating myself up. My goal is to overall „binge less“ and eventually stop rather than counting the consecutive days of no binge because if I do the latter, a relapse will be equal to failure in my head.

I will definitely try treating my binge urges as a thought that comes and goes as you suggested! Thank you!"

CICO,fnkvetc,t3_g29n8m,1587040962.0,"I am also addicted to sugar and what works for me and bare in mind i often end up binging on sweet stuff, is eating low carb. This week I started with low carb foods and then here and there eat some fruit or smth carby but I try to eat 80% of the time low carb so I dont get this hunger cravings that make me eat an entire pack of biscuits and 3 ice creams in 20 min. 


Another thing that works for me is tracking calories, I know that I can eat something sweet if it fits in my daily calorie amount Ive set. 


So I do that I squeeze in maybe a piece of chocolate, make sure I dont go overboard with the calories and eat low carb 80% of the time. 

Hope this helps! Good luck!"
Hypothyroidism,fn5xhlm,t3_fzsoww,1586679398.0,"So I gained 10 kgs when I became hypo. I did Intermittent Fasting mixed with keto/low carb (not 100% but tried to be consistent) and lost the extra weight.

Regarding sports - I figured for me works best when I do shorter workouts so I am consistent. If I go too hard on myself, I will quit altogether. Same goes with food btw. 

So when I went to the gym I did 20 min of cardio and 6 exercises 3 sets each (in total I was in the gym for 40 min). 

Now at home I do 20 min of Yoga with Adrienne and two 10 min workouts of Blogilates on youtube (in total 40 min too).

So currently I don’t always eat healthy (unfortunately!!) but if i eat as above mentioned 70% of the time I am at my “ideal healthy weight”. 

I hope this helps! Good luck! Btw Im also on 50 mg"

Regarding German, on WU premises you’ll be fine only with English. However, around Vienna you might encounter places where English is not very well spoken (rarely though). Vienna has become very international. If you go to villages or outside bigger cities, then yeah you might need German.

relationships,fjxbpdq,t3_ff4ns9,1583666516.0,"Probably mentioned before but it really depends on the culture he comes from. Where I was born and raised (Eastern Europe) everyone pays for their guests and also for example when its your birthday you are expected to invite and pay for the whole party, so same as you are used to. 

However, where I live now(Central Europe) - everyone pays for themselves and it is even considered rude if you don’t accept money from your friends if they come over and suggest they pitch in on the food you bought or ordered. Had cases when people went to the extent to just transfer you money without asking, if they had the bank account. And this is normal here and no one asks questions about it.

I think that you should accept the possibility that everyone has their own view regarding such things.. and probably also respect that.. i think this is not defining him as a bad guy"
