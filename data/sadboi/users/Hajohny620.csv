Ok so if you've been hospitalized you could probably get some legal defense but like you said, you might be turned down since it's kinda expensive.

Talk to your parents, tell them to go to the school cause sometimes the school takes parents more seriously. Kinda give them an ultimatum, say that if proper punishment or actions aren't enforced then you'll leave or file complaints or go to the police. Anything just scare them into action. Be firm. Show them you're not to be messed with. Get some friends to back you up (have them record? Something to get as much evidence as possible)

LifeAdvice,fdfw7da,t3_el2nlf,1578371867.0,"Oh cool, we'll be graduating soon! Anyways I went through what you're going through last year. I had a passion with learning about the body and diseases amongst other stuff (bawcually the medical field). So I kinda just Google searched things like ""jobs that relate to disease"" or ""health professions relating to etc..."". And I found pathology and researched more and more and realized it's what I like. So then I searched (this took a while so be prepared) for all sorts of colleges that have programs and listed them all down. Eventually I was able to narrow down and form a list based on tuition, distance, how good the program is, etc... Then from there you start applying. 

So do that process. Find out what kind of jobs you can do with tech and research a lot. Once you have an idea of what you like, go find some colleges with programs (or you can just look up ""classes to take to become *insert job*""). And ask your guidance counselor If you need help. If yours was useless like mine, ask college friends for help (thankfully I have quite a few). They know so much and I wouldn't have gotten through some of this stuff without them.
