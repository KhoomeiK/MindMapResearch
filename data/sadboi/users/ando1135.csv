Futurology,fqp3tp4,t1_fqossle,1589534032.0,"1. Don‚Äôt know yet whether you will have immunity or if you can still get reinfected.
2. Coronaviruses have been recorded for centuries and it‚Äôs one family of viruses that infects people regularly in the form of some colds (though most common colds are due to rhinoviruses). the difference with this coronavirus is its jump from animals to humans...this transition makes it harder for our immune systems to fight. Covid isn‚Äôt necessarily easy to vaccinate and compared to hiv (the virus that causes aids) it would be easier because the genetic diversity of hiv is vast and it replicates quickly, often replicating into different dominant strains as well as multiple recombinant strains. Basically, it mutates too much to make 1 vaccine useful against all possible strains of the virus. Coronaviruses mutate but not to that extent so a vaccine for that virus would cover more ground, like flu vaccine."
