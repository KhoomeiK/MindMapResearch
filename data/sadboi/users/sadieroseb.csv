offmychest,fnq2a8a,t3_g39x25,1587156322.0,"Wow this is just how I grew up. My mom still tracks me, I‚Äôm a college senior (21f). Unfortunately, unless your parents are physically beating you or depriving you of access to food and water, there‚Äôs not much you can ‚Äúdo‚Äù in terms of legal stuff. They sound pretty controlling, just like my parents. Part of it is that they want to protect you (hence the kidnapping thing), but some parents feel like they don‚Äôt want to draw the line. They say they have a right to know everything, which is not true. I think that it‚Äôs always helpful to be open and honest with parents, but that‚Äôs obviously easier said than done. 

My best advice to you, amidst this coronapocalypse, is to just lay low, keep to yourself in your room. If you can continue to work, great. My mom told me to stop working at Harris Teeter (grocery store) once the virus started escalating. Legally, I don‚Äôt have to listen to her. But because my boyfriend‚Äôs grandparents live with him and I stay over so often, I figured it was in their best interest for me to avoid the virus. I appreciate the work you do as a CNA. I‚Äôm an education major (English for grades 6-12) so I know how it feels to work hard and be constantly criticized and be broke as hell. 

So yeah, I do think your parents are controlling. On a scale of 1-10 (1 being they ignore you 24/7 and 10 being they throw shards of glass from broken bottles at you when you get upset or try to leave the home), I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre in the middle, about average. Doesn‚Äôt mean your parents are not controlling, but I suppose they could be worse. Then again, just because someone else is worse off doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre not allowed to be angry or upset too. If you can, lay low, keep to yourself. Work if you can, spend time on some hobbies you haven‚Äôt done in a while, and try to avoid conflict until you can afford your own apartment. 

Good luck!"
