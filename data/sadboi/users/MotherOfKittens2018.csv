But it‚Äôs probably either some sort of irritation or reaction to something or it could be a yeast infection. Scabies isn‚Äôt the first thing most people think of when they have an itchy rash. Regardless, you should definitely get it looked at!"
medical,fih6svg,t3_f7tarf,1582407065.0,Go to the doctor! It could be scabies if you have any red bumps in the rash

medical,et7tqbu,t3_cacp76,1562537975.0,I get this all the time. I was first told by my doctor is was just muscle spasms and I needed more potassium (basically eat bananas and it will get better) but it actually got worse and started hurting. Via an x-ray we found out I have arthritis in all my fingers and the muscle spasms get more frequent the more I use my hands (mainly handwriting). If you‚Äôre not in pain I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much. But if you are in pain go see a doctor
AskReddit,esi1xuf,t3_c7qrz4,1562005256.0,Not a nurse but more like a nurse‚Äôs assistant (official title was psychiatric technician) but I watched as a patient pulled down her pants and squatted on the floor. I tried talking to her but she just looked up and hissed at me as she proceeded to take a large dump in the middle of the hallway. Psych hospitals always have something interesting happening! Never a dull moment.
