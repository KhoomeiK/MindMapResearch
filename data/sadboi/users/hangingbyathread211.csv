AskWomen,fr1ksza,t3_glj01f,1589821450.0,"From 14-20 I was into that party girl type scene, if that makes sense. I was hooked on heroin by 18 and always dated dudes at least 5 years older than me. 14 dating 21 year olds. And I made a lot of terrible choices later in life. Was pretty openly sexual, had a lot of partners and even ruined others relationship, messed with some other people’s partners that I’m actually still getting backlash for today. That happened 7 years ago and the other 4. It sucks your past can follow you like that but I changed 100% and am the complete opposite of what I was. There’s a lot more factors that go into this but I didn’t want to type a whole story I guess. But only later after I changed I was like, what the fuck was I doing/thinking???? Been clean from all the drugs since 2015 so I guess that’s a plus."
