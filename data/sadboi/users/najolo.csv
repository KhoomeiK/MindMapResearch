AskReddit,fnb1z5l,t3_g0f43a,1586807809.0,"I’m 15 years old and I’m the youngest my brother(the oldest) is so annoying and hurts/bully’s me  and I tell my mom about it but she says it’s not bullying cuz he’s my brother. Here’s some back story. So when I was in middle school my brother was fairly popular and still is popular. He’s been telling everyone lies about me and when we’re home alone he kicks, punches, and shoots me with paint and BB guns. I remember that he burned me and he almost killed me when he tried to drown me. He threatens me by taking out his BB gun and saying he’s gonna shoot me. He tells me to kill myself(and I’m Suicide but he doesn’t know) I’m tired of my family telling me it’s what siblings do. HE BURNS AND SHOOTS ME. I know it’s not serious but I had to vent"
SuicideWatch,fnaysz0,t3_fir9m2,1586806209.0,I know right. Im still pretty young but I’ve told my family and some of my friends about my illness and my family thinks I’m being selfish and they think I’m faking it for attention although I’ve been diagnosed with it
