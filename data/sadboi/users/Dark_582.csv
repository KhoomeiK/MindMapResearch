I made neutral public announcement in my discord server that I'm quitting and stuff. The only ones who knew what I wanted to do really were the brothers and one other friend. (It seems I have lot of friends lol, but really I have only 3 that I can truly open to, still seems good but yeah, nothing is perfect you know. I feel like I can't talk to them about this anymore so much, there's just nothing else to be said. And I feel like I am just begging for help, idk...) Back to ""it"". So, naturally... They freaked out, started questioning whoever could have any lead to my real location (different countries, met thru games). Word got around and soon most of my dc server knows I was suicidal... That night, When I realised, this time I'm too weak and scared to do it... I left my phone on do not disturb for like 4am and only then turned it off. 50+ dms from people who care about me. Then I opened up to the brothers completely, told them about my let's say... Bad coping skills that I used to reduce stress and to be in control of the pain I felt emotionally... Even thou ppl still remembers, some of them already forgot, which is a good thing but yeah. So, to sum it up... My friends know and are helping and helped me more than I could've ever ask for. But... That's about it. I have basically 3 friends that know me, the true me. One of them is depressed and anxious himself, I'm trying to help him as the brothers helped me. And with the bros I'm not talking that much about this shit anymore cuz it seems I got better... Which I believed, till recently. I told him that I am in fact not okay, maybe still from way before, maybe again... Who knows. I said to him that I really should see a therapeutist, he agreed.
