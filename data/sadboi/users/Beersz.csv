And does zma artificially boost testosterone, or just bring it back up to normal levels due to getting the nutrients you need? If I supplement zma will I be sable to stop after everything recovers, if I stop continue nofap? Sorry for the questions I just want to help myself the best. I been flapping multiple times a day since I was 9, and I'm 26 now. I do eat fruit everyday, bannas, pears, apple, yogurt, and oranges."

BPD,ev30419,t3_ci0e0c,1564186790.0,"Oooooh yeah, for me not just relationships but crushes to, but its definitely more agonizing during relationships though. I've been single for 5 years and I've never felt so much peace in my life. I've come to the conclusion that I personally just can't have a relationship. Too much overthinking and anxiety wondering if there male friend is more than just a friend, if there losing interest. It makes me unhealthy. I've never lashed out because deep down I know it isnt true, but the FEELING is still there. I had to be the one to break it off with my previous girlfriend, no fault of hers at all, and it confused her tbh, but I just couldnt take the anxiety anymore. Same if I'm starting to like someone I'll avoid them completely. My life is just better and I'm more confident without all that almost like I never had bpd. Fwbs, cant do it. Onenight stands every now and then though. So I get everything you said, the doubt the questioning your self worth. I again am really sorry I dont have any helpful advice for your situation."
