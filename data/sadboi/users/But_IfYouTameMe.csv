In the UK this organisation would struggle to defend itself in an employment tribunal when asking questions like this in the recruitment process, it’s discrimination. Marital status alone is one of the main protected characteristics, not to mention the questions that are irrelevant to the role and your capabilities. My advice would be to research your discrimination rights according to your country’s jurisdiction. You might also be restricted by how long ago the act of discrimination occurred so best to act fast 👍

You might also want to consider the job might not be the best fit for you if the company already has you feeling violated."
AskReddit,f2zj989,t1_f2zj40t,1570525058.0,Agreed. It’s a common evasion of ownership and pretty damn weak imo.
AmItheAsshole,eyx5evf,t3_cz5vk2,1567545196.0,"You have every right to feel the way you do in this situation. I’m sure you wouldn’t feel nearly as conflicted if your money came from any other means.   

However, you have 2 other resources that are completely yours and could make a big difference to helping a sick child.  

1 - Your time.  

2 - This platform.  

Use the exposure within this post to promote an online fundraiser, including whatever personal contribution you feel comfortable with. This keeps your mother’s legacy in tact and your conscience clear.   

NTA, but please consider how you might feel if something was to happen and you did nothing."

mentalhealth,exc8377,t3_cj6z43,1566145191.0,"What makes this difficult is walking away with the feeling that something terrible is going to happen to them. The words that kept me coming back to a reckless and abusive partner were ‘I’d be dead if it wasn’t for you’ and ‘you’re the only one that can save me from myself’ 

I was very much just the loving mother he never had, and he treated me as such when he left with another woman. 

I’ve now cut ties with him and won’t respond to his attempts to reconnect, although I still dread the day I hear he’s got himself killed during a drink and drug fuelled binge. But I won’t let this stop me moving forward with my own life."
offmychest,ex1irc3,t3_cr3mlq,1565946652.0,"You should know that it’s not your fault you feel this way. There are so many factors in society and culture that encourage this ‘not good enough’ mentality in men as well as women. It’s how the world makes money. 

Young girls especially are exposed to a certain type of pressure from a very young age and social media coming into play over time has just added an abundance of pressure that we didn’t need. 

You’re practicing healthy emotional intelligence by recognising these feelings in yourself and identifying what has caused you to feel the way you do. Unfollowing the girl that triggers these thoughts of self doubt is one step forward to focussing on your own mental wellbeing."
offmychest,ewzzgv8,t3_cqqxq4,1565902833.0,"Your path would’ve went differently if you made different choices 1 year ago, but it might not have been for the better. You could be feeling a similar way somewhere in an alternative universe, only this time regretting not following your passion and feeling resentful towards a relationship that you had a bad feeling about from the start (that’s where my decisions have led me anyway). 

Regret is a horrible thing to deal with, and unfortunately it’s something we all must encounter time and time again. I think as you get older it does get easier to deal with because you get better at identifying the new paths presented before you each day. You become more confident in your own decisions and eventually able to take comfort in ‘what will be, will be’. What you’re feeling now is dreadful, but experiences like this give you the resilience you need to get to that place. 

A girl that does nothing for you now, or a girl you haven’t even met yet, will be the girl that fits into your world so perfectly when the time is right. Your feelings for this girl have grown with time, just think about how your feelings for another girl could grow - maybe even more intensely. 

It’s important to try to avoid comparing your life to the way others have lived, although I know how hard this can be at this stage in your life. And also try not to take your own desired roadmap too seriously, you have so much time to experience the success and romance you’ve always dreamed of. You’ve done incredibly well so far. 

The right girl is out there, and she’s waiting for you to come into her life as much as you’re waiting for her. It would be a shame to throw that away."
