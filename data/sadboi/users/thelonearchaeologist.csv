She told me some people just don’t have an inner monologue, where they cannot hear their own voice as they think!

You’re not alone with work mishap anxiety I have a side gig in a morgue with a drop ceiling. Before my shift ended I needed to mop up some blood, and when filling up the bucket, my fingers slipped on the hose and I shot water up on the drop ceiling. The tiles will definitely stain, and I’m almost positive I’m going to be fired. 

I’m not the most spiritual person, but if there’s one thing I believe 100% in, it’s that everything happens for a reason. After you speak with your manager, I’m sure you will learn from this mistake, and will find better strategies for doing your job, and being present/detail oriented to prevent the same slip up in the future. Don’t catastrophize, that is the least helpful thing. I also like to tell myself “we’ll cross that bridge when we get there” whenever I catch myself thinking up the worst possible outcomes.

(It’s hard to describe but it’s similar to a farm house/barn with high rafters, and  glass ceiling lamps hanging from ropes. There is also a sign inside which says something like “a time long ago, before you and I were born”) 19th to Early 20th century architecture, furniture,  clothing, etc. makes me feel so nostalgic in the same way you described. I even teared up from the sight, at splash freaking mountain of all places! I have yet to experience a past life regression though."
