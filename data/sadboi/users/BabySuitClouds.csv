I also know how much is in his plate with the baby so I donâ€™t want to take away from that either. I guess I feel like I canâ€™t talk to him about serious things or without the whole family knowing about it. 

In a way it comes down to sharing my feelings, probably get yelled at and look like a baby or keep them to myself and just suck it up."

1. My religion teacher taught stuff about philosophy and she showed me that I should question things and think for myself. Iâ€™ve never forgotten it and I feel like itâ€™s made me a more curious person

2. Asshole woman who I have no clue what she did, called me to her office at the end of year 11 and asked me to â€˜leaveâ€™ the school because I wasnâ€™t smart enough to graduate so there was no point staying. Told her to get screwed and transferred to a new school for year 12. I not only graduated but got a decent score, got my vet nursing qualification, am now in uni studying archaeology and I came out of my shell and reinvented myself. I now also have real friends and a crap ton of confidence that I never thought Iâ€™d ever have.  Without her Iâ€™d still be a shy, easily pushed around woman with no high school certificate and still living at home with friends I didnâ€™t like"

You said one girl made her cry, teach her how to deal with these girls and how to be the bigger person. Maybe also sit down and talk with her about how itâ€™s affecting her and how she wants to fix it etc. also keep an eye out for signs of anxiety or depression as bullying can cause this, she might seem fine but if her behaviour changes etc then maybe there might be something else going on."

I donâ€™t get that that â€˜pangâ€™ that I need more. Everyone is different and it can also change too. My mum is an ex-smoker but if someone is smoking around her when sheâ€™s drunk then she might have a draw or two but never any more and sheâ€™s never fallen into that habit again.

I struggle like crazy with accents, I always bring my mum with me to the nail salon because I can never understand what they ask me, no matter how many times I encounter them.
