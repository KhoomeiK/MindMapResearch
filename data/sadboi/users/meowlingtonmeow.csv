Just tell them absolutely everything you menitoned here, don't leave things out if you think they don't matter because they might be important. I went maybe 10 years without a diagnosis and it was only once psychosis happened that anyone realised what was up with me. Also, psychiatrists are more well equipped to diagnose something like schizophrenia than a psychologist or gp in my experience, so it is worth going to see one even if it can be pricey. It was hard beforehand to keep getting the wrong information and diagnosis but I got there and my life is going very well now on medication and with support around me. Good luck!"

I also like to remind him that the paranoid or delusional thoughts I have sometimes are not what I really believe because sometimes they involve him and our relationship, however the stuff I think of in those moments do not represent how I really feel.

Another doctor tried to ""fix"" me with sleeping pills. After all that time the only thing that got me a proper diagnosis was after my first psychosis happened, then it was all clear for them apparently. Just from my experience and what you've said, it sounds like your doctor is trying their best unless something really obvious happens with you which can definitely be frustrating, but it's all they can do unfortunately.

Now I feel empathy for anyone going through mental illness and I don't think they are weak willed or anything like that. I realise that for some and also myself, sometimes just going about the day is a struggle  so I'm far less judgemental now. I also agree with the use of medication if the individual chooses orisadvised to take it.

2. I do have more compassion, but I always did have some especially for schizophrenics. I tend to write more positive things to people now and am more open about my own ferlings and life because it might make someone else feel less alone, and I admire genuity.

3. My relationships with family, partner and friends have more meaning to me now. I'm not hating myself anymore for not being like everybody else, as in once I was diagnosed I knew it was some significant reason why I couldn't do some normal everyday things like get a job and study fulltime.
