This masterclass won't just show you everything about music theory and how to write a song with intricate details. That would be boring as hell. Instead he opens up some of his projects and shows you key points of what he did. 

The class won't show you every aspect of production as that would literally be an endless series.

Edit

Also if u want to learn about music theory go get a book on it or read up on it, there are also plenty of YouTube videos. 

Now judging by what you already posted on your SoundCloud I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you just started to produce music or just started to make music in general. You can't just go out and bash the masterclass because you don't understand half of it..

Music isn't supposed to be some sort of formulaic process, you are supposed to have fun and create what ever comes to mind, wether that be something created by ""dicking around in the piano roll until something sounds good"" or just trying to compose from theory you know. If u are trying to make music some sort of formulaic way then you should re think what music is."

As for the problems at hand aside from that. It would be a good idea to collect yourself. Be mindful in times like this. Think about your situation. Evaluate. 

If I was in your position, I would try to gain full contact of this guy and make sure he sticks around.

I would go to my parents in private of course, and calmly try to approach them, they will likely be a little anxious but it is important to try and keep cool. It would be best to sit them down and discuss what to do and how to move forward.

Now I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say your parents probably won't be to exited to hear that this guy is 5 years older than you. But as your parents they will likely support you. 

If the guy tries to bail on you make sure you have things saved and screenshotted if necessary. If he cuts communication law inforcement will help more than anything.
