BPD,fp528zw,t1_fp4yal7,1588313991.0,Same for me too. Feeling really overwhelmed or stressed seems to be the main trigger
TalkTherapy,fp1qq7v,t3_garl2i,1588244830.0,I remember when I talked about what happened to me and my counsellor after said I had been ‘sexually assaulted’ I struggled for like a week thinking about it. Like I know in my head what happened but I really felt it hard when someone actually said it back to me. I don’t know why. It just did
BPD,fozq5il,t3_gahqxs,1588194925.0,I find getting fresh air helps me with my anger a lot. Going for a long walk or doing some exercise. I hope you’re okay
BPD,fnxlbd4,t3_g4i6nd,1587341020.0,"I totally get your feeling of feeling sensitive. Sometimes someone only has to say hi to me in a different tone and I’ll cry about it for 3 hours! 
Obviously I can’t speak for anyone else but I don’t usually reply to a lot of posts. It’s usually because I often feel the same way and I don’t know how to combat these issues either so I’m often looking for advice and don’t feel like I’m actually able to give a lot back yet. 
I really hope you’re ok. Take some ‘you’ time whilst you’re feeling sensitive. Listen to your favourite happy music or get all cosy in bed and have a sleep or watch your favourite comedy movie! X"
BPD,fnbgjb7,t3_g0puu9,1586815137.0,"Yes and i bloody hate days like this. It’s hard to explain to my boyfriend because I’m not like upset about anything in particular, I just feel so frustrated and angry with everything. Even if I make a cup of tea I can’t even stand there waiting for the kettle to boil because it pisses me off! My only way to get through it is to tell someone I trust that I’m having a really shit mood day but just to leave me to ride it out but also to make sure I don’t do anything too dark."
Showerthoughts,fn2h3gi,t3_fyym3p,1586588778.0,Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter. It doesn’t matter what other movies he’s in I’ll always say ‘yeah it’s got Harry Potter in’
BPDmemes,fn2glsp,t3_fyxkug,1586588280.0,I remember when I was first diagnosed and I didn’t know much about it so I had a google. The first thing I read about it was this article about ‘try not to be scared of people with BPD’ and was this whole article about how crazy people with bpd were. I felt so fucked up after reading that 😂
TalkTherapy,fn0n59c,t3_fyjyby,1586545015.0,I’m currently reading a book which is a lot like this. I think you’ll enjoy it! It’s called The Girl Who Believed In Fairy Tales.
TalkTherapy,fmsm2a0,t3_fx6r4h,1586358085.0,"This was super helpful. I felt like my counsellor was pretty stand-offish during our session today. We usually have a really good connection but I don’t know, something was off. I was debating if to talk to him about it or not in our next session. I can’t help feeling if it was my fault and if I had done something to upset him."
mentalillness,fmiqguw,t3_fuzp4c,1586114840.0,Ugh this really got to me tonight. I always wonder how different my life could have been. I could have carried on being that super happy 7 year old girl and now I’ll never know how her life could have turned out because someone took that all away from me.
TalkTherapy,fkws8jy,t3_fl3bux,1584603588.0,"Oh my god. Were you in my session yesterday because this is exactly what happened with me and my T and how I felt afterwards. I think it’s a universal thing. They’re all stressed and worried about the same things and unfortunately it’s showing in our sessions. They’re only human though and that’s what makes me feel better about my session yesterday. How would I see him if he didn’t seem short and stressed? I would have thought he was emotionless and felt like I was the only one over reacting about this pandemic but at the end of the day, he is just human like me and we’re all trying to get through this together xx"
BPD,fktg5an,t3_fkkf38,1584518291.0,I really hope you’re okay. I had a similar experience. I attempted to take my life and then obviously wasn’t in work for a little while after. I eventually told work the reason why I wasn’t in and I wasn’t allowed back to work until I had a note from my doctor saying I was fit and well to go back to work. My work is ‘really big on mental health’ too but just last week I got in trouble for taking too many mental health days off 🥴
ptsd,fkq9cwt,t3_fk1k3c,1584436242.0,I realised this last week when I got into trouble at work for taking too many mental health days off. It’s really fucked me up since. Just know you’re not alone feeling this way.
AskWomen,fkk7fgl,t3_fiz9ya,1584276124.0,My boyfriend asked me if I wanted anything from the shop and I said no so he didn’t get me anything. I was so pissed off. It was my time of the month so it’s fair to say I was a bit touchy 😂
TalkTherapy,fkikeb0,t1_fkhcapu,1584222087.0,Hope all goes well. Message me if you need anything!
TalkTherapy,fkgu35u,t3_fi8a8r,1584174341.0,"Uk here! There’s no harm to talk to her first about having something you want to talk about but worrying that she might feel the need to transfer you. I think more than likely she’s going to work with you throughout this process but it just might make it that little bit easier to get some reassurance from her before you tell her. If you’re struggling to get the words out then take some time out before your next session and write it all down. My counsellor encourages me to even write things down during sessions and let him read it if I’m struggling to talk about something. 
Even if she does end up transferring you onto someone else, i know it can be really shit but you might even find it easier and more beneficial in the long run to talk to someone who specially specialises in that area. 
I hope all goes well for you! X"
AskWomen,fj7odhe,t3_fbzl1s,1583094721.0,"No rivalry but I moved away, only about an hour from them and ever since it was always me going over to visit them and they would never make the effort to visit me. It got to the point where they didn’t bother so neither did I"
therapy,fj41fu4,t3_fbfxo7,1582998084.0,I think at the time of being in therapy there are so many different emotions and feelings going on that it’s often hard to get across what it is you want to say exactly. I often go away from therapy and think ‘ah I should have said that better’ or ‘I should have said that in a different way’ you could go into the next session and before you start say something like ‘you know you asked last week if I trusted you’ and then tell them how you feel. My therapist knows how much I trust him and I’ve told him so many times that he knows things about me that the closest person to me doesn’t even know and he really appreciates knowing how much trust I have in him.
ptsd,fib76ci,t1_fiatu5f,1582316006.0,Yeah I totally get it. I have them too!
ptsd,fianlit,t3_f7csec,1582304741.0,When I wake up from a nightmare I’ll spend some time doing some grounding techniques and then grab some water and go outside to calm down for 5/10 minutes before going back to bed
therapy,fianae1,t3_f7dwuh,1582304556.0,"I’d maybe go in with the list in terms of your highest priority in what you want to talk about just so the things that are bothering you the most you have a chance to talk about. 
Also bring this up with your therapist at the beginning of your session and go through and list everything that’s on your mind in a summary because then at least you’ve said it and you may feel a little better just getting it out there even if you don’t get round to talking about it that session."
therapy,fi75180,t3_f6v2p2,1582214431.0,I’m not a counsellor or anything but I just wanted to say sorry that happened to your friend. Look after yourself and take care over the next week until you get to see a counsellor.
ptsd,fi6jk8x,t1_fi694ix,1582197838.0,I’m still struggling with this one.. 9 years later 🥺
Anxiety,fhs199t,t3_f4nz2s,1581848775.0,I’d talk to her about the idea of marriage in general first.  I’d also suggest you propose to her somewhere she feels super comfortable and safe. Or somewhere private so she doesn’t feel under pressure by everyone looking at you two waiting for her to answer. Good luck!
Anxiety,fhl7ppt,t3_f3ss72,1581696612.0,"Aw this made me smile. It sounds like you’re doing great! Maybe it’s also the relief that you’ve reached out and are talking to someone about how you’re feeling, which is super positive. Maybe screenshot your post so you have it on your phone and if you have any tricky therapy sessions and are feeling low again, you can bring yourself back to how you were feeling at this time and remind yourself of these good moments. Keep going :)"
therapy,fhl4kw5,t3_f3sqbz,1581695147.0,I’d open up to her and tell her exactly how you’re feeling. It’s completely normal to have a few starter sessions where it all feels a bit abnormal and confusing. Sometimes you just don’t click with your therapist and you need to try a few before you find one you get on with really well. I do think that she will appreciate your honesty though and hopefully you can work through this with her.
ptsd,fhaje1i,t3_f23y2p,1581413535.0,I feel exactly the same. My trauma happened when I was 14 but it always gets to me wondering how different my life could/would be now if that didn’t happen. I think about it a lot
Anxiety,fh0dvnf,t3_f0yrog,1581202870.0,Thank you ❤️
ptsd,fgsnrs3,t1_fgsmmvb,1581088766.0,Ugh I’m so sorry your boss/work is being so shitty. My only other advice is to try and find another therapist which you can click with which maybe have lower rates or availability at times when you don’t have work but also have access to public transport. I even hate that option myself because I know how it feels to have to try and start all over again with someone new. I really hope that this all works out for you soon.
ptsd,fgsm401,t3_f0ae45,1581087688.0,"The NHS waiting lists really do suck. Is there anyway you could make up the 4 hours on a different day to keep your pay? 
It just really doesn’t sit well with me that your private therapy is the only support you’re getting right now and now you’re not going to have any support. How about cutting down to fortnightly sessions? Just so you still have someone there to help you? 
Remember Samaritans are there to call at anytime if you need help or someone to talk to!"
therapy,fgs44lw,t3_ex4a00,1581070622.0,"I’m a bit late to the party, sorry! But I would talk to your boss about it and try and come up with something that works for you both. I have wednesdays off work to have my therapy appointments and make up the hours on the other days I’m in. I wouldn’t be able to just simply go for the therapy session and go back to work because I need time to process it afterwards and some sessions can get quite deep so think about where you’ll want to be after your therapy appointments. If you try and squeeze it in to your lunch hour I’m worried you’ll be rushing around and don’t get time to process what you’ve talked about and how you’re feeling. Would it be a possibility to leave early for your therapy appointments and then make up the hours on a different day or throughout the week?"
ptsd,fgdqhge,t1_fgd0gjc,1580685495.0,Thank you. I really needed that ❤️
