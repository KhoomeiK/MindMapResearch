She started me on 30mg once a day and I definitely feel the effect. I just worry about going overboard with too high a dose. Somebody said they started splitting their dose (per provider orders) into an earlier morning dose and then the other part a little later on in the late morning to help extend the effect but not have to max out dosage so I might bring that idea up and see what my provider thinks about it.  

I've had some of the negative side effects but they do seem to be lessening as the days go on and my body gets used to it. The afternoon crash is getting to me and I really don't like it. I've always had issues with eating. I have the bad habit of forgetting (being too distracted) to eat then going and binging on all the food once I finally snap out of it. It's either that or I'm eating constantly out of boredom/fidgeting. I've started trying to schedule my meals and get better at it but I still kind of suck. 

My husband tries to help as much as he can but he is stretched pretty thin. He is at work more than he is at home with us so that makes life pretty difficult. I've got my parents who occasionally watch them but they're not in great health and can't do it very often or for very long. As far as I know my university doesn't do anything to help financially with childcare, I live almost 10 hours away from campus. The cost of childcare here is nuts, around $20k a year for two kids. 

I did find out my pharmacology book is available in ebook form and has a page reading feature built right into it. It even highlights the words as it reads so that has been really helpful."

If you refuse to work without sufficient equipment, then you're a monster for abandoning your patient, of course. To make themselves feel better about asking nurses to wear one mask for an entire week, storing it in a paper sack, those administrators/organizations run big PR campaigns. They gush about how nurses are heros and indispensable or whatever other bullshit they are spouting. I liken it to a parent making a show out of constantly buying gifts of toys and clothes for a child but then feeding them a few breadcrumbs a day.

Something your husband needs to see. 

Back when I was slogging through my ADN I couldn't work with how much they had us traveling (I live in the middle of nowhere) and time spent in lecture, lab, clinical time etc. We were dead broke. We cut every expense possible, we were on state assistance and even borrowed some money at times to keep afloat. Those were some seriously awful years. There were so many times I looked at what I was doing to my family and wanted to just quit to go get a regular job and help get us in a better place. I didn't and we made it through those 2 painful years and I started working. I got my first RN paycheck and literally burst into tears. It was more money than I'd ever seen on a paycheck. I went back for my BSN online which wasn't nearly as rough so I worked and we were able to get back on our feet and have been doing well. We weren't rich by any means but we were able to be comfortable. I no longer panicked at the thought of a bill coming due. 

For you, this time right now is that sucky part. It's not easy and you're not crazy for questioning why on earth you'd willingly choose it. You have to look at the outcome though. In 1.5 years you'll get that first paycheck and that pressure will start to lift and you'll see these years of struggle as the necessary evil they are. Just hold on, like white knuckling through a scary roller coaster ride. Once you're off the ride you'll be so excited and proud you did it! I hope your husband is just reacting from a place of fear and not genuinely being so unsupported of you. Having the support of my family was the only way I survived and is the only reason I haven't run screaming from this program...and I've come damn close.

I'm currently in school for my DNP and will be specialized as a PNP (hopefully). My clinical time begins next Spring but I doubt I will be able to continue working as an RN. I only do per diem right now so maybe, possibly, I could keep the job because the per diem gives me a ton of flexibility but it isn't making us a boat load of cash. My advisors have all said maintaining any sort of job is almost impossible. Look into any sort of unemployment type assistance that might be offered in your state. Some places do special circumstances for students. 

I've wanted to quit too. This program has nearly broken me. I have massive loan debt that haunts my dreams though, right now I'm at $138k and will be looking at around $190k by the end of it all if my math is right. I try not to think about that. A PNP in my area should make enough to be able to handle that fairly well (I hope). 

NPs are always in demand somewhere. You may have to move to get a job if your area is saturated but there is no shortage of places which have a high demand. There are some awesome loan forgiveness programs through the government too. They involve certain criteria but its worth a shot. There is one I can't remember the name of but it is only for high level degrees like DNP or PhD. 

Right now it is so hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel but it's there and it's coming. Its not a train either. Stick with it and you'll be proud and happy you did. Walk away and you never know what you could have done. You're so so so close. Don't give up hope yet. You're chasing a better, secure, future for your family and that's nothing to be ashamed of."

I wear Disney shirts and jean shorts 99% of the time. The other 1% is Disney dresses. I have a big collection of Disney stuffed animals on my wall next to my bed. People think that ones double weird. I behave just as if the characters at Disneyland are real and on special event nights I get fully dressed up in costume and love every second of it. I love making Disney costumes too. 

I'm also super into gross/morbid/bizarre stuff. Probably part of why I became a nurse. The more crazy/gruesome a medical condition the more interested I am.

I'm not at my heaviest anymore but I'm still heavier than I want to be and not happy with where I'm at physically so I catch myself in a ton of negative self talk.  

So. You and me, positive thoughts. Go look in the mirror and say 3 thing that are awesome about you, and there are way more than 3 but start small. Say them out loud to yourself, I'm serious! I don't care if it's that you like the way your big toe looks, just don't allow yourself to go negative. Stay on positives. 

For me I look in the mirror and my three positive things are I have a really pretty color of blueish gray eyes that I love, I like my long torso which suits my short legs and I like my hair because it is super crazy thick and a pretty shade of red right now. 

Now. Your husband sounds super awesome and supportive, he's a keeper. I bet you a hundred bucks he can come up with at least 10 things he loves in about 5 seconds. Ask him! Tell him your struggling to see yourself positively and need his help, ask him to name 3 positive things he sees about you and this is really hard but believe him!! 
My husband compliments my butt all the time, it's his favorite part of me. Yet...all I see is an overflowing sack of lard. He sees it as beautiful and sexy and he means that! 

It's so easy to see the positive in others and not yourself but so so so sooooo hard to stop doing it. Positive outlook goes a long way in success with weight loss, negative leads to that whole ""whats the point I give up"" outlook but ya know what? You are worth more than that! Much more. 

If you ever want a buddy to help keep you accountable, bounce ideas off of, or just hear your struggle I'm always happy to listen. Losing weight is so very hard but every failure is  progress, it is one step closer to success, no matter if it is a million failures what matters is you are still trying and don't get discouraged just because something didn't work.

If so I'd probably lean towards just him having a hard time and being in that literal mindset, getting hung up on that detail which to his brain is very important, but to your brain the meaning is what's important. From what little interaction I've had with some high functioning ASD persons, they seem to get very focused on small details that don't seem to matter to me but it's a big deal to them and neither of us can figure out why the other sees it that way because our brains are wired differently. When we get flustered and angry people tend to really cement themselves in and refuse to budge in their way of thinking which usually escalates the issue unfortunately.

If this is a regular type of thing...maybe more of a gaslighting situation going on. Or he is just being a dick.  

Once everybody is calmed down maybe talk about how the literal words weren't what was important to you and explain you wanted to express how his words made you feel/how you interpreted them."

As for hygiene unless the woman has a blood borne disease like HIV there isn't anything really to worry about.

I don't have issues with my feet but that little hunk of flesh may or may not come back, it isn't a huge piece but it isn't small either. It will probably look kinda weird but my pinky toe always did so no biggie. Now if I can keep my kids from leaving  their toys out for klutzy me to trip over, that'd be great."
