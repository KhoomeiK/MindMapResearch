CompetitiveTFT,fmvelr4,t1_fmv9ido,1586414324.0,"fast 8 usually means lvl to 8 at 4-3, but if you are streaking hard sometimes u can lvl 8 at 4-1.  it's situational about how much gold you need to have left over, but most times u dont want to have <10 gold. Most games that you econ correctly (not a reroll comp) you should be able to push 8 at 4-3, with 20g+ to spare. About rerolling past 8, it depends on your comp and health. 

tldr: fast-8 means prioritize lvling before that stage, and dont reroll too much (if u are stable enough)"

maschine,fgf1jn0,t3_ey2onu,1580719409.0,"Not exactly sure what you're asking, but if you have a sample loaded in audio mode you can change it from loop to ""gate."" Anytime you hold the pad down, it will play the part of the loop that is ""locked-in"" to that part of the sequence like you mentioned. So it's like you are muting part of the loop at parts, or just letting part of the loop play when you want. Hope that helps."

LofiHipHop,fdm134d,t3_em2inu,1578537295.0,"could be aggressive compression triggering between two of the synths/samples, but I think it might just be choke groups. So when synth B gets triggered, certain other synths/samples just get cut off."
maschine,fdhnh6c,t3_elggn6,1578426375.0,"I don't know what you mean by the second question, but for the first thing: if you mean you chop up more than 16 things like [this](https://imgur.com/a/fndhLbN) and apply it, and then want to access more than those first 16 chops, just change the root note you are on. Because it will chop it up, and assign it to one pad, things get chromatically assigned to individuals notes essentially. So similar to what you would do for an instrument, you just scroll up an octave on the maschine, to reach the later sample chops."
makinghiphop,fdbztgz,t1_fdbyofn,1578264459.0,".wav files are higher quality so generally when making music that's what you would want to be working with, (converting an mp3 to wav won't up the quality either, so try to download things as wav files in the future as a quick tip)

once you have your sounds loaded go to the software and click the [16-pad icon](https://imgur.com/a/O5kwwH2).

Then click each pad, and then individually change the [choke group to 1](https://imgur.com/a/ggeE0H8) here.

Do that for each pad, and you should be good to go.

EDIT: i would also check out r/maschine for other maschine questions"
makinghiphop,fdby9a2,t1_fdbtd8a,1578263739.0,"ADSR stands for attack, decay, sustain, release mode. In 1-shot mode everytime you hit the pad, it plays the entire sound there, ADSR instead plays an envelope of the sound. (think, holding the pad of a long sample, and when you let it go it stops, even though there is more of the sample)"
makinghiphop,fdbx6iy,t3_ekj4cl,1578263322.0,"Hey, so the polyphony voice trick works if it is one sound within a group, but it sounds like you are working with multiple sounds within a group. In this case what you are looking for  is to create [choke groups](https://imgur.com/a/6Mti3Yk). So if you want every pad in the group to cut each other off, assign every pad to choke group 1 as a master.  (A slave in the group will not cut off other pad's sounds in the choke group if triggered, but its sound will get cut off by a master)

Hope that helps, let me know if you have any questions"

I then change the audio back to sampler mode, and then I time stretch the sample, in sampler mode. Make sure you turn of Auto-Bpm, and manually put the bpm you found before in. Then you can chop up the samples the way you like.

Personally, I used to do a lot of truncating, but lately I like to begin with the ""detect"" slice mode messing with the sensitivity to get an idea of what parts I actually want to chop.

Hope that made sense."
