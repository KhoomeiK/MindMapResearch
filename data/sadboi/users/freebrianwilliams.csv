Usually I can avoid living w him but I can‚Äôt now. That‚Äôs not his fault per se but it‚Äôs my experience. Because of the virus I‚Äôve spent 2 months w him, way more than I have in a long long time, and it‚Äôs straining my mental health. That‚Äôs not his fault per se but he is ‚Äúcausing it‚Äù. He is struggling and the solution is available but he won‚Äôt go  and instead leans on me for support I‚Äôm not capable of providing. so it‚Äôs hard not to get upset.

I am not emotionally equipped to deal with a suicidal older Brother and it‚Äôs really really hard, especially since he has admitted to being abusive in the past.
