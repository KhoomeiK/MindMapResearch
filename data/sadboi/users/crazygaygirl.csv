AskReddit,fbs73q0,t3_ee2ps8,1577051165.0,"My earliest memory is probably being sung to before bed. There were two songs that were sung both were these Christian prayer songs and I can remember them clearly. (I consider myself Christian because I believe in god and Jesus, but I am a lesbian woman, and so I have a lot of issues with institutionalized religion, the songs went something like “Jesus tender shepherd here me, bless thy little lamb tonight. I’m thy pleasant pastures lead me, keep me safe till morning light. All this day thy hand has led me, and I thank thee for thy care. Thou hast warmed and clothed and fed me. Listen to my evening prayer. Amen” and the other one was “long ago, there was born in the city of David, a sweet little baby, it was Jesus our lord. Angels sang. At his birth. Lullaby peace on earth” I don’t know if anyone else was sung these as children but this memory is entangled with my childhood, and despite my problems with religion, and really it’s problems with me, these memory are still pleasant."

AskReddit,fbmm35g,t3_edybz2,1576985820.0,"Ok so I go to a school in the south but not like the rich south. So we have a lot of interesting rules at our school, but probably the most bullshit rule is that we are not aloud to wear anything on our heads. (Religious reasons not included) while it isn’t always followed it goes about like this. No hats, no headbands, no bandanas, no dorags, no big hair clips. Like nothing. On our heads. Like what is the point?? How are we gonna fit a weapon into a quarter inch solid plastic headband?"
