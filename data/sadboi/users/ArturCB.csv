As a matter of fact, they are some of the most evidence based, data driven and statistically validy instruments in psychology. So i have to ask, why would think they are ""outdated"" ?"
gameideas,fke2u1e,t1_fke1yit,1584103685.0,"I mean... that obviously depends on how you think about intelligence, but im aware that most psychological intelligence theories posit the existence of a Gerenal form of intelligence. Iam also aware, however, that IQ tests are relative to a specific population, wich means they are only as good as the method of statistical analysis used to make them. Internet IQ tests are stupid for sure, but if i can make something that correlates well with an already utilized psychological scale that measure intelligence and take a big sample size to normatize my findings, i dont see what could go wrong - even if IQ is such a controversial topic."
gameideas,fke1itg,t1_fke0vtz,1584102635.0,"Oh yes, ive seen at least half of this video before and, correct me if im wrong, but i believe that the main concern presented regarding IQ was primarily directed towards the ethics behind the creation and the use of IQ rather then the actual validity of the construct"

psychoanalysis,f60xa87,t1_f60rknl,1572628148.0,"I recommend you read ""the unconscious"" freud's 1915 paper, for better clarification on the subject."
psychoanalysis,f60wv08,t1_f60rknl,1572627869.0,"The whole process is a bit more complex, but for the most part you got it. 

Usually, it starts with an internal or external arousal such a hunger or a very beautiful woman. From this arousal you get tension and from this tension you get the drive - the drive is a powerfull force that you experience as the necessity to relief tension. In order for the drive to be satisfied you have to mentally created a scene in wich that can happen so that you can act out that scene - thats the fantasy. The fantasy is created based on previous unconscious memories and based on other unconscious fantasies. If the fantasy is unaceptable it will be repressed wich in turn is going to increase the force of the drive associated with that fantasy. The rest is as you already understood it.

On the subject of dislocation and condensation, in freud's theory they are a intrinsical part of how the unconcious functions and thats why they are present in almost every process that involves the unconscious in some way: dreams, the creation of symptoms and also the cure."
psychoanalysis,f5r4j21,t1_f5r1hmf,1572387963.0,"However, tradicionally speaking, the symptom disappears because the unconscious fantasy that fed the symptom found a way to make itself known, present and conscious. Unconscious content wishs to be made conscious, but when denied this privilege it has to force itself onto the conscious mind through a diferent path then that of ""cognitive thinking"" or emotinal realization. The longer a fantasy is repressed the more psychic energy it musters, it gets to a point where that energy becomes too much for our ego to handle and so the symptom is created as a way to protect the conscious mind of the unconscious fantasy and, at the same time, as a way to make use of the energy that is conected to the fantasy. When the fantasy becomes conscious the amount of energy that was attached to it - and that caused the need for the symptom in the first place - can be redirected towards other things through condesation, dislocation and sublimation. Thats how you get cured"
psychoanalysis,f5r1hmf,t3_dow7jn,1572386539.0,"It doesn't. Freud's later work proposes that simply making the cause of the symptom conscious doesnt make it go away. That's because of the compulsion to repetion and the death instinct. In this direction, try to think of psychoanalisys as a form of treatment that facilitates change through a process of self reflection and descovery. Althought the origin of psychoanalysis is related to the search for a cure to hysteria, it is no longer the case that psychoanalysts attempts to cure symptoms - for the most part. Freud himself, in his later work, thinks of psychoanalysis as a tool for aquiring knowledge about ones own unconscious fantasis and desires, not as cure. Psychoanalysis can relief symptoms for sure, there are some meta analysis that point in this direction. But thats not the goal of the psychoanalytic process, thats merely a consequence."
mentalillness,f0tffnb,t3_d6g9qo,1568921160.0,"Do you take medication? If so, does it hinder your capacity to create? Do your drawings aliviate in any way the intensity of your symptons?"
psychology,f0h64kf,t1_f0h4h8m,1568613802.0,"Well, no one person can be diagnosticated because of a single event. A depressed person is depressed for a long period of time, however the symptons of depression are very normal behaviours that humans normally exhibit from time to time. The pathology happens when those symptons are constantly present. 
Now, apply the same logic to criminal behaviour. Its a single event, therefore it can't be indicative of a pathology by itself (it could be the result of a personality disorder, but it could also not be). Some people have allucinations once or twice in their lifetime, but that is not enough to classify them as schizophrenics.
Human behaviour is very volatile and strange sometimes, but it can only be classified as pathological if it's persistently strange."
psychology,f0gxklj,t1_f0gcrxc,1568608351.0,"Yes, we accept it as normal in the sense that it isn't indicative of a pathology. ""Normal"" people are violent, humans are violent. It refers more to a particular personality type than to a pathology."
