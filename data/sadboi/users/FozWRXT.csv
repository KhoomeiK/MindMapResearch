cars,fpzy7p9,t3_gfwfby,1589025440.0,"2016 Focus RS. I’ve gone through 4 head gaskets, two heads, a damaged block, and over two months in the shop in the last year. All of those issues happened when stock. I’m currently pushing close to 400 horsepower to the wheels and it’s never run better and I’m still using the factory clutch with no problem.

progresspics,fh17idk,t1_fh15owx,1581211763.0,"Well my fiancé cheated on me so I started off by not eating anything for two weeks. I also needed something to do and a reason to get out of the house so I went to the gym twice a day for about a month. Once I was saw some results I wanted to make fundamental changes to how I lived so I cut out 90% of the processed foods I ate, no processed sugars at all, stopped eating pizza and eating out in general. Cut out coffee for tea only because coffee just makes me want to sweeten it. 

I started out doing cardio and basic free weights and leg workouts. I couldn’t do a mile in under 15. I just ran a 5k last weekend in 29 minutes so my endurance has been my biggest improvement. Currently I eat a good sized salad for lunch and my dinners are mostly either organic seafood or poultry based. My portions are much smaller and my appetite is much more controlled."
