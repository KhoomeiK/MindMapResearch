BPD,fqwbqz3,t3_gl5zt4,1589698876.0,"Edit: at first, I was really pissed off for you. So many mediocre therapists think they can help anyone and then realize, after they've wasted plenty of your time and money, that they are underqualified. But then, I saw the last part of your post where you mention that he's a DBT therapist. Now, if he's a DBT therapist, are your sessions focused on DBT? Or just someone who claims to have knowledge of DBT in addition to other psychoanalytic schools? Now, please take what I say with a grain of salt, I'm obviously not there in your sessions but this is something to consider: The reason I ask what you mean by ""DBT therapist"" is because true DBT therapy isn't typical talk therapy. Their job isn't to be a sounding board but to teach you practical skills. If you are doing a lot of rehashing of the same non-traumatic scenes in your sessions, it may be interrupting the work that your therapist is trying to do with you. My DBT therapist often cuts off stories I am telling and I am grateful for that because it's a waste of my money to fill up the timeslot with stories when I'm really there to learn and practice skills. She asks for enough information in order to help me work through the particular problem that is plaguing my life right now and doesn't need all the extraneous details that a talk therapist may encourage out of me. That doesn't mean it doesn't get emotional. We hit triggers and sore spots, but then we work through them in the most practical sense. I bring the DBT skills workbook to my sessions and she marks in it, bookmarks, goes to the whiteboard. It's NOT talk therapy. When you get into the PET part of DBT therapy, you will be able to rehash traumatic events in excruciating detail as much as you need but they don't begin that until you've learned basic DBT skills, just to keep you safe.
All that said, my therapist seems to have a gift for keeping things on track and not getting inundated by details and redundant patterns--patterns are precisely the reason why people need therapy. If your therapist isn't able to help get you out of this loop, maybe the other commenters are right about it not being a good fit."

Honestly, I believe you that the way you have used people wasn't healthy or ethical, but at the end of the day, we all need something from other people. Anyway, it doesn't sound like NPD. I was in a very similar boat where I have an NPD parent and they create such a toxic, invalidating environment that you can't help but internalize their problems and become to believe that you are a spitting image of them. You have been so invalidated that you don't know who is right and who is wrong during conflicts (obvs it's usually not a clear line, but u probably know what I'm talking about). You have been so invalidated that her voice telling you that there's something wrong with you over the silliest, stupidest things has become so internalized that it's a core part of you.

He has congratulated me in the past and the reason why i say he might have agreed with me if I worded it that way is that he actually values an honest days work. That doesn't mean that I can prevent all explosions from him and you're right, maybe me simply disagreeing, no matter what angle I take is shaky territory, but I still feel that there's usually an angle, it just takes a lot of pain and failed attempts to find that angle. When I was younger, it was to cry or be suicidal (well, he actually said, ""I bet you regret that suicide note"" when I was in the hospital...) now I am discovering other tactics and routes.

You can't put all your eggs in one basket in terms of where you draw fulfillment.

Your friend sounds like a good person AND it's still possible that they have struggled with a non-severe case of NPD. 2. Sure, everyone has their coping mechanisms. The NPD diagnosis describes a particular set of traits (aka coping mechanisms) that occur as a recognizable pattern in some people.

Psoriasis,fk8zmjd,t1_fk8l6by,1583965865.0,"TL;DR:
Natural Factors is my fave so far. Stay away from NOW."
Psoriasis,fk8zjrb,t1_fk8l6by,1583965823.0,"I used to only trust Natural Factors, (buying the Nature's Answer tincture when I couldn't score Natural Factors), but recently I tried Jarrow Formulas since it was on sale, and it seems to be doing okay, but I will probably switch back to Natural Factors since they include dandelion which also helps with detoxification and I legit noticed a huge difference between when I was and wasn't using it.
I don't remember if I've tried Gaia Herbs but they are a high quality brand and theirs is probably legit.
NOW did not work for me. 
I found an article online that claims that 80% of milk thistle supplements are worthless because they use an improper extraction. Silymarin, the active compound, has to be extracted using a either 2-part process of defatting and extracting using an alcohol or Pressurized Liquid Extraction and not everyone trying to make money off the product knows this (or cares). Turns out our guts are pretty effective at extracting this compound and throwing milk thistle seeds onto salads will also add silymarin to your diet (which actually doesn't taste bad, full of protein, and you can find them at Natural Grocers or online). 

As for whether milk thistle can harm your liver over time (I know you didn't ask, but I feel it only responsible to address this), I have yet to find any studies that show deleterious affects. Everything points to the health benefits. Doesn't mean they don't exist. However, I have noticed that too much can be too ""cooling"" and I'm more likely to get some sort of infection if I'm taking a lot during the winter. But prescrip meds for psoriasis also increase risk of infection. Makes sense when you think of it in terms of an autoimmune problem."

funny,fk64ifl,t3_fgoaoj,1583893537.0,I would feel bad to upvote this one. That looked painful.
IAmA,fk1r2dh,t3_ffdd8h,1583785160.0,What are your bestselling scenarios/plots?
NPD,fjyg0bj,t1_fjyfhjg,1583695934.0,Thanks for sharing. Yes I can relate to the sudden realization that it can't always be the other person's fault.
NPD,fjyfrhg,t1_fjxbcs8,1583695780.0,"Thanks for sharing. What led up to the diagnosis - did you go in for depression or anxiety and end up with an NPD diagnosis? I have looked into comorbid AVPD, I've been a lot more of a recluse the last several years, after having so much interpersonal stress with coworkers and in relationships, I couldn't make heads or tails of who was right and who was wrong anymore and was constantly ruminating on painful interactions."
funny,fjy5xjo,t3_ff7yoj,1583690470.0,She ready!
funny,fjy5kbx,t3_ffckam,1583690270.0,I get it back later.
NPD,fjx3030,t1_fjx1gwz,1583654368.0,"Thanks! It was hard to share a lot of these thoughts since I know that a lot of what I had to say might feel invalidating or dismissive to some, or maybe just naive. But the input from other redditors in the comments adds to what I had to say and also challenges it."
