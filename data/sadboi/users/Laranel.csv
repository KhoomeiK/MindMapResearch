PennyDreadful,fl362gz,t3_flp06o,1584770090.0,"As far as a cursed female protagonist, I'd go with the anime Le Chevalier D'eon.

Taking place in France during the reign Louis XV, D'eon a knight of the king finds his dead sister, Lia,  floating in a coffin with a single word written, 'psalms'.

He decides to pursue and comes across some occult alchemy and withcraft.

After being attacked by one of the alchemical creatures D'eon feels his life slipping away.

Then his sister's soul takes over his body to enact revenge.

And that's the first episode.


It's historical fiction, but D'eon existed in real life. 
He was said to spent the first half of his life a man, and the second a woman.

Religious themes, occult and supernatural make this an interesting series.

It's easy to jump in multiplayer and start hacking away but not going through the solo mission may leave you with limited resources and a lackluster kitchen. 
However, Capcom has several free item packs that will be very helpful.

Multiplayer is all about clearing ""key quests"" that will unlock the urgent to rank up. The clear (for the urgent quest) will only go to the person that posted it, though. So expect some grinding. 

There's also plenty of Event Quests for unique crossover gear. 

Before making a decision I'd watch some gameplay or full hunts.
