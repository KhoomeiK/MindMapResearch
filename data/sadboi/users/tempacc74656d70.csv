Well that's the entire point. Read ""Industrial society and its Future"" by Ted Kaczynski. It might give you an idea about what to do."

It does not have to be of the same type, just something that puts another girl in the same boat with society. I know it sounds rough and it is, but life sucks."

So we got to eat pizza together, she went to shower and came to my room, she was wearing that dress from few days before, no bra just the dress and her panties!This time, things got clear, we sat near each others, we talked a lot, she asked me if i had a gf or ever had a gf (said I don't). I asked if she had a bf, she said no. She sat in front of me cross legged. Her beautiful thighs were just there in front of me. While we were eating, she had a towel on her legs, and then she started ""scratching"" ... she literally removed the entire dress and only the towel was covering her crouch!, I literally saw her white panties! even a socially awkward and veteran introvert like me knew this wasn't normal!!

my door was opened, our other neighbour got out and interrupted us. So she stopped and slowly put the dress back. She, as me, seemed a bit annoyed by our 3rd neighbour ... after 15 minutes waiting ... she went back to her room to bring her laptop and when she came back she pushed my room's door quietly. It was almost closed. now our neighbour didn't have sight on us ...

so things went on, she showed me her shoulders twice ""like moving her hand in to scratch etc ...""  and we kept talking. We then talked about getting a new room, she showed me the rooms she applied for and told me that she got a meeting to view them but was scared to go, she then asked me if I would like to get a room with her in the same new house. I said sure. When it got late she told me she was gonna go in 15 mins ... after sometime she left ...

So me, my stupid ass, given all the above decided that she is interested in me, while we were cleaning the food and all, I asked her if she wanted to go out, she replied: ""sure, but i don't know i am busy rn""...me, my confidence dropping back to an unidentified negative value, told her ok then good night and went back to my room.

I only once in my entire life told a girl that I like her and wanted to go out with her and she rejected me brutally, and now , 7 years later, after finally getting the courage back to ask a girl out, this happens ... I honestly wish i never existed ...  


Edit: I mean my guess is that, if all she wanted was to have fun for one night, what was I supposed to do, ask her ""wanna sleep together!!"", duh, please shot me ..."

relationships,fb8odr4,t1_fb09dy6,1576618254.0,"Hi, Sorry to bother you again.   (made you some upvotes as a thank you!)So on last Sunday when she came back I left my door half open. She came by just after she arrived and we exchanged greetings, then the next thing she said was that we should eat pizza again this week... I said sure.

Monday:

We met on Monday again, she had her door wide open (we went home at the same time). My other neighbour was there as well, so I kinda kept my distance "" I don't function at all when there is a lot of people"". she was texting in her phone for a long time, but later asked if I had a pizza, I said no...Later She told me she has a presentation on Tuesday (today), and she's gonna close the door so she can concentrate. I told her good luck with you pres. and our interaction ended.

Tuesday:I met her later when I came home. we talked for a while, she wore a dress that was just above the knees. Don't remember ever seeing her in one. She had a ""facemask"" on that she told me she do once a week for her skin ... we talked about our day for a bit, she told me she can't find a new room (we have to leave by end of March)... and that she wants a place where the neighbours are good, and that student dormitories are crowed and not good. she told me that she wants someone she can eat pizza with... etc.

I asked her what she was going to do in the rest of the day, first she said nothing, but then she went on and said she had to study for something. I then invited her if she wants to watch netflix together, but she declined and said she does not have time.  but told me we can watch a movie or something after we return back from the christmas holidays ""she asked when I was gonna leave and return"". turned our we gonna return on the same day. She told me that she was gonna study on the christmas break so she won't have to cram before exams (feb). that's when she told me that she would have time to watch something on netflix.

**Important Note:**Yesterday she spent around an entire hour in the bathroom, today also she took some long time ...I have 0 experience in this, but could she has her period and that's why she wore that dress ??

Do you think I am overthinking this and this is just normal, or you think she's maybe interested ?"

The thing is, the way she acts around me, I am not sure if that how girls normally act or not. That's why I am asking."
