Anxiety,fnargnp,t3_g0ging,1586802518.0,"I just responded to one of these yesterday relating the same thing. 

My opinion, which has also been shared for many of us here, is that you must make up your mind and find out as soon as possible how to schedule your time. Make a schedule! No joke.

For example, tomorrow morning: From 9:00 am to 9:30 am breakfast

From 9:45 to 12:00 am take notes of the classes i haven't attended recently.

Afternoon:

From 16:00 to 17:00 pm do some sport

From 17:30 to 20:00 pm start doing this or that project 

&#x200B;

This will be my planning for tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

As long as you're loyal to the schedule you make up, you're gonna have the feeling that everything is going on the right direction and you won't stress yourself to these levels... keep it easy."

Anxiety,fn7zagf,t1_fn7jiit,1586730657.0,"woops! as a former weed smoker, I don‚Äôt recommend anyone out there coping with anxiety to smoke pot. it can make you relax in the best cases, but in general, anxious people would probably have several bad trips on weed! panic attacks as you said you experienced, depersonalization, etc. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it, there are wagonloads of other alternatives which are better in these cases."
Anxiety,fn7yemx,t3_g02gqq,1586730139.0,"same here. every time I feel like i‚Äôm kinda getting rejected for any reason or I barely see others looking awkwardly at me I start to behave in a very dumb way and it‚Äôs amazingly rare. i just freak out throughout my insides but i seem partially normal from an outside viewpoint. 
this really harms my self-esteem and a good day can transform into a sorrow, blue one just in one single second; I‚Äôve indeed tried to make up my mind but it never completely goes away... 
anxiety turns into low self-caring, and this low self-caring turns likewise into sadness and laziness. it gets way harder every time"

StonerPhilosophy,fgsw33m,t3_f0bc3r,1581093859.0,"the 5th of january I suffered a famously called irrealitation episode induced by cannabis. i felt how my body had lost all sensitiveness and it felt like a small feather. i wasn‚Äôt aware about who I was and who my parents were. I just looked at them as if they were some kind of entities with no soul in them, just something that existed necessarily. i really remember telling myself that i was probably going to die but it was ok, because it wasn‚Äôt a big deal anyways... 

even though it‚Äôs been over a month now, I still feel those syptoms whenever the situation comes up to my mind. in fact, I strongly share your point... I really believe this has to have more sense than it commonly has. Psychiatric and psychologist keep refusing this spiritual statement, If you wanna called like this. 

When I went to the hospital, the psychiatrist told me this was totally common when induced by cannabis, that nothing else bad was going to happen to me as long as i never smoke weed again. ‚Äúthat wasn‚Äôt the real reality, so don‚Äôt worry‚Äù

it got me thinking... then, how do we know what is the true reality? how can we know which reality is fake and which is true? wasn‚Äôt that episode I had something of a bigger matter, spiritual, conection with some sort of God, maybe?


So many questions about this. Thanks for sharing your comment."
