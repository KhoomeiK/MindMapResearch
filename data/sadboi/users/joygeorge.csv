Totally. Get. This. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I have the realization yet I am a free spirit so its super challenging to create this highly linear thing! and I haven't mastered it yet
I am working toward giving myself a flexible schedule with some unstructured times so it feels
 do able - I really need a good accountability partner I believe that would help and haven't found one
Too bad we can't be accountability people for each other cuz we get it - the bipolar stuff"
bipolar,f804cbd,t3_dya9rq,1574120681.0,"I am trying Vraylar too - when I was in a really long down I was given Cymbalta and it pulled me out- I still take it years later its more than an SSRI it hits more receptors I believe 
Anyways yes ask your Dr about Cymbalta"
bipolar,f7wvozt,t3_dxivct,1574039326.0,"I love this post! Its encouraging!

I am 50 but still on my journey to mastering self care for stability. It does take time and lots of effort and powering through!

You sound like me in many ways! 

Keep up all the good work"

BipolarReddit,f71vtqk,t1_f70xu2i,1573349220.0,"I do agree I think OCD and collecting too much are related and its that thinking "" we may need it later "" 
Also I need to be able to do it - organizing, letting go,
etc in a ""certain way "" also I tend to want to do the whole process black and white ... complex huh?

Do you notice the stuff and clutter more when you are down?
Well, at least you do get rid of stuff when you flip or flop haha doesn't sound as much like hoarding as 
mixed states lol about it haha xo"
bipolar,f6y8clj,t3_dtns1t,1573270800.0,"O.m.Dear God! 

First of all - praying for you my hurting friend!
 I agree with other threads - try to get a fish or animal? If possible if you can keep it together enough if not its OK! 
Also agree call a crisis line and don't say suicide say self harm 
And I realize you can't afford hospital but if its emergency for going in patient insurance should have to cover it?! If you need to go you need to go!
Your life is worth it!!!

I feel your pain and can not imagine it because its sounds even more intense than I have   but I do go through similar depressive episodes ..

Is there anyone support group in your community for mental illness? Please go...

Do you a support person to stay with who will let you come over for a few days for safety and comfortable who can share their space so you are not alone

You are not alone on here we care and as I said I am praying for you..

Giant hugs to you!!! Hang on please try to get support its out there ...xo"
bipolar,f6y6yxw,t3_dtpj8j,1573269590.0,"I.get.this.
And it is hard to explain!!!

I really think it sucks but the best way to manage it - I believe is self awareness and monitor this and if you can catch the depressive coming on quick- adjust meds... increase them? 

I am still working on learning to manage it all myself
It has been years of work - feeling close to getting meds right!  And things can and do trigger stuff for sure! 

I hope this matter balances out for you - bipolar can be so so so hard for us and on us! 

Hope this helps a little..."
bipolar,f6y6hsb,t3_dtigxn,1573269163.0,Go up !!! Talk to your Dr asap =not worth the depression and crying if you can adjust meds

So I have roooomSss full ðŸ˜¯

I bet that makes you feel much better lol

That you just have one room full and one year

Can you imagine a whole house and at least 10 years or more of a struggle ..."
BipolarReddit,f6y2j0f,t1_f6y0nif,1573265713.0,"That's how I have accumulated stuff too- in hypo mania! Plus I have kids and their stuff and I have OCD and I collect stuff that I think I really need at the time but really don't 

I also hate cleaning cuz of too much everywhere and 
This is a huge burden as I want the house clean and orderly and de cluttered so this always causes part of depressive cycles if that makes sense 

Thanks for sharing and being honest as I don't feel so alone because you responded 
My home was really getting my more down today
I need help to unbury myself and people who stick with it and with me- going up and down makes it hard for me to stick with the process of letting go 
Its a super challenge to find and make time to do it"
bipolar,f6y20vw,t3_dtkblx,1573265277.0,"It did help me today knowing your feelings and experiences and I appreciate your transparency!

I am in a 5/6 week low rt now and praying for meds to help me come out of it!

I feel negative and lazy also and those things do not define me and I deserve happiness too like your therapist said ...

Its just super hard to feel that tho in a low- I would be positive if I could !!! I am awful at ""fake it til I make it""
I don't want to do anything and I want to sleep and lay around and I do it when I can but I still push myself and do pretty much of all my responsibilities

My husband and youngest son who lives at home are very supportive thank God

Again thanks for sharing and bringing me comfort tonight as I read your post xo"

bipolar,f6wb5xo,t1_f6w1uwy,1573222122.0,"Wow that is a long time to deal with depressions - I am so sorry to hear this! You sound like you cope amazingly! Well unbelievably amazingly - I can't imagine it ongoing! I get bouts like for months but then I have up times too - actually sometimes that can make it worse tho because of the opposite poles.

Anyways thanks for sharing ! Seroquel sounds like it does help somewhat and sorry you aren't having any success with Vraylar or Abilify! So glad you have good support ! I get the tiredness too! That makes things so difficult sometimes!  I hope you let yourself sleep! 

Your art must be cool too! I need an outlet like that for depressive times! xo"
bipolar,f6vfnl0,t1_f6va40q,1573184859.0,"That stinks that Abilify and Vraylar are both a no go for you! 
Abilify worked decent for me but I had weight gain I am still unsure about Vraylar- my Dr raised the does today to 4.5 mg and said it may help the depression
I am sorry to hear you struggle with the depressive side - I do too- my depressive cycles seem long and often! Especially this past year - I am 50 years old this year too so hormones can play a factor in it all! Ugh
I haven't ever tried seroquel - does that help depression? How do you manage with the depression? I struggle faking happy! And I don't feel like doing anything! I still do many things of course but I have to push push push myself! 
How about you? How long do your depressions last? Are they varied typically? 
Thanks for responding and sharing info! xo"
bipolar,f6v2yeg,t3_dsfo1v,1573175229.0,What's good is I wrote and posted a few poem type writings for our community and it helped me feel OK while I was writing - been in a low for about 5 weeks so any positive things I can engage in give me some relief - also its been good reading this what's good Wednesday stream! xo
bipolar,f6v2p23,t1_f6qlccp,1573175030.0,This is so awesome! Glad your coming out!  I am in week 5 of a low episode and we adjusted meds so this gives me hope! And I am praying this down will end soon!

I am on a low dose and feel very restless at times on it and like I wanna jump out of my skin! 
I was on Abilify before Vraylar and it didn't seem as bad as Vraylar. If you don't take either-what  do you take now? I am also on Lamictal and Cymbalta- high doses on both ."

I love all the comments as well ! 

Keeping moving is so helpful when we are down and feeling so low! I cry a lot too! Just doing baby steps is enough! And its OK to rest, nap, zone, etc being down can be so so so draining- battling our minds! 
And also facing non bipolar people or unsupportive people is a trip! I just wanna hide from the world!"

BipolarReddit,f5zjowq,t1_f5z1m07,1572578577.0,"Love your encouragement for the person who did the original post- u can tell u work hard at managing and u almost make it sound easy when we both know its not!!! I do my best do some of the things you mention to manage a low coming on or a low state with anxiety that comes over me - with some success-  and no matter how anxious I get or feel I can push to a degree and let myself take long naps if I need to ! 

Let's keep in touch to keep each other going when we may need it? 

Again so glad for how you responded to original post! xo"

BipolarReddit,f5vnmzz,t3_dpd9wg,1572493893.0,"Wow 2 years long UNREAL to that question I originally asked!!! In your case! 

It doesn't scare me as much as it saddens me and at the same time pisses me off ... (Your story)

To go through any length sucks and to have to had to suffer 2 long years = hell!!! So so so sorry u had to endure that coma like state ...

Also really bums me out to hear you can't use meds

I tried 14 different combos within one year back when I was down that 4 or more months- 

I don't give up yet still haven't found the ""cocktail"" 
for stability or my middle

You mentioned anxiety attacks - can't imagine those! Glad you have meds for that! I mostly get anxiety issues with the low cycles"
BipolarReddit,f5vmnx8,t3_dpd9wg,1572493165.0,"That does sum it up- the repeat thing!!! So well

Yet I battle for remission SO intentionally

I have to believe stability will come because I am 50 this year and the pain would be too great to bear - if it is "" a forever "" disability /illness (some others do go into remission right?)

But still- I thank God I do believe in Heaven where all the bullsh-- ends!!!"
BipolarReddit,f5vm0bu,t3_dpd9wg,1572492683.0,P.s.I DO NOT like that say AT ALL 'this too shall pass'
BipolarReddit,f5vly7q,t1_f5ux18c,1572492637.0,"No joke!!! Reality questionings ruminate for me when I am with people and go to any kind of functions in the coma like state and to me its a really BAD dream when extended - how extended have your lows been?
 I experienced a low cycle over the course of 4 months one time when I went off meds! I needed to do an outpatient program it got so bad - my crying spells! Thank God I didn't land inpatient cuz my kids were still pretty young.

Anyways yeah hallelujah when the down periods lift! 

I need to focus on the fact this particular one will come to an end SOON"
BipolarReddit,f5vlape,t1_f5v4iwp,1572492159.0,"Oh.my.gosh. you described all that so so so well!
and  so much rang true for me as well! 

I absolutely hate the thoughts about the depressive state coming back again WHILE I am the low!

Just such mind madness - those times

I believe, (and pray) like you do, that eventually my  combo of meds will bring me to a stable place that can be abstinent of these cycles! 

I always want to keep believing I can be in remission some day! (SOON) 

There is a lot we need to be proactive about tho -on our ends - I think -cuz the meds can take us to a certain place then life happens and there can be triggers lurking around corners...

I never want to be in denial about this aspect anymore 

When in a low I also think each one is as bad as the last! And that is why when in a low I feel stuck And  this brings me full circle to how tremendously difficult it is to know what's real ?!? To have clarity as to the when and how I can/will be functioning with some kind of renewed confidence -
even tho there is that element that you spoke of - ""the veil'' truth... ( that its an illusion of confidence)

We really truly deserve medals for what we endure!!!

Hope and Faith do keep me keeping on as you said we must do and I send those your way and blessings too!"
