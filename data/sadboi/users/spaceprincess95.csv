Christians,fp4c6cc,t3_gb0x2z,1588295942.0,"I was in a similar position please don’t be so hard on yourself. Your Young and learning. Think about how much God understand/ knows you more than you know yourself. Find peace in that. Christianity isn’t about perfection. If you feel anxiety try and pray and meditate on positive thoughts/scripture. Your attraction to her isn’t wrong it’s natural. Try not to worry God has good things Instore for you. Also it could be possible that you will come to an understanding in your faith eventually, not saying that you should date her on this potential though. But try and enjoy and be greatful and accept who she is now and decide based off that."
NevilleGoddard,fp39pph,t1_fp34sgt,1588275538.0,No it was a genuine question. I think you’ve overthought my question. You had an assumption of what I was asking. But it’s fine. ✌🏾
NevilleGoddard,fp32vlw,t1_fp31i8z,1588272152.0,Not looking for validation I’m asking because I didn’t know what it means as I’m still learning.

NevilleGoddard,fk0wzig,t1_fk0al9s,1583767993.0,So I would say the  affirmation repeatedly in my head in The morning while listening to meditation music.  I did this for about 10mins. And I focused on the words and what it meant to me and how I would feel if it happened. But I did think the affirmation was a funny one and I kept laughing. and that was my reaction when it started to happen.

NevilleGoddard,fjzjgtg,t1_fjzedl5,1583721182.0,"“People believe I’m famous, I believe I’m famous
People treat me like I’m famous “
I just wrote it down. And I meditated on the feeling of receiving compliments and attention surrounding fame. I also would repeat it when I woke up in my head. I did all of this maybe 3 times. But it worked so strongly that I got scared lol need to adjust it and say “ positive fame”"

NevilleGoddard,fh7s4yo,t3_f1ql64,1581343217.0,"I didn’t really sleep well last night because I was worrying about my desires. I thought what if I get everything and I’m still not happy. I was trying to understand how to feel peaceful without depending on anything for happiness. And I struggled. Deep down I felt my desires were superficial and materialistic and all about self. I felt bad about that. 

But I think I realise it’s ok to want nice things and good things. I think worrying that I still won’t be happy will attract that. I need to feel deserving of good things. Sometimes I felt it was wrong. My main goal is to be in a place we’re I can give back and help people. Anyways I saw this in the bible today and it further reinforced what I need to be realising about God(IAm)  

God is able to give you more than you need. I realise that I can have the things I desire and have them in the best and healthy way possible not in a dependent way, if I believe. You can have it tailored to you. Not the way others want things but the way that’s right for you. Having healthy attachments is part of the gifts God gives. So I shouldn’t worry.  

I’ve been reading Neville for 3 weeks now. If you have any points of encouragement or corrections pls share. Thanks 🙏🏾 

-as I typed this the sun shone really brightly through my bedroom window. It’s been stormy all week where I live. Grateful for the sun."

ChristianOccultism,ffxmk8f,t1_ffxmb47,1580328175.0,Yh it wasn’t a dream I would talk about it often. My parents remember me coming to them shaking it happened in the day time I was awake. I told the straight after it happened🤷🏽‍♀️Lol
PMDD,fftjv3t,t3_ev1um1,1580222451.0,Yes I PMDD has helped me stand up to toxic people and I feel like my hyper sensitivity around that time has kept me safe in the past because my intuition is heightened. So I’m grateful in that sense. I guess everything happens for a reason.

schizophrenia,fee3v4v,t1_feck7j2,1579025846.0,"@Hercules_Rockefeller thank you both for your reply! Well I got scared because I didn’t know why he was behaving this way and it was effecting me. So I decided to cut contact with him because I was worried he was just being abusive for his own reasons. I wasn’t educated about mental health. 

But when I tried to explain he was very upset and not understanding and he said he never wanted to date me anyways discrediting the whole relationship creating delusional situation which it seems like he believes. 

After awhile he calmed down and said he didn’t know why he was doing these things. But the effort to calm him down and not knowing what the issue is was draining and naturally I just thought he was doing it on purpose. Because I blocked him he decided to block me he blames me. 

I explained that I felt unsafe but it’s like he resents me irrationally since the relationship started. He creates false situations in his head against me. But I explain and calm him down then he’s fine but it was happening all the time. It’s like he sees me as the enemy idk why. 

I think sometimes it’s because I didn’t agree with him when he said he was famous it’s angers him. He has issues but he hides it but he comes across as weird to others sometimes. 

We’re not in contact Since September. He was behaving erratically when I last saw him. And made everyone believe I was chasing him and he wasn’t interested. I knew he was lying but it really hurt and was embarrassing because it was in front of his friends and many people. He hasn’t reached out either he’s very angry idk why."
lawofattraction,febnrcw,t3_eoaqex,1578960801.0,Hi do you have any tips on how you manifested money.
PMDD,fdrf2rx,t3_emrkcb,1578683650.0,This really touched me💜
Anxietyhelp,fde4tzz,t1_fcvawhn,1578331204.0,Thank you for your message. I’m trying to get better. I realise that maybe this feelings are triggered by my ex. Everyday is a struggle. I’m not working because I don’t want to mess up and disappoint an employer. I’m currently bored. I don’t enjoy much. I had many hobbies before. But I just don’t think I’m amazing deep down so I just do stuff but everyone else thinks it’s good but I just think it’s not. I wasn’t an over thinker before but now I am recently. Trying to find enjoyment in life.
PMDD,fcuq1s4,t3_eix7ym,1577986202.0,I get this and it’s so bad makes me feel like I want to die💔
depression,fb57pia,t3_ebeok0,1576522541.0,That’s so amazing happy for you! During this time try to write down how you feel happy thoughts extra to remind you that you can become happy again if you feel depressed ever again.

PMDD,f9gycqx,t3_e4qqg5,1575306495.0,This month and the last few I’ve been experiencing symptoms during my period too normally when my period ends I feel better. It’s like it takes a few days after my period starts for me to be totally totally normal again.
PMDD,f8tgnzx,t3_e206qy,1574802999.0,Same today has been rough 💔
PMDD,f7ibud7,t3_dw4vno,1573756816.0,Mine used to be only a week before then it started to get longer so 2 weeks before and then the week during my period. When I’m fine again I have anxiety because Im preparing to be sad again and worried about what’s to come.
PMDD,ewkt1b2,t1_ewkgcrq,1565493760.0,Thanks 💜I’m glad someone understands. I’ve calmed down more now.

emotionalabuse,euejsn8,t1_euej3aa,1563746134.0,Ignore this comment. This is not correct behaviour.
DecidingToBeBetter,eto7f63,t3_caureh,1563017492.0,Thanks for posting this it really gives me hope that things get better. I was feeling like such a failure because I was struggling to function everyday. I that things get better.
emotionalabuse,etnco6w,t1_etmy7ge,1562983235.0,Yh your right 💜 I’m not normal used to lying so I feel kinda drained. I think I’m constantly trying to be something I’m not showing people I’m ok. But I know these people shouldn’t know the truth. Because I don’t trust them. But inside myself I feel anxiety. Because I know the truth.
Christian,etmn79h,t3_ccfu27,1562963798.0,Yh I stopped going to church for this reason. I started to feel bad about myself like I wasn’t good enough to be a Christian. I fellowship with non judgemental Christians online. I feel like we’re all trying and we all get tempted. No one can be the perfect Christian it’s impossible. Good works dont get you to heaven.  Just accepting  Jesus as your lord and saviour is the most important. Do your best God knows your heart.
emotionalabuse,esx37e6,t1_esvji3m,1562324713.0,Hi thanks. Sometimes it’s hard because I never knew what was happening. It’s like all his issues regarding me are very complex and many. It’s hard to wrap my head around the situation sometimes I get headaches because I just don’t know how someone can behave this way. I try to remind myself that it’s not my fault but I think my natural reaction to his responses makes me feel like I’ve done something really bad and this is my punishment. I want to understand how a normal relationship is supposed to be like and how to have boundaries. At the moment I don’t want to date. I’ve become afraid of people even my friends I hardly see them. They thought the relationship was perfect from how he would pretend to them. So many of them were jealous and are happy we’re not together. So I just don’t tell anyone. Not even my family know because they will be heartbroken. I tried explained to my dad because I was having a break down and crying but he just said I was weak. He always calls me weak since I was a child. He said people will take advantage of me. He’s not a good husband either. Sometimes I don’t know the steps to take to get better. Atm I can’t go to work because I’m depressed my life is a mess I have so much fear.
PMDD,eqjzrt8,t1_eqjvcvv,1560113900.0,Yh it’s like a “jack in the box” sometimes. I know it’s coming but sometimes I hope it will be different then it just happens again. Also my parents really don’t understand. They think I’m just having growing up anxiety. But I think maybe they are scared to face the reality. So I have to find the solution on my own.
