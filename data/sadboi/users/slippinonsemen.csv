So I sent her my IG request about half a year ago, we always had one class together but we didn't interact that much and she didn't accept it yet, but then 1-2 months ago she joined my music class which is pretty small so there's a lot more interaction between the students.

~2 weeks ago, we had a group presentation which involved singing, at which I'd say I'm pretty good at. Maybe she enjoyed it? Anyway later that day she finally accepted my IG request, then one day later she created a new account and followed only a few people (I was one of the first people she followed) & she posted some pictures which she never did before. sooooooo, I know we can only speculate but what do you think? Am I interpreting too much into this?"

we only texted once before and I just texted her ""Hey what courses will you be taking next year in school?""
