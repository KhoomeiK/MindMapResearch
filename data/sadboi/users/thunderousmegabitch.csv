Every time I see one of these AITA posts about people not being friends/not dating someone because of their or their family's race, I feel like I'm just tripping my tits off and reading everything all wrong.

Like, for real, are there people that care about this? Are there mothers and fathers that don't accept a daughter-in-law or a son-in-law because of their race? Are there really people that legit break up with someone because of their heritage? Are people really disclosing their family trees in full detail every first date that they go with people? 

I ask because it just feels so fucking out of this world. Because I can't imagine me or the people around me pulling shit like this. I can't imagine really caring about any of this shit and restricting all your relationships so you're only close to people who have the same skin color/heritage as you. It's like, I'm aware that racism exists, but I didn't expect the world to still have people that think that being white is ""superior"" or that we should only congregate with people whose skin/features look like ours.

I'm aware that this is probably because of privilege, I'm white as all hell in a country where more than half of its population is POC. I can't say jack shit about the subject because I'm not oppressed for being white. So I'd like some insight on the subject if anyone is willing to give me any. And if no one wants to then that's okay too, because this is something I'm supposed to start being more educated on and I just don't go read because I'm fucking stupid."

And the ""dog is family"" thing: I live with my mom. We have a dog and two cats. I consider them family. And they aren't allowed anywhere inside the house under any circunstances. We have a small backyard where the cats stay and a frontyard where the dog stays, he has enough space there to run and play, and my SIL goes to play with him on her free time. Does this mean we love them any less? No, but my mom doesn't want fleas/bodily fluids/excrements/fur on her stuff/the dog jumping on her when she's inside. And that's totally fine, even tho I wish the cats could stay inside, it's everyone's house and my wishes are not the rule.

And OH MY GOD YOU WANT A ROTTWEILLER. You know that they can get pretty ginormous, right? It's even worse. At least if you wanted something small like a chihuahua you'd have the excuse of it not eating much and not taking much space.

she should stay far far away from this man. the stuff about him ""not liking her family"" probably means that they warned her that he was no good, and he's trying to keep them away from her so she won't really have a support network.

reading her comments after the post scared the shit out of me. she makes way more than her husband, works full-time, raises a 3mo son and a 4yo daughter basically by herself, doesn't sleep, and can't have anyone helping her because her husband (who sleeps well at night plus has a job that allows him enough free time that he can spend it watching netflix and thinks that he still needs ""recharging"" after coming home from a lot of doing nothing)won't _allow_ her.

because he wants to control her. he wants her to be so exhausted that she won't have time to think about complain about the shitty stuff he does, and he doesn't want any ""outsiders"" involved because he knows that anyone who finds out about this situation is going to talk to her, tell her the truth and help her get away from him.

she's scared to leave him, as she said in one of the comments. that should be reason enough for everyone in here defending the husband/saying that it's a ""communication"" issue to shut the fuck up. there is no communicating with an abusive person. there's only packing your bags, going straight to a family/friend house and taking all the legal precautions so he'll stay as far away as possible from her and her kids."

You're her mother. You know that, right? Then why do you allow your husband to make all the calls about how y'all should be parenting your child that you *both* made and are supposed to care for while you just sit around and ""feel bad"" for things?

If you don't agree with him, then don't enable him to continue behaving that way. If you do, you're just as bad as him for possibly screwing up your daughter's mental health.

First: give back her electronics. Second: from now on, allow her to have some privacy, both on the internet and in her personal physical space. That includes knocking before entering her room, and not checking her search history to ""find something incriminating"". I truly hope from now on she starts using the anonymous browser just so you can't go around snooping.

Before y'all come at me with ""they need to know what type of content she's consuming"": she's 15, not 5. At 15 I had a pretty good view of what was good for my life and what would fuck me over. She knows not to watch/see/read ""bad stuff"", and the ""worst"" this gal is probably doing is watching porn. 

Now that she's found out she isn't safe in her own home, she's probably going to still try to find out about her body on the outside world, away from your view and judgement. You are the only ones to blame if she gets into a sketchy situation because of that, because you decided to punish her for something completely normal instead of leaving it be (i personally would like to be left alone if someone caught me masturbating and wouldn't want to talk about it) or offering helpful advice that will lead to a normal, healthy sex life down the road. 

Start pissing in your house to assert dominance, sis.
