My solution was to diversify my contact. I spend a lot more time with friends and try to talk to them more. My goal was to naturally forget about my partner to a normal degree, where they werent on my mind all day. 

Its a weird thing to brag about, but sometimes i would forget to text back within ten or fifteen minutes and that felt like a victory for me. I didnt need constant connection, just the regular amount. 

Your friends will distract you, but you also need to find other things to do like many others have said."
