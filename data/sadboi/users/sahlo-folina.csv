SampleSize,fqxifys,t3_gl9jyf,1589732789.0,"this is so interesting, but just a heads up as someone quite into astrology ‘star signs’ and horoscopes like these are notorious for being inaccurate, they’re referencing your sun sign but you have 5 other personal placements plus outer planets that make up you and each one manifests differently and to different intensities depending on where they fall and how they’re aspected (the angles they form at the moment you’re born). so when the results of this are out please don’t assume that they mean astrology as a whole is rubbish. i’d love to one day do some kind of study where multiple top astrologers give a complete reading of multiple natal charts, and then look into their life story, have them describe themselves, have their loved ones describe them and then see what % is similar between the reports, and then have a control group comparing to a randomly generated natal chart and reading to see if there’s a difference. but i think that’d be a bit impossible to organise as someone with no money or qualifications lol, so it’s good to see this anyway"

seriously though, i know this is a really difficult topic and some of my post is probably quite hard to swallow, i’m sorry for that. but i love you and care about you and whatever level of empathy you have whether due to bpd or not is absolutely okay, doesn’t make you a bad person and isn’t your fault. it’s where you go from here that matters, but i’m with you"
BPD,fq1he25,t1_fq11wl4,1589045674.0,"that can be common - you aren’t alone in that and i hope you are doing well recovering from what sounds like an abusive relationship. i don’t know if this is of any value to you, but as someone with bpd i really relate to that description (though not to the extremes you’re describing) due to the internal emotional intensity/dissociation. i don’t know if you are interested in hearing what it’s like internally but it might provide a little insight and help you heal a little (if not you can just click away and that’s fine, i wish you well).

for me, when episodes like that occur it can feel like someone’s just taken the switchboard that keeps you running along fine, and smashed all the buttons and all the ‘empathy’, ‘dignity’, ‘morals’ etc switches just get completely switched and all you can comprehend for anything ranging from a few seconds to a few days is the intense emotion of that moment or even intense numbness or emptiness. like the moment of fight or flight you get rocking back on a chair and it wobbles, or if someone jumpscares you, and in that moment it’s just every man for himself, you don’t comprehend how you look or the damage you might cause, you’re entire being is just focused on whatever the end goal of that emotion is. and if that emotion is anger or nothing at all, things can get messy. HOWEVER, that does not make that behaviour okay and it is mine and your ex’s and anyone else who can get like that’s responsibility to manage our mental health in a way that isn’t damaging to others, and if you got out of that relationship because your ex wasn’t doing that, i’m proud of you. i just wanna say, absolutely nothing your ex did was a reflection of you, it was a reflection of her internal state. i might be projecting but if she showed a lot of empathy at other times, chances are she feels pretty bad about some of her behaviour, and doesn’t actually hate you or wish harm on you if you’ve been made to feel that way, you were just in the firing line of mental illness and fucked up behaviours, but if any other person were in the same spot they would have gone through the same. it’s not your fault, and it does not have any say on who you are as a person. i hope you’re healing well 🖤"
BPD,fq1c43c,t1_fq104m0,1589044274.0,"that’s a really good pov. everyone should define their disorder themselves, you’re right it’s not my business how you define yourself. if this were cmv i’d be giving you deltas haha. and i agree about the thing where if you say your bpd makes you [negative thing], you should also be able to say your bpd makes you [positive thing], if you feel that to be the case. i guess personally, i view it as simply the diagnostic criteria and the symptoms you identify in yourself, nothing more nothing less. so to me, that doesn’t ‘make you’ empathetic or ‘make you’ unempathetic, because empathy is an innate human experience. it can however influence it, so for example intense emotions or fears of abandonment could cloud your ability to empathise with your partner for example. or it could not. or you could just be the type of bpd that isn’t massively affected interpersonally but meet the rest of the criteria. and i think for me, because bpd symptoms do have that capability and varying levels of empathy exist outside of bpd traits, i disagree with people saying ‘bpd makes you an empath’ as a generalisation, because from personal experience some symptoms have negatively impacted my empathy and i didn’t realise because i was sat there going i’m bpd therefore i must be The Empath. so my intention with this post was to try and show the different possibilities and hopefully help people in the same position i was. but like you said we should absolutely be celebrating the good about people as well, and i kinda agree with your alcoholism analogy, imo i guess alcohol can reveal assholeness but it’s not the alcohol that ‘makes you’ an asshole, it’s the issues underlying or alongside. and that’s okay, as long as we’re all have the same end goal in mind"
BPD,fq184p5,t1_fq0v283,1589043076.0,"agree, i mean that’s kind of accidentally what i did with this whole post lol. good food for thought. i do/did stuff like that too, but i’m proud of you for overcoming it"
BPD,fq17sfn,t1_fq0sbt5,1589042937.0,"yeah it all depends on the person and their overall experiences and personality, like on the other hand, a child who was maybe forced to witness violence for example could become numb to it so they struggle to feel for others and can come across as cold/callous as an adult. but like you put so well it’s a symptom of a situation, and everybody is different and responds to situations differently. it’s just not the bpd that’s made you that way whatever end of the spectrum, it’s the shit you went through or the personality you developed alongside it."
BPD,fq16hbl,t1_fq0zeyc,1589042420.0,"hey, this was never my intention i just meant to give examples of different experiences i’ve personally had or witnessed in others. what i mean by the title was bpd doesn’t make you an empath but i agree people with bpd are absolutely capable of empathy, just if you’re empathetic, you’re like that because that’s just who you are as a human being, not because the bpd made you that way if that makes sense? and it’s totally possible for ur bpd symptoms to not affect empathy at all. but on the flip side, in others, including myself, bpd symptoms can affect empathy or people can just simply happen to be bpd and struggle with empathy simultaneously or a person could not have any mental illnesses or disorders at all and just be unempathetic. so it’s just something to consider. i’ve seen a few people in this sub and in other online communities make massive generalisations like ‘people with bpd are empaths’, ‘bpd makes you empathetic’, so this was to kind of counteract that because imo people with bpd can be empaths or not empaths or it can fluctuate because that’s how humans work, and personally those misconceptions have been quite damaging to me and idk if people have experienced the same thing, but if they have hopefully we can have a conversation about it and it might help a bit"
BPD,fq1485a,t1_fq0hx2g,1589041519.0,"that’s completely understandable, i’m exactly the same i need somebody to say directly say what they’re thinking/feeling or i will be oblivious lol. i’m trying to learn it’s okay though and direct communication can actually be really beneficial. 

i feel that, i think some people weaponise the terms and use them as a way elevate some into some kind of superiority (often themselves) and put down others into inferiority (often another). which is ironic, because unless you’re like a psychiatrist or legitimately know what you’re doing, classifying people like that could be considered a little unempathetic and even a little narcissistic. but you know that’s not the label they’ve given themselves."

i hope no one minds me sharing it’s maybe not allowed but i’m feeling the same and haven’t really spoken about it before?? i was actually professionally diagnosed with ‘emotional dysregulation’ at like 14.

i have trust issues and a slight fear of rejection/abandonment, stemming from being mocked/abandoned as a child, so i am sensitive to reminders of that but at the same time i have never and would never react to that how the people discussed in this sub have (threats of suicide/violence, blackmailing, manipulation/abuse, etc) and i don’t know if it counts as ‘frantic efforts’. i just feel shitty about it. i’ve only ever had one relationship which i broke off with a letter gently explaining i’m sorry but i just don’t feel romantically like that anymore and we are on decent terms as friends, as i child i switched through friends a lot, but then doesn’t every child? i am lost identity wise and i don’t really know who i am or what i wanna do career wise but i also just turned 19 so to an extent isn’t that normal? i’m a little impulsive but not really, i try and budget well, i drink/smoke weed occasionally socially but not outside what everyone my age is doing. i would say my eating is a lil disordered occasionally but literally every other area of impulsivity i have zero experience in (driving, sex, hard drugs etc). for the most part i stay inside for months on end bc i’m terrified to leave the house, i have severe anxiety and i’m actually wondering about slight AvPD which seems fairly un-BPD lol. afaik BPDs act out, i act in or just stay home and don’t really act at all. i have been sucidal multiple times, attempted suicide and i have self harmed in the past in response to depression/intense emotions. but i HAVE NEVER and WOULD NEVER do those things to manipulate others or even as threats/blackmail?? that makes me sick?? i literally hid it?? and i feel such a deep shame and guilt for the effects me attempting had on my family even though at the time i thought i would be doing them a favour. my emotions are intense and i struggle to cope with them. that’s the one that makes me think i could be BPD bc ngl i am emotionally unstable. BUT i do want to get better and i do worry how these emotions can affect others whereas it seems most BPDs don’t care and follow them blindly or use them to manipulate. i do feel empty a lot of the time but it’s never a big deal and i don’t really act on it it’s just there. as a kid i had anger issues, threw tantrums and repeated horrible things i heard out of temper but now i haven’t said anything like that in years (and i feel disgusting for ever having done so) and i haven’t found myself genuinely really angry like that in over a year. idk if i’m paranoid, i mean i am anxious and i spent most of 2016 with blu tack on my cameras bc of conspiracies but thats about it. but i believe i do dissociate and i often get derealization/depersonalisation type stuff. 

so i’m struggling to tell whether i meet all 9 of the criteria or none of the criteria lol. but the stuff described on this sub is 100% not me, i would never cheat, lie, abuse, threaten etcetc. i believe my dad is maybe BPD/NPD and my mum may have had issues with co-dependency, and he definitely lashed out physically and emotional, drank more than he should, used lil me as some kinda therapist etc although their relationship was 12 years and if anyone had short unstable relationships or even cheated, it was my mum. so idk if my dad is more narc than BPD, but i like to think i’m nothing like him. i hope. i’ve only seen him twice in about 18 months and i’m hit and miss with replying to his texts bc i know he’s a bad influence to have in my life so i try to distance myself (i sent a paragraph explaining it). although he does try ‘hoovering’/drunk texting me sometimes.

so yeah, i think being raised by narc/BPD could give u BPDesque feelings without having actual bpd, or maybe this is a manifestation of cptsd or something?

either way, you’re not alone. i have no answers because i’m still searching myself, but solidarity 🖤"

NoStupidQuestions,esrpa7n,t3_c8xbic,1562232236.0,yes. instead of frantically unliking you’re better off quickly putting your phone in flight mode and hoping you lose connection before it reaches them
changemyview,esrogle,t1_esp0s6x,1562231437.0,"firstly, i somewhat agree. but while not the extreme poverty line i live under the relative probability line in the uk and to be frank i do not have money left at the end of the month either. but i need to buy food anyway, to live, why not make it vegan? not that any kind of junk food is healthiest for you or the environment but there are more vegan options than ever if that’s where you’re at. and a carton of plant based milk is more ethically sourced and costs the same as a carton of cows milk. you can get fruit and veg in season for pennies. i know it is possible to be vegan on a low income, because i am. lowering your carbon footprint isn’t necessarily expensive at all. if you’re paying thousands on solar panels and the finest quinoa sure, but lots of ways to help the environment are cheap and accessible. walking is free, using public transport is cheaper than running a car (the original reason my family don’t have a car is we can’t afford one). switching to a renewable energy provider can often get you a better deal, saving water saves you money on your bill. everyone in the western world can afford to worry about climate change, and everyone should, imo.

secondly, 100%. i’ve been realising from this thread the focus should probably be less on individuals and more on the corporations doing the damage. but as an individual, changing your diet or going vegan, or doing anything else to lower your carbon footprint is still a great place to start in the meantime.

thirdly, being from the uk i just find the gun debate in america perplexing. it seems obvious to me gun control is the way to go, but i see your point about the counter movement. i wonder if that’s where the anti vegan movement comes from - we’re just tryna educate and do the right thing, but people feel like they’re being told what to do so specifically fight against it. but i agree no one should *have* to be vegan, but i think everyone should have access to the facts and vegan options and make their own informed decision. with that said, ‘i’m gonna eat my steak no matter what the effects on the environment are because i don’t like being told what to do’ seems like a very childish stance to take"
changemyview,esrlln0,t1_esq5pz9,1562228837.0,"okay so what are your arguments against it? what was the thing that made you believe climate change couldn’t be caused by humans?

i thought living on an all meat diet you physically cannot get the vitamins you need. vitamin c, vitamin e, folate, etc. i know plants cannot provide one vitamin you need (vitamin b12) but this is fortified into many different vegan foods and very easily supplemented if necessary. but isn’t an all meat diet a recipe for scurvy? plus red meat is recognised by the who as carcinogenic and cancer charities around the world recommend you reduce your intake to reduce your risk of cancer? who are these healthiest people on the planet?"
changemyview,esou1ao,t1_esomuq4,1562174200.0,"interesting. no, i don’t believe that’s the right way to go at all. but i don’t see how the nature of the meat and dairy industry today is gonna help. you could argue that’s why cattle are farmed in concentration camps but realistically, they’re in warehouse mega farms bc it’s the most ‘efficient’ and profitable. cattle aren’t gonna be grazing keeping our eco system nice and balanced if we’re killing them as calves for meat or killing them early from the trauma they’re put through by the dairy industry. any kind of intensive farming on a massive scale isn’t gonna work, but for now, surely going plant based is the best we can do in this situation.

i’m not part of the 1% but surely we can make it a long term goal to build a system where locally sourced sustainable (vegan) food is available to everyone?"
changemyview,esorn9c,t1_esophi0,1562173083.0,"surely we can do both? i picked veganism bc it’s for me one the easiest and most often discussed, but how do you know i’m not putting my energy into the things listed as well?"
changemyview,esor2om,t1_esopx1z,1562172822.0,"1. i already partially changed my view, and i don’t think i’m actively fighting vigorously against people’s arguments. i disagree with some, agree with some but i’m keeping an open mind.

2. okay, fair enough that’s probably phrased badly, but it’s one of those things that seems so obvious to me, i don’t know how to explain it. which is why i want people who don’t believe in it to challenge me on it so i can understand their pov."
changemyview,esopdit,t1_esoofpc,1562171993.0,"that makes so much sense. i kinda feel like it’s the same with the plastic straw debate, like ‘here use this paper straw to give you the illusion you’re making a difference while our corporation fucks up the planet’. it’s like that trick that parents do with their kids, to give the illusion of choice. parents pick 2 scenarios that would suit them and makes the child choose and the child walks away thinking they’ve gotten a good deal while the parent has got what they want. ultimately, we’re still contributing to the problem."
changemyview,esong42,t1_eson4ck,1562170983.0,"dang i agree. obviously, i’m not quitting veganism but i think you might be changing my view. i think we need to place more emphasis on changing the system than individual diets. but with that said, a vegan diet is still a step in the right direction.

changemyview,esompx2,t1_esoi3va,1562170571.0,"i agree we’ve done a lot of damage, and some of that is irreversible. even if tomorrow we magically stopped producing green house gases, what we still have done will remain and actively negatively effect the world for centuries to come. but at the same time, why just make that worse. for as long as there is still life on this earth, surely we should preserve what we can instead of going all in and annihilating everything completely. can we not at least make a bad situation better?"
changemyview,esolwe4,t1_esoi2wc,1562170126.0,"i meant it in the settings of eating out, living my life, vaguely mentioning that i’m vegan when necessary, etc. or when i just see people talking shit about vegans for seemingly no reason.

because this is a sub to discuss your views and listen to the arguments against them, to an extent isn’t the point here that we don’t mind our business? btw, i added the bits in brackets because i felt like the title wasn’t accurate enough or it’d get taken down, so i’m not the proudest of how it’s phrased but idk how to rephrase. with that said, climate change denial and anti vegan hate not making sense to me is part of my view, hence why i posted to change my view"
changemyview,esoktf3,t1_esoiw6w,1562169537.0,"i see your point but doesn’t thinking like that kinda reinforce it as reality? nothing will change overnight but is it not worth a try? over the years veganism has grown so much, it is starting to make changes. brands are listening and creating vegan options, society is talking about it more than ever, and with time, this will translate to obvious world changes if people keep joining and we keep the momentum we have now. of course mandating everyone to go vegan is a terrible idea, but i think everyone should at least consider it. yeah, you might not get the instant gratification you get eating meat and animal products and u might not enjoy it initially, but over the long term, surely we will start to see the benefits?"
changemyview,esojn9n,t1_esohw3p,1562168907.0,"checked out the link, seems to be highlighting the issue that not everyone is able to be vegan for health reasons and how a lot of white rich vegans seem to be building a space that excludes lower classes and minorities. i agree, although i don’t necessarily think it’s a dealbreaker or see how it means we’re doing more harm than good. i’m poor and part of some minorities myself. i think we need to ensure the movement is as inclusive as possible, fight to have healthy sustainable vegan food choices accessible and affordable to everyone, and respect that not everyone, can be totally vegan bc it’s not healthy for them. but at the same time, it doesn’t necessarily stop a person trying. for example, someone reliant on red meat can usually still cut down eggs/dairy, which ultimately is better than nothing. and i don’t know how to voice this without sounding harsh, but the effect on the planet is the same regardless of whether people are eating meat/dairy for health or for the fun of it - it’s still the same end result. so we need to do something about it, but other than as many people being vegan or as close to vegan as possible, i don’t know what"

MentalHealthSupport,ermhqrt,t3_c2qatj,1561023350.0,"hi! what makes you think people are robots? i’ve felt that way before, but it’s always just been a transient thought / worry - what would be the motivation behind everyone being robots? how do i know i’m not just jumping to conclusions? it’s confusing

clozapine is a heavy drug, please be careful. even if you think it’s being used to control you, it can cause horrible withdrawals, so taper down slowly and if you can find one you trust, speak to a doctor. ofc, i know ‘trust’ and ‘doctors’ tend not to be words that go together haha, so if not, is there anyone close you can let know what you’re doing who will look out for you? you don’t need to go through this alone.

lastly, pls try not to act on impulse, although easier said than done. i saw you post about wanting to rip off someone’s face to see if they’re a robot, and while it makes sense that you might have that urge, going through with it will land you in prison. and if you’re wrong, you might seriously hurt a real person. likewise, please look after yourself and be gentle with yourself. it sounds wishy washy but try to practise self care, maybe journal your experiences, meditate on it, etc. the last thing we want to happen is anyone to get hurt.

good luck!!"
