I know it's really hard to live through a life where your triggers are fairly common, but the best thing I can recommend is trying to wear headphones or earbuds for longer to block out the noise. Sometimes you have to try and endure your trigger, but most of the time its completely fine to just do everything you can to block them out. Living with earbuds in often can be challenging, but it's far better than you going crazy. And I'm sure your family and friends will accept it eventually, even if the whole thing is weird at first, which it usually is. Sometimes families just refuse to believe misophonia even exists, but theres still ways to cope even then. You can DM me if you want, and we can talk about the stuff you're dealing with. I know it's hard. Sometimes it feels like your life is being ruined. But still, i hope you can hang in there, and I wish the best for you from the bottom of my heart."

Exasperated-lemon was a small, sour woman who was incredibly rich and loved to make lemon meringue pie. Every night, she slept from 8pm to 5am without ever waking up in the middle of the night. She did this by making special sleepy pies that she would bake for herself every night that would let her sleep. But one fateful day, she hosted a party at her house with 50 other girls that she knew in college. For the occasion, she baked 400 lemon meringue pies in just 2 hours. It was exhausting, and she figured she would sleep very easily that night. However, by the end of the party, she found that only 20 of per 400 pies had been eaten. She did not know what to do, for she did not want her pies to go to waste. So, this woman single handedly ate 380 pies in just 10 minutes right before bed. The amount of sugar she consumed was intense, and she could not think straight. She ended up clonking out on her couch, having forgotten to eat her nightly sleepy pie. So, sadly, she could not sleep the full night, and woke up at 1:49 in the morning with a sugar high that was able to be resurrected because of the sheer amount of sugar she consumed just 6 hours ago."

Glasslawnmower was a sentient lawn mower who couldn't think straight. However, they had incredible hearing despite being a rather loud machine. This is how they were able to hear everything going on within a 500 mile radius. One day they attached their hearing onto a single person who was acting suspicious. The person entered a junk store, and looked around for a little while before asking to buy 11  meters of llama hide, 2 cartons, 32 pans of fodder, and a pubic inseam. This confused the lawnmower, and so it was led to believe they had heard homicide, arson, manslaughter, and public indecency."
