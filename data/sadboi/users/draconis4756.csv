It was for two reasons. I wanted to see more of old Ben. I want to watch him fight a bit more. I also wanted to see maul be a bit more dangerous too. 

Second, I was hoping that the kenobi movie or show would showcase maul. 

It was just a blink of an eye for me and it was so much of a build up and then done so fast. 

Not complaining because the show was great. Just how I felt when I saw it. Now that I’m writing this, I wanna watch it again to see how I feel."
