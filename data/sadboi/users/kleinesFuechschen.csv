PeterHitchens,ewscbar,t3_cpi0u1,1565724553.0,"Peter Hitchens is extremely smart, observant, and civilised. He's the only rational (as opposed to the many irrational bible thumpers) man I've seen to still value and defend christian morality in public.

The only problem I see with his philosophy is his christian dogma, which although I think is good, and I agree with all of the values, is, in today's political and social climate untenable. I do not think there are any defensible arguments for Christianity. Though I would be glad should some convincing ones be found.

I think Peter sees christian morality as the sole way to save the West, which I would agree with. He also sees that Christianity is effectively dead, and unlikely to return, which I also agree with. This leads to his pessimism.

I think however though, that there is another secular way. I think we can bring back christian morality, without religion, in that, it can be scientifically shown, that christian morality leads to safer, wealthier societies and healthier families, etc. There are already several studies showing the benefits of christian morality. For example, how the number of sexual partners a person has in their life, is directly correlated with the likelihood of divorce.

I find Jordan Petersons philosophy quite good here, and a great antidote for Peter's pessimism.

If we accept that christian morality is good and necessary for a successful society, than rather than lament how others do not follow it, we can each implement it in our own lives, thus making a positive change for ourselves and being good examples for society.

The other option, is to preach as Peter has done (though he is a wonderful example for christian morality), but unfortunately that is unlikely to convince people to stop behaving irresponsibly.

We cannot change others, but we can change ourselves, and in the process, perhaps others will change themselves too.

This is the only hope I see for the West, and I do see many people who are worried about what is happening and ready to make changes, just look at John Anderson's youtube channel or the phenomenon of Jordan Peterson.

There is still hope."

And yes, nihilsm can be, and has been, *many, many* times (Nietzsche, Existentialists) overcome on a subjective personal level, **just as you have already over come it,** but through negation via your pessimism. Through a similar process you could have developed an optimistic outlook, which is positive instead of negative. You are currently a pessimistic existentialist, when you could just as well be an optimistic existentialist, there is no objective difference. Or you could achieve a healthy human balance between optimism and pessimism.

Being an optimist or a pessimist, are identically meaningless and stand in direct contradiction to nihilism. So your choice is arbitrary on an objective level.

Nietzsche's life affirming philosophy tried to overcome nihilism through a value-free philosophy. I do not know enough about him, to judge how succesful he was, only to say his philosophy is of great practical and philosophical value, on a subjective level."

Also, ***nihilism has absolutely nothing to do with pessimism***. Nihilism is a rejection of all value, and pessimism is a value judgement, namely that things are *""bad""*. If you are pessimist you are not a nihilist, because somewhere you have a meaning that something can be *""bad""*, which nihilism a priori rejects.

On the biological side, by being pessimistic, which has nothing to do with being nihilistic, you are signaling feebleness and weakness, you are not playing your social role properly, and this concerns people. People can sense this without even speaking with you:

* Do you look people in the eye?
* Do you slouch?
* Do you stare at the ground?
* Do you fidget?
* Do you have bad posture?
* What clothes do you wear?
* Do you look clean?
* Are you overweight?
* Is your hair combed?
* Do you smell?

These are non-verbal indicators of your emotional and psychological health, which people notice, and they then treat you accordingly, namely as someone of low status and importance, which ironically, leads to many of them treating you poorly and without respect, worsening your status even more. Humans as primates, are very attune to status. Humans' primate brains like high status, and avoid low status.

Once I had completed my Computer Science studies, I was invited to live with her. By the time this happened my German had improved significantly, but there was still a long way to go. It was naturally extremely helpful to have had a native German to assist me through my move and acclimation to Germany.

After I had arrived I began looking for work as a programmer, which at the time was, and still is, an in-demand profession in Germany, especially for native English speakers. Since I also already spoke some German, I was able to find a job very quickly.

After working and living for over a year and half in a German speaking environment, during which time I very rarely spoke English, I had achieved near mastery of German.

A few months ago my girlfriend and I separated. Since then I have significantly reduced the amount of German I use. I have reverted to doing most things in English again, because I simply no longer have the same level of interest in German as I once did and due to the fact that the constant German had seriously affected my English. For example, I had begun mixing German words into my English speech, or I would only know the German word for something, but would have forgotten the English word.

As of now, I would say my German abilities have regressed quite significantly, and the almost absolute command I felt I had of German has disappeared and my English accent has become more noticeable again. In the same measure however, I am regaining my command of the English language.

Either Scotland can stay with the U.K. and leave the EU or Scotland will still have to leave the EU with the U.K., but they could then try for independence from the U.K. again, and then reapply to join the EU. It would be a long road.

I suppose the question is if Scotland is better off in the U.K. or in the EU, and the costs that would be associated with leaving the U.K. to join the EU.

Secondly, all of the synergies within the U.K. that allow Scotland to punch above its weight will be eliminated, and that benefits no one.

I don't think Scotland would be that much worse off, but I don't think any of the proposed benefits will materialise either. It will be just like Brexit. It will cost Scotland tons of money and time, to negotiate the departure and to set up or restructure many government functions (currency, military, health care), which already exist within the U.K.,for maybe marginal benefits.

Relax. I had a similar situation. I had a psychosis in 2014 when I was 20. I went batshit insane, running around the streets yelling something about having found the holy grail and God. I also tried to escape from the hospital and did all other sorts of crazy stuff.

That's still the only time I've been in the looney bin or had a real episode.

My first doc told me I would have to take medication for the rest of my life and could go bonkers again at any moment. I have been medication free for over a year now.

I think I do have bipolar, but I have been able to manage it, so far at least, without medication.

I pay attention to my moods, meditate, and notice if I'm getting too high or low, and try to steer back to the middle. Learning to control my emotions has helped the most, as well as focusing on getting quality sleep. I don't drink alcohol or caffeine. It's a lot of work but I absolutely hated the medication.

I also spent time analysing my psychosis to figure out what triggered it. I now avoid those things.

At the end of the day, I feel like I can influence whether or not I lose it again, but like I said, it takes a lot of work. I do not know if this would work for other people.

This I fear, will only worsen, as each generation has less incentive to behave so, until we have a society unbounded by morality or such important values, which will eventually breakdown and need to ""reset"" its moral compass to start functioning properly again. These ""resets"" as seen throughout history are generally incredibly unpleasant times to be alive.

Some examples of systemic problems:

\- insatiable need to grow GDP

\- insatiable need to increase profits

\- lower levels of trust in society

\- easier to get a divorce

\- increased casual sexual relations

\- massive debt loads

\- fewer children

As perhaps a last anecdote, I always try to imagine what my grandpa would have said about a President of the United States who behaves as Donald Trump does. I doubt he would have ever been able to believe it possible. Such a man would have never made it anywhere 60 years ago with such disgusting behaviour, or at least he would not have gotten away with it in public. He is truly a disgrace, as are many other politicians."

JordanPeterson,et9bkxb,t1_et9a8qg,1562592512.0,"I would define western culture as the set of intersecting cultural values of the nations of Western Europe and those which evolved thereof. Of course, every western nation has a unique culture, but almost all of them share a common roman-greek-christian background.

The decline of christianity in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a relativisation of morality and culture. The rise of empirically based science also led to the rise of nihilism. Nihilism is dangerous, because although likely correct, it sucks meaning out of things necessary for the formation and continuation of healthy human societies.

Human societies can only function when certain levels of trust and common values (culture) exist. We have thrown away our old common values and trust is also declining. There is a now a cultural vaccum in society which has been filled with consumerism, but that is not sustainable."

Western culture is destroying itself without replacing it with something new, and this has had, and will continue to have very deletrious effects, until we find a new way forward.

The problem is, they have little to no real world experience, so they are not able to differentiate between what they ""know"" and how things ACTUALLY work. This is something you can't learn in school or by sitting in front of a computer.

Many boomers grew up without a tv, or if they did have one, it was black-and-white. They grew up without computers, cell phones and the internet. If they wanted to know something they had to go find a book, drive or walk kilometers to a library when it was open, and actually open and read a book.

I do not have a negative view of relationships and I think love is good, but it also isn't exclusively tied to having a romatic partner. I think relationships are difficult and that it is best not to rely too much on them as a source of personal happiness, but to each his own.

The ""just do it"" attitude was given to me for years, and I also thought it was stupid. It is extremely hard to do, but it does work, once you figure how to do it. I wasted many years of my life due to this.

Yea, you could, if you abuse it. If your life and happiness revolve around food you'll end up unhealthy. Eating a balanced, moderate diet, on the other hand, is a good thing.

I never said it was ALL shitty, I said there are SOME shitty things, and it might be good to be aware of them.

I did skate intensly for the whole 30 minutes though, without breaks, and it was at a park with big bowls. I would be pooped for a few days after that.

As of today I can go about 3-5 times week and do 3-4 hours of good skating with some breaks thrown in. My leg muscles have visibly grown a lot. I still have a long way to go, but I feel like in a few months I could probably skate everyday. I also have hip arthritis so I have to be careful not to hurt that.
