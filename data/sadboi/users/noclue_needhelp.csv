Also the screen does still work just fine. When the device is turned on it only has a line or two at the bottom and then a few seconds later the screen slowly looks like what is shown. I couldn't find anything about this happening on this device, but I know it's happened to other smok devices."

SuicideWatch,exrrol5,t3_cu6cwx,1566522423.0,"In my own personal experience, it's not as easy as you may think. You tend to hesitate once you're about to take your own life and in return leaves you worse off. I'm not going to give you options as it wouldn't really be the right thing to do on my part, but I also won't try and change your mind because that's for you to decide. I've attempted more than once and every time I end up being saved and in hospital. I have a long history of mental health due to trauma and BPD etc and I like to help people as much as possible, but not everyone wants help. Sometimes it's just nice to hear somone else speak about it from experience. I'm in no way 100 % still, but I'm getting there and hopefully you will to. Peace and love with you my friend no matter what you decide ‚úåÔ∏è"
