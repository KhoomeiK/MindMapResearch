Congrats on the baby! 
My first delivery in 1988 I had a botched episiotomy (sp) at a teaching hospital and couldn't walk. Three days later (at home) my stitches ripped and I felt immediate relief. At my week check up, my doctor that didn't make it to my delivery, restitched me. ü•∫ We moved across country when our baby was just over 6 weeks. I didn't know I had an infection, I just knew I couldn't  have sex because it hurt. All my older sisters said it was just in my head and have a glass of wine. 6 months later at my annual my doctor put ne on antibiotics...it wasn't a weeping infection and there was no odor. 
I would go through that again for my first born...he made me a grandma almost 2 years ago. üòÄ"
