The biggest difference is to keep in mind that manic episodes CAN happen and that's especially important when considering medications because SSRIs can cause manic episodes. 
But in short, if you have had any manic episodes, you'll always have the diagnosis. Ig you're feeling more regulated after taking meds they have probably helped your brain chemistry regulate!

It's good that you're aware of WHY you are feeling this way though, because that's the first step and improving your quality of life in general. As hard as it is I super highly recommend seeing a psychiatrist and coming up with a treatment plan with a professional. 

Taking medication can help keep you from dipping too high or low and either way it would be good for you to talk to a professional in order to keep track of your mental health and find what coping skills work best for you. Generally they'll give you an antidepressant for depression and anxiety symptoms (SSRIs most commonly) and an antipsychotic for manic episodes (like lithium or lamictal). Of course this depends on your diagnosis and other factors but to prevent bipolar from getting worse it is recommended that you take medication if you can. 

I hope this is helpful and I wish you the best, dont give up!"
Drugs,f44z3c1,t1_f44u5j6,1571362106.0,"There are 14 receptors in the brain so they are pretty much all activated by SSRIs and each person's body and chemistry just responds differently. 

As far as I've seen it's not exactly known which receptors really make a difference (if it was known it wouldn't be as trial and error and would be pretty revolutionary lol) but this article and chart breaks everything down pretty well!

Drugs,f44sfan,t3_djf4ey,1571357973.0,"I'm pretty sure the difference is how specifically they target serotonin receptors. For example, Zoloft is very general and targets the receptors in your brain and your stomach, which would cause nausea and related side effects, while there are others that have the opposite effect of preventing nausea because they target a different set of receptors. 

And they all effect people in different ways so potency is very dependent on the individual because of varying brain chemistry, reactions to medication, etc.

Definitely good that you're going to the doctor to rule out anything physical but it could definitely be from anxiety.

mentalhealth,f1q1td0,t3_daihf0,1569691941.0,"As far as I know mood stabilizers are prescribed to people affected with things like bipolar, alongside ssris. Since ssris can trigger manic episodes the diagnosis and treatment have to be different compared to someone with straight depressive disorder. I'm not sure what the case is with other disorders since this is just from my experience. 

The way ssris work is that they basically don't allow serotonin to be absorbed back into the body and instead forced it to flood your serotonin receptors, which leads to improved moods and lessened anxiety for some people. Mood stabilizers (like lamictal or lithium) help keep you from dipping too low or too high. 

Also it's very trial and error, one thing might work amazing for one person and feel like absolute shit to another so you have to be patient if you do decide to try medication. It depends in your personal symptoms and diagnosis what your psychiatrist might recommend but don't be afraid to voice your concerns and ask any questions you have about it. 

I'm not a professional but I've done research since I've been prescribed such things so I hope this is somewhat helpful. (:"
