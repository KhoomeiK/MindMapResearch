lonely,fj2wuo1,t3_fav1l7,1582956891.0,"Wrong time and place to approach a girl. Tbh as a girl it can be quite frustrating. Guys don’t seem to realise that when we’re working or shopping or studying or going about our daily business the last thing we want is to be asked out. There are signals and the right time and place, like at a bar (but not always... you can tell if someone is open to being approached or not). 

And another annoying thing while I’m thinking of it, please don’t lie... it makes it even less attractive than being asked out when you don’t want to be. So many times guys have pretended to want directions or something else and used it as a way to ask me out... just please don’t. You just ruined your chances of ever dating that person if you do that.

You will be rejected 99% of the time if you ask out people like this and approach them when they don’t want to be."
relationships,fislsbb,t3_f9ct24,1582687406.0,"I agree with some people here that the main thing wrong with his behaviour is expecting you to figure out getting home after he changed his plans on you. I think sometimes we do just want to spend time with our friends on spontaneous plans, and maybe it would be a bit hurtful if you were already planning to spend time together, but I’m sure if your girls invited you out somewhere last minute, you’d like to be able to change your plans too. 

But what I don’t understand is why he couldn’t just drop you back at his place first. That’s common decency and would have been the least he could do changing plans last minute. And then getting upset with you and making u get an Uber is just not cool. If he really couldn’t spare any time he should order and pay for that Uber himself, and apologise for changing plans, not be mad at you. 

I also think you’re both young, and given that this is your first relationship it’s going to be a good learning experience for future partners, and for yourself, about what you feel you deserve and how you will communicate this to others, and what to look for in a new partner. 

If it were me, I would give him a chance to explain himself and apologise and see what he has done wrong, and be open with communication. If he’s not convinced that he did anything wrong, and won’t communicate with you openly and calmly, I think it’s time to express to him that you don’t want to be with someone who behaves this way and then can’t see the wrong, or take responsibility. Good luck! :)"
