I feel like the term is relevant for when you're a child below the age of 10, which then gradually transforms into something vague and unrecognizable. in my opinion, atleast I'd say people come and go and you learn a lot and have some great moments with them, while each of them contribute to your life to help us become the bets versions of ourselves. it's a sad reality where you can't promise yourself to be in strong relations with someone you consider a close friend, cuz the future is honestly, uncertain.
