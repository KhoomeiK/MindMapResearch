""no one goes to those places for fun (lol), they all have a reason to go to such a place"".
Therapy aside, for what I've tried:
1. Give instead of ask for what you want. I got into videos and articles about vulnerability, facing shame, connection, etc. So rather than asking for that, I gave it. I tried it with the friends I already had and it completely shifted the relationship and we are very close now. It's a matter of listening, not judging and asking questions.
2. Philosophically, we are always alone. The School of Life has a great video on how we are ""fated to be lonely"", it's fantastic. It also has videos about deepening connections with other people.
The point of the video is that we may never find the right people to connect. The may never exist, live on the other side of the world or died in the 15th century. And art is an option. Art (as the video puts it) it's the call of the artist's inner world, a call who found no one close to be heard. But maybe through art, a book, a painting, it may one day find the right person, even if apart by miles or centuries.
Idk hope it's useful."
Anxietyhelp,fneubjc,t3_g15av3,1586895981.0,"Oh yeah, you're under a lot of stress. Like, I'm just getting out of a 10 month streak of that. It's like your mind is made of bees, or foam, you literally can't think spontaneously. 
It's stress and a repressed feeling. (it was for me). I was avoiding lots of thoughts and feelings after my ex threatened to kill himself. The thing is that those things don't disappear, they want to be heard. And they linger until they're looked at and accepted. The stress I felt was due to the panic those feelings and thoughts provoked in me. I was trying to hold a door closed, and they were trying to get through. It's exhausting.

I've read a little bit about psychology, and it has to do with how our brain transforms ideas into automatic thoughts. Ideas that we are taught are true, we experience them as true (by living or doing them) and we associate with a feeling we can recognize, are moved to the ""automatic"" section of the brain. We don't have to consciously think and do them. Like breathing, or putting on shoes, or chewing.
Conflict with an idea or experience is shunned out by the brain. From mild ones to trauma. It makes us feel insecure and scared because it's messing up with our idea of the world and what it ""should"" be. We are constantly trying to process that inner conflict and at the same time pushing it out of consciousness. It makes us stressed, tense, depressed. 
The way out is stop pushing it away. Process the experience, change whatever the conflict may be (it's one fo two: your previous ideas about the world or how you view the event itself).
Shit hits the fan very easily doing this :v exercise and meditation help too."

IWantToLearn,fg1zb3b,t3_ew1ay7,1580435483.0,"There are lots of weird advice in the responses. Like, people giving concrete advice on how they detached from their specific attachments (which are not the same for everyone), or how they stopped giving a fick about it (which is not detachment) or to smoke weed lol. 
Attachment it's in its core a reliance on something outside of us to fill an inner emotional need. It's a real need, it won't go away, so we seek it relentlessly if we believe it's outside of us. It sounds like spiritual bs, but we do have everything we need inside of us. And it gets very complex as you start to untangle your inner needs. Childhood traumas and toxic relationships and cognitive disorders start popping up. But there is a ""1 fits all"" solution in the end. 
I'll give some examples.
1. Attachment to a partner/expartner. Need:love, solution: self love. Imagine that we weren't very loved as children. We didn't learn to make ourselves feel loved (as this things are mostly learned by our parents, our first relationship). And in our teens we meet someone that makes us feel loved. Love is a real psychological need. So of course we'll get super attached to them. We'll feel like we are dying if they leave, because a basic emotional need is at play. The solution is not on what you do or don't do about the other person, or what she or he does. The solution is to learn to love ourselves, to detach we need to stop believing that ""love"" is found in that person. That way we can tolerate any distance from them. And with a cool head no longer held hostage by the crippling fear of dying of the other person leaves, we are finally free to happily work on the relationship or end it and happily walk away. 
2. Attachment to anxiety. Need:safety, solution:self responsibility. When we feel anxious, I once saw in a video to ask myself: What am I using this anxiety for? We are anxious beings by nature, it's super OK. But what we fail to realize is that we use it to cover up scarier stuff in order to avoid it. And being anxious of the future usually covers up the immense fear of the present, at least for what I've seen. It's so much easier to fear something in the future that we can't do anything about now than being properly scared of something in the present that we could do something about. The fear of failure, the illogical yet real fear that we will die if we fail, the existencial terror that comes with choosing a path for our lives, the feeling that we don't know. Those are proper terrors, not the anxiety of the future. That one feels safe in comparison. We have a need to feel safe as we go through life, and anxiety in the future (future as if ""future"" itself is ""something outside of us"") is our outside unreliable source. In the future those fears are no more. We have won already in the future. We don't need to face the terrors of the present then. 
The solution is self responsibility for our lives. To be self reliant and to take conscious action from an inner conviction. Again, is something forged inside of us. It's closely related to self love and compassion for oneself. Understanding that one would rather die for real than letting the terrors stop them. When the fear of not doing anything triumphs over the fear of doing something badly. That is something I'm tackling now in my life BTW. 
3. I'm tired, I guess those 2 examples are enough. 

So basically we need to understand our needs, localize the thing outside of us we are relying on, and switch to an inner mental approach to solve them. Beware, we are just human, we might identify the wrong need, apply the incorrect solution or make some mistake. It's trial and error for each person. 
Meditation, exercise, therapy, cbt, self help books help. And most importantly, having a CONCRETE purpose can push us through the hard parts. It's the task of a lifetime, to understand ourselves and to properly be alive. But the rewards are beyond amazing. It helps with relationships (love, family, friends), lifestyle, and overall peace and happiness."

That seems wildly aggressive to me. If it helps of course use it, but I had another approach.

I would agree with anything the voice said.
""you're fat"" and I'll calmly respond ""sure, I am""
""you're not good enough"" - ""I guess I ain't""
""nobody loves you"" - ""oh well, nobody is obligated to"".

My T told me to respond with calm and a lot of cynisism. As if in saying internally ""you know that is not true, so let them say whatever they want, it means nothing next to your inner convictions"".

It felt weird at first, like I wanted to cry and laugh at the same time. Later I understood what that was about.
The inner voice is a little part of us that is trying to keep us safe. At some point in our lives we associated feeling love or feeling safe with the feelings that voice summons when we hear it.

As I kept responding like this, both to my inner voice and other people in my life, my awareness grew. Then I could see it. The owner of that voice. It was my inner child, it was a beaten-up, crying, sacared child repeating what he was once told. At least in my case. Then I could hug him and do all that inner child work thingy in therapy lol. 

And in the end that translated to the outside. When I'm feeling in that cynical place I no longer argue with people, the things they say don't affect me anymore and I just agree with whatever they have to say. They need it. I can see it now, when nasty things come my way, it's almost like I can see the person as a sad, beaten-up child. And I can have pity and compassion for them rather than anger or fear. 

It totally changed my relationships, my friends became closer, my narcissistic family stopped in their tracks (doing the cynical thing kinda returns the shame back to them) and now we even have a healthy relationship.

We all have anxiety for various reasons in our lives, cannabis and thc ""satiate"" that anxiety for a bit, but once the effect is gone it comes back, and this time with extra sources of anxiety (the addiction to the relief effect).
I noticed this after I began therapy, mindfulness training, excersice and meditation after a mental breakdown. I was feeling super good and peaceful and loving. And when I hitted it, it just felt awful, like if I was biochemically provoquing me anxiety.

I closed my accounts as well. I got into mindfulness and realized that fb and ig just gave me anxiety and messed up my reward center of the brain. Left for 6 months, didn't missed them a day.
I had to open fb again, as I moved to a new town and needed to join the local groups for housing, furniture, etc. So I erased all my 1100 friends save for 8 close friends. Also left every group and stopped following most fb pages (memes and stuff). It works the same. Mindfulness helps, maybe with other aspects of adhd too."

selfhelp,ff821o0,t3_es10xn,1579663932.0,"Sharing pain is vulnerability, and it's the key to forging relationships with others. However there are unfortunate ways to be vulnerable, such as when vulnerability lacks boundaries, or it's a demand to be rescued. The school of life is a channel on YouTube with videos on the topic, check them out. 
Wait for the pain to happen. I had a similar struggle when my ex threatened suicide and shattered my mental health. For months there was absolutely nothing I wanted to do with any of my friends other than start screaming, crying and rolling on the floor. Of course I didn't do it, no friend deserves to be put in such a position as to witness that. The solution was to process my own pain. Once talking about it had no more emotional charge, I could share it with others normally or talk about other things."

psychotherapy,feygtby,t3_eqqohn,1579445337.0,"I just got my first job and I'm very excited about it, even tho it's not the best paid job in the world and will require me to move to a super small town away from all my friends and family. I truly look forward to it. From a client's perspective:
1. I complained a lot in the past while I was in therapy. Just like your client. For me it was just victim mentality and a lack of self love. In the end if the client doesn't want to get better, the client won't. The client will just push against anything you give him in that state. What my T did anytime I complained (as in making myself a victim, making excuses, etc.) was to look in my eye and calmly say: ""well, yeah"". Like it was the most obvious and normal thing in the world.
That stopped me dry and seeing her calm made me realize that I had options and agency, no matter what. Seeing her calm and teasing me that way helped my mind to calm down and let go of the grip around my excuses.
2. Death. Maybe some pessimism can help, like thinking about not having arms and being unable to do even the worst job out there.
3. The School of Life has very good ideas on the topic. A quiet life, meaningful work, etc.

askpsychology,feogdwp,t3_eq4aaz,1579299776.0,"I (not a professional nor student) think that the human brain on its various levels of abstraction and analysis (both consious and unconsious) needs to constantly define (and update this definition) ""what *it* is"". I think it might do this in order to better understand itself and its place in the world in order to properly try to survive, adapt and thrive in it. We are one of the few species that evolved self-awareness.
I think this makes sense from an evolutionary point of view, given the power of the human brain. Even tho I'm not an expert lol.
Self-esteem might rise as a need because if we constantly think about ourselves as unfit for our social group, unable to thrive in the world, unable to form meaningful connections, etc., we fail to adequately analyze ourselves and our environment. We fear agression where there is none, stress levels get higher, we are worse abled to form social and emotional connections, etc. Which is not very conductive to a fullfilled life. 
Idk, that's what I've thought about the issue."

I was in session and she told me she cancelled all her appointments (due to the physical pain) after mine, because I was one of her favorite clients. She said that she saw my name in her agenda, and told her secretary to cancel everything after my session that so she could go home and rest :3

TalkTherapy,fcsygzg,t3_eingiq,1577928281.0,"I've been on your side of the question. My T asked me that, alongside:
1. Why do you like being a victim?
2. Why do you insist on being angry at your parents?
""That's what you've told me for the last 4 months"" she said. It's fucking infuriating. I had my sessions scheduled every 2 weeks and for those 2 I was pissed off at her. 
And yet, something changed in me as I faced those questions. It's unconfortable to admit, but being a victim is a very safe position to be in. You relinquish all responsibility about your own well being and put it into others' hands. 
It's not about blaming the victim. It's about admitting that nasty shit happens to all of us, and that it's ok to feel bad about it. But that nobody but ourselves can do something about it. It's how we grow up, define our values and become adults. 
She was right. And she handled it very good as a therapist. Idk about other Ts, but those questions should only be asked when the client is ready to face them (as she told me I was). 
It's not wrong to feel like a victim, in fact it is necessary to cope with a lot of things, but we should be aware that it's a tool of our brains, and we shouldn't over use it. 
She then told me the next session to ask myself whenever I feel bad, ""Am I making myself the victim?"" followed by ""Am I enjoying it?"". It helps to put things into perspective. 
It sucks to be confronted by that the first time, but only with that anger can we push through our helpessness and take responsibility for our minds and lives. Nowadays I ask myself that question constantly, and sure enough if I still feel good being a victim, I'll continue and I'll enjoy it. Only well aware at some point I will have to take action."

You might find use in being hard on you now, but try to forgive yourself. Those behaviors come from wounds we have from our pasts. If you're beating yourself up the wound won't reveal itself. But if you can be kind to yourself, the wound will reveal and there you have a chance to heal it. And once it heals you will radically change. Therapy would be helpful I think.

Meditation,f9v4h2w,t3_e6tmke,1575662977.0,"Yeah, the ego is a natural mechanism of the human psyche. 
My T explaied it to me like a series of concentric circles, in the center lays lile the ultimate spiritual level completely ego-less and super transcendental and stuff, and further from the center lay less developed or more basic levels of spiritual/psychological/emotional stages. We can absolutely go to the center, but we can't and shoudn't try to stay there forever. It's a place to put things into perspective, free from the restrictions of the ego. 
But in that place we don't wonder about our obligations, our reallity, our jobs or what we are going to eat tomorrow. We have to step down from there to go back into our lives.
Rather than free ourselves from our egos, a flexible and adaptive ego would be more desirable. One that is open to change and transform over time, and that is better at adapting to the different challenges that come over our lives."
AskReddit,f9v2ejf,t3_e719kg,1575661938.0,"The ""Animo!"" (I think it translates as ""cheer up"") guy. From Queretaro, Mexico, he used stand in the back of a yellow pick-up truck, that read ""animo ecuÃ¡nime"" (something like """"cheer up"" for anyone and everyone"") while it drove through the city. 
From there he would yell to people on the street ""animo!"", ""cheer up!"" with a huge smile and as energetic as person can get. It was very cool, if you were lucky and got yelled at directly, you couldn't help but to laugh or smile. 
I think it had a sad backstory, I heard once that he did that because his wife told him to cheer up just before she died. I don't know if that last part is true, it's just what I heard once and could be gossip.

selfhelp,f9sfoqj,t3_e6lkrh,1575591523.0,"The basis of strong relationships is vulnerability. When someone witnesses your vulnerable sides and treats them with compassion, boy it feels great. And when it's both ways, that's when intimacy comes in. 
Anyone can admire perfection. Famous people have tons of strangers admiring and loving them and they are close to none of them. Strenght sure looks cool, but it's vulnerability what makes us cherish someone
It's of course a cautious step to take. It can have drawbacks. It starts sharing a little and seeing how another responds. Be judgment free around them so that they feel confident to do the same. And of course, not everybody responds well to it. You can get hurt. It's ""vulnerability"" after all. 
I have done it. It works. And it's very freeing feeling that you are with someone you can trust. My friends have told me about the times their parents died, their breakups, their fears and their regrets. It's not about fixing anything; it's just about being allowed to feel those things in presence of someone who is not panicked, grossed or angered by them.
Alain the Botton has very good videos about it in a Youtube Channel called ""The School of Life"". You should check the videos about friendship."

I had a minor breakdown after a break-up last year. I ended up in therapy for 10 months, and I healed and moved on and all that good stuff. I learned a lot about relationships, self-care and overall maintaining good mental health. 

The thing is that when I talked to my friends about their relationship problems, most of what I learned in therapy applied to them as well. Seems to me there are some basic skills nobody teaches that help us navigate this moments in our life. If you can give it a go.

In my case I think (My T never gave me my diagnosis) is a repressed trauma, minor depression and negative self-talk. And I think this because as I worked my way through those on the course of 10 months of therapy it receded drastically. I was super focus and aware. Meditation and exercise might have helped too.
I remember the monent vividly. I had been taking care of my inner chatter and self-love. I was taking a walk in a solitary place and from a gentle, calm place of tranquility it just popped into my mind ""I want to study psychology"". For context that was the first time in years that I was able to trust myself and listen to what I and only I wanted for myself. For me. For my own sake. I'd have to give more unnecessary details for a full picture, but the gist of it is that after dealing with a lot of shit for the past year, healing and crying a shit ton, I was finally just ok. 
I think that the foggyness is a form of denial or avoidance, at least in my case. So just strenghthen your psyque so that those thoughts can feel safe enough to come through. Idk."

Suicide has this super tragic meaning nowadays but it wasn't always the case. There is no moral obligation to keep on living an unbearable life, or just a life for that matter. It's a wise choice to end it all if there is really no better alternative. We all die anyway lol. 
The sad thing for me is when people mistakenly think that there are no other options when there are. The possibilities are almost unlimited. There is so much we can try. I see people with severe disabilities, missing limbs, chronic deseases, victims of war and violence, etc. thriving and smiling and I just can't help to think that there is something else to life. That they know something I don't. I have health, legs, arms, a functional brain and I live in a developed country. I'm way better off than them. The world is basically mine. And it's the same for other people. There is so much we can try before admitting that suicide is the only option left. We can move to another country, switch jobs, leave our families and friends behind and enter a monastery in Nepal for decades to find the meaning of life. Or whatever.
In the end I don't think suicide is a mistake or something bad, but we can do it any day. There are things we might try before doing it. And as I see it in the smiles of people who have endured worse adversities than I, there might be something here that I haven't figured out yet. And if I can't find it after trying it all, well seems that killing myself is perfectly wise decision."
