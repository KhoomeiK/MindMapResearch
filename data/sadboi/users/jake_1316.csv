There are going to be numerous people that don't understand, peers, teachers, your parents, just know that it's not because of anything you've done. All I can offer in the way of advice; prioritize your health, both physical and mental. Do what makes you feel good, keep a healthy sleep schedule and make sure to eat regularly. Everything gets harder if you aren't physically healthy. 
Given that counseling isn't for you, I suggest journaling. Just as a way to process negative emotion.
