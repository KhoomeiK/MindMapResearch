i get panic attacks a lot. generally, i can't breathe and i kinda overload and shut down. your panic attacks may not be like mine at all, and sadly i can only give you advice on how to deal with what i deal with. so if this isn't helpful, i apologize in advance.

the first thing i have to remember to do is breathe. i need to block out my surroundings enough that i can take a deep breath. i close my eyes to do this. somtimes i cover my ears, but if i'm in public i usually avoid it because judgy people. if i'm in school (which happens a lot, crowds trigger mine) i turn up the volume on my music. then i take a few deep breaths. it doesn't start out deep, but as i keep doing that they get deeper. 

if i get to a full shutdown point, i drink water. it's weird but it works in kinda the same way throwing cold water on an unconscious person wakes them up.

also, as a preventative thing, i take walks or go for a run. it takes my mind off of anything that could potentially trigger a panic attack, and also there's some scientific thing about how dopamine is released, idk, i'm a high schooler and that's beyond my knowledge spectrum. 

so those are my three not at all general tips for panic attacks and maybe you can use them. i think the main thing would be to take your mind off of whatever it is, and i know that's hard and me saying that isn't helpful in any way. but that's the bottom line."
