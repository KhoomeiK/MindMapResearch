GTAV,fpjt0op,t3_gdwd71,1588680157.0,"I agree, now would be a good time to invest the $30 into criminal enterprise starter pack if you’re able to. It includes and office and motorcycle club so you can get started building your enterprise. You get A LOT of stuff in the starter pack, including cars, properties, and $gta. If you already have bought it, you should be able to redeem a free office on maze bank foreclosures. 

If you don’t wanna buy the starter park, work toward and office to become CEO. You have to be a CEO to run businesses and make money. You might have to work as an associate for others to make money too. Take advantage of any double or triple $gta / rp they offer, especially racing. Even the worst racer can make 70-100k an hour racing with double money offered."

gtaonline,fpg8eal,t3_g7zl46,1588597037.0,"You have to buy a business through motorcycle club and assign the tech to those goods. The bunker is one of those businesses you can assign a tech too, so if you have a bunker you should assign a tech to sports goods. To do this, use the computer at nightclub. 

When buying the businesses through motorcycle club, you have to use motorcycle club computer. 

Cocaine business and meth through the motorcycle club. The passive stock accrues at a higher $/min rate and can make money stocking and selling each independently. There’s a chart you can google that shows each business and how much it accrues each hour passively. Just google gta5 online motorcycle club nightclub income or something. 

If you haven’t bought criminal enterprise starter pack for $30, and can afford to, I would encourage you to do it because it comes with a lot of “free” stuff in GTA online you can use to get started. 

You also have to be online for stock to accrue."
