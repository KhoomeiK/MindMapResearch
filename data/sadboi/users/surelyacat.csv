I'd also add a bedspread (is that what it's called?) in the same theme, to add color and create unity, also maybe add some extra pillows for decoration.

A nice nightlight or standing lamp in the corner will also create a bit more atmosphere. And plants are always easy style makers!"

Not saying that's due to the epidural. But that is (at least partially) due to the medical professionals who's opinion you hold so highly.

Theres a crisis in the US on pregnancy related deaths. So I do not want to hold the opinion of the US medical professionals to a higher standard than those where I live.

On sites where they compare the cons and pros of epidurals the con list remains longer than the pro list.

I for one don't like opiods (or any chemicals) in my system, ever. So if I can avoid that I would like to try to.

It's mostly frowned upon because there can be complications with an epidural. It's chemicals entering your body, it's an official medical procedure that comes with risk. So if it's avoidable, doctors here believe it should be avoided.
