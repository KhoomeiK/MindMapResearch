Too bad my heart doesnt agree.."
BPDmemes,fr254hz,t3_gm46un,1589831314.0,"SO. EFFIN'. FRUSTRATING.

Either getting shit on for arguing when simply explaining, shit on for always explaining myself when ""I don't have to"" or shit on for being silent/having an attitude cause everytime I open my mouth.. I'm getting shit on.

Smh..

FUCK.. MY LIFE. Ugh."

I'm honestly at a complete loss. Been since middle of March since we broke up and it's just not getting easier in any way."
StimSisters,fqp534z,t3_gjyfza,1589535321.0,"Smoking. Only other way I've tried is snorting (hot rails and otherwise). I love the ritual and watching the smoke curl inside the pipe.

Cons.. I'm careless af and have burned myself (never anything or anyone else at least) bad enough to leave scars more times then I care to admit.. Ouch!"
BPD,fqp1tpr,t3_gjwy7t,1589531999.0,"I've had the same thoughts (also just contemplation with no plan of action or intent). I had them alot more often when I was younger (teens - mid 20s) but they've gotten fewer and further between. But.. if there's an event I where I preceive betrayal, abandonment etc by someone I've let close to me.. those thoughts can floord back with such intensity I've literally puked or almost passed out."

Its a pretty surreal feeling to want to go home when you are home.. I havent felt ""at home"" in my surroundings in so long that it feels as though home is nowhere and safety and stability are foreign, fairytale concepts. Ugh."
StimSisters,fqjukbq,t3_gj6rzi,1589415412.0,"I get this on so many levels. Honestly? Im a little (alot! lol) envious that you found that connection irl! I havent ever had that yet.

Embrace it! :D Happy for you!"

I can only imagine what you had to do to get the color so perfect.. Did you have to take any extra precautions or do any ""damage control""? Im always curious as to how people manage to have healthy hair after this kind of dye job. (Im STILL paying for one I did almost four years ago..)"
