atheism,f3xb4a8,t1_f3x5awl,1571235259.0,"I told her this, if the bible was written by god through his blessed scholars, why didn't they measure the earth right and just said it's ""spherical"". Why the weird measurements, dates and time? When ancient civilizations have already standardized it? I told her, we have found ways learning that we have planets and saw them, but how did they know the difference of a star and a planet back then? God never mentioned that in the bible. He didn't even know we had planets. And god measured the earth wrong too."
