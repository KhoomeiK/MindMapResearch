benzorecovery,fa9bykl,t1_fa9b6ua,1575868233.0,"Thanks, I appreciate that. I spent 3.5 years on Zoloft and half a year on Prozac, I think it helped me feel less suicidal but I couldn‚Äôt function, didn‚Äôt enjoy anything, gained a lot of weight. The Zoloft numbed me out, I would just zone out because it would stop working and they‚Äôd increase the dose. Tried Prozac but it made me wake up feeling like I was having a heart attack... did a long tapering on/off process for both. The psychiatrist was basically a joke, a 30 minute video chat where we basically talked about nothing and they handed me scripts. I stopped going to try no meds+psychologist for talk therapy.  Now I‚Äôm back to nothing and just have a leftover Xanax prescription that I‚Äôve been milking 

My job is changing our insurance in 2020 so I‚Äôm going to lose my psychologist too because I can‚Äôt afford seeing him as frequently 

I think I just need something that isn‚Äôt addictive to help me sleep for now... might consider another psychiatrist if I can find one on my new insurance taking patients. Just need to wait a month.

I think each type of plastic surgery is different psychologically so I probably shouldn‚Äôt lump them all together.

Edit: just my personal opinion and open to changing it. To answer your question my gut reaction to teenage Botox is ‚Äúyikes‚Äù because when I was a teenager it was only considered something for when you age... I‚Äôm so old I didn‚Äôt realize teens were doing it now"

Source: I had a nose job. I have friends who had it done when they were in HS and they look great. It‚Äôs not a huge deal. Everything has risks associated with it."
AmItheAsshole,fa7dqwr,t3_e7sg90,1575833776.0,"YTA 

I had a nose job and it was the best thing I ever did. I wanted one from age 14 my parents said no and then I saved up several thousand dollars and did it myself, but I had to wait until I was 24 to save that much. I wish I did it earlier because it makes the transition easier (time goes on, other people forget - if you‚Äôre self conscious about that kind of thing). When I was in high school, one of my girlfriends did it. I still see her around today and she looks amazing. 

Sorry you had a shitty doctor (my aunt had a bad nose job and has a deformed nostril), but you can go to a better one this time? It doesn‚Äôt sound like money is the issue? There‚Äôs always risk... 

Have her see a therapist first or something if you‚Äôre worried about body dysmorphia... make sure she understands the risks etc. but certainly don‚Äôt project your own experience in to her. If you‚Äôre not doing the latter then I‚Äôd lean towards NAH

Maybe at least give her a concession that if she goes through the steps, she can get it between high school / college... but likely a doctor WILL do this on a 16 year old..üòÅ"
