Second, I would look into different childcare options for your daughter. Your husband is neglecting her. Diaper rashes can lead to horrible infections. He has put her health at risk because he wants to play video games. 

Third, things need to change in your home. Your husband either needs to change his behaviors, or you need to get ready for life as a single mother. It honestly seems like doing it alone would be easier than having to also raise a third child.

I know I had to leave and take our baby daughter with me, but didn‚Äôt know when. He attacked me that night, and I had to wrestle a shotgun away from him. That was my ‚Äúwhen.‚Äù Packed up our things and left as soon as he passed out."

Most states don‚Äôt have equations like that for spousal support. She wouldn‚Äôt be asking for 50% of his income either. Considering that she gave up her own career for him, I hoped that he would be thoughtful of that, but it doesn‚Äôt appear that he is."

Keep on living and growing into the best version of you. Your parents must be so proud, because I know I am!"
