opiates,fqj2on7,t1_fq5s3i4,1589404227.0,"I only just saw this reply then but I wanted to thank you for giving me such a long and detailed response. I could relate to a lot of the things you said and it's helping to change my perspective on everything.

I could relate to the trauma part, my parents used to argue a lot when I was a kid and had an abusive relationship. I never thought it affected me much when I was younger but now I realise it probably did contribute to some of the issues I have now. 

They got divorced when I was 6-7 years old and honestly I'm glad they did. If they had stayed together I think it would have really messed me up as a child. I never thought of what I went through as trauma but recently I've realised it did have a big impact on me. After the divorce things were really rough and tense for a few years but things eventually got better and now they're in
a much better place mentally.

I also went through a lot of bullying and constant mental health issues as a teen and I know that's had a huge impact on me for years. 

I fully agree with what you said about benzos. Xanax has caused me the most problems out of any drug I've used and even though it helped me 95% of the time some of my biggest regrets have been things I did while blacked out on Xanax. I've never had any problems with Valium or Klonopin but I know they're not the solution for my anxiety. I'm trying to cut down sometime soon and try to only use them when I really need them.

I've decided I will go on Suboxone because it's a much better option compared to me using heroin, oxys, methadone etc. I've also applied to get a prescription for low thc-high CBD weed because of the benefits I've had from CBD in the past.

There's a lot of fucked up shit that's happened in my life that I didn't mention  because I don't think its necessary for me to go into every little detail but I will aim to try and focus on the future and improve my life in anyway I can.

I will definitely cut down on the benzos and alcohol and try my best to get my mental health under control. Thanks again for the reply :)"

I can give you some advice on other ways that help me deal with things a little bit better if you wanted to hear it? Of course nothing is going to be as effective as drugs but if you use particular drugs too often or in an unsafe way they'll become less useful or they can take you down a very dark path which has been the case for me. If you use them responsibly they can be beneficial.

A couple of years ago when I was 21 I got really bad to the point I was using things like meth and painkillers like heroin frequently. I would also drink a lot when I wasn't high on heroin. Nowadays I have constant cravings for all 3 but I'm trying to get things under control.
