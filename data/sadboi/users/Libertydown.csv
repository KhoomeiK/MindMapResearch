If you are speaking of the incident on the 2nd of May 1967 I would love to inform that the black panther group had studied the open carry law very well. Using reporters as a safeguard because they knew that would signify more efficiently that they were well within their rights to do this. Witch they were. Later, in the Reagan administration, a bill was passed, ""the Mulford Act"" also known as the ""Panthers Bill"".

This bill led to stronger gun control. They of course couldn't be charged for a crime committed before the law was in place. So they were locked up for minor crimes later on.

The panthers bill has been cited as a sign that ""The whole 'good guy with a gun' doesn't apply to blacks"" if this leads to stronger gun control. Also Reagan said this law was only natural as it was unnecessary with these violent demonstration when a peaceful alternative was possible.

It's better to stick with playing from as low a position as possible. A C major for instance should be played from an open E and basically using the phrygian mode. Although I don't think of it as phrygian. This makes for instance Eb much more of a friendly key. Most of the time we want to use the bass of the bass and stick as low as possible. When we are playing more advanced we of course want to care more about making it as simple as possible for us to play, but most of the time we are playing parts written by people who are not bassists, and they are written with the bass as a supporting instrument.

This scale works excellently over a 12 bar blues, but that's not all. It also works with other minor based progressions as well.

It's really simple to start off with, but as you continue, you can really develop your own voice with that scale. Clapton uses it aswell as B. B King, but also thundercat and Joe Dart playing beastly. Thundercats strategy of using it is just having the fingerings of it down to a tee and play as fast as he can (16th notes or 8th note triplets).

But some of his solo's are just pentatonic based, although dummy fast. His jazz background is probably his most defining features, he understands chords on bass extremely well. 

Understanding it requires a fair bit of knowledge in theory and understanding how little can you use of a chord to create a chord. Creating a major chord on bass for instance. We want to stay away from that pesky lower interval limit, things get muddy with harmony in bass registers. So we try to spread out the voicings. Playing only the first and the third of the chord is enough to define a triad, the fifth is often the first thing we drop out in harmony because it exists rather loudly within the harmonic series. So a major chord would be for example an F major played as fret 1 on the E string and fret 2 on the G string."

He has held true to that and  before he released his books he was sitting at about 700 000$ considering he's made roughly the same for 40 years, that's a fair bank account. His books amassed royalties over 1 000 000$ and made him a millionaire. Which yes, he has stated he'll pay those taxes if they go up with him, because that is only natural."
JordanPeterson,fi4yoqq,t1_fi4u77i,1582151146.0,"I would love to hear your experiences with transgender people that suggest that they are mentally ill. From the transgender people I've met, they've been nice and really. Most of all, searching for people who accept them.

Facing hatred on the daily and then seeing people disawow your feelings is what makes one spiral into depression. Having the law on your side is a good comforting price to have for all minorities.

I would not say that trans people and other minorities protected by law from hate speech garner any notable privilege from those laws. They don't have the hate speech card as a superpower. This has to go through a jury. Misuse of the court is also a felony.

Hate speech as a law in my humble opinion does not infringe upon free speech. It is classified as such:

A person who uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or displays any written material which is threatening, abusive or insulting, is guilty of an offence if—

(a) he/she intends thereby to stir up racial hatred, or
(b) having regard to all the circumstances racial hatred is likely to be stirred up thereby.

(B) can definetely be debated. British law is not a perfect law. But (A) is pretty clear guidelines as for what you can say.

Free speech allows for me to do plenty of things without treading over the line of A. It makes it so I can't attack someone for their race or in this case gender. However, arguing against your specific argument on the idea that hate speech treads on free speech requires a skewed view of what free speech means. Free speech is a right that exists to allow the media and people to critise those above them. Yadayadaya... French philosophy Voltaire ""To find out who controls you, you must find out who you are not allowed to critise"". Hate Speech is a matter of people saying things to civilians. Who are NOT controlling you and therefore don't need a free speech regulation. 

But the last argument really doesn't change anybodies mind. I used to think the same thing as you, until I actually met more LGBQ and T people and seeing them as humans, not just a description. They ask for basic validation as functional humans. Just watch contrapoints, she makes great content and all, but I suggest to do as you believe you do and keep an open mind, try to see a trans person as a person and see if you still hold your mindset. If you still keep it, sure. You may have a point, but viewing people not through the lens of someone else's view, but your own."

The teen got fined, not imprisoned. This is a decent punishment as the parents get to see their child's misbehaviour and get to do something with it. The article doesn't say where this was. Many countries already have had laws against hate speech for many years. Honestly, great to see them apply their laws to everyone it should apply to.

Edit: It's news UK. It's Britain yes, since 2012 they have had a law against hate speech."
