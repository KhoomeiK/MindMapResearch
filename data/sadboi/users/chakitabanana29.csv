All of this is relative to your own situation and how you feel about her being around you. My dad was super physically and emotionally abusive. He has isolated himself has no friends or family, because they ‘all hate him and do terrible things to him’ when really he’s created these narratives and situations in his own mind. 

My mom was a good person once upon a time. She definitely had her problems and I had to distance myself from her as well. But if she were still here I’d let her meet my kids, no alone time with them of course, but she also wasn’t a narcissistic a-hole who beat me. 🤷🏻‍♀️"

Unless he is willing to do anger management and some SERIOUS therapy and work on his own behavior modification. Things will escalate. There is no off about it. They will, and you’ll get hurt and worst case scenario you’ll die.

You need to leave and separate yourself from him. He’ll beg and plead. This doesn’t mean you absolutely have to end the relationship, HOWEVER: if he is not showing any signs that he’s working to better himself. Drop him. Drop him like the mafia drops people into water with cement bricks tied to their feet, and run, don’t look back, block him on everything.

If he changes that’s great, but honestly it’s probably not going to happen. Take control of your own life. Pack a go bag, disappear. DO NOT tell him where you’re going or who you’re staying with. Make sure when you go pick up your things you take multiple people with you. The more dudes the better. Whatever you do, do not go by yourself. He will beg and plead and say whatever he can to get you to come back to him. Don’t fall for it. 

Please heed this advise and the advice of others. It has the serious potential of being life saving."

askwomenadvice,fjzfntr,t3_ffjmiw,1583718618.0,"Nope. I used to HATE, like utterly disdain him. He was absolutely awful. I refused to have conversations with him because he was mean and angry and just a terrible person to be around. Fast forward a year later, it turns out he was just in an incredibly toxic marriage. He gets a divorce, suddenly he’s a super nice caring man. Eight months later and we were together.

So it wasn’t immediately the right person. Just took a year for the situation to change and for him to be the person he really is. 

Also we’ve been together for four years now and they’ve been the best four years of my life."
dndnext,fjsk4de,t3_feugb3,1583597902.0,"My newest DM allowed us to use anything on the internet that someone had built as long as we got approval. My SO and I were the only ones to take full advantage of this. Tamsin Cephalopada, the Cecilia witch. Think Ursula from the little mermaid. One of the best character builds I’ve done thus far, she’s one of my favorites!"
interestingasfuck,fjpnzzy,t1_fjown8w,1583556071.0,"My uncle had it pretty bad. I’d stay with him while my aunt had out of town trips. EVERYDAY without fail, he’d ask if we could go to Village Inn for breakfast, then as lunch or dinner came around he wanted Long John Silvers. So I’d make it a point to take him to breakfast on Wednesdays for a free slice of pie. He was a great man."
AskReddit,fjplwff,t1_fjnxawl,1583554360.0,This is acceptable.
bipolar2,fjobt6x,t3_fefh95,1583524610.0,Always. I don’t normally spend $300 on one item. But usually my amazon cart is full of many things that can total $300 because 🤦🏻‍♀️
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fjo28t8,t1_fjo1xu9,1583519044.0,For sure! I don’t use a sleep mask and I sleep on my side. I wash my face at the sink with a washcloth and make sure to clean around my eyelids carefully.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fjnmlfo,t3_febn2n,1583510545.0,So it’s a bit expensive but I live by eyelash extensions. I don’t ever feel like I have to ‘get ready’ any more. I don’t wear make up with them as oil deteriorates the glue. But it’s what I do for my self care and a treat for myself.
funny,fjklpf6,t1_fjkh4gt,1583429242.0,"Not at all. I saw just a few pit bites and they were not bad at all. And the ONE that I’ve had from a pit a 3 yo against FOUR pits mix breeds. And she is alive and well. Lots of punctures but no active bleeding and her leg required quite a few stitches. That’s the ONLY one I’ve seen. We get more bull gorings and people who get kicked by horses. 

Btw I work out in the field now and we get more cat scratches than dog bites. 🤣"
funny,fjkare8,t1_fjk7637,1583423624.0,"I’ll agree to disagree. The worst dog bits I ever saw in the ER was from little dogs. We never saw ‘warning’ bites, where they snap and stop. Nope. All the little dog bites were disfiguring. I had a 7yo boy have the entire covering of his top lip ripped off because of a chihuahua. The only bad large breed bite I had was from a Malinois police dog. 

I’ve seen that bigger dogs tend to snap and release, where little dogs usually end up tearing and ripping away at what they bite. 

This is just my personal experience though."
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fjk9fdf,t3_fdw59d,1583422871.0,"I absolutely love kids too. I think they’re wonderful and I want some one day. HOWEVER. I was in this exact situation except I didn’t party so much but I did work nights which had me getting home at 730am and waking up around 3pm-ish. Worst sleep I got in my life. You have no idea how this person is going to parent until you actually live with them. This kid started hitting me, screaming at all hours of the day (I wouldn’t care if I didn’t work that day) she would never take him out of the house to a park or anything she’d just yell at him to be quiet as of that helped. 

You don’t know if you’re even able to have any opinion in the child’s behavior. You also have to understand that unexpected things happen and you run the risk of having the child full time. Shit happens. 

Que new boyfriend. I liked him. He was helpful and nice. He’d clean the house when she wouldn’t. But he was there EVERYDAY. Didn’t pitch in for groceries. I was fine splitting groceries between roommate and her kid. But I’m not here to help feed a grown adult with a better job than we had combined if he’s not going to pitch in at all. 

I know this was my experience but all I can say is DONT DO IT."
Whatcouldgowrong,fjjbydg,t1_fjit6zc,1583389740.0,"Flash floods are called that for a reason. Sometimes unless you get forewarning you’ll get trapped. We get them all the time here in NM the state parks shut off a lot of areas during our rainy season simply for that reason. We can get rain on one side of the mountain, you’d never know because all you can see are blue skies. Then you’re asking yourself why your car is being dragged down the mountain side with water, boulders and trees. 

Mostly it’s our water drainage system that this happens in."
SubSanctuary,fjj64qr,t3_fdackf,1583384424.0,"I see most people here are telling you to report him. I’m not disagreeing with that in the slightest. But it’s your choice. You are the one it happened to you, were all sitting here behind keyboards where it’s easy to tell people what the ‘right’ thing to do is. But here’s the thing NO ONE HERE IS STANDING IN YOUR PLACE. YOU are the only one who is going to have to deal with the consequences of your actions whether or not you decide to go through with this reporting. No one here is going to be there standing beside you following you through this. We can say we stand beside you etc. but in the end you’ll want people legit standing next to you.  You’re the only one who can decide WBA’s right for you, and that’s the only important thing now is that you, take care of you."
family,fji6wrx,t3_fdj0sv,1583361627.0,"I would try to look at this as a blessing. You have the availability of being privileged while also seeing the struggle of normal day to day people. This has probably taught you to be thankful for what you have. 

So your question was how to deal with the wealth gap. You don’t. Your parents are the adults and that’s their responsibility to deal with that. But what you can do is have a sit down conversation with both of your parents, separately. Explain to your mom that she is doing more than enough to care for you, raising you and being a great mom. That the gifts are just that gifts. It cannot compare to the value of her love and the life she’s provided for you. 

Sit down with your dad and explain how the large gestures upset your mom, that she may feel like she’s unable to provide for you all the extras that he’s giving you. She may take this as flaunting. You can also combat this by not telling your mom every single thing he does, or that he gets you. 

I see that your parents don’t get along but maybe you could ask them to sit down and have a polite conversation since they’re both upset over the situation (this is their part to have an adult conversation and try to sort things out) explain to them how it’s effecting you and how you’re not sure how to deal with it. 

It sounds like both parents love you very much and they’re doing the best they can."
Parenting,fjg0181,t3_fd7p3t,1583305829.0,"Consistency and boundaries. Everyone is struggling to figure out where they stand in this new situation. So by giving boundaries and sticking to them it gives her and you as the new parental figure building blocks until things start running a bit smoother. 

11yo are hard regardless, so I can’t imagine what you guys are facing. Just fill your house with love and understanding and it’ll all work itself out in time."
Parenting,fjfv70y,t1_fjfulmp,1583301221.0,This is important. I’m currently on a mission to collect all of these movies. Got our 11yF in on Howl’s Moving Castle. She loves it.

BipolarReddit,fjcepck,t1_fjc0ave,1583217270.0,"Agreed. Had tried 5 different ones. 3 didn’t do anything, Prozac ended with me in the ICU for four days after an overdose, and Amitryptaline gave me the worst hallucinations EVER. For me Lamictal is the best. I haven’t had a depressive state since last summer. By my normal clock work souls have had about 3 by now."
