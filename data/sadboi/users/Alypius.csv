The staff were unwittingly responsible for some of the spread, but passengers also shared circulated air. This is also seen in other cruise ships presently.  


[Similar things happened/are happening in China only with shared sewage systems of low quality.](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-spread-building-pipes.html) If somebody on a higher floor defecates in their toilet as normal and flushes it, two things can happen.


If the defecator flushes the toilet with the lid up, a tiny fecal ploom can waft into the air.

What does this have to do with poor quality sewage systems?

newbrunswickcanada,fmbvfyn,t1_fmbojqm,1585933947.0,"I am not at all suggesting we take medical masks from the people who need them nor am I suggesting there are not risks involved with using masks.


The basic concept behind mask use is this.  ""Your mask protects me, my mask protects you.""


Masks stop droplets from getting out, not from coming in.  Since many people who are infected do not know they are infected until symptoms appear (up to 14days after initial infection), a mask will help prevent people from unknowingly putting droplets in the air in public spaces.


Removing the mask at home after being in public needs to be done with care as it should be considered contaminated."

There is ample scientific evidence to support wearing masks in public.

The reasons are very simple.

-The SARS-COV-2 virus is transmitted primarily through droplets.


-People infected by this virus are still contagious early on and during the incubation period. 


-wearing a homemade mask will prevent droplets entering the environment.


-if everybody wears masks, it will serve as another effective mitigation to prevent the spread if the disease.


Removing the mask is a potential source of infection as it is a fomite.  It needs to be done with care and cleaned immediately along with one's face and hands.



I suggest you think critically about the information you are being given rather than swallow it without question.  The main reason health Canada is saying not to use masks is because they don't want people hoarding medical equipment,  and rightly so.  There is nothing in their rhetoric that says homemade masks are useless.  Do not be surprised if this is mandated soon as it was in Austria,  Italy, and the Czech Republic."
newbrunswickcanada,fmbnwoe,t1_fmbme85,1585929996.0,"There is no need to buy a mask.  They can be made at home easily.  I've made a few posts on this subreddit regarding thi, but they are being downvoted for no apparent reason."
newbrunswickcanada,fmbilje,t3_fu9y1k,1585927092.0,"This is why we need masks for everybody, even homemade masks.


This subreddit is down voting my posts relating to masks.  I have no idea why.  The reality is that people are sick and contagious without knowing.


Masks for everybody would be an excellent mitigation imfor this."
newbrunswickcanada,fmbi306,t3_fu0axg,1585926800.0,"Down voting me because you don't like it doesn't change reality.


The facts are simple and logical.


-masks prevent droplets from going the air.


-people are getting sick and are contagious without knowing.


-masks will reduce the spread further."
