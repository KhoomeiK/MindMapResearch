relationship_advice,fqzu8e0,t3_glmosn,1589775517.0,She's made it a point to talk for over 3 hours tonight...after the argument. I'm completely destroyed now. I will never love again.
relationship_advice,fqzf27g,t1_fqyxveg,1589766017.0,"He's not getting out soon. We actually got into another argument as I was trying to explain my feelings and why I felt the way I did. I feel like she invalidated my feelings...maybe I'm a bit too needy or just selfish and don't want her having male friends. In any case, I'm ready to disengage. My psych can't handle this anymore."
relationship_advice,fqzevgq,t1_fqz91ak,1589765904.0,If I stop paying then I become the bad guy who took one of her only friends away from her. We got into a fight about it. Completely invalidated my feelings. I'm disengaging.
relationship_advice,fqyu57q,t1_fqyjrnc,1589754597.0,"She's very manipulative herself and admits to it. She started the friendship because she had/has a shitty family that more or less made fun of her for love of anime. That's what they have in common. I don't share the interest in anime but encourage her to continue her love for it. He's done some pretty terrible things and blamed it on drugs/alcohol. I agree, she spends a lot of time and energy and money on this dude. He honestly gets more gifts from her than me."
relationship_advice,fqytmto,t1_fqyil9e,1589754359.0,"He does use the payphone. I pay for most of the phone calls. Before the pandemic they were also messaging through a specific program the prison has. The calls are usually an hour and a half long, but twice a day. I really feel like I dish out money and get nothing in return. Just bought her a new phone ($650) and she's mad at me for bringing up this dude. I get it. It almost sounds like I'm accusing her, but that's what it looks like from my point of view."
relationship_advice,fqyt86o,t1_fqyij81,1589754165.0,"According to her, he's been her friend through tough times. She has a pretty shitty family that has always looked down on her for her interest in anime. That is one thing they have in common that me and her don't. I've tried to get into the anime world but she doesn't think I'll understand. I can't say she's wrong but I've tried before. I get the feeling that they truly are just friends but I don't think she's looking at it from my point of view. It looks shady as fuck and with me being an unmedicated bipolar, I can't help but feel like sometimes he takes precedent over me when that's not the case at all. My mind just sees it that way. She is very manipulative and always turns everything against me and makes it my fault. She's openly admitted to her being manipulative. I truly to love this woman and want to marry her, but with my broken mind I'm afraid she's having second thoughts. She's mad at me now because I brought up the issue of the purchase. Reminded me of how I don't like my past brought up and she wants me to quit bringing up this dude."
relationship_advice,fqyrwgl,t1_fqyi4vu,1589753534.0,"We spend all day together watching TV and showing each other memes. There's not much to talk about. I do feel like she's a bit more chatty with him than me, but it's also partly my fault for not initiating conversations. She doesn't necessarily stop what we're doing. If we're out driving or at the store she'll either talk in front of me or tell him to call later."
relationship_advice,fqyg770,t1_fqyfw52,1589748064.0,"I'm not even sure, to be honest. I've only heard that they became pen pals from a high school program but then I know for a fact they wouldn't match a high school kid with a prisoner having his convictions."
relationship_advice,fqyfxp2,t1_fqyfkx9,1589747947.0,"It's odd behaviour but it's most likely my fault because I feel like her giving another dude attention like that is odd. I've never seen it or experienced it in a relationship. We've been together 6 years and we do argue about it at least once a year. I, personally, don't necessarily keep close friends like she does...bad experiences."

Coronavirus,fkish4j,t3_fil7ig,1584227563.0,That's Mike Chitwood lol our Sheriff of Volusia County Florida. He gives zero fucks. Can't decide if I like him or love him but he definitely stirs the pot!
pettyrevenge,fg0thtq,t1_fg0sy8h,1580414706.0,I'm generally a really nice guy unless someone does something blatantly stupid and I just can't hold back. I'm always on the lookout for the REAL delivery peeps and making sure they can do their job with ease....cept Beer trucks...they act like cops.
policebrutality,fg0s90r,t3_ew7pnd,1580414010.0,I am so so so sorry for your loss and this horrible injustice! I can not stand the police anymore. I used to be a full fledged supporter until I opened my eyes to the reality of what is going on in our country. Used to be give respect where respect is deserved but none of those animals deserve an ounce of respect AT ALL! I hope justice is served swiftly to those cowardly bastards and they are stripped of ALL that they hold dearly! Fuck the police!
pettyrevenge,fg0rdv6,t3_ew24uc,1580413524.0,"As a Parking Enforcement Officer, this boils my blood! Tickets aren't enough instant justice to me. Especially when it comes to lazy cops who think just because they're law enforcement they can do whatever they want. I've attempted ticketing a few cops before but was chewed out by my boss. Of course, the cops don't like me now cause they have to explain to their supervisor why they got a ticket for parking on-coming when they could've simply made a u-turn before heading in to see their buddies to have piss fights in the bathroom."

offmychest,f5r0d25,t3_dot1re,1572386029.0,"I am so sorry to hear this. I suffer from BPD. My fiancee and I had it out today. I'm not violent but...reading this has made me realize that at any point and time, it could be me and it horrifies me. Counseling should be your ultimatum to her. I'm going to set mine up first thing in the morning. Bro, while I am extremely heartbroken for you, I must also give you gratitude for sharing. You just saved a relationship and future marriage."
depression,f2i5aq8,t3_ddebro,1570252431.0,"So, at the advice of everyone, I brought it up to her in text. She successfully turned it into my fault and I had to apologize."
depression,f2i2d4s,t3_ddebro,1570251309.0,"You are correct. I already knew the answers/advice that would be given. I've heard it for 4 years. I guess I'm just waiting for an ""ah-ha"" moment from her..."
depression,f2gegkp,t3_ddebro,1570229655.0,"I'm glad someone understands from the other end of the spectrum. I will here your advice... although the last time I stood up for myself, it ended in divorce. That's my fear."
depression,f2g8udg,t1_f2g74vh,1570227849.0,"We're engaged. Been together 5 years. I know everything I have to say and do, but if it causes me to lose her? Causes her to be sad? She suffers from depression. I can't take that risk."
depression,f2g79o1,t1_f2g6r10,1570227286.0,It's not necessarily an agreement. It's my fault. I spoil her way too much. She has worked but can't seem to find the right job that fits her.
depression,f0ufshn,t1_f0tcvvp,1568939598.0,"High five, bro!"
depression,f0ufr8a,t1_f0tbyso,1568939570.0,"And I feel you as well. I'd love to see the world burn, problem is, I'd burn too. I've got so much stress but I can't vent to anyone all the truths. I do some shady shit, but for a good cause. But at the same time, I've got eyes on me at all times. I do smoke a lot of weed to deal with it all. I'd rather go see a doctor but, no surprise, my job only offers expensive healthcare and I can't afford it with child support being taken. Can't do 2 jobs cause I'm on call yet getting paid shit. Anyways, suicide was never an option really. Occasionally thought about driving off the road but that would endanger others. Good to know I'm not alone in universe."
depression,f0t5f7s,t1_f0t4yjj,1568916227.0,"To be honest, my moods change at the drop of a dime. I can be positive one minute, negative after a blink of the eyes. I can barely make sense of things anymore."
policebrutality,f02wjo6,t3_d3706d,1568339664.0,It's only going to keep getting worse. Law Enforcement are losing their humanity like members trained in the military.
depression,ez8kgb1,t3_cnpdek,1567746446.0,I meant no harm. I apologize for offending you. I'm not good with advice but I try.
depression,ewdiq20,t3_cnpdek,1565301504.0,Try finding one. Even listening to music is a hobby. Try and put your focus on one thing in your spare time.
parkingtickets,ewcqxha,t3_cepwc4,1565289015.0,"No offense, but as a Parking Enforcement Officer myself, if visible signage states not to commit the violation, the officer is not required to say anything. That being said, it's shitty for them to walk right past and not say anything. You can contest the ticket"
depression,ewcq7rz,t1_ewcpbt3,1565288716.0,"I see the predicament. What about your father? Have you expressed this to him? As a parent myself, if my child ever comes to me and tells me they need help, we're going to therapy that day. Mental health is very, very serious to me especially when growing kids and teens are going through all the shit these days. Rather than self harm, try another outlet: heavy metal (I can name a few I listen to), wholesome music....MrPuckett is great on Imgur."
depression,ewcoxvh,t3_cnpbdt,1565288173.0,"I used to cut as a teen. Still have some scars. While it does help you to feel something other than just emotional pain (and is oddly enjoyable), it's not worth the consequences in adult years. Applying for a job with visible scars from obvious cutting doesn't earn points with HR. When I stopped cutting, I resorted to just screaming extremely loud til my throat hurt and voice went out or punching a brick wall. Note: Brick wall will always win. Express your need for help to your mom. If she won't listen or believe, reach out on your own. Through school or online."

depression,ewcis68,t1_ewchxaf,1565285556.0,"Don't thank me. I've been in some pretty hairy situations in my own mind. Most days I know if one person walked up to me and said, ""It's going to be ok"", I'd break down and cry for hours while hugging a complete stranger."
depression,ewcgc3h,t3_cnliph,1565284343.0,"I can't walk up to you, but my friend, you're doing an awesome job! You were able to make this post...that's a start! You reached out to a community about your depression, again, not easy! It's so easy to focus on the big failures and not the small victories. Buddy, if you need anything, I'm here. I can't say I'll always have positive vibes (most of my days are shitty), but I can feel a little better about my day if what I say helps even a little!"
