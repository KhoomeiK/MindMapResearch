There was this meth head lady living under my neighbors’ house that I had run into around town a few times, and one night, while I was asleep where I could open my eyes and see the door, I was awakened by the sound of someone ferociously yanking on a shitty little door. I could see through the window that it was her, and I heard her scratchy voice mumbling something angrily. She went away after like a minute, and I didn’t sleep for a few nights in a row after that. I just laid there on the couch with a boot knife and a maglite and stared at the door."

The cold night air of a cloudless night scrapes at your dry lungs. You are lost, tired, and cold. A pattern of three deep thuds that you passed off as your heartbeat somewhere behind your head has been following for the past few hours. I’m not hearing anything. Folklore is folklore. No one, or nothing, is out here. But when you stop, the thuds continue, and your heart comes out of sync with it.

I multiplied 20 by that number of hours to get minutes, because no fucking shit. The teacher told me I was wrong, and that my number was a little too big. I asked how, naturally. She said since thirds are repeating decimals, I could just multiply the hour number by .333 and assume it to be correct, then multiply by 60 to get minutes. I argued that since a third of an hour is perfectly 20 minutes, we should just do that to get a correct answer. She got mad. I immediately lost seven years off my life."
