I never said there weren't any ethical issues related to bee products. I am a vegan even though I'm not 100% vegan all the time. 

everyone has different motivations for becoming vegan and for me it's my health first and foremost. a quick google search tells you that there are different categories and I'm just a dietary vegan while you're an ethical one. 



as soon as there's a term for ""I don't use animal products other than bee products"" I'd be more than glad to use it, to separate myself from people like you policing me around."
ZeroWasteVegans,fqzeite,t1_fqzdlck,1589765691.0,"oh but you did say ""claiming to be vegan"" but conveniently your comment is gone now.

I suggest you re read the thread yourself because you could have easily avoided this had you accepted the fact that I did admit it wasn't vegan.

ZeroWasteVegans,fqzcnsz,t1_fqyw397,1589764585.0,"why did you delete your comments, huh?

I AM a vegan whether you like it or not and you aren't the vegan police. my issue with you is precisely the fact that you think that you have the moral high ground to decide whether someone's vegan or not. everybody has different morals and I personally don't see an issue with me using bee products, unlike other animals bees aren't tortured and killed they're merely exploited. not only that but I previously mentioned that I am vegan because of my health primarily, not the animals. I am not normalising anything by choosing to use my two beeswax wraps and putting honey in my tea when I'm sick, bee products are already normalised. 

I NEVER SAID BEE PRODUCTS ARE VEGAN!! IN FACT I KNOW THEY AREN'T. I'VE HAD PEOPLE ASK ME IF IT'S VEGAN AND I'VE ALWAYS SAID NO. 




woow kill me for thinking this was just the zero waste sub and suggesting beeswax."

I honestly didn't think twice about what sub I was in, you're the one that got pressed by me mentioning that I use them. I'm not offended but you didn't just say it's not vegan but you pushed your morals onto me, and pretend that you have some sort of moral high ground. fuck off with your ""moral consistency"" and let people live. 

being a keyboard warrior doesn't change anything, it just makes vegans more hated because people like you like to harass others with a different lifestyle."
