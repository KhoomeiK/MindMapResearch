I'm not one of those people who has hundreds of friends but the friends I do have, I miss them sooooo badly. I miss my professors too.  There was this girl I met about 2 weeks into the semester and I got a huge crush on her.  We always walked out of class together and she always wanted to strike up a conversation with me and I felt like we connected.  I don't know if she likes me back but since classes have moved online, I don't know when I'll see her in person again. I was waiting to ask her out because I didn't want to make her uncomfortable.  Now I wish I'd let her know how I feel about her because I don't know when we're going to meet in person again.  I have her phone number but I don't think the best way to let someone know you have a crush on them is by phone.  I've been wanting to send her a text but I don't even know what to say or what to talk about.  I wish she knew how I felt about her. I can totally relate to how you're feeling.

I got the courage up to ask a girl out last year.  We had spent a lot of time hanging out and I liked her and I thought she liked me.  I asked her on a date to see a movie and she said she wanted to see the movie with me but that she just wanted to be friends.  I was honestly ok with that and I agreed to just friends.  And then the day before we were supposed to see the movie, she ghosted me.  I came to find out later through pictures (we followed each other on Instagram) that she was on a date with some other guy on the same day we were supposed to go see the movie. She never told me that she wasn't gonna show up.  That hurt a lot, especially after all the time we'd spent together.

FDR was a border line socialist. Capitalism is what makes this country what it is. The free market keeps people free. Once you take away economic freedom, everything else will crumble. I'm surprised Obama didn't try wealth distribution.

You didn't do anything wrong.  Even though he's hurt now, you saved the boyfriend a ton of grief and heartache later down the road.  Don't feel bad for what you did, you did the right thing.  Also, if someone wants to lecture you about loyalty, where was your daughter's loyalty to her boyfriend? (I know she's your daughter and I'm sorry if that's harsh).  There is not loyalty in the case of cheating, it's a despicable act and in my opinion, if someone knows it's happening and they don't say something, they're just as bad as the cheater.

This comment is so distasteful and disrespectful, it's downright gross to be completely honest. I invited her to my house because I knew she wouldn't be getting home and she was scared, I didn't invite her just to get her in my bed, especially at a time when she's stressed out."
dating_advice,f0uxfp9,t1_f0uwyu2,1568954213.0,Can I go kinda deep with you? I would take a shot and I would not treat her badly if she didnt feel the same way.  But sometime last year I told another girl how I felt about her and I asked her on a date. She told me that she just wanted to hang out just as friends and I said ok and I was fine with it and then she ghosted me.  We just recently started talking again but even still our friendship isn't the same.  And that's why im afraid to tell  this girl how I feel
dating_advice,f0uvmck,t1_f0uu2vx,1568952294.0,"One slight problem with that.  While she's my crush she's also a really good friend. I dont think i've been friend zoned, I'm just afraid I might damage the relationship by asking her out and her not feeling the same"
dating_advice,f0uttkr,t1_f0utnnj,1568950561.0,I dont think she knows.  If she knows it's not because I told her.
dating_advice,f0ute5m,t1_f0ut63f,1568950177.0,I would offer her my bed but my mom already set her up a nice blowup mattress

AskReddit,f0kng6x,t1_f0kna79,1568683328.0,You hit the nail on the head my friend. Good perspective
AskReddit,f0kne02,t1_f0kn9fa,1568683287.0,"Well I can say it isn't true that it's fair to make rich people pay insanely high taxes just because they're rich. I mean they earned their money, why should they have to pay for everyone else's stuff?"
Layer,f0gozs0,t3_d3snp9,1568603499.0,"This is absolutely amazing! You did a great job with this! I miss windows xp days! I remember sitting for hours playing The Sims and The Sims 2.  I haven't played those in years... Sorry, mild nostalgia trip. Great work!"

AmItheAsshole,f0fh4ww,t3_d4ngy8,1568583281.0,NTA. Especially considering that the milkshake is something that can be washed off and in no way hurts the kid. I think this was a very creative way to deal witht the situation on your part. Parents need to make their kids behave. Kudos to you man!
college,f0eq3fr,t3_d4dsns,1568571759.0,I've had the same problem. It would def help if the colleges would handle this issue somehow
AskReddit,ezn11av,t3_d1ezmy,1567999489.0,My girlfriend
AskReddit,ezeclh1,t1_ezec95f,1567862121.0,That's interesting that everyone on here is saying it's easy to use.  Anyone that I've ever talked to said they could never figure out how to use an iphone
AskReddit,eze8prg,t1_eze8em3,1567860644.0,That's interesting that iOS is better for tablets
RoastMe,eza6vey,t3_d09gnm,1567795887.0,I know this is supposed to be roasting but I don't know why your marriage would be arranged.  You're beautiful. I  can't believe someone would have to be forced to marry you
AmItheAsshole,eywvven,t3_cz31bg,1567539088.0,"NTA that's gross to start with.  If they're doing that, they should keep it quiet or do it when you aren't there. I would have done the same thing."
AmItheAsshole,eywv6e4,t3_cz5vk2,1567538639.0,"NTA. It's sad what is happening but you're right. Your half-sister is not the responsibility of you or your mother.  Don't let your dad manipulate you through guilt.  I will offer this one piece of advice, and I don't want to sound like your dad or anything so don't take what I say the wrong way. But just make sure that the absolutely true reason that you don't want to use your mom's money is because you don't feel you are responsible. Be positive that the reason that you don't want to use that money is not because you're still angry at your dad or his mistress. I agree it isn't your responsibility but make sure that's really your reason.  Trust me, I can relate to you because I have my own set of dad issues and hurting someone because you're angry or upset with them doesn't make you feel good. I know from experience, causing someone pain just to get back at them only causes you more pain and it causes regret for your actions. Again, I'm not trying to guilt you like your dad, just please, be sure that the reason you're saying no is not motivated in the least by anger or hurt feelings. And don't let your dad get to you.  Good luck."
college,eyv4mvy,t3_cytzse,1567480523.0,I'm always terrified of that! That's why I quote anything and everything I'm unsure about.  I've even had a couple of profs leave me notes to chill out with so many direct quotes. So yeah I know your fear!
AmItheAsshole,eyupwt9,t1_eyuphey,1567468921.0,It crossed my mind to take the gift with me but I couldn't have lived with myself even though he said what he did.
AmItheAsshole,eysj8kf,t1_eysi6yb,1567400176.0,Thanks
AmItheAsshole,eysj6sp,t1_eyshy4r,1567400125.0,"Yeah I'm thinking I'm just gonna let this one fade, I just feel bad about it. He's probably acting distant for a reason and I just wish he'd let me help him.  I've tried getting through to him but if there's a specific reason he's become so distant, he won't tell me what it is. It's starting to cause more stress than anything else though."
AmItheAsshole,eysiqrx,t1_eysiiax,1567399639.0,I'm sorry to hear that about your friend. It sucks when it turns out someone isn't who they seemed that they were.
AmItheAsshole,eysihcw,t1_eyshw7i,1567399373.0,I thought about taking the present with me but I knew I wouldn't have been able to live with myself for doing that even though he said what he did.
AmItheAsshole,eysidu0,t1_eyshy1x,1567399273.0,Aww thanks!
