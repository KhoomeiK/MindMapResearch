collapse,fctwo3v,t1_fcsuofe,1577963354.0,"Ok here's an analogy. There are eight people in a strawberry field. Each individual could get around with one bucket of strawberries. But that's not what's happening. Three people relentlessly pick up as many strawberries as they can. Then, they take four of the five strawberry buckets, leaving only one for the remaining five people. 

Then, while stuffing their faces with strawberries, they notice that it seems like at this rate, they might run out of strawberries and might not be able to get as much as they presently do. Plus, it seems like one bucket for five people doesn't leave much strawberries at all for them. 

Their conclusion: it's overpopulation! It has to be! There are too many people! Those five people must disappear! 

There is no clear cut off as to how many people is too many. With current energy consumption and production levels, the Earth can certainly not sustain eight billion people. But with a paradigm of energy conservation, it might be possible to sustain over ten billion human beings. The better part of our ecological footprint comes from some two and a half billion people, 75% of greenhouse gas emissions comes from as few as a hundred multinational corporations that overproduce to the point where millions of tons of ressources are simply wasted every year. 

Even if you culled the bottom four billion of the current seven billion people living on this planet, little would change, because their ecological footprint is negligible in comparison. They produce little, they consume little. 

Stop wasting, drastically cut in the production and consumption of energy of the upper two and a half billion people and you'll probably be able to sustain eight billion people. But in order for that to be possible, you'll have to accept being poorer."
