One thing I will say though is to be wary of having so much on your plate that you feel paralyzed and don't know where to start, and therefore don't do anything.  Making lists and keeping them organized can help but avoid letting your tasks pile up by attacking them as soon as you know about them."

I found the headset on staples' website for $29.99 with a warranty. When mine broke I asked the office manager if we had a warranty and we did not. Management also had access to our lockers. There were a few people who complained of things being stolen out of them.

relationship_advice,fd7azq7,t3_ek1bkg,1578201767.0,"My mom gets angry easily too, and even though I've moved out too I still panic whenever *anyone* calls my name. 

I think it's something that really takes time to heal, time away from your mother to grow confidence and strength by yourself. You can choose to still see her or to stop seeing her, but if she is the main source of your stress it may be best to avoid seeing her often until you can safely tell her the way she makes you feel. I know telling her this will probably make her worry or maybe even upset, but if you aren't honest with her then she will never know or be aware of how what she's doing is affecting you. Try to find a couple friends, a club, hobby, or job to meet people who can give you the sense of having normal relationships with others and try to build your confidence that way.

I hope this helps. I have a similar relationship with my mother and my mood is very dependent on how she is feeling to the point that if she's mad at me then I feel bad about myself and question my abilities. Build a boundary for yourself and don't let your mom step over it. Let her know how you feel nicely and let her know you care about her, but that the way she is acting is also hurting you. Therapy also may be helpful in this situation if that is an option for you."

At least with a journal you can write or type your feelings out instead of venting it all to someone else. Maybe that's just something bad that I do, but i am trying to avoid it through journaling."

Enjoy and take advantage of your parents allowing you to stay with them, but make sure to let them know you appreciate it by either paying rent, helping around the house and/or showing them respect and appreciation. I'm not sure what your family relationships are like, but you really learn to understand your parents once you begin adulting on your own. 

Try to do well in school while you can. Take advantage of the free knowledge and structure being given to you now if you attend a public high school. Failing at something doesn't mean you shouldn't do something or stop pursuing something. And please remember that moving forward doesn't necessarily mean keeping up with other people, but focusing on your own progress and how you can change to make yourself better. 

That being said, I highly recommend filing for FAFSA and attending a community college before going to a university (if you plan on going to college and don't know what career you want yet). It has saved me a lot of money. Education is marketed as a product that will change your life, and it can if you have an end goal and a plan to get there. I know a few people who went straight to university after high school and dropped out because it was not for them at that time, or they failed and lost confidence. If you have a goal, create a list or map of the things you need to do to get there. It will help make the journey easier, and this concept works for many things such as doing projects. Learning how you learn best is important, and it is different for everyone.

I guess if you get anything from my comment, enjoy the last couple years of being a teen while you can and have good fun. Take care of your body and it will take care of you. Enjoy the people around you and try not to think about what others think of you as much. If you like being alone, walk/hike, read, write, or treat yourself to dinner at your favorite restaurants: find a hobby or job. Learn how to work smart and hard, but choose to work smart. Learn to be comfortable with yourself and do things that interest you. One thing I regret is spending so much time online and not being present enough to really appreciate the people around me while they were there. Make time to spend time with people you care about. 

Also, learning to use a calendar and to-do list is very useful - and the act of checking tasks off is very satisfying. I recommend google calendar because it is easy on the eyes and easy to use in my opinion.

These are things I would tell my 18 year old self, and I hope they may help you. Take it easy."
