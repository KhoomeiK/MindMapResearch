AskWomen,fqh49oe,t3_gil16z,1589367295.0,"Yup. I was an administrative assistant. I was a contractual employee. Our boss was almost always gone/missing in action. I didn't have a lunch break, which was okay since I could wiggle 15-30 minute breaks. I was expected to spend my own money to get things done for the office and to prove that I deserved reimbursement for those expenses, and I was also expected to work overtime (even though they never said it to my face). I got fed up with how poor the management, the office location and environment was, so I quit."

AskReddit,fpcks2n,t1_fpb4bcf,1588504247.0,THIS. It took me 9 years to complete my bachelors (bonus is that i got an associate degree along the way!). It is PERFECTLY OK to do things on your own pace and time. As long as you complete your goal.
mentalhealth,fpcj85h,t3_gcdan4,1588502573.0,"I know the feeling. I do the same thing. I wish I could tell you it gets better, but that doesn't apply for everyone (and it's not that easy). At most, I can tell you that I am proud of you for acknowledging a behavior you no longer want to do and that it is in your head that you want to stop doing so. That's a big step. Please be kinder to yourself. Cheers"

depression,f6p2llg,t3_ds57wd,1573045470.0,"I feel the same. I only got diagnosed recently but I've had depression for 15 years (I'm 26, so personality development ? idk what that is). I think it's great that you're voicing this out... you're not alone. And the first step to recovery (for me) is admitting something isn't right.."

AskWomen,eriw9du,t3_c2430l,1560908945.0,"Yup. It was a long-distance relationship that probably was destined to fail (due to my mental health and the distance). Iâ€™m glad I met him and Iâ€™m glad we loved each other for a while, but Iâ€™ve moved on and so has he. He will always have a special place in my heart, but I wonâ€™t try to reconnect even if I had the chance."

Thank you for your comment :)"
askwomenadvice,erfs3km,t1_erfhfv4,1560816424.0,"This. I learned this the hard way.
Itâ€™s always a good idea to eat before going grocery shopping (or shopping in general) to avoid (or reduce) impulse purchases. Iâ€™ve learned that when I feel full or not hungry, I tend to stick to the shopping list rather than adding (more) snacks to my cart. +1 on stocking up on nuts and fruit."
