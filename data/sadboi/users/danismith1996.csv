UCSantaBarbara,fqvjq9j,t3_gl47q6,1589678752.0,"I’ve had two sessions with my therapist since CAPS went online, both were really helpful. She let me choose between talking over the phone or zoom and I felt like a phone call would be more natural so that’s what we did. For privacy, I wore headphones and closed my bedroom door. Obviously it’s not the same as seeing the therapist in person, but I was still really thankful to have that hour to talk with her and felt like she understood me even through the phone. You can always try it for the first session, and if you don’t feel comfortable you don’t have to schedule another one :)"

UCSantaBarbara,fqf7ioo,t3_gigok9,1589320016.0,I took 101A in the winter and definitely recommend waiting to take it then with Low or whatever teacher will replace him. A good majority of my class were people who originally took it in the fall with Thrower and dropped. It's also not an 8 am in the winter like it is in the fall which was enough of a reason for me to wait for winter.

UCSantaBarbara,fpmdrmr,t3_gduy3m,1588730863.0,"it’s completely understandable for you to feel so overwhelmed with everything you have going on :/ idk if you considered it yet, but maybe make an appointment to speak with a counselor at CAPS. I know it would be one less hour of the day to do work for school/be with your brother, etc. but taking that time for yourself is really helpful if your spending so much energy helping everyone around you. I started seeing a therapist from CAPS during fall quarter because I was so overwhelmed with school and can’t imagine getting through this quarter without talking to her every other week! 

If you want that additional support (which you 100% deserve) but want something less formal, you can also get in touch with crisis textline by texting HELLO to 741741. It’s a free crisis hotline that’s available via text message 24/7 :)"

UCSantaBarbara,fphvfrk,t3_gd1zoc,1588628534.0,"I would 100% recommend taking it at CC if you can. I transferred as a bio major this past year and took ochem at my CC the summer before I transferred because the bio advisors told me that taking ochem at UCSB after transferring basically guarantees that I will need to take an extra year to finish upper division bio classes. The only pre-req I wasn't able to finish before transferring is physics and while it's hard at UCSB, I can only imagine how much worse taking ochem here would be."

UCSantaBarbara,foo1g1y,t1_fomkymf,1587930622.0,"I personally don’t feel like the class is a lot of work because you don’t really need to do the reading to do the reading quiz (almost all the questions are on quizlet). I watch the lectures on 2x speed and take notes and then do the comprehension check which usually doesn’t take me more than 10-15 minutes. I can’t say much about the midterm and final because we haven’t taken them yet and the papers don’t seem too bad given how much time we have to do them. If you need help with anything feel free to pm me, I’m happy to help :)"

CNCSP 101 is one of the required classes for the minor and I thought it was really easy and most of the information was common sense. CNCSP 114 is psych of gender and really interesting so far. We had a lot of work in the beginning but after communicating with the TA’s and the professor, the work was cut down by a lot. Overall very happy with my experience in the minor so far :)"

That way if school does end up being online and you want to go back home, you (hopefully) won’t be stuck paying rent. Those of us who moved out for spring quarter got a full refund and I’m assuming they will do the same for fall quarter."

UCSantaBarbara,fo8vhbr,t3_g58cz4,1587604692.0,"When I was deciding between 108 series and 110, I talked with the bio advisors and they basically said that the 108 series is for ppl who want to go into research and 110 is for those who want to go to med school/PA school/ etc. I ended up taking 110 this past winter quarter and the topics perfectly aligned with the biochem section of the MCAT. So if your goal is med school, there’s no need to take 3 quarters of biochem when you can get all the info you need in one quarter."
UCSantaBarbara,fo89sdt,t1_fo7cs7t,1587592494.0,"This is my first year as a transfer and I had a very different experience so far. Yeah the first quarter was rough adjusting to classes and stuff but I’ve also had an amazing time. I think any school you transfer to will be a rough transition at first but once you get through that, there are so many good opportunities waiting for you. I’ve met some of my best friends in my classes and can’t wait to hopefully go back for summer session B. I lived in the transfer apartments, met so many transfers in my classes, and everyone I’ve talked so far loves the school. I’m sorry you are not having a good time, but I really don’t think that’s reflective of everyone else’s experience."

The beautiful campus, laid back but academically strong environment, and how nice everyone is are just the top reasons why. I’m a biology major and I’ve had no problems getting into my upper div classes, but I know it’s not the same for the lower division classes (this will probably be a problem at every UC). There are so many amazing programs and clubs to be involved in and the people (at least the ones I have met so far) have all been kind and willing to help. I’ve taken 3 upper division bio classes so far and I have not experienced the “cut through pre med” environment at all. It’s been the opposite actually, everyone wants to study together and will happily help you if you ask. If you have any specific questions feel free to pm me! Good luck with your decision <3"

There are plenty of research opportunities and the advisors have been helpful as well. I’m not familiar with UCSD’s program but I haven’t really noticed a competitive atmosphere in my classes this quarter, everyone is nice and more than willing to help you if you ask.

UCSantaBarbara,f5vyltw,t3_dogsa9,1572506639.0,"Hi! I was in your place last year. UCLA was always my dream school, especially after spending two years at community college. I got into UCLA but I ended up choosing UCSB and couldn't be happier with my decision. It's given me the opportunity to move out of the house and experience the social aspect of college that I feel like I definitely wouldn't have gotten at UCLA since I live close by and would have commuted there rather than living on campus. I talked with a lot of people who go to UCLA before making my decision and most of them said that beyond the prestige of the name, UCLA doesn't have much to offer over other UC's. I'm also pre med and in my short 5 weeks here, I have already found plenty of opportunities (pre med frats/sororities, clubs, events, etc.) to get the necessary experience for med school. At the end of the day, I think you should pick the school that you will be happiest at. And I definitely agree with everyone else in that you should apply to more UC's, even if they aren't your top-choices. Good luck!!"
