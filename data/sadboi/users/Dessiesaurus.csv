They can play with both ""boy toys and girl toys"", the same with how they dress, but what I think is more important is that they have a choice in what they want to do, even if that means following gender norms. In the early years I would probably be more gender neutral since I know how some people will react if a boy would look 'girly'. So no skirts or dresses until they can chose themselves, probably short hair. I wouldn't want my children to feel ashamed.

I've heard parents say ""he/she is a boy/girl, they can't play/wear/do that!"" Which is insane. Me and my siblings were never told that something is for just boys or girls, and although we are all cis, we're not that influenced by gender roles except for how we dress.

The only thing I would suggest is to outgrow the bangs, and show your face more, it's beautiful. The bangs are not bad, your face is just really pretty.

But for this group: The only thing is that you need to make sure they do something. I would divide the work and make a thorough plan, if they don't follow it, that's their fault.

I hate that mentality of ""I'm not like other girls"", so I try to compensate by being more feminine because women are awesome and I want people to know that. My personality is rather masculine but I think it's due to the women in my family having big voices and respect. 

M/F traits have nothing to do with gender, but still, a lot of people get angry when they get told that they are feminine, which is so wrong. I live in a feminine country, yet it's still looked as being 'weak'. It annoys me so much that I feel the need to be more feminine to prove 'them' wrong. I'm in a personal conundrum if I want to be more feminine or not, because I don't really care that much yet I want to be a good role model to girls.
