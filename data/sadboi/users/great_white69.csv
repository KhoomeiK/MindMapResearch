mentalhealth,f3kr7o0,t3_dh3l64,1570968762.0,I'm not sure your an alcoholic your just a young dude that's struggling. What's happening next week that you could form a new friend circle? A clean slate can be an exciting thing. You have a long life in front of you give yourself a break and perhaps admit that this will take time but you'll get there
mentalhealth,f3kpy6b,t3_dh4sgj,1570968320.0,I don't think you did anything wrong. Underage drinking Shame on the cops that did that to you. I'm a lot older than you and drink booze we all do. Give yourself time and give yourself a break. The fact that you feel so bad means your a good person. But your young mate and processing feelings is hard. Maybe try and understand why you fell out with your best mate and if you can patch it up that will help.
mentalhealth,f3kn33n,t3_dh6hd0,1570967454.0,Sorry to hear this and I'm not suprised you feel exhausted after. No it's not normal to feel such intense emotion. Try and understand where this is coming from what's making you unhappy?
mentalhealth,f3kl5az,t3_dh748u,1570966882.0,I think it probably was a panic attack caused by the fact that you probably fancied the woman involved in both situations. Was the waitress hot? Was the woman you were serving wine too hot? Try and relax dude I bet they had a sexual thought about you too. Every human male ot female sizes up everyone they meet
mentalhealth,f3kk59e,t3_dh3edd,1570966601.0,This is not normal and I think you know it. You give reasons to why you have no friends but it sounds like excuses. Also as you are asking the question I think you know the answer yourself mate.
mentalhealth,f3kjj9w,t3_dh6kbp,1570966353.0,What you have gone through sounds terrible and I'm sorry about that. It maybe sounds like your brain is trying to get comfort in anyway it can. Hearing other people's struggles is giving you comfort that others go through similar shit. However you are so down on yourself that you miss interpret it and feel bad.
mentalhealth,f3kgi3p,t3_dh5g3s,1570965377.0,What things are you good at? Those are talents you have and congrats. Think back and you probably have put a ton off work into those talents. No one and I mean no one is just good at everything. Skills take time and effort. the most important thing in life is too actually realise this. No one is just good at.. eg drawing they practise and get better.
mentalhealth,f3keumv,t3_dh28af,1570964925.0,Was he just stonned? I think there's a lot of things going on here. Perhaps you have to put yourself in your mates position. Maybe he had just smoked and was feeling paranoid and fucked up himself? Maybe he knew how much importance you put on him coming round and felt insecure. Dude you're reaction of punching things and hurting yourself is... Not good  I get it. I totally do but it's not good and your friends will know this as well. Please try and be calm. I know that's easy to say but try and put yourself in your friends position. The other side is he is just a dick and you need to concentrate on other friends. Be calm bro x
