getdisciplined,f1ut1p8,t3_daue5h,1569763267.0,Totally doable. I had some pretty far fetched goals summer of junior year. Senior year I was an entirely different student. I ended up getting into all the schools I applied to. Did that again when I changed majors and applied to a top school three times before getting in. It’s really about dedication and discipline. Set your goals and focus on what you can do right now to get you closer to that even bigger goal. Be the person you want to be now. Study harder than you’ve ever studied before. Get close to your teachers and other mentors that motivate you. Not only writing down your goals but posting them on a wall in your room so you’re reminded everyday of what you want to accomplish.

The dosage they give is based on if it’s at a effective level in your blood. I don’t think how much fluids you drink affect your levels negatively but I’d ask your pdoc to confirm. I do suggest to stay hydrated because of potential lithium poisoning if you don’t drink enough fluids.
