ireland,fok1t9v,t1_fojzzg5,1587833796.0,"I‚Äôve heard of one other group creating a online memory portal, which you can make videos from. Not sure if they are planning to monetise it.

Monetising (charging) is never something I want to do. It‚Äôs not a time for gouging for money. This is just a simple gesture to help people in need. Some have asked about paying for it, and instead I have suggested a donation to Aware, but that it is absolutely not necessary."

AnorexiaRecovery,f7ic92p,t3_dwc38q,1573757026.0,"I am a man in treatment working towards recovery. My Anorexia developed alongside Orthorexia; for me they are aligned and not exclusive. I've a long way to go in my progress, but I work hard on it every day.

The only thing I would say, speaking personally, is that I've found male anorexia is stereotyped as affecting teen boys and gay men. I'm a straight man in my 30's and I only began to live with the conditions in recent times. When I initially looked for information, the majority of what I found was written by or directed towards those demographics."
AnorexiaRecovery,f3kuc5v,t1_f3aq46h,1570969695.0,Thank you very much

AnorexiaRecovery,f3ajl3z,t1_f37synx,1570776121.0,"The one on the left represents me as I have been and am now. The design represents four elements. It shows my black and white thinking - across the brain, the eyes, and the mouth. The bars are designed to be sharp and rigid, with no flexibility. It also portrays how I feel locked in by my eating disorder, my social anxiety, my OCD, and deeper issues. The black and white bars are like a prison cell. It also represents a burglar (the McDonalds Hamburglar to be specific - Google him) who has robbed me of my enjoyment of indulgent food. He is my eating disorder. The splashes and dots of different colours in the white bars represent my true identity trying to break through these things. They are random and connected by a manic network of splashes and lines - something which has caused me a lot of confusion and distress.

The one on the right represents who I believe I really am and want to be. The design is much more fluid, with no linear and rigid lines. The colours represent the elements of my true personality being allowed to reveal themselves. They flow together in a dynamic way. There is black and white included as I don't think I'll ever rid myself completely of that type of thinking and I don't it would be healthy to. The colours are specifically chosen to represent specific things and are used in certain parts of the face.

- Yellow: a welcoming face (from the mouth)
- Red: a loving partner, son, and brother (through the eye)
- Blue: a self-caring soul (right from my bones)
- Orange: an enthusiastic participant (in my brain)
- Green: a trusted friend (supporting my face)

I hope that makes sense."

AnorexiaNervosa,f0lp8ds,t1_f0kqz2w,1568725869.0,"That's exactly it. In starvation (restriction) your brain reverts to the 'cave man' brain state, sub-conciously believing it is in the middle of a famine. It encourages food hoarding to ensure it has food when needed.

I did (and sometimes still do) hoard a huge amount of food, and ironically it all went off and was all wasted. The brain works in mysterious ways."
Dublin,f0llyno,t3_d5eir8,1568722972.0,Nice capture. Modern day Trojan horses.
EDAnonymous,f0llv4p,t3_d5et6o,1568722879.0,"I have a huge amount of guilt for what I have put my partner through during the height of ED illness and behaviours.

But I have been able to talk to her about this, and on each occasion she has been truthful saying it has been difficult for her, however she knows it's not something I had planned or did purposely. She always comes back to the fact that I got 'sick' in my mind and body. I have to trust her belief in that, otherwise I would go crazy."
EDAnonymous,f0irsau,t3_d50p3j,1568646017.0,"I was you 7 weeks ago. Scared shitless because I had given in and was voluntarily going into residential treatment, while under huge distress. 7 weeks on I'm still here, and now accept it was the only and best solution. I'm doing well, even after hitting many bumps along the way. If you open yourself up, you will find a new you.

Don't be scared. Don't be frightened. We are with you in spirit. You will benefit from it more than you can see right now. It's time to be self-carish (my word to replace selfish)."

AnorexiaNervosa,ev8trr6,t3_cipenm,1564291245.0,All I can say to this is that it is like reading an exact post I would‚Äôve written. I‚Äôm dealing with the exact same thoughts. If you find the answer I would love to know.
EatingDisorders,ev8tknw,t3_cioxp7,1564291033.0,"I love cooking. I always have, although as my ED (anorexia - calorie counting, restriction) developed, it has became a bit more obsessive than enjoyable. I get a sense of achievement out out of creating tasty food, although I cannot venture to adding anything to recipes and dishes that is outside my ‚Äòsafe‚Äô range. I‚Äôm only starting into early stage recovery right now though, so maybe that may change, but I find it hard and very scary to believe.

Up until recently I always cooked on my own, and found it very hard to let my partner or anyone into the kitchen while I was there. I‚Äôm trying to make cooking a bit more collaborative now, but more often than not it ends up in tears when I feel like I‚Äôve lost control of the situation. Like yesterday my mother started chopping spring onion as she didn‚Äôt hear me say I would do it, and that ended up in me having an anxiety/panic attack and running out of kitchen."
AnorexiaRecovery,eufid1y,t1_eudw2g9,1563775588.0,Thanks for that. Hopefully the therapist support isn‚Äôt too far off and I‚Äôll be able to work well with them. Appreciate your reply.
