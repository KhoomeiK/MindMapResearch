If it doesn’t happen then it doesn’t happen and I know I can have a full and enriching life without a partner. However, something I recently talked to a therapist about is my attachment style. I tend to have avoidant attachment tendencies where I make super strict boundaries and caveats that make it kind of difficult to date. You can take a quiz online and it might help you learn something about yourself."

We’d compete in rocket engineering competitions and the project groups were largely left to their own devices with not a lot of professor interference. Every other school would enter using generic names like Spectrum or Horizon or some shit like that. Our school entered Rocket McRocketface and Kim Jong Boom.

In the grand scheme of things it won’t matter so don’t kill yourself trying to make it happen. Your sanity and mental health is more important.
