SuicideWatch,fpx1hqn,t3_gfsv5a,1588973884.0,I think what makes a difference is that the therapy can work more effectively if the patient is open and receptive. So someone going to seek help is already in a different mind set then someone who might feel so helpless and doesn't get to reach out idk

It is completely valid! Often times people who hurt or abuse are ones close to us. 

You were not old enough to understand let alone give consent and there was a power imbalance between you and your older sister so it makes sense if you were ever frightened or kept quiet 

It's good to get things off your chest! 

Do you have a therapist you can talk to, that can help"

That's amazing that despite everything you've been through, (and yes I believe you 100%, idk how anyone couldn't) you're still able to find it in yourself to help people like your grandmother  


I just wanted to say that I hope going regularly to a therapist, or a psychologist, or at least someone who is trained in this and is an expert can help  


That's gotta be the worst feeling, when you're telling the truth and no one believes you, it must feel so ostracizing and alienating. I just wish that people who are closest to each other, like family members didn't do these heinous things, you'd think that family of all people are supposed to be there to trust you and protect you and believe you no matter what  


I wonder if writing about this more often, maybe even just to yourself in a journal might help, to see how you view things at certain times or just your headspace at certain times  


I hope it gets better, I truly do, and i'm glad that you have a friend!"

rapecounseling,fjee0n1,t3_fd0a8d,1583270148.0,It's understandable that you felt uncomfortable about it at the time and subsequently look back at it and it still bugs you.

And even monogamous relationships are just serially monogamous so that just means one at a time. 

The least common type is polyandry so one woman, mutiple men, specifically fraternal polyandry so the two men are brothers, usually in a poor area where one man isn't enough of a financial support to raise a family so you need more. 

Some primates are monogamous, we are not"
