Unfortunately, if they do the same thing they did in 2009, payments will only go out to those that have filed a tax return in the past 12-months.  For those of us on SS who don't even make enough to file taxes, we're probably going to be left with what we already earn.  The crazy part, I don't even make $1000 per month on SS.  It would be nice if they closed that gap to $1000.  Frankly, that would mean $300 extra in my pocket each month."
Columbus,fksx9ck,t3_fkig8h,1584500568.0,"I used to live right across the road from Studio 35.  As a disabled individual, it was the best thing to have within walking distance.  I loved being the only person at their 4pm matinees.  Being able to get up and walk around when I started hurting without having to miss any of the movie...simply the best.  And my old roommate was their bar's Norm."

Hopefully I'll get the chance to catch you when you're next in town.  And while I have your attention, could you possibly answer a question for me?  If you were being forced to pick a side in a gang fight between clowns and mimes, which side would you choose?"

Nevermind the fact that your math is way off so far as the price is concerned, they're price gouging during a national emergency.  As someone who lives off of SSI, every penny counts.  You make your choices, and I'll make mine.  Use the information given, or don't.  But as consumers, how and where we choose to spend our money is our power."

I don't have enough money to be nickled and dimed away like that, as I assume that their greed has raised the price on everything in the store too."

Ohio,fk8mal4,t1_fk6zit2,1583958751.0,"I assumed as much.  The article I was reading made it sound as though it wouldn't take much time to get it all sorted out.  As containment of the virus is shifting from federal to state hands, I assume we'll begin to see many changes that will be unprecedented in recent history.  The quarantine plan that originated in China and is now being used in Italy may seem severe, but it is working.  We cannot continue to go about our lives not thinking about everyone else at this point.  I was glad to see that the federal government is atleast working to revive a 20-year old bill which is meant to protect workers from scenarios just like this and provide 14-days of financial relief should a worker not be able to go to work.  Unfortunately the CDC has made it clear that we're looking at a period of months rather than weeks that this epidemic will be making its rounds.  

Stay safe, stay healthy."

It was funny to watch Bashir and Esre talk about going to the holosuite to fight the Battle of Thermopylae and that battle be the very next thing being shown on the station.  It felt like a subtle joke that few probably picked up on.
