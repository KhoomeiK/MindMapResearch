depression,fh2gukk,t3_exo6f1,1581252126.0,"Tonight is a better night than a lot of nights. I got invited to a party, which usually means I end up mixing drinks for people and generally ensuring that everyone has a good time by bringing alcohol or weed, introducing people and keeping conversations going, getting stuff going even if I'm not that interested in games, or just checking in with people to see if they're doing okay. We joke that I just become the mom of the group when I'm drunk by making sure everyone is having a good time but honestly, I feel like no one really cares about me. I'm depressed and suicidal a lot. I wonder why I bother when, even if I know parties would legitimately not be as good without my help or hosting, I always end up feeling like an outcast by way of how everyone having fun doesn't necessarily mean that I feel happy. I don't just push alcohol and games at friends. I cut people off since I sometimes know their limits better than they do and I usually try to be sober by the end of the night to either see people off or drive stragglers home or let them stay over. I legitimately care about everyone and make sure everyone is safe and taken care of. Why do I feel so empty. I miss when I could have someone next to me helping me. I miss feeling like someone saw me and understood and appreciated me. Sometimes I get the feeling like it doesn't matter if I end up killing myself because no matter how much I care for legitimately everyone around me, not just in parties but in general, all I'll ever be seen as is someone who was nice. Not a boyfriend or girlfriend. Not someone's best friend. I wonder how often people really think about me at all. I'm just the person that poured drinks and ran around looking stupid worrying about people who can't even remember to use my fucking pronouns. Why do I care. Why does my happiness feel so fleeting and empty. Does everyone feel this way? I'm so alone and helpless. All I'm doing is flailing around trying to get anyone to stay around before I lose my grip."

I just want to feel comforted honestly but it doesn't seem like anyone else really gets it. I'm usually the one doing the comforting with relationships and friendships and honestly I'm very sad that no one really notices that I try so hard. I wish someone would see me. I don't feel entitled to it, but it would just feel nice. Here's to a new school year, hopefully my senior year of college goes well. I just don't want to feel so alone anymore, I want acceptance that doesn't really seem to exist for me."

I really wish things were different for me. Not easier, just different so it felt easier than this. I don't like drudging through my day pretending I'm not contemplating why I keep myself looking happy for other people. Everyone is a flake. Everyone keeps me around until I stop amusing them or until they get bored. I'm very tired of being people's wind up toy. Where are the friends I have when I'm not the one who's granting immediate support. Why do I have a phone if none of the contacts ever talk to me unless I go out of my way to reach out first. Sleep isn't helping much and I want to go back to school. One more year."

Between that and home stuff I can't wait to go back to college. I miss being able to walk like five feet before seeing a friend and just hanging out at their dorm. The friends I have at home kinda suck when it comes to plans, everyone I've tried making plans with has flaked at least twice. I get when people are busy but it hurts when it's literally everyone you know. I wish other people tried reaching out for once. Why am I supposed to pretend to be the extrovert for everyone else?

I miss having friends."
