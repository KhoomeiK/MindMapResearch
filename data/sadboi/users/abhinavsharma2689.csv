BPDlovedones,fkj4bid,t3_fiq7m0,1584235862.0,"I see unconditional love as being separate from being in a relationship. Unconditionally loving, by definition would and could require not being in a relationship with the person you love, I feel not being the FP or not being close to the pwBPD enhances the chances of better living for this person, and for myself. Then why would I force or work in the direction of being with the object of my affection, that's not loving is it."
