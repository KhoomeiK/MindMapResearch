CleanLivingKings,fqjjejs,t3_gj3gv7,1589410789.0,"As other have said, Christ and the mercy that he offers through his Church is the only way you will ever truly be free of the guilt you feel. Because you are right ‚Äî you did do something terrible. And any attempt to just bury that guilt without actually dealing with it is going to be fruitless. 

‚ÄúNot until a person has become so wretched that in the strictest sense it is true of him that his only wish, his only consolation, is to die‚Äînot until then does Christianity begin...‚Äù -S. Kierkegaard 

Christianity provides the way out of this. When you feel ‚ÄúI deserve to die for this‚Äù - the Church holds up the crucifix and says ‚Äúbehold, the God man dying in your place, dying that death you feel you must die, destroying that old part of you and raising you to something new.‚Äù


Particularly Sacramental confession with an ordained priest will cleanse your soul of the stain of this sin and will be a resurrection for you. There is immense healing in the sacrament of confession. The priest holds the power of the keys‚Äî the power of Christ given to the Church to forgive sins. 

Not only does it have metaphysical benefits for the health of your soul but also great psychological benefit as well. God is kind like that. I assure you that hearing the words of absolution pronounced over you will heal much of the guilt you feel. I can‚Äôt remember the saint, but someone said that in the confessional the penitent ‚Äúvomits his sins before the priest.‚Äù I can‚Äôt think of a better way to describe it. Just like when your stomach is sick, when you can finally throw up, though the actual act may feel unpleasant, immediately after you feel immense relief. 

Of course, if you are not yet a member of the Church then go and be baptized and repent of your sins for the foreignness of all your sins and to be washed in the water that flowed from the side of Christ as an infinite fountain of mercy and to be made a member of his mystical body. It‚Äôs all real, promise."

I think that this is because the enneagram always takes things ‚Äútoo close‚Äù‚Äî whatever the thing is that is your core issue (be it fear/anxiety for head types, anger/rage for body types, or shame/sadness/neediness for heart types) will always feel like it‚Äôs too much to face the fullness of‚Äî if you‚Äôre a head type you would much rather work on your sadness or your anger than fully feel and face all your fear, etc. 

When I first really discovered I was a 5 (through several resources, but ultimately reading the thick descriptions in Riso and Hudson and Naranjo‚Äôs ‚ÄúCharacter and Neurosis‚Äù) it broke me down for like a week.

The enneagram shows you it‚Äôs not automatic, that it‚Äôs just the fixation doing its thing. And that‚Äôs pretty shocking. 

As Fr. Rohr says, if you say ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs so wonderful that I‚Äôm a 5!‚Äù Or any number, then you are either not really that number, or you haven‚Äôt yet understood the enneagram and how all of the types are traps (and the ultimate goal of the enneagram is to show you that you are NOT your type, the type is where your ego is fixated, and that your true self is waiting beyond the type)."

All the bullshit with tritypes or ‚Äúfixes‚Äù that are across the circle in different triads is really just an attempt, IMHO, to avoid the closer look that the enneagram forces you to take at yourself. 

If you can say ‚Äúwell, I‚Äôm a 5 but I have a little 3 and a little 9 as well‚Äù then that let‚Äôs you avoid truly facing just how devastating it is for your ego to admit that yes, you are a 5 and yes you get stuck in those horrible places.

SEO,f0x8eqm,t1_f0wd3l2,1569024800.0,This is the right answer.

TherapeuticKetamine,f0pby3s,t1_f0oz844,1568831528.0,Thank you! This is helpful.
TherapeuticKetamine,f0pbwmw,t1_f0oz45n,1568831505.0,"This is really helpful, thank you! And will do."
TherapeuticKetamine,f0oxgyn,t3_d5znx3,1568822471.0,I‚Äôm having my first infusion tonight and I‚Äôm feeling pretty nervous! Do you try to guide your mind towards specific issues you want to process (is that even posssible?) or do you just go along for the ride?
TherapeuticKetamine,f0mj7lr,t3_d561va,1568746213.0,"Thank you so much for sharing your experience. This sounds amazing and I am so happy for you! I am having my first infusion tomorrow and I'm pretty nervous about it ‚ÄîI tend to react very strongly to medications / even weed can send me on some full-blown psychedelic trips, even to the point of ego death once. So I am a little anxious about how ""powerful"" the ketamine experience will be, but I am also really, really looking forward to it."
TherapeuticKetamine,f0j2b8g,t3_d45c4c,1568650200.0,Thanks so much for sharing this! I‚Äôve struggled with bipolar disorder for over 10 years and I‚Äôm researching ketamine right now and really feeling hopeful about and you‚Äôre story is so helpful. Now I just need to figure out how to afford it.
depression,f0a7rwk,t1_f0a1ti9,1568511586.0,"Lolz too real. I just found this post while doing exactly what OP is talking about. OP, if you find a cure, let us know. r/getdisciplined is often cheesy but there are a few nuggets of gold in there"
depression,f09zjfs,t1_f09xkv8,1568508886.0,"Sorry if my reply doesn‚Äôt make much sense, having a pretty rough night myself tonight"
depression,f09zby8,t1_f09xkv8,1568508813.0,"I just looked through your post history and you have a great sense of humor and seem to have eclectic and interesting taste. You seem like way more of an interesting person than 90% of the people I work with. 

If you‚Äôre anything like me, in reality you are probably way more likable than you give yourself credit for (this is what I‚Äôve been told about myself‚Äîstill don‚Äôt believe it, but I‚Äôm trying) and then your self-doubt and self-hatred causes you to self sabotage sometimes. Idk if that‚Äôs the case for you but it definitely is for me. Hang in there buddy, it will get better. Like other people said, maybe try a meet up or even try visiting a church? Probably not a popular opinion around here.. ha! But I am a Catholic, and I know if it wasn‚Äôt for God‚Äôs supernatural intervention and love for me, I would be dead a long time ago. Not trying to preach, sorry, just wanted to say that. Really sorry if that offends"
depression,f09sfiu,t3_d4cim2,1568506328.0,"Hey, I‚Äôm really shitty at making friends too (like, really shitty). After college all my friends moved away and I‚Äôve had basically no friends for the last few years. It really sucks. And I feel you on tearing up. I‚Äôm glad your alive too, for what it‚Äôs worth. Longing for human connection like that shows you have a good soul. Hang in there, friend."

uglyduckling,f02z0z4,t3_ck583e,1568341054.0,If this isn‚Äôt the top post of all time for this sub in 6 months then this sub is cancelled.
leaves,f00zd87,t3_d37vdh,1568308535.0,"Like someone else said, this post isn‚Äôt pointless at all and the fact that you have cultivated the ability to see that urge, pause, and observe it is huge! Stay strong. We are all with you."
conspiracy,ezv4nvo,t3_cv41yf,1568167082.0,Sounds like temporary weed induced psychosis. I wouldn‚Äôt touch the stuff anymore if I were you. Check out r/leaves.

leaves,ezuwi2r,t3_d2hfc8,1568162205.0,Wow. Thank you for this. You‚Äôve given me a lot to think about‚Äî the ways I am missing connecting with the people in my life that I love. Thank you.
