One of the sites looked like it hadn't been renovated in years, felt like we were in 70s England. Anyway I went into one of the really disused bathrooms in one of the buildings that was barley even used. Obviously being an old building it made noises, creaks etc. I remember sitting in the toilet cubicle and I kid you not, the hand dryer went on. Obviously looking back it was just because it was old but I was bloody terrified (pun intended). I sat in that cubicle for a good 40 minutes (missed my lesson), contemplating how to get out of there. I ran out that building as fast as I could and didn't go back in.

Edit: if you don't know what Bloody Mary is it's basically a folk lore that if you say Bloody Mary 3 times in the mirror, she will appear and you will die. Me and my friends did it and so after that, I was terrified that I would come out of the toilet cubicle and see her in the mirror."
