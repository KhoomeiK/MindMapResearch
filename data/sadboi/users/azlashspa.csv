It will be tedious, frustrating. And there will be not a lot you can do if your lashes get clumped together because of an involuntary blink. My advice to you is to get a few packs of the cluster lashes (Walgreens and amazon) with rubber base duo glue.

I understand this complicated nature for many reasons, but my suggestion is to go above and beyond to show your son the kind of treatment she is neglecting. Maybe even take him on nights out just you two when it‚Äôs your time with him. Your son gets the time and attention he deserves, your wife sees time apart from your usual routine, and you get the opportunity to speak with her that you don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs getting the paternal nurturing he needs.

Also since you‚Äôre new and just starting out here are a few other tips: 
Next restaurant you go to offer your waitress or bartender a deal or discount then offer a limited time deal for anyone she works with within a small window. It‚Äôs an amazing way to build regulars, get the practice you‚Äôll always be needing, AND server/bartenders get looked at every day. You want that kind of business for sure. I did that once for a brewery and had to close down the deal after two weeks. 
Also keep ordering new multi-length trays from different companies to really decide which lash you love to work with most and get each tray in a different curl. There are SOOO many but having all of them on hand in multitrays will come in handy when working with all sorts of different lashes and eyelids.

depression,f0myppt,t3_d5eo29,1568756194.0,"My drinking drives me crazy... and instead of stopping I switched things up. For sleeping (because I would try to chug so I could go to bed at a decent time) I switched to melatonin spray. The spray is way different cause it hits your saliva and is in your system quicker. And the drinking itself, I challenged myself to try a new drink each day and only stick to drinking that. I see the tall boy thing is your thing... but 4 of those is like 2 seven&seven‚Äôs. Get your tush to a bar instead of the basement just to talk to other people but also find out what other kind of drinks you might like. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre reaching out via Reddit, and my advise might not be the best in all of this lol. But I‚Äôve been there, and I‚Äôm satisfied with my 2-3 drinks instead of 5-7 because of changing things up."
eyelashextensions,ezwg0gc,t3_d2r634,1568215816.0,I‚Äôm proud of how my lash clients natural lashes stay in tact because of proper isolation and weight distribution. Please find a lash artist that appreciates this and you will be able to remove your extensions and have healthy full natural lashes still.

Parenting,ezuq1u1,t3_d27kr0,1568158422.0,"This has been one of my fears in life. My son‚Äôs biological father is in the same boat and I‚Äôm in the same boat as you... been with his step dad for 7 years and they have an amazing relationship. My son still has a bit of idolizing of his real dad as he is a very imaginative boy, but doesn‚Äôt ask about him much anymore. He‚Äôs 11 and sees him maybe once a year when he shows up for no reason... but I have a fear in my gut one day that we will be at his funeral together. Two weeks ago I got a call from his dad because he self-institutionalized himself and wanted to talk to my son to help him feel better. I told him no but encouraged him myself that we are rooting for him to live his best life and hopefully get things healthy for himself. I read this and my heart sank for you. I‚Äôm happy you are in a good place and that his life decisions didn‚Äôt stop you from thriving. But I‚Äôm also sad he didn‚Äôt get his life together in time to see the joy you found. My condolences to your son and family."

Elementary school-high school-college-career.... bla bla bla... it gets pushed onto us like a race to finish life first. The best thing you can do for yourself is let go of whatever expectations you think are being placed on you by others or your inner demons. Give yourself grace today my friend. Deep breaths
eyelashextensions,eyy9beg,t3_czgnm1,1567576222.0,"You should most definitely talk to your artist. Perhaps her glue wasn‚Äôt fresh, or perhaps yes they were too long. She needs to know what happened and if you don‚Äôt like the response or feel comfortable trying again I suggest talking to another artist about it. I appreciate all the feedback my clients give. Makes me a better artist."

It‚Äôs why I stay with my good ol‚Äôfashioned and reliable chain restaurants! They fear being sued too much to keep you around when you‚Äôre off the clock.

eyelashextensions,ewx998a,t3_cqlsqo,1565849211.0,"How often do you wear makeup? If not often, then don‚Äôt go crazy on over cleaning. If you do wear makeup be sure to use a lash serum to swipe them with after eyeshadows so it takes off any excess powder, then when removing your makeup take a Qtip to the lid line. Using the lash soap with the brush every day can be a bit much for your lids and can get in the way of retention. Glad to hear you are curious on how to properly take care of your lashes!"
