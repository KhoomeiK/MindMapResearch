pokemon,fqu5u5a,t3_gkxkff,1589652602.0,"Some ideas:

-catch the third encounter on the route;

-no weakening or statusing the encounter;

-catch first two encounters;

-catch the rarest encounter in the area;

-catch first Pok√©mon with a type adv to your starter/first mon in the party/etc;

-catch first mon to damage your Pok√©mon in battle (ie if you‚Äôve been one-shotting things, fishing for magikarp, or the wild mons have been spamming non-damaging moves, you catch the first thing to land a hit)

Hopefully some of these are useful to you!"
