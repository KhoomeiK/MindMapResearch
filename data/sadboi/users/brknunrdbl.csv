CPTSD,f5msvmm,t3_cizckb,1572293319.0,Mine was finding a therapist who had experienced TRAUMA first hand. If they only have an intellectual understanding of trauma I often feel they don’t truly understand.

Seriously, if I throw a fucking brick off the roof and it smashes your mother fucking head, saying I didn’t intend to give you a cement craniotomy doesn’t give you back your mother fucking ability to function as a whole human!!!"

BipolarReddit,f5md6lb,t1_f5btr16,1572288820.0,"Being 4’8” garners similar attention. Met a SUPER tall guy at a restaurant with a great sense of humor once. Just standing next to each other, he looks WAY down and exclaimed “damn you’re short” and I IN turn looked WAY up giggled and said “damn you’re tall”. 
At least he knew not to use me as a flipping arm rest, lol."

CPTSD,f5bhchh,t1_f5axd0d,1572121479.0,LOOOOOVVVVVEEEEE this: “cubic shit ton”. Permission to thieve it and use it obsessively for the rest of my natural life?
depression_help,f57uz66,t3_dn27p6,1572043694.0,I started using boost shakes since they are premade. Still lost 20lbs but I didn’t get hangry and hurt anyone.
CPTSD,f4ykfhx,t3_dm7ajt,1571878556.0,"I’m horrified that you experienced this treatment in what is supposed to be a “safe space”. 

Sadly, it’s pretty damn common. Keep searching as there are medical professionals who aren’t afraid of the “unknown, and uncomfortable” and who know how to BE with a trauma victim. 

Shit part is if you had told them it was a car wreck, they’d have been comforting you and commiserating."
CPTSD,f4yj6sf,t3_dm3xul,1571877699.0,"Have any of you read  “The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma”
Book by Bessel van der Kolk?

It explained a lot of my physical symptoms and was eye opening."
CPTSD,f4x0wmg,t3_dm3xul,1571861530.0,"I’ve got a morbid need to know EVERYTHING that happened to me. 

1. What happened helps me understand where I am and why

2. I want to know what I did to harm anyone else so I can NEVER do it again"
CPTSD,f4w7hz8,t3_dm2hxz,1571852710.0,"For me it’s the utter lack of trust.

I don’t trust that they don’t mean me harm. 
I don’t believe that I matter or deserve their notice much less their good will. 
I don’t believe or trust that they know better. 
I don’t trust that they have my best interest at heart."
Dissociation,f4vutxo,t3_dlsv44,1571848136.0,"dissociation, derealization, depersonalization.

I struggle with all three due to C-PTSD from childhood abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse. It’s been compounded by being re-victimized as I am still looping rather than processing and healing. 

Now that I have a child, it has become so much worse. There are times I’m caring for him and the hands holding him aren’t mine. Discipline has been a real struggle because I felt like three people in that moment.  My child self, my abusive caretakers, and me as I am today. I would become so overwhelmed by the cacophony of emotions bombarding me that I’d just leave. 

During moments of abuse I’ve disconnected completely from my body and watched as a spectator. 

I too struggle with the way people relate to me and my “issues” on a day to day basis. WHY should I have to explain my entire life story just for you to look at me dumbfounded and saying you just don’t understand. 

I don’t owe anyone a MFin’ explanation unless my actions are causing harm. 

First post, please excuse any errors."
