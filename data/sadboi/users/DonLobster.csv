Hes not abusive any more, at least the throwing stuff, he still shouts if I interrupt his game but its reduced if I stay in my room, I'm just set off a bit because I can hear him play wow.

Re counselling and therapy, that's also on hold due to lockdown. I'm taking steps but I just needed to vent because the loneliness is hitting me pretty hard."

You are a young woman with your whole life ahead of you. To keep this pregnancy would mean dealing with lack of potential support from the father, any grandparents and also an 18+ year commitment to another human being.

You cant afford to get an abortion, so you cant afford to raise the child. Yes you could get help but a child should never be used as punishment. If I got hit by a car, me not getting medical help should not be the consequence of that action. 

Your mom might not agree with it, but to be honest, she is not the one who will have to go through with the pregnancy or  the raising of this child. 

You alone can make that choice. I would say to keep this from her if she cannot be supportive. 

If you wanted to keep it, I would also say NTA. It's your choice. Do whats best for you."
AmItheAsshole,fiq4yqg,t1_fins4gj,1582635249.0,"Hopefully I can explain why it comes off wrong 

You're a woman yourself, you have hobbies and interests etc, but the terms come off as ""these 20 year olds are cookie cutter that I will assume like the same things and I absolutely will not get along with them on that basis alone"" 

That's why someone else in this thread referenced ""not like other girls""

The point is that these 20 year olds might have the same hobbies and interests and childfree status as you, but you're making assumptions based on their hormone / gender status and age.

Everyone has a mix of hormones as well, and estrogen does way more than just affect your uterus? Like it's not even a good descriptor."
