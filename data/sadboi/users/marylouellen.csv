dating,fkq7jq9,t3_fjumsv,1584433893.0,"Fuck I am so here with you! 

This crisis would be so much easier to weather with somebody with you. My family lives in a different city, my university has closed down and anxiety might kill me before the virus!

Realise it pales in comparison to a public health crisis, but the loneliness is real. Human touch, someone to chat with, watch movies with after working from home would make this so much easier. I am legitimately considering adopting a dog to have someone with me. 

Even though we're alone, at least we're alone in solidarity. At least we're young and healthy and should be okay in September when god-willing (and I am NOT religious but God or goddesses fucking willing!!!) this is over. We can focus on helping the people around us as much as we can. 

Something helping me feel more hopeful is working with a friend who's work has been cancelled for the next month (at least) on a project we've been talking about for a long time and cooking loads of healthy food! And excercising the pain away. A good workout playlist goes a long way!

Sending good vibes!"

I'm really terrified of needing to quarantine! Going into campus and working with people keeps me sane. I know the quarantine makes sense from a public health perspective but my mental health will be... Quite bad. Fingers crossed this passes soon."
dating_advice,fk00fl7,t3_ffn8vm,1583736176.0,"Firstly - don't think it was sex on the first date that made him ghost you. Don't let these assholes (probably 100% men) tell you it's because you slept with him too soon. I've been ghosted after sex on the third date, the fourth... What a waste of time. At least you had a good night. Always do what feels right and natural. 

There's no way to make the sting of rejection go away immediately. Just trust that it will and also that you absolutely have a right to feel hurt by his behaviour. We should not be chill about this level of disdain. A few of my friends have started just doing lunch or brunch or coffee for a first date in an attempt to weed out the fuckboys like this. 

Solidarity!"
dating,fhoi3oy,t3_f44ijz,1581757862.0,"Thank-you so much for posting this! I hate it when women's experiences are devalued because they're playing the dating game on ""easy mode"". We are so often just treated as bodies and commodities it seriously wears you down."
dating,ez77od2,t1_ez53t9a,1567719967.0,"To see a woman and determine her worth to you based on how sexually attractive she is, is the definition of objectification. You can't have a friendship with an object, and therefore you find it difficult to connect with women. There are plenty of women who are interested in the same things you are - you've just discounted them based on an extremely shallow metric. So the first step here is recognising yourself making these snap judgements that stop you from fully connecting with people. Take a step back, ask her how her day is, realise she has a full life and worth beyond her attractiveness. You may find a stimulating conversation is just as sexy as I don't know - big boobs and waist length hair."
dating,ez4h1ip,t3_czwkav,1567686741.0,"Wow. With an attitude like this, most girls probably feel the same way about you (minus the wanting to bang part, gender stereotypes are somehow a huuuuge turn off). To be able to have a conversation with someone, you need to view them as fully human and be actually interested in them. So the first step is being interested in a woman's life beyond how much you want to fuck her, if that's not too hard for your big astrophysics man brain."
socialskills,ez4fvux,t3_czzru6,1567686233.0,"On my favourite first date we met at the big old library in our city, then walked to the art gallery where there are always free exhibits on. Anything you can be looking at and talking about together is good, and if you need to compose yourself a little because you're anxious you can just pretend to be really into something on the other side of the room. There's also a little restaurant there so we were able to have some wine and chat when we felt more comfortable. 

Good luck!!!"
dating,ez3zhjd,t1_ez0smz4,1567678279.0,"If neither of you had any relationship experience, you probably have no experience of dating either. Am happy for your relationship but this is really something you have no idea about. The world of casual dating is an emotional minefield."
dating,eyvimkx,t3_cyz9pz,1567496199.0,I have 100% done this. You're not lying to them - you DID meet him at a bar! You had just organised the meeting over a dating app. I know dating apps have been more and more normalised but sometimes you just want the illusion.
socialskills,eyvi0ey,t3_cywoub,1567495335.0,"I have this problem too. If I feel awkward about recognising someone and wanting to talk to them but not know how to approach, I'll catch their eye and do a little wave. For some reason the wave is less intimidating then a spoken hello. If you get a wave back you can approach or leave it, but most of the time they'll approach after the wave. If you can't catch their eye... Then it's like jumping into cold water and you just gotta do it. Even now I'll sometimes be too anxious though (particularly around people I think are really cool or I'm attracted to) and I'm trying to be less hard on myself for it. Like ""I couldn't jump today but next time I will"". 

People also love their own names. So instead of a ""hello"" sometimes I'll opt for a name. And then they say your name!!! And then you laugh and chat!!! Still a jump into cold water, but a confident jump with assurance of response."
relationships,eyt8nnh,t3_cygqky,1567429209.0,"Please don't shame him for just wanting to spend time with his friends and enjoy himself. It's totally understandable that you're frustrated but I know pleeeenty of 24 year olds who aren't home all weekend because they've been partying, or had multiple social engagements or go away. The way he spends time with his friends is that they hang out and sleepover together (low-key sounds fun wish my friends did this). It isn't the ""sleepovers"" that are the problem it's that he's prioritising his friends over you. Which is a reason to leave someone if you want something more serious. But the talk of this being ""childish"" is way judgemental, you both just have different priorities right now."
relationships,eynnd8n,t3_cxtf98,1567253602.0,"You deserve an active and fulfilling sex life. Your boyfriend is a selfish lover (if you can even call it that). His expectations on you to be comfortable with ""tittyfucking"" him and giving him ""buttjobs"" (btw no disrespect but wtf even is this shit? Is his only sex ed from porn?) but offering zero pleasure for you in return is objectifying and disrespectful. You need to reiterate to him that a ""relationship"" is a two way street, you don't exist solely for his pleasure, you are a human with needs. He's uncomfortable with oral (have you asked why? If you can understand where he's coming from you might be able to find things that are mutually pleasurable), and he's uncomfortable with penetration - could he pleasure you using fingers or using a toy? Could you two watch porn together and talk about what you find sexy? You need to flag that this matters to you and that you want to set aside some time to explore sexual pleasure in a way that you're both comfortable with and open to. 

You don't want to hear it, but a 23 year old dating a 16 year old is a hugely imbalanced power dynamic. That dynamic hasn't changed. He doesn't view you as a full, sexual being with her own wants. He views you an object for his pleasure when he wants it. You have so much time to experiment and find what you enjoy sexually and orgasm multiple times with multiple partners in multiple positions - don't trap yourself with someone who doesn't respect you. If he isn't receptive to your questions or suggestions then it's time to leave or enjoy celibacy."
dating,eyc56j1,t3_cwf784,1566996681.0,"Commenting in support here! Dating apps turn people into commodities, but when you've got very little time on your hands often it's the only way to meet someone. Don't have an answer except to say - don't lose faith! Go to meetups, get involved with the school, strike up conversations. Who knows. 

Mostly also wanted to comment to say don't listen to these assholes who've clearly never spoken to a live woman saying ""lower your standards"". Sheesh. No wonder it's hard to find someone."

Most of it is made up bullshit anyway. I used to check an ex's insta every few weeks to see what he's been up to because he's a semi cool artist I'm maybe not over, and it's all just bullshit. I've seen his life. That's not his life. There aren't any pics of him spending 8hrs in his room working on some crap he'll never release.

dating,ex1oex0,t3_cqg2mc,1565951570.0,"What are you guilty about? You don't owe anything to either of these people. You are way too early in both of these situations to be able to evaluate whether you want to be monogamous or pursue a serious relationship with either of them. You could go out with both next week and they could both try to knife you or something. Don't get ahead of yourself, if you like them both and respect them both then go on a date with each of them next week. If you're looking for a serious relationship you could try holding off on sex with them both on these dates and just see who you mesh better with on a personality level. That said there isn't anything ethically dubious about sleeping with them both. Just use protection, and do NOT while putting on the condom say ""I'm seeing someone else and she wants me to use this"" as has happened to me. That'll really ruin things."

lonely,ewi92g8,t3_cofzo9,1565442845.0,"This is the paradox of social media - you may have 700 friends or followers who, when you make a throwaway post mentioning how you feel will respond with care but when you've been in doom town without leaving the house for two weeks straight and just stare blankly at anything that moves those same people will stop answering texts, be very busy, or you'll feel too distant to reach out to them. We have the appearance of community but none of the actual infrastructure. So it may be frustrating to you to see this (so much about social media is just inherently frustrating and saddening) know that just as that person has no idea what's going on in your life you have no idea what's going on in theirs. 

Also worth remembering that loneliness isn't a physical state it's a mental one. You can be lonely at a party, you can be lonely at work, you can be lonely on the couch with your family and greyhound or whatever. By invalidating these people's experiences you're only enhancing your own suffering. We're all here just doing our best and you're isolating yourself further with this ""me vs them"" (them being ""normies"") mentality. We can all learn from each other's experiences. 

I have a handful of friends I see each week, a job where I like my coworkers, a boy I sometimes date, a family I talk to on the phone. And I am often crippled by loneliness. We aren't in a competition here. We can work together to feel better and start to dismantle the systems and expectations that make us feel this way."

Love and loneliness are definitely intertwined - when you're lonely you try and fill yourself up with anything vaguely person shaped. Then when you realise they aren't ever going to care things feel double as bad. I've spent the last three months fantasising about my last ex contacting me not because I miss him or want him but because I was using him to fill up so many parts of myself that just felt empty."

depression,etmsf90,t3_ccbkzn,1562967421.0,"You can explore your sexuality on your own! Use your hands, use a vibrator and different toys to figure out what feels good to you. Being a virgin at 25 is not as odd as you think it is, and understanding your body will hopefully reduce the anxiety surrounding sex. It's not perfect but sometimes I'll go to bellesa.com which specialises in porn for women (some of it is trash tho but see if you can find something that turns you on).

It sounds like at this point in time you have bigger fish to fry than losing your virginity - finding motivation, dealing with social isolation, finding self worth. Sex can often just muddy these things further. 

As someone who's had a lot of the experiences you mention, a lot of these things are honestly not fun or desirable. Waking up with a pounding headache next to someone you wouldn't have slept with sober is not a good feeling, and the sex that results from ingesting enough substances to feel good about yourself is never good or rewarding. These people online might laugh about it and rack up a ""count"" but if you ask the partner in these situations they may well have a very different take on things. 

There is no harm in waiting until the right time. Sex is best when you are comfortable in your skin and comfortable with your partner, whether they are someone you want a relationship with or not. It's ultimately a form of communication. Just a kind of weird one. 

You really aren't behind at all. Sex is like eating, your body knows what to do, there's really nothing to it. I don't know if this will help but it's great little profile in the guardian of people who lost their virginity in their 30s and the story behind it:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/24/i-wanted-sex-on-my-terms-and-it-was-readers-on-the-joy-of-losing-your-virginity-in-your-30s"

When I have a depressive episode that stops me from working I usually say that I've had a migraine, which I can spin to a doctor too to write me a note.

Even if you get a late penalty you can still probably submit and pass!! 

It sounds like for your situation taking time off study might be a good idea though. I dropped out of my last course 2 years ago because I kept coming up against these situations. Racked up student debt without going to class or finishing assignments. University is awful for your mental health, and education systems are generally inflexible. 

Back at it now! Now the opposite is true and when I'm not doing an assignment I'm really adrift and have no meaning in life. Can't win really."
