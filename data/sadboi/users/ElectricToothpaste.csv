But I think the band that sounds the most to me like the actual world ending is probably Neurosis, particularly their album Through Silver in Blood. They closed with the title track when I saw them a couple of years ago, and it was one of the only times in my adult life when music actually made me feel fear. Not like the music was going to get me, but like an asteroid might crash into the earth.

The album that I think captures the current mood right now, though, is Boards of Canada’s Tomorrow’s Harvest. The whole album sounds like a desolate, empty space where there used to be a lot of people."

The original mix is *my* preferred version, because there are so many elements missing from the remix, but they weren't removed from the remix by choice. They just weren't there on the tape when they went to remix it. (If I'm remembering right, certain parts were played/sung directly to two-track during the mixdown process, so they never actually had their own separate tracks on the multitrack tapes.)
