(but also, you don't really need to wait until you've got a printer! i tend to copy out my mental health worksheets by hand because it sort of gets me more familiar with them before i even do them, and i do them in nice colours so they're like, more approachable. or you could just keep it up on your phone and write in bullet-points in a notebook or something!)"
ADHD,fqtyxl6,t1_fqtydfa,1589648783.0,"tbh i don't remember exactly what they said about it because i had this appointment w my uni disability services a year ago. but i remember them telling me about 2 places which offered a private diagnosis and i briefly considered it, which i only wouldve if it was <£200-300. but yeah everywhere that comes up online is £600 at least.

Honestly. my adult autism diagnosis on the NHS was absolutely a lottery. i lived in manchester at the time and got through and diagnosed in maybe 4 months. i have friends who live in coventry who've gotta wait 2 years for the same thing. its a fucking mess."
ADHD,fqtxvft,t1_fqtxeuc,1589648210.0,"yeah, from other medication i'm on, i know what we do is a shared care plan. but that's because it's something which GPs don't know enough about to be able to monitor my blood levels etc. so the private place has to keep me to monitor my bloods and things. but with adhd meds, i don't know what would need sustained measuring, that i'd need to stay with the adhd clinic for?

Warwick uni, why?"
BPD,fqtxkbp,t1_fqtvh43,1589648044.0,"god that's such a big relate. it's so fucking hard being so self-aware that your thoughts and emotions are disordered but still being unable to stop them.

like. in my morals, i believe that your romantic partner shouldn't be the centre of your whole life. i've always really strongly believed that's unhealthy, the fact our culture basically tells people their partner should be their Only person and the Centre of their life. but then the moment i got in a romantic relationship my thoughts were *utterly* obsessive, even though i badly didn't want to be that way and i hated myself more for it.

honestly, at first when i was trying to make changes, i'd do the exercises and worksheets and nothing changed it was so emotionally overwhelming. it fucking sucks. the only think keeping me motivated to keep pushing to change now, is that i looked back at how hard it was 5 months ago and thought holy shit it's changed now. when i started i really didnt think it would. and now i've had that one success, it's reminding me now that when i feel like the other things i'm pushing for are hopeless, it really does work."
BPD,fqtuw6v,t3_gkx5ux,1589646577.0,"i really really relate to this. i'd never been in a romantic relationship until november when i met my now boyfriend. my thoughts about him, and emotional reactions to every single thing he did or said, were *obsessive* and i *knew* it and i *knew* how disordered and unhealthy it was but i couldnt control it. he was (and is) incredible, but my brain made it torture. i knew i wouldnt be able to date him healthily unless i did *something* about it so i dived deep into ways to manage it. it's fucking hard and at first you might really really have to force yourself, and it might not even help in the moment the first times at all. but the more times you do these things the more effect they'll have. it was a fucking painful first ~4 months of dating but by april/may i'm amazed at how much control i have. it's not perfect by any means- i'm still definitely overreliant on him for emotional validation, i do want to speak to him all the time, and i react badly to minor things- but all these things are *so* much quieter and are at a manageable level its unreal

google ""thought record sheets bpd"", you should be able to find some, just on google images. they can help us learn to realise that our thoughts are distorted. and the first few times this might not make the emotions lessen, but over time, as your brain learns to recognise its distorted thoughts, the emotions responding to those distorted thoughts get smaller. here's one [thought record sheet](https://images.app.goo.gl/Tu9X7tFkKD2DEwEL7)


also ""opposite action""- the urges we have to do things like cling, or isolate; acting on those urges makes us feel better in the moment but brings the feelings back stronger later. the key to not self-reinforcing is breaking that cycle. [problem solving](https://images.app.goo.gl/uUyiS4F2BLBmHboa7) and [problem solving 2](https://images.app.goo.gl/uUyiS4F2BLBmHboa7) and [opposite action](https://images.app.goo.gl/uUyiS4F2BLBmHboa7)

also; there's a book called ""The Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Skills Workbook"" which talks you through learning skills to calm yourself down/self-soothe when in a crisis, and to learn to regulate our emotions. (which you could fork out money for or,,, just try a very easy google search for the pdf)

sorry if this was overkill lol, it just really resonated with where i was 6 months ago. and using those top two tools (the dbt workbook i'm only starting now) whenever something came up is i believe truly the only reason my internal relationship with my partner is as good as it is. i'm so fucking glad i pushed myself into doing those things, this is now the first relationship i feel like i have *control* over how i react to in my life. even when we have conflicts; and even if he broke up with me tomorrow, i think i would be able to handle it without losing my absolute mind like i would've before. through lots of painful practice. so i wanted to offer all i could lol"
BPD,fogfy9k,t1_fogekmt,1587752080.0,"i have also been thinking, on reflection, that my ADHD and the things that came along with it might have been a factor in why i was likely to develop BPD"
BPD,fogdv8m,t3_g7d1l5,1587751315.0,"i'm afraid i don't have any advice, but to tell you that someone else feels 100% the same way. i have so many things half written, languages half learned. i get so frustrated at the feeling that i don't have any personality or sense of self because i can't commit to building any one interest for more than a few days/weeks. i also don't know if its due to me BPD or ADHD, maybe a bit of both. it sucks sometimes."
Dermatillomania,flkneht,t1_flkau5m,1585244153.0,"of course, i can do my best! it really is hard. for me, it was hard to accept that after a while i realised improvement was going to be gradual. i managed not to pick for 2 days! and then i did again. then it was half a week! and then i fell back again. recently i managed a whole week! and then i picked a little again. but try not to think of them as failures- think of them as gradual improvements. ""this time i managed X length of time. next time it'll be longer"". and it gets easier and takes so much less thought and willpower every time.

the most key thing to me was breaking/disrupting habits. these are different for everyone so i'll give you an example- every time i walked into the bathroom i would stop in front of the mirror, look at my skin, and start picking. it was so routine, several times a day, i never even really noticed it. Make note of where/when your most common, habitual picking occurs. And then habits are hard to break through sheer willpower alone- the easiest way to break them is to *disrupt* them. so that you HAVE to stop and think *before* following your subconscious routine. Before you go in the bathroom, pause and deliberately remind yourself to walk right past the mirror. Stick a post-it note on the mirror- or cover it with a towel even. maybe even rearrange your room. anything you can do to make those subconscious patterns become conscious- so you can catch yourself *before* you start picking.

as well as physical places, notice when you're most emotionally susceptible. for most people i believe it's when anxious. so if you know you're feeling anxious that week, maybe put *extra* things in place to make you notice when you're tempted to start picking

for me picking is purely something i do consciously, but if you do it subconsciously i know people can find it helpful to have someone you trust and are around often- a partner or close friend- just nudge you if they notice you picking. after a while it gets easier to start to notice it yoruself.

and as for once you've started? pause, and take a few deep steadying breaths. then when you feel ready, slowly move your hands away. take a few more deep, steadying breaths until you can walk away, or move on.

also- give your hands something else to do once you've stopped yourself. get something to fidget with- be it a fidget toy, or a ring, or something else to stop your hands being able to wander back.

I also find the accountability- of telling someone else hey this is what i'm trying to do- helps. It feels easier to ""cheat"" on a commitment only you know you've made. thats a lot, but i wanted to give everything i could think of. good luck!!"
BPD,flj1zsx,t3_fp51l3,1585196563.0,"yeah- i think for some people with mental illnesses its like... we're so used to internally dreading or waiting for the absolute worst to happen any second-- so when crisis strikes and the worst HAS happened.... well at least it's the uncertainty of waiting removed! thats how i feel anyway. also, we spend so long mentally preparing for all sorts of catastrophic things, so when something DOES happen, we're more emotionally ready than other people."
BPD,flizx5a,t3_fp49bm,1585194954.0,"i absolutely get this too. i also have been wondering if its an emotional-permanence thing. when i'm away from people for a little while, when i think about them my feelings for them have just sort of... faded. Not in a way where I no longer care about them- and as soon as I see them again the feelings are refuelled- and i still remember fondly times ive spent, care about them, think positively of them etc. But.... I don't really feel such a strong emotional tie/dependence to them after a short time away? i find it hard to vocalise, but exactly like you said- it feels like it's easier to leave it all behind. the intensity of emotional connection I feel with people is very... all or nothing i guess? they feel like Everything to me, then after a few weeks apart it's easy for them to slip out of my thoughts almost entirely, and when i think of them, i'm not saddened by the distance, despite the fact weeks ago i wouldve been"
ADHD,fliz9sl,t3_fp4iqu,1585194466.0,"routine! honestly the biggest thing that helps me is building in small routines. keeping my keys, wallet, headphones, bus pass in a box on the corner of my desk. that is where they go every day when i get in- it's ingrained, habit, and i will *never* let myself put them down anywhere else or they WILL get lost.

focus-wise? thats hard. if you have to focus on eg studying or work- environment is key. find a place where the *only* thing you associate with being there is studying. not your bedroom, or anywhere you socialise. it helps our easily sidetracked brains at least know what track they have to be on, when they're in that specific place. and learn what other things work for for you- sometimes by trial and error. for some people background music helps focus- for others it provides just another distraction.

organisation- go back to high school methods and keep a planner. no really, just drawing out a quick calendar every week/month with your plans in, having somewhere to write down important tasks during the day, or note what's due in tomorrow is basically essential with ADHD. there's apps that can help with this too, if your phone is better than a physical planner.

brute forcing it?- coffee works for some. caffeine is a stimulant- although much weaker in strength than stimulant medications obviously. but some ADHD people, when they're having a day they really can't string any focus together, can find coffee helps a little. but others find coffee does the opposite and slows them down/makes them sleepy- so this is another one to test what works for you"

needadvice,fap4duh,t3_ea9gjy,1576279573.0,"hi, I'm autistic too (and not that its relevant, but my special interest is a kpop group too lol) so trust me when I say I get this and how much it can hurt.

I'd say give yourself time, and maybe try and explore both what that member is doing solo and what the group are doing, whenever you're ready. if you want to try and stay with them, you could try rewatching some of their old stuff, if that doesnt make you too sad?

the option of moving on is easier said than done- it can be really hard to force a move of special interest. but my suggestion for how to try is- try and find something that you can link back to your old special interest, but is not exactly them. (maybe another kpop group- watch shows they're in with your old one for example). that's how I've unintentionally transferred special interests in the past; my brain still got its special-interest satisfaction from things that it could link *back* to my special interest- even if it wasnt exactly that. and eventually it just sort of moved over.

I hope this helps a little! 💕"
