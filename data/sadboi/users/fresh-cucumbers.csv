Inherently, being fat or being bald is not “bad”.  Society has told us over and over that they’re not desirable traits, they’re unwanted and they should be avoided.  If a person has low self-esteem or a broken image, it’s possible that they have an expectation of their physical appearance which is directly tied to what they have learned they should be.

bjj,fn9akpj,t3_g0c8c0,1586765450.0,"I am a woman who does BJJ and Judo. 

My partner does Judo.  It's incredible to have someone that understands most things and I can train with.  At my gym, I try to get everyone to bring their girlfriends/wives.  I want them to come along and start training.  Unfortunately, you need to have a passion for some aspect of BJJ to stick with it, but exposing them to the world that their partner is a part is a great way to have fun.  I find that when they hear about ""a woman at the gym wants you to come along"" works better for a lot of women. 

For my partner, he's serious (90% of the time, well we both are) on the mats when we do Judo together.  It's good to have an at-home training companion, it makes going more fun and easier.  It allows you to have someone that can critique you harshly (if you need it). 

I wouldn't force anyone to do anything, but I would just start asking for help with moves and positions, basically to be playdough.  ""When I do this, apply pressure"" then keep treating them as a training partner.  They're helping you.  Then after a while gauge with them how they feel.  That's how I began with Judo, my partner kept flopping me around and sweeping me randomly and I arose from the asphalt with a vengeance to learn these flying tricks.

**Do not hit on anyone at the gym** whilst training.  Wait until you are talking to maybe introduce yourself, open up another form of contact and then start a relationship and test the waters slowly.  Keep it low-key because y'all both have to stay at the same gym."

I also dread the idea of sharing the love from my significant other.  He's busy, why would I put another variable into the mix.  In the future, before I have kids I have to overcome;

* The commitment and dedication of having a child with me for 30 years 
* The potential for having any physical scarring/body issues 
* The potential that I may have a child with severe mental illness/disability 
* That I have to share everything with another human, mainly my partner

Then, I have to be at a stage in my career where I am willing to completely let-go (I want a close attachment style of parenting).  Ensure I have a house that my partner or I own, have the financial stability to live on one income and be in prime health.

I put a lot of thought into children because I was a mistake and my parents didn't think about it.  If I have a child, it's going to be when I know I can provide unconditional love and support, I can prioritise their lives over mine and my partner's - until then, no thanks."

**Edit**: Before people misconstrue my meaning.

>but why is my government putting so much funding into mental health and suicide prevention if they don't expect many deaths from it

Not sure where this statement comes from. Government funding for mental health services is there in place to prevent suicides. Considering many organisations/services lack funding, or there are many places without organisations/services, there should ideally be *more* funding. The issue with mental health is that it can affect anyone which means services need to exist and be accessible at all times. Mental health trends also make it difficult when choosing whether to allocate funding in certain areas. For example if a Suburb A had a 10% increase in suicides in 2020, but Suburb B had a 10% decrease in suicides in 2020, then funding would be shifted to cater for the increase but then Suburb B also increases due to lack of funding and Suburb A is still increasing.

Funding information:

* [Australian Insitute of Health and Welfare](https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports/mental-health-services/mental-health-services-in-australia/report-contents/expenditure-on-mental-health-related-services)
* [Aus Gov: Department of Health 2018-2019 budget](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/collections/health-budget-2019-20)
* [Parliament of Australia: 2018-2019 budget summary](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/BudgetReview201819/MentalHealth)

>But now I really feel that my government is in their way contributing to my early death in so many other ways.

How? Is this because there is too much funding? Is this due to your hobbies/services/needs not being fulfilled? What are the ""so many"" ways in which they are contributing to your death?

>I'm just thinking I'll be a statistic from that being sacrificed for the greater good with no help for my mental health being at all

Everyone is a statistic, but I understand the sentiment. You open with a question asking why the government is putting SO MUCH funding into mental health, then suggest they may be contributing to your death, then suggest you are going to be sacrificed with no help for your mental health.

>I'm just expressing how I feel right now on here as in reality now I have no one else at all that I can see or speak to about anything

I'm glad you are expressing your emotions - it's important. During this difficult time, I truly believe there are other subreddits dedicated to assisting those in emotional turmoil or anguish.

To assist, here are some subreddits: r/mentalhealth, r/bipolar, r/depression, r/relationship_advice, r/BipolarReddit, r/CPTSD, r/BPD, r/SuicideWatch, r/advice, r/lgbt, r/OCD, r/ForeverAlone, r/anxiety just to name a few.

queensland,fmbxgox,t1_flmz6py,1585935004.0,"For anyone reading this, it is no longer correct.  You may only exercise with one other person."
queensland,fmbxaiz,t1_flmpoju,1585934915.0,"I feel bad going to Woolworths for food, I spend no longer than 10 minutes inside, do everything by the book.  Then I come home and my MIL tells me about her trip to Ikea.  GOD DAMN IT WOMAN YOU DON’T NEED AN INDIVIDUAL CURTAIN HOOK WHEN YOU’RE NEARLY 60 Oh WHAT’S THAT? YOU TOOK YOUR 75 YEAR OLD FRIEND THAT’S FROM THE CITY? OH GREAT!"
queensland,fmbwty6,t3_fqftwu,1585934676.0,"There should be stops that have the same restrictions at the border for city highways.  If only workers are supposed to travel, traffic should be minimal enough to allow for a lane designated for workers (that have proof they’re working) and then everyone else can be stopped and expected to provide evidence of their reason for travel.  The city is the densest with the highest positive number.  People shouldn’t be leaving to other places just for the fun of it or if they’re bored."
queensland,fmbw5je,t3_fs6zmx,1585934324.0,Say we request a border permit as a Queensland resident?  How do they check this?  What do they require from us?
queensland,fmbv437,t3_fteve8,1585933771.0,"https://www.covid19.qld.gov.au/government-actions/border-closing#exempt-person

This is basically the same."
queensland,fmbt0n5,t3_ftjlm2,1585932668.0,"The police near us have been driving around stopping near parks, car parks to see people in their cars and that to watch gatherings. 

I wish there was official information released by the police/government (maybe there is) about border crossings.  Are they stopping everyone 24/7 crossing the border into Queensland?  Would they deny anyone entering?  Are our names being registered to be checked in case they see us out when we are doing the travel two-week quarantine? 

So many questions."
DiWHY,fmbrxuf,t3_fuapmk,1585932106.0,"No, we mustn’t tell them, they have to learn."
unpopularopinion,fmbrg5p,t3_fuah8p,1585931846.0,"I believe teachers should get paid more. 

This should begin a domino effect that has higher standards being expected.  In Australia, you do a degree, then teaching masters, then sit an interview (with a few other ways).  It’s not exactly rocket science to become a teacher.  If they make it a higher standard, then hopefully people won’t see it as a back-up plan. 

I know for me, most of my teachers were shit.  I think the teaching degree teaches you how to teach on paper but doing it in real life is different and requires practice.  It’s hard to monitor whether they’re doing their job well (yes marks, but what about students who care and do their own self-directed learning?).  When students critique a teacher, most will be ignored. 

I just know many teachers don’t care and maybe they do and their passionate but after a few years, you should have your shit together to the point where you can focus on your teaching methods."
AskWomen,fmb6w25,t1_fm8f691,1585919891.0,I’ve wanted to shave my head for about 15 years and this is the first comment I’ve read that’s realistic about it.
AskWomen,fmb6lae,t1_fm9o3ga,1585919680.0,I enjoyed reading this comment!
AskWomen,fmb6g7z,t3_fu3rnh,1585919575.0,"Before my current partner as he has been the only exception for this.  It’s better to be alone.  I prefer loneliness.  It comes from a love of peace and solitude.  It comes from being okay with myself.  The only way to become okay with being alone, is by practicing reaching the needs of what you look for with other people."
AskWomen,fmb4j7m,t3_fu6hyp,1585918117.0,"My partner is currently away for work and I hate it.  I hate it, partly because quarantine took away my hobbies (close-contact sports).  Before him I cherished being alone - no family, no friends, no visitors, even with boyfriends, I found alone time great and dreamt of a future isolated from everyone not worrying if that included a partner. 

My current partner, anytime away and I hate it.  It sucks.  IT SUUUUCCKKKSSSS."
AskWomen,fmb3hay,t3_fu6qk1,1585917295.0,The best thing is to start working on replacing motivation with discipline.  Then you’ll never be left abandoned.
interestingasfuck,fmayf66,t3_fu61p9,1585912676.0,Definitely beautiful but I’m still terrified.
sydney,fmawg8m,t3_fu504c,1585910526.0,I’m laughing but I’m scared.
AskWomen,fm6b7vu,t1_fm3z9ke,1585790236.0,"What the actual heck?!  The amount of stories I hear about women being attacked (and yes, it’s against the BJJ rules so what else do we call it?) because people can’t control themselves is disgusting.  I always match the energy of someone but if they’re all ego then it’s game on."
AskWomen,fm69sr6,t1_fm5bqxe,1585789339.0,Quarantine must have you bored if you’re going through a post from a couple days ago and attempting to correct grammar.  Both are acceptable.  Get over it.
