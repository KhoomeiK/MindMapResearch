Think if you actually do all of the things you are capable to do in your day and don't feel bad about being home and doing nothing. I've been in the same situation 1 month now and i felt awful but i thought okay keep calm you don't do this on purpose, deal with it and get some rest at home"

I understand that every client is different, they are here to relax and treat their selfs, if they want to discuss something its okay if they don't that's okay too. I just want to leave from my place happy and satisfied ðŸ˜Š"
Target,f54xs16,t3_dmtxwp,1571994553.0,"If everyone on the department is complaining about the TL I don't think that you will get in any trouble, besides if she gets fired they can bring you someone new and more experienced to manage the things better. Also I think that the HR will remember that you tell him the truth about the things that going on and appreciate it. You didn't tell anything but the truth you have nothing to be afraid of, otherwise the tl had to tell you to keep this things secret if she didn't want to tell it to anyone who asked you."
