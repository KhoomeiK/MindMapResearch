Have you considered the possibility that there may be an underlying factor that makes you want to drink even when you're in a positive situation?

It definitely has not gone away but I'm much more likely to be able to level out when I'm freaking out because she hasn't texted back in over .0001 seconds. Also at my new job I literally cannot text while I'm working and I think being in that position forces me to recognize that sometimes a person simply cannot give me the attention I need. As far as reading too much into things I've started to look at myself and my behavior and think about how I would react if I were on the receiving end and I've realized that I act in the exact same ways that set me off. And I know that I'm not doing that stuff because I don't love her, it's just an off day or I'm having to rush to send a text for whatever reason or something else, but never that I don't love her anymore.
