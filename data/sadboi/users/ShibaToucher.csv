I am still struggling with motivation but suicidal ideation has gone down for now. I have made steps towards improving my life and I’m hoping when those start to kick in everything will be better. 

You said you went off antidepressants, were you better by the time you did that? Or just decided they weren’t for you? I really want to get off mine, but I’m on a lot and I’m not sure if they’re helping or hindering my progress. 

I hope everything is well with you. Thanks for writing."

2. Oddly enough, no. My mind was so set on killing myself that turning into the median was all I could think about.

I will have to force myself to do it every day until it truly becomes a habit, that way I will do it regardless of my mood.

Regarding the speed of the crash, I merely remember looking down at my speedometer which was maxed out just before impact. I do not remember anything that happened after that. It is likely I may have hit the median in just a way to avoid a head-on collision. I know it sounds like an exaggeration but just like you and me, everyone was surprised I survived.
