hsp,fn0k0d2,t3_fyis6q,1586543348.0,"Wow.. I literally just finished writing in my journal & it was no joke almost exactly the same situation.. down to asking if it’s something I just have to accept & deal with. Definitely taking it as a wink from the universe that just working through it and trying to understand is exactly what we should be doing, regardless of the outcome (stay together or part ways). 

I understand where you’re coming from, it can be so frustrating and almost invalidating. Feeling like we’re asking too much, or from a different planet and our needs/boundaries are entirely foreign to them. I struggle with this often, despite going on 3 years. I know he’s a good person and doesn’t show love in the same way, but I go back and forth on whether or not I’m selling myself short, settling for less than I deserve.. 

I’m not sure. I really don’t have the answers as I’m still working through this same thing. We both went through some pretty messed up childhoods and there’s definitely a lot of trauma on each side, but we’ve internalized & deal with it in totally different ways that it’s hard to feel like there’s common ground when it comes to conflict or trying to get him to see where I’m coming from. 

I just want to say that I see you, I hear you. Your thoughts & feelings are valid. It is okay to feel frustrated, even if you love the person. It doesn’t mean either party is right or wrong.. it’s just a matter of whether or not we can truly see a clear path forward in the relationship, a path that allows us more peace of mind & understanding. 

Here for you OP. Ps-thank you for sharing & helping me to feel less alone."

No words lessen that pain of losing a loved one--furry or not, so please take it easy and keep her memory alive with some posts on here. You’re definitely in a space where your situation and related feelings are seen, heard & understood. Pets are a forever gift to us. ❤️"
offmychest,fjx7ano,t3_ffa9mu,1583660139.0,"I’m so sorry to hear that, I know some would pass this off as no big deal but you were concerned for the well-being of another creature and for it to pass in such a way is upsetting. You tried to rescue it and made the best of the situation, that’s what you should try to remind yourself of if it starts to bug you at all—you are kind and compassionate. Now you know some quick fixes at the house which will help to prevent similar occurrences in the future. Take it easy. ❤️"

BorderlinePDisorder,f6nbjys,t3_ds4vrj,1572988137.0,"I started smoking every day in university to cope with really bad depression and what I would later come to learn to be symptoms of bpd. Initially it was with friends and I was still functioning, going to class, working. But as the depression worsened, so did my consumption, which made me less motivated and more dissociated, like a vicious cycle. Getting high all day long to deal with anxiety, ADHD, depression, feeling disconnected. I intended to take a year off as I was verging suicidal, but I have continued smoking excessively and for me, it has become a very unhealthy crutch which is ultimately worsening my symptoms of bpd, particularly depression and feelings of dissociation. 

I have been seeing a mental health & addictions counsellor because, although it’s pot and not “technically” addictive, I’ve become incredible dependent on it. Addiction is very heavily present on both sides of my family, mostly alcohol. My father has been an alcoholic for over 30 years and it was part of the reason I had to move out on my own at 16 and have since had to deal with a lot of trauma and neglect issues. Knowing that addiction is genetic, I look at the counselling as a preventative measure. In my follow-up appointments with my psychiatrist after being diagnosed, he really stressed the importance of trying to cut it out since it can have negative effects when also trying to treat bpd, and it honestly makes me really lazy and incapable of following through with most stuff (with the way that I have been using.) 

Weed can be amazing for so many people, especially when considering the various ways of consuming, different strains, etc. I believe it should totally be legal and accessible for people to use as an alternative to big pharma when able to, but I also think there should be a healthy balance. For me, it started great. Social, giggly, deep talks. But I have turned it into a very unhealthy coping mechanism, which is why I’m in counselling to learn healthier ways of being present with my thoughts and feelings instead of immediately going to numb myself briefly. I’m starting DBT therapy very soon, so I’ve made it my personal goal to steadily reduce until I no longer *need* to smoke all day every day, giving me the ability to be more clear-minded and really start acting on the changes I see need to be made in my life."
BorderlinePDisorder,f6h5l10,t3_dr4men,1572837568.0,"You aren’t alone. Ever. 

I’m sorry to hear about the job, I know it can be frustrating when you had different expectations for something. That being said, you’re totally valid in feeling upset—it’s a stressful situation. I’ve read more and more about BPD over the past year and this is definitely one thing I consistently struggle with. It feels as though I can be having a normal day, or an average week, and even something as small as a thought of a plan not working could completely throw me off and start to feel like there’s no point in any of it, it’s all to exhausting, etc. 

But that’s the thing! It’s part of the mental illness, a symptom, not something that defines who we are or the potential of who we can become. It’s still hard for me even if I’m aware that I’m dissociating to actually choose coping skills. I’ve just started DBT and CBT therapy and groups so I hope that will help. I would say if you don’t already have a counsellor or therapist, it has been the biggest help for me to have an unbiased person I don’t feel will judge me and I can be totally honest and receive the feedback and resources I desperately need. Now just the practice!

We’ve got this. You will be okay. I promise. Trust in the universe, it’s calming sometimes just to let go and allow yourself to really believe that everything is as it’s meant to be—even when it feels like the total opposite. ❤️"
BorderlinePDisorder,f5yu5m2,t1_f5w6cny,1572561676.0,"It brings so much comfort just to realize your problems aren’t YOU problems, they’re just things a lot of people deal with but we all think it’s just us so we all keep it to ourselves, rinse & repeat. I think I’m going to try to mention it to her because it’s so unhealthy for my mindset to have one around especially in such a used space because my mind sees it and immediately wants to know if I’ve gained or lose even 0.5lb. I don’t want to live my life that way, we all have so much more to offer than our physical appearances. That’s awesome though, I really admire you for having the strength to overcome that habit you realized wasn’t going to benefit you long-term. It actually gives me a lot of hope that I can do the same for myself, having heavily relied on pot for over 2 years through university to numb those feelings trying to get through school, but it has stuck and my brain has kept to it since it’s the easiest path. I’m seeing a mental health & addiction counsellor as addiction, mainly alcoholism, is incredibly prevalent on both sides of my family and I know I’m at a much higher risk of developing addictions. Thank you for being a light! ❤️☀️ cheers"
BorderlinePDisorder,f5vnv3n,t1_f5v5pbi,1572494049.0,"Never alone, no matter how great our minds may be at convincing us sometimes. I won’t eat much most days then some days I literally can’t stop snacking and I want all the “junk” food. I’ve also tried to avoid having a scale around for the past year and a half, but my roommate put one in our living-room a few weeks ago and not having the courage currently to voice something that brings me discomfort, it has stayed there and I have relapsed and begun obsessively weighing myself every day, always in the morning before eating or drinking. And every time it makes me feel so sad for myself, but as if it’s something I *have* to do in another attempt at feeling worthy or beautiful. It’s so messed up how much of our lives we spend criticizing ourselves instead of actually living it. We’re getting there. Slowly but surely. And no matter what weight or habits, you’re right! We are all innately valuable; we are all unique individuals but joined by our shared humanity. ❤️"
spirituality,f4jnv44,t3_dkhc0w,1571622962.0,"Wow. I was just speaking at a conference for my Rotary district in Ontario this weekend and this was a huge focus in my talk as well as the whole theme. There was another speaker who absolutely blew my mind—Paul Chappell from the states who spoke in peace literacy. If you can get your hands on any of his books, I’m only a few chapters into Soldiers of Peace and it is absolutely opening my eyes and soul. The lady that asked me to speak bought me a Rotary pin as a keepsake, it says “Above & Beyond” and explains the story of the bells used by Salvation Army (iffy organization imo but regardless) and the last part says “do you have a cause? If so, find your bell and ring it. Let no one tell you that the problems of the world are too big to tackle, or that one person like you can’t make a difference.” Thank you for sharing, this was my sign to keep the energy going even after the conference has ended and channel it into action and service."
dpdr,eq3vdrp,t3_bx63gu,1559763773.0,"I’m sorry this is hitting at a really inconvenient time, while I’ve learned it is mostly a coping mechanism our brains adapted to protect us, damn it is a real bitch sometimes! I ended up taking this past year off from university after a massive breakdown at the end of last year’s second semester finals, couldn’t eat, leave bed, felt totally dissociated for weeks straight. It is super uncomfortable and I’m not yet well versed in coping with this yet, but I just wanted to remind you that you aren’t alone. Myself and so many others have dealt with similar situations, and I know how scary it can feel sometimes, especially when you have obligations that don’t just cease to exist because you’re experiencing dpdr. Please just remember to take time to care for yourself, whatever that looks like for you. Water sounds so basic but it really helps me feel less groggy and fatigued when I’m getting enough each day. Lately I’ve been trying to have a peppermint tea when I start to feel I may be experiencing dpdr. It’s kind of a grounding technique, I guess. I try to sip it and really enjoy the taste, smelling it and letting myself really experience it. Just a suggestion, I hope it might help a bit. I find trying to keep myself extra organized in stressful times helps, and taking the time to step back and check in with myself. You’ve got this. Please reach out to someone you trust and feel comfortable with in person, or a simple google search can bring up many resources if you feel it becoming too much. You don’t have to go through this alone, as much as it feels like nobody will understand so you’d be better isolating yourself. The light at the end of the tunnel may not always be super visible, but it doesn’t mean it’s not there. ❤️"
