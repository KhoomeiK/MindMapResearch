socialmedia,ff2d1xa,t3_eqy1it,1579501257.0,"There's two reasons why a prospective employee may want to check out your personal profiles. 

1. They want to make sure you're legit, and not someone who's discriminative, posting crude images, violent, etc.... You'd be surprised when you meet someone in person and then see their social profiles. It's almost like seeing a completely different person.
2. They want to see if you're using your own skills to develop yourself as your own brand. I've seen this before and when done correctly, you can look like someone who is well established and knows there stuff... or someone that looks a like a fraud. 

Just my two cents. However, as someone who also stopped posting personally for mental health reasons, this decision is entirely up to you. You've got a right on whether you want to share or not."
