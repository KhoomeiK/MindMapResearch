AvPD,fpghqhc,t3_gd83ke,1588602940.0,"Hey there, I was just wondering the same thing about myself yesterday too. I think the problem most of us share is that we're so used to feeling isolated & unwanted that we feel wildly uncomfortable feeling any other way. I noticed the same thing goes for depression; the moment I start feeling happy because of something new in my life, I immediately want to go back to being miserable because it feels safe. We have this deep seated core belief that absolutely refuses to accept that anything good will last, the risk of this good situation going wrong terrifies us so we want to run away. 

I'm sure you treasure your current friend group and don't want your feelings getting in the way of enjoying your time with them or future relationships. I'd recommend working on your self-esteem because feeling like you *deserve* to have friends, relationships, and other good things in life is absolutely key. It's a difficult goal for sure, but most of us here are fighting for this too. My advice may seem vague, but building self esteem works differently for everyone. And personally, I'm having a hard time getting there too. It's at least somewhat reassuring to me that getting out of this rut is very possible, I wish you the best and I believe in you."

You need constant reassurance from others to do very small tasks and can't function without the input of others.
