Perhaps your Doctor discouraged you in an effort to encourage you? Idk, I would like to think a Doctor of all people would never say a statement like that unless they had good intentions. But, again, I have this disorder and my thoughts are often obscure in nature. Best wishes to you!"

I know your thoughts and feelings are very real to you right now. In order to end your suffering and constant fear, you need to speak with a therapist and start taking medication as prescribed as soon as possible. Try to tell yourself that your feelings are real but the facts behind those feelings are not. I was also molested as a child, I have PTSD, ADHD, Shizophrenia, Depression, and Anxiety. It took awhile but after I found a good med cocktail, I am now able to tell myself that my delusions are not real, I also check in with a therapist regularly. Wishing you the best!"

They all meant something special to me. Now that I am on meds and in therapy, I still see signs but I'm able to tell myself they aren't real. Once in awhile I let my mind wonder into my schizo world and think about what everything means but I am now able to pull myself out of that world and into reality, if that makes sense."
