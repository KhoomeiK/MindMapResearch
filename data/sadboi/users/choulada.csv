I'm actually successful, so I meet a dream character and ask him, ""Hey, why am I having so many nightmares today?"", and he immediately says, ""It's because you're lost"" (my native language is not English, so he wasn't speaking English, but the meaning is basically like ""You lost your way""). I say, ""I don't understand, can you explain?"" but he refuses to tell me anything else. Now I wonder if there was actually some meaning behind it or it was just something random."
Anxiety,fqwsupu,t3_gl6u7j,1589716491.0,"Yes, and I often can't sleep because I keep thinking of cringy stuff I've done years and years ago which probably no one but me remembers about. But what's even worse that sometimes I feel the same way even about stuff that wasn't that cringy at the time. For example, last summer I went to Japan and while I never took Japanese classes before, it just so happened I knew a lot of random words/phrases, plus I looked up some online classes/Youtube videos before the trip to make sure I can say some basic stuff in Japanese in case no one speaks English.    
So, my husband and I were at some sushi place, and a chef there heard me asking for a check in Japanese, so he asked me if I speak Japanese, and to my surprise, my poor Japanese was enough to hold some small conversations (like telling him where I'm from, where I live now, that the guy with me is my husband, discuss weather, etc.). The chef understood me and seemed impressed and at the time I felt it was pretty cool, cause I didn't expect I would actually be able to hold any kind of conversation in Japanese. But now later, as I lay in my bed trying to fall asleep, I keep thinking stuff like, ""Why did I have to try and speak Japanese? My Japanese is probably terrible, did he think I was stupid for even trying? Did he think ""oh no, another weeaboo who thinks they can speak Japanese?"" Oh God, why did I have to do it?"", etc.    
The same also happens with some social outings. I hang out with people, have fun, everything seems great, but later at night it's all like ""Fuuu why did I say/do that? Did they judge me for this? Maybe it was stupid to do/say this and that, after all"", etc. So yeah, I don't even have to do anything too cringy to cringe about it later."
LucidDreaming,fpulybm,t3_gf8ske,1588916481.0,"Most of my lucid dream experiences (at least the ones which don't happen spontaneously but the ones I actively try to achieve) happen this way: I'm in my bed trying to fall asleep, then I imagine a movement like rolling off the bed and then I actually feel it and find myself in my room but already in a lucid dream and can explore from there. But the problem is that I often get this kind of inception-style stuff like when I try doing it and I feel like I actually rolled off the bed and think ""oh wow, I tried so hard I actually rolled off the bed! I better get back into bed and try again"". But what I don't realize is that at this point I AM already in a lucid dream.  

And yesterday I had another interesting experience. I was trying to do the whole ""roll off the bed"" thing but it wasn't working very well. So in my half asleep state I thought ""maybe if I crawl to the very side of the bed and lean over it, then I can imagine falling off the bed easier and it'll work better"". So, I do that - crawl to the side, lean over and bam, I feel falling to the floor and find myself in a lucid dream.  But I think ""Ok, it worked, but it kinda sucks that I fell asleep in this awkward leaning over position, I will probably feel really sore when I wake up""... And I keep thinking about this throughout my whole dream. But when I wake up, I find that I'm actually sleeping in my bed in a normal position, so that whole part with ""crawling to the side of the bed to lucid dream better"" was already happening in a lucid dream without me realizing it!"

Then I suddenly realize it's a dream and I'm like, ""Ok, fuck off, monster, I have stuff to do!"", and monster usually does fuck off and just disappear.

As for if it's possible to change your anatomy, well, theoretically yes, but I never succeeded so far, because I guess it's too hard for my brain to imagine what it would feel like if I was opposite gender, for example.

I had some scary experiences with walking through the mirror though. I remember in the past I had this idea of walking through the mirror in my lucid dream. And I tried several times and either it didn't work or there was a case where it was kind of working and I put my arm through it but I suddenly got so scared.

Hsinchu is basically a city of engineers, working crazy hours, who have no time for anything else but work . There's nice nature around Hsinchu (if you have a car/scooter to get there), but there's not much life in the city. Barely any bars, night clubs, nice restaurants, etc. Meeting people is pretty hard, especially foreigners (don't know of any foreigner communities in here). Not much events, not much cultural life. If you don't speak good Chinese, your only options for your free time are basically: stay at home, go to the mall/Costco (yes, it's considered an entertainment here) or drive out of the city.  And even if you do, not sure you'll have much more options.    

Before I moved here, I was really skeptical of people telling me ""Hsinchu sucks"" and thinking I can still make it work, but after almost three years I feel like it's sucking out all the joy out of me (I know it sounds dramatic, but yeah). But then again, tastes differ, so there are probably people who might still like it in here.

So, yeah, the idea of moving to an entire new country with a new language and culture was really scary at first, but after I visited it several times, I really loved it, and so the idea of moving didn't really scare me that much anymore. And now, three years later I think my life here is amazing and better than it's ever been before. I mean, yes, I'm happy being with the person I love, but I also really love Taiwan and it's super exciting to go to new places, see new things, try new food, etc. all the time. I feel like I'm on a permanent vacation or something!    
Now, there is some degree of ""social isolation"" in the sense that while I am learning Chinese, I'm far from being able to hold a decent conversation in it and I don't know if I'll ever be fluent enough to actually make friends with people who only speak Chinese. Doing everyday stuff can be a challenge sometimes (although it IS possible to get around with only speaking English, especially in big cities). But I've always been introverted, so I actually don't NEED to have social interactions all the time, and when I do, I know quite a few people I can talk to either in English or Russian, so I'm not completely alone or something. Plus wherever I go, I usually have my husband with me, so he can help with communication and doing stuff in Chinese.    
As for missing my country/family, I actually don't miss it as much as I thought I would. I regularly exchange emails with my family and chat with friends back home, so I don't feel too far away from them. Yeah, sometimes I miss some familiar places in my hometown, miss food, and so on, but it's not bad enough to make me permanently depressed or something. Besides, I can still go visit, even if not too often.    
So, yeah, all in all it worked out very well and I can't wait to see what else life has in store for me!"

AskReddit,fhpfceu,t3_f41msx,1581788292.0,"I actually had it happen to me. Back then I was, well, maybe 18-19, not sure, and I was a goth girl but didn't have many friends or anything and didn't consider myself cool at all. One time I was standing at a bus stop and was approached by a teenage girl who was like 13-14 or so and she was super nervous and stuttering and told me something like, ""Hey, I saw you around before and you were wearing this cool black coat and stuff, and you just look really cool, and um, can we be friends and stuff?"" (I don't remember if she actually asked about being friends, maybe she just asked for my number or something). I was kind of weirded out and didn't know how to react, but we still exchanged numbers and then later met a few times, and she even invited me to her home and showed me some yuri pictures (anime girl+girl stuff). I thought that might have been a hint, but not like she tried to make a move on me or anything, besides, as I said, she was like 14, so even though I AM leaning on a bisexual side, of course, I didn't want to pursue that.      
so, yeah, it was all very awkward and at some point we didn't see each other for a while, and my style changed a little, and when we met again I looked less like a goth girl and more like punk or something, and she seemed a little disappointed, and I think in general I just didn't turn out to be who she wanted me to be, so we just lost contact after a while."

LucidDreaming,fhge7uc,t3_f0rcbc,1581564871.0,"Caution, long post ahead!    
So, yesterday I had this lucid dream where I found my dream guide and asked her a question but then woke up just about she was to answer it (I wrote about it in this thread earlier). I still really wanted to know the answer, so this night I hoped to have another lucid dream and try again. That is why I decided to actually try the method I used years ago with quite a lot of success (but later it somehow stopped working). The method was actually for ""out-of-body-experience""but from description it was clear that it's not like you're going to actuall leave your body and go to real places and stuff, but it's still basically a method to achieve lucid dreaming.        
The idea was that you need to wake up at some point before it's your time to get out of bed (they suggested alarm clock for it, but I just normally wake up all the time and then go back to sleep) and then without moving, imagine rolling off the bed (""out of your body"") or floating to the side, or crawling away (but rolling off always worked the best for me).    
Anyway, this morning I woke up to go to toilet, then went to bed and as I felt I'm about to fall asleep, I imagined this ""rolling off"" thing and to my surprise it worked immediately! The only thing is that reality check said I was dreaming, but my husband was like ""Why are you up and walking around?"", so I was doubtful (later I confirmed that I wasn't actually walking around). Because of that I woke up and tried again, and in the end it worked perfectly - I found myself in my apartment with lights off everywhere.  

I immediately proclaim ""I want to see my dream guide!"" and start walking around the apartment looking for them. They're nowhere to find though, so I think maybe they're behind the entrance door. I open it and it's dark outside but I can see a figure in the darkness. I say, ""Damn, you scared me! Come in!"" The figure comes in and this time it's a young guy, pretty good looking. He said his name was Charlie.    
I ask him to turn on the lights and we start chatting, and, of course, I immediately want to ask him the question I wanted to ask last time (about sometimes having bad vision in lucid dreams), so I do, but he doesn't actually tell me anything, just kind of keeps quiet and changes the subject. I don't know what else to say, so eventually I wake up.    
After I woke up, I think well, that was it, I doubt I can go back now. But at some point I hear a weird sound like my electric heater is acting up. I go check on it and the light on it is on (did my husband turn it on?) and the heater looks like it might catch fire or something. I think, ""I better unplug it"", but then I see it is ALREADY unplugged. So, I'm like, ""Waaaaait a minute!"" Now I realize it is a dream. And somehow I thought that maybe Charlie did it to help me come back.  So, I go around the flat looking for him and find him taking a shower in my bathroom. When he sees me, he comes out, but since my vision is still kind of blurry, I don't see anything NSFW. I realize he's not going to answer my questions, so I say, ""How about you teach me to fly? We can fly together maybe?"". He agrees, and we go to the balcony. It feels very real, so I tell him ""Damn, I better do muptiple reality checks before I jump off this balcony"", and he says, ""Yup, you better do!"".    
Anyway, I do reality checks, grab his hand and we jump. BUT instead of flying we just fall down and hit the ground. It doesn't really hurt, but when I stand up I feel like my foot hurts a little. I tell him, ""Welp, that didn't seem to work"", and he says ""Ah, yeah..."" Then I just look at him and I kind of get a little said and say, ""Hey, Charlie... Are you like a real person or do you only exist  here?"" And then I wake up. But I mean, not like I don't know the answer anyway (I don't believe you can meet real people in dreams).    
So, basically TL;DR: I met another dream guide, but he must have been an intern cause he doesn't know shit and doesn't seem very competent. It was still fun to hang out with him though."

I gathered a lot, and so I thought there's a few things I want to try when I have a lucid dream next time. One of them was to try to find my ""dream guide"" and ask them for some advice.  

So, today I had a lucid dream where I was in the house I used to live as a kid. I immediately remembered what I wanted to do, so I said ""I want to meet my dream guide"" and entered the next room (where the entrance to my apartment was). And I was surprised to see an elderly lady with grey hair standing there. There was also my brother there for some reason (I don't live with him anymore, but used to as a kid). So, I greet the lady and confirm that she IS a dream guide. Then I invite her to come to the room with me and sit down. My brother comments something about it and I ask her, ""Wow, can he see you?"" (because it seemed like he couldn't see me), and she said ""ah, yeah"".  

Anyway, once we're in a room she kind of goes on some long-winded story which doesn't make much sense to me and which I can't process well (although maybe I should've been paying more attention). At this point the word gets a little fuzzy and so I decide to get to business, and tell her, ""I'd like to ask you how to make my lucid dreams more clear? In some dreams it feels like I have a black cover over either one or both of my eyes. Do you know how I could get rid of it?'. Then she says, ""Oh yeah, I used to have it in the beginning, too (implying, she's a lucid dreamer, too?). But there's ean asy way to solve it. You just need to...""  

And then I wake up from a fucking phone call! And it wasn't even anyone I know, just some random number, so I ignored it (inb4 it was a dream lady calling). But I was just SO frustrated I wasn't able to finish the conversation and try other stuff I wanted to try! Hopefully, next time it'll work better and no one will interrupt me."

Just a couple of days ago I had a lucid dream in which I was sitting on a window sill in a high building, and I wondered what would happen if I jump. I did multiple reality checks, so technically I was sure it was a dream. But still it felt so real - things looked real, I could feel wind on my face... I even started wondering what if I sleepwalked and now am really sitting on a window ready to jump (this is silly, I know). Anyway, because of how real it was, I never gathered the courage to jump in the end.

Moreover, many places don't even let you in if you don't have a mask. I was considering seeing a doctor again (cause my bronchitis isn't getting much better), but the clinic won't let you in without a mask, which makes sense I guess, but it just means that if you didn't stock up on masks beforehand, you're on your own and no medical help for you (unless it's serious enough to call ambulance).

I work as a translator and specialize in making English subtitles for Russian movies: both big ones and some smaller artsy ones, so I assume they're showing them abroad. I live in Taiwan and sometimes movie theaters here show Russian movies. Not sure if these movies make it to America though (maybe to some film festivals, but not movie theaters in general)."
AmItheAsshole,f9mcs2m,t1_f9ljvcm,1575452163.0,"But it's not just about moaning (it's easy not to moan) or heavy breathing (you can try to cover it up). I'm sorry for details, but the rubbing itself produces sounds especially if it's on a wet surface. I once had my mom masturbate ""quietly"" next to me when I was like 5-6 or so (it's common in my country to sleep in bed with your parents/parent when you're a child), and let me tell you, it was not a pleasant experience and I knew what she was doing even though there weren't obvious moans or anything."
NoStupidQuestions,f9flh0d,t1_f9esg8l,1575277447.0,"No, I haven't experienced any negative effects, and my vision didn't get any worse, even though it's been a few years already and I'm on my laptop all the time. My husband had LASIK (with the same doctor) about 10 years ago, and so did his parents, and neither of them experienced any problems or noticed their vision becoming worse.  
So, I guess, the main thing is to choose the right doctor, and then it's way more likely that the surgery will be successful and with no side effects."
AmItheAsshole,f8rw6ga,t3_e1mvs4,1574756065.0,"NTA, I (Russian) girl married a Taiwanese man and we had two weddings: for our Russian wedding we wore traditional Russian outfits and for our Taiwanese wedding I wore a traditional Chinese dress (qipao/cheongsam).  No one was offended or saw it as something controversial (neither on Russian nor on Taiwanese side). People were actually excited about us delving into each other's cultures and thought it's a super cool idea.  

I feel like people who get offended by this kind of stuff are usually white Americans (and maybe to a lesser degree Europeans) who are just looking for something to be offended about, not the actual representatives of the cultures which are being ""appropriated"" (not to mention that in this particular case it doesn't even qualify as ""appropriation"")."

AskReddit,f7gxolv,t3_dw1qb6,1573723177.0,"When I was a kid, my parents didn't want to lie to me about Santa Claus but they also didn't want to admit that they're the ones leaving the presents under the Christmas tree, so they came up with something in the middle: they claimed that Santa Claus is a man who has a job of sneaking into people's houses and leaving presents under their trees. They would even sometimes leave a window half-open saying ""Oh, that's how he sneaked in this time!"" (and we didn't even live on the first floor, so he'd have to have some climbing skills). Somehow I never questioned it and only as I was getting older, I was like ""Wait a minute, there's way too many things wrong with it""."
TooAfraidToAsk,f7dtlxi,t3_dvdp9c,1573629367.0,"Those ""judgemental stares"" are probably just in your head. You THINK people would judge you for having sex at 20 and so you see what you want to see. I mean, when I was younger I also always thought people ""looked at me judgmentally"" for the smallest things, but as I grew older, I realized people don't actually care that much about other people and what you perceive as ""judgmental glances"" is probably just them casually glancing over you and then forgetting about it a second after."
AskReddit,f6wnlaa,t3_dtecdy,1573230688.0,"When I was a teenager I needed to go to a doctor to pick up some document (I don't really remember what it was) but being a lazy teenager I didn't go when I was supposed to. So, my mom asked me if I went and I said, ""Um, I went but... um... the doctor is on vacation"". Later that day my mom comes into my room and goes, ""So, I called the clinic..."", and I'm already thinking ""SHIT"", and then she continues, ""And seems like you were telling the truth, after all. The doctor is indeed on vacation."" I still can't believe this really happened."
childfree,f6w41x0,t1_f6vsmzn,1573215593.0,"Well, they could use it as an argument when talking to other childfree people later: ""Hey, I met this old woman and asked her if she regretted not having kids and SHE SAID SHE DID, so you should have kids like right now!"" Although even if she says she doesn't regret, they're going to say something like ""Well, I met this old woman and she said she didn't regret having children but I could see that she was miserable and was just putting on a good face, so you should have kids like right now anyway""."
childfree,f6lshph,t3_drumz9,1572959510.0,"Our Chinese teacher recently had a baby and she seemed pretty excited about it, so when in class we were practicing the way of saying ""to be someone/become someone"" in Chinese and she asked us ""Do you want to become a mom or a dad?"", I got very nervous thinking that if I say no, she'll keep asking why and trying to convince me to have a baby. I don't know what others were thinking but somehow everyone was hesitant to respond, so she went ahead and said ""I don't want to be a mom"" and then later added ""My baby is cute and I love him but I don't want/like to be a mom."" She also said that she can't go to many places, doesn't sleep much and she wants to be successful professionally, not just be a mom. Don't know why she even had a baby, maybe she was pressured into it by her husband, but it's not like we're close enough that I could ask.      
Anyway, after what she said, she asked us the question again and I said ""I don't want to be a mom"". Then she asked, ""What about your husband?"", I said ""He doesn't want to be a dad either"", and she said ""Okay"" and moved on (damn, I wish everyone reacted like this to me saying I don't want to be a mom). But then till the end of the class she kept muttering to herself ""I don't want to be a mom..."" in Chinese. It was kind of surprising for me she was that open with her students about it, but also refreshing, I guess."
