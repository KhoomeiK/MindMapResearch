Managed to kick several other addictions but weed is always the constant and quarantine really hasn’t helped. Hope you find something that helps you.

mentalhealth,flg8flh,t3_folchz,1585134811.0,"Depends where you are. Getting a diagnosis can be a long process, and sometimes very draining. I’ve had several potential diagnoses floating around throughout my life, so I did a lot of my own research on my symptoms whilst I was under my local mental health team, told my psychiatrist what diagnosis I thought fit, they explored that with me over a couple of sessions and then the diagnosis stuck. Because my country’s mental health treatment is pretty much as useful as not having anything at all, I had to become an expert in myself really. I just took the time whilst waiting for treatment to really understand myself, what my triggers are, coming to terms with my traumas, evaluating my relationships and my own destructive behaviours and where these have come from. It’s a lot of energy, but I found the more self aware and more knowledgeable I became of my own condition and brain, the more it helped professionals reach a conclusion as well. 

I also think it’s important to know what you want out of a diagnosis and discovering how helpful it actually is in getting you to a place of treatment and recovery. I’ve now gone private for therapy, with someone who specialises in my condition but she didn’t diagnose me, and it has been the most useful thing then anything I’ve received in my 12 years of being in the system. My diagnosis has sort of become irrelevant in my treatment as it’s just a label that coincidentally encompasses a lot of the things I deal with on a daily basis. What’s more important to me is that she validates my feelings and emotions. She understands and makes sense of why I am the way I am and what I do and looks at every aspect of my birth, upbringing, adolescence and adulthood and the events within this that have led to me to how I feel today.

I feel it’s really valuable to try connect with your mind, look at yourself and your life and what’s happened, rather than focusing on the symptoms you’re feeling, as when you get to the root causes of why you feel and behave this way, can you start to see what changes are needed to make things easier, even if it’s just little steps to begin with. Write everything down. Write down or draw those hard moments of your life that really stick out in your head, it’s a great way of exploring and visualising yourself, you’ll get those little lightbulb moments “Oh! That’s why I do that!” and it really helps bring some relief. 

I know not everyone has the means to access private therapy but if you do a bit of research some people might offer lower prices in your area hopefully. Or access through your school/work. I hope that makes sense and I wish you all the best in this battle, I know how hard it can be."

Sonsofanarchy,fk3dqjn,t1_fk38yxe,1583828482.0,"Thanks for this dude yeah completely agree, it doesn’t make sense! Said in another comment surely Unser would have been enough of a witness to all that for Jax to be able to call a Mayhem vote? The decision to keep Clay alive for Irish sake comes after this doesn’t it after Gemma gives Jax the letters? He could have easily let Opie kill Clay and then subsequent episodes could have dealt with the Irish fallout. Still would have had a similar outcome to what S5 eventually leads too anyway. 

Yep, such a shame how much the writing quality dropped, don’t even get me started on what they did with Tara’s character... the only tolerable woman character for me by the end of it is Wendy"
Sonsofanarchy,fk3dirw,t1_fk2o6am,1583828181.0,"Yeah, I thought Jax made the “keeping Clay alive to keep Galen happy” decision after Gemma had given him them the letters which is the next episode isn’t it? Wouldn’t Unser being a witness to all of it be enough proof for a Mayhem vote for Jax? I feel like S4 is where we really begin to question everyone’s loyalties..."
Sonsofanarchy,fk28lwa,t1_fk28hlw,1583795486.0,Yeah it was and I guess it would have ended the whole show early but I just feel so bad for Opie and that scene where Jax says “don’t make me shoot you” to Ope kills me. Think there’s so many ways it could have turned out
