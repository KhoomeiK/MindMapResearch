If the sidewalks are bumpy and you're moving with a short board you'll feel the vibration very strongly and your legs will feel like shit after a little while. Also depends on what wheels you have but the length of the board will help way more.

That was based only on my experience. You should research and maybe get advice from professionals. You should also check out [longboard buyers guide](https://www.muirskate.com/longboard-guide/)"
