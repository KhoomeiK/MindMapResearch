Drugs,fbsgs0f,t1_fbsgfrg,1577055007.0,"Pychosis is a syndrome or group of symptoms. Someone experiencing an episode of psychosis is having a ‘break’ with reality. Major symptoms of psychosis are hallucinations and delusions. Hallucinations are sensations that are not real, such as hearing voices or sounds that aren’t real. Hearing voices is a common hallucination, but hallucinations can be experiences with any sense—hearing, sight, smell, taste, or touch."

Drugs,fbsfnxa,t1_fbsffqj,1577054584.0,Some people just dont feel it as much especially if your thinking if you keep smoking weed has been leading you towards being schizophrenic. It probably just takes more than the average dose to get your brain to relax.
