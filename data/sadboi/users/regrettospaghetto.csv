Try not to focus or talk about nutritional facts (eg. CALORIES) or her weight or look. I've been told ""you dont look like you have anorexia"" and ""youve lost so much weight, you look good!"" & i can tell you with confidence BOTH are just as fueling. Instead of ""you look good in those jeans"" for example, ""you look confident"". 

Try to distract your friend if you had a meal. She'll probably want to purge but even if it is 5 minutes of not purging, it almost rewires? As in, it makes it seem less *needed* than if you do it immediately.

Of course, 100%, tell your friend youre worried for her. Knowing people care is comforting & makes you feel cared & loved. Mention how you feel & your concerns. Without saying things like ""you look good right now"", because maybe she will like that but you dont want to risk triggering her accidentally. Even small things like suggesting or looking for help for her, or asking her if she has had water & medication or maybe food. 

We are a lot to handle. Youre a very good friend for looking for help & its different getting advice from doctors than from people going through it. They know medicine but we know emotion. If you have questions or need someone, im always here!!‚ô°‚ô°"
