Anxiety,fkwvv7t,t1_fkstvmy,1584608125.0,"I used to smoke everyday for 6-7 years and now I‚Äôm scared to even try it again. I used to love smoking. It‚Äôs not just you. It is scientifically proven that weed causes anxiety. I went to the doctor for my anxiety and the first thing he asked me was if I smoked. It never used to make me anxious like you said, it just switched. One of the best ways to relieve anxiety is to quit any form of smoking. Ever since I quit, I feel much better and healthier."

lakers,fibxide,t3_f7bml3,1582332474.0,"They will most likely resign him next season. He wasn‚Äôt going to play this season and he‚Äôll be fresh for the next season. It‚Äôs much better than waiving someone who actually played. Cousins understands this too, it‚Äôs a business. Markieff and Morris are basically the same player that  have some different strengths. They are both great 3 point shooters. I‚Äôm happy with the pickup and also glad that they didn‚Äôt trade any of the guys who put in work this season because everyone contributed in some way."

lakers,fh0jkki,t1_fh0hupn,1581204577.0,I read it. It makes no sense for the Knicks to ask for green and kuzma then later ask for Bradley and cousins???  It also mentioned a second round pick which the Lakers do not have.
lakers,fh0ijxv,t3_f0s1ka,1581204198.0,"I don‚Äôt think so. The Knicks are such a trash organization, they were asking for way too much. The clippers just wanted to him to fuck with us. I doubt that the counter deal ever happened. I‚Äôll see and check it out but it‚Äôs not likely"
lakers,fh0hesu,t1_fgzwz1b,1581203918.0,"Never heard that. They wanted green and kuz AND a pick for Morris. That is too steep, The Knicks never wanted to do deal with the Lakers. You could tell, it‚Äôs so obvious. The Mavs wanted Green and was willing to include a pick to get him. Why would they offer boogie if he might not even play this season?

If the price is right, I think it might be a good fit but to me it‚Äôs a gamble with a high risk with little reward. Come playoff time, you should expect LeBron to play most minutes anyway. Obviously if LeBron sits the team isn‚Äôt gonna look as great. DC could still be on the table as well. Time will tell but I think I remember hearing that rose wants to play on the East coast."
