The best thing that you can do right now is take care of yourself; do things that make you happy, talk to friends and family that you get along with and understand you well. Try some journaling and meditation, it is advice that is thrown around a lot, but it really does work. Finally, be patient with yourself. One of my guided mindfulness exercises states that we are not emotions, and they do not define us, and that they will pass. I hope some of this helps."

For the last six years of our marriage I was miserable, and had contemplated divorce myself. I've moved back to where I have the support of my family and friends and a locale where I can find a job in my field. When I tell people I'm divorced the reaction is usually the same, ""oh I'm sorry"".  I always say thank you, and follow up with dont be, I'm much happier now.

My divorce process started last November, and was just finalized a few weeks ago. During that time I have had a lot of time to reflect, and I do agree that we are responsible for how we respond to our triggers, and admittedly, I did not always respond well. There were some sore spots that were touched a lot, and I did my best to calmly respond to my ex, and tried to tell her to please stop, and she didn't seem to understand. Since November, I have thought a lot about the mistakes I have made, and although I have yet to be in a new relationship, I have confidence in myself that I won't make the same mistakes again. I have been working with a new therapist since October, and that has helped tremendously as well. 
One thing my attorney said to me in the beginning of all of this, which I firmly believe, is to think of divorce as a healing process. We all have been hurt, and while there is the loss of a relationship to mourn, it is also a time to heal. 
I apologize for the long response, but again, thank you for challenging me. I hope things get better for you, and I hope you also begin to heal soon too."
Divorce,exmkg8l,t3_ctlaq4,1566433824.0,"So first off, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! Secondly, don't take things like those to heart. I do actually have mental health problems (anxiety and depression) and I know that they caused problems in the marriage, but I also wanted to go to marriage counseling to fix our marriage, and have her attend some of my personal counseling sessions to better understand what I deal with. When she did things that triggered me, it was my fault, not hers. Ironically (or not) I have made major strides in my recovery since I have been away from her, and have been much happier. She always told me I needed to do this or that, all the suggestions I had were crap. Long story short, it sounds like you are better off, and I don't think someone will have to ""deal"" with you, rather I'm sure, when you're ready, you and someone else will find lots of happiness together."

dating_advice,exle3de,t3_ctghwl,1566411240.0,"I don't work in a field where I am in activism, but in many cases our careers give us a certain definition, including yours, and so does mine (I'm a college professor, which requires a lot of at home work). Like some other commenters have said, you should be proud of what you do. Secondly, I think the whole point of a date is to learn about one another, and a person's career is a major part of their life. If what you do is distasteful to your date, then you're probably not compatible. 
As for family, admittedly not all people in older generations are opposed to women's rights or abortion. With that being said, finding a good family match can be a good thing. I am recently divorced, and one of the things that eroded my relationship with my ex wife was the fact that my ex in-laws didn't get along with me. So when you talk about your career is up to you, but you and your SO have to find a balance if his parents don't accept what you do. 
Sorry for the long response, but I don't think you should change or hide what you do, I think you should be proud of it. Just don't make the same mistake I made, if there's family issues, be careful!"

The recommendation to work out while listening to an audiobook may be useful though. My grandmother died during my divorce process, and I drive a lot to pick up my kids. I listened to audiobooks in the car instead of my usual playlist, and it helped a lot. Early on, for me, reading, watching TV, didn't help.

It's even more so odd as she is the one who initiated the divorce. It's not an easy process, and there's a lot of odd emotions attached to it. The best thing to do, in my opinion, is to keep talking to people about it. It's better to let it out than to keep it in. I hope this helped a little."

I'm sorry to hear that things didn't work out with the woman you met, as divorce can make you feel lonely.

First and foremost, speak with your professors on day one about your situation, that you are an adult learner who is holding down a job and has anxiety. It is much easier for us to help someone when we know what you are dealing with, and before you have failed an assignment or exam, than after the fact. On that note, if you are given an assignment, or are preparing for an exam, and find yourself lost, get help ASAP! I have had students get help early in the semester and go from a D to a B+, and others get help late and see little improvement. Take advantage of any services your institution may offer, such as tutoring and counseling. I am the same way, if I am not interested in a subject, I find it hard to focus, but with a little bit of help, you may find success within your reach. Also, although you may already be in counseling, student counseling services often focus on student specifc issues, and may be able to help you further. 
I hope this helps, a good luck in the upcoming semester."

I was angry, and had a lot of things to say, but knew I couldn't say them. Even though the divorce process began last November, and just finished a few weeks ago, I believe I wrote a letter over the past few weeks. I have a journaling app that I use, and although they are saved, I tend to write them and forget about them. It is therapeutic though. 
You have been through a lot, and I hope you find relief. Talking to friends and family, meditation, and seeking out a therapist (if needed) are all positive things to do. I hope things improve for you soon."

I suffer from anxiety and depression, and was (unexpectedly) served with divorce papers last November. It took several weeks, if not months, to get over it. Fortunately I was, and still am, in the care of an excellent therapist. When I finally thought I was getting on top of things and feeling good again, my grandmother, whom I was very close with, passed away unexpectedly. Then my mind was trying to mourn two losses: the loss of my marriage and the loss of my grandmother. After that I had the court date in early May to settle the divorce, and although I had accepted the fact that I was getting divorced, I didn't realize until nearly a month after that court date how it was effecting my mood, the fact that I was single and in a way, alone. I have had the support of my family and friends, but it is different when you don't have the support of a the significant other you have had for over a decade (together for a total of 15 years, married for 10). 
You deserve a lot of credit for opening up the way you have, it takes a lot to be able to be so open, although I have found that through talking have found some strength and peace. If you ever want to message me, feel free."

Even though I was having fun with my kid, it was so hard seeing all of these ""complete"" people, where I feel like I have failed.

Divorce,exhetnf,t3_cswhrt,1566303129.0,"Some good points have already been raised, but there was something I wanted to ask. You mentioned that you had cheated on your husband with 5 or 6 guys, and then  later mentioned that your husband didn't want to go to counseling, and was a bit of a homebody. Have you considered that there may be some emotional dissatisfaction, or problems, in your marriage? This was a big problem in my marriage, and while divorce, and getting over the loss of a relationship, is a process, I have done a lot of healing and grown a lot as a person since this process has begun. While I am not saying or implying that this is a problem you are having, it is something that you may want to consider or contemplate. 
As for having kids post divorce and already being 35, yes the risk of birth defects does go up. However, genetic testing is usually standard at and after age 35, and if you have any questions before or after, you can always consult a generic counselor. Just because the risk goes up does not mean you will have a problem. 
I hope all of that helped."

I'm not going to get into details on the specifics of my depression, but I also don't want to hide anything from anyone. I don't expect anyone to fix me, as working through my depression is the responsibility of myself and my therapist. However, I do feel that someone that I could potentially be in a relationship with has a right to know that they're getting into, and if they're not up for it, I don't want them to find out later on. It's not that my depression isn't well under control, but certain things can be harder for me than a neurotypical person. 
In your case I think it's good that you're going to try and bring it up. While openness about depression can be helpful in a relationship, and be a recipe for success, if it's hidden or untreated, it could be a disaster. I hope everything goes well."

I know that it can be hard to do at a game, but when you get the chance, I recommend doing things like journaling, mindfulness and meditation exercises. Another thing that can be helpful is writing letters to your ex, a letter that is never going to be read by him, but something that you can write out where you say everything you want to say to him. What you do with it when your done is up to you. I did this a lot in the beginning and it was very helpful.

I have also been suicidal, and understand how much work it takes to dig myself out from that deep, dark hole. It will get better. 
With all of that being said, it takes support and understanding from someone close to help, and it doesn't seem like you have someone who understands or supports you. Try to contact friends or family who are understanding of your situation and will also understand why you are considering splitting up from your husband. If you choose to do this, you will need a lot of support. Keep your chin up as best you can. It is better to split from the wrong person than to stay with them.

My University offered student counseling services and this was very helpful as it helped me get through the anxiety of finishing my degree, as well as some of the other things that were going in in my life at the time. If your University offers these services I would recommend seeking these out as the counselors there are accustomed the the pressures that students face. You may want to consider telling your supervisor and research advisor, but I ask that you proceed with caution (not to add to your anxiety but) some academics do not take to this news well, and see it as a sign of weakness.  I trust that you know them well, and can make a wise judgement call. Please know that anxiety IS NOT a sign of weakness! If you tell them and it doesn't go over well, consider telling a department chair or Dean. 
As for things to do in the meanwhile, try to split things up into small, easy to conquer tasks. This will help your brain see that you can manage to get some things done, and give you a sense of accomplishment when you complete those tasks. Eat well, and try to rest. Make sure you pace yourself when you are working, and if possible, try to get out into nature. 
From  former grad student who made it through to someone who is in the trenches, it is possible. It is anxiety inducing, but you will make it. Best of luck, and if you need more advice or have questions, dm me."
Divorce,es7koxa,t3_c6anhe,1561673009.0,"I am so happy for you in your post-divorce journey, and you tell your story so well! It is so uplifting for a situation that is so difficult. I am a little over six months into my divorce, which is nearly finalized, and it was sudden. My ex and I have remained in contact and are friendly (we have two kids together, and are doing this partially as a benefit for them), but I don't really speak to her family anymore. However, my friends have swopped in to help support me, and I have gotten closer to my family as well. I am considering going back to school, even though I already have an advanced degree, because it will set me up for a career that will align more with my interest and give my kids a more secure future. I hope that your future continues to shine brightly!"
Divorce,es7i6o2,t3_c67jjl,1561671349.0,"Reading this gives me so much hope. I have been making a lot of progress in moving on, but each day is different, and lately there have been a lot of tough days. Hearing you acknowledge that someone will always hold a place in your heart, but it doesn't always have to be the center, really hits the nail on the head and I think will help a lot. Thanks OP!"
Divorce,ertocpb,t3_c3vfc8,1561248294.0,"It is so hard in the beginning, and especially when you see memories like this you will cry. Let it out and don't hold it back. Sometimes you will cry too just because. It's still early, and you need to take things day by day. Eventually it will get better. It takes different lengths of time for different people, but eventually it will get better. Just like everything else in life, this is a journey. Don't go it alone. Talk to family and friends, and a therapist is a good idea too. Now is the time for support."
Divorce,erpxmb4,t1_erpvqda,1561130418.0,"Your response to my reply is at the very least fair, as I had indeed mentioned that my mental health was part of the reason for the dissolution of the marriage, but not the whole reason. There was a breakdown of communication in the relationship, and some of that did have to do with my mental health, some of it I think had to do with the differences in how we were both raised. There were lots of arguments, many of them nasty. I knew that there were a lot of problems in the relationship though, and begged for marriage counseling, to which she said no. I tried very hard to make the relationship work, and put a lot of effort into the family as far as child care and household maintenance went. Frankly, I don't think we treated each other well in the end, and it was a lack of understanding how each person had changed over the years, however she didn't make an effort to understand what I was going through either. 
I can understand how you have seen a lot of these cases, however each situation is different. In the several months that we have been apart, I have had a lot of time to reflect on what I did wrong in the relationship, and for those things I don't blame my ex, in fact we have a good relationship and I have apologized to her for what I have done to hurt the marriage. However, since we have been apart, I have also been much happier, which I believe indicates that the relationship had turned toxic. So again, it was a two way street. 
As I said, she didn't leave me specifically for the mental health, but it was a contributing factor. We are both at fault for the loss of the marriage. That doesn't mean I haven't reflected on my mistakes so that I don't repeat them again though."
Divorce,erohb4c,t3_c331p2,1561078982.0,"Mental health is hard, but the vows are in sickness and in health, and that includes mental health. My ex left me partially because of my mental health. You don't deserve this treatment, and your ex should have worked with you in counseling to try and understand what you were going through. I am so sorry that you are going through all of this."
Divorce,erock4o,t3_c2w5o0,1561075304.0,"Being in a relationship with mental health problems is extremely difficult, and I agree with other commenters that you have been gaslighted by your ex. In my relationship, my ex made no effort to understand my anxiety or depression, and it caused a rift in our relationship. I wanted marriage counseling, but she didn't. Also, being the child of divorce, I know how important it is for parents to be on the same page with discipline, and it sounds like he went overboard with it without your consent. You need to leave and focus on yourself. I know first-hand that things like anxiety and depression do not just ""go away"", but can get better with counseling. Likewise there are people out there who are understanding of these conditions, but I think you need to focus on you first. I have been able to do this since I have been away from my ex, and I am so much happier. When I find someone else, I want to be able to share my life, and not be co-dependent, but have a sharing relationship. I hope this helps."
Divorce,erjx2b4,t1_erjjcsy,1560949564.0,"I can definitely feel you in fear for the new future, divorce brings up a lot of uncertainties. Although it sounds cliche, it does help, which is to take it one day at a time. I know I can overwhelm myself if I try to think of all of the ""tomorrow"" possibilities. However, I have really been able to reinvent myself post-divorce, partially because I had to, and mostly because I wanted to make myself a better person because I wasn't happy with who I was for the past six years. I'm happy the journaling gives you clarity, reading the notes can really be helpful. I hope that as time goes things get better, it is scary but there are lots of possibilities too."
Divorce,erg0xts,t3_c1qtay,1560823286.0,"I definitely agree. I used to hold things in, especially around my ex, she came from an emotionally repressed family and had trouble dealing with emotions herself, and now I am able to bring them up and process them when they come, even if it does mean letting the tears flow. I really appreciate your kind words, and hearing that it does get better, even if the tears still break through."
Divorce,erg0qjg,t1_erfw1mr,1560823127.0,"I definitely find myself doing the ""what it's"" periodically, and its something that I talk with my therapist about. Although I've come to the conclusion that I'm better off without her I still periodically fall into the ""what if"" trap, but I think being somewhat early in the game it's probably only natural. My work keeps me pretty distracted, and I am trying to find other things. I really appreciate the advice from someone who has moved further along, and I'm happy to hear you're doing better."
Divorce,erfdcta,t1_erfcgec,1560805680.0,"I can definitely say that I think I cried the hardest with this in the beginning than I did with anything else.

Divorce,erfd6zl,t1_erf8ec4,1560805570.0,"Thank you so much. Sometimes I feel.the exact same way. The first time I had my kids visit, it honestly hurt because I felt like my family was ""incomplete"" I'm just now starting to get over that feeling and realize that I don't need my STBXW to have a complete family. I also miss having someone in my corner, sometimes the loneliness is tough. 
Thanks so much for the quote, it is awesome. I wish you the best too, it is rough, but we'll all get through it!"
Divorce,erfcyjw,t1_erf1jbw,1560805414.0,"You're very welcome. It may have been indeed by accident, but I have found that not being alone with all of this has really helped me out. My STBXW and I co-parent pretty well, but when it comes to mental health she is culeless and would prefer to ignore it. This is a big reason for our divorce, as I do have an an anxiety disorder and depression, however both have gotten a lot better since I've been away from her.  I'm also in my mid-30's (36) and never thought I'd be ""re-inventing"" myself, but I've come to embrace it. I hope your STBXH can get things under control, at least for the sake of the kids. If you ever need anything, feel free to dm me."

Divorce,erezt87,t1_ereyhsm,1560796685.0,Thank you. I am feeling a bit better today. I am also worried about my kids; I know at first they were both acting out a bit and unfortunately my STBXW is the type of person to stick her head in the sand about things. The best we can do on that front is to be vigilant and advocate for them and be sure to get them the services they need.
Divorce,erextrd,t1_erewz1o,1560795364.0,Totally. One of the hardest things is missing the kids.
Divorce,erexq4v,t1_erex28p,1560795298.0,"I agree. In the end I think I am also better off, and I definitely try to project a strong persona. I know I often feel better after the tears are done, we do all need it sometimes. 🙂"
Divorce,ere4r2v,t1_erdebmw,1560773495.0,"I think it definitely stings no matter what. I was forced by my ex to move back in with my parents prior to being served with papers since she thought I needed a break from everything as I was recovering from a mental health crisis (I have anxiety and depression). At the same time that she was telling me that I was going to move back home she was actually preparing for the divorce. However, I had no friends in the area I was living in with my ex and no family, and the support I have here is great. I was also able to find a job in my field for the first time in six years, which was awesome. 
This definitely brings about a lot of change, but I feel like I have grown a lot too, and been more of myself in the past six years than I have been. The sting is awful, but as it passes, and it will, things will get so much better."
Divorce,erd2srr,t3_c1eo71,1560729201.0,"It hurts so much at first, and admittedly even when it gets better, there will still be up days and down days. But do things for you, improve for you. I feel more like myself than I have in six years. I have reunited with my friends, and I am closer to my family than I have been in a long time. Talk to your friends and family, they will support you and prop you up when it is hard to remember that you are number one, because even though I don't know you, you are awesome and worthy! Also, consider seeing a therapist. My therapist has been awesome in helping me process everything."

Divorce,ercekig,t3_c1cgcl,1560710061.0,"I also suffer from anxiety and depression, and they were one of the reasons behind my divorce (she couldn't/didn't want to learn about them and try to handle them). I was kicked out of the house in September after being in the hospital for a week and now live with my parents, and was served with papers in mid-Novemver. I cried for at least a month, and wasn't myself for a while. I work part-time as an adjunct professor, which keeps me busy full time. Neither my ex nor I have attempted dating yet, but I think I'm about ready to do so. In addition to counseling, I would also try to talk to friends and family, and if possible, seek out friends who have been through this before, they can really help.

Every day is different, and some days are better than others. I am about 8 months in and overall things are improving, but I do worry about being alone/lonely, and just like everything else, some days are better than others and on this topic.

Divorce,eral1ja,t3_c11ffw,1560646817.0,"I tried and tried as well, I kept on saying we needed to communicate, we needed to be more emotionally intimate, and that we needed to go to marriage counseling. It all fell on deaf ears. It ended up being that she initiated the divorce because she couldn't handle my migraines, anxiety or depression, although that was something that I wanted to work on together. If you're not sure what you want to do yet, I would recommend continuing to work with your counselor, and also trying to work with your wife if possible, and seeing if she's amenable to marriage counseling.

It is also true of divorce, which is probably one of the most painful rejections someone can go through. I have to admit though that post-divorce, I have done some reflecting and realized that there are some things that I did in the relationship that I could have done differently, or probably just shouldn't have done. However, I did want to work on them with her, and I view it as I will find someone else to be more compatible with, who I will build a better relationship with, as my ex was never that willing to openly communicate."
Divorce,er9s0pb,t1_er9pwd9,1560628835.0,"I'm sorry you're dealing with such a spiteful ex, I am fortunate in that my ex and I are getting along fairly well, but she was backhanded in how she told me she wanted the divorce, telling me everything was fine and great and then just having me served with papers. I know that she has always been easily influenced by other people, and ever since we moved near her parents, she changed and fell under their spell, and further away from me. I don't want to be with someone who can't be their own own person. She was mad when she found out I sold me wedding band, but I'm not sure what she expected me to do. 
I hope things get better for you soon, co-parenting is so important and no one needs the extra anxiety anyway."

I think in one way or another, everyone finds a balance on their own timeline and in their own way, but it is such a grueling process and no one should do it alone, so I do hope you have the support of family and friends.

Divorce,er76mrz,t3_c0qvut,1560568710.0,"I had known that my ex and I were having communication problems for years, and had been asking for marriage counseling, but she always said no. It finally came to a head this year when I had a nervous breakdown in September, and had to be admitted to the hospital. Even before I was discharged, she was talking about me staying with my parents for a while, and the potential for divorce. I begged her to try and work things through, and she said yes, but that she needed time and space. A month and a half later I was served with papers, after she told me I would be moving back in, and when I asked her about it, she simply told me, ""I don't want to be us anymore."" I was devistated, not only because I had been lied to, but because I was so hopeful for our future. But I was also angry, and while anger can be toxic, it did motivate me to realize me that while I thought there was hope for us, she did not. It helped me to move on, and do some important things, for me, and me alone, which were:
1. Seek the solace of my family and friends. Since I had been married my relationships with my family and friends had suffered. Now that I am single again they are flourishing, and without their support I would not be doing as well as I am today. Seek out your supports, they will listen and help you in your time of need, if not seek out people who will. 
2. Consider seeing a therapist. I did already have a therapist pre-divorce, however the work I have been doing with my therapist has been amazing, and again I wouldn't be where I am today without her help. This is a difficult and upending process, and there is no shame or stigma in seeking the advice or counsel of a mental health professional. 
3. Remember how important you are, and how special you are. Your STBX may be degrading you, and the process itself is degrading, but you are important, and you mean a lot to many people. Never forget your self worth. 
I know that's a long comment, so I apologize for the length, but I hope it helps!"

I wouldn't wait around forever, however being someone who can be socially awkward and anxious myself, I have no doubt I've given off mixed signals in the past.

One thing that gets me is the the whole,""in sickness and in health"" part of our vows, because she divorced me because of my illness (chronic migraine). She ignores physical and mental health issues with our children, and they are not happy with her. She has little clue how to run a household, because all of these things were always done for her, either by her parents, or myself, and it is now a hard lesson.

It's taken a while, but I am slowly moving on and starting to feel like I can potentially date other people. If you can, I would recommend therapy, as well as journaling.
