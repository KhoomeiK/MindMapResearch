You can look at my post history if you want to see more, but I also want to mention I think being in that kind of pain almost all the time tends to drive you to look for some justification of why you feel that way, and since you know there isn't really anything external causing it, the ""logical"" conclusion is that it's your fault somehow. That if you were a better person, worked harder, etc etc you would feel okay or good, but since you don't that's proof you're terrible and bad."

I did mention it after he confirmed the diagnosis and he was just like ""yeah, that's a product of your hyper mind not being able to calm down"".

The dumbest part is I think I came off as trying to play down rather than play up the severity, possibly because of the slight ASD aspect, I couldn't just answer most of the questions with the one word on the scale. Like when asked if I had difficulty finishing projects I was like ""Is this a project just for me or like a job? Because if it's a job for someone else I'll power through and finish but if it's just me yeah I have a lot of things on the go, you know, like *rambles on about several specific things* but I *intend* to finish them, I just have something else I'm working on right now.""

The only point you have is that you're right, what I linked isn't a study, I forgot the term for meta-analysis or whatever the right word is. And I read over what I could access for free of Brotto's work, and it hardly supports your opinion. The only thing I could find that even edged up to it was in [this study from 2010](https://med-fom-brotto.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2017/04/2010-Brotto-et-al.-Asexuality-mixed-methods.pdf):

>It may be possible that one subgroup of asexuals represents those at the low polar end of the sexual desire spectrum, and that encouraging them to deliberately anticipate sexual activity may bring them above the threshold to a point where the distress prompts them to seek attention. The border between HSDD and asexuality is unclear. However, it is possible that the woman with lifelong lack of sexual attractions and interests and who is unbothered by her sexual status may better fit the asexuality label, whereas the woman initially labeled as asexual who, after declaring distress linked with her lack of interests, and also experiences sexual attractions, better fits the sexual dysfunction category of HSDD, and might therefore seek appropriate treatment.

Which, I mean, if you're trying to argue that there's a whole bunch of women who ""should"" be getting treated for HSDD but instead are using the asexual label, there's nothing I've found to suggest that. Meanwhile, the DSM-5 changing the definitions of Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder or Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder to explicitly exclude asexuals, possibly based on recommendations by an AVEN DSM Task Force that prepared a 75-page document which included interviews on seven academics with expertise in human sexuality, which concluded that the DSM-5 should explicitly exclude asexual individuals from receiving a diagnosis of HSDD. Unfortunately I can't find the report, but is [referenced by the good academic Brotto](https://med-fom-brotto.sites.olt.ubc.ca/files/2014/12/Brotto-2010-Hypoactive-desire-in-men-criteria-2482.pdf). At any rate, the change would suggest (along with countless anecdotal experiences) that asexuals are far more likely to be unnecessarily diagnosed than the other way around."
LoveNikki,fk3oqwu,t3_fgcasa,1583841933.0,"Haha I guessed it was a lazy translation but I'll take the rep. Personally I just get a little chuckle from the name and hair colour—if only the leather was black and grey, not brown."
AsexualMen,fk3efys,t1_fk3aj1p,1583829479.0,"You really are reading too much into it, not to mention regurgitating every comment section ever when there's an article about asexual people in relationships. I don't think any sex-averse asexual would want to get into that kind of relationship with an asexual—in my experience it seems that situation only happens when the person just isn't aware that they are ace because they're told ""you just haven't found the right person yet!"" and so force themselves to be sexual until they just can't anymore, but by then there's messy romantic bonds. 

I guess there's also the cases where someone was upfront about being asexual and not wanting to have sex but their allo partner thought they'd change their mind, in which case I think it's gross to put it on the ace for ""denying"" their partner sex when they were very clear from the beginning.

Anyway, I say it's difficult because of the huge gender disparity in numbers of self-reported asexuals. To wit:

**2015 Asexual Census (n=8635)**

Man/male: 12.3%  
Woman/female: 56.8%  
Not listed\*: 30.9%

**2016 Asexual Census (n=9294)**

Man/male: 10.9%  
Woman/female: 63%  
Not listed\*: 26%

\*The not listed category comprises mostly of nonbinary identities which were broken down in the next question

There's even a study based around the survey, [Gender Discrepancy in Asexual Identity: The Effect of Hegemonic Gender Norms on Asexual Identification](https://cedar.wwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1081&context=wwu_honors), which posits likely explanations for the huge difference in numbers. 

But at any rate, even if that difference is solely due to gender norms and whatnot, it doesn't change that heteroromantic ace women and homoromantic ace men are going to have a numerically difficult time finding a partner. On the other hand, if you're a panromantic ace dude, statistics say you have seriously good romantic options haha."
