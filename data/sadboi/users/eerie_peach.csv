EatingDisorders,fnovb9g,t3_g2z40o,1587134284.0,"AH I absolutely feel the same way!!! I worry about this a lot, but honestly my bf doesnt really notice when/what I eat since he doesnt have any issues with food. If breakfast is something you need to not feel lightheaded, then you need it. One thing I've done is constantly reminding myself that there isnt shame in eating, especially when you're hungry (easier said than done). A big part of getting better for me has been forcing myself to have 3 meals and 3 snacks a day. My bf definitely doesnt eat this often or maybe even as much, but I know that that's what works for me.

Another thing!! My bf is a big dude. And I was always freaked out by how it felt to eat more than him during the day. However, I recently found out that he eats super late at night when I'm already asleep!! He hasn't been hiding this or anything disordered, he just gets really hungry at night. Everyone is so so different and it's important to remember that. Maybe your bf just isnt eating around you?"
EatingDisorders,fmzu079,t3_fyasfr,1586529510.0,"I've gone back and forth on this. At the beginning of recovery, intuitive eating was very hard and I often under-ate. I had to count calories just to ensure I wouldnt lose any more weight because it was starting to get dangerous (and I was stubborn about getting a nutritionist which I regret looking back). However, now that I've made more progress in recovery, letting go of calorie counting has absolutely helped. It might be worthwhile to consult a nutritionist to make a meal plan if that is a possibility for you!! Honestly the sooner you can get away from numbers the better"
EatingDisorders,fmso0i9,t3_fx3tsb,1586359129.0,"Doing crafty stuff has really helped me!! My therapist advised me to practice shifting my attention to the present w like mindfulness techniques (rather than just squashing down the ED thoughts). So, cross stitching and watching TV at the same time has been great for down time activities :) and going for walks but bringing my camera or calling a friend has helped too (so I dont obsess over steps or something)"
AnorexiaRecovery,fmbknqu,t1_fmbkdx4,1585928248.0,"I'm sorry you're dealing with that :( honestly I feel guilty a lot too. But!!! That's just your ED trying to keep ahold of you, you need to prioritize healing  :)"
AnorexiaRecovery,fmbk9f5,t3_fuaexa,1585928029.0,"I'm having such a problem with that right now too. It's really scary, but from my understanding it could be extreme hunger. I try to let my self give into it because my body has been deprived for so long. Tips for bloating and not feeling good: take a walk!! Just a short one can help digestion :) and then I try to drink some herbal tea and get an early sleep. Remember that the feeling will pass and that if isnt forever"
EatingDisorders,fm9kmwg,t3_ftutnh,1585870675.0,"It feels really scary right now but I promise it will be worth it!! I had a similar process and kind of went ""all in"" and got scared and stopped. However I would keep trying again and again but each time the binging has become less severe if that makes sense? I think I'm starting to finally stabilize, and am beginning to eat a regular amount of food a day, and then am giving into extreme hunger when it pops up.
I get the whole not being ready to gain weight though :/ It took me awhile to get to a place where i felt ok seeing the scale go up. Its inevitable but getting to enjoy your life again is worth it <3"
CasualConversation,fm9jqbs,t1_fm9hhif,1585870145.0,"Omg I feel that!! I'll be all ""hm why am I so hungry I had a piece of toast and some strawberries?"" And my bf will be like ""omg that's a snack!"" Its crazy how far away u can get from reality, but it gets better every day :)"
CasualConversation,fm9g1nn,t3_fts64o,1585867993.0,I've been struggling with the same thing!! Finally at a healthy weight but still feeling guilty for eating junk/ normal portions of food - so I've been eating tons of it to try and counter those feelings. Over time it totally helps!!!:) much less afraid of certain types of foods and has definitely helped with recovery
