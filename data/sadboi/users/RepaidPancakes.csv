It's just very hard to open up and talk to someone about it."
mentalillness,fpuwvp4,t3_gfk1kc,1588926551.0,"For me being depressed was all I knew. 
I was depressed for as long as I can remember and that was my normal. 

Getting treatment and help has made a huge difference and I'm overcoming it , but at first I didn't know how to live life without the depression. 
It almost felt as if a piece of me was missing."
socialanxiety,fpl3je4,t3_gdzype,1588705731.0,"I get you .
Moments like that keep me up at night , overthinking and reading every detail , but that doesn't helps anything. 

Just remember that they've probably already forgotten about that interaction, and we tend to build situations up so much in our minds that it seems 100 times worse than it actually was. 

Also , your coworkers are butts"
mentalillness,fpknk0j,t3_gdws5w,1588697822.0,"My mental illnesses presents in a completely different way , although it's very anxiety driven. 

I have Social Anxiety , Depression and OCD. 

The social anxiety causes me to avoid any and all social situations. At my worst I couldn't go to the shop by myself or make any phone calls. 
If I go into a public space I feel like everyone notices me and they're secretly judging me. 
Small talk isn't possible , and if someone I'm not comfortable with I'll give awkward responses , if I'm in a group I'm pretty much silent the entire time or standing on a corner by myself. 

The depression feeds off of my anxiety.
I'm not good enough , I'm worthless and a burden to everyone around me. I've had a few suicide attempts and the last one has led me to be hospitalized and then put into the mental ward for a little bit. 

The OCD is just as anxiety driven.
I need order and I need control. If things are changed  then I freak out. 
If things aren't the way I've ordered them then I freak out. 
The intrusive thoughts keep telling me that my life will fall apart if things aren't done in a certain way or by a certain time. 
For example , I have to clean the kitchen every night because what if I die in my sleep , the people who come into the house to fetch my body will be disgusted at how much of a mess my house is. 

But I'm on medication and planning on going through to therapy again , so these symptoms aren't all present at the moment"

AvPD,fpapwa8,t1_fpamrpu,1588453242.0,"I can honestly relate to so many points.
I found out about anxiety quite late in my life , after thinking that I was just broken and couldn't live a normal life , and looking through the different types of anxiety I matched social anxiety to a T. 

The first time I learnt about AvPD I was shocked because I could relate to so many of the symptoms and I felt that it actually describes me better than a simple social phobia. 

Thank you for your answer."
mentalhealth,fp9tjmm,t3_gc58p3,1588434255.0,"If you're not being taken seriously then maybe you're not talking to the right people. 

I felt the same, as if no one took me seriously ... I was even told that I'm too young to have depression. 

I felt so alone , and I felt terrible for talking about what I was feeling because it was a burden. 

It took a suicide attempt for me to realise that I was relying on the wrong people, and even though I didn't know it there were people who truly care for me and wanted to help .

I think that in our darkest times we convince ourselves that we are alone and further isolate ourselves. 

It gets better , with the right help. And heck, even though I'm just some stranger on the internet I'm here for you."

Depression can often cause us to isolate ourselves even though we desire comfort from someone else.

depression,foxvqro,t3_ga6cjz,1588157937.0,"As someone who has tried, multiple times I would have to say that you don't realize how many people are there for you, especially going through a depression.

I feel like they can be quite contradicting, where I'm anxious because I need to do a ritual, but I'm also anxious if people are around because of fear of being judged.

I can never win."
socialanxiety,foupmbt,t3_g9h1ri,1588088296.0,"Yup, even with medication and therapy.
Sometimes I wonder why I struggle with the most basic of interactions when it comes naturally to almost everyone else I know.

Many times I've just broken down into tears because I just want to be normal, and live a normal life without feeling anxious over interactions or feeling guilty about how I've handled an interaction.

It's become a easier with treatment, but the feelings have never fully gone away."
