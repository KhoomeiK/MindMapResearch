abusiverelationships,fqzl9rk,t3_gljioq,1589769719.0,Ugh I can relate to this. I felt this way a lot while pregnant. At the time I kept thinking “well I have to be with him now” but now that my daughter has been here for two years I realize it’s a whole lot harder to leave now. I always had mixed emotions while pregnant but knowing that whatever I did affected the baby really kept me somewhat sane.

relationship_advice,fppyen6,t1_fppxgj7,1588811566.0,"so then there are things that you would see as a justifiable reason for not feeding someone in the same household as you,  caring for your child? I don't think any other details really matter. 
If you must know, I only left out things that would make him look worse. I've said his perspective. He believes I should do all of the parenting and somehow financially contribute too. There's literally no other secrets to tell. If i'm doing something that terrible to be treated this way then it's not because i'm not being ""forthcoming"" it's because I literally don't know what my ""deficiencies"" are"

relationship_advice,fpgp992,t1_fpgopl4,1588607032.0,True. That’s the point I’m at now. He can get over it. I really NEED to work. I’ve actually been asking him if I could get a job for a year now. I know I don’t need his permission but he does scare me.
relationship_advice,fpgoxru,t1_fpgkzrc,1588606864.0,Lmao yup. I’ve actually had to tell him I wouldn’t file for child support because of the threats he makes. Best believe that’s the first thing I’m doing when I leave though

relationship_advice,fpgog14,t1_fpg2w2l,1588606603.0,"Spot on. He wants me to grow money from trees. I’ve brought up getting a job several times and he makes up a bunch of reasons on why I shouldn’t get one. I don’t even fully trust him to care for our daughter if I work. Apparently my state offers help with childcare so I’m going to look into that ASAP. I do chores around the house. I clean daily, but it’s never a good job. He used to say all the time “you could always do more” like no, I can’t. I’m fucking exhausted. Thank you though, you made some really good points and I appreciate the realistic view."
relationship_advice,fpgno2u,t1_fpg5k41,1588606190.0,"This is my plan. Get a job and save. I’m really worried about leaving my daughter alone with him though. He has no clue on how to take care of her or handle her. He constantly leaves knives in places she can reach them, leaves the door open, things like that. He flat out refuses to watch her at night/wake up early to watch her because he works. Just the other day I told him I saw a job online and the starting time was 445 am. He started to go off about how will I take care of our daughter if I’m tired from working. With his hours I could only work super early or graveyard shifts. Which I’m absolutely willing to do. Sadly he acts like he isn’t willing to watch our daughter if I do. 

I do have a few pictures of marks he left on me but they’re from years ago. My worst fear is being homeless and of course he’d be the one to get our daughter which he’s rubbed in my face several times."
relationship_advice,fpgl82z,t1_fpeueln,1588604877.0,"Yup. I struggle with depression and anxiety and busting my ass all day, chasing our toddler, only to have him say I’m lazy... it breaks me. I have back problems too and I do EVERYTHING for her. I have to beg this man to open up a fucking door for me when we’re in public and I’m pushing the stroller. It’s so embarrassing. I do have a few pictures from years ago that show his abusive ways. I’ve brought up getting child support a few times and it didn’t go over well at all. His sister actually pulled me aside one day and told me “you better not ever try to get child support from my brother” .. they think I’m supposed to somehow support myself and that if I leave him then I should get nothing.

I’ve looked into those things you mentioned, every time I’ve tried getting food stamps they want the information of people I live with. When assistance programs hear how much my bf makes they don’t want to give me anything. I got rejected for food stamps but they did give my daughter and I free healthcare. (As free as it gets here) and I have been thinking about explaining my situation though. I didn’t even get a fucking stimulus check because apparently he’s been claiming me as a dependent on tax returns and therefore I’m not eligible.

He’s definitely part of the problem. I’d tell him and her mother to kiss my butt and send her to therapy anyways if you can. Especially if it’s you doing all of the actual parenting. You sound like you try to include her in everything so idk, at this point maybe it is both her being a hormonal 12 year old and the way she was raised definitely contributes to that. Sorry and good luck to you, I hope things continue to get better"
stepparents,fntnpat,t1_fntmz3m,1587245324.0,"Okay but it’s too late to dwell on how the 12 year old was raised. You don’t have to accept “that’s just how she is” but maybe take it into mind she was raised differently and probably has a completely different outlook on things than your other kids. You seem to be putting in a lot of work and effort to improving her and her life so that’s great. I just think it’s really odd to talk about children in such a separate way (MY kids don’t act like that, MY kids don’t do this or that) but idk your life story or whatever so. I can only make observations. I doubt you let sd hear things like that but if her whole family is saying those kinds of things I probably wouldn’t feel like showering or being nice either"
stepparents,fntidiz,t1_fnt3hk5,1587242261.0,Yea. Based on the post and how she describes her kids to be so perfect compared to SD.. some of the way she acts might be justified
stepparents,fnti421,t1_fnszpop,1587242108.0,Not to piggyback but THIS is such a great comment. My younger sister was exactly like how op described sd all the way down to pouting. Then she got really into soaps and nail polish. It keeps her clean and gives her a hobby! I think it made her feel more mature too. She’s 16 now and still enjoys doing those things.

relationship_advice,fkppliw,t3_fjwnv0,1584415912.0,I was really worried this would happen to me when I got pregnant. I have a Facebook mom but luckily I made it very clear she couldn’t announce it until I was ready. I don’t use Facebook much myself but she does. If I was you I’d probably make my own status saying it’s still really early on and you’re being cautious or however you want to word it. It sucks she ruined the announcement but I’d be annoyed with everyone trying to talk to me about the pregnancy so early on too.
