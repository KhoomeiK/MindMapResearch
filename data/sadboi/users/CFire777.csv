GoodJudys,fl46exs,t1_fl45phi,1584806926.0,"Of course I would not have a problem if he posted this any other time, because I usually enjoy his content. But things are going on, and to pretend otherwise is tone deaf. If we need to be aware of our own emotions, he should be aware of how his actions would be perceived. 
Answering criticism with ""you need to be aware that you're upset because of you, nothing he did"" is not fair. I'm upset because he uploaded a tone deaf video and seems to have no perception of what's actually going on. 
He broke quarantine. That's not okay with me. Hes pushing merch on people that don't have money to spend. That's not okay with me. And I'm not going to pretend that my criticisms are invalid because you don't like them. 
You being excited is a great thing, and I'm glad that you're excited for his next release. On some level, I am too. And I'm glad that you got some good feelings from his video, even if I didn't."

I don't know, his video just kind of rubbed me the wrong way. I don't want to hear more about the virus either, but he did talk about the virus. And then switched immediately over to talking about his new products. He is aware, and I think the thing that bothered me is the complete switch from ""things are hard, the virus sucks"" to ""buy my merch!"".
About the employees being home with pay. I think that's great. But I also don't think we should praise a multi millionaire that's not hurting too much right now for doing the right thing. Of course we can say ""good for you Jeffree"" but idk. I know a lot of other businesses are doing the same and they aren't able to afford that out of pocket. 
Basically, he made a video he knew would get views with a clickbait virus title and then went out and broke quarantine to get a new car and brag about his new stuff coming out. I love him but I just think there is a time and place"

relationship_advice,feso9u9,t3_eqef93,1579367359.0,"Ok, to me there are to separate issues here. 
The first is that your boyfriend isn't able to cum. You might suspect this already, but this is most likely due to his excessive masturbation. He has taught himself to cum to his touch and through porn, so what you are doing isn't getting him there. This is a HIM problem. You are doing nothing wrong. 
The second, way bigger issue IMO, is his lack of respect for you. You say he treats you like a sex doll. He doesn't care about you coming or not. He expects excessive sex and blowjobs despite medical conditions. He refuses to listen to your concerns regarding masturbation. You are not a toy. Your purpose is not to serve him. And honestly, I hate to say it, but this is - at a minimum - huge red flag behavior. 
Talk to him. Show him this post. And if nothing changes, show yourself the respect he isn't willing to give you and leave."
