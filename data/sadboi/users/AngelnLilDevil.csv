Her brain was intact & she should have been able to make her own decisions, but her mom wanted to keep her alive & kept her from communicating with most everyone. There were so many dynamics to that particular case & the patient played a part in causing the brain bleed that caused her to be locked in, by smoking while on the birth control pill. It’s a long story but one of the only instances where I believe that karma played a roll in what happened. And I don’t believe in karma.

I only mention my female blackness if it’s going to be an advantage to me. In the same way i would let a future employer know that I don’t have children (because people with kids have daycare issues, higher absentee rate, etc.). You got into medical school because you EARNED it! I’m a (black) RN of 20 years & my best friend is a (white) MD. I’ll never forget when a white classmate found out that I had scored higher then her on an exam. She was completely disturbed by it and for her, it was humiliating that someone black got a better grade. And then there was the time I was working at an upscale world renown hospital that happened to have a clinic attached to it. I was referred to a pulmonologist at the clinic & he picked up that I was very knowledgeable in medicine. He asked me what I did for a living & I responded with, “RN” and then he asked me where I worked & which specialty? I explained that I was one of the few float nurses at the hospital and worked on Solid Organ Transplant, Oncology/Bone Marrow Transplant, and Telemetry Step-down, depending upon who needed me. The doctor acted shocked & then became very condescending. He said, “Wow! You must be so proud of yourself by getting an education & I’m sure you understand how lucky you are to be chosen to work here.” I didn’t even know how to reply to that... Anyways,  Best advice I can give you is to be prepared for the others in your class and then in Residency, to act like competitive a holes, every step of the way.

There’s a group called Black Men in White Coats that advocates for Black doctors & if you reach out to them, they can probably connect you with other black female doctors. Oh, and I just found this...

www.blackwomenphysicians.org, which has an article titled, The ‘Invisible Whit Coat’: Black Women in Medicine.  

It’s important to find a mentor who knows exactly what you’re going through & that can give you sound advice. Especially when choosing a specialty. I met a black Family Practice doctor at the hair salon & she said that she hated Family Practice. She chose it in part because a portion of her student loans would be forgiven if she worked in an underserved area for ten years post graduation. She said that she felt trapped. But hey, we can’t all be like my best friend, who’s parents wrote him a fat check to pay off his loans, as a graduation present. Choose your specialty wisely. If you want to have a semi normal life & family after medical school (i.e. no call), then steer towards psychiatry, derm, podiatry, pathology, radiology. Otherwise, follow your absolute passion!   You got this!!!"
BDSMAdvice,fhbirl0,t3_f1xt9x,1581443125.0,"I’m a woman & can tell you that I was in the same situation when kink & BDSM was new to me. In the beginning my Dom cured my lack of interest (and preconceived ideas) by making it all about me & my pleasure. He wanted me to feel comfortable and open to the idea of adding more kink into our sex life. But most importantly, he wanted me to be completely and utterly turned on. A big part of that was sensual touch (using objects like a feather, fingernails, fur mitten, etc.), talk, blindfolds, candlelight, a little wine & sensual spanking. He taught me that just about anything can be sexualized (not children, animals, scat, any hard no’s). In the beginning, it’s about there not being any pressure, a relaxed setting, making her feel comfortable (t-shirt and panties rather then heels and corset). You pretty much need to ask her questions while you are playing with her & learn her body. Communication is the key & initiating play at unexpected times will also help. Once you “Train” her to like the idea, then You can plan a once a month date, but it shouldn’t be on a day that she works. I can tell you what has helped with me & people that I’ve turned into subs.

I’m sorry your father was a patient/victim of the VA. Before I was hired on the SCI unit,  I mainly worked on their cardiac & surgical floors. I was absolutely shocked at the amount and severity of post operative complications that I saw.  Patients would go in for a basic outpatient laparoscopic hernia repair & end up coming back 3 days later at deaths door because the surgical resident had nicked the bowel. VA’s are teaching hospitals, but under the Federal govnt., so they don’t have to adhere by the stringent rules that all other hospitals have. In my opinion, their surgical patients are used as guinea pigs for the residents to learn on. When the Joint Commission came to survey, they gave our hospital really high scores & I was absolutely shocked. The surveyors said that it was the best VA that they had seen. Which translates into saying that the other VA’s are even worse! The regulatory agencies have reason to give glowing scores to VA’s because the federal govnt funds those agencies. 

How long ago was your injury, and what level is it? Is it complete or incomplete? Are you on Baclofen, gabapentin, or any pain medication? 

I have chronic pain & Cymbalta has really helped. It’s an antidepressant, but also used for chronic pain patients. In the beginning, I didn’t really know if the Cymbalta was making a difference. But I lost my insurance & couldn’t afford to pay $300 month for it. I stopped taking it & two weeks later, I woke up & could barely move. In addition, all my joints & muscles hurt. Fortunately, I live by the Mexican border, so I was able to go there & get a month supply for $75 instead of $300.  I strongly believe that deep tissue massage & Rolfing can really help SCI patients, but both therapies are out of pocket costs."

I found it ironic that our patients on regular medical floors never wanted to get out of bed & walk around, but the majority of our spinal patients wanted to be dressed & in their wheelchairs by 7am. I’m not working at the VA anymore because I witnessed some really horrific treatment of a few patients,  & many (but not all) of my co-workers showed  absolutely no empathy or compassion towards the patients. I was continually shamed for caring!

Very few people and even doctors understand or believe that SCI patients can have pain. I would have to say that the neurogenic/nerve pain that spinal cord patients have is the worst and most excruciating that I have EVER seen in over 20 years of being a nurse.  I took care of quadriplegic Marines who have gone through unimaginable trauma & injuries from war, only to be completely emotionally tortured after a spinal injury.

The ‘guest’ therapist that day was an intern working on getting the last of her hours for state licensure. She didn’t know any of us, or the circumstances which led us to be there. But the patients in our group had gone through the most horrific & unspeakable acts of torture & abuse. The ‘therapist’ walked in, introduce herself, and announced that happiness is a choice that we choose to make every day upon waking up. And if we are depressed, it’s because we choose to be. It took everything in me not to tell her what a fucking moron she was and to get the fuck out of class. But I have to admit, it was a healthy coping mechanism, in not doing so!!! 

BTW, she was one of hundreds of future therapist going to Alliant International University here in California.

I’d stress to him that if/when you move out, he’s going to have a difficult time finding someone to rent your apartment long term & new tenants aren’t going to want to deal with someone else’s dog shit. Especially if they have kids that play in the yard. You might want to install a decibel app on your phone or get a cheap decibel meter on Amazon for $20-   Another really good way to get evidence of them being loud, would be to use your cell phone to video tape how loud it gets. You would have good cause to get out of your lease if you have an electronic paper trail of notifying the landlord of the nuisance. I think that if you literally send your landlord an email every single time it’s too loud, and attach a video clip that documents it, that he’s going to want to get them out. If they do move, you might want to move into the upper unit to avoid ever having an upstairs neighbor there. In addition, talk to your landlord about rules that should be added to the lease in regards to pets. Not just cleaning up after pets, but yearly proof of vaccines & license. (If it were my rental & it was a shared yard, it would have to be picked up at the time the dog poops & hosed down as needed).He can attach it as an addendum to the lease.

I looked at him & said, “Are you seriously suicide shaming me? You don’t know anything about me, do you? I don’t even have kids & the last time I checked shaming your patient isn’t part of the therapeutic milieu. I’m your worst nightmare. I’m a RN & very knowledgeable & experienced with psych meds. My best friend of 18 years is a practicing psychiatrist & I know exactly what you’re supposed to be assessing me for & discussing with me. I’ve seen you for 5 days and you don’t even know who I am. If you haven’t bothered to read my H & P (history & physical), then you’re not going to be my doctor. I want a new doctor.” The staff on the unit violated patient privacy all the time & openly talked about a very complex patient who was a post op transgender female to male. It was so sad because he was actively delusional, genuinely believed he was Jesus, & had been there for 8 months under a court ordered conservatorship. The one thing this kid (22 yo) had going for him was a very supportive family. He had had a psychotic episode where he became homeless & assaulted someone,  & the family recognized that he needed psychiatric care rather then prison. He would have been victimized in prison & not given the help that he needed. I had previously worked as a nurse at two state prisons & knew that he wouldn’t have survived the sentence. Seeing & experiencing how horrible the care was at that hospital, contributed to me getting more depressed because it was clear to me that most of the staff there didn’t give a damn about the patients. I was in the room when a nurse came in & asked a patient if he was still actively having command hallucinations telling him to kill himself & the patient said, “yes”. Then the nurse said do you still feel that you need to be here for your safety? The patient replied “yes”. Then the nurse flippantly said, “Well, I hope you don’t still feel that way in the morning because you’re getting discharged.” Nine hours later, they discharged an actively suicidal patient. It was at that point that I told my doctor that he was going to have to show me documented proof that I was a danger to self, others, or gravely disabled & if he didn’t, I would sue the F@#k out of him & the hospital for holding me against my will in order to collect insurance benefits. It was amazing, because I was discharged the next day. And that was despite that my doctor had just placed me on a 14 day hold the previous day! It sounds like your doctor is a decent person."
GetOutOfBed,fd0q3ni,t3_eja3j3,1578122239.0,"I’m sorry your mom is being a jerk. It’s soul crushing when the people we need the most aren’t supportive. I left home at 14 to get away from an abusive & toxic family. I found that friends & strangers showed me more respect & kindness. My best friend is a psychiatrist & doesn’t have an issue with his patients drinking coffee. I haven’t heard of meds with contraindications to caffeine, but there are probably a few. Inpatient psych/behavioral health units only serve decaf & sugar free drinks. It’s mainly because acute patients should avoid stimulants & many inpatients have a dual diagnosis with substance abuse. They don’t like allowing inpatient drug & alcohol patients real sugar or caffeine. I think it’s ridiculous because they drug the shit out of inpatients. Some to the point where they’re falling asleep mid sentence or during meals. I’m a RN & have seen it first hand. In addition, most of the patients used sugar & caffeine before admission & will return to it after. But, many psych units allow smoking which is more mood altering then sugar & caffeine.  I’m glad you got a cat. I adopted one about 4 months ago & she doesn’t meow, purr, cuddle, or like to be touched. It’s aggravating, but I’m glad she’s around."

GetOutOfBed,fcyjqh9,t1_fcxmq0c,1578081231.0,"Don’t rule out coffee or caffeinated drinks. I have ADD/ADHD & it helps perk me up. I would suggest researching all the medications that you’re taking & discussing the anorexia with your doctor. You absolutely need an adequate amount of calories, fats, carbs, proteins & essential vitamins to physically feel well. In addition, laying in bed for prolonged periods of time leads to reconditioning & fatigue, but can also cause body aches & pains. I’ve experienced this first hand. I have similar symptoms as you & although I still have a difficult time getting motivated, two medications have helped. My ADD medication does help to lift my mood & Cymbalta, an antidepressant, works wonders on chronic pain. Part of what might help you feel a bit better is trying to empower yourself when it comes to your treatment plan & overall health. Learn about your meds & if they aren’t working ask for something else. If your current therapist isn’t helping you to set small goals & being accountable, then find a therapist who will. If it’s possible to have a pet, like a dog or cat, that really makes a difference, but I wouldn’t suggest getting a puppy because it’s a tremendous amount of work & training, unless you’re up to it.

Look, when I was 16 I had a lot of men interested in me & most of them were in their 30’s and 40’s. I dated a guy in his mid 30’s because I was so flattered that he wanted to be my boyfriend. It wasn’t until I became a grown woman that realized that men over 20 have no business having sex with a 16 year old. There are laws against it for a reason. Report him to the police for the alcohol & the sex with a minor. He is absolutely NOT allowed to have sex with a subordinate, let alone bring alcohol to the workplace. Also, see if your company has a “Values” hotline where you can report safety & ethical issues anonymously. Most healthcare facilities do. The boss may be a nice guy, but he’s taking a big risk by bringing alcohol to work, giving to minors  & having sex with a minor. The facility could get sued by those parents, the girl, & lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. He needs to be stopped."

insomnia,fb61y4o,t3_ebkzri,1576539365.0,"Melatonin isn’t a sleeping medication (supplement) in the traditional sense. It only helps to regulate our circadian rhythm, so that your body will want to go to sleep. In order for it to work, it has to be taken at the same time every night & you need a strict bedtime routine & sleep schedule. In addition, because our circadian rhythm is effected by light/dark, you shouldn’t have any lights on in your bedroom, no tv, no looking at phone, electronics, etc. 

Having said that, I have an almost full bottle of dissolving melatonin from Costco! It’s really hard to discipline myself in to a bedtime routine, quiet time, bath, no tv, no answering calls, and focusing on sleep! Keep in mind that as a nurse, I’ve worked 12 hour night shifts for almost 2 decades. My circadian rhythm doesn’t exist.
