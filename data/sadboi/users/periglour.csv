1. The predatory wlw fear. This ties in with the push/pull. We were always portrayed as predatory, and our only real point of reference for loving women were the men around us and on tv. (The men who tend to make us feel uncomfortable and unsafe, hence our own anxieties we're being predatory)

 
2. Gender. Gender is complex because of how we've been raised up to see, view and relate to womanhood. That specific conditioning does not relate to all women, especially not lgbt women, so a lot of us tend to be trans to some degree or otherwise gnc. For the millionth fucking time I have to figure out my gender identity because its so frustrating to figure out. Rather than being allowed to explore things as children, we were *trained* to be a certain way, so now we have to teach *ourselves* what it means to be a woman, or whatever we are. This applies to most lgbt people who are dfab, not just wlw

 
3. A complicated relationship with men. As part of our training, the conditioning to be a mans other half is deeply embedded into a lot of us. We were raised to be their mom, their lover, their best friend, their housekeper, their accountant...so its confusing coming to terms with being a lesbian in particular, since you need to program out this compulsory heterosexuality and unrealistic marriage expectations."

Midwestern white americans have their own culture. City-dwelling African americans have their own culture. Rural, southern african Americans have their own culture. However, general ethnic groups have a lot of overlap in their respective regional cultures, which is why ""african american"", ""Asian american"" ""italian american"" ""Russian american"" are all labels. This is ESPECIALLY the case if the groups are more highly populated by immigrants. Smaller areas tend to be a bit more homogeneous in their identity and their presentation, while america is so large it only makes sense for certain communities to form with their own self-identifiers. 

In terms of race and ethnicity, america has always been really xenophobic (like with the Irish, russians, italians) or racist (like everybody else who isnt white) so it's a natural inclination to ""group"" together and make your own communities of people with similar backgrounds. America is not as welcoming and opening as one would like you to think, though it's definitely gotten better than it once was. 

 Its difficult for people to understand if they come from a smaller country where it's easier to ""mesh in"" upon immigration. There is no one, *American* culture. Californians live so far away from bostonians that its absolutely unreasonable to think they have the same culture. This is why when we declare our location, we declare a state and not our country. Our state is the more identifying factor. Out state is our home, the country happens to just be where our home is located.

personalfinance,fiilqd4,t3_f82n4u,1582423028.0,It was my first an only bank since I was first working at 15. I decided to move to aspiration a week ago and I'm already much happier than I was with wf. They were such a goddamn fucking headache and loved to charge me for stupid nonsense. I once had about 20-30$ in overdraw fees because I had forgotten about an automatic payment that put me just a few dollars under. I've turned on overdraft protection several times and it never works.
NoFap,fiikddo,t3_f82ne7,1582422635.0,"I've already lost virginity, but I see no shame in hiring an escort. My current partner is a former sex worker and they're obviously very good at what they do and they're helping me get over a lot of my anxiety around sex. As sex was formerly how they survived, they learned quickly how to soothe nerves and read body language. It's very nice to be the center of attention by someone who knows what they're doing. If you can afford it, there really isn't much harm in doing so imo. They're usually clean.

If your virginity is a big deal to you though, you may want to hire an escort after your first time because of social taboos. It's really up to you though."
NoFap,fifwdej,t3_f7vy65,1582393910.0,"I personally have a much harder time orgasming like, in general. I'm trying to withhold masturbating for orgasm for a while to see if I can have sex and orgasm without having to think about porn I've watched. It's really common for women to have sexual dysfunction (I think mine is arousal specifically) so I want to make sure it's not my porn addiction before I go to a doctor for it."

I dont vape myself really, I just occasionally will buy a rig or some no-nic juice to get my nic-addicted friends to stop offering me their shit. I really like how you have to validate your identity when you try to buy anything. It was frustrating when I was under 18 (under 21 now but I dont care as I've got my shit) but that's the point"

NoFap,fi8akw3,t1_fi7zz3t,1582236541.0,"Oh absolutely, I agree. I just can already sense the disappointment when it doesnt work out despite the excitement of younger and more naive signers. I would love if the petition would work, but I think awareness needs to be raised differently. Petitions (especially on change.org) have gotten kind of a bad reputation because of how ineffective they tend to be online. 

I'm just not sure how we can convince the US government to regulate the adult film industry, since it's so taboo to openly talk about sex here (despite how progressive we consider ourselves). At least right now, given who we have running the country. We have some of course, but as we've seen, those existing rules are difficult to enforce online. Regulation laws are only a small portion of the battle. I dont want people who are unaware of the limited power of petitions to get their hopes up. 

Pornhub doesnt care about its audience or members despite what they may try to do for PR, so I doubt they'll do very much in the way of working on their deeply rooted industry flaws. Perversion and exploitation makes them good money, after all. If they cared about their userbase, they wouldn't exist. If they cared about the actors and actresses, they wouldn't be a free service."
NoFap,fi7vs3e,t1_fi7uqjr,1582229062.0,"No I'm against the major porn industry. This just feels very ""PETITION TO END CAPITALISM!!!"" Since it's such a huge huge industry that makes a lot of money and has a lot of power, all things considered.

(I say major as I am a supporter of independent sex workers, they deserve support for them doing what they do, it's a very vulnerable occupation. I hate pornhub for many reasons, content theft being a big one)"
actuallesbians,fi7us8o,t3_f6y5p1,1582228552.0,"The gloves are more like a hand condom if that makes sense. The sterility isn't terribly important from what I've gathered, but if you're really concerned, ordering sterile gloves online wouldn't hurt. 

Your hands have WAYYY WAYYYYY more bacteria and stuff on them than nitrile gloves do. It's also an extra protection against nails, just in case they're not quite as short as you thought they were."
