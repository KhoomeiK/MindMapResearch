birthcontrol,fpqn8e0,t3_gewkdd,1588826864.0,"You are definitely not alone - most women struggle to find a birth control that works for them. You shouldn’t feel guilty that this one might not be working for you, and I wouldn’t write off the idea of trying something else out of fear. I know this one may have seemed perfect, but you never know until you try. If you’re afraid of something being less effective you could always use barrier methods in conjunction. If you don’t feel like you can remember something everyday, set an alarm. Whatever works for you! I’ve been on the pill for over ten years and haven’t had any issues - but everyone is different. 

I personally don’t know a lot about the implant, but I’d recommend doing some research and see if severe mood swings is a common side effect. It also may be that your body is just getting used to the hormones. I think 6 months is typically the adjustment period, but for some it takes longer. 

If you really feel like this method isn’t working out, I’d encourage you to talk to a doctor or sex educator about different options and do some more research to see if there’s something else you’d like to try. It may take a bit of time, and learning, perhaps some speed bumps along the way - but you’ll get there. Just know this is something all of us women go through, and don’t feel guilty about it. It’s your journey, your choice, and ultimately you get to choose what goes in your body. Hopefully that gives you some reassurance <3"
mentalhealth,fp90em2,t3_gc0hjw,1588409522.0,"I also tend to bottle things up, and I have some serious trust issues. Because of this I was always compelled to do all the research myself and self-diagnose. While it was really good for me to be aware of my triggers and be actively trying to piece together my inner thoughts and experiences, I actually did more damage than good by putting all that on myself and keeping things in for so long. I used to hate it when people advised me to see a professional. I took it as an insult. I would have rather done everything in my power than be vulnerable with someone. I finally got to a point where I was fantasizing about death everyday, I was so overwhelmed I didn’t know what else to do. So I finally broke down and reached out to a counsellor, and it was terrifying. I was a mess waiting for the appointment. The first session was the most uncomfortable I’ve ever been in my life. But you know what; I’m still doing it, and I’ve never been better! 

I would strongly recommend that you relinquish some of that self-control, and ask for help. Be willing to be vulnerable and trust someone who knows the ins and outs of metal disorders. Because everyone’s experience is unique. There are likely emotions and blockages laying just beneath the surface that a person wouldn’t even know to look for. My councillor and I have already uncovered a major hang up for me, in just a month of me going. I would have never seen it without her guidance. I’m not saying it will be the exact same for you, but I know it will help immensely. 

In the meantime, try to be easy on yourself while going through this phase of self discovery, and opening up for the first time - that’s a huge step! There is no guideline or “fix”, per se. You are not broken, you just see things through a different lens, one that does not suit you anymore - which can be distressing. For example. When I was a child, I was never safe, never cared for. I learned to always be alert, and aware, and assessing. I wouldn’t have survived otherwise. Now these things don’t have a place in my life. I am safe, and I am cared for - but my lens hasn’t changed. I’m still in survival mode, but there’s no reason for it. This is something I have to train my brain out of. Replace the lens with something more fitting to my lifestyle now.

I hope this helps, and doesn’t come off as too convoluted. I’ve been in your position, probably under different circumstances and with different tendencies - but I recognize the drive you have to figure this all out and do it as much on your own as possible. My counsellor told me that if you are looking for something, you’ll see it everywhere. Your thoughts can manifest physical reactions in your body. Sometimes it’s best to not look. I know that may feel wrong, but it’s better for your mental health - just try not to obsess and fixate. That’s when things start going downhill, for me anyway."

On a side note - when I first started dabbling in spells, I immediately went into darker things, and I regret doing so. I had no idea what I was doing and it manifested quite unfavourably. I would suggest starting out slow and learn how to control emotions, and the ability to focus inward and be attuned to your will; these are extremely important in spell-work."

BodyAcceptance,fmij8u0,t3_fv8b74,1586110671.0,"I think you have to accept your own body, and understand that no one can ever reach a perfect standard. We all struggle with body issues. But you have to love yourself as you are in order to achieve any kind of happiness. 

As a society, everyone is objectified in one way or another. Women feel a lot of pressure on how they “should” look as well. As a man, maybe you feel like you have to be “the standard” and you don’t feel worthy any other way - it’s unfair because for the most part in our society men are made to feel that they aren’t allowed to have feelings and that they need to be the perfect breadwinners for their mates. I think there’s a lot of body acceptance nowadays for women, but I don’t see it a lot for men. It doesn’t help that most men have this deeply ingrained notion that they cannot openly express these kind of things, so instead they internalize it. I hope someday soon we become more inclusive on that front, and men start to change their stance on this. 

I see my own partner struggle with insecurity, and a lot of it is his own perception. He won’t listen when I say he’s worthy and his body is fine the way it is - but he’s so set in his stance. We’ve been together for ten years, and I’ve never once ridiculed his appearance. He just inherently feels great pressure to be a certain way, and you probably do too. 

I just want you to know that there are people who value you, and you are not JUST a body - you are so much more than your appearance. If you can’t love yourself now then you never will, even if you did everything possible to meet that “standard” you crave so badly - it will never be enough (I speak from experience, as someone who has struggled as well). You will never be happy if you are always seeking approval from others - because people are usually just wrapped up in themselves, it’s not really even about you. When people put you down, it’s only a projection of their own insecurities. Trust me; you can love yourself. It will shine through you and that in and of itself will be the most attractive thing about you. Confidence is key. 

I genuinely hope you are able to see that one day <3"

I don’t know if this would be available where you live, but there’s an app called Babylon and it’s a really good symptom checker (in my experience), it might help to get a bit of an idea that what. 


OR wait until tomorrow and if it’s worse you can do something then. If it’s better, then good :)"
Anxiety,fkjwye1,t3_fiy6f3,1584263503.0,"I almost constantly think there is something horribly wrong with me or that I have a disease - so I totally get what you mean. But anxiety can affect a person physically and thus have physical effects, which can be impossible to accept since technically it’s just a state of mind. It’s incredible just how well the brain can trick you; it can be hard to differentiate between real and not real since the same fight or flight response is active as when someone is faced with an actual danger. 

One thing I suggest is grounding. Bring yourself back into your body and really assess how you feel and your surroundings. Just know, if there was something wrong - you very likely wouldn’t be questioning it. Anytime I’ve had something actually wrong with me, I’m more calm and focused than I’m usually ever in my day to day life. It’s strange how that is works.

Hopefully that helps you a bit. Feel free to vent to me if you want :)"
Anxiety,fkjw9qw,t3_fiy9xn,1584262586.0,"It might help to talk to a professional. The best thing I ever did was seek help, it’s daunting at first but well worth it. I’ve heard really good things about crisis lines, if you think you might be more comfortable with that - they’ll just talk with you. They won’t force any advice or anything like that. It’s 100% a safe space. It might help just to bounce some of your feelings off someone.

I’m here as well if you wanna talk <3"
Anxiety,fjjc83f,t1_fjja153,1583390033.0,Thanks :) I’m sure I’ll like it. I appreciate your input!
Anxiety,fjid8db,t1_fjhmygj,1583365128.0,"Yeah. I guess it’s hard too, because most people I know don’t know much about cars, so they wouldn’t even know how to advise me. 

It’s a Honda Fit EX - I wanted a subcompact, and I know they aren’t the fastest, but that’s not really a priority for me. Fuel efficiency is at the top of my list, I also appreciate that it has a roomy interior (for a small car), and it’s rated pretty well on safety/reliability. I know it’ll have good resale value too. The EX also had a lot of cool premium features, and it wasn’t crazy expensive. Seemed like a win-win situation."
Anxiety,fjeixne,t1_fjdx809,1583272545.0,"Thank you for taking the time to respond! I really appreciate the feedback :) I always feel like people in my life are just telling me what I want to hear, so an outsiders perspective is really nice!! Thanks again."
pestcontrol,filbkzq,t1_fil97h0,1582497894.0,"Yeah, I figured that. I’ve done a full sweep every year and they always come back no matter how vigilant I am. I think they’re coming from another apartment or maybe some hidden areas in the complex. 

Thanks for the advice."
Anxiety,fhisw33,t1_fhisgyg,1581631160.0,"Thanks for that :) sometimes I feel so freakish. I do obsessively file my nails and pick stuff out from under them - so that’s not bad necessarily. But it’s not nearly as satisfying and I can only really do it a few times a day, lol."
story,fh887p8,t1_fh56x09,1581354174.0,"It’s definitely nice to know someone can understand :) 

I’ve personally never vocalized or heard anyone talk about living in a made up world in their head as a child, so that was really cool for me to hear."
story,fh3jkvs,t3_f14cvw,1581269601.0,"Wow, it’s crazy how similar you and I are. I remember having an entire world of fantasy in my head as a kid as well. It was an escape, because I felt so helpless in the real world. So scared and alone. 

I noticed near the beginning of your story; you had prefaced it with downplaying your experience by saying you’ve never been “chained to a radiator” - but even so, you have been the victim of some serious mental abuse... physical too in the way of your sister, and your uncle. Even if he just took a photo that is still a complete violation of your privacy. I guess I just want you to know, your trauma is valid. You have a right to be upset and feel that these thing were wrong. 

Please know that none of what you went through was your fault. It can be really hard to come to terms with those things you experienced as a child and never fully understood until you were older. But you did everything you could to survive, so don’t ever feel guilty for the coping mechanisms that got you through. 

I’m very sorry you had to go through all that, and especially that your sister made it worse for you. I wonder why she decided to take the route she did. 

If you ever need to talk to someone who understands, I’m here :)"

All I’ve ever asked for is the minimum amount of guidance a human deserves when seeking medical attention. I was quite literally told they had no time for me when I called today. I was just asking why my prescription had been discontinued. Tell me if that comes off as being a “difficult patient”."
