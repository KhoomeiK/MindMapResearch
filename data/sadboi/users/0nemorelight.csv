u_LostSuggestion1,fqwofts,t3_gkxea7,1589712002.0,"Inspiring! I have lost nearly 90lbs in 9 months and I agree it is a gratifying feeling, I definitely feel like I'm finally on the path to being able to sustain this weight without gaining it back. I tried countless diets but I kept gaining it back and I ALMOST gave in but I got a new job which is physically demanding, got a bike to exercise with when I'm not at work, moved out where I can control the food that is around me (ie not having snacks to tempt me or meals conveniently precooked for me), and finally feel like I might even enjoy my summer without being incredibly depressed about my weight. 

Well done, you did amazing. What was your start and end weight? What's your goal?"
adhdmeme,fqwnoph,t3_gku4zx,1589711217.0,So accurate. Like almost every aspect of my personality I seem to be able to trace back to ADHD now that I've been diagnosed. It makes so much sense now. Like my nonsense makes sense

Depersonalization,fqwmth6,t3_gl71pe,1589710309.0,"I used to do a lot of drugs but the one that triggered DP/DR for me was probably acid. It was life changing, in the fact that I never took drugs again and I have been clean for a long time now, yet something changed fundamentally within me and I don't know if i'll ever be any different. Can't decide whether it was a blessing or a curse. It changed the way I think, behave, and see the world, either for the worse or for the better. The only thing you can do is realise that it happened, it's gonna stick around for a while, so might as well get settled with it. It's a scary and unfamiliar thing at first but it seems you are used to it, and though it sucks to still feel so out of place in the world/society/even in your own skin, you know you'll survive. And it's almost certain one day you'll come out of it. Personally, I'm so used to this state of unfamiliarity with the woman in the mirror and the outside world that I'm sure I feel more like myself now, as I ever did. That's why the thought of going back, to a me that is no longer me anymore, might be just as scary as me turning into the new me that is now the only me I know. 

It's a trippy feelin, but hey, that's what happens when you trip, I guess. I hope you learn to feel more at ease with your dp/dr, despite how scary and unnatural it can feel at times. And yes, I'd recommend talking to your parents and maybe a professional."

dpdr,fmvkh9l,t3_fxdrl9,1586420260.0,"Honestly I took acid a couple times back in Uni and although it was the most spiritual experience of my entire life and made me lose my ego completely, I also wonder if that's what caused my DP/DR. The feelings are often the same as when I took acid like the warped view of the world, overwhelming of the senses, disattachment from one's body. It's very similar, and I don't know when it started but it may very well have been after taking psychedelics. I wouldn't give up those experiences for anything though, they put me on a path and a journey that gives me hope for a better life for my soul.

I have felt like I've been on some kind of awakening journey for a while now, starting when I gave up my fashion design dreams because I came disillusioned with the industry and all its fakeness, and disillusioned with business and it's schemes to trick customers. It was long and difficult and I often wished I was unaware of these things but the more I've opened my eyes the more I have felt the beauty of it too. One of my counsellors convinced me it was all a part of the same thing, but I'd like to think he was wrong about the cause. I'd love it to be a spiritual cause, and I hope I can continue my path to it. Thankyou, I hope you're right!"

I don't want to be big or even make a lot of money and get a house, because I am just fine with how things are, but I know it's because I don't feel like it's real. Once this episode fades, then what? Will it be too late? Or will I always feel this way. Who knows. I do have a therapist but we can only speak on the phone until lockdown ends and my doctor's are shut, tried many medications for depression and anxiety but don't know if there really is a medication that would stop this"

Covid-19 doesn't discriminate, the Hollywood stars, politicians, the rich, the poor- nobody is immune. So we are all terrified. We can't ignore something than threatens us all in so many ways, so for many of us it causes anxiety and worry and worsening of dpdr symptoms, so I completely get it. Except for me somehow it's caused a reversal of feelings because I finally feel like maybe the way I saw the world before, wasn't skewed. The surreal-ness of the world right now matches the surrealness of how I saw the world before. But now more people seem to be seeing it that way, I am starting to be calmer, and feel more grounded.

Depersonalization,fjsc70y,t3_fevpof,1583595622.0,"Derealisation episodes can be terrifying because the world looks unfamiliar, distorted, unreal. Is that how it is with you? I get what you mean about sensory overload and being anxious when there are lots of people or loud noises but that can be due to a number of mental health conditions. With depersonalisation (the tag you posted in but it's easily confused, infact here in the UK they don't even use the term derealisation and just call it depersonalisation disorder or DPD for short, which still covers derealisation) it's like you don't recognise yourself or your actions or like you're viewing your body but feel disconnected to it. At least that's my view. Derealisation, on the other hand, for me is when the world seems skewed. I deal with depersonalisation a lot more than derealisation myself but when I suffer from a period of derealisation (which lasted a long time for me then seemed to dissapate for a while but occasionally makes a return on top of my depersonalisation), nothing looks right. I suddenly panic (especially the first time) and get paranoid that the world wasn't real. What if that ridiculous conspiracy that we are in a simulation is real? It went on for a while and I definitely suspected that I was going insane. I thought of ways to ""escape"" the simulation or beat it, but deep down I knew logically the world is real and that it's just my panic making me believe otherwise. But when I feel disconnected from the world I do still tend to see lights way brighter, particularly street lights, which to me seem 'fake' due to being artificial. It's like there's a sea of mist all around me and it's actually the most frustrating thing ever because it's not a vision thing it's my brain, so I want to rub my eyes and make it go away, but it doesn't. I try to see the buildings for what they are, but they look like they're too small or too tall. Where even am I? Am I real? Are my surroundings real? Why am I walking right now, like how did I know to get home, I wasn't thinking about it yet here I am. How do I know to walk when I'm not thinking about it? What are thoughts? Who am I? Etc. That's a bit of both. I can't say I miss the pure terror I first felt a full on DPDR episode but I'll never forget it, and it isn't gone yet. 

You might wanna talk through the symptoms see if you have it and can take it from there. There's no meds to directly tackle it but sometimes antidepressants help the cause. If you have underlying trauma that caused the disassociation between your mind and your body or your surroundings, then you're likely to need further counselling to dive in there. As hurtful as it can be. I'm guessing though as you mentioned that it's mainly the weed, so obviously steer clear of it as you've said, and ride it out. Drug induced DPD is often temporary, although the lingering feelings can make you feel like you have had it longer than you have.

Good luck and hope my input/story helped."

Paranoia,fjnyj6k,t3_fefrqc,1583516901.0,"I promise you this is so likely to be a hoax. I'm pretty sure sore throat isn't even a symptom of corona. Also mass hysteria is known to cause physical symptoms even in people who don't have anything wrong with them. It's dangerous of the media to be throwing this nonsense scaremongering out there. I completely understand your paranoia as I have similar paranoid episodes sometimes but if there's one thing I'd tell you is that this virus I am not paranoid about. If the 'kid' did end up having it (I think it's someone messing with you but if he's legit), his symptoms would worsen so there'd be no hiding it from his family, then they'd take the course of action that seems reasonable. Nothing you could have said or done differently that can change the outcome. The tone is inconsistent though I think they're some stupid child on the internet trying to scare or joke with people. If it spread it wouldn't be on you anyway, considering you can be a carrier for like 2 weeks before showing symptoms, so worst would have already been done. You did the right thing :)"
Depersonalization,fjmrxtk,t3_fdveu7,1583481280.0,"I assume you're in America? Look into DP/DR because it covers both depersonalisation and derealisation. We only call it Depersonalisation here in the UK apparently but if you're US then it defintately sounds like the de-realisation part of the disorder. From what I can gather, depersonalisation is feeling dissasociated/disconnected from your person, as if you're watching yourself from a distance doing and saying and even thinking things that you feel you have no control over, like you're watching yourself in a movie. It may lead to not recognising yourself in the mirror, and feeling like an outside observer of your own actions. It also leads to short term memory issues because when you dissassociate for a period of time you may kind of snap back into yourself and realise you're missing time. This has happened to me tons in the past year I actually worried I might have multiple personalities at one point because of how much time I lost. 

Derealisation is feeling disassociated/disconnected from your surroundings. (I think of it as de**person**alisation is in regards to your **person** and de**real**isation in regards to your **real**ity). Derealisation is looking at the world and not recognising it, or feeling like it isn't real. Objects and buildings and nature can be distorted, lights can be brighter, sounds can be louder or quieter. It can be really scary because you might panic and think you're not real, as if you're in a video game or simulation. A lot of people (including myself at first) can think they're going 'crazy.' 

It's estimated most of us will have at least one episode of DP/DR in our lives and it usually happens when we are in a fight or flight situation and our mind temporarily disassociates for a while in order to think and process what is happening so it can find an escape/way out. (Most people will have a period of dp/dr if they are trapped in a fire or car wreck). Problem is if you're in fight or flight mode but have no reason to be (for example you've suffered a great trauma that your mind is trying to process or you have extremely high anxiety that sends you into a panic), then you can get stuck with a DP/DR episode for days, weeks, months and for some people years. DP/DR disorder can also be drug induced, but may last for a long time after the drug is out of your system. (Most common after ingestion of LSD, Ketamine, and weed). 

So yeah, you might have symptoms of both, or one or the other. I've had both, unfortunately, although now it seems to be more limited to depersonalisation but it sounds like you may have had/are having an episode of derealisation (or both)."

depression,fjjgq9w,t1_fjjgh35,1583395293.0," Yeah looking back I think it was more of a severe anxious/depressive episode which lead to a paranoid episode.

I still am very disassociated from myself and my surroundings as a result of the DPD (equivalent to DPDR I think), but I'm working on it with a therapist.

Drugs,fjgvrwm,t3_fda0gd,1583336493.0,"Yup. And people will call you an addict whilst they drink themselves drunk every night. My friend at University decided I was too far gone and that she didn't hang out with ""addicts"" yet she drank at least a bottle of wine per night. LSD is considered a class A when all research points to it perhaps curing some mental illnesses. People will shove food down their gobs containing so much fat and sugar whilst telling you that you're a terrible person for experimenting with things that raise your dopamine- when the shit they're eating is doing the EXACT same thing. Drugs can have many side effects and lead to illness, but so can eating too much fat and consuming too much sugar. But that's acceptable because it's legal, and because the Government make money off it. They make money off our addiction to sugary/caffeinated drinks, but if we dabble with completely natural 'drugs' like LSD, shrooms, DMT, weed... it's completely wrong, because somebody decided having enjoyment off non-harmful natural ingredients shouldn't be allowed, so they ban it and force alcohol and nicotine and sugar down our throats because it'll keep us coming back for me, and probably cause health issues that allow them to give us 'solutions' to the problems they caused, which are even more expensive than the original habit.

Yes it is working I said it was slow not non-existent. I'm moreso arguing because I find it funny how redditors enjoy trying to prove you wrong and nitpicking everything you write instead of just providing the advice you ask for. People jump at the chance to make someone feel bad. ""Your metabolism must be fine because you lost weight by eating little"", basically trying to make me feel I am wrong for believing my metabolism is slow therefore I am just over eating. I know these mind games, but I definitely don't put any added thought into them. I know for a fact my metabolism is slower than average, the argument is just to see how far people will go to prove you wrong and make you feel bad. Thing is by eating very little I mean extremely minimal, I'm talking less than 500 cals a day, and burning upwards of 1500 whilst working. 

Anyway at least we got to the advice part, so thankyou, I will try and find a decent balance. Plus why are we picking up and making a massive deal out of the slow metabolism thing? You could have said your advice without all the added shit, even if you think you're right. I'd happily take that bet btw, easy money ;)

Thankyou appreciated bud"

But yes sometimes I don't see what she eats like if she goes out to eat or eats at her boyfriends or in her room or whatever, we aren't joined at the hip. But I know her eating habits like I would know my sister's if I still lived at home. She has a disability and mostly wears a leg brace so I know for a fact she doesn't go to the gym. She works at my place doing a different job. She may burn more than me though, depends on her metabolism. 

Thankyou, I will eat below maintenance and see how much I lose, if it's not too much that people will worry for me, then that's a good pace, if it's not enough I'll adjust accordingly as you say. Thanks! Yeah its definitely a struggle and I want to be healthier mentally and physically. :) X"

I'd rather it be healthy tbh, I've had issues with bingeing before and I feel like I've finally reset my body.

loseit,fitelcu,t1_fiie8kj,1582717280.0,"Well what I am saying is I lost 5lbs in a my first week back at my stocking job, which was a 6 day week. On my original post I mentioned that if I ate roughly 1184 calories a day I'd lose 2lbs per week. So eating a reasonable 1200 calories per day, even if I was not working, I'd effectively lose around those 2lbs. So I didn't lose an extra 4lbs from my stocking job, I lost an extra three.  3 x 3500 is 10,500, and I worked 6 days. So divide 10,500 by 6, that's 1750 calories I burned a day from my stocking job. That definitely seems right to me. Especially for my first week back on heavy duty aisles.

&#x200B;

And I don't expect it to be sustainable. I'm going to have to vary my calorie intake depending on what hours I work, because as much as I like losing 4-5lbs a week, I'm losing too much too fast now. Although, can't say I'm disappointed."
loseit,figcdd5,t1_fig6ew0,1582398141.0,"The only reason I'd become deficient in nutrients is if I wasn't eating properly, but food isn't the problem here. I agree about the muscle loss, but as a female muscle doesn't mean too much to be, however because my job is pulling, lifting etc, I think I am actually gaining muscle. Like I couldn't pick up half the stuff I can pick up now. My boss even puts me on the aisle he said he only has men do because it's heavy. Dunno if that's a good or a bad thing, lol. Protein shakes are a no for me, I can't stand the taste. Seems like a man thing anyway, to try and bulk up. I don't want to bulk up haha. I do take lunch to work which is usually a brown bread sandwich with ham and salad, with a side of more salad. I often buy a pack of crisps too because we get two breaks. I'm not that strict, I still eat unhealthy things. 

Yes, well, it kind of is like a gym! Especially on the aisles with heavier items. I was so burnt out this week I actually missed a shift by sleeping through it... that's what happens when you come back to work after two weeks off I guess!"

Yeah I've had to tell myself off a few times for picking up boxes the wrong way (not bending properly) out of laziness. Doesn't do wonders for the back! Ah I don't think that'll apply here, my weight is nothing but a hindrance at this job, I need the muscle but not the fat. Yep it does seem that way sometimes! Although sometimes they have be on self checkout tills which is the most boring job in the world, yet somehow the managers manage to get me to do a thousand other things whilst keeping an eye on them (the tills), so I guess that adds to my calories burnt too.

Nice to hear someone tell me I'm doing a good job and not telling me I'm losing weight too quickly, as far as I am concerned as long as I am eating over 1200 calories and healthily, with enough vitamins etc. then losing a few extra lbs here and there isn't bad.

loseit,fig8g9h,t1_fifzrwr,1582397107.0,"Yup, totally agree with number one. Like, if I really did not eat well during the day then my night shift would be hell, because I wouldn't have the energy. I know this because yes, sometimes I don't eat enough (say I sleep all day and then have a shift, I've basically not eaten anything, which is bad), and on those days I am so lethargic and I feel like I just can't lift another case or open another box. Luckily for the most part I have enough energy, and I always get my aisles done. I might tweak my diet slightly to involve higher calorie meals, just maybe on the weeks I am working a lot of hours, so my weightloss isn't so rapid. It's not even me that cares, it's everybody else, it seems! 

2) Yeah that is very true. My goal weight was picked by me thinking about how much more I want to lose. Even though between 8 and 10 stone seems to be the 'ideal' weight according to bmi, I only really plan on going down to 11 stone. That's 2 stone to go. I can't see myself losing more than that, I'm not built like that, skinny just would not suit me, lol. But yes. thankyou, I agree."

loseit,fifpnwv,t1_fifl6mz,1582392046.0,"How is 1200 too little? It's not unhealthy. As long as I don't go less than that. But it varies, I don't count my calories, if I do it's just to make sure I've eaten enough. 

Oh and believe me, you are so so wrong about the stocking. It is the biggest cause of my weightloss. I know this now as a fact because I recently had two weeks off. I ate the same things I'd eat on any working day, and stuck to my diet. Didn't do any exercise but did go out a few times. I lost 2lbs. In two weeks. First week back at work, i've lost 5lbs. It is a physically demanding job believe me. It's a huge grocery store and after dragging out 50 cages or so of delivery with a handful of workers and putting them onto relevant aisles. and then filling said aisles (after ripping open 100 boxes of packets of biscuits and putting them on whatever shelf they belong on, tell me it's light activity), it definitely is the reason for my weight loss. 

To be honest what I am doing now seems so natural. I'm not even trying. If I do try, it's to make sure I eat more rather than less. I did care about my weight and tried everything but nothing worked. But since adopting a healthier lifestyle without regular bingeing which was my usual go to, it's been easy. Then add work onto that, I actually have to try and eat more to equal it out. Which is difficult for me. Long term plans? No idea. My work schedule is inconsistent so where I might be working 48 hours one week the next week I might only be working 22 hours which is my contract. (Although that is highly irregular, I almost always work more than that). So it's hard to think long term, I know i'm losing weight too fast so I need to eat more, that's a given, I'm just going to struggle to up my cal intake without snacking or eating junk, which I don't want to do."
loseit,fifk1mc,t1_fifihr5,1582390550.0,"yeah I know but I just wanted to get a bigger picture of things, like why I am losing so much weight so rapidly. 

why is the step counting off by over 50%? When I'm doing 20,000+ steps a day I can see why I'm burning that much. If it is off by that amount, it must be the stocking that's causing me to lose more weight. 

I am losing roughly 4-5lbs a week That's great for now. But having to up my food intake is going to be a pain, because I've just gotten used to this 1200 calorie 'diet' to try and lose 2lbs a week. I didn't take into account the calories I am burning by working."

I was kind of forced by my school to pick a degree and go to university, I'd much rather have done other things first to decide what I enjoyed doing, because I was rushed into it and my teachers pushed me to do fashion. I scraped by at uni but now I hate the fashion industry and all it stands for, and it's impossible for me to do anything with this shit degree, so for me I am a bit more stuck than OP. But I totally believe OP can go far and have a job they enjoy as long as they keep trying and don't give up. I was probably projecting lol. As well as noticing all the people my age who hate their jobs but get by anyway. I do feel as though that's how it is for most. Just the way it is."

It is just difficult in a world that requires a degree to get a career and all the careers I am now interested in need a degree, so I feel stuck. However, for OP things might go well, the degree in Business and English can lead to many careers, but I still think OP is right and most of the time the career is just a job they don't really like but have to do to earn money to live. But it's better than nothing. Or OP could really shine and get a job they love and earn loads and get to retire early in a big house with a fancy car. That's most people's goals. My goal is to just enjoy what I do and have enough to live comfortably and help others, like going to different countries to give aid or do social or care work. But I can't even do that. I can't even earn enough to help people. How shit is that? 

Well done on your success. I am glad you have a job you are proud of. As I say, it's not impossible, it's just difficult. Because some people still dislike their jobs even if it earns a decent amount. Cause as OP says, you don't even have the spare time to do anything. What's the point in having the money?

And I was being general, some people shine and go forward and have a brilliant life and I fully support you to be positive and beat the system and have a job they enjoy. It can be done for sure.

I have tried to escape it of course, but I've fallen out of love with fashion completely so my degree is useless, and I have no discernable talents. I did well at school but because of my chosen path I can't do much with those good grades because most careers require a degree, at least the careers I'd like to go into. I've thought about helping people in some way like social work or care work but I have anxiety which really limits what I can do. You could be right but I stock shelves and mostly my boss doesn't even know where to put me, so I doubt it'll lead anywhere. I haven't given up, but I do stand by my idea that life sucks lol. Seems as though you succeed or you don't, and if you don't, you get stuck with a job you don't like until you can retire and even then by the time we can retire we probably won't have much to live off for the short time we have left/ I'm being realistic rather than pessimistic. But you have a good chance still. It doesn't HAVE to be that way, not for everyone. 

Go forth and believe in yourself! You have a lot of choice with your degree, so have a good think and keep smiling :) Like you said, it's about doing everything that you can to make life suck less."

Like after a 7 day working week I'd lost 5lbs, which is a lot. It was all the work as well as the fact I'd barely eaten. I felt run down, sluggish, out of energy, just horrible. It wasn't on purpose, just all that work meant sleeping more and less able to eat. He was pleased for me, although I told him that kind of weight loss is not sustainable, it's not good for you, 2 maybe 3lbs would be okay. He disagreed and said think about how much I could lose if I kept going at that rate. Annoyed me so much. He doesn't care about health at all. To him it's like fat= unhealthy less fat= healthy, which is why he sees nothing wrong with eating 2 burgers and 2 fries, or 3 muffins, or 2 bags of crisps and three chocolate bars all at once. I've tried to educate him but it's like he has tunnel vision. 

Yeah I kind of get what you mean there and it was good you had a conversation, I might do the same, although it's definitely a different circumstance, because he doesn't care about my health, just for some reason is obsessed with other peoples weight loss, and his own weight gain. Actually now I think about it, it probably has a lot more to do with him than it does with me. Like he's unhappy with his weight (being too skinny) so projects it onto me? Could be.

Yeah I agree I think a conversation is best. I recently went on a two week break from work so when I go back I'll be in the right headspace to do that, especially as just before I left for the 2 weeks my one friend said ""make sure you eat properly"" (because for some reason people have nothing better to do at work than gossip so my weightloss has become a topic of discussion, with a couple people being worried I'm not looking after myself/eating enough including one of my managers) so the friend in question responds ""yeah, like, not too much"" So I just had a shocked look on my face and he's all like ""you know cause you've done good, just don't eat a lot because you might put on weight"" and i just walked off and said I can't even reply to that. So I think going back it will be the perfect time to have that discussion with him. Thanks I appreciate the advice a lot! I hope we can keep the friendship just with him not making anymore comments that make me not wanna eat.

Really bugs me that he keeps an eye on what I am eating but if he didn't have such a fast metabolism he'd be way bigger than I am. I've told him that, he just says I should be glad I don't lose weight quickly. Maybe he's projecting because he used to be heavier (as in muscles, he used to go to the gym a lot and drink protein shakes and all that, now cause of work he rarely gets to). I dunno. It upsets me because I want to eat without being judged by what I eat. Especially now I am at a weight that I am happier with.

Oh yeah, just before I went on holiday one friend said ""make sure you eat properly"", because a few ppl at work have noticed my weightloss and have asked if I am looking after myself, but then that guy said ""yeah like not too much"" and I just wen't ""what?"" and he said ""like don't overeat because you wont have work to help you not eat as much, you look good now but you don't want to gain more"" and it ticked me off.

He upset me when we went to mcdonalds once on our break because he said ""I thought you were on a diet"" which I never even said, so I haven't been eating with them since. I do admit that affected me so my weight loss has become faster over the past couple of months. SO yes, it has accelerated, but minimally. I am still losing at a normal rate and in 6 months 2 stone is healthy to lose. I think because I have moved out she cannot see what I eat which worries her, as well as the fact that I struggle to make myself food (possible adhd, makes it difficult), but I seem to be managing. My mother is losing weight and has lost A LOT over the last year, after joining slimming world with me (I don't do it anymore), but yes she is struggling to lose more and that may be a factor. She has always been ashamed of her body weight as have I, but she feels so much better, except now that she cannot lose what she wants. But no, haha, I am 23 and eat appropriately.

If she truly believes I am slimmer than her when she is a stone lighter, maybe it's her brain not processing peoples weight correctly, kind of like a body dysmorphia? I dunno. I think because she is smaller than me she sees herself as bigger, or because my fat might be in different places that are less visible. I do try to wear things that make myself look slimmer, so that could be it.

True, I don't know who will tell her that thought, but I will assert myself more rather than passively trying to use science and bmi and that to try and show her. It's just science. I am bigger than she is. I am overweight, I will continue to lose weight at a healthy rate. That might stop the worry for a while."
