However recently my episodes have been rather mild like compared to last year there was only one major episode lasting like three weeks (but it was a bad one as I described in the post) the rest was just mild depression (maybe compared to depression last year everything is mild, I was getting delusional but not full on psychotic and felt like the world was fake and I was destined to die) and stuff, so I don't know if I even need to be on medication or if this is just me beliving I do. I'll try to directly ask my therapist what they think about a pdoc appointment and my diagnosis in general, maybe print my emoods chart when I see one."

And yeah I get the guilt part about therapy, for me it comes from having been to therapy for two years and feeling like not making enough progress, but I think it's unfair to put all blame on yourself. Waitlists often serve as a way to filter out mild disorders that get better without help, anyone who struggles badly will hopefully get some immediate ressources. 

And yeah the worst part is that these insults also can exaggerate how we feel about ourselves, I guess I'd try to speak to more supportive people whenever possible and to identify extreme emotional responses as such.

And I'm actually sorry I can't give you advice regarding concrete ressources, no need to thank me specifically I'm sure many people are willing to support you. It might be that after some time we stop writing, but it doesn't mean people don't care. Reddit can be hit or miss like on some subs posts can just go unread or receive many comments, that's why having more responsible ressources in your life is so valuable (beside them being able to provide you help & coping methods with your actual problems)."

Regarding your doctor: It is possible he would react badly, I don't know him. However, I promise your doctor is very used to people not following his advice. Like many people don't take their medicines (of all kinds e.g. blood pressure medication), or apply lifestyle changes, or perform exercises, or rest long enough after an illness and go back to work earlier. (The list goes on and on.) You have a valid concern and it would definitely not be a waste of your doctors time. Also is your referral that you cancelled still valid by any chance? (In my country the referral is for the insurance and valid for one year, the place you are referred to could schedule you new appointments at any time if you still have a valid referral.)

Either case I also have telephone anxiety but you don't have to impress anyone when you call a doctor, especially if it is for your mental health. As long as they understand what you say and you manage to say what you mean, it will do.

Lastly I am so sorry your mother reacts that way. I get told I am lazy a lot too when I am trying hard to get up and it really triggers me every time super badly. I hope you realize it's not true. Anxiety and depression can slow your brain so much it becomes near impossible to function at all, anyone who's experienced it badly will congratulate you it you manage to get out of the bed. Many people don't or don't want to understand it. I am glad your dad is supportive and again I hope you manage to recover and get the help you need.

It might be a good idea to reach out to your doctor again about this too, they could refer you or prescribe something.

I think it's perfectly fine if you do show emotions at work, because ultimately the residents are also humans and if everyone is a robot they will feel estranged. But you totally deserve to be stable again, these are like two different things."
ADHD,fp20n6r,t3_gaauny,1588252600.0,"I'm no expert but here's more or less my approach: (might be too late for this task, but next time maybe)

Make a list of what to include. If you have post its write one topic on each otherwise use a single paper (messing with scissors and glue would use too much time I promise), then arrange them or number them as you want to mention them in the report.

Then on your computer write a couple sentences for each topic and cross out your post its or list entries when you are done with each. Write like when you just want the job get done and don't focus on making it good.

My goal when speed writing is to get something bad which would technically meet the requirements ASAP and then work on proof reading & improving it as you go. However if you need citations etc it's important to correctly set up your software from the beginning or you will lose valuable time.

Also use pomodoro technique."

If talk therapy is not an effective option for you, then maybe art therapy is. Sadly it's hard to get insurances to pay for it, but I know people personally who had success with it.

For us stuck in the current time, we have to deal with the uncertainty and either take the risk or not. Both choices have pros and cons. In my case I reacted badly, but I also knew I had hypomanic episodes in addition to my depression for a long time, and it wasn't properly assessed by this prescriber, but I moved along with it because I literally saw no other way. Basically what I'm trying to say is discuss your doubts honestly with your prescriber and they might give you what they think will most likely help you most.

For me it was a nightmare, but a short lived one compared to my issues so I don't regret trying it. It depends on what position you are in (like if you are suicidal or prone to such thoughts, or if it matters a lot to be sexually functional I think everyone comes to their own conclusions) and I would totally understand if with the current pandemic you are extra cautious.

If you have been through discouraging life events it might be that you are stronger now than back when it happened. I don't mean the bullshit like bad things are good because they make us stronger, I just mean that under the same circumstances nowadays we would know more options. Bullying used to make me suicidal and it probably would still trigger me, but if people were to get to that level again I wouldn't let it destroy me, I would just walk away and report their behavior if that is possible.

The place I used to go for therapy basically conflated hypomania with mania and said I don't have mania so I don't have bipolar. Despite knowing I've had episodes since I'm 12. And I go read like the DSM or wikipedia and it says something different.

But to be fair, my previous therapist suggested ADHD but didn't diagnose me and my new treatment team still hasn't figured out the differential diagnosis ADHD/BD yet. I wouldn't be surprised if it's both, how do you even find a specialist for both? As it looks there are specialists for each individual disorder but nobody who knows both.

I hate feeling so ambivalent about everything and it's driving me crazy for good, but I think at least for me like the other commenter pointed out, a lack of stability might be key here. Like of course we don't have a direction if our minds are in constant flux leading to positions that contradict eachother.

I still don't have an alternative for when I am not able to leave my room or bed though (like chilli bonbons but I don't have any, I guess one could snack pepper but good luck with that). If it works it's quite a relief to know you succeed to cope.

I agree with the other comment that you should also get in touch with your pdoc about this ASAP and see what they can do for you, don't wait before it becomes even more extreme.

Thanks for sharing your experience, it gives me some hope, and sounds like the kind of stability worth to strive for.

Anyhow, I'm so sorry for your loss. I don't have wise words or advice, but if you ever want to talk about it (or other things for that matter) feel free to PM me (but I don't check chat a lot).

Basically, they are all in denial about having some issues though, and take personal offence if I were to have something because then suddenly they might be confronted with their own issues. Or idk, that's how I try to understand it. I can be in bed for months and they will still think that everything is fine, also they didn't notice my most severe depressive episodes?

Re therapy I'm going to decide once this lockdown is over, unless I go depressed before then again, I don't know how you do it but I think hiding therapy from your mother must be hard to do during these times because it's mainly what's made me stop otherwise I'd been fine with etherapy (like them literally hearing me speak is a problem)... I actually want to first see the specialist for ADHD also, like 3 years in therapy with different people I'd say they should know what I have but it seems they are as puzzled as I am or everyone found a different issue, but I feel like I might have failed to improve a lot of the time because I'm so disorganized and I'm just puzzled how no therapist stopped me like I even mentioned it sometimes.

Routine is probably a keyword I need to stress more, like getting up at the same time every day, etc. It's hard to stick with it during depression, but doing that for a couple weeks often helps a lot.

The problem with my doctor is that my psychiatrist is not available at this time due to other circumstances, there's someone I have never seen before whom I could have seen (or maybe talk to on the phone), but my therapist was like if I don't do online sessions with them then I should also cancel the pdoc appointment because that doesn't make sense (and I don't want to do have online sessions like they want it to, because I can't speak about therapy stuff at home with my family around 24/7), and now I'm not sure if I trust any of them to really handle my issues anymore since I feel almost dropped by them but it's not like it's a good time to go look for another doctor and also I would have to see my GP again after they did all the testing and labs to finally get on medicine, so I'm thinking of quitting psychiatry for good but I'm also aware that this is not really an option for me but it's just everything too much."

I would question how much more obvious these things are with you than the average joe, and whether you really wouldn't be able to learn to mask it more by training scenarios. Like others definitely get bored too and it usually shows, but maybe you end up not noticing this as much as when it happens to you? I often feel like a complete freak about to have a meltdown because I dropped a fork in the cafeteria, then my extrovert colleague has a presentation and trembles and I'm like damn dude I am the shy avoidant one always causing awkward moments for everyone but I'd be more calm than you in that specific situation.

That aside, maybe it's going to be a problem in this specific job. But in an other one it might not be the obstacle you see it as. (For example going from in person customer service, to online maybe email.) There's no reason it would prevent you from becoming a manager specifically, but it can be hard to get there to begin with like not everyone who wants to get there gets there and it's not a reason to beat yourself up.

Finally. Some people actually really dig people who show their feelings, it's a bit like moderate shiness being attractive to some except that this one isn't even so problematic in the every day life and it can be an actually good quality to be real. 

I'm not sure why you are losing your friends, but I have similar issues although I wouldn't blame it so much on showing emotions too obviously. Friendships shouldn't have to be a pretend game to begin with, but I know how freaking hard maintaining them can be to begin with.

If you want to have a relationship you will have to face the fear of being liked back. Of all the valid reasons you struggle with it, this is the one I wouldn't let you hinder from it. Maybe it wouldn't even feel as scary as it seems, because it's actually a good thing. (This is me looking for a research project, scared I'll have to do a video chat about a topic to a T. I am so scared that I won't be able to talk about it properly etc, like my fear is mainly failing to perform. Maybe in the context of a relationship you fear being a failure there too?)

Anyway, I am not sure if I was just being offensive or not making any sense, but I get your feeling of frustration reading your post. Multiple big problems that can't be resolved over night and the rumination about them can be extremely taxing. I was wondering if you tried CBT before? I'm not a therapist but from my own experience it seems that just in this post there are many thoughts which fuel your frustration. (I'm not yet at the point where I learn to think in less harmful ways yet though, I have no clue if it actually works but the science says it works.)"

Fragen zum nachdenken:

Hast du je was gern getan oder dich worüber so richtig gefreut, einen guten freund oder freundin gehabt, oder was hingekriegt auf das du dann stolz warst?

Gibt es Dinge die du gerne hättest, aber du denkst, du wirst sie nie haben? Oder dinge wo du hoffst, sie würden dir spass machen aber sie tun es nicht?"

I think the two sides to it are:

1. What do you want?
2. What do you fear?

If you can answer these clearly for yourself, it can give you some sense of comfort facing your obsessions. And a third question would be if you want to get on PrEP or not? Decide it for yourself, or talk to a specialized doctor. It's not necessary if he actually is undetectable (so no need to tax your body with medications), but I think I would want to see a partner's test results and medication compliance.

On a side note, in a sense this also (combined with the current pandemic) is a brutal exposure therapy, if you can cope with this without endulging in compulsions you'll already be a lot further in recovery."
Schizoid,flwoox4,t3_frl9zq,1585558915.0,"Hi. I never received a formal diagnosis, but personally I think I have AvPD and BPD, to some extent I also find descriptions of Schizoid PD even more fitting for my issues (mainly the older ones where they do point to the internal ambivalence about wanting but also rejecting closeness to other people, like I know I am not meant to be around others and wouldn't like it but I also really want to have a partner which I also never had in my life btw).

It has happened before that I started obsessing over someone I started liking and that can easily end with me getting intrusive thoughts of self harm and suicide partially fueled by sudden bursts of self hatred. Also, I split on people... But it feels like most of it is awakened at certain times in my life, inbetween I go indifferent and numb for months. Not sure what is my personality, and what is depression.

If you go on BPD forums you might want to search for quiet BPD (or qBPD sometimes). Maybe you should look for individual DBT or a different therapy, until you're with someone (if you even want that)? Or try to absorb the parts of DBT which are relevant for you, like skills for instability, dissociation, etc. I've been trying therapy for a couple of years but I haven't managed to break the social isolation or lack of participation in life yet, if anything I have become even more withdrawn, so I really don't know what would be best for us.

I've personally found valerian tablets (I got ones with hops too, but I would suspect those with lemon balm too would also be good) helpful to quiet my brain down a bit, or passiflora incarnata if I need a strong anxiolytic (however it is a GABAergic drug and I personally feel it's something one shouldn't use too much, but it's also one of the strongest herbs I tried). Not in the context of SSRI withdrawal, but I think these are good options to consider with a herbalist and relatively well studied. (Plants never get the same amount of research as synthetic drugs.)

You mustn't mix zoloft with hypericum perforatum (serotonine syndrome) which is included in some herbal combinations, and personally I disagree with the author of the PDF and am cautious about not using rhodiola rosea together with something serotonergic. (They point out a problematic case report.)

I saw in another comment that you also take pain killers and antihistamines. If the latter is for allergy I completely understand, but otherwise I'd make sure it's one which doesn't mess with your brain further or try to replace it. And for migraine, have you tried golden milk? I know it's a bit of a hipster thing, but it really helps me when I have milder symptoms (main ingredients are plenty turmeric and a bit of pepper, plus warm (soy) milk).

I am not really worried about the danger of self medicating but it might simply not be strong enough, and also I guess I am not supposed to tell this to psychiatrists or else they would not prescribe ADHD meds to me anymore.

I never considered the fact that CYP inhibition (I think you meant CYP3A4) would affect testosterone metabolism but obviously this makes sense. Since I never got a doctor to check my testosterone levels laking hypogonadyism symptoms I won't know if it is relevant for me.

I have decided to switch to RR instead of SJW, or taking them both together (it's not clear to me for sure what effects they have on monoamines), and take it continuously at my lowest effective dose. Given how it's almost impossible to see a doctor for something other than COVID right now, I am being extra safe with a wash out period.

Yesterday you also commented something about inflammation, I find it very interesting because after taking it for a couple months SJW subjectively exhibited a pro inflammatory effect in me like I got some kind of stable rash/acne on my back when taking it and a surgery wound kept hurting, it reduced my migraines though so maybe it was also more of an allergy.

My coping strategies:

* make good playlists, find new things if you have the time
* work on something you consider important or interesting (listen to music for additional distraction)
* go on walks alone while it's still allowed in your area, chill in nature or listen to music, it's hard to find a place without people but it's still better with more space between people
* think about what your plans for the future are, like which things you actually care about, maybe you find ways how to work towards it already now (which could help you cope with the current situation)
* relaxation exercises (they can seem stupid, but sometimes it helps me)
* tea, in particular calming herbal teas like lemon balm

Also I am wondering if this is my personality or ADHD and not actual hypomania, like if I went to either specialist they would probably diagnose me with both and give me completely different medications. Like, if it weren't for the depression, I don't think anyone would consider my ups as pathological.

I'm glad the seroquel works for you! I'm open to take it during a bad episode, but I personally am not willing to take it long term because I'm kind of scared of it, but I don't mean to discourage you.

bipolar2,fl0nja8,t1_fkz48ya,1584711405.0,"Thanks for your reply. You're welcome, I just said it's a vent so nobody has to feel compelled to reply. Actually I can't think straight today because I feel so low, so it's possible I won't make sense. (And I really should go for a walk while it's still legal to do so.)

My first question would be whether you have found any of the bipolar medications actually improved your cognition? I'm so scared of them, because besides most having the ability to kill or fuck your body up, they also make some people even more dull. Today I was supposed to have an appointment with a psychiatrist specializing in mood disorders, but it got cancelled because of the current situation.

I still think that recurrent unipolar depression plus ADHD would be a valid explanation for my issues too, like if you have actual mania it's not such a complicated diagnostic issue, but whether it's hypomania or something else is the main problem. I kind of feel like I know it's hypomania though, I was still a child when I read about bipolar and I felt like this is me to a T, nowadays it's much more of a mess and I feel like I never get the ""hypomania"" I knew back then. Also I think BPD would make a lot of sense, but I actually have AvPD so it doesn't overtly show until I try to get with someone and almost fall apart completely in the process, but I do stuff like splitting (and it's funny you say that thing about psychiatrists making me feel uncomfortable, because it happens almost every time when I start to realize they are focusing on something which I don't even think is such a big issue).

If you go to a psychiatrist how do you even trust their diagnosis? Everyone I've seen says something different... If they say bipolar, how do I know it's not BPD after all? Or ADHD, if it is ADHD they would give me a stimulant but with the others they would say it's bad for me, and one doctor could say I have one of these while the other would say it's just anxiety and  I need an antidepressant. And you're right about going in with notes, I never manage to really focus on what I really want to say. (Thanks to cognition issues.)

Also I'm sorry it took you so long to get the right diagnosis, I don't know why it has to be such a long ride, but apparently with bipolar it's more the norm than the exception.

Today I had a brief break moment from depression, like I just went back afterwards, but I recalled when I went to Kyoto alone and it how beautiful the city was. Obviously, I didn't experience everything to the fullest because of some issues, but I actually enjoyed it a lot and want to go there again. Another thought, the guy I went on two dates with last summer. (I liked the guy but the dates were terrible.) These thoughts came when I tried to sleep again in the morning because I was too low, and usually I cannot recall good things at all, it's been such a weird thought like I always think my life hasn't begun yet because all I do is waste away and I cannot recall a single good memory when I try to, but there's actually parts of my life where I felt alive. It makes me wonder what's happened to become like I am now, how can I feel so dead but also so alive, how can that still be me? It doesn't feel like me at all, but I know it is.

(And oh gosh to going psychotic from antidepressants. For me it's the other way around, when I feel up I'm a bit irrational sometimes, you know funny ideas everywhere and lose thinking, but I only get psychosis-like symptoms (obsessions/delusions, paranoia) when depressed. So far I haven't taken a strong antidepressant for a prolongued time though, I felt like St. John's wort made me rapid cycle before but I also do that without.)"
BipolarReddit,fkz3r23,t1_fkyz5me,1584662119.0,"Yeah it's still a long way to recovery.

Between episodes I often downplay how bad episodes can be, I only realize it when I'm already going into depression again how bad it can get. That said, I think with bipolar you sort of become a veteran of mood episodes. Yes the frustration of living like this can get worse with time (and I don't know how to solve this problem either), and every time it can get arbitrarily bad, but if you're around now you have survived every of your episodes so far. You also survived a bad infection. I wish you all the best recovery from it and that the follow up appointments go well, and maybe being very serious about the virus when going outside eventually isn't necessarily a bad idea (like wearing mask, disposable gloves, keeping distance to other people)."

If your main issues like mine are things that cannot be adressed right now (basically I have been self quarantining all my life) then maybe it really will not do much to have therapy now, this was my reasoning, but a skype session would definitely be more like a normal session than the telephone.

Doctors didn't even test me in the hospital for it, but the nurses were really worried. It probably wasn't near as serious as your condition, but it still felt like I was about to die.

If they sectioned a part of the hospital, they are hopefully taking the virus seriously and will do what they can to prevent it from spreading to your room. It could happen, but I really hope things go right for once and you don't get it. Limit the number of people you see when you get home and make sure to take precautions.

I don't know if ordering food is an option in your area or if they are out of stock or too busy too. But if it is possible maybe it might be the most accessible way to get food.

I hope you get well soon, and that you don't get an episode. I guess you can try to be mindful and remain in the present, think about today and not too much about the future. (Although if it helps you figure out what you want from life go ahead.) Given what is happening to you, even people without BD would be struggling very hard."

BPD,fkk0rnz,t3_fiysf1,1584268598.0,"If you are going there for therapy, I'd say most likely they will first have an intake appointment anyhow. It's not as much a waste of time as it might seem like, because it's very important to discuss in detail what you want out of therapy and see if they can provide you with that and also get this person to understand your current situation.

How often will you have appointments? If it's weekly personally I'd probably go alone to the first one, and ask about how you could involve your boyfriend in therapy. Or, if you think it would be better maybe you could still reach out and ask if it's a possibility for the first appointment?

If you are trying to go on with your life, then I think it personally helps me the most to imagine that it doesn't really make a big difference to others if I go outside or not, because others will do so nevertheless, if something should really change, then the government would have to place a curfew and not just give advice.

I think avoiding physical visits to your parents is a sensible precaution, if they have video chat maybe you can still remain in touch like that with them for the time being.

OCD,fk3p0g8,t3_fg56k3,1583842177.0,"I'm in a an area with many new infections, and I didn't have symptoms this severe for a long time but it got so bad that I'm now reading 4-6h a day about the virus. I need to stop but I can't I'm literally unable to study at all (also due to depression).

I'm in the exactly the same situation as you, I had a cold two and a half weeks ago and still have a cough, and I'm about to see my therapist now. For that I have to commute with public transport and I can't stop worrying that I could actually have the virus and spread it to my therapist or some stranger in the public transport. And if health care workers got sick because of me, that would be so bad. Like in addition to infecting someone, what if someone kills themself because they lost their support at a critical time or their doctor can't take care of their heart? But also anyone else. Our government does not do enough so the virus will spread anyhow, I feel like I'm losing it because I can't be sure others won't die or become severely harmed because of me. I get this fear often, but now it's a lot more real and I can't fight with it anymore.

Hell even when I have a cold I usually stay at home because I don't want others to have a cold, everyone else around me goes to work even with influenza but I'm just like fuck I'm sick I need to isolate, but a lingering cough... In the case of a cold it should actually not be contagious, but I guess you get that fear that it might be SARS-2-CoV. 

I don't really care about what will happen to me, I think that's my depression, but I'm so scared about hurting others.

Are you self isolating now? Or trying to move along with life? I don't have advice but I totally relate, I think the probability that someone who would not get it will get it because of you is probably pretty low and if they go outside they are taking a far greater risk of getting the virus because they will likely be around many people, but this uncertainty is debilitating."
depression,fjz0y4q,t1_fjxp32m,1583708874.0,"Please try to find a new psychiatrist or therapist soon. It's probably going to be very hard to open up again after this one, but there ought to be someone who cares. He was extremely unprofessional and I agree that it would warrant reporting, so this doesn't happen to others. I'm not sure if he was allowed to tell your parents, but I'm not familiar with law.

I also have a long history of bullying, and I'm only starting to really grasp the extent of it almost a decade later, I wish I had gotten help earlier.

Also you might have better luck with psychological therapists, in my experience they can be better equipped to handle bullying and trauma. (However you definitely shouldn't write off psychiatrists because of this one, there are great doctors out there too.)"
depression,fjs0w5q,t3_fetxcw,1583592469.0,"Well first of all I think if you can get therapy, that would be worth to look into and a good way to have support longer term.

In the meantime you can lookup ""dbt skills"" basically the idea is that while self injury might provide some relief there are also other ways that could give you equivalent relief without self harming.

For example I find cold water helps. The basic version is running cold water over your wrists for a while (this is more for when you don't feel enough), but you can also dip your face in it or my favorite for when things get extreme rinse my face with ice cold water in the shower. 

But you can also get stuff like chilli candies etc, as said look up dbt skills there are a lot of things which are more BPD related but there's a huge number of self harm alternatives worth trying out. Some people prepare an ""emergency box"" so for when you feel the urge, you have the different alternatives ready."

China_Flu,fjjusxb,t1_fjjh9tp,1583412810.0,">just have to destroy virus you already have in your body

A virus in your body replicates itself until the immune system gets a handle on the infection (basically when it gets angry enough) and it kills the virus faster than it can replicate. At least very roughly, but I'm sure an actual expert could explain how this is a huge simplification or even wrong.

I think the bigger factor is the stress and physical exhaustion, plus the chances that the immune system fails to control a new virus."

>We take the connection we can get because we don't think we deserve the real deal.

And yeah that's largely it. I find this also explains why it mostly happens when the loneliness becomes so overwhelming that it physically hurts. Too fucked up to interact with people for real, so I turn to what I know I can actually do. I also often wonder if there's a self harm aspect to it as you mention, I don't physically self harm but I feel a lot of what goes through me is similar to what others experience when they do.

Maybe it's for the better I'm scared of hookups with strangers, I could totally see how that would become problematic for me easily too. (And not to mention the ever growing number of cases of STDs.)

And thanks for your recommendation, I really need to watch these TED talks. I also have some sort of daddy issues, but not as much as I used to. I think knowing what you really want is already a big step towards a healthy sexuality and relationship, but getting there can be so hard.

BPD,fjeobjy,t3_fcwejv,1583275463.0,"There's some nuance to it, like saying someone's too nice or similarly positive qualities just means ""I wouldn't have been as forgiving as you in this instance"" and not necessarily that you are wrong but is more of an observation that the speaker is different from you. Even this can feel patronizing or invalidating, but I feel like it usually doesn't come with bad intent.

On the other hand, shit that directly criticizes some hypothetical weakness of you (e.g. you're too quiet), in my opinion is incredibly rude and a sign of a lack of empathy. When that happens I usually cut ties with these people if it's possible. I feel like many other people just don't even get the criticism I get, so they don't get to deal with it either. (Also my reaction isn't healthy either, but I can't be bothered with bullshit.)

Also it hurts even more when it's about a thing that bothers you a lot, like people further fuel the fire, but you still don't know how to fix it. Like it doesn't fit into that sentence structure, but when people tell me I don't socialize enough, I die inside."
BPD,fja5wr2,t3_fc1lux,1583167042.0,"I have never been on a mood stabilizer, but personally found a key factor in stabilizing my mood is to have sufficient and very regular sleep. If there's any irregularity try to tackle it.

I'm not sure if you were supposed to go off your medication and how bad the side effects were, but in any case take care. If you start to feel worse maybe it's better to see a doctor anyhow, I know talking to psychiatrists you don't know can be quite hard (like they make me split/cry level) but it might still be better than not to. Also maybe if someone works in the same office they could offer you sliding scale too, but yeah I really don't know about that.

I had a quick look at your post history to see if you posted which medication and how long, but I didn't see anything. I can't give medical advice anyhow, but some mood stabilizers (and in particular non-traditional stabilizers like neuroleptics) can have strong sedative effects and essentially zap your anxiety away, but once you go off them it can return and be awful while your brain is readjusting."

antidepressants,fix8cad,t1_firnxkh,1582815039.0,"I'm sorry you have to deal with this fucked up health care system. I wish you could get the therapy you need and maybe you should look into the free options the other commenter suggested. In my opinion therapists don't want to drug you up, but mainly offer it as a suggestion. Same with good psychiatrists, my current one is not insisting that I have to take anything. (But that also means they put a part of the responsibility on me.)

You can get sertraline for extremely cheap (but the liquid form I mentioned is expensive), and you don't need a psychiatrist, even a family doctor (or in some cases although I'm not so familar with the system an NP) could prescribe it to you and since it's not a controlled substance usually you don't have to see a doctor often for it. Same for trileptal except that I think it is a bit more expensive, but I'm sure if that's the problem you will figure it out by then.

>if I end up permanently sexually dysfunctional and/or Anhedonic and/or  emotionless, I’m probably going to commit suicide, since there’s no  actual cure or treatment, and if I stay alive, I’ll only be alive in the  biological sense.

I completely understand you on this. Nobody wants to live like that! I do think it's very unlikely that it will persist for all your life, but you might still experience it for some time after going off your medication or you might still have depression. In the case that you do end up experience this, you might still want to explore going back to medication temporarily but maybe on something that will actually help you. Trileptal is a mood stabilizer, that can be great if you have bipolar, but it can also limit your emotional range and make you feel flat (and some people even report this from just sertraline). Still I think it might actually help make the tapering of sertraline more bearable, although I'm no expert!

22 months is more than enough time to taper. Basically you could taper a lot faster than that, but if you do experience bigger issues, then its better to slow down.

The only issue I see is your social situation. Going off medication is obviously stressing you out even just thinking about, I don't think the risks are as likely as you make it sound. I had a smaller surgery last year, but still feel a bit of a side effect of that, it sucks. And basically yes you're betting a lot when you undergo a surgery, but still sometimes it's the best option. Same with medication changes. Of course there are risks, know why to do it and get assistance where you can. Because the one thing that worries me the most is that you mention suicide as the result. I really hope it's more the anxious kind of suicidal thought I know, where you actually fear the death too, because yes there are better ways to deal with anything that comes along your way. I'm a tiny bit younger than you, going through your twenties with a psychological disorder sucks, but as you go you learn to make the best out of it and really they can decrease in severity (I guess full remission is often a bit utopic, but many people fully recover although I'm not in that club)."
