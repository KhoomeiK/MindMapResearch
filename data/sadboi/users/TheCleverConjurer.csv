1. Communication.
This is absolutely key to relationship health. Communicate about virtually everything, good or bad. Let your partner know you care and are listening early and often. If you're upset with them talk it out so it doesn't fester. Talk out your day, your hobbies, your dumb gossip...just keep the lines of communication open and clear always.

2. Pick your battles.
Your partner will do things you don't like. When you move in together all those little flaws become obvious and it's your job to decide which you can live with and which ones you need or would like them to change or compromise on. For instance: My husband never puts the pots and pans away where they belong. No matter how many times I remind him he forgets. It's a little thing that drove me crazy, but I realized I would rather be 60 and rearranging pots than 60 and without his smile, so I stopped complaining and accept it as a quirk of our relationship.
