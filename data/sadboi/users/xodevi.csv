JoshuaTree,fop4zfb,t3_g85dzn,1587953199.0,"I may have seen that or something very similar at Coyote Corner. They are a local business and could really use the support right now. I don’t see posters listed on their website; however, you could probably write them there or on Instagram. Good Luck :)"
JoshuaTree,fop3dbe,t3_g88pbm,1587952181.0,"After “Stay at Home” orders are lifted so as not to encourage tourism and the spread of infection to residents.
San Bernardino County orders are “in effect until rescinded.”
Let’s say an optimistic June 1st."
BipolarReddit,fnuotri,t3_g3nmy2,1587267290.0,"Some people have PMDD (ultra severe PMS) which can look like and be misdiagnosed as bipolar. Likewise, I have a bipolar friend who was originally misdiagnosed as PMDD. It doesn’t sound like PMDD is a factor for your friend, but we never know someone’s struggles. Lord knows, our struggles can’t be understood completely by someone who hasn’t been there!"
BipolarReddit,fnhjerj,t3_g1s0ge,1586963508.0,"So sorry to hear you are going through this. Losing sleep really messes with the brain. Sounds like you already have a sleeping pill? If not, can you get a prescription or over the counter? Anything to get you sleep! I know the feeling. Sending healing thoughts and energy your way."
BipolarReddit,fn8jgct,t3_g01e87,1586743039.0,"I have been titrating up on Lamictal. I’m currently at 150 mg. I had severe insomnia and sleep disturbances once I got to this dosage. Lack of sleep pretty much left me hopeless, manic, crying etc. My psychiatrist prescribed 25 mg Seroquel for sleep and things are seemingly better. The current main side effect of Lamictal for me is spaciness, word finding difficulties, and vivid uncomfortable dreams. Seroquel has other side effects for me (ance for one). Improvements include being more functional, less raging, less crying, and less impulsivity. Good Luck!!! I wish you balance, happinesses, and no side effects."
BipolarReddit,fmpx1iw,t3_fwnlx7,1586288895.0,I pretty much can’t tolerate any alcohol or caffeine. Sometimes I’ll cheat with tea or decaf coffee (which seems to have just enough caffeine for my body to notice it).
JoshuaTree,fl5ed0m,t1_fl59o6h,1584834749.0,Awesome. My mistake 😬🤪 I was responding to the part where you said “two weeks from now” which I interpreted as meaning you would be visiting or traveling to the area.
JoshuaTree,fl546fk,t1_fl4z41f,1584828090.0,Stay home. Stay in your city. Don’t come to hike our trails in 2 weeks unless recommendations from the state of California change at that time. No advice. Perhaps there are trails in your city?
PMDD,fin7986,t1_filsaea,1582557422.0,PS Switching from agave to liquid monk fruit may be helpful.
PMDD,fima0xn,t1_filsaea,1582522642.0,Totally feel what yer saying and truly admire your dedication. 💯Glad you guys are seeing good results too 🙂 This shit goes back 3 generations in my family (including my great grandmother who killed herself by drinking lye). PMDD also went into the generation following me. We’re all chocolate lovers 😂
PMDD,filixad,t1_fik6v2s,1582502639.0,"*rant alert* Glad this worked for you guys! I wish I had the same experience. I am drug and alcohol free. No caffeine, no meat or fish, and off pharmaceuticals for now. I’ve tried no sugar, dairy, gluten, and carbs with little success, but I still limit these ingredients. I get acupuncture and take supplements such as magnesium, calcium, tulsi, and CBD (thc is more harmful than helpful). I do meditation and breath work daily. I do yoga and exercise when I’m not too fatigued. Guess what? I’m still on an emotional roller coastal with episodes and outbursts that affect all aspects of my life including my ability to make a living. Peri-menopause has made it worse, of course, and I don’t know what’s what anymore.  I may have to quit my 20+ year career and go on disability.  I beat myself up every time and blame my behavior and lifestyle thinking.... “Maybe it was the CBD,” “Maybe it was the chocolate,” “Maybe I’m not trying enough,” “Maybe I’m not doing it like Gwenyth (lol),”Maybe I’m a fucking asshole.” If I thought tearing my parts out would help, I would do it. Unfortunately, my research indicates that oophorectomy and hysterectomy are not guarantees of freedom either. At my best, I can see that my sisters (and other suffering bleeders) and I are fricking warriors.  I dream of a world in which all people are free of suffering. Meanwhile. I suppose we do the best with what we’ve been dealt."

PMDD,f5jp5lg,t3_dnx5gq,1572235242.0,"This has happened to me a lot! I’m on Yaz continuous, but still get hormonal days relatively frequently. It can be PMDD with a side of sick or Sick with a side of PMDD. Either way sucks."
PMDD,f5jovix,t3_dns4jk,1572234965.0,"I take the day off if I’m likely to be crying, irritable, behaving aggressively, and generally breaking down. It usually is a wasted day off, but better than doing cleanup on work relationships. If it’s just bad attention and memory day, I’ll go in and know I’m not going to be highly productive and choose tasks accordingly. If suicidal thoughts... it might help to be around people, unless a good binge tv show can move your brain away from the thoughts..."
PMDD,f5jo9m1,t3_dny33s,1572234375.0,"My heart goes out to you. It is hard to see loved ones suffer. She is so lucky to have you. It’s always a work in progress with My PMDD. I hope she finds the right cocktail of medication, diet, and routines.  Sending positive vibes."
PMDD,f0ztuck,t3_d7e7wm,1569102768.0,"This has happened to me too. My pharmacy carries (none generic) Yaz only for me apparently. I now call a week before I refill to make sure it’s in stock in advance. They might get annoyed at the regular phone call, but I tell them it’s for their own safety and well-being... “beware crazy hormonal lady”😂🤷‍♀️"
JoshuaTree,f0okjnv,t3_d5rl8f,1568813683.0,Good luck finding housing if you’re looking to rent. Airbnb yuppies have taken over housing.
JoshuaTree,ez8b73c,t3_d04ynt,1567738641.0,"Also, Subway and Castanedas are corporate chains in Joshua Tree. Not to mention the very corporate Airbnb’s, VRBOs etc. in JT neighborhoods taking housing from residence. It’s apparently not corporations that many locals are trying to keep out... its specifically DGs ugly buildings which seem to bother people.  Put a dead cow skull and some macrame on it, call it artisanal, and everyone will fall in love with DG😂😉"
PMDD,ex9y3jq,t3_crs0nt,1566096103.0,🤚🏽SLP can be an excellent choice for someone with PMDD as there can be a lot of flexibility and independence. Just pm’ed you!
PMDD,epshbpr,t3_bvif45,1559448957.0,"The only time I’ve ever thought of disclosing it was when I was in full PMDD breakdown. And it’s never a good idea to make decisions at that time! In most cases, there is little to be gained from disclosing. The best thing to do IMHO, if you have any control, is to seek a career or employment that can be flexible in hours and/or face time with coworkers."
PMDD,eoeffnk,t3_bra184,1558495138.0,"I had similar experience with birth control that stopped working for me. I had to get off it and try other things. Turns out at 42 I am peri-menopausal. So PMDD + peri menopause. I have found a new program that is working to some degree including for example new birth control, herbs, and acupuncture. It’s been like going back to square one! I hope you find what works for you and keeps you feeling balanced."
