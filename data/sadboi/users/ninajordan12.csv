Dogtraining,fqtomm9,t1_fqt8pow,1589643061.0,Thanks! Great advice.
Dogtraining,fqt68if,t1_fqsiana,1589631246.0,Thanks. It definitely may be part of that but honestly this is how he's always been. I just mean when I would be at my brother's he tends to follow you from room to room. He's always been a bit on the needy side but it's very sweet. My brother was almost always home with him too so there's that.
Dogtraining,fqsg83b,t1_fqsdcod,1589606421.0,Oh I'll check this site thanks!
Dogtraining,fqsg2zp,t1_fqqi3nm,1589606312.0,Yes we absolutely love him.
Dogtraining,fqsg13n,t1_fqqj8bn,1589606273.0,Yea we are doing the same. This is literally a new unexpected situation of maybe a month so we're trying to figure it out.
Dogtraining,fqsfvth,t1_fqr8qgk,1589606162.0,Thanks! Yes he is very needy/clingy. He's always been this way and he hasn't been alone much or even with other dogs. We're definitely stepping things up and trying different things asap now that we know we have this problem.
Dogtraining,fqsfnee,t1_fqrbhtv,1589605984.0,Thank you good tips! I need to save this!
Dogtraining,fqsfld5,t1_fqrbkt5,1589605941.0,Yes he acts quite middle aged actually lol. He's not the spunky teen everyone is picturing.
Dogtraining,fqsfj02,t1_fqrgnr5,1589605890.0,Yea if all else fails we might have to move!
Dogtraining,fqsfdps,t1_fqs0njg,1589605779.0,I wish. I actually just wish we could continue working from home. It's so much better anyway.
Dogtraining,fqseknr,t1_fqrczn8,1589605174.0,Thanks I'm going to look into it.
Dogtraining,fqseitd,t1_fqrm8iv,1589605136.0,Surprisingly he's a little less spunky than you'd expect. I think he might be mixed with pit bull terrier. He's lived quite a sheltered life without a lot of excessive exercise so he seems content chilling with his people. Definitely going to try getting him tired before leaving though.
Dogtraining,fqsebzq,t1_fqrndcz,1589604994.0,Luckily we've been with him everyday and haven't left him alone not once except for the test. We've probably over spoiled him. He seems very content and happy but definitely not good when we leave. Unfortunately I think he always had this problem and he hasn't been alone much.
Dogtraining,fqse2v8,t1_fqrqcrq,1589604807.0,Wonder if he would hate a crate if he's never had one. We could try it thanks!
Dogtraining,fqsdzig,t1_fqrri46,1589604740.0,Thank you. Yea it's not too good. My brother is only 33 and it was tragic/unexpected... shouldn't have happened / didn't have to happen. ðŸ˜“
Dogtraining,fqsdtfb,t1_fqrsgl0,1589604615.0,Thanks definitely going to try it.
Dogtraining,fqsdsms,t1_fqrtljs,1589604599.0,Yes I'm hoping this is a solution and he can pass an evaluation. He's quite unsocialized with other dogs.
Dogtraining,fqsdq35,t1_fqryzmx,1589604548.0,Thank you yes I'm looking into the day cares I'm just hoping he's ok with other dogs. He's been quite sheltered and non socialized.
Dogtraining,fqsdmys,t1_fqrz80q,1589604484.0,Aww I'm willing to try anything. He's the same as far as not really ever been left alone much and not around other dogs either. He's quite accustomed to lazy home life but he's quite needy and follows us at all times in every room. That's really how he's always been.
Dogtraining,fqsdh3k,t1_fqrz9ni,1589604367.0,My brother had him 7 years without a lot of space and unfortunately I don't think excessive exercise so he gets worn out quick. He's not as active as you'd think. I think he is use to the being at home life which is part of the problem. He's quite clingy and follows us at all times. He actually has not been alone a whole lot in his life nor really around other dogs.
Dogtraining,fqsd94b,t1_fqs9zws,1589604206.0,Thanks yes I just started researching the doggy daycare today. I just hope he passes evaluations. I really don't know if he could get aggressive with other dogs.
Dogtraining,fqsd689,t1_fqscagn,1589604149.0,Thank you. Yes he's a mix too but I'm not sure exactly what. Might be pit bull terrier.
Dogtraining,fqr3tfm,t1_fqqyobu,1589577069.0,Thanks. Does it get everywhere once unfrozen?
Dogtraining,fqppsj5,t1_fqpmq4o,1589551675.0,Thank you I will try these!
Dogtraining,fqpmq3w,t1_fqplzeo,1589549919.0,Thank you I will look into all these suggestions!
cincinnati,fqkcd4c,t3_gixfc7,1589424383.0,Guessing you looked up the property info on the Hamilton county auditor site. They usually have ownership cards that go way back in the images section.

cincinnati,fgba48a,t3_exnajv,1580659940.0,"ArtWorks has a list of all the murals and I believe some are on the streetcar route or you can urban hike it. The Hilton is a historic art deco hotel with the carew tower in the same building and orchards plaza bar. The banks has a small interactive park, sky wheel, and fountains. New Kroger might be cool to see. Vine by Washington park lots of restaurants a few small shops along streetcar route. Main street again lots of little coffee shops and stores along the streetcar route. Findlay market is down that way. New pho lang thang is somewhere down there. Main street steps go all the way up to Jackson Park Overlook if you like urban hiking. CAC contemporary art museum with 21c hotel nextdoor and it has a small art gallery as well.

Endo,f8x81uw,t3_du6etd,1574910822.0,"Hey all, just a follow up. I finally went through with the surgery. Three areas of endo excised (mostly on ligaments) plus a 2cm nodule of endo on my rectum. Also removed three fibroids from my uterus. I'm so glad I finally did this. Took me four years to get up nerve to go through with it."
internetparents,f8nvdi9,t3_e0uy96,1574653929.0,Get large plastic bags and bag everything. Run everything that can be run through the dryer. Bedsheets every night and wear fresh clothes everyday bagging the old ones and put them in the dryer too. The dryer is your best friend. Get the risers and mattress protectors. Keep running your stuff through the dryer. Spray the room and crevices with pesticide or the powder people are mentioning.

femalefashionadvice,f3s2nbt,t3_dhr3hr,1571095972.0,"We are a very casual workplace though I mostly wear not too tight dark skinny jeans.  I'm 5'7 and get the long size 10 from American eagle in the curvy line. I wear flats with them all non winter months. 

Turns out when I try to wear these with ankle boots or boots in general they get extremely frumpy looking, bunchy, and just not good. I bought a pair of flat Chelsea style boot (I think that's what it's called) and it looks horrible. Tried rolling up the jeans, again not good. 

On top of this I recently brought 3 more pairs of jeans same size and style thinking these were my type but turns out they're a little on the frumpy side but work ok with flats. I despise winter clothing! Help!"

Get a mattress cover to enclose them, spray around with isopropyl (need good ventilation), run your clothes through the dryer especially after sleeping and blankets pillow case.

hearing,ero6z2b,t1_ero5bsb,1561069912.0,I don't know. My mom had trouble with high pitch noises but never tested. She does unfortunately have dementia now age 63 and I don't know if it's related. I was an audio technician for 5 years and after that I noticed tinnitus. Honestly my hearing currently does not seem remotely bad to me. I really never struggled until recently and I thought it was because my new office uses white noise. I worked from home prior to this for four years. I don't know if I trust that test completely. I didn't really know what I was doing either.
hearing,ero6n3r,t1_ernzxvi,1561069638.0,Scary thing is mom had trouble hearing high pitch noises but never investigated. She's in a facility now because of dementia age 63.

I was out walking in the rain the other day... can I not get them wet? What about working out? Will they fall off? Would sweat or wet hair ruin them? How do the batteries work? Yea so I have a ton of questions and concerns.

Oh and can I use my headset at work?"

chicago,ep8ncus,t1_ep6qgjz,1559097234.0,"Just did this over memorial day weekend. Went from midway to downtown around noon then back around 10pm and managed to get off on the wrong stop. Everything was fine other than me feeling on edge because of how much you hear. If you've ever taken public transportation in a city like the bus etc the experience is similar. Midway was dead at 10pm. That was almost more eerie and perhaps waiting for the train at the platform. There were also quite a few unexpected issues during the day ride with the actual train (red line only) like we were rerouted though I would've not known had they not told us. The day rides were busy with standing room only once we transferred to the red line. Orange was chill though no issues.

I think I read green and red were the worst?

I heard sit up in the front car where the driver is if you're concerned."
