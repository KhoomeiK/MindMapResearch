But I can definity tell you that there's a ton of cocaine being cut to hell and sold nowadays. Most figures I've seen show that your typical cocaine bought off the street nowadays is more filler than cocaine. There's no surefire way to eyeball purity, but was the cocaine you tried a sort of fine or grainy powder? That's usually a clear tell that its pretty stepped on. You ideally want to see a nice flaky sheen on your chunks.
