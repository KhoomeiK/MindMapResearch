BABYMETAL,esdntcn,t1_esd2zti,1561863069.0,"I honestly don’t know what to say... I’m very sorry on the behalf of others for implying that he, or any person of Thai descent, is not “worthy” of collaborating with BM. 
I truly hate that a country so rich in culture is only really acknowledged and recognized for its food. Thailand has much more to offer than just some spicy foods.

I don’t understand why some folks were unhappy or confuzzled by a Thai rapper rapping in fucking Thai. (I.e his damn job) 
And I firmly believe that if BM were to feature on some “random” band with a lesser following’s song, like GVF for example, many in this subreddit would have a fit if those things said about F.HERO were said about BM. I can only imagine the uproar here if GVF fans would complain about BM singing in Japanese, their native language, as opposed to English. 

I do believe there’s most definitely some truth in what you said about the fans and how’d they probably wouldn’t have had all of this negative energy towards some English or Japanese speaking musician. However, I also believe that some fans in particular were looking for yet another thing to whine about.

I know this won’t matter to you but his rap never bothered me. I’ve always liked it. 🖤🖤🖤"
