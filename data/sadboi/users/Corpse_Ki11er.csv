(-)-Too lifeless and outdated.-Feels like a hotel  
\-Sidebar too crowded  
\-Pillows with text are tacky  
\-Painting is too small for the room  
(+)  
\+I'd replace the pillows and rug with some more colorful options, sticking to either a Dark Red, Yellow, or a Navy Blue to match the painting if you plan to keep it.  
\+A multicolored rug would add a bit more life on its own, staying away from too much shag.  
\+Plants. Add some plants  
\+Separate the decorations, particularly the redundant table lamp."

Depending on what all you're into, and how much you like to go out, there's a ton of stuff to do, and a lot of great places to go!  


\-If you like Coffee and Board Games, Lodestone (Minnetonka) is amazing and one of the best shops in the Twin Cities. Fantasy Flight is great too if you want to stay on the East Side of the Twin Cities.  


\-If you like Arcade Games, check out Up Down.  


\-If you like books, check out Moon Palace Books.
