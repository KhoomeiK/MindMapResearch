TheLastAirbender,fqzdkey,t1_fmgt63e,1589765126.0,"This is a good analysis. I've been trying to put together the plot points that lead to Azula""s breakdown at the end of ATLA because it did seem sudden and convenient. The best theory I have read so far is that he betrayal of Mai and Ty Lee caused a fracture in some of her otherwise inalienable beliefs and realities: that she can control people through fear (Mai says that she loves Zuko more than she fears Azula), and that she has calculated every single move (Mai tells her she calculated wrong). 

This, coupled with Azula's lack of guidance when Ozai leaves her in command, her suspicion of the Dai Li, who others have postulated only sided with Azula to wait out the comet before turning on her, and her issues of abandonment with her mother, somehow toppled her.

I would also postulate that it's possible that the intensity and ferocity of the energy that came with the comet just intensified all these things and caused her to have a psychotic break because it was too much energy to throw on such an unstable kindling."
TheLastAirbender,fqzay1p,t3_giax9v,1589763560.0,This is a great theory üëç
TheLastAirbender,fqz9w57,t3_gll1mp,1589762937.0,"I like the ending. The only problem is, Ozai and Azula are not going to show mercy if they have another chance. In a real world scenario, the sympathizers of Ozai would be encouraged to overthrow Zuko if they knew Ozai was still alive and by not killing him, you just keep letting evil thrive and have a chance to keep coming back. 

I do however remember several instances in the series where various characters like the owl spirit in the library saying that humans are constantly fighting each other and it's a never ending cycle of violence, so I thought the choice not to kill Ozai was in some way saying that this cycle must be broken, which is a very wise concept and it comes back again in Legend of Korra when Korra has to face Kuvira and the water tribe and the bloodbender who give it different viewpoints.

It's a difficult and complex problem that shows up in a lot of media because it's the ultimate decision for mankind, whether or not to rise above our most natural and primal instincts and defy nature by showing mercy instead of kill or be killed."

offmychest,fnpo0y8,t3_g37hio,1587148877.0,"As much as this story really makes me sad, it's also a miraculous event. Having an animal come into your life as a friend is always a miracle, and he came to find you to say goodbye. Cats are truly good friends and loving creatures and sometimes the thing about pets is that we can't control their destiny any more than we can that of a friend or relative. Animals are separate beings who live their own lives and sometimes come through our lives and cross paths with us for a while before they go on to whatever is next. A lot of people don't think of it this way because they view pets as a possession or something they can protect or control, but I don't think that's true. I'm sorry your ex let him out of he house because that's a shitty thing to do, but I am glad you got to have a really great friend for the time that he was with you. 

Most of my pets have been like that. Just friends that pass through, and I find them or they find me. I usually didn't even buy them or anything they just crawled into my lap or my life and wanted to stay so I let them. I didn't have places to stay sometimes in college so sometimes I had to leave my pets in the care of others and lost them or they remained there. But I always thought of it like respecting them as an equal and not a possession and wished them well on whatever journey they had next in store. That's of course easier to do with cats than dogs because dogs and other animals need more care, but you know what I mean. Hopefully Boon has an awesome cat life and there's no doubt he loves you. Psychic little critters."

If you take a mature tactic and explain that not having some space of your own is negatively impacting your mental health and well being and ask again, they may reconsider if it seems important. Don't wait until things boil over from you keeping it all inside. That's much more damaging in the long run probably.

My other idea is to cultivate a space outside your home for this purpose, like a favorite library, coffee shop, or park. Or take walks to have some time to yourself. An outdoor hobby would really lend to this, like bird watching, rock collecting, camping/survival skills, reading outside, etc."
