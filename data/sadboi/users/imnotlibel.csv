Everyone rips on this guy, mainly because he takes his job too seriously. He’s the IT security guy. It got fucking creepy. Anytime I would VPN in he would Skype me or text me instantly or he would make jokes about how late I was working. I was eating an avocado once and he asked me how lunch was going... fucking creepy. 

Meanwhile, I’m afraid to use my phone’s wi-fi while working from home cause I don’t know if he can stalk me through that channel too. I’m in Operations so I don’t know how IT magic works and if this is even possible- forgive.

I haven’t reported anything to HR because I do feel bad for him. I think it’s just an odd way of flexing for a new friend that’s a girl- I haven’t figure it out yet. The bullying he endures is far worse than any creepiness, I’m expecting him to quit soon so I’m riding this out."
