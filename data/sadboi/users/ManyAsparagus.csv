There was one in jeans & a rougher looking tshirt and it felt like the trustee kind of gave her the once over when she was called up. I amusingly got a letter in the mail before my hearing from a random company that was like go to our website! See what to wear!"

Bankruptcy,f4r6sj6,t3_cx6g1r,1571763572.0," I'm getting ready to file my paperwork on this coming Friday and I'm still not sure what to do about my car.  I'm hoping to switch careers soon after I file, to escape from an extremely toxic workplace, and if I end up taking a significant pay cut (maybe as much as 60%) my car payment would probably be unmanageable. It's currently 630 a month / 6.6% apr., with about $22k left on the loan.  I know I'm being emotional with my love for my car, but I also would need transportation to and from work. Any advice about reaffirming / surrendering? Is it even too late to ask my lawyer to include it with my filings?"
personalfinance,f38c37t,t1_f386je8,1570735298.0,"Yeah! I would tell myself - ok peanut butter & jelly for the next week, then would be sick of it by Wednesday & ready to eat out with coworkers even if I had food from home in the fridge.  I found I had more success being honest with myself about what I could really  commit to doing."
personalfinance,f384d8m,t3_dg2941,1570733298.0,"You should be careful with a personal loan- especially since you're still struggling with spending & budgeting.  If you take out a personal loan and then rack up more debt with now available credit on your cards you'll end up digging yourself into an ever deeper hole having to pay back twice as much M.  Look at your accounts.  Be realistic about what you spend every month. A budget someone else creates for you is sometimes hard to stick to because you don't have that personal investment. If you see that  you spent $whatever eating out at work 5x a week,  you'd be better off making a goal you can stick to ( eat out 2x instead) rather than what anyone else tells you is the correct answer.  if you try to go cold Turkey with cutting your spending you may end up giving up.  Know what you spend.  Reduce where you can.  It's ok to take baby steps if it means you're able to start to stick with it"

BipolarReddit,eset9f1,t3_c798ff,1561908928.0,"Questioning my diagnosis is like a 3rd wheel in my bipolar tricycle.  On the road into hypomania, I often consider that I must have ""tricked"" my psych into this diagnosis ( because obviously I am the smartest person the world and capable of manipulating anyone)  fortunately it is a pretty recognizable habit now, especially when looking back and seeing the patterns of my cycling."
BipolarReddit,esesqj3,t3_c79s7u,1561908541.0,"Im not a dr. So this is anecdotal...I did TMS and I loved it.  It helped crack through some really med resistant depression & didn't push me into mania. You continue with your current meds throughout treatment so if you're on an antipsychotic I think thata push into mania would be controlled by the right meds.  I haven't had any side effects, not even headaches,  which was the side effect they mentioned could be there.  

I wouldn't say it's the most comfortable thing in the world... despite it not touching you,  it feels a bit like a woodpecker knocking against your head, but not st as all painful.

My providers offered dTMS, which im pretty sure  is just a deeper penetration into your brain.  I haven't had any memory loss at all and to me it was a harmless,  let's throw everything we have at this depression type thing. 

They recommend good mental health hygiene for optimal results (water,  go outside, exercise) & I found add the TMS weeks went by I could do all those things much easier than before.  


 The only downside to TMS is cost... They had me going 5x week for 6 weeks,  and insurance charged my copays for all visits.  Despite that,  I am such a huge proponent of it being effective & well worth the $."

mentalillness,es1ylep,t1_es1xfcz,1561509230.0,Thanks.  It does seem like a lot when I list it all out rather than taking each thing individually. I guess I wasn't sure if im obligated to complain or explain or even mention that I don't want to see her to other members of the practice.  I'm not sure what the benefit of making something like this up would be - and it's easy to blame myself or think some how I'm over reacting and that at some point I encouraged her to feel more comfortable with me than I am with her.
