SuicideWatch,f3qw42a,t1_f3qhai5,1571081745.0,"it's because my family has always been quite low-income, so i just feel guilty for being a drain of their money. 

i get that they don't understand, but ugh, i just wish they'd try to. my mother often complains about her own self-esteem issues and expresses her own suicidal thoughts like ""what's the point in living?"", so i don't know why she's surprised & unempathetic that i also feel the same way. 

i've tried talking to a hotline through an online chat once before, and closed the tab as soon as they were available because i feel very anxious when opening up to people. somehow, i think i prefer face-to-face interactions about mental health because it feels more genuine, i guess, even if it's harder.

i do think that i'm overthinking that situation with my friends, but that's because they all seem to have a closer relationship to each other because i'm pretty quiet most of the time and struggle with starting conversations. i see myself as a boring person, so i think that's how they would see me too.

i really hate talking to my head of year unless i'm really forced to, it took me a week and a half to approach him in the first place about the counsellor. he's not bad, i'm just terrified of talking to teachers and he's quite intimidating. also when he was my subject teacher the last 2 years, i got in trouble a lot for not doing the homework and being late, so i feel like he hates me and i don't want to bother him, despite knowing that's his job.

my home life is pretty toxic, so i really didn't want to make it worse by giving my mother more things to shout and complain about. i know that my situation could be a lot worse, but my parents are both violent sometimes (generally that's better now than when i was younger) and my mother is manipulative and critical 24/7. it's fucked me up a bit.

also, my mother was with me during the gp appointments, and her input was really not helpful - small irrelevant assumptions like ""she thinks she's depressed because her brother has a bigger room than her"", paired with my gp responding to that with ""i had nothing when i came here from india, i made a life for myself"" type things, when *seriously*? having a small room is the least of my worries, it's cozy lmao.

i feel like a burden to my parents because i am financially dependent on them, so they're wasting their money on me. also because apparently i ""bring their mood down"" because i'm ""always miserable"", so they clearly care more about their own feelings while mine don't matter i guess.

i feel like a burden to my friends because most of them know about my mental illness so they have to deal with my negativity, while they've also got their own things going on. and i just feel very unwanted, like today one of them was sad and sat with a few of my closest friends, i asked if i could sit with them and she made this ""hmmmm"" sound that was clearly a ""no, i'd prefer you left."" obviously, i understood and didn't want to make it all about myself so i just left, but it just shows me that i am just easily disposable to them.

as i said, my friends know because i've told them. i've tried opening up to my parents multiple times, only to be dismissed. eventually they took me to the gp, where i was referred to a program similar to camhs, but i didn't end up going (because it had made my family relationship worse because they very strongly do not believe in mental illness). 

a few of my old teachers figured out that i wasn't okay, so they got my head of year to speak with me, and i asked him to put me on the waiting list for the school counsellor a few weeks ago.

people know, but it doesn't make a difference. i don't think anything will make a difference. i don't know if anyone even cares."

if you can't see a therapist or anything, try to at least open up to a friend/family member/even someone online if you trust them. talking to people makes it somewhat easier to cope."
