AmItheAsshole,fqmhhl5,t3_gjo8v8,1589477525.0,"NTA. Similarly, my mom talks about everything to everyone. I spent my entire adolescence overhearing her tell the same stories to multiple people on the phone. I secretively learned enough about puberty to know what to do when the time came, so I took care of it in the moment and just told her the next day that I'd started my period. I didn't want her telling the story of the actual moment over and over again to anyone who would listen.

I do think you may approach this a bit more productively though. Directly confront the story-telling when it happens, saying ""I do not appreciate your affinity for retelling this story. I felt violated when I accidentally saw that you had discussed specific developments in my body with your boyfriend. Your carelessness with my most intimate experiences during a formative time made me lose trust in you, so I actively hid my period from you for months. I personally feel disgusted that you find this story so entertaining, especially when every time you tell it, I've been sparing you from the truth that may feel like a slap in the face if you knew it. The fact that you tell this story as though it's funny, rather than maybe examining why I didn't actually trust you, is pathetic and I'm done letting you tell it for the sake of embarrassing me further. This is not a fond memory for me, and I'm letting you know that now so that you may choose your words more wisely in the future.""

TBF, maybe it's normal to talk about your kids' development the way she did. But what's not acceptable is that she knows this is an embarrassing story, therefore, there is some pain there, and she hasn't bothered to actually ask why you would hide your period for so long. She's telling this story because in her mind, it ends with *her* feeling betrayed simply because ""lulz, kids are weird"". If you explain what happened, how you felt, and why the story makes your blood boil even after you've found peace with the actual incident, perhaps you will find some closure and the two of you will grow closer. If you respond only with the retort you came up with, it may make her defensive and cause more of a rift that could otherwise be healed with a bit more conversation."
relationship_advice,fqee6gz,t3_gi9vko,1589306074.0,"I know someone who has endo and still birthed 6 healthy children. And I know people who seem healthy but have spent years unable to conceive or have had multiple miscarriages. What your daughter is really grieving is the loss of a picture perfect world. When we're younger, we think as long as we're good people, life will be great. But that's hardly the case. 

As usual on this sub, therapy is a great suggestion for this case. Your daughter needs to learn the skills to cope with major upsets in life, much like this one. And therapy is a great way to do that. Probably my biggest regret in life is that I didn't see a therapist sooner. 

I don't say any of this as though I'm looking down on her either. Reading it back, it sounds super simple and almost dismissive, but I've really been in the depths of similar issues myself. For me, I believed I'd never find love. I used to hold back tears at 26 years old as I walked around my office resenting all those happily married people, ""knowing"" I would never be like them. Lo and behold, I went through therapy, I worked on myself, and I just got married last week lol. But even if I hadn't, I'd be ok because I learned to be at peace with myself. Speaking from the other side of all that, I wish your daughter all the best and I have faith that she will find that inner peace. And one day, she may find that she's fostered so much love and happiness in her life that she'll hope she can encourage another young person just like herself."

CPTSD,fq27cgm,t3_ggfixi,1589053484.0,"I feel like this is an emotional reaction to terminology, rather than an attempt to actually understand what the terminology means. Like others have said, a victim mentality is a mindset that we are victims in unrelated events in our day-to-day lives. I think people can get into this pattern of thinking when they are overly spoiled (and therefore unprepared for real hardships) or when they've been victims of real trauma, especially over and over. I myself had to recognize my own victim mentality and learn not to cater to it. 

As for your tldr questions, I think the victim mentality is a real thing that many people can fall into. For example, just think of the ""incels"". Instead of taking the reigns in their lives, they complain about everything around them and how the world is set up for them to fail. However, the fact that this mentality exists is likely why many people are skeptical when victims claim they are indeed being victimized. So I get what you mean, but I think it's part of human nature to spiral into the victim mentality, and therefore it makes people suspicious when you claim you're being hurt. Kind of like if your kid said they failed a test, you might ask if they studied, how long they studied, etc, before accepting their claim that the teacher just hates them.

This is a great post. There are many people who either do feel the same way as you, or have felt that way. And there are people who are providing an outside perspective about why the concept isn't as bad as it may sound. I believe we should reflect on these things, discuss, and educate, instead of staging a coup against terminology that actually describes a real thing."

It's not that different from him having lost a ton of weight or having previously had terrible acne. He used to look one way, and now he doesn't. How he used to look may be unattractive to you, but isn't that the rub? It doesn't matter, because he no longer looks that way and will not look that way. He dealt with a huge insecurity in the way he wanted. He feels better for it. And now you think he's less attractive for having done so. Tbh I think this is a time for you to ask yourself why you feel the way you do, and allow yourself room to find that maybe your initial reaction isn't some reason to breakup, and that doing so would just be for the sake of not examining your own ego. 

I had to deal with these feelings in reverse when I got my nose done. Would any attraction to me be authentic? Would I just be fake? Would I be able to love someone who wouldn't have found me attractive before my rhinoplasty but found me attractive after? I had to make peace with the fact that altering my body to ease my insecurities was a form of being my authentic self. Just like my tattoos or any weight gain/loss. And I had to make peace with the idea that someone may love my new look and be turned off by my old look. But if their feelings toward me we're rooted in the fact that I changed at all, I would not want to date someone like that. He deserves someone who doesn't think less of him for how he's altered his looks, especially in a way that eased his mind so much. If it's not some unhealthy obsession with looks/plastic surgery, idk what reason there is to find this to be a deal breaker.

CPTSD,fp1xw6u,t3_gao8pz,1588250753.0,"I had this realization when I was finally going through therapy for depression! (Did not know about CPTSD at the time). There were times when I'd lash out a bit at my biggest helpers, and it sucked. But then one of those times, I got the image in my head of those dog rescue videos. (I friggen love those videos and sometimes binge them). Most of the time, the dog is so scared to be rescued that it'll growl, run away, or even attack the rescuer - even if it's skin and bones and the rescuer is offering food! It can take hours, if not days, to get hold of the dog. Sometimes the dog just isn't open to building trust in that moment, and has to be yanked out of the situation, fighting tooth and nail. Sometimes the dog is so matted or mangey or aggressive or beat up that you think ""surely they should put that poor thing out of its misery.""

But in the end, after a lot of time and effort, after showing the dog it's safe now and can rely on regular meals and a warm bed and loving humans, the dog really starts to open up. A once aggressive dog can be a cuddler. A once matted or mangey dog can be groomed and looks completely normal after some time. A limb or an eye or something may have to be removed due to injury, but that dog will be just as active as the other dogs in its household.

I realized I was one of those dogs. And I realized that at That point in my life, I'd finally run across some rescuers. So I learned to trust the people who were reaching out. And now yeah I might have some quirks I'm still working on, but for the most part I'm that happy pup in the end of those videos. :)"

Sounds to me like some deep-rooted cognitive dissonance. That's the teenage boy talking. He fucked up. HUGELY. And instead of owning that, or being taught to own it by his parents, he walked away from it. He hid from it and made excuses, like Simba in The Lion King. He thought his past was safely behind him, so he never went back to actually grow from it. 

So now Nala's found him. His past has caught up, and instead of fully examining his actions and bearing the burden of his sins, his ego is lashing out. He's making the same excuses he'd settled on as a teenager to help himself sleep at night.

CPTSD,fmwjnto,t3_fxliqh,1586447780.0,"One of the things about CBT is realizing that your thoughts are creating your emotions. 

Example: You cross a guy on the street who looks at you, scowls, and looks down. You feel anxious/depressed because of it. But wait. Back up. Did his action itself really make you feel that way? He looked at you and you thought (even if it's not in so many words) ""that guy must be judging me"". So you took his scowl and avoidance of eye contact personally. And that made you feel anxious and depressed. With CBT, you train yourself to recognize that there is a thought there, causing the feelings you're having, and then you retrain yourself with more *accurate* thoughts. 

So in this case, you may replace your original thought with ""That man doesn't know me and I am doing nothing that I know of to intentionally affront him. I sometimes make facial expressions while thinking, that have nothing to do with anything around me. Perhaps his body language has nothing to do with me in this moment."" You're supposed to keep backing your feelings into a corner, and for me, it opened my eyes to the fact that I'd been conditioned to attack myself so much that I was essentially choosing to be depressed. 

I personally found CBT to be quite valuable. It's ok if you don't. I hope you do find something that works for you. I'll say it took several months and my progression felt turbulent, like I was getting better but also felt so much worse in the bad moments. Whatever you do, it helps to be very open to being wrong. CBT made me feel like a toddler throwing a tantrum sometimes, but tbh that was kind of accurate. There were times I thought ""I can't be helped, life isn't that simple, this guy doesn't know what he's talking about, no one could possibly be happy if they were as useless and ugly as me"". But I allowed CBT to make me feel uncomfortable with that thought, and the bad times didn't last as long and weren't so bad anymore. 

A lot of people are saying CBT is like gaslighting, and I see where they're coming from. I felt the same way at first. But when I used CBT along with my therapist, the practice of it assured me that's not the case. She was very helpful in telling me when other people seemed to be behaving poorly, and helped me to see that there are some ways people treated me that were undeserved. I think then, that CBT is most helpful when accompanied by a proper therapist, who can make sure you're not just gaslighting yourself. The heart of CBT is that you can't control others, but you can control your own reactions. For instance, I do not have to internalize my narc mom's negativity. 

CBT worked for me even before I knew I had reason to be depressed (I didn't know CPTSD even existed). I worked on the depression and then learned its root cause lol. Fun times. Stay on the journey. However you fight, it's worth it."

I don't mean that cruelly, I just mean none of us is gonna get through life pristine and perfect. We all have marks left on us by something, and have to learn to accept or deal with those marks.) 

I don't like the idea of limiting our speech in this forum beyond the rules of Reddit. Perhaps the people invalidating others don't understand they're doing that. Personally, I dealt with a lot of manipulation and gaslighting growing up, and I've only just recognized little things I do that I never realized could've been seen as mean. Can we all just talk here with the aim of actual discussion, rather than looking to be validated and then being upset when we're not? 

What I mean is that we should feel that this is a place to have discussions about our perceptions and motivations. The last thing that I want, as a person with CPTSD from being raised by a covert narcissist, is to be part of an echo chamber. Even if it's the kind of echo chamber where everyone agrees with me and others are removed, it's not what I think we need here. Perhaps make a post with the understanding that you are asking for input from many people, and not all of them will agree with you and some of them may say things that you recognize as abusive. Either point it out or don't let it get to you personally. 

I'm saying all this based on the vagueness of your request for ""rules"" to be implemented. That sounds like certain people would be banned, and save for actual trolls, I'm hesitant to agree that people should be kicked to the curb so quickly."

I was raised by a narcissistically abusive mother. It's not uncommon in a family with a manipulative and abusive parent to have siblings turned against one another. Even if they themselves suffer at the hands of the parent, they can be manipulated to think their sibling deserves this particular dose of abuse. Cognitive dissonance is a means of survival in these environments, but also can create rifts between siblings that are all individually victimized.

Or she could be a golden child, truly never on the receiving end of the abuse because she's a girl and OP is a boy and therefore ""just like his father"" in their mother's eyes.

Agreeing with this. OP, I have CPTSD from childhood trauma so I understand how deeply those learned behaviors (like running away when you're overwhelmed) can take root. I know that even after years of therapy and self-actualization, some stressors can make us lapse into old coping mechanisms. 

I understand why you did what you did. And your MIL takes the fucking cake for first barging in right after and then doubling down and questioning your fitness as a mother. What you need to understand is that you are not just a trauma survivor. You are a mother. You had just given birth, and you were able to find the strength to do something that was honestly pretty self destructive. What you need to do is learn to channel that strength differently. Gather every bit of authority you can into your voice, and tell her to get out. Tell her you are tired (understatement) and do not want visitors, just the support of your husband here and now. Thank her for the concern and verbalize your boundaries. No, they had no right to cross the boundaries you had previously laid out. But sometimes that will still happen in life. Instead of allowing the lack of concern for your wishes send you back to that feeling when you were abused, turn the desperation into strength and stand up for yourself. And in turn, your child.

PMDD,firmdhy,t3_f9fz5z,1582667125.0,"Man this is rough. 

Real quick, here's where I'm coming from. Two years ago, I finally got therapy for depression. I learned CBT and worked hard to turn my life around. I've also listened to many self help books and lectures. I was mostly healed, but some ""old negative tendencies"" remained. 

In the past few months (since about October), I've discovered that I have PMDD, a narcissistic mother, and just recently learned that I have C-PTSD from my upbringing, which I also just realized consisted of narcissistic abuse and neglect. 

I've been dealing with PMDD head on, was I didn't want it to impact my relationship with my bf. Thankfully, he's wonderful and understanding. Every month, I calibrate my tactics. I've talked to him about my needs, I've set aside my pride (sounds way easier than it is) and been honest about even some of my most shamefully negative thoughts and feelings. So just know that what I say isn't a judgement on you, but just what I've done under similar circumstances...


> In these moments, what I really want is reassurance, but at times, it feels like he's outright refusing to reassure me. 

Right here, this can easily become manipulation. But the great thing is that it can just as easily become healthy coping. The very first thing you need to recognize and accept is that your husband cannot read your mind. You can talk to him outside of your hell weeks and tell him why his actions are possibly worsening your emotional outbursts. (""Even I feel this way and you say this, my mind interprets it this way which is why I feel worse""). You can also do the very hard work of recognizing when you're in the midst of PMDD, swallowing your pride, and verbalizing that you want to be rational but can't/need reassurance in that moment, need a hug and then some alone time, etc. And I mean it when I say that's very hard but absolutely possible and beneficial. It's like the skill of recognizing when you're in a dream, and then taking control of the dream. 

> Why is it so easy to forget what it feels like and what's causing it?

If you're not journaling, start. Journal the good days and the bad. There are great apps. I use Journey. Use tags so you can easily find things. Sometimes I look back on pmdd entries and even though I do remember how I felt, I feel so distant from the thought process in my good days. If you can look back on your PMDD thoughts and feelings when you're not in the midst of it, it can help to put things in perspective.

> Also, how do I cope with the lack of validation and what feels like a lack of caring and reassurance from him?

Being understanding or even validating does not have to mean he coddles and reassures you any time you get upset. Remember that wonderful and understanding bf I mentioned? Sometimes the best thing he can do for me is acknowledge me as a person (not a nuisance), but not give any attention to my moodiness. 
This especially hit home last month. I was upset and just felt worse because we were out with his brother and he had the audacity to have FUN with his bro while I was miserable about life stuff. But as he left me to sort myself out, still a member of the party, I realized that this was not only PMDD, but also the seeds of narcissistic manipulation. For me, that was a moment I realized how narcissism perpetuates. We all have moments when we want the world to stop and acknowledge our pain, but the reality is that we are not the center of everything. What did I choose to do? I chose to set aside my pain and focus on my bf's happiness. I was glad that his brother could bring him such happiness, and if I let myself be resentful of that, is that the kind of gf I want to be? 

I know this all sounds possibly way too sensible to enact during hell week, but it's possible. Have patience with yourself. Keep your husband in the loop. Learn to recognize when you're being toxic (it's ok, we all get a bit toxic sometimes). Start experimenting with coping and communication methods. And definitely have a conversation with your husband between cycles asking the same line of this post. Tell him you love him, you don't want to be abusive, you're exploring ways to deal with your self so that you don't hurt the relationship. And don't rely on him completely to regulate your behavior/emotions, but do allow yourself to lean on him where necessary.

Best of luck to you and everyone here. ❤️"

Be open with her. It takes great courage to admit your hardships to others, even after the fact. I hope she learns from it that everyone goes through hard times, and everyone ""fails"", as you may seem to be in keeping your promise to her. I'm not saying this is your obligation, but I believe it's the best path to showing her what it means to be strong, and sometimes that means being vulnerable.

Everyone has weaknesses and everyone is damaged in some way. I believe the root of depression (having clawed my way out of it myself) is knowing this on some level, and dreading/avoiding/agonizing over it. 

When I realized I had the symptoms of pmdd, I had a breakdown for about a day. I felt defeated, too broken to deserve my relationship, etc. But since then, I've made it my mission to understand myself more each cycle. I've been open about my struggles with my bf, even and especially when it feels impossibly hard. I've come to recognize more of my moods and their triggers, and I've gradually found ways to deal with myself in those moods. 

If anyone is demanding that you control your behavior and moods immediately, they're being harsh and unreasonable. But we should make the effort to help ourselves. Because we are the only ones who can truly improve our moods and behaviors. Don't be scared of needing time. Don't be scared of ""failing"" over and over. You DO have the strength to handle this.

She needs serious help. Maybe if I had gotten it sooner, I'd not have spent the last several years in a deepening depression. It took me over one year of serious effort to fight the negativity.
