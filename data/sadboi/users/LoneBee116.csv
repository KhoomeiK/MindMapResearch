Thankfully they don’t ask me rent but I help out with things around the house. However, recently I’ve been stressing out being sheltered in place with them. Ugh! I’m really considering moving out once I’m more financially stable because they kill the vibe. Nothing but nagging and micromanaging. That’s a no for me dawg."

You did productive things by writing down your goals and working on the easiest sections. It might help to break each section down even more and perhaps outline the next chapters. In addition to that, what helped me was to write my introduction last bc you’ll know everything about your thesis and you can sum it up nicely. But definitely take breaks and if you haven’t already tried... guided meditations are really helpful. There’s ones with different themes on Headspace or Calm so you can work towards letting go anxiety or stress. You got this! :D Good luck!"

AskWomen,fc6yjm8,t3_eg7srq,1577492812.0,"I had really bad cystic acne as a teen. Family members, friends, classmates and even little kids would ask me what was wrong with my face and they always looked like they felt bad for me. Family gatherings were especially hard because my skin was the first thing that relatives noticed and would talk about. This made me feel more ugly and I didn’t want to bring attention to myself so I became a wallflower.  But with some serious help from the dermatologist and the magic of Accutane, my acne went away in my late teens going into college. People started noticing me in a good way and I felt attractive. My family members no longer make unsolicited skin recommendations or give me pity which has been so helpful for my self-esteem but I know that I shouldn’t rely on my family’s comments to feel good about myself."

When I come home I transition from work to home by changing into more comfy clothes, eating a snack and watching a show that I enjoy. I also make sure that my work email is not on my phone when I’m home. And I know it’s not everyone’s cup of tea but I use the app Headspace to do guided meditations. Sometimes 3 min or 10 min of that is all I need to really re-focus my mindset and relax my body. If I go over 10 min of meditation I fall asleep hah"

Usually watching movies alone, playing video games, playing music or exercising alone refuels me after a long day of socializing. Some people don’t understand that even  playing video games helps.

AskWomen,f5vtb80,t1_f5vkrrg,1572499272.0,Sometimes Im embarrassed of living with my family too but then I think about all the bills I have to pay for.  Adding a mortgage or rent for an apartment would make things harder especially if I don’t have anyone to live with either. Right now it’s just my mom and I at home so it’s not bad at all. And I think it’s becoming more common for 21+ year olds to move back in with their family bc housing is expensive everywhere especially in CA where I’m at.

I help out around the house because my mom can’t do everything on her own. I also split groceries with her but don’t pay rent (thankfully). When I want to go out I usually just tell her where I’m going and then leave it at that. However, it’s frustrating when I still get lectures of being “safe” in the choices I make and blah blah blah but it’s just what my parents do as typical Filipino parents. I want to eventually move out when I save more money but it’s not something I want right now. It’s been nice spending most of my money on traveling."

If it’s really bad I’ll say a random word aloud or if I’m in public I would sometimes gasp for air quietly. It’s the weirdest reaction but it depends on the intensity of the thought that I had. Now that you mention it  I also probably do that to drown out the overthinking. From what I learned, grounding techniques like breathing exercises really help tone down my reactions related to the cognitive dissonance. Definitely takes time and practice to not react as much but it’ll help you become more present in the moment."

AskWomen,etuh1gq,t1_etu6e8l,1563212407.0,"I have felt this similarly. Sometimes I don’t feel good enough about my abilities/knowledge at work because I’m a young professional who just graduated. Because of my lack of experience I often doubt myself and don’t know how to just be content with where I’m at. A lot of my coworkers have worked there for many years which makes me the youngest one on the team. I know that I put a pressure on myself to be better everyday but it gets exhausting after a while. Like to the point where anxiety will keep me up at night ugh. I also feel anxious about whether or not I embarrass myself because of my lack of experience in the field. 
It makes sense that it sounds like imposter syndrome because it really is an internalized fear of being fraudulent. I just can’t figure out why I feel this way about my accomplishments. It would help to talk this out with a therapist but I haven’t found a new one that I like."
