Anxiety,f2e402d,t3_dd05pe,1570179369.0,"In all honesty when I'm having a good day and I manage to put my anxiety at bay, the last thing I want to do is sleep. I don't know what it is about me and my brain, but 2 in 3 mornings I will wake up anxious and I won't even know why.

Some days sleep really is that reset button. A gamble to where I might wake up either without anxiety or mind numbing."
Anxiety,f25z1o4,t1_f23mz8s,1569987734.0,"I appreciate your comment so much, man. I remember last month I was driving to a vape shop after work and the thought came to my head ""There's someone out there dealing with the same shit as me. Someone just like me."" I legit cried about it, I would never wish this amount of anxiety on anyone. I was still wiping the tears off my face as I walked in.

Turns out there is someone out there who's dealing with the same shit as me. I am glad you're feeling better.

Like you, my anxiety didn't kick in until a while later, my anxiety triggered a solid week after I dropped acid. I was on Quora reading about some folks experiences with bad trips just out of curiosity. One guy's trip was so crazy bad that every time he thinks about the concept of time he feels off. Reminding him of his bad trip. So I googled ""Is LSD flashbacks real?"" And this is where it got bad. The page loaded a series of other questions related to acid. 

""Does acid make holes in your brain?""

""Does acid change your personality?""

And finally, what really pushed me over the edge;

""Does acid cause schizophrenia?""

Hours of reading into symptoms of schizophrenia and HPPD scared me shitless. This is one thing I should not have done. All it took was anxiety and looking into schizophrenia symptoms to turn my life to shit.

I've really been considering telling my parents about how I've used acid and weed. I'd have no problem telling my mom about it, I actually really want to. It's not that I fear some form of punishment, It's that I'd feel that she would believe she failed as a parent. I actually told her last night when we were talking about my sister's possible depression. I told her that I believe I have an anxiety disorder. I told her I feel anxious all the time. I even told her I had a panic attack. She told me that I need to self medicate and not rely on a doctor, they'd only want to prescribe me pills for their pockets.

I am 18, though, and I will be going through with this with or without her. I believe after only a couple visits to a psychiatrist for reassurance  will be making me feel much better.

I really appreciate your comment, I plan to PM you soon. Still getting used to reddit so bear with me."
