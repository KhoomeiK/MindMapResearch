unpopularopinion,foln2tb,t3_g82jzv,1587865850.0,"I do agree that some brands are extremely tacky. I mostly prefer brands like Chanel, Celine, YSL, or Bogetta Veneta because they aren‚Äôt as flashy as Gucci, Versace, or LV. I have not purchased any clothing from any designer brands. I mostly shop for unknown designers who are just starting. What I do is search for the quality. If the quality is great then I know it‚Äôs long lasting and worth my money, but I do have a price at where I set myself to purchase something. For example, I found these really beautiful leather boots that was priced at $700 but was on sale for $250, and I snatched that baby up. Have had it for three years, and there is not even a single scratch, buff, or dent ANYWHERE on the boot. You want to be aware of purchasing something that is going to last you for a very long time to get on the return of what you purchased. Overall fast fashion makes you spend more money than when you save up for a quality brand. I have a nice collection of designer sunglasses that I wear, and I take very good care of them, and they don‚Äôt have scratches at all. They also don‚Äôt show the logo because the ones I purchase have the logo on a super tiny area of the sunglasses (I have no need to show off I bought expensive sunglasses I only bought them for the quality and for long-term reasons) (I‚Äôm lower middle class) I only have one Gucci bag and its a vintage that was purchased in 1994 by my mothers step-father, and she gave it to me. It‚Äôs not the typical Gucci bag that has a huge G logo on it. It‚Äôs a brown satchel that has the Gucci name in small print on the metal of the bag, and it looks very classy. 

It just depends on the person you‚Äôre seeing wear these brands. Some people just want to feel special because they have a designer brand, and purchase the most obvious bag that has the biggest logo of that brand so people can obviously see it. They just want people to see them as if they have money, but you don‚Äôt know the situation of that person finances. They could just be in a lot of debt to be putting up with these appearances. I never have debt on my purchases of brands because I save up before buying it."

Palestina was colonized by England, and England gave the Jews a land to call Israel which biblically was Judea, and our land since the start. Palestinians were just butthurt they lost the Arab-Israeli war with us. They decided to leave Palestina (hence me calling it Palestina because Palestinians did not have an official land since establishing itself since 1988; basically they were a tribe) and immigrate to Jordan. I think you‚Äôre also clearly forgetting that there were Mizrahi Jews in what is current day Israel. They have more of a right to that land than your opinion has to offer.
