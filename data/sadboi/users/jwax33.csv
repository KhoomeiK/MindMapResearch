That said, if your depression is serious enough that your family and friends not only notice it, but are concerned enough to try to get you help, I'd recommend going into your visit with the psychiatrist with an open mind towards medication.

Your visit will likely be some questions from the doctor to get a feel for what is going on with you mentally.  Answer as honestly and bluntly as you can.  This is the one person you don't need or want to sugarcoat how you feel to.

After the psychiatrist gets a feel for where you are mentally, they will probably make some recommendations.  Medication is likely to be one of them.  If you don't want to start medication, you can let them know that and ask about other options to try first.

Other options are primarily therapy based.  Both group and individual therapy can be helpful if your insurance covers them.  If not, they can be quite expensive.  In larger cities, some organizations like the DBSA may have free or low cost resources.

It is possible but unlikely that your psychiatrist will offer therapy.  Most psychiatrists focus on medication management for patients and refer them out for therapy.

Remember that there is nothing wrong with seeking help for your depression.  Depression is real and it can be very hard to overcome without help."
