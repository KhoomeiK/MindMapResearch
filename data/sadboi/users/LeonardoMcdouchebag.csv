insaneparents,fprepjb,t1_fpree2v,1588852089.0,"First off: the suicide rate is a result of the extremely high amount of bullying and abuse physically and emotionally that happens to trans people (in some cases even within the gay community). I don't think the child's identity that they decided on their own should be consulted by a psychologist or anything, if anything I think the parents should be talking with someone to figure out how to better suit the child's lifestyle choice. What's the worst that could happen? She feels better about herself and is accepted as a woman by her family and peers? And also, I don't think societal or cultural opinions are ever an excuse for not accepting a person for who they want to be accepted as (but I don't think that's what you were saying, I'm just being clear about all my opinions)."

insaneparents,fpre17n,t1_fprd0im,1588851523.0,"I'll genuinely engage with you and tell you: gender dysphoria as a mental disorder is really outdated. (Obviously this is an opinion) If your kid says ""I'm this"" as long as it's not harming anyone or promoting unhealthy behavior they should ask the kid who they'd like to be treated as and respect their decisions. If the parents are pushing the kid one way or another about their own body and identity, that's unhealthy, it's always a good idea to listen to kids, nobody does. As someone dating a trans person, I learned that when a parent denies it they're putting mental harm on someone. Her being trans isn't a disorder, but her parents treating her like that will give her the mindset that it is."
