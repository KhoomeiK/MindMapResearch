The best way to do that is make things seem as good as they are to represent your company better, that’s why they pay you. Any company will say whatever to sway things in their favor and lessen negative reactions. At the end of the day you guys have a product and you will defend that product no matter what. And it makes sense but I can see the silver lining because I’m the one who’s supposed to be convinced, not the other way around."

I have OCD and my therapist helped me calm down and let my thoughts pass and I live a peaceful life these days. It’s helped me realize we’re all going through shit no matter who we are and everyone’s human. A therapist can probably help you out (if they’re a good one). Find a good therapist is the best advice I can give.

xbox,fm3xcw8,t1_fm3wl9y,1585740383.0,I’ll look into it more but if I have to I’ll get someone I know to take the aux port out of the Power AA one and put it in my main one. Any troubleshooting techs you could give me?

xbox,fm3ux5y,t1_fm3uttn,1585737954.0,Only reason I don’t wanna do that is I spent 120 to get it colored and my name put on it and another 40ish to get the thumbsticks tightened so I’ll probably just get an aux port and have my uncle repair it.
xbox,fm3up92,t1_fm3unir,1585737722.0,How much would it cost to get the aux repaired? Where can I go to get it done?
xbox,fm3uki5,t1_fm3uijs,1585737578.0,That’s what I’m thinking. Around a year or two old.
xbox,fm3u9ni,t1_fm3u45s,1585737252.0,Yeah it’s a cheaper one. That could be the case I guess but either way I know it’s not completely broken since it’s working with one headset and I wouldn’t call that broken. I don’t notice any difference from now and when I used to use it. So what do you think is the problem at the moment?
xbox,fm3tkqz,t1_fm3tf8l,1585736496.0,Yeah but it’s confusing because I’m using a different headset right now and it’s perfectly fine. I’d spin the other headset aux around to see if it would mess up and it usually would but this one doesn’t so I’m confused as to what the actual problem is. Both controller and headset are fine on their own and I know because I’ve tested it.
xbox,fm3sznr,t1_fm3sx5o,1585735856.0,Yeah but why would it work fine with one controller and barely with another?

F13thegame,fgz5wn7,t1_fgz5jyz,1581191071.0,Did it glitch maybe? They added it? Who knows. Unless this is fake and you bamboozled us.
DeadByDaylightKillers,fgt4k26,t1_fgsoc8b,1581098904.0,100 percent agree. I’ve pretty much just bought new killers and that’s it. I see through their cosmetics scam. It’s rampant with video games these days. Another idea someone said would be to have all the streamers that play and have 1000 viewers or more to stop playing until all the major issues are fixed. That would work if it happened.
DeadByDaylightKillers,fgsgpgz,t1_fgsfy1a,1581083850.0,Completely agree. I’m on a 4 day break of DBD due to the stress and frustration that comes from playing killer. I play both sides but I don’t find being a survivor to be that interesting. I want killers to be fun to play since it’s the more interesting role to play. And I agree with those changes you said. I just hope they actually slow down the game because it’s been 4 years and to my knowledge they’ve never touched gen speeds so it seems like a far cry but I guess we’ll see in time. And the veteran players notion you added I agree with as well. Everyone that’s good at the game has at least 2000 hours. That’s a ridiculous learning curve and the devs definitely didn’t intend it since they’re all most likely rank 20’s. I would love for this game to be fun and balanced for both sides but I don’t know if the devs really care since all they want is DLC and cosmetic money from survivors and leave killers with sound bugs and other issues. It’s been that way since the beta. I don’t see them changing out of nowhere but here’s hoping they eventually slow the game down and make it fun for killers.
DeadByDaylightKillers,fgsd35u,t3_f09ssf,1581080913.0,There should be a boycott for this game at this point. Playing killer is too hard.
DeadByDaylightKillers,fgrs8jf,t3_ezpb9v,1581055748.0,Wouldn’t recommend it. You basically just lose everything and get a bloody cosmetic. It’s not worth it imo.
