AskReddit,fpwbbem,t3_gfsi0q,1588960451.0,"I visited the beaches of Normandy on a class trip to France when I was in middle school ( around 2007). At that time at least, you were still able to climb around in the trenches and down into the holes left over from bombs ( or at least it was easy to cross under a rope and no one stopped you). Being 13, us kids just ran a muck in the war site. 

I was running around and found an entrance space to an underground trench ( it was more of an underground tunnel--but I'm not positive.) I got to the entrance of the tunnel and looked to the right where the tunnel led and immediately saw this *thing* run at me. It kinda looked like a man but was not completely solid--like I remember it almost as just a force, but I somehow knew it was human. But it ran into me so hard, I fell  on my back out of the entrance of the tunnel and immediately scurried up and ran away as fast as I could. 

I never told anyone about it. I don't necessarily believe in ghosts, but I certainly don't think I'll ever fuck with a site of an historic battle ever ever again."
asheville,fpnrbva,t3_gda13t,1588770883.0,"I've posted once before about my plight...here we go again.

I have been unemployed since March 15th. I have done all the things required ( weekly certs, NC works account, contacted ALL my jobs past and present) and I have still been on a pending delaying payment for my status. 

At first the pending was labelled as Pending: reduced hours due to one of my jobs initially trying to keep me on for inventory purposes which fell through the first week I filed. It wasn't until last week when that employer did  his taxes that THAT pending stopped.

Immediately after that pending disappeared a fact finding survey popped up in the pending delaying payment section asking me about ""Pending: Personal reasons not due to work"" I answered the questions...said all my jobs were closed due to COVID etc. etc. UNTIL it prompted to say it was asking me questions about a job I had resigned from in Feb---that had nothing to due with covid. Not knowing what to do, I submitted the survey still saying all my jobs were closed due to COVID...and that became the new pending delaying payment.

I contacted that employers HR dept. after filling out the survey and they said they had received their first correspondence regarding me from the DES just earlier and had told them I resigned. 

Now its been 5 days and I am still on pending.

I have tried  to call multiple times...and on a couple occasions got in the hold queue to have my call drop hours in. I don't think calling will be an option. I've contacted Pisgah Legal, a financial advisor, NC works, a woman on the chamber of commerce....everyone I possibly can, and no one can help me.  The best hint I have possibly gotten is the financial advisor told me to upload word docs under the ""my documents"" tab of my DES account to quite literally ""poke"" someone from the DES to look at my account. The first time I did this, it corresponded with one of my employers doing his taxes so I don't know which action actually made the ""progress"". As of now, I basically send a document a day to try to lure them into working on my case.

I know if you are reading this you are probably in the same boat, but if anyone knows a remedy or literally anyone else I can contact please let me know. I have called every division of the DES as well and the closest I've gotten to info was a guy basically was like ""yeah, your status is open and you have money waiting for you when the pending goes away"" and when I asked how/if he could remove it he said no and transferred me to the line that no one can reach anyone on.  Its been over 2 months without income...I'm desperate."

asheville,fna12c3,t3_g0hbr1,1586788947.0," Its been 5 weeks of doing weekly certifications and I still haven't seen any money from unemployment. The entire time my account has had a ""pending unemployment/reduced hours"" on it which I presume is the holdup. I emailed the DES but so far no luck on the response. Anyone know how else to contact? As you all know, the phone lines disconnect...

The full story for clarification ( if it helps):

I lost both my 2 jobs in the middle of march. One of them, I worked only one day a week and for minimum wage during normal times, and the owner reached out to me and originally offered to let me come in that one day while the store was closed and do online sales. I worked the one shift and by the next week the ""Stay home stay safe"" law had been passed therefore shutting down my ability to go in again.

When I did my initial claim, I stated both my jobs had closed from corona, but I was still going in for that one inventory shift, which caused that pending status on my account. After that week though, I filed my next weekly cert saying I completely lost that job, and was now not working at all. I have filed stating I am not working since then and there has not been a lift on the original pending.

2 weeks ago,I contacted that employer, and he said he got a letter in the mail about my unemployment , but the letter had a wrong EIN for his business on it (he has a new store) and the letter stated that if the number was wrong he shouldn't use it on the website...but left him no other option to claim me as unemployed. He says he called around to other business owners but has still seemed confused and besides (from what I understand) claiming his shop is closed, has not remedied the situation about the unemployment because he doesn't know how to and there is no one to talk to from DES.

I did get a letter from DES asking for a copy of my SSN card 2 or 3 weeks ago, which I thought is weird and I sent it in. Now I see no trace of them requesting it ( originally the document they sent was under the ""my documents"" but since has disappeared.) THERE IS though under documents a form in which shows that my unemployment was confirmed and my totals for allowance etc. but I never received that letter.

I'm kinda at a loss. I've seen a lot of info floating around that I just need to ""wait my turn"" and I get that, but after 5 weeks on pending for something that is no longer happening ( that one 6 hour shift) I am starting to get really worried and low on money. I wrote a note on the contact form thats on the website, but I have heard many people have not heard back from it either. Does anyone know if there is another email to use or how else I can at least find out that I am truly ""waiting my turn"" rather than something crazy going on withholding my check? I am especially worried that because my employer can't figure out how to claim me as unemployed, I will never receive my check regardless of me not working and not receiving income."

Once, a couple in their 30s came in and were sat in the middle of the dining room. At some point of the night, the woman took her panties off, presumably as a sexy gesture to her date, but the guy wasn’t biting so she got up and stormed out of the dining room dropping her panties in the middle of the dining room floor. The panties were left until a manager tried to discreetly pick them up. The man kept eating like nothing was going on and told us to keep the courses coming. By dessert, he came to the host stand to ask us to call his hotel room because he couldn’t get the woman (who hadn’t returned) to answer her phone.  Turns out she paid for another hotel room and told the host to tell her partner that things were over between them."
