Switch,fqyvgsl,t3_glp1u4,1589755245.0,"I just know my wife's Lite feels a lot lighter than my original. File transfer should be easy from what I've heard, but a game like Animal Crossing New Horizons doesn't have a cloud save so its one island per Switch. Just make sure your games are cloud savable."
ac_newhorizons,fqyb36l,t3_gllt26,1589745720.0,Lots of people just suck. Play the way you like. Don't let others keep you from enjoying your gameplay. Have fun. 🖤😁😎

3DS,fqy476i,t3_gll35c,1589742311.0,"There's a Smash Bros for 3DS that you can play solo or with friends. There's also a couple of great Legend of Zelda games; Ocarina of Time, Majoras Mask, and  A Link Between Worlds. Animal Crossing New Leaf is still really super popular along with AC Happy Home Designer. Not to mention all the great Fire Emblem games and Monster Hunter. Do you like Pokémon? There's a lot to choose from. Yokai Watch is fun too."
malelivingspace,fqxpx0l,t3_glcxte,1589736066.0,That's awesome!

Unexpected,fqi8mxe,t3_giy01q,1589392403.0,That's some Vince Gilligan style editing 😎
ArtBuddy,fqauffe,t1_fqa8rbg,1589225467.0,I would add more detail. Make sure the shadows are darkest compared to the highlights. Maybe look at your color scheme and see where you can add contrast.

learnart,fpiyt4a,t3_gdqjni,1588652013.0,It kind of looks like they've got multiple vanishing points for their 1-point perspective view. I'd star with the bus and use a ruler if you can to line up the top line and bottom line to see where they converge. Most likely the middle-left just above the street.
