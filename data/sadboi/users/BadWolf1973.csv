I finally understand Republicans.  Well, most of them anyway.  They are children.  I mean, this coronavirus has effectively the same argument as the fanatical 2nd amendment folks.  It all boils down to the exact same question each of them asks.  What.  About.  Me?  That's it.  It really is that simple.  They don't care about the people in their town, church, or neighborhood.  Honestly, they don't even care about their own family members.  It's all about them and only them.  They got that way after at least 40 years (because I started hearing this in the 70s, probably earlier though) of being told that whatever their problem may be, someone else is the reason for it.  Well off?  Those damn poor people.  Poor?  You wouldn't be that way if it wasn't for affirmative action and all those people who don't belong here.  If you get told it's not you long enough, why should you ever think in that direction again?

Ever try to change a kid's routine?  It's hard to do and they'll throw a fit over it, especially if it involves an activity they love.  Take the 2nd amendment as a perfect example.  Now, logically, you can make the argument that guns need more restrictions and that guns (or really anything) that are military grade (or can be modded to military grade) probably shouldn't be in the hands of every Tom, Dick, and Harry in our country.  It should be at least as difficult to get a gun like that as it is to get the license and bonding necessary to drive a forklift.  

The reason for this is that assault rifles are weapons of mass destruction.  The Dayton shooting is the perfect example of this.  You had everything the NRA has said was needed to prevent mass shootings.  You had a good guy with a gun, in this case a police officer, and the gunman was downed 32 seconds after the first shot.  And in those 32 seconds, 9 died and 17 others were wounded.  People died because that guy was allowed to have a semi-automatic rifle.  10 others were hurt in the mayhem all of that caused.  That's 36 lives changed forever, plus all the PTSD it caused all those in attendance.  Funny how with all their arguments about personal freedom neglects to mention the loss of freedom they want others to forfeit just so they can be a special little flower.

Covid is no different.  It's either what about me or what about my money.  Because that's why Fox is pushing reopening the economy.  Billionaires are watching their fortunes sink and are getting more and more worried.  The President of the United States would rather kill a bunch of people rather than allow mail in voting because Republicans don't do as well with mail in ballots.  Kind of funny that for all their screaming about fraud, when fraud does happen it almost always involves a member of the GOP.  They tend to go quiet then.  They aren't asking, ""What about America?"".  They stopped doing that completely around the time of Newt Gingrich.  All they ask now is, ""What about me?"".

Democrats, for all their faults (and there are plenty), had the gut reaction to save lives.  But do go on telling me about how Trump was sent by God.  How great of a Christian he is.  And how the Bible is your ultimate divining rod as to what to do with your life.  Tell me the story of Jesus going to the leper camp.  You know.  Where he just shrugged at them and kept on walking because healing them might be bad for the economy.  You don't want to return those workers to the workforce.  They might take his job.  Speaking of Job, can you tell me how he killed himself instead of working through his problems?  I mean, it was obvious God wanted him to die there, why else do all of that to him?  Unless he was a Democrat and then I get it.  But do you?"
ptsd,fo704f4,t3_g5whfu,1587569893.0,"You say you've dealt with depression and anxiety for years... I just want to make sure that includes therapy.  If you haven't addressed what causes the anxiety and depression, you'll run into moments like this.  You convince yourself you're fine and you're past it, but then it blindsides you out of the blue.  It's not gone.  You can't ignore it until it gets better.  You have an actual injury.  It's not made up.  It's not your imagination.  It is the chemical cocktail that your brain sits in being goofed up.

Triggers aren't 1 to 1.  What I mean by this is (and I'm going to try to do this delicately so I don't trigger someone) if your PTSD comes from say physical violence, it's not just witnessing violence that will trigger you.  You could be watching a comedy and watch a scene where someone is hitting a ham as if they were spanking it as part of a joke.  That hand hitting that ham might produce a sound that will remind you of what happened.  I call them landmines.  You never know when one is going to sneak up on you.  One of mine is the scent of pipe tobacco being smoked.  Something I didn't have to worry about at all until recent years as that particular pastime fell out of favor.  They do now, however, make vapes that mimic the taste and smell of it.  Found that out the hard way while walking my dog one day.  So it could be a particular sound, words, symbols, smell, touch, or just a movie invoking the same emotions as you went through.

I find breaking PTSD into two different things helps.  You've got your emotional damage and you have actual physical damage.  While the emotional damage is obviously incredibly important to work your way through, it's also important to learn how to deal with the symptoms that are caused by the injury all that emotional damage caused.  It's a way to take away power from abusers.  They aren't directly causing the anxiety nor some of the depression.  That's your brain trying to deal with those chemicals.  They are symptoms of a very real health problem.  Talk with your GP more about that.  Even if medications have failed in the past, it's entirely possible new things have come onto the market.  Plus they can do genetic testing to see what medicines would work best with you.  And even if all of that isn't appealing, it's also entirely possible there are other things you can do to improve your mental health.  There's all kinds of diets out there tailored for specific things and your doctor is going to be up on which ones are real and which ones aren't.

Regardless, it's okay.  It happens.  Oh, it sucks... but it does happen.  It's not anything new.  It's just something old slipping back in to remind you that it's still there.  Listen to it.  Try to do what you can.  The PTSD wants you to do nothing.  It wants you to ignore everything because that's how you made it out alive.  You ignored all the terrible things around you during the event and for the time afterwards.  But your brain has no clue as to when it should start paying attention again.  Or even how.  Don't ignore your body giving you a warning.  Get help, hold that head up, and keep going.  Good luck!"

politics,fn6prbm,t3_fzwpi4,1586704860.0,"How many different ways can the media point out Trump is horrible for this country before they realize the people they are trying to convince with their article could give a flying fig about anything you have to say that destroys their image of America.  So let me be blunt about it.  Here's what Trumpers believe:

1. America can do no wrong in the world so long as a conservative is in charge.  They are quite adept at finding Bible passages to explain away their behavior (for example, please see slavery) and they feel that God has blessed this country so much more than other countries that if we did something, God willed it to happen.  It's why you'll see them saying ""God protects America"" right up until something bad happens inside America.  Then God is punishing us for (insert something they are upset about here).
2. America's founding fathers were prophets unto the Lord to finally make a land for white people.  You know.  Because there wasn't places for that until they came along.  Remember point 1?  You'll find them digging through founding father quotes in much the same way they search through the Bible looking for justification for what they are thinking about.  In fact, that's pretty much how the GOP does research.  They start with the answer they want and try to figure out how to reverse engineer that thought so it makes sense.
3. Feelings matter more than facts.  Hence every election when a Democrat is in power you'll see them bemoan the terrible state of the economy.  If the economy is doing well, they bemoan how much better it would be without a Democrat.  If they are in charge, it's all amazing.  No matter what.  We're fine.  Doing great!  Move along, nothing to see here.
4. Change is bad.  Want to be driven mad?  Have a conversation with a conservative where you talk about what is wrong with this country.  It might take some time, but you can honestly get them to see everything wrong that you see.  Well, except for racial issues.  You'll get to the point where you both finally see eye to eye and think you've gotten somewhere.  Aww.  Aren't you cute for thinking that.  That's when you run into the real brick wall when it comes to conservatives.  Solutions to problems.  From what I can tell, the GOP mindset can be summed up as: ""America is broken, corrupt, and no longer a leader in the world.  But why change anything when we're so great!"".  The very minute you bring up the word ""change"", you might as well stop talking because that conversation is over.
5. Neanderthal thinking on the political process.  Now I get Democrats are fully on the ""Anybody but the GOP"" mindset... but the GOP was there decades earlier.  Democrats are bad is a fact within conservative circles.  You could run Jimmy Carter for mayor in a town down South where he teaches Sunday School to most of the town's children and the conservatives in that town would still feel he's evil incarnate.  They'd elect a crooked conservative before they'd ever consider a good Democrat.

There's more, but you get the drift.  We're arguing at a brick wall at this point."
ptsd,fn6nvqp,t3_fzvd0q,1586703713.0,"When you get right down to it, there's not a lot of difference between pot and most every other pain killer on the planet in that your body will eat the medication until it can't get any further benefit from it and then what's left makes you a bit loopy.

Heck, one of the guys from the blue collar comedy tour, Bill Engvall I think, has an entire routine about being a middle aged dork basically getting his first try at pot.

ptsd,fir9lq4,t3_f9dyeb,1582660105.0,"The advice about getting a lawyer is spot on.  The government will actively encourage people not to do that.  It's a delaying tactic.  I once talked to a man who had a straight up hole in his heart and he was told, ""Nah, you're good to go"" by the government physician who examined them.  The shrink (because quack doesn't quite fit) I went to said I was a narcissist.  Because nothing says narcissism quite like a guy who felt like he was a fat slob who had failed everyone, won't look you in the eye, and was just a broken mess.  Amirite guys?

But, I tell that story to explain a point.  You will see a government physician who you just know is getting rated on how many and how effectively they fail people.  You will need documentation to fight that.  And they will absolutely ask for your medical records and want to have your doctor fill out some paperwork.  Therefore, a good place to start might be your doctor.  Be brutally honest.  I'm being serious.  Don't worry about what they might think of you.  Don't worry about how it sounds.  Explain to your doctor your routine and what happens throughout it and some of the why.  No need to give them details.  Just say ""trauma"".  Because that's what it is.  And if it's easier to type out, type it out and hand it to her.  Whatever you have to do so that your doctor knows what you're going through.  And then ask them if they think disability is something you should consider.  If you haven't ever been that honest with them, it's possible there's another alternative.  No clue what it could be, but you never know.  But, even if the doctor tells you they don't think disability is for you, still call the lawyer.  You may be getting bad advice and it's always good to have a second opinion.

Also, under the scenario I described, you're talking about a guy who just left your competitor with an unfinished cuckold story arc.  And.... your suggestion is they don't address that?

SquaredCircle,fiqw2i7,t3_f9axki,1582652695.0,"There's a lot going on here that we just don't know anything about.  For example, when Lana resigned, was it only because they thought Rusev would resign soon?  Or does WWE have some sort of plan for Lana independent of him?  Like trying to make her a top end manager.  Did Rusev promise to resign only to get Lana the payday and then walked away once the contract was done?  Is the reason for the cuck story to separate the two of them in the minds of WWE fans so that they are more free to use her in stories as well as the added benefit of no longer having to awkwardly talk about someone's spouse as they already have to do with Adam Cole (obligatory Bay Bay)?  Or is this just a CM Punk kind of thing where he's resigned and they are using the dirt sheets to further the story... which I gotta say would be an awesome angle.  Or a creative use of the medium at the very least.  This is just a weird situation.

But, let's do a quick thought experiment.  Just imagine if WWE buries Lana after they promised to push her separately so that the WWE are solidly the heel.  Now imagine, say 5 months from now, Rusev popping up in AEW.  Imagine the story that could be told there after all of that.  Because I bet Cody is.  Imagine Rusev cutting a promo about how every time that other company asked him to reach for the brass ring he did.  And each time they snatched it from him.  And then, when he had enough, they decided to humiliate him on TV to his family.  Imagine him staring into the camera with that stern, Bulgarian face and cutting a promo directly at Vince where he says he hopes Vince is watching.  He hopes Vince watches what he's about to do now that he's been freed.  Do some parallels with Mox, because you want people to think he was freed from where he was. 

That's a story with a Montreal Screwjob level of fan interest.  So one would hope they are smart enough not to hand Cody a ridiculously over story like that.  This story could drive a lot of interest if handled correctly, by either company.  Hopefully we get some sort of payoff for that mess of a story."
ptsd,fiqqi5e,t3_f98jw4,1582649829.0,"My therapist told me really early on that I should try to treat myself after sessions in whatever way best works for me.  For me, that meant getting baked.  It took me awhile to figure out why he told me to do that, though.  If you were an engine, PTSD would keep you solidly near the redline at all times.  Now add a therapy session on top of that where you are just trudging through some heavy stuff and you'll go so far into the red that the glass will break.  Adrenaline plus the cocktail of chemicals in your head that PTSD causes equals a bad mix.  What my therapist was trying to tell me was I needed an activity to relax into.  Whatever the PTSD equivalent is for you to that image of someone sitting in a chair with a blanket wrapped around them and relaxing into a good book or a warm mug of something.  The point is, you want to get some of those good time endorphins in your system to counter that bad mix.  It doesn't matter too much what that activity is, so long as it's something you enjoy.    
Afterwards?  Zone out to a game, movie, or whatever.  Your subconscious is going to work on things in the background.  Just let it.  

One other suggestion.  I noticed the art therapy is BPD oriented, so I thought I'd point out that there are a couple of BPD oriented therapy types that actually work on PTSD as well.  Specifically, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and Internal Family Systems.  DBT is CBT with Buddhism.  IFS is essentially the movie Inside Out where you personify emotions and try to dialogue with them.  I had a therapist teach me IFS and it helped quite a bit.  DBT... I kinda stumbled into on my own.  Buddhism has helped me quite a bit with perspective on life so you combine that with trying to fix your bad habits and you've pretty much got DBT.  I only know about it because my therapist commented to me that I sounded like someone who has been through it.  So I can recommend looking into those and seeing if a therapist who maybe is BPD specific would take you on as well.  Good luck!"
ptsd,finf5xa,t3_f8rbch,1582562284.0,"As per usual, I have no idea if this helps.  It's just my perspective.

PTSD keeps you on the edge of fight or flight.  You're just there, ready for whatever is going to happen to happen even when, and maybe especially when, nothing is going to happen.  It's also why it seems like it takes so little to set us off.  Of course it does.  We're already in the red.  I think that fact keeps us from thinking clearly and seeing the mistakes we're making until we're so far down the path it seems silly to stop.  

But there's a question you need to ask yourself.  It starts with, are you happy?  And we both know the answer to that is no.  But why aren't you happy?  Are you still doing the same things in life because it's just what you know or because they are making you happy?  That's more the question you need to be asking.  We don't really ever stop and think.  Our minds just don't shut down because if we let our brains go quiet, it tends to fill up with a lot of stuff we don't want there.  Usually unwanted memories.  So stopping to consider if you're on the right path honestly doesn't occur to us.  Or if it does, it's usually in passing and we feel as though we gave it the proper amount of thought.

Do you have to keep being in the armed forces?  Or, perhaps more specifically, do you have to keep doing the same job you're doing?  It sounds like you feel you should have done more, which I can understand on certain levels.  My PTSD is from abusive relationships and a grandfather best not discussed.  But I do have a sister and, though I shielded her from the vast majority of the awfulness in our lives, I have regrets too.  I regret I wasn't able to shield her more.  And, perhaps more perversely, I regret not being able to help my parents understand that they needed to get help for themselves.  Of all my regrets, that's the one that haunts me the most.  An awful lot of what ifs with that one. 

The place I landed that has seemed to help is shifting that regret into something else.  Honor.  Every day, I try to honor my parents because I made it out of the hole they never did.  I understand things they just have never understood.  And I can take the knowledge that I've acquired from all of that and use it to help others.  It's the only way I know how to honor who they were to me and what they might have become if only someone had given them the help I got.  If only they grew up in a time with educational TV so that they had someone else in their lives to tell them that they were good when their parents were telling them they weren't.  I regret what they might have been.  So I will honor that and become what I can with what time I have left.  And I'll use it to help so that others won't have to struggle as much as I did.

My advice?  Stop worrying about anything else other than you.  Go get the help you need.  And do something that I'm going to bet you haven't done in awhile.  Figure out what you want.  Not what your ex or any current SO wants.  Not what your family wants.  Or your country.  Just you.  What do you want to do with the time you have left?  How do you want to honor those who were not able to make it for all the various reasons in the world?  You've learned a lot.  And you will continue to learn a tremendous amount as you go through therapy.  What will you do with it?  

Just in case... be sure to look at your relationships before the war to see any similarities.  I just want to make sure it's only a war thing and not the abusive relationships being a canary in a coal mine for something else.  That the war made what was there worse instead of the war causing the PTSD.  Not saying it is, as this is just a slice of your life and a tiny one at that, but I just want to make sure you look at it.

Last thing.  The secret to defeating PTSD comes down to forgiveness.  You have to learn to forgive yourself for trying and failing.  PTSD will short circuit your ability to critically think after a failure.  We'll just beat ourselves up.  Yeah...stop that.  Failure is how you learn.  Figure out why you failed and learn from it.  Then?  Move on.  That's the skill you've lost in all of this and it's a hard one to reacquire.  But you have to.  If the dead could speak, they would tell you to live.  Live if for no other reason that they can live through you.  You can't stay here and joining them only continues the pain for others.  Forgive yourself.  Keep that chin up.  You've done nothing wrong and this isn't your fault.  Good luck."

ptsd,fiktazr,t3_f8a48a,1582486890.0,"I have three things for you.  The first is, you're valid.  The second is, your parents are part of the problem.  The third?  Nobody expects the Span..., I mean, sorry for the length.

On the first one, anyone who uses pain in a measurement of comparison is holding onto their pain as a personal cross to bear.  They don't want to get rid of it.  It's part of who they are.  People who have been through war get this a lot, especially if you throw in survivor guilt.  I think they get caught up in the pain having to mean something to them, it's special.  So they never get rid of it.  Just feel sorry for them and move on.  You shouldn't want your pain to be something you cling to.  You want to get rid of that crap.

On the second, remember, if you've been abused as a kid and that abuse was never addressed, it will screw up your world view.  Believe me, I know.  It took me 43 years to figure that crap out.  You're learning all the basic skills as a kid.  You're learning how the world is.  Except, what you got taught, is distorted reality.  Lots of lies and coverups on top of the trauma you've received.  When you are confused at how ""normal"" people function, that abuse growing up is why.  You don't understand normal or healthy because what you've got is patently unhealthy.  But, to you, it's normal.  You don't have the same shared experiences others have where their parents are just honest with them.  Think about the lessons kids learn that go into honesty.  I doubt you got the same.

Kids struggle with this.  We don't understand what's going on.  We lack the context to understand that our parents aren't healthy, are teaching you crap lessons that you know deep down is wrong...but don't know why, and just general knowledge of how healthy adults function.  That's a tremendous amount of context that you're lacking and are having to learn from other sources.  You're too close to see this.  When you live it everyday, it's just what is normal to you.

My advice?  Get the fuck out.  I know that task may seem daunting, but you need the distance from them to be able to see what is really wrong with your life and what you need to be working on.  If you're too young or whatnot, start planning on how to do that.  Focus only on that and tune everything else out.  It's scary.  It's terrifying.  It's hard.  But once you get away?  It's better.  That's not to say you won't still fall apart.  You have a lot of issues to sort through.  But getting away from people who are actively trying to prevent you from facing those issues will leave you stuck where you are at best and probably slowly falling backwards due to the depression of just being there.

Life is screwing up, figuring out you screwed up, attempting to fix the screw up as best you can, learning from the screw up, and moving on to the next screw up.  That's it.  The secret to life, however, seems to be the fact that the longer you pause between each step, the harsher the world becomes for you.  It's easy to look at our abusers as somehow free of this rule.  They don't ever bother learning, they just flow through life.  Except, that's not how life works.  Either that abuser is a psychopath, in which case they lost the genetic lottery bigtime, or that abuser is lying about life to everyone.  And that most definitely includes themselves.  There is no freedom to them anymore.  They just move from lie to lie in an attempt to fit in.  There's no enjoyment in that.  It's just, they were hurt and now they are going to do the same to others because that was what was done to them.  It's all they know now.  

I imagine that's what is up with your parents.  Their parents gave them benign neglect, so that's what you'll get too.  Long ago they probably figured out it was wrong, but there just were not the resources we have today to try to figure out what is wrong with you.  They just buried the pain and continued on as they were taught.  They are your warning sign.  Don't be them.  Don't act like them.  Don't look at life like them.  Start over and figure out who you are.  You know you aren't them.  I know it doesn't seem like much now, but that really is a good place to start.  Keep that chin up, you've done nothing wrong.  Keep fighting this and defeat it.  Do the brave thing your parents never had the chance or inclination to do.  Good luck."
relationship_advice,figr6pf,t3_f7txky,1582402655.0,"I think you may be overthinking this.  Ask yourself some simple questions.  Specifically, are you happy?  Why aren't you happy?  Is there a realistic path, given all the answers in the previous question, to get to happiness?  If you answer no to the last one?  You've got an answer that you can be at peace with.  You don't need a son to grow up in that environment.  

It's hard to get perspective on things where you are right now, but you do have a very large red flag I think you're missing that showed up in your story.  His mother?  Didn't just start acting that way.  I can guarantee you she's been lying all her life.  Nobody who just decides one day to pull a stunt like that has a healthy outlook on life.  No.  Body.  And that crap?  It's damaged your husband in ways that maybe you've missed.  To him?  Her antics will be ""normal"".  He's too close to it to see what she's doing to him.  Maybe I'm wrong and he'd move away with you, but it really feels like he's just going to stand by her.  Because that's what damaged sons do with the mothers who damage them.  I know I didn't see it for years, even after I moved away.  

When you can, take some time to yourself.  Walk to a park.  Go out in the backyard and stargaze.  Just something where you aren't dealing with work or that house.  Reexamine everything.  I'm betting once you start to do that, you'll know what you have to do.  Take care.  Keep that chin up.  And remember, even if you've done something wrong in the relationship, adults talk things out.  Adults work through their problems.  If your partner won't do that?  That's not your fault."

The Nevada caucuses come to mind as a really good example, actually.  Just about every news organization talked about a Bernie supporter throwing a chair and having video evidence of it.  They didn't show that evidence until the next day when fewer people were watching.  A guy, frustrated by the BS the Nevada chair was pulling, bent over, picked up a chair about 2 or 3 feet off the ground and slamming it down on the floor in what is clearly an attempt to vent his rage at an inanimate object.  The narrative magnified everything that was actually happening.  And that just kept happening.  Bernie didn't really go after Clinton.  He even told everyone to move on from the emails, which almost any political strategist would tell you is a dumb thing to do.  But nope, he was damaging her with his attacks before the election.  And if only Bernie hadn't attacked her so much she would have won.  It honestly feels like she blames Bernie for the loss more than the Russians and her ignoring the Midwest.

ptsd,fic7i3a,t1_fibwiop,1582339533.0,"I have some advice that is going to sound odd at first, but stay with me.  I had a moment of Zen back in December where I just was able to see clearly for the first time in my life.  The main thing that helped with that was the fact that my wife had been working on my back and something literally kathunked into place.  That was the actual noise it made, hand to God.  And in the after effects of whatever it was that got unlocked back there, my pain level dropped.  It was then that I could feel.  I could tell where my pain was actually coming from on my body.  What parts of it was caused by my bad luck in the genetic lottery, and how much of it I did to myself over the years through all my bad habits.  Not saying that you have a lot of bad habits, this is me.  I own up to them.  Especially because they all tie into what my parents did to me and how I was slowly turning into them.  I could just see the problem I had been wrestling with as a kid and then, for perhaps the first time in my life, I relaxed.  I'm still learning how to do that right.  I was just stuck in this perpetual state of guard.  Medical professionals had been trying to tell me that for years.  I never got it.  Crazy, right?

But I digress.  I think we numb ourselves so much that we can't feel.  I look back at the times in my life that I had jumps forward and they all coincide with drops in physical pain.  It's like you can think straight again, even when you're high.  I figure more out high than I do sober.  I don't know what options you have with state and job restrictions.  But taking a break from the physical pain can be of great benefit, if you can.  And yeah, I know how hard that can be.  If you can though, listening to music that slowly adds layers can help.  You'll wander down a lot of mental rabbit holes when you're high.  Some of them can get dark.  But, when you're high, you have a very limited memory.  So while the thought you are on is getting darker, it's also getting harder to hold the entire thought in your head.  The layered music helps that along.  As each new instrument comes in, your brain notes it.  That takes up space.  Eventually it'll knock you out of whatever thought you were on.  At least that's been our experience.  CBD won't knock the pain down as much, but if you get the real stuff and not whatever they are selling at Walmart or the convenience stores, it can help tap down the anxiety.  And the inflammation for that matter.  Salves with THC in it might not show up on bloodwork as they metabolize differently.  Obviously research that, but it's another thing to look at.  You don't get high off the salves.  It just goes into the muscles and soft tissue.  It helps a lot with neuropathy.  That's the stuff I know of.  I hope there's something that can help you with that.  At least it's something to ponder.

Also, not specifically advocating pot for the break.  It's just what I stumbled into and seems to work for me.  It does make me wonder about all those tests with Ketamine and PTSD.  Something else to consider, anyway."
ptsd,fibtpz6,t1_fiayq4t,1582329900.0,"This is going to sound dangerously close to ""mansplaining"", sorry about that.  Sometimes I just sort of start to write and stuff just pours out.  I don't mean to make any of this sound like I'm 100 percent sure I'm right about this.  I have a sliver of information of your life and I'm just reacting to that.  Plus, thanks to the type of abuse I had, I'm like that guy that has to fix things turned up to 11.  It won't hurt my feelings to be told too far or whatever.  I'm having to relearn how to go about a lot of things differently.  Social interactions being among the more clumsy of current issues.  Anyway, this is just a possible perspective on things.  It might give you something.

I never said we couldn't recognize pain in others and understand its causes in a blink of an eye.  It's way more about turning it inward and look at what you're doing and when you're doing it.  Everybody came to me with their problems and I tended to give great advice.  I never followed any of it myself, but I gave great advice.  Pain we understand, intimately.  We know what it does to people.  How it feels.  What it can do to you.  That might as well be a reflex action at this point.  

So, with that ankle, you'll ignore it until you can't.  And during that ignore period, you aren't necessarily nice to that ankle.  You're just trying to block it and power through the day.  By blocking it out completely, you ignore the warning signals that you're pushing it too far.  By the time you recognize the danger, it's far too late. 

That's more the flowchart I'm referring to.  You don't realize you're on it until you're about halfway down it.  So all those great skills at looking at others gets turned off with us.  If you are unsure if the world is going to hurt you that much again, you turn off certain aspects of that.  You numb yourself down.  But all you're doing is building a dam to hold everything back.  So it keeps you right there on the edge of fight or flight, especially in scenarios that remind you, in any way, of your trauma.  At that point, almost anything will burst the dam and all that pent up emotion pours out.  Adrenaline plus fucked up brain cocktail equals really bad things.  

If all of that is right or close to right, then your way forward is from the beginning.  The more you understand what the trauma caused, the more you'll be able to better understand when things begin to go off the rails.  You can start to work on correcting it.  It might be thinking or just how things are being approached.  At least, that's what the experience has been for me.  But, for the first time, I'm describing what I'm doing in a positive manner.  Trying to fix all my bad habits is like dropping ballast on a hot air balloon.  You have to get rid of enough of it before you can fly.

ptsd,fiah0tn,t3_f71fuf,1582300859.0,"I describe PTSD as the death of pattern recognition.  Quick version is it's like if you hurt your ankle and know it just needs time to heal.  You do your best to stop thinking about it.  But if the pain is relentless and overwhelming you can't just use the same technique.  An ankle is like unplugging a cord.  PTSD is unplugging the whole house.  You have to, your brain isn't built to withstand that much pain for that long.  It literally injures your brain via changing the chemical makeup of it.  So you stop paying attention to everything.  My guess is intimacy isn't the only problem.  Friendships will be rough because it's hard to track how well you are doing with your friend if you are tuning out most of what's going on around you.  You'll forget things easily.  And you probably don't take care of yourself as well as you should.  Like there are things you should be doing for a better health and you just won't do them and you have no idea why.  That all plays into that lack of pattern recognition.  You don't notice things until way later than others would.

You're injured.  The ""T"" in PTSD stands for traumatic.  As in stress so traumatic it leaves a wound.  It's not just the emotions you have to conquer.  You have to rehab that injury and learn how to adjust your life around it.  It's no different than if you had a traumatic leg injury.  That leg may never work the same again, but you can learn to adjust to have a fairly happy life.  It's about learning how to do things differently and stopping the bad habits you've gotten into as forms of self medication.  Just like if you had hurt your leg.  So, using the leg as the example, you're really fighting two fights.  There's dealing with why your leg got hurt and then there's rehabbing the hurt leg.  Just because you make progress in one doesn't mean the other got solved.

Not sure if this helped, just trying to explain why it might feel like you don't have it and why it felt like maybe you just got past it.  You didn't.  You just made yourself stop paying attention to all the symptoms it caused out of self preservation.  Therapy, talking to your doctor about symptoms, learning meditation, and Buddhist philosophy on pain all helped me.  Good luck and remember as you go through this that you did nothing wrong.  You're trying the best you can to deal with something medicine is still trying to wrestle with, and exactly none of this is your fault.  So keep that chin up."

Bloomberg, on the other hand, has spent 30 million on Facebook and Instagram ads alone.  He's spent about 130 million, in addition to that 30 million mind you, blitzing ads across all medias for Super Tuesday.

ptsd,fi4v5o6,t3_f6ejr7,1582149079.0,"The thing that helped me most was the realization that PTSD is an injury.  The chemicals in your head got changed due to prolonged stress.  If that's not a medical condition, I'm not sure what is.  Talking about the traumatic events, while necessary, will cause that injury to flare up.  Going back and talking about it is stressful.  My therapist recommended, very early on, that I come up with something to treat myself with after really bad sessions.  It's a way to acknowledge how rough that was while also encouraging you to relax into whatever it is you treat yourself with.  Me?  I went with copious amounts of pot and listening to my favorite music.  My wife enjoys expensive ice cream.  

The more you reassure yourself that there is a process in place to handle the stress of these sessions, the easier it will get.  Eventually I hit a place where I didn't need to treat myself afterwards.  I also got to a point where I realized adrenaline was my enemy.  It was just adding fuel to an already bad fire, at least in most cases for me.  So I've worked on meditation to help me if I get hit with a sudden burst of it.

But how much of that is starting a fire and how much of that just happens to cause more fire because literally anything in wrestling starts fires these days?  If you say, ""I like AEW"" then you can expect the WWE fans to shit on you.  And vice versa.  It really doesn't take much these days for one camp to get triggered and go on a rampage.

In defense of Meltzer, at least in this case, it absolutely is a dumb program if that's what they're doing.  Elias has been buried and brought back on an almost Ziggleresque level.  He gets over as a heel?  Turn him face.  People loving the face?  Turn him heel.  With no explanation of each switch.  I mean, what is he now?  Does anyone even know anymore?  He might as well be the Big Show when it comes to what he is on any certain day.  And they aren't exactly building him up right now.  No, him just randomly winning a match doesn't count.  Instead, what it looks like we're getting is a payoff from a storyline that died 2 years ago.  A story most fans have forgotten about and honestly weren't that sad when it was dropped.  That's what you're going to do.  For Cena.  At Wrestlemania.  

If you're going to do a throwaway appearance, like it's sounding like this will be, why not pay off the R-Truth/Cena stuff?  Have Truth mimic Cena at Wrestlemania (which also pays Truth back with a match there for all his great work this year), have the heels beat Truth down, and have Cena come down to make the save.  Great moment, kids go nuts, and the studio heads adore you for using Cena in the safest way possible.  That makes WAY more sense than Elias does.  It's easy to build to without any Cena appearances, it can be a short program at the show which will help with length, and it pays off a more current story.  Heck, make Elias a heel and give him and Cena a quick nod to 2 years ago within that.  That's all that's really needed."
ptsd,fi1ekur,t3_f5qpkg,1582056192.0,"I explain PTSD as being akin to not thinking about the slight pain in your ankle.  Except it takes that concept to 11.  What I mean by that is if you've got a minor pain that you know just needs time to heal, you'll do what your parents taught you to do.  You write it out of your thoughts as best as you can.  You stop paying attention to it.  PTSD is when the pain is so bad and so long lasting that you can't help but think about it.  So your brain, in response, stops paying attention to everything.  And I mean everything.  

I'm going to guess you have a bad habit that you know is wrong, but you just keep doing it over and over again.  You don't realize you're doing it until you are so far along with that habit that it will seem silly to stop.  And then you beat yourself up because you failed.  Again.  You do the bad habit because you need just a sliver of light in your life, even if it is only in that instant.  And you are ashamed that you need it.  All of which is the wrong way to look at it.

The reason you're doing that bad habit, that you know you shouldn't do, is because you aren't recognizing the moment you start to go down the path that causes you to do it in the first place.  An easy example of this would be pointing out what you do with physical pain, because to your brain... pain is pain.  Really doesn't matter where it comes from, it's going to react pretty much the same to it.  So you've got a hurt knee.  All day long it keeps getting worse and worse until you feel like your head is going to pop off of your body.  So you do whatever it is you do.  Eat, drugs, alcohol, hurting yourself, whatever.  Let's say it's eating.  You'll eat to the point that your body produces just enough of a chemical cocktail to lower the stress you are under.  You'll get a brief moment of clarity where you'll realize you shouldn't be doing this and in comes the bad thoughts about failure.  You're going to focus in on the food, and that's the wrong place to look.

Your vice kicked in because you failed to recognize the fact that continuing your day as if that knee wasn't hurt would only aggravate it more.  You did what you always do, you ignored the pain.  Sometimes pain is there as a warning, but your brain is just lumping it into the pain category and ignoring it.  You've got to stop that progression earlier, that way your vice never comes into play.  It's a reaction to what you're doing to yourself.  It's more of a compulsion than a true addiction, at least in the beginning.  Do it enough it will turn into an addiction, but that's just a further reaction to not taking care of yourself.  That is what PTSD will do to you.

Here's my advice:  Understand you have two problems bad problems and not one extremely bad problem.  You have the emotional damage and you have the actual damage.  The emotional damage caused the PTSD.  The PTSD causes anxiety, depression, and a host of other issues.  Emotional damage you work through with a therapist.  It can help lessen what the PTSD does... but it's not going to fix the symptoms completely.  Easiest way to think about it is this:  Emotional damage triggers adrenaline.  Adrenaline then hits your brain, which is already trying to deal with the new chemical cocktail that PTSD caused.  That adrenaline then mixes with the screwed up chemicals and... boom goes the dynamite.  Therapy helps limit the adrenaline surges.  Your doctor can help with the rest.  Might be a prescription, might be a diet change... depends on what you got going on.  But that stuff isn't supposed to be there and, until you learn exactly how to handle your new brain, you might need a crutch.  

Lastly, you're going to fail.  A lot.  But, that's what you're supposed to do at this point.  You have received a traumatic injury.  The T in PTSD stands for traumatic with the post part meaning afterwards.  You have a past injury.  It's real.  Fuck anyone who tells you otherwise.  Just like literally any traumatic injury, you're going to have to learn to deal with how your body works under the new rules.  Just like if you traumatically injured your leg.  You gotta learn how to walk with a leg that doesn't quite work the way it used to.  You'll fall.  But you get back up and keep trying.  You have to forgive yourself and move on from it as best as you can.  It's exhausting at first.  You will never know tired like you will each time you force yourself to try again.

relationship_advice,fi168kd,t3_f5si42,1582051448.0,"So, lemme tell you a couple of things.  One?  Your wife almost definitely has some sort of mental illness that she is trying to self medicate.  The behavior she is exhibiting is one who is in tremendous pain but is in extreme denial about it.  That tends to be the PTSD wheelhouse, but it can easily be other things.  The most important takeaway for you is to look at what she's doing in the now.  And that, regardless as to the cause, is her running from pain and not giving a damn about anything else.  You have thrown her lifeline after lifeline and she adamantly refuses to grab any of them.  You are becoming so desperate to save her that you may be too close to her when she decides, finally, to just drown... so to speak.  Some people won't grab the line, they just want to drown.  And they will absolutely take you with them if given the chance.  

Whoever you fell in love with is leaving you.  What you're going to be left with is a shell of their former self.  And that is what she wants you to be.  PTSD causes the loss of pattern recognition.  So, to her, she can't understand why you aren't doing the same things she is.  Yes, that is crazy.  Believe me, I know.  From both her point of view and yours, sadly.  You're too close to this.  I get that you can see how crazy all of this is... but yet there's just this urge to stay by her side.  To honor your vows.  Sickness and health, right?  Once you get some distance you'll be able to clearly see what all has happened.  And once you get to that point, everything else will fall into place.  You'll know exactly what to do and, though it will still hurt, there will also be some level of peace to it as well.  It helps to know that you are doing the right thing not only for yourself but for her as well.  The longer you're there fighting, the longer she's going to continue self destructive behavior.  She's honestly not going to hit a level of realization until you tell her you are just done with her.  And even then it may not happen.  The longer you keep doing the same thing, the longer she will as well.  Again, yeah.  I get it.  That's fucking nuts.  But it's also the stark truth.

My advice?  Walk.  The Fuck.  Away.  Try to let her have the dog (dogs can help with mental illness a lot).  Be prepared to give her most everything you own because that shit you can replace and the cost of that is well worth it when it means being done with her.  Get some distance as best as you can.  And get into therapy.  Yes, I know you've also made mistakes and there's probably a feeling that somehow this is partially your fault.  Yeah...no.  That's not how life works.  Adults?  When we screw up, we talk it out.  Life is screwing up, figuring out you screwed up, fixing the screw up as best as you can, learning from the screw up, and moving on with life until your next screw up.  And the longer you take between each step by delaying it as long as you can through lying, cheating and stealing, the harsher life will become for you.  That's what life is.  Your wife is eternally stuck on a loop between screwing up and realizing you screw up.  That's where she stops and goes back to the beginning.  And that is self destructive behavior.  That's not your fault.  You know you screwed up, you have attempted to fix the screwups as best as you could, and you've tried very hard to move on with your life.  She's constantly preventing that.  That is what's going on.  That's what you have to fix now.  Good luck, and keep that chin up."
battletech,fi0vuas,t3_f5qy6h,1582045813.0,"I think it depends on what kind of game you're running.  If the mechwarriors are after thoughts, then lore probably isn't needed.  But if you've got a story to tell and the mechwarriors are the drivers of that story, then the players are going to need all the context they can get to help them get to where you want them to go.  So if you've got a merc company who is only interested in contracts, you don't need the lore so much as you need to understand how business simulators work as that more closely resembles the game they want to play.  But if you're trying to solve the mystery of a murdered prince, context is everything."
ptsd,fi0v2iw,t3_f5iesv,1582045364.0,"Sorry for length.  I recently wrote that PTSD destroys your ability to see patterns.  So let's take food for an example.  You know you shouldn't eat the food, but you're hurting so much that you just won't notice you're doing the bad habit until you are actually doing it.  So, to you, it will just seem like you ended up in the same place you always do and fighting it didn't seem to do you any favors.  It's why people with PTSD repeatedly make the same mistake over and over again.  We don't notice when we start down the path of the habit, we only notice it at a point where it's just kind of stupid to stop.

We stop paying attention because paying attention was causing us harm.  I compare it to your ability to not think about a minor pain.  You just sort of write that pain out of your routine.   
But if you're in so much pain that just unplugging one or two things in your brain isn't cutting it, then you have to disconnect from the whole thing.  This is probably more true of people who get their PTSD from abusers.  It's just a constant state of abuse that you find yourself in when you're with an abuser, so all the clear signals everyone else seems to be picking up on, you don't.  I've come up with a way to kind of help with a little of that.  Look at everybody in your life, not just who you're with, and examine how they each react to a mistake.  Everybody screws up.  Everybody.  But how a person deals with a mistake can tell you a lot about them.  Do they try to talk it out and figure out how to prevent it from happening again?  Do they apologize and take responsibility.  Or do they deny it happened, downplay the results, or just lie so that it's not them who is the bad person of the story?  The later series of questions are the people you do not need in your life.  

Think about it this way, if PTSD is robbing your ability to see patterns and therefore connect the dots on what people around you are doing, then having people in your life who are intentionally distorting the pattern to take advantage of your inability to see things will be detrimental to your mental health.  You have enough of an issue figuring out if you've unintentionally hurt someone than to throw in the added difficulty of dealing with someone who constantly lies.

You're never going to get better being around people who only seek to sabotage you.  They take advantage of you not thinking clearly.  What I'm advising you to do is brutally hard.  You have to look at each person in your life and ask the question, ""Are you worth the pain you cause me to continue to be a part of my life?"".  And when I say each person?  I mean each person.  Friends, cousins, siblings, parents, significant other, doesn't matter.  It's a cold thing to have to do for self preservation, but sometimes you have people in your life who decided to not fight the pain as you have.  They decided to just succumb to it.  The more a person lies, the more that person has given up on just being themselves.  And you're just never going to find yourself when you're surrounded by people who are all desperately trying to avoid finding what you're looking for.  

My advice would be to dump your boyfriend, find another job in a different city or state, move the fuck away from everybody, and get the help you need with therapy when you're able to.  It's a terrifying thing to consider.  But you need that distance.  You need to be able to walk out of your home without the usual thought processes you currently have.  A lot of which is probably tied up with the people currently in your life and worrying about the interactions you'll have with them if you have a run in.  Distance helps with that.  Sure, you might have a family member or an ex track you down under the pretense of making sure you're okay or wanting you back, but those instances are easy to plot out ahead of time.  You just have to stay firm, ask them to leave, and if they don't you call the police.

You've done nothing wrong.  You aren't dumb for making the same mistakes.  You aren't imagining the pain.  This isn't something you just get over.  It takes hard work and time, but it's doable.  But you have to understand that what you're doing right now isn't working.  It's just not.  Change is scary.  The PTSD doesn't want you to change.  It will fight tooth and nail to keep you right where you are right now.  That's a natural response, though.  You're hurt.  If an animal is hurt, what does it do?  It gets scared, it withdraws, and its emotions will go all over the place.  What you're dealing with isn't that much different.  You just can't see that from where you are right now.  Change something.  Anything.  Even if it doesn't  work out, at least the routine got changed.  And sometimes, just changing the form of the misery can be a welcome relief.  You're going to fail.  It's okay.  You're supposed to fail.  You're rehabbing a traumatic injury.  Forgive yourself.  Keep trying and keep that chin up."

And some children just never grow up."
relationship_advice,fhxyyhn,t3_f59hvb,1581965169.0,"My ex wife had a problem with denial.  One day she turned to me, after she hit the brakes in the car late for the 100th time that month and I flinched/stomped my foot on the floor as if there was a brake there, and said that I was just like her father and her driver's ed instructor.  When I asked what she meant, she told me that they both thought she hit the brake too late.  Now me?  I can understand.  Maybe even her father.  But... a driver's ed instructor?  Just, wow.

Just to get you from ever going back to her, I'll tell you what will happen.  Your relationship will start to go through a cycle best described as the hands on a clock.  So from noon until say 3 pm?  It'll be amazing.  From 3 to 6 pm?  You'll get into a routine again.  From 6 to 9, you do something she views as a slight and she absolutely, positively, will not inform you of this fact.  From 9 to 12, things slowly build to a fight as she continues to do petty BS things.  And at 12, the fight happens.  She admits to her mistakes.  She may even go along with whatever you want to do for a bit.  But that denial will creep back in.  That she did nothing wrong.  That this is on you and she's perfectly happy.  No need to change.  And the process will just repeat over, and over, and over again.

You aren't the problem here.  She is.  Change your locks, find a good therapist, and take care of yourself.  You can't keep trying to fix her at your expense.  You will end up killing yourself trying to save someone who doesn't want to be saved.  Keep that chin up, you've done nothing wrong."

Try to remember it's a medical condition and not just something in your head that you've made up.  The chemicals in your head changed.

Maybe they're right and we've just about peaked.  But given the vast amounts of information we don't yet understand and have the room to learn from?  Putting any kind of ceiling on where we can go as a species seems incredibly pessimistic.  Especially given the numbers of those types of books throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.  The Aral Sea was drained thanks to one guy who called it an useless evaporator.  Even had the math to prove it.  You had another who thought they should drain the Mediterranean Sea.

ptsd,fhuhrtf,t3_f4r03j,1581886504.0,"I just want to say that it's okay to feel that way after being triggered.  Anything that causes your adrenaline to spike is going to aggravate the Hell out of your PTSD.  You're introducing literal adrenaline into a brain that is already trying to compensate from the fact that your brain's chemical makeup has been changed.  So, of course it's going to be a rough time of it.  You didn't fail.  You aren't weak.  You have a traumatic injury that is still very much in the healing phase.  It's no different from if you had a traumatic leg injury, stumbled, and fell down.  It's going to hurt like Hell, but chances are you didn't cause any further injury as it's pretty well cocooned inside you now.  Much like a cast around a broken leg would be.  And it's incredibly frustrating because you feel like you can see what should be done, but you just can't seem to bridge that distance between where you are now and where you want to be.  So you're going to be angry at this.  Especially at the unfairness of it all.

Try to remember this isn't your fault.  You didn't ask for this.  You'd gladly quit doing it if you could.  That the fact that other people don't understand what you're going through does not invalidate your pain.  That you are injured.  That you are trying.  Forgive yourself.  Rehabbing an injury nobody can see, nobody can find a universal cure for, and only you can treat is an incredibly difficult task.  It's okay.  You'll get there, so keep that chin up."
politics,fhuf8hh,t1_fhtcbjo,1581885730.0,"Wow.  Is a lack of hypocrisy that foreign a concept?  I mean, sure they all got buyer's remorse after the fact.  But given the climate at the time?  It was a put up or shut up moment.  The Dems tossed out a guy who was smart, funny, likeable, and with a proven track record against blowhards because to not do so would have been the height of hypocrisy.  

For example.  At some point the total weight of the hypocrisy of Christian leaders calling Trump a true Christian and a man of faith will collapse in upon itself in some sort of hypocritic singularity.  Because nothing says Christian like multiple marriages ending with multiple affairs to go with paying a porn star off to head off yet another failed marriage that would have been caused by adultery, to go with bullying little girls, to go with mocking anything that he doesn't agree with, to go with his constant state of rage, to all go with the fact that the man couldn't utter a single prayer, hymn, or passage from any of the religious texts even if you gave him a week to memorize it.  

Eventually, though I know it doesn't feel like it now, but eventually that will matter.  It already is to a degree.  Watch the under 30s flee the Church all across America.  That's the level of hypocrisy the Dems avoided.  It does matter somewhat that they tossed him out rather than push some BS narrative.  At least give them that much.  And I'm no fan of the Democrats.

One is dealing with the emotional damage the event(s) leading up to and including the actual trauma that happened, and the other is learning to deal with the injury that trauma caused.  Because PTSD isn't something you just get over.  Something stressed your brain so much that it changed the very chemical makeup of it.  That's not your imagination.  It's a medical condition.  As such, if you are having problems with anxiety, nightmares, depression, or any of the other lovely ""prizes"" we got as our parting gift from what happened, you should talk them over with your doctor.  Even if you are 100 percent against medications, there are diets out there that your doctor will know about that you just won't that could help.  Nobody can help you if they don't know to.

As for the rest... I can't speak to your specific situation.  All I can tell you is what I went through.  I had to leave my 12 year old sister when I left.

So long as she knows that she can reach out to you if she needs to and she can talk to you about anything.  So long as you know that if something bad happens you can contact the authorities (if you haven't already).  You'll both make it through this.  Because you two are the only ones who know what living in that house is like.  That will help you both later.  At some point you're going to look back at your childhood and realize that it was insane.  Literally insane.  So much so that you'll question that it even happened.  Back each other up.  Understand that none of this is your fault.  And cut them out of your life as quickly as you can.  Try to always have a place for your sister to run to.  And keep your chin up.

Not how far in space would we be.  Not if we'd be on other planets.  The question isn't even, ""If we combined all CURRENT technology, how far would we get?"".  If we went all in on tech and space, where would we be?  Considering we got stuff like pens, microwaves, and various alloys via that research, it's a fair question to ask.   

And even if it's the question you thought it was, I'd like to point out that there is a very real technology that would allow us to explore nearby systems via tiny satellites powered by lasers.  The only thing holding it back from being built is cost.  They even know where to build the damn thing.  Additionally, in a world where we created flip phones thanks to Star Trek, you really think we couldn't figure a way to put people in stasis with unlimited science grants and educational opportunities?  Or energy fields to battle back radiation?

Consider this thought experiment:  We figure out that our solar system will be hit by a high gamma ray event in roughly 1000 years.  You just think, ""Well, that's it.

ptsd,fhpukt6,t3_f4bi9q,1581795379.0,"I have no idea if this will help or not, but it's the perspective that helped me.  Pain acts as a river sometimes.  It just flows through whole generations of families carrying them with it.  It wasn't so long ago that the only people who held any sway over what formed your opinions in life was your father and your preacher.  That's it.  Their word was law.  And if they told you that something was how it was, then that's how it was.  To the point that if they told you that you were worthless, then they must be right.  There wasn't anything there to counter the argument effectively.  Sure other people might tell you something different.  Something more positive.  But it was always outweighed by your father and preacher.

Educational TV started to chip away at that.  I mean, Fred Rogers is as close as we get to an American Saint and if that man told you that you weren't worthless no matter what anyone else said?  That was something that carried weight.  Sesame Street is another counterbalance kids had, especially the latchkey kids.  There was a competing narrative in your head that said, ""Hey, what I'm being told by these adults is wrong"".

But you're still at an age where seeing your parents as the problem just isn't going to happen.  You depend on them for everything, especially teaching you how to interact with the world.  What happens, though, when how they tell you to act goes against the rules they've been telling you all your life?  Like, don't lie... unless we tell you what the lie is first?  That's a really complicated thought for kids to grasp.  It's hard for us to see through that when you're like, 12.  And if that's just been the way it's always been?  You aren't going to see it at 18 either.  It's something that has to be chipped away at.

It's a difficult thing to realize your parents are just wildly unhealthy people.  That they damage everything they touch.  Realizing that continuing to have any relationship with them will be detrimental to your own well being is just a brutal, BRUTAL process to go through.  It's hard to see that they were given choices similar to the ones you face now and failed horribly.  It's incredibly hard to have any empathy at all for them, really, even with that knowledge that someone else failed them.  And your parents never had the strength to face that pain.  They just keep running from it.  Lying, cheating, and stealing as they go because that's the only way they know to keep the pain behind them.

The only way you can really look at them in a healthy manner is through the emotion pity.  They are easy to pity, when you think about it.  They failed.  Neither of them are happy, but they are so afraid of facing the pain from their own history that they'll never address that.  Think about that.  You're there in misery because all you want in this world is to be happy.  And that misery is what they fled from.  You're stronger than they are.  A lot stronger.  It may not feel that way right now, but you are.  I look at the abuse, manipulation, and general apathy towards my wellbeing they had towards me and I feel nothing but regret for them.  I regret what they might have become if only they had the help I've had over the years.

Don't get that twisted though, just because I've gotten to a point of being at peace with what they did to me that I'll ever let them back into my life.  That.  Ain't.  Happening.  But I can regret their choices and pity what those choices did to them.  It makes them smaller.  Weaker.  Because that's what they are.  Small, weak things that are in so much pain that they no longer realize what they are doing.

My advice?  Move away from them.  Cut ties.  And any friend that says you're making a mistake?  Toss them out too.  Toss out everyone who isn't healthy for you.  You will lose a lot doing this.  Just so much.  It'll hurt.  It will make you feel like you have lost everything.  But you haven't.  All you're doing is tossing out the parts that aren't you.  You have to find out who you are, not what they made you.  You have to find what makes you happy.  To do that, you need distance so they aren't haunting you.  You need to talk with your doctor about whatever symptoms you have like anxiety or trouble sleeping.  And you need therapy to help sort out all these thoughts.  Consider reading Buddhist philosophy on pain.  You can take or leave the religious element, but their thoughts on pain come from centuries of examining it.  Think of it as Yoga.  You don't have to buy into the Yogi to get your back a good stretch.  Meditation is another thing worth looking at.  Centering yourself so you can feel what is really going on is an important skill to learn.  Pain blends together.  It will mask things from you.  Don't just ignore it.

Lastly, and I can't tell you to use caution enough with this, if you're in a state that has legalized it... pot can be a big help.  It can also cause a bad reaction.  Everyone is chemically different and how each strain interacts with you will differ.  And that paranoia can overwhelm you.  Getting a dog to go with that helps that out.  If the dog isn't reacting, there's nothing to worry about.  Plus dogs force you outside.  They're just a good investment for us and you can get emotional support animal designation fairly easily.  Pot plus getting a dog really, really helped me.  But I also totally get why it didn't help everyone.

That's what I've got.  This won't be easy.  Learning how to deal with what your parents did to you emotionally plus learning how to deal with the chemical changes in your brain from the PTSD they caused takes time.  You're injured.  You have a wound.  Fuck anyone who tells you otherwise.  You have to learn how to live with it now, just like any other traumatic injury.  Keep at it and know that none of this is your fault.  You did nothing wrong nor do you deserve any of this.  You deserve to be happy.  Go learn how to do that free of your parents' taint.  Good luck, and keep that chin up."

There was zero incidents leading up to this and, to be honest, nobody knew what the hell was going on.  Rumors hit hard and fast about some sort of race riot, but the admins weren't telling us anything.  It took, I want to say 3 days and a threatened walk out by students before everyone figured out what had happened.  There had been a fight at a sporting event that involved a white guy and a black guy, and it was apparently a pretty bad fight.  Nobody in the school knew about it for a couple of reasons.  One, it happened outside during the event so nobody witnessed it except teachers.  The other thing that might have been good for everyone to know?  Nobody involved in the fight went to our school system.  They were from like a couple of towns over.  And just to put the cherry on top of this ""race war"" nonsense?  The fight was started by the black kid because the white kid... had cheated on his sister.  Yep.  White boy cheated on his black girlfriend and her brother came looking for him.  It had nothing to do with race or our school system but they still treated us like we were on the verge of armed conflict for 3 freaking days.  And, again, nothing lead up to this.  Nada.

And I'm going to try to keep it vague and the trauma described rare.  But if anyone has been trapped in a boat, here's your warning now.

So we've got a ship's cook down in the galley of a fishing boat named Harrison Okene.  He takes what will end up being a fortuitous trip to the bathroom when the boat begins to sink in a sudden and rapid manner.  Several of his shipmates don't make it, but he finds air pockets to survive in.  He spends three days deep under water before a rescue diver finds him.  He survives this, but will never go on another boat again.  And, yeah.  True story.  Poor bastard.

Harrison was a victim of a catastrophic accident.  He survived it.  But he'll never truly be over it.  And that is all they are trying to say when they push the word survivor.  It's a transition phase.  If we put you in the story, you'd be on the rescue ship with a towel around your neck gripping a mug of some sort of hot liquid.  Because that's all anyone knows to do with you right now.  Nobody on that ship, even though they are trained rescuers, can relate to what you would have gone through down there.  And the more they look at you, the more you can see how much they fear it.  It just feeds into the mindset that you're still down there.  Trapped, and can't get out from under the water. Not on a boat beginning a road to recovery.  Accepting you're on the boat is all the word means. 

Honestly, the word that helped me the most was ""injured"".  I'm injured.  It's true.  What my abusers did to me left a very real injury upon my brain.  It literally changed the chemical makeup of my brain, which is why I have some problems that no amount of therapy or thinking will fix.  Anxiety being chief among them.  The anxiety is there because of the injury, so I should treat that symptom.  It, at least, gave me some way to approach a few of my problems in a more medical manner as opposed to emotional therapy.  It also separated the symptoms from my abusers.  Yeah, they caused the injury.  But the injury is causing its own problems.  I can make that two categories instead of one.  It felt like cutting the work in half.  And injuries can be rehabbed.

Not sure if any of this helped or if I'm just throwing fuel on the fire.  It's just my own experience with it."

worldnews,fh1punq,t1_fh1mxpw,1581220725.0,"Oh, I never said Democrats don't do it.  I'm simply stating the fact that Republicans weaponized it.  I'm not one who does the whataboutism as an excuse.  I'll use it to point out hypocrisy, but not an excuse.  Far too little acknowledgement of guilt in the world as is.  Between Gingrich and McConnell, there's been an awful lot of partisan nonsense.  Pelosi is what she is.  A creature of DC.  Yeah, I'd MUCH rather she not be there.  I'd have rather her have stepped down after the 2012 debacle.  She kneecapped the Democrats by hunting down all the moderates until she realized that, compared to the rest of her party, she became a moderate.  Roughly the same thing the GOP with RINOs, but smaller scale.  She wouldn't primary them.  She'd just strangle their money supply.  So don't think I'm blind to her nonsense.  But as far as pitting us vs them?  Oh, that's the GOP with death panels, racist accusations of birtherism, and everything else Fox News decided to debate instead of, you know, ACTUAL things that Obama was doing wrong.  Nah, let's do another expose on Benghazi.  Compare Benghazi to this.  After all that, even the GOP congressmen admitted they found nothing.  We've currently got the heads of both Senate and House Republican Judiciary members with trails that also lead to Ukraine.  But sure.  Benghazi is worse.

I'm not the one who is blind.  Even if you believe all media is fake, just consider these facts:
1.  At Helsinki Trump said he believes Putin when he says Russia had nothing to do with the interference.  Did that on live TV.  He has never corrected this statement.
2.  RT News, a Russian state owned media outlet where failed liberal talk show hosts go to die, begins pushing the Ukraine theory.
3.  Trump begins to parrot the Ukraine theory.
4.  Congress, the NSA, the CIA, a bipartisan Senate subcommittee, and all our NATO allies continue to say Russia is behind it.  All of which you can find on CSPAN so, again, not news media related.  Trump continues to say they are wrong.

You're really comfortable with that?  Really?  Forget Biden.  Forget everything else.  That above?  You can't dispute.  And if your conclusion on those facts are: Well, his ego won't allow him to admit that he got help?  You should want him out of the White House even more.  That's not a temperment you want in there.  Oh, and that Helsinki thing?  We still don't know what Putin told Trump.  Only Putin, Trump, and the two interpreters know.  And Trump IMMEDIATELY put privilege on that interpreter.  But sure.  It's all benign how he's putting privilege on literally everything.  You might want to pay attention to more than the us vs them stuff.  This is different."
ptsd,fh1odh2,t3_f11z5b,1581219580.0,"I had a great uncle who was in the Army Corp of Engineers shortly before WW2.  When the war broke out, he was in Southeast Asia helping to build bridges.  He and his men were behind enemy lines for about 2 years before they were able to get out.  The man, after the war, became a pig farmer.  Whenever we went over to his house my father would sit me down and say, ""There will be plenty to eat.  But only put on your plate what you can eat.  Do not leave food on your plate, your uncle doesn't like that"".  We'd go over and his house would have about 6 freezer chests just full of food.  Just, full.  He surrounded himself with food as a security blanket.

I think food insecurity, as something we talk about as a society, got short circuited during the great depression.  You had an entire generation grow up with that.  So ""quirky"" things like food hoarding was normalized to some degree because just so many people did it once it was safe to do so.  There's a cottage industry on Youtube right now where they show depression era cooking.  It's more of a recipe book now as opposed to, you know, trying times an entire generation went through."

worldnews,fh15an6,t1_fh11r52,1581210955.0,"Um, no.  Go back and watch Helsinki again.  Was Russia responsible?  He believed Putin that they were not.  So, if not Russia, who?  Ukraine.  It's not rocket science.  And the only thing Trump can point out that Ukraine actually did was the op ed.  And the op ed in question was, ""Hey there.  Did you know Crimea belongs to us and you aren't helping us at all when you say Russia can just keep it?  Here's some reasons why"".  THAT was the Ukrainian interference.  The supposed hatred of his campaign.  How would you feel if a Mexican candidate started running for his Presidency on the stance that Texas should be returned.  Should we just be silent about that, or maybe remind them of some basic facts?  No fake news.  Well, some.  But that's RT News.  Putin's propaganda station.  That theory was all over that platform.  You know, that Ukraine was behind it all.  Which, again, every single intelligence department said is false.  No fake news.  CSPAN.  Congressional hearings.  That's a question that will come up. 

Trump is a con man.  You can offer no proof of his intelligence, his health, his wealth, proof of Obama's real birth, no proof that he's moved the needle in a positive direction.  Most of that because he refuses to show any of it.  But you keep believing that's because of the left hating him and not covering for how inadequate he is.  He is essentially the walking, talking modern version of the emperor with no clothes on.  Keep basking in his glory.  History will remember.  I'm comfortable with that.  Are you?  really?

But somebody else is just going to come along and promise those same people something different.  And off they go again.  It takes more than military might to end the threat of ISIS.  Trump absolutely doesn't get that.  If he did, he wouldn't have abandoned the Kurds.  All he ended up doing was continue doing exactly what Obama had already started.  Exactly.

That's largely thanks to the wonders of how I was raised.  So, just understand that all this is me just rolling stuff around in my head.  

Maybe profession is too broad a query.  How I'm set up is Anger (who has sort of transitioned into a more of a ""big me"" as opposed to ""little me"" role) handles a lot of early warning.  We know each other's voice.  We know if it's in his voice (avoiding his and little me's name as they are direct derivatives of my actual name) that maybe I've got some anger creeping and to look for that.  So more of the offstage director.  Little me wears a lot of hats currently as we are slowly learning how to pay attention and how to relax.  Yeah, I'm honestly having to learn how to untense muscles that I have been guarding with for decades and just relax in a chair.  So it's a lot of going back to the beginning.  His day to day job, however, is to bring light into my life and to help others as he can.  And especially if it costs us nothing or next to nothing to do so.  Those two are average, run of the mill archetypes.  One old, one young.

And here's where the first detour happens.  Next is Jackson.  It took awhile for me to figure out their pronoun.  Their original job was just to chain Anger up no matter what.  They didn't talk much at first.  More, emotions.  But they slowly came around and now they are the ones responsible for the clear slate.  They were the ones who would cause me to trust my gut when I had no reason to.  They were always the one pushing us forward the right way when the world told me to go the other.  Only made sense to give them the job.

Last is Bear.  And yeah, literal.  Bear is what I am down deep.  Just a big, lumbering, easy to hug Bear.  And he's the keeper of my secrets.  The stuff that I repressed, he held onto.  Every time.  Every single time I've asked myself a hard question and just suddenly knew what the answer was, it was Bear sort of saying, ""It's about damn time you asked that, here you go"".  Freaking bear.  But I know if I hear anything in his voice that it's of vital importance.  If there's one voice in my head I trust the most, it's his.

It's also a bit important to take into account everyone's health.  Yes they can hide stuff from you, which is why you enlist everyone to narc on the other if they feel it's important.  Bear, though a pretty chill kind of animal, is horribly wounded.  He looks terrible.  But then, that's what an animal would look like after years of neglect.  It's also his self image though, one that I'm slowly breaking.  But how each of them feel can give you clues as to what is really going on.  If one is exhausted, look at what role they've been doing.  Is it the task that's wearing them out, or is it something else?  

So that's more the professions they need to be looking at right now.  It takes a lot to run a brain.  There's a lot of emotions, logic puzzles, observation skills, language skills, memory, subconscious thoughts, etc.  Finding the right member for each of those will get you further than if you even got everyone to agree on one profession.  

Side note, apropos of nothing but I plan to eventually write an urban fantasy novel that meshes the werewolf trope of having a wolf inside your brain with you and combine it with IFS.  Use the genre as a vehicle to explore, so to speak.

The only concrete suggestion I have for any individuals would be for Silvy.  It might be a good idea to find some music that has lots of layers that slowly get added.  Something like ""Debutante"" by 65 days of static.  Get really, really high.  And just let the pain catch up a little.  Sort of skimming along the surface.  The reason the music is important is I've found that the more layers that a song introduces, the harder it is to not be pulled back to the song even if I fell in a bit when high.  It's using what pot does as a crutch for exploring dark thoughts.  Pot, especially when you're stoned, limits what you can store in your memory bank.  The more you drill down, the more that memory bank fills.  But, those layers begin to add up in that total too.  Eventually you just jar out of it because the music got too distracting.  For me, it's when the ""ah""s hit.  If you listen to the song, you'll get what I mean.  And then, you stop.  Just enjoy being high.  Unless you hit something important, in which case I'd journal it out.  Not only will that slow your thoughts, but it gives you a breadcrumb to follow when you're more sober.  It's a way to slowly bleed that pain down.  It'll take awhile, but it's doable.

No idea if any of this resonated, it's just been my experience with it."
