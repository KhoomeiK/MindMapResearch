FemaleDatingStrategy,fq6n8d9,t3_ggiju4,1589134788.0,most things on this sub are extremely sexist. i feel bad for men trying to date in a world like this.
hybristophilia,fodofr5,t1_fodnwdw,1587687194.0,"that‚Äôs a great point, he‚Äôs probably adapted to that environment and it would be best for him and the most respectful to victim‚Äôs families. he seems to be doing well there and his sister visits often, so that‚Äôs pretty good. sadly, this is probably gonna be the best it‚Äôll be for him."
hybristophilia,fodmlu9,t1_fodluhz,1587686560.0,"i was having a conversation with my dad about the life sentence and he pointed out how when child killers are released they‚Äôre too old to do anything and it‚Äôs pointless releasing them. i think i heard that kip kinkel completed a degree since he‚Äôs been in the institution so i don‚Äôt know if that applies to him. if he were released, what do you think would happen? it would be hard for him to get a job probably."
hybristophilia,fodlcmy,t1_fodl4yi,1587686122.0,i feel really bad for him but i think he‚Äôs doing well now.

hybristophilia,fodhglu,t1_fgdbvkl,1587684741.0,"i definitely feel like the fact that they did something bad contributes to the attraction. for example, i know i really shouldn‚Äôt have a crush on dylan klebold but that makes me like him even more and all his good qualities i like seem more intensified to me."
hybristophilia,fodgyuu,t3_ez0hre,1587684563.0,"i‚Äôve considered writing to kip kinkel before, just something friendly or maybe draw something for him."

unpopularopinion,fodf84w,t3_g6hhjc,1587683941.0,it‚Äôs so disappointing how many young women don‚Äôt have much of a dream now. sex work or pornography like onlyfans or camming has been so popularized that they feel like they can just sell their bodies without working for anything. it‚Äôs kind of dehumanizing to women.
unpopularopinion,fodd1mr,t3_g6nx44,1587683155.0,Exactly! A lot of my online friends (who are in the same time zone as me) tease me for falling asleep so early which is usually 10-11pm.

PsychWardChronicles,fmmlqdr,t3_dkrbxo,1586207588.0,"when everyone was in their room during visitation, this 13 year old told me he liked me and was trying to give me advice on my bullying. he somehow ended up asking if i had ‚Äúsexual thoughts‚Äù. i didn‚Äôt like being alone with him anymore."
PsychWardChronicles,fmmlakx,t3_dkve66,1586207354.0,"my unit had a wii and xbox fortunately. i‚Äôve barely ever played video games, but there was an annoying kid there who always played the xbox. sometimes we‚Äôd do multiplayer in dirt 3 and i‚Äôd crash his favorite car because it pissed him off."
