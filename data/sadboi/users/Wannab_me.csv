mentalhealth,fr3aotq,t3_gm9rxy,1589853369.0, I'm so happy for you. I'm confident this is the beginning of your new life 🤗

therapy,fqfrzbt,t3_gikdt4,1589330539.0,"Sometimes you just like the advantages of some behaviour like eating whatever you want, postponing, spending as you want...these activities make people feel pleasure and it's difficult to give up on it when you're not aware of the advantages of letting that go in the long term"
CBT,fp75vln,t3_gbjq65,1588364620.0,Sounds good! How much is it?
therapy,fp6qjzy,t3_gbj4u7,1588356866.0,"Wow, I get you so much!!!! I studied systems engineering because I didn't pass to the college I wanted. When I realized it wasn't what I wanted I gave hints to my family (to my mom and my older sister mostly) and they were mad. They couldn't believe I wanted to toss these 3 years I had already been studying, so I just kept studying and finished my bachelor... medicated and feeling scared to be a bad professional.

I thought this would end when I'd get my degree...well, it didn't. I have a decent job in my field, which makes it harder to change my career. I think I love psychology and sociology but can't figure out a path there. Anyway, I have started accepting that staying with that career was the trigger to anxiety (I'd lie to myself and to others saying that I didn't know the reason but every time I'd thought of changing my career I'd get an instant relief).

I want to study a master abroad too. I told that to my therapist and she was very clear not to study one I didn't like. So stop forcing yourself to go to classes you're not interested in. You're smart and I'm sure you could succeed at any field, but what about your happiness?? If you're feeling worse my advice would be: quit. Quitting requires you to be brave and maybe disappointing your family, but they'll get over it. You'll keep feeling anxious because of what, ego? Money?

If it gives you some motivation, I can't quit my job because I need my money to help my parents and my sisters, but I just enrolled to a free sociology course online. I'm trying to know if I really like it, if I do, at least I'll have the satisfaction of learning what I really love. I think deep down you may know what you like you just decided to put it aside to please others and pursue the career that fate gave you. 

I'm guessing you're smart and everyone around you has big expectations about your future, it's scary to disappoint them. But if they really love you, they'll understand that even if you're not super successful, what matters the most is that you're happy and validating your wants.

I feel you. I think we have a very similar story. It'll be better, just listen to your body, it's trying to tell you something. Future doesn't have to be amazing, you're still very worthy no matter how successful or exceptional you are. Good is fine too. You're enough.

Big hug :) and I hope this helps a bit

Ps: I highly recommend you to read David Burns books!"
mentalhealth,flpgngm,t3_fo5brq,1585359037.0,"I believe only a professional is going to be able to tell you from a psychological perspective what's happening to your mind.
While that happens, you can exercise, avoid bad fats, sugar, coffee and maybe reading a self help book can help (I extremely recommend David Burns ones).
Anyway, you seem to be mindful, caring person. Don't let your results in life determine your worth, you are very worthy whatever you do or don't do in life. Maybe you're being to harsh on yourself and could start by recognising the good things in you, I'm sure there are more than a few.

Big virtual hug!!"
Anxiety,fgljrlb,t1_fgbjhfr,1580901246.0,"I'm sorry you have experienced that. I'm sure that no matter what you're worthy and deserve to be loved. 

Hugs for you too :)"
Anxiety,fgljnc0,t1_fgb205c,1580901095.0,Sorry about that. Hope you find the reason. For me it's related to self-esteem and inferiority feelings...

mentalhealth,femmlyc,t1_fel1maf,1579262735.0,It triggered mine and I actually posted it on the anxiety subreddit getting mixed replies. I guess it really depends on each person.
mentalhealth,felnoas,t3_epm1uy,1579226524.0,"I feel you so bad! My mom did the same to me when I'd argue about anything (and everything) with my annoying bully sister. I felt like I was the only one getting that message and I started not just being resentful about my sister but letting other toxic situations happen in my life just to avoid conflict or ""not starting"" it.

When I went to therapy my psychologist opened my eyes... when she told me every emotion tells us something about what's happening around us or how we should react and that anger works as a protection signal...I was surprised! Before that I felt guilty and not deserving of having the right to be mad!

Now, when I'm feeling angry I evaluate the situation and ask myself if I feel I'm being offended about something. My response depends on the kind of aggression (and also timing, if it's not the best moment to talk about something it's better to just wait)... for example if a waiter was rude I can have an angry expression in my face and communicate I didn't like whatever made me mad. But for example if I'm having an argument with my sister and she yells at me, now I know I can yell too (I tried that option) but I prefer communicating my discomfort and why I'm feeling it. 

Becoming a conflict avoider just made me weak and an easy target for bullies and stupid people who feel better by mistreating others...so, keep in mind that you can be mean too, you can defend yourself too and you have the right to do it if you're being harmed (for me violence just create violence) but I've come to understand that we have these social rules that actually put you on some level of the hierarchy, and no one should be left on the deep bottom. (Power cues is a book about how corporal language affects relations) so...hope this long text helps you even a bit.

A hug from a person who was also told once to not fight/argue/talk like that and became anxious thanks to that"
Anxiety,fdly212,t1_fdjo7qc,1578535227.0,"You're very welcome! 😊 I really hope it works for you. From the distance there's a stranger who sends you the best of the energies! 

(I just saw you have the word ""Venezuelan"" on your nickname, if you speak Spanish the book is called ""Adiós, ansiedad"" 🤗)"
Anxiety,fdj7jby,t3_ell7tg,1578460665.0,"First of all, I'm sending you a big hug, I know this feeling of craving for help but not having the resources to get it.

On the other hand, after having the opportunity to get it, the most powerful tool that I have gotten in there is a book: Feeling Good by David Burns. It's not a random self-help book, instead it is a way to know those thoughts that are giving you a hard time. And the writer (a doctor) gives you several ways to change them. 

It takes time and discipline to feel the difference but it's worth it. Other advices I've gotten are: taking sunlight, spending time surrounded by nature, practicing some yoga or meditation and not drinking coffee.

I hope you get to feel better, you deserve it!"
Anxiety,fdj62wd,t3_elljw9,1578459472.0,Congratulations!! I'm happy for you 🤗
Anxiety,f3py46u,t1_f3pqz2j,1571066752.0,"There are people with similar symptoms for sure. That's not into discussion.

I think you're just assuming by saying who is going to watch the movie and how they would feel about it. As I replied to you previously, there are different opinions (even articles) written about this polemic. We just differ. And we would need a study to make statements like who's watching it and how they're perceiving it.

People are free to do whatever they want, I sincerely hope a lot of them become compassionate about these kind of symptoms but I also hope they don't link metal illnesses to violence."
Anxiety,f3psgxp,t1_f3pra9k,1571064309.0,"Yes, maybe not a diagnosis but a little bit of real information about mental illnesses would be appreciated..."
Anxiety,f3ps4q8,t1_f3ppl5d,1571064156.0,"Yes! Of course it means that, I'm not expecting everyone to think like me, that's exactly why I asked if anyone else had the same feeling and some people said yes, other people said no. The end :)

I certainly won't judge if thinking somehow is either good or bad but I definitely think different opinions make the world better.
Have a nice day!"
TheNational,f3phnog,t3_dhedcp,1571059312.0,This is so cool!

Anxiety,f3pgyve,t1_f3p1ncm,1571058972.0,"I disagree again. Please don't make statements like ""the mayority of others"" if you don't have any serious study about it.

Anyways, it seems like we're both  overgeneralizing. Not everyone is blaming mental illnesses for the violence and not everyone is thinking it's not related at all in the movie, just in this post we can see people that support both points of view. 
So it's obviously a perception thing of a very polemic movie.

Cheers!"
Anxiety,f3p1csx,t1_f3p0vng,1571037950.0,"I disagree. I think they're linking it directly to his whatever mental illness he has (there's another article trying to diagnose him but they can't find anything). Anyway, yes of course there are triggering situations being shown... But the message in the background is that if he reacts violently to these situations is because of his mental illness..."

AskFeminists,f3ex4ll,t3_dgq028,1570886688.0,"My mom has experienced severe trauma. She's been seeing doctors for almost 30 years now. (Public system health in Colombia for the first 20 of these years) non a single doctor sent her to see a psychologist. 

More or less 10 years ago I understood she needed help for her mental health...she asked for a psychologist (now in a kind of private health system) the first therapist she saw told her that she HAD to feel mad to her mother for committing suicide and abandoned her like any non important animal. (I know, it's infuriating) 

It was until this year (that my job allowed me to pay expensive doctors) that one of them recommended EMDR therapy. Of course I didn't know it existed until she told me, now I know that this kind of therapy is special for people who have experienced trauma (I love doing my research).

Anyway, back to the initial point...my mom had to go to multiple doctors, tell them her trauma (feel bad for weeks after telling her story again) and wait 30 years for her daughter to find an alternative that could help her. I can't even imagine how so many people in poverty affected by war or just sick society, are going to know that there is a special kind of therapy for them and even if they knew, it can be so expensive (at least 50 USD per appointment and an appointment per week). This is not only about misogyny (although my mom would hate having a male therapist) but about capitalist itself..."

I recently got some lifestyle advice from my psychiatrist that could work for u too: exercise at least 20 minutes a day, spend sometime under the sunlight, be sorrounded by nature from time to time, spend just few hours alone, quit caffeine and read a David Burns book about anxiety.

I've been doing it for 3 days and it's been a bit lighter to carry on, maybe too soon to know but it's worth trying.

Wish the best for you :) I'm confident your situation will improve.

Anxiety,f23by0l,t3_dbku7a,1569915754.0,"I can definitely relate to your story... although I was able to get close romantically speaking I would freak out to get out with this uncertainty. I'm now seeing a therapist and I got to understand that social phobia has a lot to do with low self-esteem and shame of who you are (at least it was like that for me) so, first advice would be look for professional help, you can totally improve your situation. If you can't, start by improving your self-esteem by validating/accepting your feelings, your wants and maybe thinking objectively what's the chance of the the worst scenario to happen? And if it happens why wouldn't you be able to handle it? 

Oh! And I agree with the other comment, accept the scary feeling of exposing yourself, it'll diminish every time you face it and it will only grow if you avoid it.

I'm sure you're stronger than you think! You've somehow managed your fears and that's brave :)
Big hug for u and I hope everything goes better."
Anxiety,f23bc9c,t3_dbnyg1,1569914793.0,"Yes! Not specifically schizophrenia but I made my research for every different diagnosis I thought could be related to me...in the end I just had my generalized anxiety but I felt this need to know what else could be happening to me. (I also thought I had diabetes until I asked a doctor...)

Now I'm seeing a psychologist and she has helped me to see myself as a normal person that doesn't need to be labelled or defined by a diagnosis. Anyway, if you feel like you may suffer from any illness, from my experience it's better to look for professional advice and believe them. If you don't trust a first opinion, look for a second one and then let it go."
Anxiety,f22sw4c,t1_f1vtfk1,1569896250.0,"I think it's because I'm afraid of being rejected  or not likable.... lately I've been in an environment full of elite class people and me coming from a middle class family...feel even more out of place...I'm working on it though.
