In my country, although not all the time, some brand new books are covered tightly with plastic that you have to remove to actually read them. Although that seems like something that was more common before, because now, while trying to recount the most recent time I bought a book, I think it wasn't covered in plastic at all. Lol. And here, once you remove that, most people prefer to cover them with plastic 'sleeves' so as to preserve the cover of the books."

TaylorSwift,fptori5,t3_gfdim5,1588895268.0,"I think so! I've been a big fan since her first album up to Red. 

Then I got busy with life and when I first heard the 1989 singles, I was too affected by what I read on the media on how different she is now. I let it get to me and became disinterested in her. I didn't even bother to try to digest the meaning of her songs then. I just heard my friends saying that she looks weird in the Blank Space video and judged her without bothering to get beneath the surface and see it's actually a satire. 

When the reputation era came around, I was definitely intrigued with her deleting her entire IG. But when LWYMMD was released, it was still too different for my taste so I was disinterested yet again. 

Then came the reputation tour on Netflix. My workmates were watching it one time in the office and I was completely taken back to the good old days when I watched her perform Style/Love Story/You Belong With Me mashup. It was such a magical feeling that I decided to download the movie and watched it on my own at home. Watching the rep tour was soooo emotional for me. I fell in love with her new songs, and I realized that she hasn't changed at all. This is still the same Taylor I fell in love with before. She still has that amazing songwriting skill but it's just masked with a different production style. I started reading up articles on what happened to her before and all about the Kimye issue. God, I was so ashamed of myself for judging her. Since then, rep was on repeat for me everytime and it became something special for me because of how it's the album that brought me back to the fandom. I even went back to 1989 and realized what a freakin masterpiece that album was.

Being back in the fandom, I was super pumped for Lover and don't get me wrong, I loooove this album and this era. But reputation feels like home to me now.


TLDR; I was a fan since debut but got swayed by the media since 1989. Watched rep tour on Netflix and it brought me back and made me realize how wrong I am. rep has a special place in my heart now."
