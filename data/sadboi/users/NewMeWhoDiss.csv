teenmom,fp47zw0,t3_gb830n,1588293522.0,Bro.
MurderedByWords,fp46b4a,t1_fp3hj8x,1588292551.0,Not an original one either.
BPD,fp3u00g,t3_gavtxu,1588285777.0,"Congratulations!! So amazing!! USE your skills. Use them every day, all the time. And if it comes to it and you feel like you may need to go back, there's no shame in it. Proud of you!"
BPD,fp3l1q1,t1_fp3kdzd,1588281179.0,I've not! Thank you for sharing this!
BPD,fp2pzrs,t1_fp2jg6t,1588265949.0,My kids are the reason I do it. And one is currently snuggled up on my chest taking a nap.
BPD,fp20rde,t1_fp1c97o,1588252677.0,"I worry about this too. I've been more aware of it, and it's nice when I can read a post and think, ""Damn, these issues run DEEP,"" rather than, ""Me too, girl, me too."""
BPD,fp20ipg,t1_fp12h8y,1588252517.0,Did Lineharn's DBT. No longer meet the criteria to be diagnosed with BPD :)
BPD,fp0dpne,t1_fp0dizn,1588207282.0,"Thank you, kind stranger! I'm going to take you up on it :)"
BPD,fp0d053,t1_fp0cas1,1588206896.0,"I would definitely urge you to make that post. I would love to see more DBT around here, as I've completed the course (hopefully starting round 2 of it very soon), and I'd love to have a community of us who want to sharpen our skills and encourage each other to handle our shit and do better each day. My diagnosis is not a crutch. I will never succumb to that."
BPD,fp0bp84,t1_fozn9f2,1588206190.0,"I'm starting to shy away from the sub for this reason. I don't want to start to identify with shit that isn't me. A lot of the things here aren't me, but I'm like, ""oh yeah totally"" in my brain. There was one the other day (""I'm sick of being a ruiner"" or something like that) that was tremendously helpful for me though."
BPD,foz5bis,t1_fousbh2,1588184936.0,This makes me unreasonably happy.
BPD,fovh6li,t3_g9jba3,1588101251.0,"This hits SO HARD.

I was having a moment, so I excused myself to get in the bath which is where I can best find wise mind. I opened up reddit and came about this post. THANK YOU for helping me feel less alone. You have articulated what I've struggled to for years. I sent the page to my boyfriend. 

I wish I had the answers or words to help you, but my cup is also empty. Just know that I hear you, I feel you, I understand you, I hurt for you, and I hope we'll get through this."
Ticketmaster,fmq8sq6,t3_fwqp92,1586295021.0,"Ticketmaster is the literal fucking worst. I'm so sorry this happened. I, too, am in a very similar boat, and there's NOTHING I can do. I hate this feeling because I want to light them on fire, but I'm powerless. I just hope there's a class action suit and we can burn the entire organization to the fucking ground."
AskReddit,fmlnbof,t1_fmkpqlh,1586189709.0,"Tried it once. I did not try to vomit intentionally, but I consented to the act knowing that it (vomiting) would not be voluntary. There was a guy who had a kink for really rough oral sex to where I gagged until I vomited. After having experienced it once, and it is not something I'd consent to again. It just wasn't for me. Plus, I was left with burst blood vessels all over my face and neck from gagging so violently--it was unsightly!"
AskReddit,fmjkzr8,t1_fmhfh5v,1586132428.0,Yup. Have tried both.
AskReddit,fmgu7qy,t1_fmgjy05,1586057955.0,Bingo!

SkincareAddiction,fmbyjit,t1_fmbtezv,1585935573.0,I will try this! Thank you
SkincareAddiction,fmbyiiq,t1_fmbjvza,1585935558.0,Holy crap! I'm so looking into this. Does it hurt like a beast?
FemaleDatingStrategy,fhjdq7y,t1_fhjdego,1581643658.0,I'm with you girl. Me on top facing him hurts. I really enjoy reverse cowgirl.
BPD,fhdd4k0,t3_f2hg5f,1581482891.0,"Don't message him again. If/when it ever comes up, just let him know you were being cheeky/sassy/flirty/playful/what-have-you."

BPD,fh9a2xw,t3_f1ybom,1581376507.0,"Congrats!!! DBT was a total game changer for me. I still struggle A LOT, especially now that I'm a few month past my DBT course. But that shit is so amazing and helpful. I wish everyone could have an amazing DBT therapist--we all deserve to find peace."

BPD,fh8p3tx,t1_fh87x26,1581364444.0,"Each skill has its place, but in general, I'm a big fan of the ""observe"" skill. It settles my mind and I'm able to sort of hypnotize myself. It helps me stay balanced because my mind isn't capable of processing massive emotions while being 100% engrossed in something neutral I'm observing (I like to observe my sense of touch and sight the most)."
BPD,fh87lay,t3_f1slxc,1581353783.0,"I hear ya, and DBT definitely felt hoaky to me for quite a while. One I really committed to it, I was all in. I love it now."
BPD,fh8729x,t3_f1shh7,1581353455.0,"Um no. No no no to all of this. I've been to countless shrinks and therapists and have taken every medication known to man. It wasn't until I found my therapist who specializes in emotion management and BPD that I got actual help. For me, it's VITAL."
BPD,fh7948b,t1_fh79274,1581320112.0,You are lovable. You are going to find your person--this guy just isn't it. I'm so glad his toxic ass lives far away from you.
BPD,fh78wr5,t1_fh76h19,1581319850.0,"Oh god it's the literal fucking WORST. I'm trying to handle it right. And yet here I am, blowing up his phone with the longest walls of texts you've ever seen, and he wants nothing to do with me.

To be fair though, your guy sounds like a colossal piece of shit (based on your description anyway). My vote says you're better off without him. I know that doesn't help to hear though."
BPD,fh754tn,t3_f1ltoe,1581315484.0,"Girl, I don't have advice to offer, I just wanted to let you know that I too went through a breakup today. My heart is also broken. I'm also snotty and gross and unable to sleep with work in a few hours. It's the worst, but you're not alone."
