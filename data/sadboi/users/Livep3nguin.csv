Something that really helps me is drawing and writing out my emotions. My drawings and writing usually aren't very good, but they helps me put my emotions into something tangible. Another thing that could help is confessing to a friend. It might be really hard, but I promise it works. If they're a good friend they'll give you a shoulder to lean on and let you give them updates about how you're feeling. It gives you a good outlet for your emotions, and, if you promise them that you won't kill yourself, and you really mean it at the time, it'll be that much harder when all the thoughts and emotions, all the terrible, horrible emotions, come crashing down all at once."
