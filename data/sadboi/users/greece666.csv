raisedbynarcissists,fr46gt3,t3_gmjkds,1589877486.0,"I had a similar situation with my father. He went bananas when I was in primary school. We never got a diagnosis but he got the symptoms of a mania: he thought he would save the world, that he was a unique genius and more important than other humans. At the same time, he believed he was persecuted (""the Jews/Masons/communists are after me""). Nothing ever was an accident, every misfortune was maliciously premeditated by someone.

The key part is what you write in your title: like your mother, my mother chose to support him. Instead of pushing him to get medical help, she pushed him in the opposite direction, which led to a series of disastrous decisions. Before long, his professional career was destroyed. To this day, I cannot put in words the anger I feel when I recall what my mother did. She literally pushed him down a cliff.

What's worse, she repeatedly told me that ""I was the only one who could help my father"" and that it was my duty to reason him. Who the fucks talks like this to a 12 yo?  And although I wasnt living in a foreign country, my father's persecution syndrom fuelled lots of hasted changes of towns and schools which greatly contributed to my isolation.

Does your school have a counselling service? You ll need a counsellor to get through this. Just don't tell this to your parents, I'm worried they ll try to stop you. PM me if you feel it can help.

PS this is absolutely the right place to post this, your parents are being major assholes."
