In other words, they completely understand that there are biological differences between the male and female sex, hence why they take hormones, but they would argue that Gender is separate, and stems from the mind."

It's fine for you to choose to live life how ever you want, the point is that some people DO NOT want to choose what you choose. The point is the YOUR choices effect OTHER people, and you are not allowed to infringe on THEIR RIGHT TO CHOOSE a less risky life style. As others have noted:

Can you just not camp for a few more weeks? How about that? Its really not that hard, and you could help prevent another 9/11's worth of America lives being lost on a daily basis by just staying home.

>Don't touch shit without gloves if you're that concerned about the virus with a .1% fatality rate, the same virus that **most people have it and are asymptomatic.**

**That fact that 50% of people who have it, are asymptomatic, is exactly why it is so dangerous.** You can unknowingly infect anyone you come across. Masks and gloves are only as effective as the people using them. For example, if you have a mask on but still touch your face to adjust it, game over. If you don't know how to properly take gloves off, game over.

Yes. Please do. So far I only feel embarrassed for YOUR lack of common sense, patience, consideration for others, and your ability to do any kind of proper research on a subject before getting so emotional about it.
