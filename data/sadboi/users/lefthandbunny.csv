Then I got sucked into the youtube physical therapy rabbit hole, but it helped me heal at least! Then there's the rabbit hole of patterns & yarn colors...

I do the alarm/timer thing as well, to try to stop compulsively doing things, but then I'll just reset it for another hour, over & over."

Showerthoughts,fok9725,t1_fohx935,1587837746.0,"50% of the reason I don't cook is no dishwasher, a single sink (one side only) & a very small counter (ONE!) to dry the dishes on. I have a table that has my microwave & it's where I place pre-made food onto my paper plates & vitamins & daily used stuff that won't fit elsewhere. I used to be big on baking & cooking- good enough that the biggest fight in my last divorce was refusing to give my ex my recipe for his favorite dish. Probably the only thing I miss about a bigger place is a good kitchen with counter space, a 2 sided sink & a dishwasher."
Showerthoughts,fohs0dd,t1_fohqoej,1587771517.0,"I live in a one room studio by myself & never have people over. I have 1 small counter & a one-sided small sink. I've resorted (don't hate on me) to paper plates for the most part, so few dishes (1 plate, 1 bowl, 1 set of silverware, a couple of cups & mugs). You'd think I'd clean daily with a smaller space, but since it's just me I don't care much. I don't leave stuff laying around, but the dust on the furniture & tiles can wait."

Showerthoughts,fohqwx3,t1_fohoqkp,1587770918.0,"Oh, I have nothing at all against the game makers who make their games that way. I'm all for everyone enjoying any game they want to. I've tried adjusted all my setting & it just doesn't work, so I just try other games til I find one that doesn't make me want to hurl. I'm a bit jealous of everyone who isn't bothered by those features. Enjoy your gaming!"
MadeMeSmile,fohqf2q,t1_fohfrl6,1587770649.0,"I used to have horrible body issues. This was back in the day before social media pictures of ""perfect bodies"". I quit buying magazines with all the ""perfect bodies"". It helped me a lot. It may help you, along with avoiding social media as much as possible.

EDIT for my other past issues: I also have a big bubble butt & large full lips. When I was young these were considered some of the worst traits for a woman to have. I'm a bit jealous that it's now  considered an ideal."
CozyPlaces,fohp4kw,t1_fofb3nw,1587769917.0,Searched for this to see if it'd already been posted! Agree!
crochet,fohoupy,t3_g78lax,1587769759.0,"Thanks for posting this. It's odd that I always recommend people to do small square to learn new stitches, but I'd never thought to do this to teach myself corner to corner. I have memory issues so can't follow the big corner to corner patterns. This might be doable for me!  = )"
LifeProTips,fohoagj,t1_fohk9yc,1587769437.0,"I get to a point where I just say, I respect your opinion, but I disagree & am ending this conversation. If they reply with more debate I ignore it."
Showerthoughts,fohnxiz,t1_foghnw7,1587769233.0,I kind of disagree with this. For girls older names are back in style. Many of my nieces have named their babies old fashioned names. One is named after her great grandma & has friends with what you'd consider old names.
Showerthoughts,fohnnz8,t1_fohadg5,1587769085.0,"I'll admit that I do play games that have less buttons to press. I don't understand the need for all the buttons. The controllers have also gotten a bit larger & I have small hands, so it's awkward for me to play. I still play though. Fall Out New Vegas has been my latest favorite & I'm a female in my late 50's.  I've also developed vertigo badly enough that I avoid some games (changing frame rate doesn't fix it for me). I took benadryl to play a game where you had to train by rolling in the grass & I got so nauseous! Not willing to keep doing that though. I prefer to play solo & was quite angry when the second Guild Wars was only multi-player.  I'd built my own gaming computer to play the first Guild Wars & even built a gaming computer for my son so he could play."
Showerthoughts,fohml7v,t1_fogc1h9,1587768481.0,I thought this was why there are different modes on the games I play?
Showerthoughts,fohm90x,t1_fohfco3,1587768309.0,"Opposite here. Then again, without little germ monsters around it's not such a health hazard to not do a deep clean weekly & a pick-up & wipe down daily."
PandR,fohkt5z,t1_fofyl6q,1587767624.0,"My antenna doesn't get NBC, any ideas if it will stream or be on youtube soon after? Yes, I have tried EVERY antenna available, I can't do a rooftop antenna, I just have to deal with it using streaming."
BipolarReddit,fohjlos,t3_g7dopm,1587767048.0,"For all of you that claim this is psychosis or delusional thinking, what if other people were present & have the same memory of the incident? I've had things happen, more than once, and others were there & agreed those things did happen. I keep a journal as well & write things down immediately after happening as I tend to think that it's just false memory. 

Example: I once had a boyfriend that I hadn't seen in years. I suddenly felt very worried for him & was desperate to contact him.  It's a long story, so I'm going to just give a synopsis.  I called his aunt & she was angry that I called & said he had a new girlfriend & I should stop calling & move on. She did finally tell me where he worked, but begged me to leave him alone. I kept trying to contact him all night. I finally found out that he was late getting home as a worker who'd been fired the previous day had come back to his job & done a mass shooting. My ex was okay. It was on the news. I'd called my best friend when I was worrying as it took a few hours for me to find out what had happened. She saw the story on the news about the shooting. I never felt the urge to contact him again."
NoStupidQuestions,fohhr9y,t1_foh3g5t,1587766187.0,"Well, I feel like an idiot now. My friend & I walked out of a concert as it was way too loud back in the 80's. We'd been super excited to go,  it was Yngwie Malmsteen, but it was just too loud. We'd never even thought of ear plugs."

Your  blanket is beautiful!"
