However I also believe in science and that we are born this way depending on the genes we are given and people might want to be a boy or a girl and can get a sex change. 

You are right, we do need to take action and accept ourselves and ofc it's much easier said then done. But if you realize that the body you currently have is not and never will be in your control. You can't control your height, skin colour ect, and people might give you shit for it but again I ask the question, why should we worry about something that is not under our control? We cannot change it and since we can't change it why shouldn't we love ourselves? Only we know who we truly are and I know for a fact that everyone is special and beautiful in their own way. 

What matters is on the inside and how you bring that out into your daily life, not your body. Body's grow old and change every couple of months they're never the same. But how you act with yourself and society is what makes people truely beautiful. 

(Sorry for the long para)"

With him saying it's not a big deal shows how he's not sorry for what he done and has no remorse for it. Especially since his online logs show a pattern of this behaviour. 

Tbh I would say you should do more than just that"

depression,fpddglo,t3_gcqww5,1588524824.0,"Honestly. I would say talking about what's caused the depression is the best way to face it heard on. Find someone you're comfortable telling all the stuff to, could be family, a friend or even a stranger, and slowly talk to them about it. Bit by bit. It will help you confront the problems at hand and the other person might be able to give you good advice too 

That's how I dealt with my issues. I couldn't talk to therapists or anything but I could talk to people I knew and kinda just ended up blurting some stuff out one day. And honestly it really helped. 

Hope you try it. Good luck"

For all the bullshit they've put you through. Even if it's a tiny bit of evidence for each encounter it's gonna pile up and screw them."
AmItheAsshole,fdddfbu,t3_ekodtv,1578307002.0,Nta at all. I'm allergic to severely allergic to buts and ik the feeling. I would be a lot more pissed off than you were
