I don't think *you* understand what flattening the curve means. It means prolonging the distribution of the spread so that our hospital resources weren't overloaded. (See: [this graphic from the New York Times](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/22/science/11SCI-VIRUS-CURVE1/11SCI-VIRUS-TRACKER1-superJumbo.jpg)) What you are describing seems to be the top of the curve, where the rate of new cases starts to decrease.

We have long gotten past that [to the point where our hospitals are empty and going bankrupt](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sending-hospitals-into-bankruptcy-11587326607). Basic epidemiology requires getting to the point of herd immunity from exposure or a vaccine. Either we should loosen restrictions, or stay inside and bank on there being a vaccine (which may NEVER be developed, as is the case for thousands of viruses)"
