Edit: I thought more about this over the past few days and let me just add! 

Even if this child DID do it on purpose- she is showing genuine remorse for her actions! And that friends is how children learn. Through making mistakes! And guess how many times it takes for one thing to be learnt fully? Well it’s hundreds at the very least - depending on what’s happening. This little girl might be doing it purposely but she is learning that doing it isn’t right and she wants to fix her mistake and all she knows is to change her shorts because her whole world (her parents) will pick her up in the afternoon and she’s likely hates to disappoint them!

The teacher needs to realise that it’s not a game for that child and it’s not a competition!

AskReddit,fqg3w0v,t1_fqcpng5,1589337430.0,"The case which I was referring to was an 11 yo child (who’s now an adult) case where she was trying to prove that the 16yo son of her then current foster care family was raping her every Friday when he was left alone in the house with her. The defence claimed she was lying of course and they kept asking the same questions in different ways - to which she had different answers. They asked when the abuse started and stuff. Which was on days that weren’t Friday (just other occasions when he had managed to get alone with her) and then it continued to happen at random days and finally settled to a routine of each Friday. Well because she didn’t answer exactly the same days the parents and defence claimed she was lying because all other days the turd had extra curricular activities - these other occasions to which she couldn’t recall dates - *of course she was traumatised and it happened numerous times - plus she was 11* - were times when the shithead didn’t have whatever extra curricular activity that he normally did cause of cancellations! 

She was a pretty traumatised kid and didn’t really trust adults at that point and eventually she just gave up. It sickened me to know how kids can get treated and their evidence just laughed at. Like I can’t even imagine being that defence lawyer...did they really think she was lying or did they just need to win for the 16yo and his parents? That one will go to the grave with them! 

She was sent back to that house but she kept running away and eventually was placed in a residential group home. She became ward of the state as she was too difficult to place. She grew up to be a drug addict but she is now clean 2 years and has custody of all her 3 kiddos.

To get in you have to pass two sets of security. It was for lodging a DVO and they just want u in and out it’s legit just a formality u being there. The judge is usually tired and crabby from hearing all the stupid reasons why people get these orders - a lot of victims are reoccurring because they keep getting back with their abusive ex partners and I think they are just acts of spite.

AskReddit,fqb7eu8,t3_ghu612,1589231889.0,"Women giving birth. They never seem to have to deliver the placenta or cut the chord. Labour is intense immediately and delivery happens within a minute or so. 

IRL you can start off with bearable contractions and pressure and be 36 hours before delivery and often push for 20-45 mins, the placenta is an almost immediate priority- and it requires a push most of the time and hurts because it’s an extra contraction. They take the baby and immediately after cutting the chord and suction it’s mouth and nose - often on a separate table in the corner and then wipe away the face but everything else can stay and they wrap the baby in a blanket dirty and naked bar a fast nappy they popped on (sometimes). Usually they only care that the baby has a beanie on. They usually weigh the baby in this time too lol. They act really fast. They have to observe the placenta and take notes on it - they discuss this out loud and measure the chords length. In Australia in the public system midwives deliver babies without drs present most of the time and they just call the doctor or wait for them to do the rounds to sign off on the birth and notes.
