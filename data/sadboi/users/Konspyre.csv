From experience I was able to get through a semester for music production.. it had a whole lot of lows and highs and I was pretty much in your exact position before starting.

My advice..

Make sure you're in the best health as possible (as others have mentioned) 

It really helps to have one friend.. someone you can relate to in the course.. Trust me, there will be at least one.

In class, take all the notes possible and don't leave your assessment too late.

Taking notes in class is key. Also, never hesitate to ask questions in class, it builds confidence.

Think of it like working out or meditating or having a strict diet.

Some days that person just wants to stay in bed and do neither of these things. To discipline you must go out of your own way to achieve these things.

I remember getting seriously anxious on lunch breaks because we would sit at a table with 4 people and sometimes I just had to get the hell out of there and sit by myself and listen to music on my phone.
