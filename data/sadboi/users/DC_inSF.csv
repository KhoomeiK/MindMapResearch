Anxiety,fnnrmaq,t3_g28zce,1587099707.0,Dude I was eating M&Ms earlier and one “tasted weird” so I threw the rest away and drank a bunch of water and had a two hour panic attack. Like... yeah I’m sure it was a poisoned M&M. Why are we like this???!
Anxiety,flocmgp,t3_fpzhti,1585335723.0,"I’m so happy I woke up with the hot face anxiety like “I have a fever! I’m clearly dying!” And you mentioned this. My anxiety symptoms are SO physical and they totally rotate. The dizziness is my least favorite normally but considering this pandemic I hate the chest tightness and hot skin extra. I tried to tell my therapist my anxiety wasn’t some irritating constant “overthinking” I can get past with platitudes and inspirational quotes, that it’s very physical in nature, and he was like “wHaT dO yOu MeAn iTs PhYsIcAL??” You guys get it. You guys understand."

crochet,fllmr24,t1_fllby5n,1585263525.0,Dude same actually it’s really lumpy no matter what yarn I use! Getting it wet or steaming it seems to help
Anxiety,flevv88,t1_fle2wxp,1585092571.0,I just laughed for the first time in a week thank you 😂
Anxiety,fkzn0x0,t3_flkx2r,1584674923.0,Look up “alternate nostril breathing” and practice it. I swear it’s magic. I don’t know why but it works on me like nothing else does. I’ve stopped many a panic attack this way.
Anxiety,fkzmwjl,t3_flkj0h,1584674835.0,"I’m in San Francisco and been feeling the same for about a week. I go between thinking “meh it’s spring, I have allergies” to CERTAINTY I’m dying from Covid-19. It’s awful. I can’t get a moment of peace. My husband thinks it’s pure anxiety."
Anxiety,fkw3437,t3_fkayil,1584582374.0,"This thread helped me sleep last night. Bless this post. I’m in San Francisco on lockdown and constantly feeling my throat, taking my temperature, breathing deeply and thinking “WHY DOES IT FEEL LIKE THIS?!?!” Convinced I have it. My husband keeps telling me that even if I had it I’d be okay but it doesn’t matter. My brain pictures me suffocating to death on a ventilator and I can’t deal with any logic. I can’t relax. I can barely function."
Anxiety,fkteol8,t1_fksf1jm,1584516483.0,I didn’t know that was a fear other people had wow... BIG SAME. Hang in there
CampingGear,f3ab19c,t1_f3a889i,1570766664.0,I’m sure it’ll be a great tent! My experience was hopefully an outlier. Happy trails :)
CampingGear,f39t622,t3_dfyt08,1570755232.0,FWIW my Marmot Tungsten’s zipper failed after less than a year and they have refused to fix or replace it or even return my emails. I’d go with another brand. I did love the tent while it worked but I have never had such a bad experience with warranty and customer service before!
