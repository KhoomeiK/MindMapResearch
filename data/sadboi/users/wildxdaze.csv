fuckeatingdisorders,fp3t0ew,t3_gb0geq,1588285259.0,"Firstly, I'm so sorry to hear you're having a difficult time. It's really brave of your to share your experience!

If it's available keep pushing your doctor / GP /for  exploring different options for your skin until you find something that works for you. 

I see you tagged as not yet in recovery: have you considered reaching out for support for Orthorexia? I didn't feel like I was in need of/deserving of support for a long time with my disorder, I began with symptoms of Orthorexia and it progressively got more difficult to manage and later developed into Anorexia. 

I went through cycles of painful acne during changing my diet and moving countries: the stress of this can effect the skin, too. 

I know it can feel intimidating but you deserve recovery: always. And of course - this is your safe space to share whatever's on your mind or in need of support .

Wishing you all the best x"
mentalhealth,fof3tcj,t1_fof3hr8,1587725022.0,"I'm not sure what your situation is in terms if whether or not you are being referred to a therapist via a health system or if you are selecting a therapist yourself? 

Either way, take your initial session and this will give you a good idea of how you feel with this person. Of course, in hindsight it may take a couple of sessions to feel truly comfortable opening up to your therapist but you may be able to get a sense if it's going to be ideal!"
mentalhealth,fo4nbs9,t3_g5nz24,1587507555.0,"Firstly - well done for reaching out for support and good luck on your therapy journey!

There are a few factors to consider. Searching for a therapist that you feel comfortable sharing with is important and in turn may help you feel more progression towards reaching the goals you set within your therapy.

It can also be useful to have an idea of what your intentions are. Maybe take a moment to reflect on whether there's anything you would like to address in particular with your therapist. 

All the best."
EatingDisorders,fn19r0q,t3_fykxbp,1586557615.0,"Firstly, I think it's really brave and inspiring that you're taking this step into trying something new within your recovery. It can definitely feel daunting trying something new. I have personally tried support groups both in person & online. It can feel really grounding to speak with/see other people that understand some difficult feelings and to feel a part of a community that is looking out for each other, supporting each other's recovery! 

I was really nervous before my first in-person support group, when we all shared/introduced ourselves I just openly said it was my first time there and I was super nervous to be a part of it  - everyone was so lovely & welcoming! 

Maybe you could write a couple of intentions before your call to check in with what you're hoping to explore from the support groups so you feel a little calmer going into it? 

Usually, there is someone leading the group - you could always reach out to them separately to chat about the way the zoom meet will be held/a heads up if/or if there will be any questions if it makes you feel a little more at ease, I'm sure they'd be more than happy to chat!

Wishing you all the best in this next chapter you deserve recovery and happiness! ❤"
EatingDisorders,fk5m9eb,t1_fk3jof8,1583883409.0,"I've never experienced as much gaslighting as this before, It's really difficult to have conversations in any way confrontational without it being: my fault. Every, damn, time. He told me he wouldn't apologise for the weight comment, he said I hadn't set my boundaries so even tho he knows of my ED I hadn't shared with him that weight comments would effect me... again: My fault! Glad I ended it, healing is coming!"
EatingDisorders,fk5lyg7,t1_fk3p7m5,1583883231.0,Thank you for your honest words here... I'm absolutely not going back. I'm going to stand rooted in this decision and will be a huge lesson for the future. I hope your close one is safe & sound.
EatingDisorders,fk5lkdz,t1_fk3qsq0,1583882998.0,"thank you so much! I'm glad I have been able to see through a lot of manipulations that have built up - there's been a few instances of gaslighting which only continued through our break up conversation. I also think it's super unnerving when someone *tells* you how *you* feeling when it's really far from the mark, makes you feel like you're losing the plot. None of that in my life, please + thank you!"
EatingDisorders,fk5l7lq,t1_fk3nqng,1583882790.0,"Thank you, I'm sticking by my decision to put my recovery first. It'll be the first time since my early teens that I'll be truly single (without dating/seeing others) and I'm 24. Sounds silly, it's bloody scary. But I know this is what my gut is telling me to do. Glad I drew the line now!"
EatingDisorders,fk5l398,t1_fk3w6sw,1583882717.0,Thank you!!
EatingDisorders,fk5kzqo,t1_fk4jn4i,1583882659.0,"Thank you. He also keeps sending me really long texts, and messaging my friend... ahh! it's so intense! However, the messages are only further affirming my decision to end it with him. I know i'll be grateful when I look back, although this feels difficult right now!"
offmychest,fjomler,t3_fefm9x,1583530806.0,"I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. I just want to tell you that you deserve recovery and happiness, and I know it probably doesn't feel possible right now - but it will happen. 

There's always options and one of those options will work for you: even if it takes a couple of shots to find something that you truly align with. Support groups, communities, helplines, recovery blogs, coaches - even something like taking up a new class of sorts or a new volunteering project? 

Sending you so much love."
EatingDisorders,fjngqex,t1_fjne6nv,1583507017.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience with me!

Since this conversation we took some time apart, we did meet again and quite honestly I feel a shift and I'm unsure I'll be able to work through this funk with him as he keeps saying he doesn't ""want a heavy relationship"" which implies to me he sees my disorders/recovery as too heavy for him (i get it, it's tough, but I haven't implied it's his responsibility). 

I'm also struggling to find the confidence, energy and words to end it with him. He's not going to walk away easily, equally, I really don't like to upset people. Feelings!!"
EatingDisorders,fjng5yf,t1_fjndo10,1583506649.0,"Thank you, I'm struggling to build the confidence to break it off, he seems very good at spinning every thought or concern I have into a positive. It's going to be difficult to navigate a break up with this dude"
relationships,f9f98f1,t1_f9f09p5,1575263168.0,The fear of losing our friendship outweighs how much I'm digging the idea of it happening again!
relationships,f9dxwtw,t1_f9dw79q,1575237829.0,I've always seen the flirting and closeness as a part of our friendship but this is where I feel I could be completely overlooking some feelings that are more than a friendship. The next day over breakfast she was back to discussing her current boy troubles so I can't help but feel extremely confused by it all haha
relationships,f87ji23,t3_dz87w6,1574334699.0,"Just want to tell you your feelings are valid and you have every reason to be confused about his distance. You gave him space and respected his boundaries now he needs to meet you in the middle and communicate with you why he is being distant - pushing you away is unfair. I have been in your position, I can't speak for you but I just want to let you know that you deserve to be treated well! Relationships take work but you have every right to share how it's making you feel. 

I agree with some others here, bring it to an end and the logistics will come along with it! Usually a lot smoother than we envision because naturally we always want things to work out :)"
LushCosmetics,epd5qky,t3_buif6z,1559162284.0,I worked for lush UK for 2 years 2016-2018 - just returned from travelling a year and 1/2 and I’m going for another position.. the company has grown in many ways - always going to be your usual retail sector pressures of hitting budgets but generally you’ll find it’s full of beautifully empowering / encouraging people. I still find lush is very different to any other job I have had in regards to building consultations and how customer service is delivered but that’s what makes it super special as it challenges you to build on your communication skills. There are only going to be more and more opportunities within the company as it grows. Go for it! ✨
