awakened,fqprnra,t1_fqodsem,1589552695.0,"I agree. It’s too exhausting to look and I am tired of it all. 

There are times when I wish I could find someone but it’s too hard."

SuicideBereavement,ezjql7a,t3_d176pg,1567948767.0,"As a mom who lost her only son to suicide, for me it was beyond devastating.   I knew he struggled with depression and severe anxiety and did do many things to try to help him.  I thought he had turned the corner and was doing better, so I was completely blindsided by it.  I still miss him every day.  💔"
SuicideBereavement,ey9s4fz,t3_cw8qpt,1566951136.0,The odds go way up.  I know of a family where the father died by suicide and the daughter followed suit.  The thought has entered my mind but I couldn’t do it to my daughter.  It’s very difficult to keep going sometimes.
SuicideBereavement,evzgelk,t3_cly9ii,1564956964.0,"I say never, totally, after having lost my son 30 months ago.  The first year, I was really just on auto pilot-basically in shock.  The second year was actually worse in many ways because the shock started to wear off.  I am in the third year now.  Still very hard, at times, but time does help.  I will miss him until the day I die, but I am trying to live my life as best I can because he urged me to do that in the letter he left me😥."
