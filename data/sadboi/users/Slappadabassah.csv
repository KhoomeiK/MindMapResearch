depression,f5satx8,t1_f5qzf2k,1572419983.0,"Well I write non fiction anything  - novels, scripts etc when I have the time anyways - I don’t publish, it’s just for me. Have done ever since I was little and just whatever I would want for my life in that moment I write a script or story about it and write myself in it. Even if I changed the protagonists name, I know it’s me. I just make her the person I wish I could be. 

The fantasy I create depends on what I’m into in that moment. When I was teenager I was obsessed with movies like Dazed & Confused and music from that era, so I wrote a whole novel about a girl in high school in the 70s. Just random ass shit like that. 

And then every spare moment I get, I’ll just dive into that particular story that I’m into. Even if it’s just in my head at night, I’ll escape into that “world” because I’m happier in it. I don’t know, it sounds weird “saying” it out loud. 

I suppose it wouldn’t be considered weird if I published any of it haha. Guess that’s what writers do at the end of the day. Apparently you can make a lot of money writing fan fiction these days, I missed my calling."

No, he’s not an asshole about it, he genuinely tries to understand - just ignorant. Comes from a background of “being sad is weak”. He absolutely tries though, I’ll give him that. I just don’t have the patience or the will to talk about it all the time. Easier to fake a smile."

I totally take comfort artists who are able to express how I feel and thereby making me feel a little less alone."

Do what you can for the next meal, fuck I don’t know.  Try something different. Fuck it what do you have to lose if you want to kill yourself anyways? Escape but in a different way, it’s worth a fucking shot."
depression,ezwehzn,t3_cpidz8,1568214805.0,"I’m literally a grown 31 year old woman crying and thinking about bailing on my relationship, job, friends and responsibilities and moving back in with my parents who are in another state just because “I wanna go home”. Don’t even know what that means anymore or if that would help anything but ...Jesus, I can relate."
