AskWomen,fqpx79p,t3_gk2rxw,1589555619.0,"When I was in the 8th grade, there was this one guy that ALWAYS picked on me. He would always make some sarcastic remark to every question I asked. He was really frustrating to learn around. Of course, he was one of those ‚ÄúJock-Douchebag‚Äù kind of guys. When I left middle school and went to a magnet high school, I was finally rid of him for good.

Flash forward to this past October.

I am now 21 in an Irish Pub having a good time. And I thought I spotted a couple of people from middle school there. Low and behold, there that guy stood‚Äînot too much different looking than before. But, I sure definitely do. I found him on Facebook and messaged him asking him if he was there and he messaged back yeah. I went over and talked to him for like maybe an hour and a half just catching up on everything. Completely new person from what I had met before.

He also wanted me to come over to his place SO badly afterwards."

AskWomen,fqhabjo,t3_gil16z,1589372428.0,"I worked at a shoe store for about a year and a half the begninng of college. I actually enjoyed my coworkers and I made about 7% commission off of the shoes I sold. Our boss at the time was going through a rough divorce and she had been taking a lot of her frustrations and angers toward some of us. It got to the point where I had to have a heart to heart with her and I let her tell me as much as she was willing to share. 

Months later, some of my coworkers were asking me if I had slept with a couple of the male employees. At the time I was in a long-term relationship. The people I were closest to were male, but obviously I said absolutely not. Apparently, my boss began to spread rumors that I was sleeping with the male coworkers. The men themselves went up to her and told her to stop.

Lastly, she hired her drinking buddy as an assistant manager, even though she had no experience except like maybe a factory job she recently got fired from. She never did her job, she sat in the back and played on her phone. She had me once rearrange the entire store and that store is not exactly small. I sat down for maybe a second and this woman screams at me in front of customers that I am lazy and how dare I sit down. By that point, I was really hating my life already as it was. I put in my two weeks notice the day after. I also found out that the assistant manager she hired had been stealing from the register for MONTHS and my former boss had just slammed the keys on the counter and walked out during tax free day. 

Dodged a MAJOR bullet."

I realized how much it would hurt if a man was looking at porn the same way I was while in a relationship and yeah I can see the damages. It can be extremely addicting, but screen will not always match reality and women will feel less confident in their bodies. I have not watched porn in months and I honestly feel a lot better. :) take with that what you will"
