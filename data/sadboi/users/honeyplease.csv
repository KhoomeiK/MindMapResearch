Bitwig,fqpyeoc,t1_fqpvv8x,1589556237.0,"All the glitches are done organically using modulation, no slicing ever is done and no audio processing in the sense of tweaking with the soundwave directly to glitch (like stretching for instance). Also no automation of any kind (other than the usual volumes here and there etc). I like to build glitch organically (also because I'm too lazy to slice, resample, chop, rearrange etc)."

Experimenting with glitch and mellow contrasting. Been trying to develop a style that merges electronic glitch with a bit more classical instruments. All stock instruments, plugins and samples except for: bass amp processor for the bass, Pianoteq for piano, and VSCO2 for strings."
linux,fpwksst,t1_fpsb90m,1588965202.0,Dude this IS great news. You will make a ton of Renoise users happy. I'm a Bitwig user myself and am only starting w Renoise that's why I had I so present --I can't help with testing there but I will try on bitwig soon^TM

I think I'm missing the point about Renoise because splitting a sample and then editing it in the editor seemed like it was THE thing I would be able to do (in my wrong understanding of it). If I can't organically place the sliced samples in the editor then what's the point? Is this not like the main thing Renoise is good for? I'm a pretty advanced user of other DAWs and I feel so lost right now I want mommy."
renoise,fnepfry,t1_fneocna,1586893508.0,"Given that I can barely navigate the GUI no I did not know :) I can see how its useful though, you can build a ton of variation with multiple phrases all being triggered from main editor, right?"
renoise,fnenaiz,t1_fnek721,1586892408.0,"Thanks. I would have thought this would a basic feature in a DAW like Renoise... A few other ones (much less sample mangling heavy) have it straightforward, Bitwig has a slice to drum machine/midi and puts it in the editor directly, I remember vaguely Live also has something like this. Anyway thanks for the pointer."

I think the reason for this is that in general businesses are for the most part too unsophisticated to use the kind of strategic insight that would come from such a framework. Inb4 ""Google and Facebook are not unsophisticated"", what I mean with this is the vast majority of businesses for whom ""AI"" is the future let's use big data omg omg.

kinbaku,ffwosy4,t3_evbtwk,1580307312.0,"Nice idea. A few questions:

1) How do you control for endogeneity? You would expect a selection bias driving results if you are comparing tokens / POS tags in BDSM vs vanilla tokens. 

2) Might have missed it from your explanation, but did you look at differences within BDSM users and for those same users across BDSM and vanilla subs?

The main concern here is that you're not controlling enough for context, i.e. language in BDSM subs *will* reflect more power-related words simply because it it the proper context (sub for it).
