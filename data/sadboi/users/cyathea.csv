You have chosen to try to hide it as much as you can, but your ability to do that is uncertain even if you continue to want to.   

You have been trying to prevent the truth from coming out but your family already know something is gone severely wrong, and that your brother seems to be involved.   

They likely have noticed you don't respond to touch as you used to, this is hard to fake convincingly.  So they may already have some idea of where the problem could be.

 You are only living with your family for as long as you have no choice.  The existing split will become physical too as soon as you are able to get away.  You won't want to come back as long as  he is there, and if you do for a special occasion there will be that split between you and him, and that will continue to poison your relationship with the rest of your family.  

Your age has a huge effect on your situation.  Therapy is expensive  so the details of your health insurance or parents' paying for it matters a lot.  You are not going to be fixed quickly.   

Your age also affects mandatory reporting, if you are under 18 your therapist might have to report to your family and CPS.  You can ask your therapist, but start by asking about confidentiality for non-reporting stuff.  I'd guess your parents won't be told anything without your permission but you should check.

To put that in context here is the most important article to read, a brief history of the knowledge senior executives at Exxon had about global warming from 1977 onwards.   

 James F Black, PhD, started working for Standard Oil (part of which later became Esso and then Exxon) during WW2. He had a distinguished career over 40 years, garnering dozens of patents through his wide-ranging research.  

In 1977 he briefed some of Exxon’s top executives about the risks of burning fossil fuels. A year later, recapping his presentation in an internal company memo, he wrote: “Present thinking holds that man has a time window of five to ten years before the need for hard decisions regarding changes in energy strategies might become critical.”  

By 1978 Exxon’s senior scientists were telling top management that climate change was real, caused by man, and would raise global temperatures by 2-3C this century, which was pretty much spot-on.  

By the end of that 10-year window, however, company executives had started ignoring science, cancelling research projects and investing in “spin” via the GCC. They poured tens of millions of dollars into advocacy groups and public relations campaigns designed to cast doubt on the scientific realities of climate change.

Below I describe how AGW was recognised as a problem since the 1860s, over a hundred years earlier. But first here is a list of 30 articles on myths created by the AGW denialism industry:  
https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn11462-climate-change-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/  

---
AGW was first identified as a problem by Stephen Tyndall in Scotland in the 1860s.  (It has recently come to light a US woman had discovered it a few years earlier but the US was not much regarded in science at the time and her paper did not attract further attention).  

In 1895 the size of the problem was quantified, a reasonably accurate measure of the greenhouse forcing effect of CO2 was published by Svennius Ahrenius the Nobel prize winning Swedish chemist.     CO2 is transparent to light and infrared energy from the sun, but blocks the much longer wavelength energy radiated by the Earth.  Which warms us.  There has never been any debate about that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Global warming became public knowledge following that work, if it had not been before.    E.g. in 1908 a small rural town newspaper in New Zealand published a short general interest article stating that at the current rate of fossil fuel burning the world may have a serious problem within 200 years.  Fossil fuel burning at that time was relatively small.  

The Earth has very intermittently periodic ice ages due to orbital effects, mostly orbital tilt.  Orbital changes periodically give the climate a push toward cooling or warming, and if other factors are in favour an ice age results or ends.  In the 1970s the history of temperature changes was being measured and theories generated to explain the 100k cycle in ice ages.  One model predicting a long term cooling effect which could lead to an ice age got a lot of attention.   

Exxon was a founding member of the GCC, the Global Climate Coalition.  This  disinformation operation eventually was revealed to be so disingenuous that it was abandoned by its oil company members, with Exxon Mobil being last to leave."
rape,fqklwmp,t3_gj7095,1589430252.0,"It is extremely common for survivors of any kind of tragedy, whether malicious or 100% random accident, to be tormented by thoughts of what they could have done to avoid it.  We are wired to do this to reduce our risks in future.  

It is also very common for victims to be tormented by inappropriate guilt.  Survivor guilt can be severe in people who survive a train crash, missed the flight that crashed etc, despite having obviously zero culpability.   It is much worse in situations where the victim interacted with the abuser, which opens up a field of actions to which blame can be attached.  

People who have been severely mistreated often internalise the abuser's attitude, they may be left with a chronic feeling of worthlessness years or decades afterwards.   

Free-floating guilt or worthlessness are particularly hard to tolerate so we seek to attach them to something, no matter how tenuous the connection might be.  In desperation some people actively create a real cause for feeling guilty or worthless.  This can bring relief because the ""source"" of pain is known and was or is still under your control, reducing anxiety that such pain will be inflicted from outside again. 

Depending where you live, there is probably help available for you locally.  It will also depend on your age, free youth services usually stop at some age between 16 and 18.  Adult services may have a reduced range of services available to people under 18.   Some sexual abuse services are restricted to biological females or to people who identify as girls and women.  Others only advertise as for women but can be helpful to men too, especially at your age.     

Many countries have mandatory reporting of sex crimes against minors, in which case they will be forced to report your story to police and normally your parents if you are under 18.  You can dance around that sometimes by stating only symptoms which could be from non-notifiable causes, or by lying about the cause.  That could get you treatment for anxiety and depression.  

Your school counselor is definitely under very strict mandatory reporting.  Be aware a school has quite a list of asses which must be covered before your wellbeing can be considered, so ask about their rules before seeking help.  They won't try to catch you out, they will explain the rules because they don't want to get tangled up in problems which might create a liability for them.  

If you are in the USA you can phone RAINN on the 0800 number and they will have a list of resources in your local area.  Phone support people vary in helpfulness and in how good a fit they are for you, so don't be discouraged if the first few are not what you need.  

You may not want to report this to police now but your mind could well change in future years, possibly several years in the future.  Consider writing out a statement with all the details you know and emailing it to yourself.  You could put it in a password protected document or zip file for privacy.  The email creates a permanent timestamped legal record.  
 The big thing is to lock yourself in to a mass of detail as soon as possible, because that is the opposite of what fakers do.   They try to keep their options open."

Try removing your Speedboost thumbdrive in case that isn't working properly.  You might need to shut down to do that.  Deleting everything on it and recreating the  speedboost partition might help too.   

It is far better to just increase your RAM than use  Speedboost if possible. 

Check  you have the latest BIOS because you might need it to recognise bigger or  more recent RAM.   

Some machines go faster if two identical SODIMMs are used, if they can do interleaving it allows significantly faster reads and writes.  Others can't do that but more memory is always better.  If Windows needs to use hard disk as pretend memory it is about a hundred times slower.   



Modules don't actually need to be identical to do interleaving, just the same size and at both at least the speed required, and occasionally some other detail that is hard to determine.  You will usually be OK adding one module of some other brand of the same size with the same or faster speed, but if buying two you should look for a pair.  

Hard drives are slower as the head gets closer to the centre.  2/3 full will not be as quick, and it goes downhill faster the more you add.   I use an external 1GB USB HDD to keep my HDD at least half empty.  

After cleaning / moving unused stuff off your HDD and deleting your caches do a few defrags in a row then delete your Windows swap file.  Reboot, then recreate it with a fixed size so it is all in one place not scattered all over the disk.  Check how much virtual memory you use in heavy use and add 50% perhaps."

Germans understand the processes by which fascists came to power in Italy, Spain, Germany and other countries on their doorstep.  They have also lived with the examples of various soviet satellites and authoritarian communist states in eastern Europe.  

That is why Germans tend to think the US is dangerously naive in following its simplistic notion of free speech, and in failing to teach students how populist leaders, fascism and authoritarian states of the left and right develop.

Straight razors and scissors go back a long way.   The safety razor (which holds a disposable blade in a holder to avoid deep cuts) came on the market around 1915.  To promote sales there was a tie in with dress styles which exposed the armpits, which could then be shaved smooth.   

Until the mid 1980s women in porn did not shave pubes, except as a freakshow.  In 1986 the movie Who Shaved Trinity Loren appeared, in which a woman woke up shaved and had to work out what happened so she could explain it to husband when he got back from his trip.  ""I wanted to"" was not a plausible explanation.  

For a few possible reasons, by 1990 all women in porn were shaved underneath at least.  It was that quick.   

It took 5 - 10 years for shaving to migrate to high school girls depending on location, 1995 - 2000 or later.    When it did it was sudden,  a doc in my town noted a sharp age difference was still visible i her patience ten years later.   

The preference is purely fashion.   Before the 90s razor and scissor technology was fine and women shaved legs and pits.  But they never considered modifying their pubes unless to catch some strays trying to escape from a bikini."

In general it is well established that men have a higher tolerance of risk, and attraction to risk, and willingness to break rules.   Car insurance payouts bear that out, even after adjusting for men's higher miles and longer trips.   So do arrest, conviction statistics.   

I did a quick search anyway, this is from the first document I opened:

Leaf and Preusser (1999) noted that male pedestrians are over-represented in injuries: among 21,751 injury cases studied, 70.2 % involved males.  [Other factors are known to be involved but the studies below suggest safety compliance is a likely factor]

In particular, sex differences were observed in injury risk behaviors (Byrnes et al., 1999).  
Female pedestrians have been shown to be more careful than males when crossing at intersections (Bergeron et al., 1998; Thouez et al., 2001).  

Dangerous behaviors and involvement in accidents among adult drivers were shown to be due
to rule-breaking more often in males than in females (Harré et al., 1996; Simon and Corbett,
1996; Yagil, 1998)  

Male pedestrians violate rules more often than females (Latrémouille et al., 2004; Moyano Diaz, 2002;
Rosenbloom, 2009; Rosenbloom et al., 2004; Yagil, 2000).   

Observations in the City of Montréal have shown 66% of women and 56.6% of men complied with road signs and
markings (Bergeron et al., 1998).   

Male pedestrians cross on red pedestrian lights more often than women (Moyano Diaz, 2002; Rosenbloom,
2009; Rosenbloom et al., 2004; Yagil, 2000).

Which doesn't help much if the mechanisms of abuse are themselves sexually attractive to you, but many people are not like that."
offmychest,fpfxop1,t1_fpecbv4,1588587424.0,"Exactly.  ""Why didn't you just leave"" is a statement of not having a clue about how abuse works.   Abusive behavior doesn't just get turned on like a tap one day. An infrastructure has to be created first before abuse becomes possible.  They don't hit you during the stage when you can ""just leave""."

Mayo Clinic is a private business that has a lot of money to lose from the flood of Republicans who could end up swearing they would never go there again.   

Then there is the frequently notified threat to abuse the power of the presidency to punish enemies, with copious examples.  

And the clear classification of expressing disagreement or insufficient agreement as being an enemy."
MensLib,fpex1r1,t1_fpad32d,1588556803.0,"Thinking toxicity is all encompassing does happen but is usually trivial to correct.   

A subtler and very common misconception is to think there is a subset of masculine traits which are inherently toxic.  I am not aware of any such trait that is toxic in all circumstances.  Toxicity only arises from expression of a trait in a situation where it is not appropriate."
