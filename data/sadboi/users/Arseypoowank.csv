I try to limit the amount of doing social things with my dad that involves more people than me as much as possible, i.e introducing girlfriends/friends because every time he opens his fucking mouth is fraught with panic that he’s going to say something either wildly offensive or embarrassing. Being as he has what I now believe is undiagnosed bipolar (which has only got worse and worse as he’s aged) you never know what version of him you’re going to get on any given day, so he’s either charming and sweet, furiously dogmatic, or just obnoxious, if he has a drink in his hand, usually the latter. He was always like that throughout my life but it was only when I moved out of the family home in my early twenties and spent a lot of time away from them that I realised how destructive his behaviour was and how much of an effect it had  on me and how wrong my viewpoints on a lot of things were and why I wasn’t the exactly the most popular kid/had a hard time making friends growing up, because I was essentially a young version of him. I love him so so dearly and as a father he always provided and cared for us but at 34, I just cannot stand to be around him for any protracted period of time without waves of just intense irritation and some residual resentment  washing over me. Probably makes me a terrible person but there you go."
