I know it's, too much or whatever I think it's awkward how much I'm telling you. Also I'm a boy, I'd be dead long time if I was a girl. Also bullying had happened too, I was hopeless since I didn't have anything to defend/ nothing to fight for if that makes sense. It's a lot; those days.

I think it was me being really ashamed of stinking  day after day. I use to forgot to put deodorant in my bag in 9th grade/ not wash my shoes too and socks and like the socks would be extremely dirty. Everyone viewed me as impoverished, though my parents had good jobs. I didn't wash my shoes and socks. Also on the first day of 10th grade I hair yelled in class for no reason at all. I still wonder why. It was incredible nonsensical behavior or aka Just bullshit on my part. Oh... so what caused this was just a sharp not caring at all, since I had strong reputation of mental illness that I fronted in since 9th grade. Also I did that to distance myself from everyone since being aligned with me was embarrassing"

and in 10th grade to make up for my 9th grade um... oh right I was already pretending to eh retarded to in 9th grade and everyone already believed I was because mostly body odour

But yeah , it's very sad. So in 10th grade, I was seething of shame from 9th grade and... I guess it happened again and then I shit myself I don't know why I didn't wash myself and then everything was went terribly wrong, it's weird how that happened more times throughout the year. I literally just forgot the first time, the others  I don't know I forgot too wash or really I didn't even care about myself at all I was already the stinky kid. Then I just gave an exscuse and mimicked autism/ ADHD. Yes. This was all real. It all started from and hygiene though as a freshman. I failed all my classes I guess because I was in honors classes so I'd be like... not autistic/mentally challenged if I had passed them and I was hopelessly behind anyways due to the shame from hygiene. Everyone knew and every second was agony. Also, no matter how many times you wash black jeans they'll still smell because of the dyes(google it), I only wore black jeans. Anyways I never recovered after all that happened in the first month of school. I simply didn't."
