ptsd,f80ax75,t3_dy3w0c,1574124603.0,"Maybe its because it wasn't defined in the military as ptsd until fairly recently. It was called, ""Battle-Fatigue"". Another theory could be that it is just some stuff in the search algorithm on sites which literally decides what to pop up based on certain stuff. I don't know what that stuff is. Advertising could be a big part of it i don't know.  I think it might be more random than we think tho."

BipolarReddit,f6rqvm8,t3_dsfl2n,1573116308.0,"My experience: no thanks. 

he puff units for 51 50s are ok I guess but everyone is super severe mostly so that makes it mostly not chill for like the entire time. The nursing staff is better in every way mostly though. 

The long term places are like wow dude really you gotta be kidding me of those places are even remotely ok.  Only the actual RNs are remotely giving a damn. 

Don't feel bad, this is my experience. I thought they were going to be acceptable on some cool level before going into the hospitals, so it's probably my bad for being seriously let down in almost every way when I had to be in the places. 

We could smoke at the long term place which was , uh.. acceptable."

Yeah well I went off and on, more on now but seriously waiting until after it gets a little dark out first. 

The vodka I got tonight was svedka one pint. It took about four hours to drink... Yeah rapid but gotta kill that terrible malt liquor hangover!! 

I might stick to the smaller bottle per night if I do keep drinking this instead of MULTIPLE cans of rando beer..whatever I feel might do the job. Seems safer.

Stay strong and don't fall for the curve balls..

My sister even told me that my Ndad was dying. When he came to invade my privacy ( they may come knock on the door, yes..don't answer) he did not at all look like he was dying. No chance. Plus If he is then whatever. 

They will treat you like dirt until you're old. 

So yeah, invasion of privacy about 30 percent, others you still talk to pushing boundary at about 20 percent, and self doubt at about 50 percent (these numbers are just ""at first"") ...has been my experience.

NarcissisticAbuse,f3wzrmf,t3_dilwge,1571227946.0,"I was in a similar situation, but sort of as the guy.

In my twenties I was anxious, paranoid, and wounded. I would not say I was Narc, just...wounded and anxious and paranoid .

I lived with dysfunctional fam. It was awful for my GF, who came to live with me. 

I swear I loved so much, but I was in a dark spot and probably some bad traits like Narcs , but defo not one, I cared too much about my sick mom and this girl...that was about it for awhile.

Well now I'm married, and I still have feelings but as you said, nothing I would act on. I'm even over sending emails ECT. Which was a thing for quite awhile a couple years ago. 

I wish her well and would talk, but it's risky. I feel like when we talked before the feelings were there even in email.. I mean some. It was hard not to get excited to email ECT. 

We were both so sensitive, and touchy. I was the one though..the darker half so to speak. 

Hope she's well, and you keep your head up. Appreciate the man you are with now, some dysfunctional human relations are better from afar. Be glad you had known him, but be strong against these feelings. Over time the one you are with will help you see the amazing things that are within them. 

Stick those feelings further on the back burner. 

You seem stable, don't descend into chaos! Good luck"
