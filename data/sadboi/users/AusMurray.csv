JamesBond,flv9pa6,t1_flv8lbb,1585519290.0,Yes I’m actually surprised so many people are defending it. It usually gets trashed by most fans. If I hadn’t watched it this week and had it still fresh on my mind I probably would agree that it’s not that good. Another guy that posted a ranking yesterday put From Russia With Love last so I wouldn’t feel too bad lol.
JamesBond,flv7kxf,t3_frau53,1585518047.0,I actually watched Never Say Never Again the other day when it was on TV and found it rather enjoyable. It’s one of I’ve always forgotten about and rarely watched but it’s enjoyable enough just not as good as Connery’s 60s Bond films.

JamesBond,flt2s8q,t3_fo6ilk,1585457532.0,This one really grows on you. It’s definitely not as good as Casino Royale but it’s an interesting revenge film like Licence To Kill was and I like its gritty realistic tone and Camille was a great Bond girl I thought. 7/10.
JamesBond,flt2j9c,t3_fqzf0d,1585457324.0,Well I’m shocked to see From Russia With Love last and I don’t think I ever have before but It’s definitely nice to see some appreciation for Thunderball and The Living Daylights. All three films are amongst my top five.
askgaybros,flt23o3,t3_fqu35n,1585456967.0,Yes as long as they have a nice personality. There could be a variety of reasons they don’t have friends so wouldn’t judge them right away.
