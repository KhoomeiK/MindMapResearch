suggestmeabook,fr5f0uj,t1_fr4qktz,1589907487.0,"I read it as a 29 year old woman and liked it so idk. I think the author does a nice job with Auri and some other female characters, and I was really invested in a lot of the other elements so I just viewed Kvothe as a little bit of an ass, but he's the narrator of it all so I read it as ""Kvothe totally bangs, says Kvothe"" and it didn't kill the story. Like, I loved the whole lady lackless, Cinder, wtf is going on Story line; the way the people he was training with communicate both with language and hand gestures; the whole magical school system (and student loans, lol) thing; Bast; the way magic works; etc. There was enough other stuff that I didn't really get caught up in that part.

Also, I looooved The Slow Regard of Silent Things, also by Rothfuss, it's a novella about Auri and it was really beautiful. I think Rothfuss is a good writer, and I could be wrong, but the vibe I always got was that since the setup is that Kvothe is telling all this to a scribe, it's going to be embellished. It's exactly the kind of thing a kinda full of himself dude would make up in his memoir. So maybe less ""men writing women"" and more ""men writing men""?"

harrypotter,fqy152j,t1_fqxqkif,1589740913.0,"Idk, I thought the fact that he killed Dumbledore and in doing so let everybody think he was a monster and almost died without anybody know the truth must have been a struggle. Especially bc I think there was a scene between him and Dumbledore about this and about Snape's resistance to the entire Harry as a sacrifice plan. We don't get to see very much bc we see through Harry's eyes and he didn't see much. That's part of the complexity of the character and of JK's writing I think. Idk if you're read Golden Compass, but Snape reminds me a bit of Mrs. Coulter in that totally unresolved good person bad person vibe."
harrypotter,fqxfc0k,t1_fqx4024,1589731396.0,"I keep seeing this in the comments, but ""good person"" is such a complex concept and it's getting treated so simplistically here, as if deeming someone good or bad is easy. I think the POINT of Snape's character is to get at this idea of thr complexity and ambiguity of people. In real life people are nuanced. There are people who are amazing, caring parents who are also ruthless jerks in their careers in ways that get people killed. Snape was petty and emotionally stunted and he ruined the relationships he had. He grew up with childhood abuse at home, really humiliating bullying at school, and turned into a bitter, spiteful man who was cruel to kids. He also realized he was in the wrong and spent decades forcing himself to override these aspects of himself to protect Harry, to help Dumbledore, etc.

I think the whole point of Snape is to challenge our idea of what a good person can look like. His negative aspects were big ones, but his positive actions were huge. His character is one designed to make us question the idea of redemption. Like, is there something we can do that is big enough to override our petty, base selves, or is it that even if you sacrifice your life, literally and figuratively, that you are still ""bad""? 

I feel like his character almost gets at the debate between utilitarianism and deontologism."

HumansBeingBros,fqql55u,t1_fqpt0ou,1589567430.0,"I agree with a lot of your points, but I think the positive/negative aspect is still important. I work in mental health and see first hand there, and in my personal life with friends, how much over-focusing on the negative aspects and/or discounting the positive can demotivate people and depress them, and that's what I get concerned with.  I absolutely saw the title of this post and thought, ""oh man, this is some r/aboringdystopia shit"" but I've started noticing recently how some people in my life are so bummed about all the negative stuff in the world that they've started taking this hopeless attitude. Like if I say, ""oh look the FBI is investigating those awful insider trading senators!"" they'll say, ""it doesn't matter because blah blah blah"" 

It's not about being positive or negative exclusively, but about being realistic. We need to be able to hold space for ambivalence; and recognize both positive and negative aspects in these cases, because ambivalence leads to disequalibrium which leads to action. Like, in this case ambivalence might make us say, ""that's a good kid, it's wrong that this situation happened, let's fix it"" while either complete optimism and ignoring the negative might make us say, ""how nice! The world is fine!"" and commenting only on the negative can lead us to the place of ""God, the world is fucked, there are so many huge problems we'll never fix it.""

I think the problem is that people hate ambivalence. It's uncomfortable specifically because it makes us feel the need to do something, and that is hard. We don't like books or movies with ambiguous characters who are a little good and a little bad and the ending is sorta neutral. We don't like it in news either so news sources either spin things as positive and heartwarming OR terrifying and miserable. I don't think most of us have been exposed to ambivalent stories and I think it causes problems, both globally and just in little everyday ways like in our relationships."

Hopefully, adults who see things like this and are in a position to actually do something about it (ie live in South Africa, have the privileges required to make change, etc) will be inspired by this kid and try to make it so this doesn't keep happening.

There are real, structural differences at play and real neurological connections that either are or are not there (ie neurons that fire together wire together). You might be able to develop some skills in some of these abilities ie create connections/pathways, but some of it is really just how you're wired. Especially the kind of skills that  savants have where they did not intentionally seek to develop these skills. Injuries like you're talking about don't magically unlock a power we all have sitting around, they structurally change our brain so it can do something it couldn't do before.

Basically, neurodiversity is real and important and awesome! All of us have different brains from a combo of genetics, environment, experience and learning. Some of us have....different-er brains that come with perks and issues specifically because they're different. Just like someone who is autistic or has ADHD can't just change their brain, a neurotypical person can't really force their brain to go the other way on just a single feature here.

That feeling right there is usually a good sign that something is going on and that you should trust yourself a bit more. I don't know if it's a comforting thought, but a lot of times with stuff like this the person's behavior functions as a way to get some need met that they don't know how to meet in another way and it's not totally in their conscious awareness. It doesn't excuse the behavior, but sometimes thinking about it this way (e.g. How sad to feel like you have to convince yourself and others that you're sick in order to get attention) can make it less infuriating to be around, and more just kind of sad.

I don't want to be too hard on celebrities here in a sense though, because I think all industries have this to a lesser degree. Like, if you grow up in a family of doctors or musicians, you're more likely to follow that path too. You know the social culture, you grew up with more information and knowledge about the subject, parents might have taught you things, and are more likely to have similar personality traits or physical skills to your parents that helped them succeed in that field (like being hot for celebrities, lol).

Social media influencing though is kind of a different ballgame. Acting or singing, even in a mediocre way, does take some degree of skill and work at the end of the day. The stuff OP is talking about generally does not."

There was so much about them that resonated with me as a teenager, they were rebellious and intense and the things that happened to them were unfair. In my 20s that changed a little, there was more nuance, I felt sad for them, what a tragedy! I'm 32 now, and while I still love those story lines, and still see the tragedy, I also see how extremely emotionally stunted they all were. They're all frozen. Sirius with old rage, Snape pining over Lily and resenting a child, Peter well no comment needed, and Lupin! Lupin who seems on the surface so mature and grown up, always the most reasonable, but who disappeared on his pregnant partner because he couldn't deal with feelings.

menwritingwomen,fpu6z5q,t1_fpu24xg,1588906024.0,"I think people are misunderstanding your comment. Rhetorical context matters A LOT. Gonna give some examples to illustrate the concept that I think you're trying to get at. 
In this example, ""teenage woman/women"" is used to refer to teenage minors:

A) ""Five teenage women are petitioning the governor"" 
vs

B) ""Five teenage girls are petitioning the governor""
vs

C) ""Five children are petitioning the governor"" 
vs

D) ""The 40 year old man had sex with a teenage woman""

The first three have the same rhetorical context. ""Teenage women"" is language used to lend credibility and respect to the subjects because it conveys maturity. ""Teenage girls"" by contrast, makes the reader take this much less seriously. ""Children"" is even more invalidating and unempowering.

D is a totally different rhetorical context. Here using ""teenage woman"" to convey maturity, but it's not the same as A. Here it's exploiting word choice to hide facts and to bias the reader into seeing ""sex between consenting adults"" instead of ""raping a minor"".

In the first context we are hiding their age in order to give the girls more power. In the second context we're hiding the girl's age in order to hide a sex crime. Obviously pretty different."

Varicella/Chickenpox can result in shingles years later. Other herpes simplex viruses can cause symptoms years later as well. There is absolutely no guarantee that if you get COVID and recover that you won't have serious consequences years later after you recover.

We already know that COVID has neurological involvement some of the time via loss of smell and taste, so personally I'm not messing around here. If this was a virus we knew a lot about and knew there wouldn't be any very serious associated illnesses, I could see waiting on getting the vaccine, but at the end of the day, the vaccine is almost definitely the safest option, not just in the short term, but the long term, too.

There once was a house where there lived a woman and her cat. Early one morning, while woman slept, the cat crawled into her bed and tapped his paws on her face. The woman decided to give some food to the poor cat, he must be very hungry to behave so badly. The next night before bed, the woman gave the cat extra food, for fear he would wake her up again. He seemed satisfied and she went to sleep, sure they would both sleep through the night. However, in the early morning hours, again the cat crawled into her bed and tapped her in the face. ""You had plenty of food!"" said the woman, ""Let me sleep now."" The cat meowed and meowed and the woman, exhausted, gave in and gave the cat some food, ""Just a little bit, now let me have some peace!"" He let her sleep for the rest of the morning, but again the next day he woke her up. Having had enough, lightly sleep deprived from days of this routine, the woman said, ""That's it! I know you're not hungry, you're just being a pest!"" and she locked the cat in the bathroom. The cat, used to getting early morning food, cried, getting louder with every meow of protest. It was very hard for the woman to resist giving him food. Even though she was in bed and the bathroom down the hall, the cat's cries carried to her. She put her pillow over her ear. She could not sleep, but she did not let the cat out. The next morning, the cat tried again to get food from the woman while she slept. Again he went into the bathroom, but he did not cry so much or for so long, and the woman slept. After a few days, the cat decided to get his attention in other, less annoying ways, and if he misbehaved, the woman knew how to handle it.

FragileWhiteRedditor,fnzepdn,t1_fnyf7rf,1587392594.0,"This is something I've been a little confused about but haven't given too much thought before now. I think it absolutely makes sense what you're saying about do we need the description and the difference in the scenarios you described, which is something I hadn't considered before. The times I've found it a little confusing are when I get updates from school or citizen about a violent crime where they give some physical details but not race, build, or hair color. Like, there was one maybe two months ago where some dude broke into a woman's apartment and raped her and then escaped out the window, and the alert was like, ""man wearing a blue sweatshirt and jeans."" I can see how putting race here might cause racist people to see a black man in these (super common) clothes as a perpetrator but maybe not a white guy, but I also think without race those same people are just going to fill in the blank with their racist assumptions, so why give a clothing description at all unless the clothes were very unique (""man in pink sequined leotard""), you know? It seems like either a very detailed description, e.g. ""6 foot tall white man with short brown hair and a medium build"" or even no description at all, ""man"" would be better? Bc like you're saying, it might not be particularly relevant for the general public to be on the lookout to report a suspect, and a vague description isn't likely to help much. It gets to the question of what's the goal of the alert? Is it to try to get citizens to keep their eyes open for a suspect to report them? To keep others safe, and if so, who (e.g. citizens from false accusations and arrest, general public, etc.)? Or is the goal just to report the news so people take safety measures like locking their windows? Open to thoughts on this, I think it's really interesting from a police/journalism/public safety ethics perspective. How do you minimize the chance of harm in reporting? Should we limit physical descriptions to only the active shooter type situations?"
ADHD,fnw7m2r,t1_fnvwvct,1587313038.0,"This! Also, re: the other comment, specifically the part about people not having full symptom relief even with meds and therapy - sometimes that's true, but how we think and feel about symptoms is also very important. There's a significant difference from noticing a symptom, accepting it, and moving on with your day than noticing it, being extremely upset by it and going off on a chain of negative thoughts. E.g. ""yeah I had that weird intrusive thought and then gave in and checked the stove 4 times. I've had a rough week and it's expected my symptoms might pop up. Disappointing but not the end of the world."" feels VERY different than, ""I can't believe I thought that. What's wrong with me? And then I checked the stove four times! Who does that?! I will never have a normal life. Why can't I just get my shit together?!""

Not trying to imply meaning to the original comment, just wanted to put it out there that even if we don't achieve 100% symptom reduction does not mean we can't feel a ton better with therapy."

I'm agnostic and think that if a God exists, they are essentially unknowable, but even without a God, I think humans make meaning from things (even profoundly negative experiences), and that's probably more important than why bad things happen."

To me the solution here isn't that you guys should get some money back in exchange for a crappy education, but that you get a decent education. It is entirely possible to deliver a high quality education online that is interactive and thought provoking, far above what you'd get from cheap/free online courses. There are reputable online programs that give people very good educations, some which are better than many in person programs. It's really dependent on how the class is run. If you aren't getting a good education anymore, your professor isn't involved, you don't have discussion board conversations with peers, etc. start making suggestions and demanding the education you deserve. (that said, I do think some reimbursement is warranted because of facilities not used, reduced overhead from utility bills, etc. I just don't want people accepting a shit education in exchange for partial reimbursement)

Edit: lol @ down votes for saying that I support some refunds for services not used but also think universities are obligated to also provide a decent education online.

StudentLoans,fndoysz,t1_fnd87ej,1586874705.0,"I was with you until your last paragraph where you seem to imply that fake students are somehow behind this (??) or students who don't care.  

I'm in grad school and feel somewhat torn about some of the arguments made by students asking for refunds. Proration makes sense. Reimbursement for things like the gym, canceled graduation ceremonies, room and board, meal plans, etc. should absolutely be refunded.

The quality of the education thing is harder to defend, imo. Online classes at my school are not normally any cheaper than in person classes (sadly). Students should have the option of taking an incomplete for this semester and retaking the class in person if they feel the quality of education is much worse. Because here's the thing - if the quality is that bad, then the class shouldn't even count toward your degree. This is what makes me uncomfortable. I get where the argument is coming from but it ends up degrading an education that is still good, at least in my experience. I don't like the message sent that makes it seem like our degrees are bullshit now. If the quality is shit at your school right now, then demand a better education, don't say, ""this is crap and I'm learning nothing, but I'm ok with that if it's cheaper"". It's either good enough or not. If it's not, get the money back and retake the class. No class, in person or not, will be as good right now because we are all stressed out. That's ok. If the class is so much worse you feel you're not getting the education you paid for though, then the money is secondary.

Again though, before people jump on me, I fully support reimbursement! I just don't like this one specific argument. The rest I'm down with though. Feel free to cmv though, I'm open!"
ADHD,fndmmmz,t1_fndcx7d,1586873353.0,"I agree with you, but I think the issue is that a lot of the posts don't really specify the severity/distress component. Like, the loud noises thing. Everyone is saying, ""no, disliking loud noises is associated with adhd."" but I'm not seeing people talk about what that means. Not liking loud noises is a human thing. Being so disturbed by loud noises that it causes significant distress or a very exaggerated startle response is something else. I think we need to pay more attention to the language we use because otherwise we get cases like this where NT people are like, ""oh yah me too"" which can invalidate the real experience of atypical folks by either making NT people think a symptom is fake, or by making them think ""I'm soooo adhd lol"""
ADHD,fndm0yq,t1_fnd0ja2,1586872991.0,"Agree. I don't feel like there's a problem with people getting comfort from hearing that other people do a thing, too, but the way that is then taken to mean  ""therefore it must be an adhd thing"" isnt as helpful, imo. We like to complain when NT think they have ADHD because they lost their keys once, but these conversations where we call common behaviors ADHD sort of contribute to the problem? 

I wish the frequency/distress dimension was included more in these conversations. Like, everyone is commenting about the loud noises thing OP mentioned actually being an ADHD thing. But here's the thing: nobody like surprise loud noises. It causes a startle response in most humans AND animals. There's a difference though between ""not enjoying loud noises"" and ""being caused significant distress and dysfunction when exposed to a sudden loud noise"" and I feel like this distinction is often left out in the weird validation echo chamber that pops up.

It's not just this sub though. Over at r/bisexual they're convinced not sitting properly in chairs and enjoying lemon bars are bisexual things. 🤷‍♀️"

bisexual,fn20qaz,t1_fn1ljer,1586574826.0,"I said a whole bunch of times that he's not wrong to want it though. You quote part of what I said but left out the part after where I said the reason to explore his feelings is bc it would help him feel better, regardless of what he decided to do.

He is asking her to compromise but compromise means both parties do something. That doesn't mean he needs to give her the ok to have sex with someone else, but it does mean that if he's asking her to give up thaf experience, he should spend some time really trying to understand her. And I'm not saying he should try to understand her as some manipulative way to convince him to let her do this. He still is 100% entitled to stay firm in saying it's a deal breaker. I just mean that if they stay together and she decides to not explore her sexuality then the relationship will be stronger and less likely to lead to any resentment if they do it this way .

He specifically said he doesn't want the relationship to end. Drawing a firm line while refusing to attempt to really reflect or convey understanding to her is only likely to increase the chance they do break up.

Empathy and challenging ourselves to understand our partner doesn't hurt relationships. And it doesn't mean we have to stay with them. I can understand and empathize with someone who is abusive or has a serious drug addiction and also decide not to stay with them even if I love them, you know?"
bisexual,fn0gcg8,t3_fyf4rs,1586541427.0,"Differing opinion here. It doesn't actually sound like she's asking for an open relationship, just a single experience. You absolutely have every right to a monogamous relationship, but I want to be clear that the thing you're asking of her is this: ""You have to pick between keeping someone you love and having an experience that is important to your identity because I am afraid I will react in a way that will ruin the relationship.""

That probably seems unfair, but let me explain what I mean:

You're saying multiple times that you don't want her to have this experience because you ""believe it will destroy \[your\] relationship."" But you're also saying you know she loves you. You said you are afraid you will be jealous and wouldn't be able to look at her the same way again. What I **didn't** read was, ""I'm afraid she'll want to be with women and will leave me.""

So, while you do have the right to your feelings, it seems like what's going on is that the situation is bringing up some of your insecurities and you're afraid that **your feelings** will destroy the relationship, but instead of saying that, you're making it seem like it's actually her desire to have sex with a woman one time in her entire life that is going to destroy the relationship. I think it's important to recognize that what you're doing here is asking her to take responsibility for your feelings rather than taking responsibility for your own feelings. This sucks for both of you, but actually more for you because when we think someone else is responsible for our feelings we feel really powerless. The only option seems like they need to do something different and we can't see that actually we have a lot of control over our own feelings and reactions.

So, let's try reframing this in terms of **you** and not her. Here are your options:

1. You could break up with her. The reason you don't want her to sleep with another woman is because you're afraid the relationship will end, so this doesn't seem like the ideal option.
2. You could be firm that it's a deal breaker for her to sleep with a woman even once without doing any reflection. As a warning, what she will hear is this: ""If you really love me, you would be willing to sacrifice this exploration of your identity."" Anything that starts with ""if you really love me"" is pretty much bound to end poorly.

Potential outcomes: a)  She breaks up with you b) She goes for years never having had an experience that is actually pretty important to her identity, and it always makes her feel sad and possibly resentful. c) She cheats on you because she doesn't want to choose d) Somehow she just forgets about all of this and is magically fully content to never experience this. e) Regardless of outcome, I guarantee this will not be the approach that brings you closer or makes your relationship stronger. She won't feel like you understand her and she'll probably feel isolated in your relationship.

2) Realize the situation isn't black and white and that you're going to do some hard work that scares you. You decide to explore your own feelings, challenge your beliefs, learn more about bisexuality and queer identity development (I'm assuming you don't know much because you're asking ""Is this normal for someone in her position to want), and talk more with her about why she is asking for this, what it would look like if it happened, what the rules would be, etc. before making a decision about what would be best for you, her, and your relationship.

Potential outcomes: Either way, both of you will feel better about whatever you decide is best. She will feel like you're actually listening and being supportive, and hey that might actually be enough. You might break up, you might stay together, etc. but in this situation you have a lot of control. There is a lot of room to negotiate, talk, and you can decide where your boundaries are and ask for what you want at any point. It doesn't have to be a ""yes, here's a free pass"" or ""We're breaking up"" situation.

3) You agree to letting her explore her sexuality without doing any work on yourself. Potential outcome: You react poorly, as predicted, and the relationship falls apart.

If it's any comfort to you, I have been in the situation where I was in an opposite-sex relationship before I had been with a woman (I'm a woman). I felt so sad thinking I might live my whole life never having had that experience. It had nothing to do with my partner whatsoever and it's really hard to explain how I felt, but I guess sort of like a homesickness? I just knew it would be such a huge regret. We broke up, for totally unrelated reasons, and I did end up having sex with women. I've been in an opposite-sex relationship now for 6 years and am totally happy to go the rest of my life without ever having a sexual experience with anyone else, male or female. If I had never slept with another woman, I wouldn't be saying that. So if you have some fear that she'll sleep with a woman and suddenly it will open this lesbian floodgate where she won't be satisfied with you, I'm like 99% positive you have nothing to worry about."

Re: the claim about the lower academic quality, at least in my experience, it's not the online format that is creating a subpar academic environment, it's the anxiety and stress that is omnipresent right now. And really, the professors who are trying hardest to make sure the educational side is ""equal"" to what we had before are actually the ones doing it wrong. Many students who previously were managing the coursework fine are now struggling because they are stressed, have kids at home (granted more of an issue for grad students), got layed off or alternately had to start working to help family, are dealing with sick loved ones, etc. The appropriate thing to do IS to provide a different, less rigorous education.

* Have you been quarantining? When was the last time you were in a situation with a reasonable chance of contracting it?
* How would you get him and bring him home? Is there any risk involved here?
* Does he currently require medical care because of the tumors? Is there a chance he would need medical care that you couldn't provide?
* Has he had contact with the care worker who tested positive or anyone else who had close contact with that worker?
* What is the chance he already has been exposed?

Obviously, the best case scenario is that you can prevent him from contracting it entirely. But there are so many uncontrollable variables and so many uncertainties already, so the more important question right now might actually be this:

If he *did* contract COVID, would it be better for that to happen at the group home or under your care?

* What would happen to him if you got sick? Is there anyone who could come and take care of him?
* Could he go back to the group home if you did get sick or would they not let him back because of COVID risk? Many group facilities are under lock down.
* Do you have any other family members who are responsible for making decisions for him, medically or otherwise? e.g. if you got sick and couldn't be in this role, who would do that if he wasn't in a group home? (assuming the group home has some authority currently to make decisions in his best interest)
* Does the group home have any medical staff on site?
* Is there any concern about difficulty caring for him if he got sick at home but it wasn't particularly severe? (e.g. would it be easy to keep him relatively isolated in your apartment? could you give him medication easily? etc.)

menwritingwomen,fltbygu,t1_fls1z4f,1585466474.0,"I mean, I guess because I think telling women that they have inadequate personalities, are trying to appear superior, and are infantile still has like...no validity, and I'm kind of puzzled how you're seeing this excerpt that way. I think something might be a little lost if you don't read the title of the article before this, but I guess I wasn't able to fully anticipate that before I posted. Also this was the first part of the article I got to where I was like woah, did not expect that! so it stuck with me more than the other bits."

menwritingwomen,flron4q,t1_flri86l,1585424570.0,"The title of the article is ""Improve Your Husband Scientifically"" so I went with the word improve in the title of mine. Obviously, we can't force anyone to ""improve"", and trying to mold a partner into being some ideal that you're looking for is definitely not a good look, but if you read the whole article it legit talks about how women can cure their husbands of alcoholism by being lovable enough and dressing nice on dates. It's less about ""improvement"" and more about telling women that they're immature, inadequate people if they ask their husband to make important changes (like not committing crimes or being drunk all the time). It also says that husbands who don't magically change due to their wife being ""lovable"" are ""hopeless."" So it's not even that awesome to men either :p"
menwritingwomen,flro0ms,t1_flrm1iq,1585424192.0,"The reason your husband is still an alcoholic is obviously because you're not lovable enough!

I feel like somewhere in here is the (true) idea that we can't \*force\* another human to change, but instead of being like, ""You can't force someone to change, you can only ask that they do and then decide for yourself if you want to stay with them if they refuse to do so"" he just went to the most sexist unhelpful place possible. >.<"

Coronavirus,flowigo,t1_flow6iq,1585346922.0,"I think it's not that theyre using a test on the cat as a waste, but to see whether pets can get and/or transmit it to humans, which is pretty important to know. There is a type of Coronavirus that cats get that we already know about, so it isn't totally crazy to be asking this question."
brakebills,flmhn1z,t1_flj61t0,1585283908.0,"Reading this where you talked about Fen made me wonder if part of the problem is the lack of a main character now. It might have been ok if the show started this way, but it didn't, and now we have characters being used to complete the narrative of the show rather than completing a story line that was set for them from the beginning. 

Books and shows that have several PoV characters do work, but in these each character gets a lot of dedicated time, you see from their eyes and then in the end all of the character plots come together in a surprising way. An episode of Got, for example, didn't typically follow all of the characters working on the same plot every single episode. Instead one episode would predominantly be Arya, another Sansa, etc. They may have been working on the same goal, but each story line was written to see their particular character grow, they didn't grow in order to be able to solve a convenient problem. 

The episode of Magicians this season that focused heavily on Margot and Eliot in a time loop was strong because we got that development and dedicated time, and because Eliot has had a ton of character development throughout the show. A lot of the other episodes though, like this one, divide our attention in too many directions for such a short period of time. I bet it would work really well if it was done over time, but I feel like i never got time to be invested enough in Marina's relationship for me to be emotional when she and her gf got in a fight. Penny's mom stuff too. It could have been so much more powerful if it had been built up as a plot for longer than like 5 minutes."
brakebills,flmf61l,t1_fliwmzf,1585281948.0,"I really disliked the musical part of this episode. In the past the songs fit both the plot and the tone better. I just rewatched Under Pressure and it was really moving, Eliot and Margot waiting to go over the falls, Penny in the UW, everyone coming together, and the song was emotional. This time the first musical number came out of nowhere and didn't seem related to anything, Alice's was emotional and at least made a little sense with the empaths, but I Wanna Be Sedated didn't really make sense? It didn't just instantly sedate them through magic, it supposedly overwhelmed them with empathy via a pretty unemotional song? Unless I'm missing something. Honestly, it probably wouldn't have bothered me so much if it they didn't spend soooo much time on it and it wasn't the second to last episode ever where we still have a ton to wrap up. I kind of just want as much time on meaningful stuff as possible because I love the show :\"
Coronavirus,flm8zuc,t1_flm7o3q,1585277442.0,"Yeah, like I said I'm not disagreeing with your point about the Chinese government possibly lying. Just pointing out the graph thing, because when I first read the comment and looked at the graph I totally misread it for a moment and thought others might so the same thing initially."
Coronavirus,flm8oba,t1_flm6oyk,1585277223.0,"Yes and no. This dog tested ""weak positive"" and experts believe he ""caught"" it from his owner, however he never developed symptoms. The dog did die later, but it was also 17 years old, so it was very possibly unrelated. Also, there isn't any evidence yet that dogs can get *sick* from COVID-19 or pass it on to humans. https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-first-case-human-to-dog-transmission.html"
Coronavirus,flm6yh6,t1_flm5cvk,1585276032.0,"I dont necessarily disagree with you, but keep in mind this chart starts in March and shows the progression from the 1st case for Italy and US, but it's not showing the whole progression for China (I. E. The chart starts at 0 for US but starts at 3,000 for China) so it's not a great comparison tool."
Coronavirus,flm6glr,t1_flm50i0,1585275696.0,"Right? First, I'm 100% sure the powers that be have more important things to do right now than track down the name and personal info for somebody who said they felt well or unwell. Second, wtf would they do with this data that would be bad? Not feeling good? What are they going to do? Literally nothing. I mean hell, right now you can walk into a testing site and say this and be told to go home. Feeling good? Cool we don't have to be concerned. The responses here are really baffling."
Coronavirus,flintus,t1_flhww6b,1585186586.0,"I think a lot of people getting dogs and cats right now are not doing so because they're bored or careless, but because many are living in complete physical isolation in small apartments, are experiencing a lot of anxiety, etc. and they're looking for another living being to spend time with. That's a pretty powerful thing, and I'm remaining optimistic that most of these adoptions are going to last."
Coronavirus,flfx2kk,t1_flfwabz,1585121209.0,"I mean, every case is different. I don't think there's a blanket statement to make here. Generally, I'm ok with anyone who is in jail for a victimless crime (like technical parole violations or possession of drugs) being released and not finishing the term. I would hope that anyone released for other types of non-violent crimes (that do have victims) they would finish their sentence at a later date. The only reason I can think of against that is if there was some logistical problem with doing this. I don't really know what that would be, maybe there would be fear of overcrowding at a later date? Again though, what I'm arguing for is a case by case review, not a broad release of people."
