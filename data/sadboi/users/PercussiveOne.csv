I know this probably sounds like common sense. I just don’t want you to feel like you have to be serious all the time or have an attitude such as that. It’s okay to have fun with your section and joke around with them. You just have to know when it’s appropriate to do so. You don’t want to be so easy on them that they take advantage of you, and you don’t want to be so hard on them that they hate you. 

With the previous section leaders I’ve had, I respected them a lot because they knew when they needed to be tough on us, but also were kind and had a great sense of humor. They were great leaders, and didn’t boast about their leadership position. 

I know this advice may have been dumb, but I wanted to share it."

mentalhealth,fo215jq,t1_fo203zu,1587446643.0,"With college, I don’t know, it’s weird. My plan was to study music education to become a music teacher. I auditioned and got accepted into a school. When I first found out, I was so happy, it was the happiest I had been in a long time, so much so that when I found out, I cried.

See, when I first realized that teaching music was what I wanted to do, I was hesitant to tell anyone. To me, the idea of me becoming a teacher sounds ridiculous. How could someone like me be a teacher? I worry about every little thing as much as I try not to. I doubt myself every day. I always feel like an idiot. I feel pathetic. I can’t stop the thoughts that go through my head. I doubt I’d be a good teacher, even though I’ve had some people tell me otherwise. They’re probably just saying it to be nice.

Thing is, I think all these things, but I know that this is the career I would want. I know that if I don’t go after this, I’ll regret it. But why should I try and do this, knowing I’ll probably fail, when there are others out there who are more confident, more talented, better teachers, who deserve the job more than I do?

The people telling you that you are manipulating them? I wouldn’t listen to them. There is nothing wrong with reaching out for help when you need it.

There is definitely someone out there willing to listen. Trust me, never opening up again will hurt you much more. You aren’t manipulating anyone. You aren’t trying to make people feel bad. You just want someone to listen, and maybe help. You are so not in the wrong here. Don’t listen to those people. You just need to find someone you know and trust.

I brought up therapists, who want to help people (at least I would assume the majority do), and are professionals, and asked if he was basically saying that they are useless. Told me they are, so basically made me even more afraid to reach out, even though I disagreed with the guy. Ended it with telling me to “just stop giving a fuck”. Just blocked the guy and left.

percussion,fn5r7nt,t3_fzrbvn,1586673148.0,"You could. I’ve had it in pieces before where it says “to (insert instrument name here)”.I think it’s more common with mallet instruments though. Like going from marimba to xylo or something like that. It could be done with any instrument though. 

Honestly as long as you give them time it shouldn’t be an issue. It’s especially common in musicals. The percussionist will be playing many different instruments. I know you aren’t writing a musical, I just used that as an example. You should be fine. 

With timpani, I’d suggest putting the required pitches at the beginning of the piece just so the player can tune them to the correct pitch before hand. Obviously any changes after that would need to be done during the song, but a good enough timpanist shouldn’t have a problem with it. Sorry for the long response. 

TL;DR you should be good. This isn’t that uncommon.

Edit: just want to point out one more thing. Depending on how many percussionists you have, some switches will make more sense. For example mallet instrument to other mallet instrument, or timpani to accessory instrument. Not sure of the specifics so I just wanted to put this in."

I’d go to sleep at a decent time, then would wake up during the night. Now I stay up late and sleep in late. With eating, either I eat too much, or I don’t have much of an appetite.

Part of it is my fault. When I fall into my more negative state, I push people away. I have no interest in talking to anyone. I’ll turn down invitations if I happen to get one. I don’t ignore texts, but I’m more likely to if I’m feeling down.

Besides that, I don’t want to talk to friends anymore. Unfortunately I have to start online classes soon, meaning I’ll have to see them (it’s not in person, but still not looking forward to it).

We don’t HAVE to attend live classes since we can always watch recordings later, but I feel like I should at least do some live.

Also last time my parents found out about my mental health (they found out from a school counselor, not myself), they basically just got my hopes up for seeing a real therapist.

percussion,fi8cqcn,t1_fi8blct,1582237759.0,I agree! I’ve grown to love playing timpani
mentalhealth,fhfa7k8,t1_fhf72ar,1581539336.0,I guess part of my issue is I don’t want anyone else having to worry about me
band,fgkdgt7,t1_fgk9h0d,1580863010.0,"I get that. It’s weird for me though. I’ve done percussion for years and obviously I’m the most skilled in percussion compared to the others, but I’ve picked up a string instrument and a brass instrument and sometimes I gravitate towards those more."
mentalhealth,fg4fpa3,t1_fg33888,1580502538.0,"I’ve been pretty alright. I mean I’m a bit stressed, but that’s normal for me. It would be weirder if I wasn’t stressed. Sometimes I feel like I’m about to slip into that dark place again (in fact I felt like this about an hour ago) of not wanting to be here, but I somehow snap out of it. It used to happen where I would feel it coming, and it would overpower me and I’d constantly be in that state, but now it’s as if I’m overpowering it so it can’t take over me. 
Thanks for asking!"
mentalhealth,ffagu8x,t1_ff8b087,1579735425.0,"I get that. In fact right now I’m on the verge of a breakdown, and I am trying so hard to fight it.  Sometimes I just don’t even want to waste energy trying anymore"
percussion,fenvj8u,t1_fenv6bd,1579291553.0,So does the difference in treble and bass not matter then?
band,fel0bfx,t1_fekzlwb,1579211327.0,"The audition is this saturday. If it gets moved it would just be pushed back a week. I'm just wondering if it's likely they'll close due to a chance of a little snow, and then some sleet and rain in the afternoon."
band,feiejn0,t1_feidojc,1579136669.0,"For me it's happening when I'm playing my pieces for two music teachers. They're giving me feedback to prepare for my actual audition. I end up just feeling like an idiot (not due to them) and because my brain fails to grasp simple concepts when I'm nervous.

I wish you the best of luck on your auditition! I bet we'll both nail it!"
percussion,fe4re2i,t1_fe4ona0,1578862074.0,"Ah alright. I'm the only one who will actually be perfoming the piece. The audition committee only needs it so that they know if I'm actually playing it correctly.

Thank you, you made me feel a bit bit better."
percussion,fe4krmh,t1_fe4jmt3,1578860360.0,Yeah I just need to give a copy to the people in the audition so they can look at it. I don't want to risk forgetting the piece
percussion,fd5aprk,t1_fd4yng7,1578175795.0,"Thanks. I have another question how do you get better at differentiating between bass and treble clef? My brain automatically goes to treble, and it takes me a minute to switch to bass"
mentalhealth,fd3eedb,t1_fd3dvt8,1578157532.0,"Thank you, I appreciate it"
mentalhealth,fd33sxs,t1_fd3352a,1578154469.0,Yeah of course. I just get the feeling that maybe nobody *really* cares though
mentalhealth,fd31qp7,t1_fczxlxi,1578153886.0,Yeah I have someone. I just get way too afraid I would just bother and annoy them. I think that they don't deserve to be bothered with my problems when they have their own stuff to worry about
