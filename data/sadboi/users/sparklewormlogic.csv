Yeah I did talk to him about it properly, but I believe that actions speak a LOT louder than words. So the only way I’ll know if he changes behaviour is to keep checking if he’s lying to me with foolproof methods? And that doesn’t seem to healthy. I don’t want to be paranoid.

We are the creators of metaphysics and normatively, so honestly it’s up to us to decide. I just see it as an opportunity. There is either something or nothing, so I have nothing to lose by embracing the something whilst it’s here. It involves suffering, yes, but I choose to make my personal philosophy inclusive of suffering. I have told myself that suffering builds mental strength, which is something that I desire, and thus is a reason to keep going.

I know that ultimately I’m just making up things to keep myself going, but if you create a philosophy of things like this, suddenly life feels worth living even if there is no grand overarching metaphysical purpose. Instead, there are lots of little purposes that you have created."

Existential_crisis,fjmu1b5,t1_fjmc9ms,1583483994.0,"Yes I’ve absolutely felt the burden of existence and have been through long periods in which joy is totally impossible. And I have found no metaphysical purpose to our actions.

We merely act in order to progress. There is no goal towards which we progress. But we must progress. And the more we progress, by staying busy and working, the more we are satisfied because we are fulfilling our evolutionary purpose.

As humans, we are both cursed and bless with this metaphysical awareness I.e. we can comprehend our own mortality. As a result, we ask these metaphysical questions and they concern us, whereas they do not concern other animals. However, the positive side to this metaphysical awareness is that we can understand our own importance in a sense that other animals cannot. And we can reflect upon our own behaviours.

So use it to your advantage. Reflect upon *why* you feel this way. And if you have concluded that there is no metaphysical purpose, like I have, then maybe consider that you are asking the wrong question. We can’t the universe to play by our rules - to give us a purpose. However, it’s not about the “why”. The universe simply “is”, as far as we know. 

So with this, we can move forward and fulfil our evolutionary purpose - to be a productive species. To socialise, to create, to contribute. Even if there is no higher metaphysical purpose, we can create our own purpose to keep us fulfilling our evolutionary purpose. I.e. believe that the meaning of life comes from identifying challenges and overcoming them.

And overall, just live. Just choose to experience what is and experiment with your state of mind to see if that makes existence more tolerable. We have the advantage of being able to consciously change our perspective. Take in new information to the contrary and develop a worldview that allows you to live through suffering.

It is a wonderful mystery that we are here at all. And we can use that as good perspective. So if something is going wrong, I choose not to be distressed for too long as I remember that this is all transient and it’s all one big massive mystery and nobody has any idea wtf is going on, ever. Use nihilism in an optimistic, not pessimistic manner. See life as a ride and take it on. Stand up to the challenge of suffering and if you value joy, as it seems you do, try to change your mindset so that you gain joy from things that you wouldn’t usually.

For example, choose to be proud of yourself when you overcome a challenge. That’s some form of joy. And if everyday is a challenge, then there’s a lot of joy to be harvested!"
