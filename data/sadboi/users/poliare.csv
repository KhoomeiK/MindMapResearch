schizoaffective,fr2s757,t3_gl4muu,1589842869.0,"i think im coming out of a psychotic episode although im not sure the extent of how far off i was. i was having false memories of past lives and future lives and this life. thinking my house was haunted. i believe in God now (im not sure if thats a good thing) but i also believe in reincarnation. thought broadcasting, music and videogames were talking to me. thinking i was some fallen angel or some ancient god i seriously have no clue. i wasnt even sure if i was where i am right now, but in some other house with my mom. a female voice of mine is pushing sexual buttons. she knows exactly what to say to get me hot and bothered. its very confusing to be sexually attracted to a voice, but i guess thats not that strangest thing of all. i felt feared. im usually the quiet and sweet type. im also a very helpful person. i dont like feeling feared and i gotta tell myself it isnt true. i adopted a cat. her name is sabrina. its good to have another living thing living with me and not be completely alone. missing the rain. i dont post on reddit much, but im on this one and the other sz subreddit a lot reading yalls posts. i hope youre all doing okay and just want to say thanks to everyone for making me feel not so alone in all of this. nobody else gets it."

schizophrenia,fa0ojzu,t1_fa0bcxy,1575758037.0,"These are really cool and it seems you were in some sort of creative flow. I know psychosis has that effect, I would spend hours writing in my room just whatever came to my mind, I’m just wondering what that was like for you. I felt like the words were coming from some other dimension"

schizophrenia,f2860w5,t3_dcgxpl,1570053527.0,"Yes but what happens with me is I’ll be thinking of a memory and maybe my own or separate voice comments on it. Then I feel like I’m actually in that memory as me but there’s another me, the present me, and I can hear and see present me say what I said a second ago. It’s like present me when back in time and becomes part of that memory.. idk if that made any sense, but yeah I think it fucks with my memory"
