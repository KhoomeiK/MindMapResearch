Two geez why I am I angry? 1) His hateful anger he projected towards me and my mother in his unhappiness with us. The way he talked to me and treated me makes me angry, i was giving him money for my bills when he was clearly paying for someone elses.  He treated someone better, while he treated his daughter as a burden. He made my mom feel unhappy while he was galavanting with some &x#@. He also is doing exactly what his father did yo his mother that he so outspokenly hated. He is a hypocrite.

It is the last prophecies that will return everything as it was before Adam betrayed God and allowed sin and death of Satan into this world.  I don't know where you have been told these lies but it's obvious your heart is hardened. 

You are lost and I will pray for you. I don't understand your thoughts. You acknowledge God's existence but don't acknowledge Satan's. Why? He is spoken of many times in the Bible. Have you read the Bible? Do you believe in the Bible? Do you believe the Bible is the true words of God? 

You must have suffered something in your life to have such a strong hate for God so as of now Satan has won you because you blame God for everything. Do you blame your parents when someone else wrongs you or do you blame the perpetrator? If you can fight the negative thoughts and truly seek True God then maybe you can be saved but if you continue to hurl your hate your fate will end with Satan and all others who accept his lies as truth.

No your image of God is not True God. To think God likes destruction is false and those thoughts are from Satan to keep people from seeing who God really is, it makes people's hearts evil and full of hate so that they may turn away from God. But if they repent of those thoughts and their deeds he will gladly accept then back. God trains his people to fight Satan. To become better you must tear down the bad to the core to make it better. Just like working out it hurts and you suffer. Your muscles are being torn to rebuild to something stronger but in the end the result is good. To expect the Kingdom of Heaven to just be handed to people who haven't worked for it is childish. We must be remade, reborn into the people who can live alongside God when Revelation is fufililed.

Eph6:10-17
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.

Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.

For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.

Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,

and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.

In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.

Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God."

and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.

And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.

By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, in holy fear built an ark to save his family. By his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.

korea,fk7mzgh,t1_fk7lf6w,1583939730.0,The issue is the same when it's just hate. Hate leads to violence intended or not. It's called a mob mentality and your comments feed into it. Using foul language is also unnecessary as it just shows your ugliness verbally.

korea,fk7i3u5,t1_fk7hm42,1583936917.0,"Riiiighhht...whatever justifies people's blind hatred of others. So when future generations have to study history all your comments are cemented on the internet that people hate what they don't know or can't control. America had to accept that and their behavior, although some still try to justify it, in the treatment of blacks and Mexicans in history. Might not be the same issue but it's still hatred. How about the crusades?! Gonna go tar and quarter people for the sake of God?!?! Don't try and make it seem like I'm crazy when you're the ones praising and cheering for harm to come to others."

korea,fk7cfhy,t3_fgvujq,1583933404.0,"So two women died due to abuse by husbands trying to get them to leave the church?! Isn't this what the majority of you have been asking for? Well you got your wish, hope you're all happy after all the unnecessary hate you kept posting. Yet people still can't understand why they are so secretive?! People are actually trying to kill them. I bet some of y'all would relish in rounding people up and publicly killing then because, it's cool to hate what everyone else hates. Bunch of horrible people. I am glad the US has protections in place even if you dislike a church, Westboro Baptist, you can't go around saying kill them, burn them like some have said on this sub. That's a threat and the police take things seriously. And if some of you are Christian you aren't acting like it."

They never say all will be saved but only those who do what these chapters and verses say. Rv21:27 and Rv20:15 talk about a book of life. What is it and how do you know your name is written in it?! Shouldn't we find the place to do this? Rv7 says those who washed their robes white in the blood of the lamb are saved but it doesn't tell is how or where to do this.

God gave us the bible to learn who he is, what his purpose is and who we are in relation to him and his purpose. Read New Testament start at Matthew, read 1 chapter a day and from that chapter write a verse that stood out. Write questions as you read, pray and ask God to guide you to the one who can show you what true fait is and who God is and who you are according to the Bible."

Muslims believe Ishmael was the one that would receive blessings from God but it is Isaac for God promised that through Sarah, Abraham's descendants would be blessed. 

Gal 4:22-23

His son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way; but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise."

Eph6:10-20
Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.

Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes.

For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms.

Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to stand.

Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the breastplate of righteousness in place,

and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace.

In addition to all this, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.

Take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.

And pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints.

Pray also for me, that whenever I open my mouth, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel,

for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should."

Jn8:43-45
Why is my language not clear to you? Because you are unable to hear what I say.

You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.

Yet because I tell the truth, you do not believe me!"
