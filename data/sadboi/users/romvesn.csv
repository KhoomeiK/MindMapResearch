It was hard to find out, yes, especially because a lot of the symptoms involve hurting the people around you and it's hard to be so aware of all your flaws. But it's important to be aware so you can grow and change, have more stability in relationships and not just live your life being a unstable person who might be fun and crazy at parties, but also hurts a lot of people in the prosess.

The fact that they thought they could replace it with an ipad air is just laughable. The comments made to the sister about how little savings she has was unnecessary, though. Kids can be hella expensive, especially when there's 3 of them.

But I do have a question: why do you need a new apple pen? I thought the iPad was broken, if you're replacing it with the same model then the old one should work (unless they broke it as well). And I know that hindsight is 20/20, but if you really rely on this single piece of equipment to do your job, then maybe it's worth getting insureance for it in case this happens again? (Assuming you didn't have it since you want everything replaced.)

(Edit: changes it to ESH when I realised that you refused the downpayments and didn't even check if it could be repaired. You'd rather waste months and a more money on taking it to court, instead of trying to handle this situation in a way that it doesn't ruin your family relationship? Idk man.)"

BPD,f02fs5o,t3_d3firz,1568329759.0,"It's easy to feel like the world is against you, and I also feel like that a lot of the time. Bad things tend to fog our perception of everything and it can be hard to see past that when you're in the moment. And it really does sound like you need someone to open up to. 
I was very lost for a while after my FP broke up with me and didn't want me to come to her with my problems anymore, and I felt like I had no one to vent to or get advice from or just to listen to me talk about difficult stuff. And I ended up deciding to open up to two of my new friends who I hadn't known too long, and it was a great decision. One of them is my roomie and best friend now, and I can count on her to have my back. I don't know if it's that easy to connect with someone online, I do wish it was, but don't stop looking for someone you can open up to. Maybe it's someone you already know, but don't feel close enough with, or maybe you get to know someone new. And maybe also a therapist, if you're not seeing one already. It seems like the self-destructing thoughts are a bit out of control and those things might be better for a professional to deal with than a friend. I really hope you get the help you need and deserve, and I just wanna finish by saying that you are wanted, you do belong and even if it feels like everything you do is wrong, it's only a feeling and it will pass. Everything passes eventually.  I hope this helped a little and made you feel less alone, you are not the only one with these feelings and it's okay to feel this way sometimes <3"
BPD,ezxh5ui,t3_d2p0qp,1568240367.0,"Yes, I relate to this a lot. Money was an issue, although not as bad as your situation, but there were plently of other shitty things I had to deal with. One of the things I later in life realised I missed out on, and is still missing out on to be honest, is just having a mom who is present and actually listens to what I have to say and remembers it and asks about it later. My mom has schizo-affective disorder and most of the time she's in her own head a lot and everything I tell her just goes into one ear and out the other. It wasn't until my late teens that I realised that it was actually pretty normal for your mom to actually be involved and interested in things going on in your life. Like even just asking about how a school assignment went, or remembering things you told her about stuff going on with your friends. Several of my friends' moms would know more about what was going on in my life than my own, and it was painful to see others having so close relationships with their parents that I felt like I never had. I still try to talk to her about stuff, but I know by now that she's probably not gonna remember it or bring it up in conversation ever again. But the envy is still there when I'm with people who have parents that I wished I had, and it still hurts to think about what I've missed out on. I have accepted it now, though. It is what it is."

BPD,euktu3s,t3_cgmhax,1563893061.0,"It's really hard honestly. I feel like my ""solution"" to that is my partner just telling me when I'm being ridiculous (though it's not good to be dependent on someone to do that). But also I'm not sure that I pretend to feel a certain way, it still feels like a legitimate emotion at the time. Which doesn't make it easier either. I guess having people in your life who are not afraid to tell you if you are acting out helps you with figuring out those patterns, which can help long term. It's a pretty shitty job to tell someone with bpd that they are overreacting though. 
That being said, something that has consistently helped me get more in control of my symptoms is just to not do or say shit in the heat of the moment. If you are enraged by a text, then write it out on your notes and put it away for a few hours before looking at it again with a fresh mind and hopefully less feelings. A lot of the acting out is just strong feelings controlling you, so try to take a breather whenever you feel like your losing it. Wish you all the best!"
BPD,eue34oc,t3_cfy198,1563734104.0,"Altough having self-awareness sucks because we realise how shitty we are sometimes, it's also one of the best ways to actually get better and try to combat those behaviours.

BPD,etx46fu,t1_etwugkh,1563291110.0,"I guess there are several answers to that. First of all I had given up on therapy at the time when my bpd was at it's worst, because of shitty psychologists that I felt didn't take me seriously, so I don't know how I might have reacted if I was in therapy at my worst mental state. I guess I used my then gf as my therapist and that pretty much fucked her up really bad because she had to deal with me at my worst all the time. I really regret that. It was only after I had gotten the bpd diagnoses and went through a breakup with said gf that fucked me up more than anything had, that I started seeing a therapist regularly. When both those things happen, I think I started being a lot more self-aware over all the bpd behaviours, and also tried to stop doing them as best as I can. The breakup was the biggest wake-up call that I needed to get my shit together. 

So whenever I was in therapy I just felt so numb. As if I had used up all my feelings up until that point and then I was just ready to reflect on it. The only emotions I was able to show to my therapist was crying occationally, but i think that's also because I've always had trouble being vulnerable and showing my emotions in front of authority figures. She (the therapist) was also very good with bpd and knew what not to say to trigger me, so I think that is also a big part of the reason I didn't exhibit the behaviours in therapy. If one of my previous therapists said something that I didn't like hearing, I would just be so enraged or sad on the inside that I just showed no emotions until later when I'd take it all out on myself of my gf. That being said it would def have been better to show those feelings in therapy, but I didn't know how. 
I don't think I seemed to a therapist like a completely normal person, I think they could see that I was having issues with locking up when things got rough in therapy. And they clearly knew I was all kinds of fucked up from the stuff I was telling them, though I probably held back a lot of things too. 

And if I'm being honest, I always saw my inability to show emotions as a big weakness, because it meant a lot of people never took me seriously when I was hurt, because I didn't know how to tell them or show it. It does seem good to keep calm in therapy, but it just meant that the freakout later would be worse. However, after the breakup thing happen and I decided to try my best to be reflective upon my actions and not let my rollercoaster emotions run my life, it did get easier to genuinly stay calm in therapy. I would definitely say that I would never be where I am today if I wasn't so self-aware (which my therapist also said).

I don't know if any of this actually answered your questions, but I just wanna end it with saying that if your therapist thinks you don't have bpd simply because you don't show it in therapy, then that's bullshit in my opinion. They should know that most of the behaviour either is inflicted on yourself or the people you are around the most, not necessarily near authoritative figures such as a therapist. And quiet bpd is also a thing, though I know little about it other than that it's a lot more internalized than ""normal"" bpd. And if you truly feel like the diagnoses describes all of your behaviours, then you should get a second opinion or get the therapist to re-evaluate it and be open about the symptoms you're showing outside of therapy. 

I really hope you get the help you need, and that you get better (whether you have bpd or not). I sure thought I never would have a good life having bpd, but I have proved myself wrong and I'm better now than ever (though I still have symptoms regularly). So I hope you don't feel discouraged and like there is no hope of getting better, because you can. Just remember that emotions do pass, even when it feels like they won't, and shitty situations also feel less shitty with time. 

(Sorry if this got too long, I hoped it helped in some way.)"
BPD,etweeub,t3_cc3iev,1563266076.0,"I have bpd and honestly I have never acted out to any of my therapists. When I'm in therapy I'm just reflecting upon recent or past events from a distance, and I'm able to stay calm. I do (or have in the past, before getting a lot better) exhibit all of the symptoms of bpd when I'm outside of therapy, and I think it's strange if a therapist would claim you didn't have anything just because you don't exhibit all of the behaviour towards her. I feel like to me, the people that gets the worst of me are the ones I'm closest to (and thats not gonna be my therapists)."
unpopularopinion,ereooba,t3_c1jvjl,1560789267.0,"I definitively think that height is an issue that has been overlooked by a lot of the body-positivity movement, especially since a lot of people feel self cautious about their height. But also, I feel like I haven't seen as much body positivity around actual obeisity as a lot of people make it out to be. I don't think obesity should be glorified at all, but most of the body positivity things I'm exposed to seems to be more issues that people can't do anything about. Like skin conditions, disabilities and also stuff like height. And if I see weight related body positivity, more often than not, it's people that aren't dangerously obese, but chubby compared to the insane ""skinny supermodel"" ideals (without being a danger to their health). I kind of feel like the morbidly obese people in the body positiviy movement are the ones creating the most reactions and spectacle, so people start thinking that the whole movement is just dangerously fat people wanting others to also stay fat. This really isn't the side I see of the movement at all, and I hope there will be more focus on other things in the movement as well."
