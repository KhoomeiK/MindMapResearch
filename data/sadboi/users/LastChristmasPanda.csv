BPD,fopm04k,t1_fooz0ik,1587965113.0,"DBT is *way* harder for people to actually access than Concerta. There’s no single drug approved for BPD (for specific symptom clusters yes, just not for BPD as a whole. But that’s a pick n mix game and it’s going to be different for each person. Nowhere near as predictable as stimulants are for ADHD). 

The gold - and only- standard treatment for BPD is 12-18 months of intensive therapy (weekly group AND individual) to reconfigure deep and fast emotional responses that are as old as the person is.

Usually wait lists are at least a year. To pay for that out of pocket would be thousands upon thousands of dollars. 

Additionally, although ADHD of course causes dysfunctions that can be experienced by the person as wounding their sense of competence and mastery (and yeah people might call you a flake), many BPD symptoms are extremely challenging for others who are close to deal with. Anger, unstable relationships, etc. It’s much much harder to deal with than many things. That feeds back into guilt and shame. The constant play of emotions screws with people’s identities. It has far more profound effects on people who have it and those around them than many things. 

My sibling has ADHD, my dad has bipolar, I have a psychology degree, and I was and am still not equipped to deal with the BPD-driven rage expressed by my SO. 

He was diagnosed with this recently. (Took meds for a different condition religiously prior to that.) 

His psychiatrist said “you won’t benefit from DBT because it’s not oriented to men”. (I thought that was bull, but he turned out to be right about that). Told my SO to read Linehan’s book, which is huge and alienating without guidance, ps my SO hates reading at the best of times. Therapy MAY be happening now (two years after being put on the wait list).

So with BPD the symptoms are socially challenging and the treatment is expensive and hard to get. There’s your answer to the stigma problem. 

 (With ADHD, yeah you have to fight for the diagnosis and there’s some med tweaking but comparatively, it’s a dawdle.)

I look forward to someone making decent DBT videos, at least, if there’s not going to be major investment in therapy for the masses."

With my partner, really anything could be a trigger.     often, it’s goal frustration, as in he gets angry if he’s blocked from doing something he wants to do. 

In a relationship, though, there are always compromises and joint decisions. So sometimes, if  I have a different POV, need, or desire, that’s an opportunity for him to get angry because I’m seen as an obstacle. 

For example, he sometimes wants to do unreasonable things (like spend all of his money on audio gear, while all my money goes to joint living expenses). That conversation = a trigger.

Or he’ll feel like playing music loud when I’m sick (because he just got new audio gear and wants to test it...), me asking him to turn it down a notch = trigger. There’s something big or small every day. 

Sometimes he’s irritable because some other thing or person let him down, and he takes it out on me.

Bipolar: 

- distinct episodes of mania and depression, lasting weeks to months. 

- Episodes may have internal triggers or come out of the blue

- Mania is characterized by impulsive behaviour, grandiosity- and increased  *energy*. Staying up/ not sleeping many hours yet having tons of energy is a real tip-off. Rapid speech too. 

Borderline: 

- mood changes occur on an *hourly* basis, multiple times in the course of *one day* 

- Triggers are often interpersonal vs coming out of the actual blue. 

- often, there’s a history of abuse 

- it’s a personality disorder, shows up in ppl’s 20s, not usually late middle age. Unless they always had subclinical traits and something like an alcohol addiction reduced their abilities to inhibit and cope and it blossoms. 

- there’s often an identity disturbance. 

- key word: “emotional dysregulation” disorder. They can’t handle The emotions of day to day life, relationships are a minefield. Thin emotional skin, exquisite sensitivity.

SO: after about six months, started showing Jekyll and Hyde behaviour with me. I’d be thinking things were ok, he’d flip on a dime and the interaction would get *weird* - he’d get very critical, manipulative, cruel. Would lose his shit after perceived criticism or slight (keyword “perceived”).

Potential Confounds: 

- with bipolar DO, people can get mixed episodes ( Both manic and depressed). Thoughts are fast and flit between mood states. 

- some doctors believe in “rapid cycling bipolar disorder”, some don’t 

- both can have paranoid or delusional thoughts 

_________________

Mine also doesn’t make a big deal about me leaving him. However his sensitivity to rejection and need for attention are obvious in day to day ways. He hates any competition for my attention (like my dad who’s now old and has dementia, I have to take care of him). Won’t let me do anything if he wants my company. Wants my company all the time...

BPDlovedones,ffsw5cw,t3_euyl97,1580194885.0,"The stigma is fair in that most of the 9 criteria are intrinsically socially problematic. (Anger, impulsivity, suicidal behaviour/self mutilation [traumatic for observer too], affective instability, unstable relationships) 

And they only count towards a diagnosis if they disturb functioning. So it’s an intrinsically stigmatizing diagnosis. By definition. 

The only way to reduce the stigma is to reduce the social threat by providing treatment. 

Treatment is thin on the ground. Another obstacle is the lack of insight that many people w BPD demonstrate.

One could say a person w *treated* BPD doesn’t deserve stigma, but then the criteria are no longer met so, they don’t have BPD anymore."

I have to mention that it’s important to *stick to the dose*. My SO tried it last year, was very upset and took too many (for like weeks). This prompted a severe and sudden depression. So they took him off it - except the irritability/anxiety/anger got out of control. Now he takes it *as directed*, and it is working as it should. (Any drug could be a salve or a poison, it’s all in the dose.) He feels relaxed and good, still has full emotions but isn’t as often overwhelmed by them. It’s amazing.

I’m not a psychiatrist obviously. This was extreme. But two episodes in a decade - perhaps the future will be manageable? 

Hopefully she has decent care now.

The weed... I’m sorry, but I actually completely disagree with you. For people with bipolar, psychosis, psychotic breakdown, is a real possibility with marijuana use. It’s more likely with more frequent and long term use. 

My SO really got into weed around the time he moved in with me. (I don’t smoke, I did in my 20s but don’t like anything about it now.) Without his old picky landlords, he felt like it could be a free for all. So it went from weekends to most nights a week. I said hell no. What happened to your gf was my worst nightmare, that’s what I feared happening ... We fought about this for a year. He’s had some delusions and anxiety (and now he has COPD from cigarettes). But I think he’d probably minimize these and just keep smoking  it if I didn’t hold him to account and have some expectations around use at home. 

I disagree that it’s about “respecting her agency”. If there’s pot at home, someone who might lean on it for mood is going to use it. If her partner smokes all the time, there’s a peer influence as well for sure, a strong one. 

I used to smoke cigarettes. I LOVED cigarettes. Started at 15, they absolutely helped me cope. It’s no good to smoke, I know. I had some minor issues, so far so lucky though. 

Like I said, my SO has COPD, now. He needs to quit. I cannot in good conscience continue to smoke around him. My smoking would make it impossible for him to quit. If he doesn’t quit, he’ll end up with a tube up his nose dragging an oxygen tank around. 

So I’m quitting, for him, for me too, I do have minor things but they could go major, any time. and I’m glad I stood my ground about the pot, and I think you should seriously consider the possibility that pot did play a role in this, and ask yourself if it is worth it. What are the risks to her. What are the risks for *you*. 

I’m sorry I got tough there, after such a scary experience. In person I’d have more time and space for nuance. Also it’s unclear whether cannabis actually  did play a role here. But what if it did? If she went ten years without an episode, maybe it was due... maybe not. Personally I wouldn’t want to contribute to the risk."

BPDSOFFA,ffduobi,t1_ffbfl6r,1579829367.0,"Gabapentin has helped my SO (who has BPD) *tremendously* with agitation, irritability, anger, and anxiety. 

He has BPD traits and bipolar NOS, so he’s on a few other medications.

As you know, meds have to be targeted to symptoms, so he’s got lamotrigine and abilify for depression, and lithium as a more general mood stabilizer as well.

None of them could touch that anger, irritability, or deep anxiety. Neither could risperidone, seroquel... 

I’m talking about a person who raged on a biweekly basis, destroying objects and part of our place in the process. Someone whose anxiety was so bad he couldn’t walk down the street without flipping out. 

He’s extremely self-aware so he does have that, but formal DBT therapy hasn’t worked out yet. He does try to be as mindful as possible. 

Gabapentin is working for him, for the edgy symptoms, along with his personal work. 

I mention it because it works on the same receptors as pot. And he is a big pot fan. Doesn’t need it for coping, with gabapentin"

DEARMAN is just a guideline for good communication with anyone, honestly. It’s about being clear about your needs and empathetic. Sure reminding the person of the benefit to them of working with you *might* be slightly gamey? But really it’s just pointing out things that are a *mutual* benefit, everyone could do with that. So what could be a plus for your wife here? It will help you feel more relaxed and comfortable, which will likely set her at ease as well. 

What do you think her main concern is? Is it just the anxiety of being alone with the kids - in which case maybe help her find some activities like mommy and me- or is it something more concerning, like does she think you’re meeting women at work?

My SO has BPD (borderline personality disorder) and some of what you’re talking about sounds like that. Though of course  it isn’t necessarily that, and everyone has some traits of PDs to different levels."
AskPsychiatry,faj9bb5,t3_e8hjrs,1576128514.0,"Not a psychiatrist 

In order for memories to “stick”, it has to happen in the encoding stage, ie when it’s happening. Attention and arousal are important here. So it’s logical that if your attention and arousal were compromised in that period, the details of specific, episodic memories might be lost. (For example, memory loss happens when people are depressed - they usually have general, gist memories of times during episodes - this may be why.) 

I’m not placed to comment on long-term effects of antipsychotics. I understand your worry, though. 

But, neuroplasticity (learning reflected in brain changes) happens in adults, all through life, actually. The more you engage with the world and stay mentally and physically active, the better off your brain. It’s not helpful to focus too much on what might have happened as a result of antipsychotics - work on building and rebuilding circuits by living as well as you can. 

I will also note that your post is coherent and rather well-written, you seem more than capable of abstract thought.... are you very self-critical, perfectionistic (maybe yes based on the ED)?

The short-term memory issue - are you generally well, do you get enough sleep? Have you had a medical screen?

Again, I’m not saying she has what my SO has, obviously I don’t know. Maybe it’s just that she’s been severely affected by pregnancy and early motherhood. 

Doesn’t matter insofar as the communication techniques are concerned. 

You have someone who doesn’t want to be “abandoned”, and manipulates you to meet her needs at the cost of your employment. She is being irrational. 

DBT is the modality designed for this problem. 

On the one hand, You have to hold firm boundaries. consistently. You have to go to work, she has to learn to hold whatever emotions that causes in her enough to not disturb you at work. 

Google DEARMAN for help with that

His doc is the one who recommended trying the supplements (as an alternative to the zopiclone, before prescribing that), but I agree with you, happy to take any unnecessary variables out. Including the pot. 

He also struggles with anger and irritability, it’s unclear whether the medications have any part in that. Though it’s been a lifelong issue, I’m told, the frequency’s gone up in the past year. (Could be situational given the BPD. Therapy... still trying to set that up.)
