I get it it's really difficult, but graduating high school is no more than 5 years away for you and while that feels like a really long time it'll go by faster than you think and then you either go to college or find a job if you don't already have one, and you can also move out, you could move somewhere accepting and find a little group of friends that are ok with your sexuality and don't judge you for it, or in that amount of time people could change, and homophobia could be almost nonexistent it's unlikely but it could happen. Closets are difficult but eventually you can come out of it and be yourself, you'll probably lose some people along the way but in the end you'll be happier and better off without them, I'm sorry you're in that situation but it'll get better eventually."

BisexualTeens,fp0ejuh,t3_gajqxs,1588207737.0,"I'm no longer religious but I have a pan friend who is, she just doesn't believe that being gay is a sin, the part of the bible that says that in Leviticus when you translate it into its original Hebrew it basically says ""this guy should not lay with little boys like he lies with women"" so it's really against pedophilia, and that's in the old testament, so Christians don't follow it, in Romans (the new testament) it lists homosexuality in a list, so you don't really know which part of that list is a sin, it could be all, it could be one, and the story of the centurion and Jesus most say that Jesus heals the centurion's servant, again in Hebrew it actually translates to lover, Jesus healed a gay man, I think that enough shows that Jesus doesn't care if you're gay, he didn't say stop sinning as he said to the other sinners he healed, he just healed the man.  Of course, this argument only really works for Judaism and Christianity. 

I'm also not looking to get into a religious argument, if you think I'm wrong please save your breath, I'm an atheist, I don't really care about the bible, this is what I've gathered from my own research and what I interpret.   Please don't blow up on me."

It just takes time, and there's no rush to figure it out or come out, forcing labels does no good in the long term, take your time. <3"

BisexualTeens,fnblbtg,t3_g0r1kr,1586817570.0,"I used to think I was completely straight, mainly because I was uneducated on the topic but I would think everyone just thought girls were really pretty, I didn't think I was gay because ''nothing bad ever really happens to me'', I know stupid. I thought of it as a bad thing and pushed away the possibility, I never suppressed memories of liking girls mainly because I didn't think that thinking they were pretty made me gay, nor did I think watching lesbian porn made me gay. I came out once I wasn't homophobic but looking back on it I think that I forced myself to have a designated male crush (I'm a girl) every school year. 

Accepting yourself is hard, especially if you were raised to hate the gays, I grew up not even knowing about gay people until a kid at school told me what they were and that I could possibly be gay, I never gave it any thought because gay is evil and I'm not evil. I eventually discovered the internet and started spending a lot of time on youtube then I accepted gay people were a thing, I moved away from religion and did a lot of thinking, my morals shifted completely so I had to ask myself what I believed in and gave myself the possibility of being gay, realized I liked girls told one of my friends and it was fine. 

I hope you can learn to accept yourself, it is very confusing and scary but we all come out of it eventually, and if being gay in your household is still a bad thing I'm sorry, people come around maybe your family will."

BisexualTeens,fmdnnc3,t3_fulw1q,1585972561.0,"I think the majority of bi people can agree with the fact you cycle between gay and straight, because you like both but until you feel as if you feel like you've had enough experience to really know you don't believe you are bi. I've only been in very affectionate relationships with girls, we weren't dating it was like friends with benefits but only cuddling cause she was ace. I think you know when you cycle between them enough, I know because I like girls and guys, sexually and romantically, I think I would find it harder without the sexual attraction. If you can only experience romantic attraction then it's probably more difficult if you've never been in a relationship. But also sexuality is fluid, you don't have to be sure, you have an entire life for experimenting and experiencing how you do feel if you do figure it out this young that's great most people wouldn't think about it and some never figure it out.
