The pain of losing someone you love the most is undoubtedly incomprehensible. You really are a strong person as you shared your story with us. I hope her death gets avenged. My condolences are with you, pal."
SuicideWatch,fqzsyty,t3_gins3m,1589774650.0,"I know right, i know how bad that feels, it fuckin' crushes you from inside. And at a point you get used to all that pain that it doesn't even hurt anymore. And it gets even worse when they stop caring even when you're hurt. That feeling of being useless and lonely is just too overwhelming. It makes us cry every single time. I just wanna say that it hurts so so much deep inside ðŸ˜­."
