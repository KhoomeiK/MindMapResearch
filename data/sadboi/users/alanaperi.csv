AskReddit,fisv53c,t3_f9kd1v,1582694274.0,"One time, in the downtown area of my city, which is a city that is known for sex trafficking, i was paying for a parking meter. A lady came up to me, her english was broken and it seemed like she wanted me to help her with her parking meter, the one in front of mine. I stepped towards her meter but then i realized a dark SUV was parked in her place. I got a really bad feeling, her urgency seemed off. I explained to her that i couldn’t help her.

After I refused, she got angry with me. She said “I was trying to help you!!” And then she jumped in the backseat of the suv and it drove away. This seemed so scary to me and i called my dad and he told me that it was most likely an attempted abduction. 

I feel like I was steps away from my death. It was honestly such a crazy experience."
