bipolar,f2pdzpy,t3_ddxf2z,1570341546.0,"I guess I'm in the minority opinion here, but I liked the Joker movie. Something about seeing someone else go through the spiral that he did just made me feel not alone. Like I get not being able to control your emotions. His laughter is my version of crying when I shouldn't be (like at work). I understand the embarrassment and how people don't get that it's something you can't control and that it may not have anything to do with the situation. I get what it's like to feel so unheard because people look down on you. I get what it's like to have unachievable dreams because of a mental illness. When Thomas Wayne said that poor people are where they are at because they didn't try hard enough, I felt what the Joker felt. Even down to the abuse he had because of his mother -I get that. That scene where her was ranting on the talk show? I get that. The anxiety he was feeling when he realized he couldn't get his medication anymore? I get that. 

The murder part is something that I obviously don't relate to.  That said, I think it is necessary in the context of the movie. When I saw the movie last night, a lot of people in the audience laughed whenever the joker did something ""weird"". In contrast, I felt sad whenever he did. I was able to empathize with him because I know what he was feeling. People who are neurotypical don't understand the pain that he felt whenever he laughed out of context. They understand that it's not right and that there is something wrong with him, but they can't relate that to a painful experience. The murders that the Joker commits act as a visual cue for them to understand. Sure they don't understand severe mental illness, but they understood the level of anger the joker felt when he committed those murders. They understand being mad and wanting to hit something. Obviously, I don't condone murder in anyway, but as a device in the movie it is necessary. 

Also, I'd like to add that there are plenty of comic book villains who are neurotypical  who murder people. 

Lastly, the overall message was about economic disparity and mental illness. It's not a movie about murder. I think that the average audience member will be able to understand that. It's a fictional movie. They won't go away thinking they need to be scared of mentally ill people."

AskReddit,ev7s5t6,t3_cif95z,1564263645.0,"There wasn't a single incident it was more about putting pieces together. 

The start of my moving away from the church began in my English class in high school. We were learning about debate and were asked to go to one side of the room if we against gay marriage and to the other side if we were for it. Now, I was a straight A student in high school and have always been fond of academics so when she had asked that I really thought about it. I was from a small rural town in the deep south so I was raised to be homophobic, but I was being taught in government class that there needs to be a separation between church and state. Putting two and two together, I went to the ""pro"" side, while ***literally*** ***everyone else*** in the class went to the ""anti"" side. Like all teens I was awkward and self conscious (and also in the closet queer). So, imagine how I felt when my teacher asked me to explain my side. Of course everyone else in the class felt like their religious freedoms were being trampled on and I never really understood why. Anyway, this is when I stopped believing that christians were fundamentally more moral than other people. During my senior year in high school I had a huge falling out with all of my church friends (who I've known since like first grade) because of my beliefs on gay marriage (on Facebook of course). Even there parents started leaving paragraphs on my wall. This of course left a bad taste in my mouth right before I left for college. 

In college, is when I actually 'came out' as an atheist. Like many, I was faced with more diversity in religious and political thought leading me to question many assumptions instilled in me. What made the biggest change for me was joining my colleges Unitarian Universalist (UU) club, which I would lated become the president of.  A lot of the students I met came from the same type of religious background as myself. While they didn't all share the same religious beliefs (some were atheist, agnostic, Buddhist, some even christians etc),  they all shared a belief in [the Seven Principles](https://www.uua.org/beliefs/what-we-believe/principles). These principles were pretty transformative for me because they helped articulate what I believed in. It was sort of like a stepping stone off of the 10 Commandments which wean me off the church.

Anyway, I left college a completely different person. While my conversion story really isn't anything special, it led me to having beliefs based on reason and empathy. Which I feel free to change given the right evidence. I try to be a better person now not because I don't want to go to hell, but because I want to reduce world suck."

AskReddit,erakhqx,t3_c140li,1560646440.0,"My mother told my father that she wanted a divorce on Thanksgiving. She told him while they were in the basement and she called me on the phone (I was in my room, upstairs) and told me that I need to come downstairs because my dad was crying. My father never cries so I knew something terrible had happened. I ran down stairs and she was sitting on the couch and he was on his knees crying on the floor. She told him to tell me why he was crying and he told me while he struggled to breath. She was so apathetic about the whole situation. The actual divorce was hell and she forced me in the middle of it every step of the way through. She wanted to stay in the house (4 bd/3br and an in-ground pool), but she didn't want the house under her name or his. So she somehow forcibly put it under my name and my cousins name (she's sort of like a sister). I'm not sure how she did that because I never signed any documents, but whatever. She basically promised to pay for the mortgage and didn't. My mother married a man who had a house but my father had to pay the mortgage for several months because she basically refused to. I cut off communication with her soon after she stopped paying. She's always a victim so whenever I confronted her about it she acted like my father should be paying for it because apparently he made her like hell for like 20 years. Eventually  he went to court to get the house back in his name (I had already signed it away because I never wanted it in the first place) so he was fighting for the other half. 

&#x200B;

The divorce was terrible, but honestly I didn't expect anything better from her. She had always been a self-centered asshole and emotionally abused me my entire life. She was most probably mentally ill, but honestly I don't feel bad for her. I've never loved her and now I have so much hatred for her. I plan to never see her again.
