Within days Adam's body is found in a ditch (freshly killed, still warm) and upon autopsy they find KFC in his stomach. Still haunts me.

Two: Chris Watts gave an interview to the same interrogators he originally confessed to, about six months after being in jail. He admitted that he had killed his wife and stuffed her dead body in the truck, loaded his girls up in the backseat (alive, in their jammies and favorite blankets) and drove them out to the oil field.
