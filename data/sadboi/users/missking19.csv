MakeNewFriendsHere,fd0keuz,t1_fd0iczh,1578120084.0,"no one has ever asked me this... I'm kind of excited to answer. Very corny warning: it hurts to leave the house most days- I feel very in tune with the world and what She goes through. Yoga has been one of the the only things that allows me to let go of that heaviness. I don't fit in  anywhere around me, never have, but Yoga truly provides me with this deep sense of home being within so I feel a little less lost and a little more welcome here in this life than I do otherwise."
