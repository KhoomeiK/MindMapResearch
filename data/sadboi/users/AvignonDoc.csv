No shade to them but the training is just not the same as a doctor.

premed,fqkbl6b,t1_fqkalkb,1589423940.0,Most of those cases are from people that were stalked and harassed irl. Online you just don’t have that same effect when there’s no irl connection since you can block people. I’m a “see both sides” kind of person. If they’re claiming that he sent them messages harassing them they should post it before trying to slander.
premed,fqk9t2n,t1_fqk91k7,1589422928.0,🙄 his response can be due to the backlash not because he sexually harassed women. Again flirting does not equal sexual harassment. You’re calling them “survivors” like he raped them or abused them.
