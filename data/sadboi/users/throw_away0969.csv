SuicideWatch,fk8tbfq,t3_fh0abe,1583962517.0,"The American health care system is fucked. My brother took a bunch of pills. We took him to urgent care, not knowing where to go. They said he needed to go to the ER. the ER is only a 4 minute drive away. The got a bunch of paramedics and firemen at Urgent Care then made my brother (who was honestly fine, just experimenting with cough meds to get high) ride in an ambulance for a few minutes. That 4 minute ambulance ride cost my mom a thousand dollars. On top of that, for the three hours he was there, they made her pay another 1000. Two thousands dollars for a little ambulance ride and three hours in a hospital room. It‚Äôs like they want people to be ill just so they can suck the money out of them."

Sometimes you just need to leave. Leave that place in your mind. You‚Äôll never get all the answers and that‚Äôs okay. Find the beauty in life and focus on that. Listen to music you love. The intricacies of the vocals and instruments. Eat your favorite foods. Feel the textures and temperatures in your mouth. Go outside and immerse yourself in the countryside. Escape in the beauty of reality. Everyone knows this world is fucked, but there is still beauty and life surrounding us, we just have to look."
