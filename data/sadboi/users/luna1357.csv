We were never safe but that is being swept under the rug because it's inconvenient for everyone)  And so you see states coming forward saying ok, fine, you can stay home and we won't take your unemployment away because you shouldn't have to choose.

I've cried every day since this started and prayed that I could find a way to stay home and still get paid so that I wouldn't risk my life or my kids lives, but the government didn't have an option for essential workers besides quit and hope you can qualify for the unemployment deal but then have no job to go back to.  So that wasn't an option.    And even with all the exposure and the thousands of people cramming into my store and the people screaming at me every day for having to follow basic guidelines, I'm still standing.   All you can do is wash your hands like crazy, and try not to let the public get to you.  I'm assuming you won't be getting Walmart sized amounts of people coming in every day so that should help.  I know with anxiety its even harder...trust me, I'm there.   But you will get through it.   Just be as careful as you can, and hold your ground against the people who refuse to give you 6 feet of space.

I figured it out, and in the last 2 months, I would have made about 5000$ more not to work.  Plus figuring in what I spent in fuel to get to work, plus the risk to myself and my family.

The infection rates at the grocery stores are obviously high because they are jam packed with people all day long.

SandersForPresident,fp92m1o,t1_fp74ga6,1588411911.0,"Really no matter how good any of these companies treat their employees during regular times, we all deserve more hazard pay that anyone is getting.  To be one of the few industries not only being forced to work, but work in a place where thousands of people A DAY are coming in, you are putting your life and the lives of your family at major risk.  Look at how everyone right now is saying ""it's unsafe to return to work yet!!"". Now realize that some of us never got to LEAVE work.  When I think of how highly I've been exposed...how highly so many of these workers have...no option for us to stay home safe on unemployment (most of us are making waaaaay less than if we were actually able to stay home on unemployment) hazard pay should be 25$ or more an hour for these months.  I think when everyone keeps saying, ""well that company pays decent so what's the problem?"", They are forgetting that so much more than that is deserved for the sacrifices made by these people to keep America fed."

Coronavirus,fp7k7mo,t1_fp66jgs,1588372179.0,"No one was following that anyway.  Every single ""essential"" store that's been open this entire time has been jammed packed with people coming in for non essential merchandise.  They were never enforcing the whole don't come out unless it's life sustaining anyway.  Trust me, i work in one of these stores.   I've had to be exposed to thousands of people a day because no one cared to follow that rule in the first place."
retailhell,fp6vb1a,t1_fp6t46i,1588359203.0,I think if that was the case she wouldn't have been joking about it.   More thank likely she's just entitled and thinks it's ok and also funny to come out during a pandemic for bullshit reasons because she's above the rules and doesn't care about others
retailhell,fp6bdlk,t3_gbkfaf,1588349422.0,Hopefully she chokes on it
Coronavirus,fp6axcx,t1_fp5sz5w,1588349198.0,"You should totally be able to take off, paid, until this is over.  That's crazy.  I'm praying for ya!  I'm so sorry it's this way!!"
Coronavirus,fp56frc,t3_gb8d4a,1588317911.0,"Tell this to the millions of us that have had to be out here facing thousands of people a day to keep everyone fed, because unemployment and staying home was never an option for us.   We were thrown some masks and gloves and told to shut up, work, be grateful you have a job even though for most of us it would have paid more to get unemployment.  It's so interesting to us hearing everyone say how dangerous it is for them to return to work when we've been held hostage at 10$ an hour for the last 2 months serving the thousands of people coming into our stores for God knows what every day.  I wish atleast if it was too dangerous for these people to return to work, they would atleast stop shopping for nonsense because they need something to do while they are sitting home.   So crazy to tell half the population that their life quite frankly doesn't matter and to shut up and do their jobs without asking for any extra compensation, and tell the other half it's not fair that they should have to return to work after 2 whole months of being able to stay home.  And on top of it allow those people to clog up every essential business for things that aren't life sustaining with no real enforcement of the stay at home orders.  This has been real great.   Thanks America."
Coronavirus,fp252wr,t1_fp24ir7,1588255307.0,"1) I don't work for Amazon 2) all I said were the facts, which are that anyone in these essential jobs did not get to have the privilege of staying home, we had to either go to work or not get paid 3)yes we make less than what the unemployment bill paid out 4)I think we have all figured out by now that someone has to do these jobs, am I correct?   No matter what, people are having to be out there making less than liveable wage to feed you through this.   5) What everyone is considering a choice (aka ""just quit then!"")... Quitting and being left with no job, vs being furloughed and hopefully having a job to go back to are definitely different things."
retailhell,fp22yr5,t1_fp22r5t,1588254073.0,One word... entitlement lol
retailhell,fp22rb3,t3_gauzou,1588253946.0,"Yes, yes, yes.  I feel like you took this directly from my own thoughts.  These people.  They just do not even realize how vile and entitled they behaved through this.  And how badly we wished we COULD have stayed home, and how we would have been more than happy to be respectful of not going out and being an entitled shit head if we were fortunate enough to not be working for poverty wages to die for them."
GroceryStores,fp204sp,t1_fovj8ah,1588252263.0,"Many people though, for instance someone working at a small chain that's making maybe 10$ an hour, this isn't going to give them a whole heck of a lot.  Shame to shaft them again on top of how bad they already have been shafted.  I'm hoping they do come up with something besides this.    Also I laughed out loud at your #2 haha.    There is a better chance of me growing a 2nd head over night than that extra 13$ an hour being passed lol"
Coronavirus,fp1rw5l,t1_fp1qnv8,1588245920.0,"No, sadly you are most likely right.  As an essential employee who's been making next to nothing to be forced to risk my life through this for less than I could have made to be furloughed and on unemployment, everyone kept saying, WELL THEN STRIKE!  UNIONIZE!  DEMAND FAIR PAY!   unfortunately all that would probably do is get my fired so I just show up every day, keep quiet, and take the abuse because I had no  choice.  I am rooting for them though!   It might not do any good but atleast they will get to speak up and say, Hey..we are people too!  Our lives mattered as much as everyone else who was being told if wasn't safe to go out!  Compensate us!"
retailhell,fp1rem9,t3_gapwdb,1588245468.0,"Yeah that's seriously messed up.  I'm a grocery worker so during this time I've tried to avoid going into any essential business because I know what it's like to be stuck working through all of this and seeing people crowding into your store.  In the few times I did have to go to a store I was so extra dang polite, followed every policy, tried to make my presence as little as possible, thanked the employees, and then called in compliments to their corporates each time lol You would think that we all would be supporting each other right now as essential employees knowing how screwed we all got this last 2 months.  I hope someone screams in her face about policy on her next shift lol"
Coronavirus,fow9ti7,t3_g9sk8e,1588115682.0,Cool.  I've been forced to work all this time In a busy crowded Grocery store for peanuts because I didn't have a choice.  I can't even fathom what it would have been like to be fortunate enough to have a choice.  But it's too risky for them to go back.  Neat.
retailhell,fow8kvj,t3_g9v1ey,1588115015.0,"All I can say in support is, if you felt the strong need to get out of there, it was probably for the best that you did.   I hope that you are able to find something better.  I know all too well that feeling of being beaten to death by your job but afraid it's your only option.  Good luck to you!"
Coronavirus,fow7vhq,t1_fovv735,1588114640.0,"The 2 issues there are though, that essential employees don't get that option, so we have risked our lives for half the pay, and also sadly, this hasn't really made anyone stay home.  The essential stores are jam packed with more people than they ever were before, every day, start to finish.  What we hear most from everyone is that they needed to get out of the house...I'm so bored not working, etc.  I see what you're saying there but it's been a really hard pill for us to swallow...not only being forced to work, but knowing that we are making half what we would have to be home safe, and then having thousands of people in our faces all day talking about how bored they are.  I think I mentally could have handled being shafted better if everyone did stay home, because then I would have known I was sacrificing myself for the good of everyone else."
Coronavirus,fow70y5,t1_fow1hy5,1588114193.0,"Yes, we are getting paid far far less.   I make around 350 to 400 a week to work full time through this entire thing, In a busier than heck grocery store where I'm in contact with thousands of people a day.  :(. Trying to home school my kids on top of working full time, trying not to get sick and give it to them.  Im not sure what the idea was here...but yes, we are getting paid far less and have no choice but to show up every day."
Coronavirus,fou315m,t1_fou0ejo,1588074766.0,"Haha yessss I'm there with you.  We've been working unsafe this whole time, and with everything closed and everyone not working..they aren't staying home, but rather coming to places like home depot for a good time lol. All the sudden there we are, elbow to elbow with millions of customers that weren't coming BEFORE the stay at home order, and there we are, being forced to work and being over run with potential virus carriers.  It's fine if no one wants to go back to work but if that's the case can they PLEASE actually enforce the whole ""stay at home unless your life depends on it for food or medicine"" instead of letting everyone run wild.  Our essential lungs depend on it.  We have no choice.  We HAVE to be at work whether we feel safe or not!"
Coronavirus,fou2kao,t1_fou0mae,1588074370.0,"Definitely.  Dont get me wrong, there is a big part of me that's so happy for all the non essential retail people that are making so much right now (we should all be getting paid like 30$ an hour to have to put up with the shit we do) , but there's that part of me that's thinking, hey I'm a low paid worker too, and I'm still having to be out here suffering low wage, risk for my life, AND the absolute crazy rudeness of customers right now (you know what it's like dealing with the retail customer on a regular basis...right now their rudeness is on steroids) I just want to atleast be making equal to unemployment so that I too can have that extra money for a bit instead of planning what bills I can pay now and what I have to pay late when my next paycheck comes.  Ive been doing that all my life  lol.  It doesn't look like us essentials are going to see any substantial hazard pay though from the government, and I'm not expecting our companies to bump everyone up to 20$ to beat that unemployment rate so I guess it's being poor AND getting the Corona for me.   Funny part is, I was in non essential retail (clothing) for my whole life... just switched to grocery in the last 2 years.   Kinda regretting they decision about now haha"
Coronavirus,fou0dlt,t1_fou02bt,1588072430.0,"That's my point though.  There are essential employees right now that are working to survive...to pay mortgages...just like they have always had to.  And they are making less.  I've been in retail my whole life and I've been getting paid shit wages my whole life.  I'm over 40.  I do this to pay my bills.  I barely make it.  I'd love some extra money.  I'm essential though so I'm still just getting paid my shit wages, am im working my tail off.   I don't think retail jobs are for teenagers obviously because I am a retail worker who is old as heck lol. I don't think ANY of us deserve poverty wages.  My point is...we are still over here getting paid poverty wages as Essential employees, and we are risking our lives.  That isn't right."
Coronavirus,fou02gq,t1_fosxwoz,1588072147.0,"Thanks.  Can't say I'm surprised.  The lawmakers seem to have their heads the entire way up their asses at this point.  If they don't give some real incentive for people to be risking their lives, I am wondering how much longer people will be willing to do it for"
Coronavirus,fotzw2x,t1_fotxryx,1588071981.0,"Look, we are both getting screwed in our own way.  We are both I'm sure, not bad people, but 2 people who are angry with what is happening to us in this situation.  I feel for you that you're unemployment hasn't gone through.  I believe that you want to work.  I believe we BOTH can agree that the people that are sitting pretty at home getting paid probably shouldn't be complaining that they have to go back purely because they are getting paid more not too, when there are people like you suffering, there are people like me suffering.  You have to understand that it has not been easy being forced to be face to face with thousands of people every day, possibly getting something that could leave my children motherless, and im making half what my neighbor is getting to be outside on a lounge chair reading magazines and painting her nails while I'm trying to work and home school my kids.  Though I'm not a fan of you insulting my children, I hope we BOTH  get some kind of justice in this crap situation."
Coronavirus,fotzhob,t1_fotvmsl,1588071607.0,"That's what I'm hoping for too.  The amount of people coming in because they are bored is unreal.  I'm praying that once other places start to open up, I will not be shoulder to shoulder with people all day who just wanted something to do besides sit at home.  It's making an already unsafe and stressful environment even worse with everyone cramming into the only open stores"
Coronavirus,fotv8oz,t1_fotub9v,1588067337.0,"Exactly.  This is what I mean.  The government has created a situation where no one wants to go back to work because they got a raise to stay home and not work at all.   Meantime there are people who had to work harder than ever through this, expose themselves to thousands of people, and are making like half of that unemployment.  They REALLY should have thought the blanket 600$ through.  Some people got like 300 and 400$ a week RAISES to stay home.   So they should not be surprised that no one wants to go back to work.   Hell, if I wasn't being held hostage at my essential job and I was getting that kind of money to stay home, I would not want to go back either.  The ones I really feel for are the small businesses.  There is no way they are going to be able to top unemployment payments to entice anyone to show up to work.  Crazy country we live In"
Coronavirus,fotuxcw,t1_fotb0zo,1588067013.0,How true.  But no one seems to care about that lol.  Been exposing myself to this all along ... thousands of people cramming into my store every day.  But that's safe right lol

Coronavirus,fotsp7y,t1_fothhio,1588064741.0,"Here is what confuses me though.  So plenty of people had part time jobs, making what...200$ a week, just working for a little extra income for their family or maybe they are a student or adult child living at home.  Now they are getting 600$ a week.  So they just got a 400$ a week raise.   On the other hand you have full time workers who are making half that.  I'm sorry but what was the thought process there?   What in the world is the incentive to go to work.  And really, why is in on small businesses to raise their wages to 19$ an hour to try to compete with what the government just did?"

Hey you know how your pissed that people are having the nerve to complain about going to work and risking their god damn lives every day for absolute shit wages?
