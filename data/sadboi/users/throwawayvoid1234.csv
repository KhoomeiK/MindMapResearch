Whatever happened it doesn’t define you. Those people (if we can call them that) are just scum of the earth. I’m sorry you had to experience so much pain. 
You are a hero, you make the difference. I wish I could take away your pain. Please, know you are loved and admired.

I’m just feeling a bit overwhelmed. Been bottling up emotions for several months. I can’t believe my friend is gone, it was a cancer and after treatment it took over him by surprise completely. And I was completely devastated. Spoke to his crying mother and we cried together.

I wrote some words that are going to get read tomorrow at his funeral. I live in another country so it makes it even more painful.
He was one of my main supporters in everything. And now he is gone for ever.

A part of me knows I shouldn’t hurt myself but, on other note, I’m feeling incredibly anxious and depressed because of the constant rejection I receive because of being a single parent.
I feel a cord on my throat and after being really good for a while, I feel I really want to put it all off. Prepare some insurance for my family. And just die once and for all.

I have no one here in the real world. And I have to pretend everything is fine. 
It’s killing me inside."

depression,ex3hbc9,t1_ex2wd7g,1565985521.0,"Lol. 
The only thought of a surgical procedure makes me shudder. I hate hospitals. It’s ok, I think that sometimes when things don’t work out is for the best. I learned new skills. That’s always good. You know, I was not also prepared for the real life. It hit me hard reality. Also the incredible stupidity of my hometown culture, the misogyny, the cult of beauty, (which we are living now more than ever)....I knew I would never fit in. I was always odd and strange. With time I knew that this is one of my best qualities.
With time I also understood that our parents are only human too, and also ignorant, just as much of us will be or are parenting. It’s not easy. But please know you can always become your own person. Because those things don’t define you. And it may take a long time to fight stereotypes, no matter your race or credo. What matters is to try to find a little light among the darkness which is reality. 
I still don’t have a joke but, in the call center I worked at I spent 20 minutes addressing a guy with “ma’am”. It was until that time he told me his name and that he was a MAN. I felt so bad but also what should I know? It was very difficult to know 😂"

I was working non stop, 40 calls a day or more listening to insults and really strange people, even stranger than me. I learned a lot, met some really cool
people. And that’s that. 
Maybe I can try and enjoy my life a bit now.

I guess I got used to the crap being crap. And I did felt like crap! But now feel better and hoping for something better.
I’m up for a chat any time! Like any time! Crying is also important. It’s like the release of emotions, so fuck anyone that doesn’t like that.
When I cry I’m like well this is me.

Wanna chat? 
I really enjoyed reading your words. Strike me as a very introspective and mature person. No matter what you have lived in the past, remember it’s behind you now. Although it may seem dark and pointless, you will surpass this situation. Getting help is the first step. So congratulations on that. I’m more than glad to talk. Today I was told off from my job so, there’s that. I’ve been depressed since I can remember. I have been in treatment for a long time. Things have been better, some days not so much. I wish I had a joke.

AskReddit,esd5y6e,t3_c6rg4s,1561848009.0,"I developed big breasts in fourth grade. I wasn’t aware of anything really. I was a quiet, lonely student but bullied every day by the “popular” boys and girls of my class. No matter what I did, they would always make fun of me.

One day the popular boys came to my desk, teacher was gone, four of them started grabbing my breasts and touching my genitals over my skirt while I was trying to get them off me. The whole class froze. They were laughing like crazy.

After that I only remember I was crying and the boys begged me not to tell the principal. These people were the son’s of important businessmen and high profile families. Back in the day bullying was not taken as serious as today. I was confused and scared. I didn’t want the bullying to escalate or embarrass my parents who were already struggling and all of our family with their divorce. 
So, I kept quiet. 

The whole school knew and it became some kind of sick and disgusting legend. I was bullied still but those guys kinda left me alone. Needless to say I still think about it to this day and am fucked up about it.

Nobody defended me. One of them tried to pull the same stunt on fifth grade but I managed to tell him off.
I don’t know about the fate of these people. 

Thank you for those that protect and stand up for victims."
