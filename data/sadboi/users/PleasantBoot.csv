On a side note (if you don’t mind me asking) do you know if the Phrygians might’ve shared the same language family (or close to it) as the Greeks, or if they were influenced by Mycenaean palatial society? I read someone that one of the few Phrygian inscriptions out there supposedly made and dedicated to (or from?) Midas has him with the titles of some variation of ‘Wanax’ and ‘lāwāgetās’, which the ‘lawagetas’ part seemed pretty strange, because from what I gather that title essentially died off among the Greeks after the Mycenaeans unlike Anax and basileus."

 *A new breed of Republicans has taken over the GOP...*  *It is a new breed which is seeking to sell to Americans a doctrine which is as old as mankind—the doctrine of racial division, the doctrine of racial prejudice, the doctrine of white supremacy.*  *We must fight them in the churches. We must fight them on our jobs in our union halls. We must work and struggle and sacrifice… \[to\] ensure that Goldwater-ism and extremism and anti-Negroism will be so brutally defeated that they can never again threaten the future of America.*”   -Jackie Robinson, who supported Nixon in 1960, worked with Republican Governor Nelson Rockefeller in the 1964 GOP Presidential primary who was Republican up until 1966, on Barry Goldwater

Schizotypal personality disorder is thought by some psychiatrist to be on the same spectrum or genetic linkage as Schizophrenia, but patients with Schizotypal personality disorder often don’t experience persistent long episodes of psychosis like patients with schizophrenia do, but can go on to develop into schizophrenia. Schizotypal personality disorder is characterized by having weird or eccentric beliefs and magical thinking (the whole random signs from god is a prime example of such) as well as the negative symptoms of schizophrenia (self isolation, being disorganized, problems with motivation, eccentric clothing and hygiene choices).
