aerosols:¬†infectious viral particles that can float or drift around in the air. Aerosols are emitted by a person infected with coronavirus ‚Äî even one with no symptoms ‚Äî when they talk, breathe, cough, or sneeze. Another person can breathe in these aerosols and become infected with the virus. Aerosolized coronavirus can remain in the air for up to three hours. A mask can help prevent that spread.
