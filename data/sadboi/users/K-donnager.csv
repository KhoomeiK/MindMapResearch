asktrp,fprbn5g,t3_gexeov,1588849357.0,"Wow for a second I thought I was reading one of my old posts. My first friend I made in grade school is the exact same way. Him and a few of my other ""friends"" ditched me first weeks of Junior High for no real reason and it shattered my confidence for years. For some reason through outings with mutual friends we ended up hanging out at bars when we were all of drinking age. I talked up alot of hunnies and held alot of confidence and got us into clubs for free then so I think he wanted to associate with me because of that. 

But few years later once I got a degree that I didn't get far with his behavior changed and he moved to making me the guy to rip on all the time (only when other people were around of course). I realized only last few years despite some deep intellectual conversations, he's never been a good friend. He's overweight and hardly tries to take care of his appearance either, so some of his flak could be jealously idk

Last January I invited a bunch of people including him out he started ripping on me again and after laughing off his bullshit I almost dropped him. I'm still close friends with his younger brother but I've accepted that he himself is socially retarded and not worth my time.

Depending the context you could cut this guy in your life off full stop. Because you just know if you try and bring it up he's gonna frame it like you being too sensitive. Fuck these haters."

I would tell my younger self to stay true to their morals and not let other lead them astray just for a fake place to fit in. To focus on discovering the things you love, whether it be music, sports, art, or software and ONLY focus on that until it bears fruit. Because while you may miss the parties and crazy nights out, you'll be years ahead in setting yourself for a future and have something to be proud of.

selfimprovement,fmhej4r,t3_futy7p,1586076854.0,"Same. I came from a lower-middle class family always trying to keep up with the other rich kids in grade school and as a result I wasted aloooot of money and turned down opportunities and relationships which might have made me happy to instead seek more. I almost finished my crazy party phase by 20 but moving to a new city for University, the rollercoaster started all over again I didn't know anyone and wanted to fit in.  I went out partying and and drinking with rich guys as I guess I was fun to be around when drunk but I honestly made a bad name for myself to the peers I really felt at home with in my academic program. Once my party friends graduated University and I was still attending I rarely heard from them and didn't know who I was anymore . Barely finished Uni. 

Now I just want to work any job so long as I'm with genuine people. OP as you get older you realize your lifelong friends and family only like you for what you are now - not what you want to be so I encourage your to make a new network.

I regret not writing a paper on it like I intended to as this was before the huge surge of it over the last couple years and men need to hear the truth. In my own educated opinion I believe  higher ups don't want men to be strong to question authority so they pacify us with things like porn, discouraging confrontation and physical violence, and giving women a sense of power over men.

Doometernal,fl9bid2,t1_fl2d3k4,1584948268.0,"I'm a little past halfway and feeling about the same. At first I had so much appreciation for the new elements like new types of demons and shooting chunks of meat off of them while they're still fighting you but they took the Arcade elements WAYYY too far and it really cheesed it up. 

Doom 2016 had it arcade elements and subtle humor but it still felt gritty and you felt like a badass. In this it's become such a farce. Some climbing is cool but they got you jumping around like a monkey with cartoon character models, neon colors, floaty guns, and I laughed out loud when I saw the spinning lava rods. Things like the extra dash powerups start taking away from the freedom and self reliance of the slayer forcing you to play the devs way. They hold your hand through so much of the game it feels like the game assumes the player isn't intelligent. 

Based on Hugo Martin's interview with Joe Rogan I get the impression he was thinking too much about a younger audience like his son rather than targeting it towards a more mature audience (which it should have considering the gore, but that's just imo) still like the game, just don't think it'll have much replay value for me."
Doometernal,fl8p708,t1_fl8j9e0,1584928933.0,"Yeah resource management for sure. I really didn't like how the Doomslayers meelee punch turned into a wimpy bitchslap unless you have Blood Punch, because if you're out of ammo and out of chainsaw fuel you're pretty much fucked.

 You commit to that thing and you can't do it for anyone or anything but yourself. It sounds selfish but in that act of not caring about the world and it's bullshit you bring out a piece of gold from within. As you get better at this thing you can start to become a part of a community (online or IRL) and start to give back. From there things will compound like interest and only get better."

I think you have to be insane to truly get by in this world. To pretend it's NOT fucked up that we are slaves to the government and consumerism. All either of these care about is money and they use virtue signalling to justify their actions. Most people are innately selfish and only really care if there's something to be gained from it. Most people don't care about you as a person, they only care about the way they've categorized you and how that reinforces their own reality. You can't get by in this world just being a good person because sooner or later malevolent people will take advantage of that.

Didn't realize I needed that class for the extra credits required to get into the best 3D modeling and film classes the following semester so I fell behind technically. 

Mom passed away that summer, and despite appearing to take it lightly I ended up taking a semester off my second year to go backpacking in Europe. Amazing experience but I returned to school a stream behind my class peers and wasn't able to reintegrate socially.

 I reverted from being a fairly popular guy who finally liked himself for the first time in his life back into the shy loner I was in Junior high. Offered an internship final semester but they pulled it last minute. When they reoffered it 3 months later I let my pride get in the way and said no. 6 years later never landed a job in my field.

You can't escape what's happened, you can't go back to who you were, but you can decide who you want to be tomorrow. If you really think talking through things with a therapist will make you understand yourself by all means but understand they are only a conduit to discovering your true scars so you can make sense of moments gone by. Keep in mind it can be easy to let this keep you trapped in the past instead of moving forward. You need to reach a point where you move past grief and reach anger where you can spark the fire that will initiate action in your life. Prove to yourself and no one else that you are enough. You are strong. You got this."

Work your ass off to find a job. Be strong to keep the past in the past and move forward.

I applaud you for having the balls and commitment to even get married. I spent most of my 20's chasing my youth acting with no regard for responsibility. As a result I lost a girlfriend of 5 years. She was initially the sweetest person I ever met but as a combination of long distance, my friends disrespecting me infront of her (and her following suit) me breaking up with her for both valid and invalid reasons multiple times, she  eventually lost all respect for me and  became very wicked against me. By the end of it she was only using me for physical validaton and kicked me to the curb the moment she found someone else. When I tried to be friends she blocked me on everything. I started seeing someone else 2 years later last fall but she was no where near as caring and it felt cheap so I ended it. I'm starting to accept that I won't get married and have kids the way my friends and stepbrothers are. 

But if I can play a good video game, read a good book here or there, and help support other people like these subreddits maybe life is still worth living.

depression,f8hvzq9,t1_f8hcgax,1574580801.0,"31 here and I second what GangreneMachine has stated. Invest in yourself first and hone your skills while you have the time and energy, never place your security in someone else's boundaries. Address the issues in your family and long term friendships now or else they'll fester. Communicate to those you  are about when you're feeling like isolating yourself. Write a journal to document your thoughts and etch out your sense of self as depression can always change your feelings on a whim causing confusion and make you look insecure or unstable to those around you. Don't live by other people's expectations but MAKE SURE you damn we'll do your research when making a major life decision or you'll shoot yourself in the foot."
