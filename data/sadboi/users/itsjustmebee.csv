I have the same problem. I am utterly embarrassed by them-an ex told me I looked like I have bed bugs, and since that comment I haven't worn a short sleeve shirt around anyone but my mother and child in about two years now. I hate it. I love wearing cute sundresses and tank tops, swimming is one of my favorite hobbies, and I love hiking. Sex was pretty much out of the question for a long time because I didn't want to scare off any new partners and, in turn, feel even worse about myself. So, I feel your pain completely.

I've been researching different products to help fade my scars and so far have had a lot of success, but unfortunately, I just have to be patient until they eventually fade enough to make me comfortable again. So, let me just say-I am sorry you are going through this. Truly. It is *awful.*

Things that have helped me the most: Good quality foundation (I use Tarte Face tape foundation and concealer), self tanner, and lots of over shirts. I have a full wardrobe of loose, flowing over shirts (think like kimonos, light cardigans, shawls, etc) that are not heavy, and make sense to still wear during the summer months. I don't wear long sleeve shirts by themselves, I just wear whatever I would normally wear during the summer, with a lightweight cover over it.

I know the reasonable answer is to not care what anyone thinks about you, and to shut down inquisitive minds. But I know as well as you do that's easier said than done. I do think it's a good idea to come up with a vague answer to stop the questioning-since you work in a customer service type job (as do I) being rude in response to their questions isn't the avenue you want to take, even if the inquiry is rude to begin with. I would think of a vague answer that would satisfy most people, and if they push it, a breezy ""I'd rather not discuss it any further"" with a smile and change of subject will do the trick."

relationships,fmsphl9,t3_fx46wu,1586359883.0,"I could have written this almost word for word, four months ago. I was not married to him, but we had the exact same problems you outline here.

I know that feeling of waiting up in bed for a partner who won't join you. A partner that would rather get drunk alone than be intimate with you. Who doesn't want to be affectionate unless they are just the right amount of drunk. And clams up and acts incredibly reserved when sober, and you try to talk to them. And then somehow makes it your fault that they have these issues. You put more effort into your appearance and it goes completely unnoticed. You really start to believe there is something wrong with you, to make them not want you.

But that's not the case.

Look, the hard, cold truth is alcoholics do not change. Not until/unless they are ready. All the yelling, screaming, fighting, talking, therapy, ultimatums, ignoring, or love in the world is wasted on someone who is chained to the bottle. 

That is the hardest thing to accept. I still struggle with it every day. I think maybe I was too harsh, maybe I should have given him another chance, maybe maybe maybe. But you can't live your life on maybes and somedays. You have to take a look at your life, at your partner, as it is RIGHT NOW: Is this how you want to be for the rest of your time on this planet?

If not, then you know what you have to do. It fucking sucks. It hurts. You're watching this human you care so much about turn into a shell right in front of you, and there's nothing you can do to save them. You feel guilty, like you shouldn't be giving up on them. But you have to think about yourself here. And your kids. 

As hard as it is, I can promise you, the peace you feel, the relearning to love yourself, and the eventual love you can get from someone who is NOT an addict, are so worth it.

But that's not what you said ! You brought up sharing feelings and weighing pros and cons, which is not applicable here. Your girl could have had the conversation  before or after she made her mind up-it shouldn't matter when, if you're really *just* looking to be educated, right? My point continues to be this: a woman does not need to have this conversation *before* she decides to stop. Yes, it's good to have it. But it doesn't need to be run past her partner *first*. 

**This isn't a joint decision.**

 I can see you're defensive and I'm not really sure why. I wasn't attacking you. I'm glad that you want to understand why a woman would stop taking birth control pills.

I am saying, and stand by this, that stopping BC pills specifically (not protective methods all together) does not need to be run past your partner first. If a woman has a reason why she doesn't want to take them anymore, she doesn't need to weigh the pros and cons with her partner. ""I'm going to stop taking birth control regardless of the consequences"" please tell me what consequences you as a man will face HEALTH WISE? The only negative consequence that would impact your health is if she continued to have unprotected sex with you without telling you she went off birth control. Clearly not advocating that.

I agree that a conversation should be had, but only about the alternatives and what they both agree to use going forward. The way you are wording this is that a woman should wait and see how her man feels about it first. Almost like she needs permission. Why? If she is feeling sick, why does she need to justify that, or wait for his argument on why she should continue feeling shitty? This isn't an even playing field.

Too often we get wrapped up in our own feelings, and can't see the logic in the situation.

If you are feeling physically unwell on birth control, you have every right to stop taking it without waiting for the green light from someone else.

It doesn't need to be ""I am thinking of stopping taking birth control"" it very much can be ""I stopped taking birth control for xyz reasons. What other methods can we explore/discuss?""

I can't tell if you sent mixed signals, or this is a manipulation tactic on her part, though it reads like the latter. But even if she got the wrong message from you-it hardly matters. She knew you two were at least rocky, she made the decision to keep the baby. If she had some misguided belief that this would save your relationship, she is naive at best.

How old is she? Not that it matters but this does come across pretty immature on her part. If she is very young, I imagine she is scared shitless at the thought of doing this ""alone"" (not being in a relationship, that is) and thought if you two spent enough time together you would change your mind. She thought the baby would bring you back together. 

I think it's **incredibly** shitty that she is all the sudden wanting to give the baby up, and even shittier that anyone is trying to bully you into agreeing. I think your response to her father was absolutely appropriate; he is way over the line.

It's interesting that you are somehow the asshole in their eyes because you WANT to *keep* your child. Typically, people get up in arms when a man does not want to take responsibility. 

You already have a lawyer, so to address your moral concern: **you are absolutely NOT an asshole for wanting to keep your child**. Not at all. If this was a woman in your shoes, every person in her life would have her back. 

Baby mama/daddy drama is the absolute worst, but you keep doing whats right for that baby, OP. He/she needs you. Don't let anyone try to tell you otherwise. 

I am pretty angry for you, and could rant all day about this! Please, do not let them bully you into submission. If you want this child, you will forever regret it if you give in to her demands."
AskWomenOver30,fjhu4sw,t3_fde4sk,1583355107.0,"I honestly think her heart was in the right place, and if anything, she is perhaps a little awkward. 

I *think* she is trying to say that the earrings aren't her style. She didn't want to just outright tell you that for fear of hurting your feelings. And instead of letting them collect dust, she is ""gifting"" them to you, and bought herself something that is more her taste.

Definitely an odd way to go about it, but I think she's really just trying to do right by you by not having you spend money on something she won't wear. She knows you like them, so she gave them back to you. 

Personally, I think that's a good friend, OP. I know, it's strange. But consider her intentions and let it slide."

It's about respect. She's at home with the kids, he's out partying with his buddies, where alcohol is involved and women she doesn't know. We have no idea how she would have reacted had he told the truth, cuz HE DIDN'T.  

The whole ""I would have gotten in trouble if I told the truth"" argument is lame, IMO. If what you're doing is innocent and you feel no guilt, then why lie? Tell the truth, you do you, and let the chips fall where they may. But he didn't do that. 

If you want people to trust you, give them a reason to. I think it's unfair to say she's just jealous and controlling and unable to trust him when he literally LIED TO HER.  ""Sure, I lied about one big thing, but the rest is true, I swear! Why won't you believe me, you jealous and controlling bitch?!""

He should have called his wife and explained the situation. Instead, he and his buddies got drunk with random women in a hotel room. I don't think I am far off by saying most people would be uncomfortable with this. This is not how you behave in a relationship/marriage. Well, not if you want it to last, anyway.
