I'd like to know how this is possible lol. Please be less vague.

So now the proposal is:

1. pay to build properties for at least half a million homeless people in the US
2. give homeless people free property while simultaneously destroying property values for everyone else
3. indefinitely pay their utility bills, property taxes, any repairs and plumbing that might be needed in a home occupied by homeless people who are often addicted to drugs and prone to self-destructive behaviors and mental illness

Anyway my main point is people who are traditionally marginalized deserve recognition and the proper response isn't to tell them that the majority of society is awesome too.
