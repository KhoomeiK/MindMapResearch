The littlest things like what your wearing, tattoos, conversations you could be having, your hair, just something that puts you apart from the rest. And it’s also very situational. So if your at a social event or something where it is pretty normal for strangers to approach each other it’s more than likely you could catch the attention of some one. Also you probably aren’t as ugly as you may think."

virgin,fnnetk6,t1_fnji3z3,1587090726.0,Yea I’ve been warned about this by many people. Never date your co worker. But it sucks because work is the only time I interact with women. I would like to spend more time with her especially 1 on 1 so I can get to know her better. Usually at work she will come into a conversation I’m having or try starting one. And most the time we will just kinda tease each other by making some silly joke.  So as of now if there is any woman I might have a chance with I feel like it would be her
virgin,fnneagw,t1_fnjeal7,1587090382.0,"Very true, but I have a feeling she could figure out if I was a virgin or not if she asked around. But besides that, I’m trying to think of ways to hang out with her 1 on 1. Not for any weird reason or anything but so I can really get to know her. Most times I’ve been around her is at work or if a couple of other co workers go to a bar together. I don’t want to make it awkward or feel uncomfortable. I wanted to do something simple like a hike or even just getting food. But I’m still too scared to ask. But we will see. We’re still somewhat messaging each other so worst thing that can happen is we just stay friends."
virgin,fnk4pgc,t1_fnjru6v,1587014893.0,"I’m sorry you had to go through that, and thank you for sharing that story. You know I really had a crush on another girl a couple of years back and I could see myself getting a little too attached. I one day found out she had a boyfriend and I literally felt like my heart sunk. It didn’t take long for me to get over it because I realized it wasn’t meant to be anyways. She is also free to be with whoever she wants so I have no place to be upset. Then it made me kind of happy because I could finally let her go and move on. 
But now with my current situation I’m afraid it’s happening again. This time I’m trying not to get ahead of myself but damn it I really like her. I’ve even stopped masturbating because it made me uncomfortable when I starting thinking about my crush...I do want to tell her how I feel but i can’t handle that rejection..."

Also, being a 26 year old virgin sucks because once it does come up, people act soo surprised or don’t believe me. But I also get this odd feeling from my crush that she almost knows just because we happened to go to the same high school but didn’t know each other at the time.

The pressure from society making it appear that to be a man you HAVE to like sports or you HAVE to like cars. I once got called a “gay” because I wore a pink shirt. It’s always a dick swinging contest and ego trips when being around other men. But it also shows how insecure and uncomfortable those people are with themselves. I know it’s not going to mean much but do not be ashamed of who and what you are. But it is also your choice and right to define yourself.

It just makes it all even worse when I can’t even get a freekin girlfriend because I’m so damn pathetic. I tried watching some of those videos and I just don’t believe in them.

virgin,f94vnpc,t1_f94unaw,1575105906.0,"I have never asked out a woman on a date before. If I find a woman attractive I automatically put it in my head that she is way out of my league and I’d be wasting my time.

I tried online dating, absolutely hated it. It all felt so fake and I always cringe whenever I try taking selfies or posting profile pics and my bio. It just all seems so artificial I couldn’t get myself to do it. I have this problem with social media in general. Surprisingly had a few hits, but once again I ran into the problem where I thought they were way out of my league so I didn’t trust it or just didn’t have the courage.

Eye contact has always been an issue of mine. When I’m in a conversation with someone I have no problem with eye contact. But whenever just walking past someone and suddenly make eye contact I always look away or I just have tunnel vision and look straight past people. If I don’t have to engage in socializing I avoid it as much as possible due to my social anxiety.

But overall people tell my I’m a decent looking guy, I’m in decent shape and have a good sense of humor. But there are also times I’m cold, distant and try avoiding people which I know everyone I knows picks up on. So when it comes to women maybe they just don’t know what the hell to think of me sometimes.

It’s hard not to compare myself to others. Usually all I’m left with is disappointment in myself or self conflict of my own ideals. Am I in control of my life? And if I am, why am I not satisfied with my life? Am I just doing this to myself? Will I ever find my passion?"

pcmasterrace,f2dhnfk,t3_dcwg8b,1570154458.0,Mah boi that setup is clean. And it looks professional
Crushes,f29cf88,t3_dcjkol,1570091637.0,Yea it freekin sucks
Crushes,f29celn,t1_f28bfqu,1570091606.0,Yea that is true. I’ll try and be patient but usually even after a few days or even weeks she won’t message me so I can only assume she just isn’t that into me.
Crushes,f27qd0x,t1_f27dgpv,1570043885.0,It’s mostly always just a yes and nothing else. I still really like her but I don’t want to waste my time. Guess I’ll just have to move on
Roadcam,f1yz1o4,t3_daxtb2,1569828326.0,That would have pissed me off to no end. Like there was just a goddamn couch literally in the middle of the road. Can you even make a claim for something like that? I mean you do have it on video
forhonor,f1yypka,t3_daxwrp,1569828084.0,"I love/hate for honor. It’s one of a kind, I can’t even think of games that even have similar gameplay mechanics. It’s such a amazing concept. Even when I try to explain the game to people, all I have to tell them is you get to be a knight, samurai or Viking and the goal is to slaughter each other and they get hyped."
forhonor,f1yvz8j,t3_db61wg,1569826087.0,Damn dude that was sick af
Crushes,f1yqe3y,t1_f1y68cd,1569822032.0,Thank you man. I really want to hang out with her so I hope I don’t f this up
Crushes,f1y5zyf,t1_f1x05wn,1569810086.0,"Yea I messaged her again and got no reply. I guess I’ll just leave her alone for a while, I’m just worried because I’m not really sure if she is doing to well right now..."
Crushes,f1xu576,t1_f1wyrlu,1569804125.0,So I messaged her. No reply....not sure there is something else going on but I’m pretty sure she doesn’t want talk to me.
MortalKombat,f1wbv94,t3_dat5jc,1569782829.0,I loved how you kept the pressure by forcing him to block and grabbing him. Also liked how you freekin read the Kano ball and caught him in the that spinning attack. Good stuff
nosurf,f1w9zfk,t3_dap1ul,1569782175.0,"It’s not that strange really if you think about it. People love watching sports but not all of them actually play sports and that’s been going on for ages. So it sounds like you still have an interest or appreciation for video games, it’s just you would rather watch them be played by some one else."
drawing,f1sj717,t3_danngo,1569729621.0,Sexy as hell. I love how realistic it looks
medical,f1ndeyc,t1_f1mf0tp,1569614674.0,I was thinking of that too. I really hope that’s the case
MortalKombat,f1lxtz5,t1_f1lm5i4,1569575216.0,"ITS LIKE LOOKING, IN A MIRROORRRR"
Anxiety,f0uni48,t3_d6iel6,1568945449.0,I have so confused my whole life why this happens. I was not aware how bad my anxiety was up until recently. I used to feel like I was gonna have a panic attack every morning before work. There are even times where I can barely stand or breath. Even before bed I get these random panic attacks. I absolutely hate these moments.
NoFap,f0pkkyj,t3_d5unb7,1568836625.0,Yea my main issue is my main fapping spot is my bed. So I have to try and put my phone across the room so I can browse. I also like to fantasize way too much. Wish it wasn’t so hard to just stop
