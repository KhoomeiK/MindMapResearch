Normally we would just go out or scavenge whatever was in the kitchen, but I decided to cook breakfast for the family for once. I made everything as best as I could as I was doing it simultaneously, so some things ended up being overcooked or not enough flavor. I served it anyways and hoped everyone would still enjoy it. Everyone was content for awhile until my Dad took a bite out of his pancakes. He immediately spit it out and said ""It has no flavor at all."" We were all out of syrup and butter so I didn't expect them to be amazing but still, out of being hurt I said ""If you don't like them you can make them yourself old man."" He got very upset, demanded that I remake them, and was confused as to how I could mess up something as simple as pancakes. At this point I was ready to throw his plate in the trash for being ungrateful, but I saw the sea salt on the counter and stomped over to him and started putting it on his pancakes. He slapped it out of my hand and told me to leave the house immediately. I instantly picked up one of his pancakes and slapped it on his face. Meanwhile, my siblings were watching as this went down and quietly judging/picking sides. So my sister threw her bacon at me from across the table, and the whole house erupted into a food fight.

depression,f1f1gjw,t1_f1ebbdv,1569435005.0,"Completely agree, so many people are worried about you actually being diagnosed with depression or any mental illness, to give you any sympathy about your feelings or lack thereof. You obviously don't feel like yourself, are unhappy, and/or just don't have the energy to get help, labels are irrelevant.


Also, if your boyfriend has any issues with comprehending what Depression is, send him over here. We've helped a lot of others understand their significant other's mental difficulties and how to assist them when they're in really deep."
depression,f1dhwe3,t3_d8xld6,1569384694.0,"I disagree with the other guy, do what you feel is best for your mental. I dropped out and you will not believe the immediate immense sense of relief, especially since I had depression-induced sleep issues due to attending classes. Not to mention not having to deal with the toxicity from others and possibly teachers when you'd miss, judging you for something out of your control. You could easily take that time to pull yourself to together and fortify your mind back to what it was. Because you may not even necessarily be that sad on your own, it could just be that environment you're subjecting yourself to because that's the path that everyone else follows. I honestly say take a semester or so off and see how you feel, before it suffocates your mind even further and potentially leads you to doing anything you'd regret."

depression,f1cz3eb,t3_d8v9e5,1569369598.0,"My main theory actually builds on that. There are people who are alive and those who are, well, human bots. Those who are alive, each are living their own personal hell. The bots are just there to make us feel inadequate and seem as if being rich, a celebrity, or even just being happy, is actually obtainable. While we're just given enough drops of satisfaction in our own lives to prevent us from ending our existence, while still throwing contant issues and trauma our way. The perfect form of torture.


Now, either all of that is true, or I have way too much time on my hands and I'm very traumatized. Normally don't speak about it, due to its extremely pessimistic nature and I also don't necessarily believe it either. But it's something to think about, especially since you referenced Black Mirror."

That seems so sudden like, for example, if he caught you cheating, but it sounds like you really loved him and wanted to spend the rest of your life together with him, so I truly doubt it's that. I don't know, this seems like such a jump, he's probably just a narcissist like I said earlier. Fuck that's crazy, even though it doesn't do anything at all, I'm deeply sorry and I wish I had something to help you out. I'm trying to find my own way too and it's very difficult."
depression,f1cc78u,t1_f1c5iox,1569354533.0,"Doesn't really matter, that system is instilled in every first world country, especially those that have a capitalist economy. You can easily be replaced by anyone else for most jobs nowadays, even those that require further education, and if you can't find value in your job, then you must look elsewhere. What happens if there isn't an elsewhere, your family is distant and seperated, don't have a significant other, not many friends, you end up questioning if life is worth it all. This is exactly why the number of persons with mental illnesses grows everyday, especially depression.


Systematically there's nothing we can do, this has been the direction of our society for decades. Only at the point that we're all replaced by AI/robots will we realize the fault and it'll be too late.

depression,f1c4d09,t3_d8on27,1569349627.0,"What the? I'm sorry but did he really say it to like that directly, *I'm done with you* and *I don't love you*. He makes you out to be a play toy, which is a red flag for narcissism. I guess it doesn't matter now, but he's definitely no man if he ended things in that manner.


I had a similar thing happen to me a few months back, except we weren't married, but I still only saw a future with her and basically threw everything else to the side because of it. It's difficult, for awhile, I'm still reeling from it till this day, especially since I don't really have anyone. If you have friends still, I'd definitely lean on them for awhile, it's really surprising how much others can pull you out of the deepest hole possible. But don't give up, if not for yourself, just out of spite to that guy for letting you go so easily. He sounds like someone who would find joy in hearing that you went through with it because it meant he was your everything and while he very well may be, don't let him have that. There will be another person who will give you the same love in return and who will actually fight everyday to keep you by their side. For now you just have to push through, it's a rigid process, but it's worth it. The people in this subreddit will always be here to hear about your frustrations if no one else."

That's not your decision to make. If they react a certain way to a stimuli, who's the say it's not the correct response.

While you may mean nice, you're invalidating their feelings by acting as if they have no idea what their talking about, when you don't know them nor have experienced a day in their life. It may seem hard to believe based on your life experiences, but not everyone lives the same life. If you don't have anything good to add, then there's no reason to reply to the post.

On the other hand, as with autism, no, I completely understand that they naturally come into this world feeling the effects of the imbalance, that causes the defect."
