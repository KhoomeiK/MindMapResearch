I was absolutely inconsolable, she was my best friend in the world at the time, until an officer brought me to her trunk, and told me she had some friends for me who needed some love, and a new friend, because they were too tired of being brave like my stuffed leopard Snowy was, and needed me to be brave for them now. She helped me pick out a bear- which was actually the angriest scariest bear I'd ever seen when I reencountered it as an adult- and it gave me something to focus my love and fear on until it was safe for them to retrieve our stuff from my moms totaled car a few days later, including my beloved Snowy.
The bear was never my best friend, or even treasured by me, but he served a very important purpose, and I stand by the belief that he absorbed my nightmares from the incident and sped up healing from being rolled 3 times and having to lie there suspended in a car seat until a stranger could come rescue me and my mom."

helpmecope,es5ah84,t3_c5zr44,1561605791.0,"This is fairly similar to what I went through growing up, and I'm not much older than you (almost 23), but I will tell you what I know can help a lot: therapy. Therapists are not just there to help you cope with yourself and your life, but to help you decide what to do in these kinds of situations. If you're not already in therapy, I would seriously consider it, even if it's just to keep a handle on how stable you are right now, before working on improving.

I also know that as much as you might want to, blowing up at your mom won't help. If you have someone close to you you can vent those feelings to, do that. But she probably won't listen, and it will just strain your time there worse, and make her less receptive to listening to anyone, even professionals, in the future. Couples therapy might help them, it might not, and I'm sorry you have to go through this with them this whole time.

There's little stuff you can do for yourself, like making sure you keep in contact with friends, and taking time for yourself while home with them, even if it's just taking a walk, or wearing headphones and enjoying a film, or making yourself a meal and doing a picnic in a park somewhere out of the house for a bit. Even just in your backyard, away from your family for a bit where it's a little easier to breathe. If you have your licence, offer to run errands, get some time out of the house for reasons they'll see as productive and you can just have some space.

If you're close with your brother, you should check in with him, too. It's been really hard for my brother to stay living with my parents and their relationship, and I know your brother would probably appreciate a little help, if you have it, too."

Or that Caitylinn isn't  ""kate-lynn"" but is ""katie lynn""?

It doesn't give you an excuse to scream that I'm stupid and make fun of me in front of all your friends and laugh and loudly ask others if I'm stupid or should even have my job when I trip over trying to answer someones question and say ""salted cream cold foam cold brew for Drew"" at the same time.
