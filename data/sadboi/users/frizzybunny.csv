HelpMeImPoor,fqd14yx,t3_ghseg5,1589276024.0,"I love love love food. I love going out to eat and exploring new places with friends. But it is hard when you have no money.  But I've learned that it doesn't mean you have to miss out. I have eaten my way around NYC with barely any money and these are the things I used to do it:

1) [nationaldaycalendar.com](https://nationaldaycalendar.com) \- There's hundreds of food-related national days every year, just check out what there is that day/week/month and then google what restaurants/places are offering free/discounted food to celebrate. This year I've gotten free donuts, pancakes, burgers, taco's, frozen yogurt and more. It's fun and free.

2) FoodForAll App - This app shows you where you can get discounted meals at local restaurants & cafes that have a surplus that day. This saves you money and reduces food wastage. You can get gourmet meals for as little as $4 sometimes. 

3)  Birthday Rewards - Sign up at every food place you can think of for their birthday rewards. Come your birthday you will get coupons e-mailed to you for so so so much food. Some places even offer items not just food. 

4) Use apps - Food apps in general usually offer huge discounts and buy one get one free deals and more. If you don't use an app before eating out you are just throwing away money.

5) Youtube/Blogs - I often watch videos about living in a 'city' on a $1 and these videos usually show you really cool places you can eat for really cheap. It's a fun and exciting way to find new places to try without breaking the bank. Cheap-eat blogs can also direct you to many many cheap and delicious secret locations. 

6) Leave reviews - If you had a meal or food item and weren't satisfied with it, contact customer support and let them know. On most occasions they will hook you up with a voucher for a free next meal. I wouldn't abuse this, but if you are unsatisfied, give them the chance to let you try again. 

7) Food Delivery Sites - Sometimes food delivery sites have really good deals like $10-$15 off your order. Sites such as grubhub, doordash and seamless. Take advantage of these when you can. You can even order to pick up at the restaurant and then just eat there like a regular customer. Just make sure to OK this by phone beforehand. 

8) Groupon - This site is great for finding cheap restaurant experiences. Sometimes you can get 3-course meals at a restaurant for 2 people for like $7. Check the best options near you and don't forget to use student discount on top of that!

Don't forget that being frugal doesn't mean you can't enjoy every aspect of life!"

I owed a similar amount and my mum hounded the college financial office day after day after day about how unfair it was and that they were discriminating against people with mental health issues. They also said medical records weren't enough but eventually, my mum got them to drop the owed money. I can't promise your school will be as compliant and it did take us months to get them to drop it. But don't take no as no so easily. Good luck."

KindVoice,fpm84y0,t3_ge9olp,1588727514.0,That is pretty rough. I think the main problem here is her not telling you that she had tinder and that she's been speaking to women on there. If she isn't out as gay or bi-sexual then it might be she was too afraid to tell you and has been using tinder to express her feelings. I would confront her about it openly and calmly. Tell her you love and support her but you need to know the truth. Once you know the truth you can adjust how you go forward with things.

curlyhair,fpj83uu,t3_gdrkm3,1588659451.0,"I'd say the most important thing that made the biggest difference for me is properly hydrating my hair. This involves using high quality nourishing hair masks at least once a week but preferably more. When my hair is properly moisturized it curls more just by itself. The masks I use that I love are: the jessicurl deep treatment mask and shea moisture manuka honey and yogurt.

I hate the feeling of gel so I use jessicurl rocking ringlets styling potion followed by their spiralicious styling gel. Their gel isn't really a gel texture, it's a liquid ,and these don't make my hair hard or sticky so I like them. If you want to give them a try you can get free samples from their website. I never really found a shampoo/conditioner I loved but I've heard good things about the NYM curl talk line.

In term of results, I think one of the most important things is your method of styling product application. I'd check out videos on that on youtube and find out what works best for your hair.

Good luck!"

I think the main difference from what I've seen/read is that people with just depression find it like they are living life with just one emotion - sadness/emptiness etc. With BPD, you may experience sadness/emptiness, but that is just one emotion. With BPD, your constantly going through an array of different emotions. From sadness, to anger, to fear, to okay again, intense fear again etc. With BPD, you spend your life going through fluctuating emotions rather than with depression, it's more just like one emotion. When I got diagnosed with BPD, one of the main things my doctor used to make the decision was how my moods and emotions would change and differ so quickly. What is your pattern of emotion like?"

BPD,fp3is0q,t1_fp3i1jj,1588280026.0,"Well, it's most likely a little bit of both. Whilst the emotion you feel could be rational, it's the reaction that isn't. A person without disorder would probably cry for a few days but then accept they have to move on and find ways to be happy. I think a lot us with bpd like to stew and sit on our pain either because we think we deserve it or to validate our reaction. We seem to love a bit of self-destruction. I think a lot of unconscious beliefs also go into it. You may be upset because he left but the reason you could be so upset is because him leaving triggered feelings that everyone will leave and you will always be alone. If you separate him from those feelings, it will be easier to move on."
BPD,fp3h0sr,t3_gb0l54,1588279155.0,"I dealt with cutting for a long time and the only thing that helped me stop was finding a big enough consequence of it to stop. For me, it was being forced into psychiatric inpatient. It was such a traumatizing experience that I never cut again so they never had a physical reason/proof to send me back. With no proof of mental illness, you almost gain a sense of control over your life. Of course, I have lots of scars but with no new marks there's nothing anybody can do but believe what I tell them.  When I get triggered to cut these days, I find what helps is talking and telling everyone you feel comfortable with about it. Tell them you want to cut and you don't know how to stop. Talk to them. Listen to them. Get lost in conversation. Someone will stay until you push past the urge. As for the disorder, you just have to accept it, work hard in therapy and believe that you can get better and live a fulfilling life. It's all we can do. Giving up and accepting defeat will never lead to any success."

Option1: [https://i.imgur.com/yN5DXiX.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/yN5DXiX.jpg)

Our dog Emma was an american eskimo we got in America. We moved to the UK when she was a puppy and she had to be in quarantine for almost a year due to regulations. It was horrible and she got cancer as a result from the stress. They told us she'd be lucky to live  another year, she made it to 9! She was always there for me, by my bed, when I was sick, when I was sad, always. She was the best pupper. She died on Christmas eve many years ago and now we put a little white wolf toy on the top of our tree instead of a star.

Our cat was called Mau Mau, named by my brother because we found her under my parents car, we searched for hours before we found her because all we could hear was this meowing sound coming from somewhere. It turned out she used to belong to an abusive owner, so we took her in and later found out she was pregnant with kitties! She was my mums best friend as well as Emma's and died a few years after her.

If the photo quality is too bad let me know and I have some photos of just our cat by herself that might be better!

Bonus

If none of those work or you just have an extra spot i'd love one for myself of by boy stuart. I adopted him as an emotional support animal after he was returned to the pet store and I wasn't in such a good place. He was a very good boyo, loved to cuddle and always strangely looked more like a mouse than a hamster.

BPD,fnxqtev,t3_g4hl8e,1587344408.0,"Breaking any boundary set by someone in a relationship is cheating. Whether it is something emotional or sexual. If you tell him you aren't comfortable with it and you consider it cheating, he shouldn't be doing it. To some people it might not be cheating but that is your personal relationship boundary and it is okay to have a different view to someone else. It doesn't matter if he doesn't consider it cheating, you do, he should respect that. You are more important than tipping some cam girl on a site. If he respects you he will respect your boundaries. You can't change the past but you can change the future.

I know it's hard but sometimes you need to be the bigger person when we can't be. Saying something like 'I'm sorry I didn't mean to offend you, but I really want to watch something with you, lets pick one of our favourites' might be better, then when he's calmer bring up later that you have a right to an opinion and he shouldn't have overreacted.  But from his point of view, he's asked to watch something with you and you've said basically you don't want to and implied he watches it alone. I'd feel really rejected even though it's not about me, it's about the show. He's probably just overacting about your dislike for the show because it feels like your rejecting him not the show.

I can't help but feel personally attacked and like they are trying to hurt me on every level. I completely shut down and can't acknowledge what i've done. It's so unhealthy but I can't help how bad it makes me feel :( I hate being 'in trouble' it always makes me feel like just another thing they hate about me. Then the more im 'in trouble' the more I resent them for making me feel so bad even though I made them feel bad originally. I'm a messsssss.

Random_Acts_Of_Pizza,fn50p9d,t3_fzcqnn,1586653189.0,"I don't know if this is funny or just sad but when I was 15, I went to a party and drank a LOT. Someone had bought store-brand vodka and nobody would drink it because it tasted like absolute ass. Me like the true champ I am, did not want it to go to waste so I drank all the bottles by myself. Yes, you heard me, bottles. Multiple bottles. Everything else I remember is just flashes really, with my next memory being waking up in hospital after having my heart resuscitated and my stomach pumped. I was still kind of out of it and kept screaming at the nurses because they had had to cut me out of my outfit incase I had any broken bones. I had just bought the outfit the day before for the party and it is safe to say I was pissed. Both the drunk kind of pissed and the angry kind. Funny how I was more worried about my outfit then my liver. The doctors think I may have also been spiked with ketamine but who knows. I didn't let it get me down and the next day I discharged myself from the hospital and forced my mum to let me go on my geography class hiking trip the next day. Nobody at school ever really brought it up (to my relief) but it was safe to say I was no longer the perfect party invitee! Years later I may have blacked out and fallen drunk through a double-pane glass shower at a house party. It was shattered into pieces but luckily I left with barley a scratch. Although I did have to go to the hospital and have hundreds of tiny shards tweezed out of my skin. I may or may not have the pics to prove it. Safe to say I no longer drink that much. You live and you learn!"

KindVoice,fmutl0s,t3_fxgknc,1586398587.0,"Hey, I hope you are doing okay. Have you considered your husband may be dealing with some underlying or undiagnosed mental health issues? Perhaps he may have been triggered by a small trauma or just a build up of things over time you may not have ever noticed or known about. I suffer with anxiety, depression and bpd and I'm ashamed to say I have acted like your husband has with people I have been completely in love with. I told them every little thing they did annoyed me, I called them names and i'd also scream at them when they asked for a hug or any sign of affection. It's crazy to read because I feel like I was the exact same person as he was. It took me a long time to break out of it and realise what I was doing. I was hurting so much and I took it out on them. I am not presuming anything, but it is worth considering he might be dealing with something similar. People don't usually just turn on you for no reason and sometimes it is beyond their control. Maybe try to talk to him when he's calm, don't attack him about it, just tell him how much you miss him and how things used to be, ask if there is anything wrong that you can help with, try to get him to open up. The good thing is that if there is something going on, he can get help, and you can get your husband back."

KindVoice,fmuhdni,t3_fx9v4o,1586391444.0,"As someone who is used to pushing people away due to health reasons. I say don't fool for it. The more we push you away, the more we need you to push back. Don't give up or stop trying. I agree with the other post that you should be direct about it. Tell him you still love him and want to support him. You understand the difficulty of how hard things are and will be but you are there for them no matter what. I'd tell him that if he doesn't love you or want to be romantically involved with you anymore that is okay, but you still love him and are going to support him no matter what. Let him know that your life is better with him in it, wether it be romantic or friendship. It's your decision that matters about what makes your life better. Nobody else's. Good luck, I hope things work out. Praying for you both."
