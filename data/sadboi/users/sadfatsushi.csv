jobs,fpkabb5,t3_gdwug7,1588691002.0,"Holy shit are you me? Just want to say that you're not alone on this and that you're lucky you have a mentor.  I am working from home since mid March, and I have been MIA a lot of times ever since (just worked when I wanted to) so I was given a memo recently. I replied to it with a resignation letter and then my boss (who owns the company) called me so we can talk it out. I told her that I am depressed and I'm disconnected with the job. I gave her a very limited answer, anything that I think she'll only care about as an employer cos I just don't want to be fully vulnerable to my employer. I still want to have boundaries.

Similar to you, I was offered a new path in the company by my boss, and I was torn between trying my luck in that position (+enduring the job, because of the uncertainty of this pandemic) and listening to my guts to just quit because I just lost my care anymore and it's affecting my mental health. I'm appreciative of the fact that she wants to see me succeed, however I don't see a bright future with the company, because of the lack of structure, and lack of strong management with the projects (I work in IT). To support that claim, they're rated only 1 and 2 stars by their previous employees at Glassdoor. But we can all agree on one thing, it's a good learning place for us. Cos no one's micromanaging you and you wear many hats (meaning you can learn more skills), also because it's a small company.

As of the moment, I still haven't told her my decision on whether to retract my resignation or just go on with it. I'm just kind of finishing my pending tasks rn. My mind is still clouded. For the past year and a half, I have been just riding it out. And I have a bad feeling I would do the same even I shift to doing the position she was offering. My attendance has long been bad enough already. And I just don't want to be a bigger liability very soon. I want to take a long break, or just take a dead-end repetitive job for the meantime just to pay the bills (and then do my personal projects on the side).

I'm subscribing to this post so I can see more reasonable opinions. Good luck to us, we got this ðŸ–¤"

SuicideWatch,fnwhssm,t3_g48v49,1587318634.0,"Baby, I was on the same boat when I was 16 and in my first year of college. My dad threatened me that if I failed even just one subject, he's gonna stop financially supporting me and make me work as a maid for another family, and so he could get rid of me in the house. I failed a math subject and I was extremely mortified to tell my parents. I told my mom about it, and she was more understanding of my situation. My grades for all the other subjects were good. He didn't do anything. I retook the subject and they paid for my tuition fee.

Came 4th year, right when I was about to graduate college, I failed another one, which meant my graduation will be delayed. Again, I was mortified to tell them. So I just told my sister, and eventually my parents learned about the graduation delay from her. My parents didn't say anything. And seeing how I felt, they actually comforted me instead (I looked like shit for being so stressed out at school). I retook that subject and graduated later that same year.

The threats of my dad were nothing but empty words that he thought would motivate me to do better. It didn't make my performance at school better. It just freaked me out. I only did better when they motivated me.

Now, I'm not sure how bad your situation is with your dad. But I believe there's some trauma there that needs to be addressed. You know your dad the most. If he's only acting like this when it comes to school shit, try to talk to him about what you truly feel about these threats, including these suicidal thoughts. No parents in their right minds would judge you and even scold you for having these feelings. If he reacted violently when you open up to him, it's time to call any other relatives or teachers you can trust. Open up to the older people who can connect you to a health professional (or a police if ever your dad resorts to violence again). Dude, at your age, you're still considered a child. Your safety should be your parents' priority more than anything else."

findapath,fmmwd6e,t1_fmmjqc0,1586213346.0,"This is so true. I'm between INTJ-INFJ. I currently work in IT as a graphic/web designer - this was my dream job right before I graduated college, and before working odd jobs (I thought my job right now was a pragmatic choice to combine my passion in arts and my analytical thinking skills). I do fairly good at it, but I swear every end of the day, and every weekend, I'm just tired and unhappy. It just felt like a chore, cos I didn't care too much about the company or the clients' businesses, compared to helping people in need directly. I thought money would motivate me, but it didn't. Sitting on my ass 10 hours a day is just killing me a little day by day. Maybe a desk job is not for me. For now, I just feel I would be happier in a job that I would find more fulfilling, and I have always considered social work and nursing. Seeing the global crisis now, it all just makes sense to me. I strongly feel transitioning, I'm just planning a smart move to do so."
findapath,fmmt4ul,t3_fw4tsy,1586211575.0,"I have 3 questions:-Can you specify which courses you took in college?-What are the art and science careers are you eyeing for?-And what jobs have you had so far, if any?

Reading what you've posted, you kind of sounded like myself so I'm giving you my suggestions, based on my regrets lol. It looks like you're getting inside your head too much, and I think you have to just figure out first what your heart wants - what is it that you just find yourself normally doing when you're not studying? What is it that you spend most of your time (and all your life) thinking about? I doubt that's equally art and science. There's got to be one that weighs more. Follow it. Start with that. Go back to community college and focus on that, while still making time for your other passions. If you can get a job before / while in college (preferably a job related to the course you're studying), try to do that. One of my regrets is not trying a real-life job first when I could have done that during college (or after high school, before deciding which bachelor's to take), so I would have had more confidence, and a clearer vision when I graduated.

To sum it up, let your heart decide which college course feels right to you at this moment, finish that first, so you can open doors to more opportunities afterwards. I think you're being too anxious about the future, and you shouldn't have to be. Your happiness (and own sanity lol) is the most important. There is no shame in switching jobs to determine what works for you and what does not. I think the key is to adjust your focus. If you really want something, you'll make time for it. If you see yourself switching between a lot of jobs in the future, I suggest to save up HARD before you land a next job. So when it's time to make a transition, you're ready.

If I had one biggest regret in my life, that is having the answers right in front of me, but still looked elsewhere for validation.

depression,fmfer8e,t3_fuxf3y,1586025717.0,"I think you need to work on your self-confidence first. From the words of RuPaul, ""If you can't love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else?"" I suggest to focus on yourself first, identify your passions, interests and talents, and find other people in your area who do the same and build connections with them. In that way, you can practice your interpersonal/conversational skills, without feeling forced, because you'd be talking about the things you love/good at. Studies also show that if you talk about things you're passionate about, the more attractive you are to the other person. So who knows, maybe someone else will notice you, while you're at it.

Also, from what you said, your crush and her friends seem like nasty bitches anyway. Sorry not sorry. You wouldn't want that, I'm telling you lol. So chin up, divert your focus to yourself, and take your time. It's okay to feel this way, but don't ever forget that you deserve love from yourself too. Slowly build your confidence, and eventually you'll realize that there are indeed plenty of fish in the sea."
depression,fmf2b25,t1_fmejboa,1586018507.0,"I feel the same way. I grew up in a very religious family, and as a kid I would be questioning so many things. If I question something about the bible or the church, my parents would respond that I need to just listen to the church heads because they know better, and that we should all be united by adhering (BLIND.LY) with the church at all times. Because it's ""God's words"". I always find that ridiculous when I was younger because I thought why give me a brain that thinks freely if all God ever wanted me to do was never question his words and follow it all the time. Is thinking freely the devil's work? It's just all ridiculous to me. I never know of anyone to open up to about these thoughts, because unfortunately I grew up being surrounded by close-minded people, and people who take so much pride of their positions in their  companies where they slave their asses away (who just dismiss depressing thoughts and call it merely a mindset). It's tough, it's hard being agnostic and rational in a country that's highly Christian. Cos they just shove it in your face that you don't believe enough, that's why you're depressed.

Despite all these, there are still beautiful things to enjoy in life. I love my pets, my dogs, they give me joy and unconditional love. Or the flowers. And walking in the rain. Chocolates. I love these things, so I'm still here, somehow. Sending you virtual hugs, Melissa ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤ðŸ–¤"
depression,fmeznzx,t1_fme9wp4,1586016965.0,"Omg guys, I've never felt so understood. I'm not very articulate either, so thank you OP for posting this. Like you guys, I never believed I am sick. My boss even offered me to see a psychologist which she'll pay for, but I had to decline because I don't believe I'm a ""broken person that needs fixing"". Deep inside, I just really want to get out of this system as soon as possible, but too bad I can't afford to do it anytime soon, cos I'm just poor af. And I don't personally know of anyone I can open up to about this, seeing how my family and my society would simply label people lazy, just because some people find traditional stuff ridiculous and don't want to be sheeples. Sometimes I wish I was one of many people who can just live life on auto-pilot, so I won't have to suffer this much, being aware about these things and knowing I am so small to do anything that significant to change this stupid system. But then I think to myself, if I became a sheeple instead, then that's not me in the first place, and I wouldn't have existed. And I think not existing at all is better than becoming a sheeple. This is why I'm suicidal. My only hope for living is to be there for my family, loved ones and support other people who go through this."

MoneyDiariesACTIVE,flkfwhi,t3_fjlm6i,1585240160.0,"Hi, I feel the same. I hate my job which I have for more than a year now, and months ago I realized that I would need to shift to a different career which would offer me work and life balance (I want to have the time and energy for my personal creative projects). It sucks because by the end of 2019, I was supposed to be resigning. But my low self-esteem indecisive ass held me back from doing so, until we have this pandemic.

I'm not happy with my job because everyday it feels like a chore, plus the painfully low salary. I live in a city where there's terrible traffic, which consumes a huge chunk of my everyday life, so I don't really have the time and energy to do what I love outside of work. The company is quite shit too, due to the lack of solid processes.

When I learned that my company decided to go with a work from home setup during the lockdown, I was quite looking forward that it might somehow lessen my internal misery. But no, still the same feeling of dragging your ass off everyday to work, and just faking it, and find myself daydreaming instead, about the things I could be doing right now.

At this moment, I just really want to end this internal misery. I just really want peace of mind. Luckily I have quite some savings, so I'm not really worried about going broke any time soon. It's the struggle that I have to face with every day, and I feel like pulling my hair to shreds. I don't have lots of sabbaticals either. 7 days for the entire year - that's it.  


Btw, please let me know how it goes. Earlier today, I was really decided on quitting my job tomorrow. But then I thought of posting on r/AskReddit and all their responses were about letting this pandemic pass first. I might give it a second thought, just for now. Good luck and take care :)"
