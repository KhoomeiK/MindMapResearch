I'm glad to see just normal adjusting, no over saturating, or clarity slider Set to max.   
I personally just want it as natural as possible, but to each and his own.   
As far as artistic/hobbyist photography goes, everyone has its own vision, none is really wrong.  

Keep shooting RAW, it might be annoying with the space, but you really need it. RAW files hold in so much data. I did some tests with my oldest DSLR (Canon 30D), even if the processing resulted in bad noise i could've extracted alot of data from it, with JPG you don't even have half of that data."

ExperienteCulinare,fpopkdy,t3_gep5gc,1588788461.0,"Ok, cateva chestii inainte de toate, nu sunt chef profesionist, gatesc in mare parte pentru mine doar (si uneori pentru familie si prieteni cand e cazul, mereu primesc complimente desi habar nu am ce dracu fac, practic).  
Personal, cand gatesc pentru mine, imi place mancarea mai arsa, si cu o tona de sare, si in general nu prea masor cat pun si ce pun, ma iau dupa instinct/logica (dupa cum am zis, nu fac asta profesional).     

Ma descurc de fel bine cu mancarea in stil asiatic, poza din postare este cu Pui cu Ciuperci.   

Ingrediente:   
~ 500g de pui     
~ 1 ardei gras verde    
~ 5 ciuperci (normale, albe, champignon sau brune)    
~ O ceapa verde (un fir, nu o legatura)   
~ Un sfert de ceapa normala (desi, probabil nu are rost sa va bateti capul, eu personal mai experimentez)   
~ Alune sarate fara coaja   

Pe langa ingredientele de baza, am folosit:   

~ Pasta de curry   
~ Sare, piper  
~ Curcuma (turmeric)   
~ Sos de Soia    

Alunele sunt optionale, fiind o reteta usor adjustabila si care se potriveste cu multe ingrediente, cu acestea am preparat-o doar in ultimele dati.  
Puteti sa folositi unt, ulei de wok sau ulei normal de floarea soarelui (am incercat in toate trei, personal cam prefer uleiul de wok, adauga putina aroma de usturoi).   

Ordinea mea de adaugare a ingredientelor:  

1. Ceapa/cepele + sare   
2. Ardeiul gras + sare   
3. Puiul + sare  
4. Ciupercile  
5. Pasta de curry (adaugata mai spre final, dar nu in ultimul moment deoarece dureaza pana se lichefiaza si poate fi omogenizata cu ingredientele)   
6. Sare, piper si curcuma.   
7. Sos de soia (nu il ""prajiti"" mai mult de cca. 1 minut)   

Nimic foarte special, am zis sa contribui si eu cu ceva fiind un sub-reddit nou.   

Puteti sa adaugati mai multe ingrediente dupa plac/posibilitati (cu morcov merge foarte bine, insa trebuie adaugat mai pe la inceput.   

In rest cam atat, personal e una dintre chestile mele preferate."

AskPhotography,fpf4kxe,t1_fpeunhy,1588561639.0,"Hey there.   

If a lens has only one aperture in the title, it means that if it's a zoom (telephoto) lens, it will have a constant aperture throughout the range.   

50mm is a prime lens, maximum aperture is f1.8, but it can go as low as f16 (or so).   

Telephoto lenses typically have a ranging aperture, so that's why you sometimes see them as let's say f2.8-f4.5, because the more you zoom the more apertures you're losing.   

There are telephoto lenses that have a constant aperture throughout their focal range, but they're a bit more expensive.   

So, no, if it has only one aperture in the title it doesn't mean it's the only aperture you can use.   

I hope you understood this wall of text, English isn't my native language and i also lack some dozens of hours of sleep.

Do it to your tastes, your tastes will evolve in the future anyway.   
Commercial photography has standards indeed, but artistic photography in my opinion must be whatever the photographer loves to capture.    
It's his/her own vision, right?   

Next lens I suggest you would be a 50mm f1.8, it's in that lower budget spectrum.   
And if you don't mind fiddling with manual focus you can get some really nice M42 lenses and an adapter (You can find those lenses in flea markets, thrift stores, online for few bucks, and some are really good)"
