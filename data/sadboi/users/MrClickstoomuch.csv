Motors,fq30ged,t1_fq20k2t,1589061874.0,"Thabks for the help! I think I've found a close enough solution for if I don't rotate the motor at least. Running it through the rotation script to double check and it turns out the starting point is +0.02 Nm while rotating it now actually gets me much higher torque numbers like between -0.05Nm to +0.86Nm. And the +0.86Nm torque is just 0.6Â° from the point where I had -0.05Nm.

If I never rotate my motor my cogging torque is fine. My flux linkage looks to be the exact same shape as the LRK motor example (just with a different starting point) with peaks at +/-0.0078.

I had a 2 part problem:

1. 

I had my material air set for 3""+ out from my motor, but never set up a separate boundary property to define the edge toward infinity. Using the onion method you linked still had the high cogging torque by itself.

2. 

My windings I generated with a script had 0 space for the same air material to define the outside of the rotor and inside of the motor. I added a separate air condition at the center of the motor to resolve this originally. However, I didn't have any onion boundary condition on the inside of the motor (may be worthwhile as I have a ton of elements just of air in the center of the motor). My understanding is if I did the onion method on the inside of the motor is that I'd need to reverse the mux and muy permability layering such that it increases toward motor center.

Adding a small gap between slots (I'm using distributed windings) connected the inside and outside air regions. I think this had no inner boundary condition and that was another part of my issue."
Motors,fq1x7vo,t1_fq148p3,1589050697.0,"Yep. I'm using a script to get the blockintegral 22 (the weighted stress tensor torque) of the entire group which includes the inner and outer rotor rings. I'm rotating the rotor ring 15 degrees total if I recal right.

I double checked last night that I had no current in circuit A, B, or C.

My boundary condition is a large square around my motor with the air material. I'll check out the boundary condition you mentioned because I don't recall any boundary condition setup other than that.

I am simulating the whole motor so it has a lot of elements (100,000 nodes) but I can run each sim in about 10-15s so it isn't prohibitively time consuming. Still, if I could be more accurate and reduce run time together that would be great."
Motors,fpykxqy,t1_fnzokdt,1589005613.0,"Took me a while to get back to this because I was looking into my model and hand calcs to see if I can figure out some additional errors. I used a Lorentz Force method. I think I found a large part of the discrepancy between my hand calcs and the model though.

First I needed to determine the flux that influences the windings per pole. I used an estimate of peak magnetic flux from a pdf I found from Shane Coulton that provides a very simplified motor design process. The peak magnetic field is approximately equal to the remanent flux density (Br) multiplied by the magnet thickness (t) divided by t plus the distance to the air gap center (g).

I'm using N52 magnets so Br was 1.3, t=0.25"", and the distance to center of the windings 1/8"" (3mm). This gave me B as 0.93T peak. The big problem with my math from here on out was I didn't consider that this was the *peak*, not average field at my windings. In FEMM this was closer to 0.55 for a 40% drop. I assumed it would be lower by 10% but forgot how thin my magnets were. I had much less difference with peak and average flux using half-inch thick magnets.

Then, I can use a lorentz force calculation based on the number of active lengths of wire I'm using (N), the current (I), the magnetic field (B), the length of active wire L (wire length perpendicular to the flux, using a cross product), and radius at the center of the winding (R). I assumed a length of 1"" (to equal my magnet length), a radius of 4.5"", magnetic field B of 0.93 (known wrong now), 1A current, and N as the total windings in the motor 180. This gives me 0.5 Nm/A for the entire motor. If I reduce it 40%, then also consider my flux was reduced another 0.05T when I implemented it in the motor, this is pretty close to the 0.24Nm at 1A. My litz wire strands were considered as 1 wire total for all strands combined. If I had considered my halbach motor spreads the flux over a wider area it would have been a much closer estimate.

I'm still a bit stuck on the motor though because my cogging torque is not very sinusoidal. Compared to the LRK motor tutorial for FEMM mine is all over the place. I might need to make a much smaller version of the motor first to check if my math and simulations make sense.

Edit: just realized cogging torque is from the steel/iron in the stator. Why would I even be getting cogging torque in an ironless stator in FEMM? I am using the move rotate command on my entire inner and outer rotor groups together, so differences between the angles shouldn't even happen."

Here's how I'd do it since you are pulling from multiple sheets:

Filename = uigetfile; % can add additional details like file filters, etc.

Sheetnames = {list of sheetnames to reference};

For ii=1:length(Sheetnames)

      C{ii} = xlsread(Filename, Sheetnames{ii}, 'E:E');

end

The output should be a cell array inside C, so if you had two sheets, one of 100 rows and the other of 70 rows:

C = {100x1 cell array, 70x1 cell array}.

Note: can also replace the length in the for loop with 10 but this allows it to automatically pull in the right number of sheet information. You could also organize by sheetname as well if you assigned to a structure instead of a cell.

Hope that helps!"
smarthome,fgul8lt,t3_f05zge,1581123603.0,"I have mine set up essentially like this (and also to turn on an outdoor light when I arrive + turn it off shortly afterwards).

I originally tried lifx mini white during a black friday sale but was disappointed that it only had the one type of white light (I personally like the cool white color best) but it works seamlessly after setup.

I got some feit smart bulbs from costco and HIGHLY do not recommend them from my experience. I got 4 bulbs in november and have had non-stop connection issues. Setup was much wirse than lifx. 1 bulb now never connects to wifi (likely broken now which means a return). The other lights require me to turn on/off my switch every other day to get network connection again. Not great when the lifx ones on the same switch don't have the same issues.

The big pros of the feit is the cheap prices and color changing (from a variety of whites to colors). If you are ok with the hassles feit might work ok for you if you buy 2x more than you need and replace the duds."

technology,fe3e3ue,t1_fe253fv,1578848430.0,"I'm pro-GMO in general, but golden rice in particular appears to be overhyped. The beta-carotene that they are adding to get vitamin A degrades 60% after 3 weeks from harvest and 90% after 10 weeks. Keep in mind it takes time for the rice to get from harvest to table.

FDA finds it has no significant nutritional benefit, with golden rice having 0.5-2.3 ug/g of beta-carotene (carrots have 13.8 to 49.3 ug/g for comparison).

No human safety or efficacy studies have been performed.

These problems can be resolved (there may be ways to reduce the degradation problem as it currently occurs with a oxygen reaction, nutritional benefit can go up as they reduce the massive variability) but I'm unsure if the benefit is there enough to justify the likely increased cost of this rice over a normal rice. This also doesn't get into the standard concerns with GMOs.

I have balding / thinning hair on the top of my head and started using the liquid. I had a fine hairline. The liquid is slightly more effective than the foam but barely better.

My problem was the liquid in the recommended dose would move as I tilted/turned my head, spreading it unevenly across my head. Since minoxil increases shedding / kills thinning hairs it made my hairline worse as I wasn't consistently using it on my forehead. Top of my head improved but my hairline is worse. 

Now I'm using the foam on both to better control where it goes. Just wish I did it from the beginning."

It talks about how much investments you need to retire early (including inflation). A person would need to withdrawl an inflation-adjusted 4% or less of their investments to be 'financially independent' - that is, have 25x their salary in investments, to retire.

There is another subreddit called r/leanfire that discusses retiring early on a lower income as well.

CPU: Ryzen 1800x
GPU: Vega 56
Hard drives: 1 tb 7200 rpm, a 256 ssd, and a 120gb ssd. Also purchased a 1 tb nvme ssd to use as a replacement OS boot drive.
OS: Windows 10

Either way, an electric car would be good enough for my daily commute and even to drive to my parent's place. The big problem with electric adoption in the US is lack of charging spots. My problem is my parents don't have an EV charger so I wouldn't be able to do the round trip. And google only shows level 2 stations out of the way about 30 mins (about a 80 mile drive).
