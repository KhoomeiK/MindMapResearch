There is some ""??"" from my childhood that i don't recall and i don't know why i can't remember.

I never had a dramatic trauma event/experience as far as i can remember.

Finding a suitable therapist is harder than i thought. Perhaps I'm over thinking every therapist I come across online. Maybe I'm just subconsciously avoiding it.

She pretended that they were out of stock, the pack I wanted, although I saw the cigarettes in the draw while she was ""looking"" for them. Second incident, buying alcohol, same story. But after bending and inspecting my ID card, staff member reluctantly gave me the alcohol. Didn't even ask for a second form of ID.

This is the less details version of events. Basically, staff members made me feel really uncomfortable while I was shopping.

I also get really bad social anxiety anyway, this just made me feel so distressed. Never buying alcohol or cigarettes here again. Even if it is cheaper."

limerence,fionudb,t1_fiolqnm,1582586918.0,"I like the concept of that rule. When I am with my SO, the intrusive thoughts of LO majorly decrease. Other than the odd though or two every now and then. But the obsessive thoughts are increased when I am alone and not with my SO.

Well one of my ""recent"" encounters with LO was back in September. It was the second week of College so I had to take an earlier bus than I usually did for high school. Next thing I know LO walks up the the bus stop and my mind starts to race. I couldnt stop moving/pacing around the place. The sense of euphoria went through the roof. I glanced at LO very briefly, LO gave a quick, small smile and I reciprocated.

Basically ever since that moment, I got up in the mornings to dress well just in case I saw LO again. Put on perfume to smell good. I wanted to make sure I looked presentable. LO is a year below me in education level, so is still attending high school. There are two local bus routes that go into the City, where I attend college and LO goes to school.

Ever since then I have gotten up earlier to make the early bus that LO could possibly be on. Just waiting, hoping that LO gets on the bus. Maybe LO might have to sit next to me because the bus is full.

This behaviour continued until the Halloween break. I just kinda gave up and now it doesn't bother me as much if I'm on the same bus as LO. It was crazy really cause realistically, the chances of that happening were very unlikely. I knew that. LO could be using another form of transport to school. It was probably just a coincidence that morning. A once off. I was just hanging on to the ""what if""."
limerence,fiolvmt,t1_fiojr1j,1582585792.0,"Didn't think of it that way, thanks. I have LO either blocked or unfriended on all social media platforms except one, Twitter. Although it is very tempting to send friend requests to LO. When my limerence is at a high point I resist. Especially considering when the limerence has subsided I unfriend LO again. I think it just comes across as creepy. Sending friend requests, then unfriending, friend requests again a few months later etc.

When obsessive thoughts come, I do look at LO's social media and the clubs websites that she participates in. I look at what can be seen by the public.

When I do this, I do kind of feel like I am betraying my SO in a way. I feel guilty after looking at pictures of LO."

Although growing up, my parents have always encourage me to celebrate the Chinese New Year and all but it just never felt right to me. When I was a kid I would go around my school and read some background history about the Chinese New Year (Googled it all). I also used to be apart of this small group with other adoptees where basic Chinese, (eg. counting, days of the week etc) was being taught to us. This occurred when I was a young kid too. I didn't have much interest in any of it tbh. It just felt ""off"" to me for some unknown reason.

As a kid I learnt how play the violin which I did have an interest in but.
1. Me being a young kid, I thought it was a traditional Irish instrument so for me it just didn't feel right for me to be learning how to play the violin. So I quit. I just didn't feel like it was right because I'm not Irish blooded.
2. I am now an adult and have realised that the violin is actually an ""Asian instrument"". (I'm being stereotypical here, don't mean to be offensive in anyway). With this new realisation I feel like its ""less wrong"" of me to play the violin and I wish I kept it up now.

Apologies if I've gone off topic in a bit of a side rant

These things, amongst others, left me feeling quite conflicted between two cultures. I was raised in a different culture as opposed to my birth countrys culture and I'm okay with that. I just wish other people would stop being so presumptuous about what I ""should know/do"" because I was born in China. OP I understand how you feel. Sometimes I do feel as though I am ""betraying"" my could've been culture."
