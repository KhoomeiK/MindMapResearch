It’s so insulting. I have issues with pelvic and vaginal pain. I also have a mirena. My OBGYN ordered a full abdominal ultrasound to investigate; she didn’t blame my IUD, and she didn’t blame the fibromyalgia. In the end, I had a completely normal ultrasound. So she now does think it’s just another part of my lovely fibromyalgia symptoms. I can’t believe the attitude we get from some doctors.

My reason is that you edit to say you were a stay at home dad before now, and that your current work schedule is “at least as demanding” as taking care of the kids. But unlike your wife, you were not growing an entire human in your body while taking care of those kids. Pregnancy is exhausting. I was extremely fatigued in the earliest months of pregnancy, I’ve never been so tired in my life. And I was a single person, with no kids to take care of! She is 100% doing more work than you. You are refusing to recognize her pregnancy as hard, physical work.

Also, your wife did not say you can never take a nap after work. She just asked if you need to every day. You need to compromise on this. Help her on the hardest days, and nap on the other days."
rheumatoid,fqyqs6n,t3_glnkag,1589753009.0,"I’ve been on Humira for over a year now. I highly recommend it, it’s been great for me. I used to take 1 shot every other week. Now I take one every week. I’ve had almost no side effects, and a ton of benefits. It manages my arthritis pain, swelling, and stiffness really well. The only side effect I experience is also the most common side effect: a bit of an injection site reaction. I have some minor redness, itchiness, and swelling around the injection area for a day or two after the shot. I didn’t start having this side effect until I’d been taking the medicine for a while. It’s also very easy to manage the symptoms with benadryl, and using an ice pack directly after my shot. It’s well worth this minor annoyance to feel so much healthier!

I also take methotrexate, so I’m on 2 immunosuppressants. But with RA, our immune system is disordered already. My complaints when I get sick are the same as before I started these meds. I seem to stay sick for longer than most people, my immune system can take a week (or a few weeks) to fight something off. I honestly get sick less often now, because I’m more cautious and hyperaware of germs. I only catch a cold about once per year, it used to be 2 or more. I’ve never had a fever since I started RA meds. I was told to prepare to get sick more being immune suppressed, so it was a pleasant surprise to get sick less!"

Fibromyalgia,fqutyis,t3_gkxu14,1589664531.0,"Brain scans of patients with fibromyalgia have been studied, they show neuro inflammation. But that is very different than other types of inflammation, and would most likely not be treated by anti inflammatory medications. If neuro inflammation is backed up by more studies, medications for fibro would become more similar to those used in auto immune diseases, but targeted towards nervous system inflammation. 

There is a lot of debate about whether 
fibromyalgia is neurological, auto immune, or both. Currently it’s not classified as auto immune, but it’s being studied further all the time. Fibromyalgia has a lot less research than other diseases, it’s only been recognized by the American Medical Association since 1987. so it will be a long time before we have complete answers about what it is and how best to treat it.

Then it turned out, all of those doctors neglected to test me for ccp antibodies. I tested positive, then I tested ANA positive (I was previously negative for ANA for years, many retests). They confirmed it was RA with ultrasounds. Over a third of RA patients can be seronegative. 

I guarantee many seronegative people with RA, AS, and PsA are diagnosed with only fibromyalgia. You see it all the time in the arthritis subreddits. People need to get ultrasounds or MRIs to definitively rule out inflammatory arthritis. There is a ton of misinformation out there, and doctors who don’t do enough testing! People think inflammation is linked to fibro, or that joint swelling is common with it. Neither should be true. But some doctors do not believe in seronegative arthritis, or test further for it, unfortunately. In general, fibromyalgia has a ton of common comorbidities, so it’s always good to keep searching if you have symptoms that don’t quite fit fibro alone."

I’m in the process of trying to qualify for my state’s medicaid based on chronic illness. I have to gather my medical records, fill out the application, meet with a social worker, then have an evaluation to declare me chronically ill. It’s a lot of work, but definitely worth the effort.

If you don’t qualify for medicaid, you may have missed the window to get on private health insurance through the online marketplace. In my state, they extended the deadline to April 15th, but that was the cut off. However, since this is your first year off your parent’s insurance, that cutoff might not apply to you.

All I had to do was fill out an online application, submit medical records, and do a video chat interview. It might be a shorter wait than your next rheumatology visit to tide you over.

Another idea is asking your primary care for a physical therapy referral at your upcoming appointment.

That is considered a pretty quick diagnosis for fibro, many people I speak to had a much harder time getting diagnosed. I did many in-person examinations with primary care doctor, several rounds of blood work, a brain MRI, and a sleep study (both overnight and daytime studies), then diagnosed by rheumatologist at first visit. I do not think it’s realistic to expect a diagnosis to be correct with only one doctor visit and one round of blood work. Getting answers is not a quick or easy process, there is a lot of tests, re-tests, and waiting for results. Especially if you want to be sure you have the correct diagnosis. I think it’s very likely that you won’t be able to get enough testing done to get a diagnosis without going back to a state that takes your insurance. I hope you can at least get some medication to make this time more bearable.

I lived with a fibromyalgia diagnosis for over 2 years before learning that I had an incomplete diagnosis. I have rheumatoid arthritis, which went undiagnosed for 8 years. Like you, my primary symptom has always been knee pain. I’ve had other odd symptoms like rashes. All of this was the RA for me, and only improved when I had a correct diagnosis and RA medications. I had fully normal blood work and fully normal X rays, with almost no visible swelling. Three different rheumatologists told me it was only fibromyalgia. These same doctors never bothered to give me a simple blood test for ccp antibodies. That ended up being my first positive blood test when I finally got a doctor who was thorough.

AmItheAsshole,fpvcze5,t3_gfayo7,1588941913.0,"NTA, but I don’t recommend showing this spreadsheet to your parents. Your parents are abusive and neglectful to all of you. They could escalate the abuse if you confront them about it. I want to spell out for you that this family dynamic is awful. Calling you a useless disappointment is verbal/emotional abuse. Telling two young children with a traumatic background that they are stressful and they want to get away from them? That’s also verbal abuse, and a threat of abandonment. Their actions and words are telling these children that they are unloved and unwanted. This is going to cause major issues for them. They make you raise these children, that is parentification abuse. They are also isolating you from your peers by forcing you to parent children with no notice. Isolation is an abusive control tactic. See this link for reference, it outlines many forms of child abuse. Several apply to your household. https://www.theduluthmodel.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Abuse-of-Children.pdf

They are also neglecting all of you. Parents should never leave young children overnight without adult supervision. If they started leaving you home alone overnight before you were 16, that can be illegal. If they left siblings with you overnight before you were 18, it was most likely illegal since they’re so young. We’re talking about criminal level neglect here. This is serious stuff, it should not be ignored. There is other neglect that I suspect is happening here: you do not mention your parents getting any kind of therapy or help for the children. Young children with behavioral issues can make huge improvements with therapy and a supportive environment. These kids need more help, and it will be much harder to correct anger problems and other behavior after they grow older! The only person who seems to care about their wellbeing is you. And honestly, they deserve to be adopted by someone else. A family who loves them, and gives them a save space where they always feel loved and supported. I’m sure you give them as much love and care as you can, but they need more adult guidance.

The instability caused by your parents abandoning them to go party, or vacation, is likely contributing a lot to the kids’ bad behavior. It’s often a cry for more attention. Please report your parents to Child Protective Services anonymously. I know you’re worried about what could happen to the kids if you report them. Keep in mind, they only re-home kids when things are really bad. They usually try to work with the parents on improving things after investigating, before even considering taking the kids away. Do this before you move out, so that you know things are actually getting better. I really worry about what will happen if you move out without reporting them. I think they’ll neglect the kids even more, possibly leave them home alone with no supervision at all. Please think about these risks and warning signs."

rheumatoid,fpo4aab,t3_gelcr5,1588778112.0,"I’m sorry to hear you’re not feeling well. Over a third of RA patients are seronegative, with fully normal blood work. It’s definitely a possibility that you have arthritis, or some other condition causing this pain. Some doctors don’t believe in seronegative arthritis, or think it’s very unlikely, so they rule it out as a possibility wayyy too early. RA often causes symmetrical joint problems, so the fact that you’re having the same problem on both sides could be a sign, even though it’s happening at different times. I recommend keeping track of how you’re feeling in a journal or your phone. Write down dates, symptoms, symptom severity, and how long it takes for the symptoms to go away. If you have difficulty doing something because of the symptoms (for example, sleeping or opening a jar), write that down too. Try to do this every time you’re not feeling well. Take pictures if you have swelling or other visible symptoms; keep these organized in a separate folder in your phone to show doctors.

Double check to make sure you were tested for ccp antibodies (anti-ccp blood test), and the rheumatoid factor. Both of these tests can indicate RA, but many of us only get a positive result on 1 test. I spent many years in pain, undiagnosed, because no one thought to give me both types of blood tests. ANA is another important test that can indicate auto immune issues. If it seems like you’re still not making progress with your doctor, I’d ask specifically for a referral to rheumatology.

Thritis,fpkqw2k,t3_gdznwu,1588699467.0,"The “side effects” of living with untreated RA are so much worse than any medication side effects! There is a major flaw in this type of thinking. The most severe side effects listed on a medication label could be incredibly rare and unlikely to happen, like 1 in 1000 odds or lower. Meanwhile, the consequences of RA without medication are extremely likely to happen. Medication side effects are often temporary, so they will usually go away after you talk to the doctor and switch medicines. Guess what isn’t temporary? Permanent joint damage, joint deformity (seriously, look at pictures of RA joint deformity), having a higher risk of developing lymphoma, and a higher risk that your RA will attack vital organs (heart, lungs, eyes, etc). This is the path your mom is on right now. Do these really seem less scary than the medication side effects?

I take two “scary” RA drugs, methotrexate and Humira, I have zero side effects. I have no permanent joint damage, and I only have a few RA flare ups per year. The rest of the time, my joints are much better, I have a ton more energy, and I can do most tasks on my own. Imagine if your mom could have days free of joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Does that sound worth the risk of most-likely-temporary discomfort from side effects? To me, it is, especially considering the risks of unchecked RA. I would be always uncomfortable from my disease anyways, so most medication issues I’ve experienced seem minor in comparison.

Does she know that it’s possible to have remission from RA for months or years? Taking medicine now could give her a chance at a medication free future, without risking permanent damage! Again, I think that’s worth the risk of medication side effects. She needs to look at the facts. What percentage of people actually experience the side effects she’s worrying about? Are the side effects permanent, or do they go away if you stop taking the medicine? How many people have positive experiences with these medicines compared to the percentage of side effects?

I just want to add that if you see a doctor and your X rays or blood work are normal, it doesn’t mean that nothing is wrong. Inflammatory arthritis and other issues do not always show up in X ray or blood tests. Keep looking until you find an explanation for what you’re dealing with. If after a while, you’re not getting answers about what is going on from other tests, try to ask your doctor for an ultrasound or MRI of the painful area. If a doctor isn’t helping you to get answers for what is wrong, try another doctor.

I would start preparing for doctors visits by writing everything down. Make a list of all your symptoms, and questions for the doctor. Keep a symptoms journal. When the pain keeps you up at night, write down the date and time, location of pain, how intense it is/what it feels like, and how long it keeps you from sleeping. It could also be helpful to write notes about what kind of day you’re having when you notice the pain. You might notice a pattern with the pain: is it worse after busy/active days, or inactive days? Is it worse if you have a stressful day? Etc. I hope this helps you, and I wish you luck figuring this out."
AmItheAsshole,fphh90i,t3_gcrdsu,1588621244.0,"NAH. I was shocked at how far I had to scroll down before any replies I agree with showed up in this thread. I have close relationships with some friends and family that would involve cuddling. So many responses here called it “inappropriate” or “gross”, which was surprising. I think it’s pretty sad that so many people keep that much emotional distance in their platonic relationships. It’s fine if people don’t like to cuddle, or cuddle their siblings. But that does not give anyone the right to decide whether it’s “appropriate behavior” for everyone else! Some of us are comfortable expressing platonic love, and it’s a really great thing. 

I think it’s fantastic you have that sort of friendship, and that you were honest about it with your girlfriend. I don’t think your girlfriend is an asshole for feeling uncomfortable with it, especially since she has been cheated on. It’s good that she is communicating with you when she feels discomfort. She’s also not an asshole for asking if it’s something you’re willing to stop doing. But I do think it would be wrong for her to expect you to  change your friendship. She is the new person in this scenario, she’s only known you a few months. You’ve had MANY YEARS of possible opportunities to have a sexual relationship with the friend, and it hasn’t happened. I consider it controlling behavior to expect you to completely alter your longest friendship for her. 

For the record, I’m a woman who has been cheated on in many relationships. I feel insecure or distrusting at times. I work on that with my therapist, instead of expecting others to change themselves due to my issues. If she’s unwilling to work on herself, and come to terms with her past to accept your friendship, I think you two are incompatible. I think a reasonable compromise to ease her fears would be to suggest she discusses this with your friend/sister one on one. If your sister also tells her that she sees the relationship in a completely platonic way, it could make your gf feel better."

Thritis,fp6denf,t1_fp10wce,1588350423.0,"Sorry for the delayed response, I’ve still been working remotely. It’s definitely understandable that you feel like you can’t do anything. It’s a very difficult position to be in when you’re not feeling well. I hope the doctors will move this process along as quickly as possible for you. Until then, there are many things you could try to help the pain. For joint pain and swelling, I follow RICE (alternate between Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevate), but I also use an infrared heating pad. I like to do showers where I switch between colder and warmer water. For compression, I use self adherent wrap tape, and tighten it around the painful area. A compression sleeve, or compression gloves, can work for this as well. I also like to use foam rollers or other self-massaging tools. 

There are topical creams to put on your skin over painful areas— things like Tiger Balm and Voltaren gel can provide relief. If you live somewhere that CBD or medical marijuana is legal, those are other great options for pain management. R/cbd has great info. I have a medical marijuana card, so my main pain medication is marijuana edibles, cbd oil, and CBD/THC skin creams. The skin creams are great— I rub some on my hands, feet and any other painful areas. 

Without some moving around throughout the day, joints can stiffen up more, causing extra pain. I try to do some gentle movement every day. Some days I go for a walk, or I do a gentle stretching routine (there are a lot of great youtube videos). But when I’m too exhausted, I might just do a few quick stretches in my bed, and can barely walk across my small apartment. So it’s important to be a bit active, unless your fatigue is telling you to rest and sleep. When you see your doctor next, maybe ask if it’s possible to get a referral for physical therapy. I found aquatherapy PT very helpful. Distractions are also helpful- movies, podcasts, books/audiobooks, or anything else you enjoy. I hope you find something here that works for you!"

I remember how awful it was waiting for a diagnosis, all symptoms worsening. I honestly think it was the worst part of having arthritis for me, so far. Medications and a proper diagnosis have helped me a ton. I had a lot of normal blood work as well, so getting a diagnosis was long and frustrating. It sucks to wait, get a round of tests, wait again, have no answers, repeat. You are in such a tough position, but it sounds like you have a good medical team trying to figure this out. For some types of arthritis, like RA, over a third of patients don’t have blood markers.


I’m really glad to hear your doctors are planning for MRIs, I really hope that will help get you some answers! My RA diagnosis finally happened after getting ultrasound images of my joints. As soon as my rheumatologist saw the images, I had a diagnosis and treatment plan fairly quickly. The inflammation from RA and other types of auto immune arthritis can be visible in ultrasound and MRI. MRI is the best bet. So you are on the right track. Once you have a diagnosis and treatment, things should get easier than they are now. Just try to hold on a bit longer. Did the doctors try to give you a steroid yet?

I’d try to do deeper waterings, keeping the same frequency at first, and increase frequency slowly from there if it’s still acting like this.

Other possibilities not mentioned here so far...if the plant is indoors, even with full sun exposure, it may need a plant light to prevent it from flopping over. Some plants need a lot of light to grow rigid, and they will fall over in less ideal lighting conditions. In this case, the yellowing would be a separate issue, possibly needs fertilzer."

I had completely normal X rays, and mostly normal blood work. I just kept pushing for a diagnosis. I switched doctors several times. You are not alone. Please keep fighting for answers and a treatment plan. 

RA can be so much more manageable with the right medications. Steroids are a temporary band aid, you need some real RA meds. Long term meds (DMARDs, bDMARDs) can slow the progression of RA and really improve your pain and fatigue. I thought I would need mobility aids, and possibly file for disability.

TwoXChromosomes,fo61oyq,t3_g5skds,1587543204.0,"You are not alone. I struggled with this in every past relationship. In my current relationship, I can thankfully say it’s no longer a problem. So this issue lasted until I was 24-25, I’m 28 now. I think women are socially conditioned to view the man’s gratification as the most important part of sex. The man reaching climax is “the end” of sex, when they are “finished”, things are over. That sends us a message that our pleasure is less valuable, theirs is the most important. We get that message reinforced by watching tv and movies, and interacting with partners who don’t value our pleasure. Many of us have experienced an impatient partner who asks “did you come yet”? If anyone ever asks me that, I am NOT going to come. Some men act like pleasing us is a chore, which contributes to feeling guilty. It’s a problem that doesn’t have a quick or easy fix. It requires working on yourself, and the right attitude from your partner.

Two things need to happen. First, you need to believe that it’s important for you to climax. Your partner’s pleasure is not more important than your own. They should want to please you as well. You deserve it! It is not a waste of time. This doesn’t happen quickly, it took me years of patience and going to therapy before it improved. When I was still having this issue, I found ways of experiencing pleasure with a partner that didn’t make me feel guilty. You could both touch each other at the same time, do oral sex at the same time, or try to use a vibrator/toy during sex. I found all of these to be successful because my partner is getting pleasure, so I’m able to enjoy it myself without feeling guilty.

The second thing you need is support from your partner. It sounds like he’s doing some things right, by telling you he enjoys pleasing you, and investing time in it. So that’s a good start. It only works if you trust him and believe he wants to please you (and enjoys doing it). You also need to feel completely safe and comfortable. Communicate about the things you both like and dislike. For example, do you enjoy when he shoves underwear in your mouth? If so, great! If not, tell him before the next time you have sex that he shouldn’t do it anymore. This stuff takes work and patience. I’m here if you need to talk or have any questions. Best of luck to you!"

I’d always feel guilty and anxious that it was taking too long, they shouldn’t spend so much time on me. I’d often turn the focus back to my partner from being uncomfortable.

I switched insurance plans in the beginning of the year, and was told one of my meds was “non formulary” which means insurance couldn’t approve it right away.

I’m also hoping your med change will have a positive effect for you over time. It can take months before a new combination starts working. I hope things get easier for you."
rheumatoid,fmxwo7c,t3_fy29gr,1586473355.0,"Yes, my RA symptoms absolutely worsen before my period. I think that’s common with a lot of chronic illnesses. I have a low dose hormone IUD, and I haven’t noticed any difference in this issue from this form of birth control."
Fibromyalgia,fmgox1c,t1_fmgn3iz,1586054024.0,"I recently started taking a muscle relaxer because of insomnia, but aside from that I haven’t taken any fibromyalgia medications for over two years. I have rheumatoid arthritis, and I felt that taking additional meds for fibro would be way too many medications to keep track of. I manage the pain with gentle exercise, and medical marijuana (edibles and topicals to rub on skin). I found aquatherapy to be the most helpful exercise for managing my pain and fatigue. It’s physical therapy in a heated pool, followed by TENS unit and massage from a physical therapist. My rheumatologist wrote me a prescription for 2 visits per week for 4 months. I was able to build strength with low impact exercise, and I still try to do the exercises on my own. When I can’t get to a pool, I try to go for long walks, and do yoga. When the pain is bad, I do gentle stretches in bed. Keep moving, even if it’s small steps. I also find massage very helpful, myofascial release and hot stone massage in particular. I hope some of this helps you!"

Thritis,fmfii5c,t1_fmfh960,1586027957.0,"You’re right, many people do just listen to the first doctor they see. Doctors are supposed to be smart, but that doesn’t mean they’re always right. I’m sure it’s a very difficult time to be seeing different doctors in all the panic. I’m glad you’re seeing a rheumatologist and another neurologist soon, that’s very good to hear. I hope they help you!"
Thritis,fmfgmao,t3_fuylcr,1586026823.0,"What kind of doctors have you been seeing? If possible, see a rheumatologist. If a doctor dismisses you or doesn’t help, I recommend seeing a new one. Keep pushing until you find answers. I had to see 3 primary care doctors and 4 rheumatologists before I finally got diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. What you’re experiencing could be arthritis or something else, but you definitely need testing and specialist doctors to figure this out. Best of luck to you! I hope you find answers."

rheumatoid,fm88ea6,t3_ftonum,1585844721.0,My doctor told me that significant hair loss is not an acceptable side effect. I’m supposed to get in touch with her ASAP and change meds if it happens.
airplants,fm884f6,t3_ftkz1q,1585844576.0,"I think it’s fine to reuse this water for most plants, I water a majority of my plants with the airplant water and they’re fine. I wouldn’t recommend using it for a carnivorous plant, since they’re very sensitive."

This website allows you to select categories that are triggering to you, and you can use it to check whether a show/movie has triggers. It’s great to be able to see whether I will be triggered by something I’m interested in, or something other people recommend for me. I hope this helps!"
Thritis,fm1ux6u,t3_fsjb4c,1585685458.0,"I’m sorry about your nausea, its an awful symptom, and you were dealing with so much anxiety on top of that. It must have been very difficult. I had nausea with MTX pills as well. I’m happy to report I have no negative side effects with Humira, except some redness and itchiness at the injection site. I highly recommend putting an ice pack over the injection site afterwards, it helps a lot. I’ve been taking Humira for over a year with no issues, even after increasing my dose to 1 shot per week."
AmItheAsshole,fm1cbeb,t3_fscpv3,1585675840.0,"Congrats! As a recommendation, I love the Crash Bandicoot games. They’re reboots of a game that came out when I was younger. The trilogy is a good single player game, and it’s really 3 games for the price of 1. Their Nitro Refueled racing game is multi player and very fun. There’s even battles, where you all try to blow up each other’s cars instead of racing haha."
