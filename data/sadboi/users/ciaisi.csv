There's no misrepresentation. 

You order a pizza for a price from a licensed restaurant with a new name. They prepare and deliver a pizza for the agreed upon price.

actualconspiracies,fr2orgo,t1_fr2l160,1589841054.0,">It's shady, pathetic

Why? Who cares. You ordered a pizza, you got a pizza from a restaurant that has a history of making and serving pizza. This is just a shift in marketing. Shady? Maybe a little, but not really. Lots of companies rebrand to escape negative connotations associated with their name. Lots of restaurants change names and decor/branding / marketing to generate new business. 

Pathetic? Absolutely the opposite. This is a business that is doing what they can to survive, and a smart pivot to doing something they already do in a slightly different way. 

I like to try new places from time to time, sometimes I like them, sometimes I don't. If I try a new place called Charles E.s, and I don't love it, fine, I won't order again. If I do, again, fine, it came out of a kitchen of a children's arcade that is held to the same health code standards as any other restaurant. You're probably more likely to get bad food from an independent restaurant as there is no corporate oversight. 

But honestly, I haven't had a Chuck E Cheeze pizza in ages. Maybe it's good, maybe it isn't. I've eaten a lot of Little Caesars hot & ready pizzas in my day, can't be much worse."
amibeingdetained,fr1634t,t1_fr12m91,1589813953.0,"Nope, you're misunderstanding my point. I replied to the parent comment, but I'll give you the same info here.

They do get something special in that it is a unique protection. It's a morally just protection, but unique nonetheless. My point is that some rational people might worry about the potential effects this could have in terms of firing someone or terminating a lease or some other protected event. Someone could now claim discrimination because they are gay just to get the payout.

I don't think that's going to happen all that often, and I think the majority of opposition comes from bigots. If you want to persuade someone you need to understand where they're coming from instead of just implying that they don't get it.

So now we have a government filled with cronies and yes men instead of those qualified to actually fill the roles they've been appointed to. And why? Because all Trump cares about is himself and his own image.

As long as they can find a balance where I can play the games I like and enjoy a full experience without needing to purchase any extra BS, I suppose I can get behind that.

I think the personalities of one of the players and the DM were just too different from the rest of the group.

bipolar2,fpmu8ap,t3_gecsbw,1588741867.0,"Your feelings are valid. And it sucks to feel the way you describe. Yes, we here can relate.

First, I know this is super hard, but it is important that you manage your emotions as best as you can. Please don't mistake this to mean that whole ""don't blame your disorder"" thing. More that you have been afflicted with an unfortunate disorder that is very difficult to control sometimes. Nevertheless, cultivating a way to manage your emotions as best as you can will help. And when you can't, that's OK.

What helps me is recognizing when I feel irritable. I remind myself that the way I feel isn't the fault of the person that I'm talking to, and that they don't deserve my ire. It's hard, but that makes it so that I'm more able to maintain control and not lash out.

As for the depression and depersonalization... Man those lows can be reaaallly low. I don't have any tips other than to take care of yourself. Getting out of bed is hard. Taking a shower is hard. Cooking or even warming up a meal is hard. I don't have any answers other than to fight through it as much as you can. I'll take a day to myself, try to sleep it off, maybe try to eat something healthy. There's no magic bullet unfortunately. Just gotta fight through it.

That's the shitty thing. You just have to force yourself to be strong day-in and day-out. And when you can't, you just have to put yourself first and take care of you. Just try not to alienate those that are important to you in the meantime."
bipolar2,fpmt8a4,t3_ged2cy,1588741097.0,"You might not need meds forever, but being perfectly honest, you will almost definitely feel better overall if you stick with them and follow your doctor's recommendations.

A lot of people think they don't need meds anymore because they feel better. Duh, that's the meds doing their job.

Lamotrigine is a great med. Helped me a ton when I first started on it. I'm planning on taking it until I find something that helps more or works better. There are some ways that Lamotrigine blunts my emotions, but it makes it so much easier to regain control when I'm getting super irritable.

I've accepted that there's likely a chemical imbalance that isn't going to fix itself. If the meds help, I'll keep taking them. If not I'll work with my doctor to find something that does."

privacytoolsIO,fpjzoza,t1_fpjxvuk,1588684947.0,"The problem is that it isn't very specific into what it actually does. A big part of it is ""we will form a committee and the committee will decide on the rules"".

While it doesn't specifically outlaw encryption, this is almost certainly their angle to get a back door. Every time they've tried in the past, they have been met with such resistance that they had to back off. Now they have the plausible deniability of saying that this bill doesn't technically outlaw full E2E encryption. But make no mistake, if that's what their grand committee decides, those are likely the rules that will be implemented.

This legislation is far too vague for the amount of power it ultimately wields.

Beyond contacting your senators, start pinging big tech companies. Everyone knows how much power lobbyists have in DC. While I'm sure they're already fighting, let them know you support them on this issue."

gaming,fphiete,t1_fphaveo,1588621830.0,"Mostly experience in these and similar games. The game will typically try to spawn you near an open spot on the map where enemies aren't present.

Modern FPS games have gotten better about not spawn locking you on one point, but if you keep your distance from that flag that they hold, it will tend to spawn them there.

I don't know exact spawn points, but I definitely know when the spawn has flipped. Ex your team holds A and B, someone pushes C and suddenly enemies start spawning on A."
