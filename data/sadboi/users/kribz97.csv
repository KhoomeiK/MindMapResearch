**Divide facts from your opinion on facts.**

Facts are: his answers are different/he didnt text you goodmorning/no Emoji.

Your opinion on it is everything that follows. That youre losing him. That youre a burden.

About which one youre anxious and upset about? Facts or opinion? 

Sure these facts may mean that youre bothering him. May. But there is probabbly around milion possibilities why his answers are different. You losing him is one of them. One. Not 100% correct one. Youre not a fairy, a witch to know what he thinks. Of course reassurance is only short lasting relief. Because youre stuck with thinking that your opinion is 100% correct one."

But from what you say, despite all of this - you like this job, dont you? Maybe the job itself isn't a source of panic and anxiety? Maybe its buried way deeper? I dont know. Its something you should work on with your therapist. But what I'm trying to tell you is... You at least like this job. If you will fight these anxiety during therapy you will be still having a job you like. That's a bright side of it, isn't it? Youre not stuck at job you hate. 

Im sorry to hear about your GF grandpa. My condolences.  I dont have anything wise to say here. Stay strong, friend. 

About school. Leave it for now. Thinking about it. Focus on working on therapy. You still have time to think about what you want to do next semester. Dont pressure yourself to know all the answers RIGHT NOW. Its not possible I know. What my therapist once said to me was that anxiety is sometimes like... Strong urge to control what's uncontrolable.  That's where this anxiety is coming from. From not knowing. Maybe in normal circuimistances knowing what you will do next semester is controlable. But during global pandemic? NOT really. No one knows right now what we will be doing in lets say 6 months. Dont demand from yourself na answer that you cant have.
