bipolar2,ezac7nl,t3_d0e9me,1567798692.0,"My sleep hours are steadily dropping, with no noticable change in energy. Plus, my resting heart rate is rapidly climbing. Together, these are the most accurate warning signs of an upcoming episode."
bipolar2,ewyk5kz,t1_ewxy0jp,1565882458.0,Probably around 3 weeks (I remember getting it refilled *once*); I kept trying to see if the side effects would get better. It also dropped my blood pressure into noticeably low ranges.
bipolar2,ewx0nvk,t3_cqji1k,1565840502.0,"Trazodone was awful for me. It was one of the not-so-great steps in treating my depression, GAD, and insomnia (this was pre-BP2 diagnosis). Even on the low introductory dose (I've forgotten what it was), I would have the 'hangover' until after lunchtime the next day. The sleep I did get was very poor and I was miserably tired for most of the day. These side-effects started within the first week of starting the drug, IIRC."
BipolarReddit,ethd9ry,t1_eth8wa3,1562812330.0,"I've been able to do the same thing. I tend to purchase hobby supplies for things that I've never done and won't follow through with after an episode (painting, photography, etc.)"
bipolar2,erajhsk,t1_er86st2,1560645753.0,"Yes! Like others, I tried the commonly hyped apps, but none of them worked as well as eMoods. I'm thinking of buying a lifetime pass so I can add custom trackers for self-harm or suicidal thoughts as well."
BipolarReddit,eqfjv19,t1_eqfjmp3,1560021976.0,"That's really good to know, thank you. I always thought that you had to basically have plans in action before you were 'qualified' to be committed. If you don't mind me asking: so you weren't planning on acting on those thoughts, but they became so intrusive you lost the ability to function well?"
