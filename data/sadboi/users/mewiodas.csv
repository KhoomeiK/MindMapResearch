CPTSDmemes,fmu985d,t3_fx7uf4,1586386917.0,"I started taking prazosin about a year ago for nightmares. It was working until... It wasn’t. When I first started it, I stopped having nightmares, but I stopped dreaming completely too. About a month ago, I started having vivid nightmares and hallucinating during the day again. My fitbit also noted that my sleep quality went down, and I was waking up too frequently. Switched to a new one (can’t think of the name, it’s an antihistamine), and not only am I not having nightmares, I’m having good dreams, and absolutely no nightmares, and my sleep quality is better on the new medication than on the old one. But yeah, the last month or so was ROUGH and basically this meme every night"
NoStupidQuestions,fmpt0bw,t1_fmnkmp0,1586286791.0,It’s weird bc I almost always hear things like this. I want to get a new lamp in my room bc it’s *so* loud. I’m usually tired after cooking bc it’s so loud. I can hear my parents’ TV in the other room and it sounds incredibly loud when I know it logically isn’t. Usually I’m listening to music bc everything is so noisy around me. Idk how I managed to miss this

ftm,fmfgcwj,t3_fusqfj,1586026661.0,"If he’s told you, it’s more than likely he’s spent a lot of time thinking about it, and feels safe coming to you with it. I’m 20, I first knew at 14, but hid it until 16 (when I came out at school), and then came out to family at 18. But I distinctly remember insisting all throughout school I was a boy, telling my parents I wanted to be a priest, and *hating* going clothing shopping. But for many people, there’s no signs or talking about it beforehand.  

And even if it is a phase, it’s very important you respect him and his name and pronouns. Gender is fluid, yes, but how you treat him in his identity now will determine how he comes to you regarding other important things in the future. Calling him he/him and Jack may feel insurmountable, but it’s really a very small step that will mean the world to him"
AskReddit,fmewrul,t3_fuoji0,1586015211.0,"Top surgery (surgery to remove breast tissue, typically done on trans guys but also done on cis guys with gynecomastia). My insurance covers HRT but not any surgeries. I’ve wanted top surgery since I knew what it was, since before I even knew I was trans. Besides the fact I’m trans and my chest causes massive dysphoria, I also have pretty bad back pain from it. I’ve had back pain probably since I was 14 or younger, my insurance won’t even cover a reduction to reduce back pain (probably bc I have a diagnosis of gender dysphoria already). Top surgery in my area runs about $8k-10k.  

I have to lose weight to qualify first though. Gives me plenty of time to save up."

bipolar,fmddccw,t1_fmdbed7,1585964996.0,"Yikes. I like (read: do not like) how you say teenage girls and not teenage boys. Maybe, just maybe, teenage girls are more likely to discuss how they’re feeling and try to get help? I’m not that far off in age from teenage girls (I only graduated hs a couple years ago), and I know for a fact they aren’t glamorizing mental illness or pretending to have it. If anything, girls are far more open about living with mental illness than guys, it’s extremely hard for us to open up about it.  
Many people do not have the words for what they’re feeling until somebody high profile talks about it and it clicks. It also helps normalize bipolar disorder. It shows people without the illness “Hey, if that person has it, who do I know who has it? If that celebrity has it, maybe it’s not something freaky or abnormal.” It’s incredibly important for celebrities to talk about it to help show folks what it’s like, and help normalize it."

bipolar,fmd9q44,t1_fmd67v4,1585962535.0,"Again, nobody is going to up and say they have bipolar simply bc Selena has it. What somebody *might* do is they might see what Selena has gone through, say “Oh that sounds like me,” and then seek treatment and find out they have it, when they otherwise wouldn’t have known bc they didn’t even know what bipolar is. I honestly wouldn’t have found out about bipolar if it wasn’t for posts online on Tumblr about bipolar back when I was in high school, and if it weren’t for those posts talking about it and celebrities like Carrie Fisher, I would’ve probably not known, or been too scared of what was going on to ask and get help.
