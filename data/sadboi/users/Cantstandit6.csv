Nationwide wise, it will be a miracle if Democrats win the senate because according to the cook political report (I trust them more), it looks like Democrats will be lucky to break even in the senate with Republicans. And that's only if joe biden wins and his vice president candidate will be the one to break a tie so it's kind of wishful thinking for democrats to really win."

But I understand your grievance by specifically white males. Last time I checked, males are 4 times more likely to have autism then females. As for the race factor, that's a fault to today's society overlooking minorities which is a shame.

As for ones I have no opinion or negative opinion in order of year release:

Movies: rain man (supporting character), miracle run (2 boys), my name is Khan (rizwan), extremely loud and incredibly close (oskar), 2017 power rangers movie (billy)

Tv: st. Elsewhere (Tommy westphall), degrassi next generation (connor), sesame street (julia), the good doctor (shawn Murphy)
