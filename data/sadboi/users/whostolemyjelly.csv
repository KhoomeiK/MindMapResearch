I was eyeing it suspiciously but it was broad daylight, plus I was very close to home so I wasn't too scared... but he (I could see his silhouette in the window) kept slowing down when I would slow down so that made me a little nervous. When we turned corners he would disappear and just as I would start to think he was gone he would show up again. Eventually I became paranoid that he was going to kidnap us so I told my friend to go ahead of me and I would follow her home, but to hurry. She wasn't nearly as worried as I was, but when I told her to hurry she definitely picked up on it. When we arrived at my driveway the car sped up until it came to a screeching halt at my house and the guy opened the door to his car and bolted out. I told her to leave the bike and run. We sprinted inside and locked the door. 

We hid in my room and the guy knocked on the door and talked to my mom.  *Apparently* he was just trying to be nice and watch us to make sure we were safe, and my mom thanked him but said I knew what I was doing. He said we looked ""young and vulnerable"" (ew??) so he just wanted to make sure we got home safe. 

Yeah we didn't come out from under my bed for like an hour. I never actually saw his face but my mom said she didn't recognize him and that she didn't think he lived in the neighborhood... which was also creepy to me."

I was pissed because I had missed a shit ton of summer practice because of my epilepsy and a mild heat stroke. The tear wasn't my fault, so that's not what I regret necessarily... the regret comes from not leaving that school sooner. The school I was at was notoriously difficult and a lot of people struggle to keep up. It's the top academically in the state but the pressure and time you have to put in is fucking bonkers. I was becoming suicidal because I felt trapped, and I had wanted to leave for a long time but I felt like I couldn't because then I would never get into a good college (that's basically what they tell you). When I had to have surgery the following month, I couldn't walk, and missing school for that long was not an option for me (I'm a perfectionist for grades and I also have an anxiety disorder so big yikes). The school therapist/psychiatrist/whatever yelled at me about how stupid I was for 45 minutes because I was a ""waste of potential"" for leaving. I just regret not leaving that summer because now I'm so happy in an online school where I can work at my own pace and level, but I started so late that my classes are all due by April 2nd and I'm really stressed and I think I'm starting to sink back into a hole of depression.
