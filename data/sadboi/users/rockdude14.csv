Big machines have e stops.  If there's a fire it's either going to short out, or likely not matter.  Plus if there's a fire, very few places have rules like, everyone goes out except for electricians they need to find the right breaker and turn it off.  Fire dept will be fine, and they won't want extra people in the building.

Someone being electrocuted and stuck to a live wire, e stop if machine or big non conductive stick to knock them off.  Been at places with some seriously high voltage that had those all over the place.

It's so when an electrician works on it they have room.  Moving a really can is easy, but how do you write that rule.  What about a stack of folding chairs?  Takes longer but still very moveable.
