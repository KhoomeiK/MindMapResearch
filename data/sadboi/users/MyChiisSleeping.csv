Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fr5f2af,t1_fr5c6mg,1589907505.0,I‚Äôm so with you on this. I could probably stand to lose more like 150.. but I would be happy with 100 at this point. My chronic pain has made it near impossible these days. There was a time I pushed through it and got stronger and saw a good amount of progress... but then had a health setback and am back where I started. Except I‚Äôm a lot less motivated. I say we get a motivation chain going! Small progress each day. We can do this!
Random_Acts_Of_Amazon,fr5eqin,t3_gmmx5z,1589907350.0,"I‚Äôm trying to pay down my credit card debt. The interest is what‚Äôs killing me. I knew I was getting into a mess when it started, but we had just bought a house and had a lot of initial expenses, so I bit the bullet and have been trying to be responsible since then. I‚Äôm making slow progress, but I had a set back a couple years ago and basically lost a years worth of progress paying things down. I‚Äôm finally at a point where I consistently haven‚Äôt used my credit cards for over 6 months for anything at all and I‚Äôm just paying them down. I was doing really well with the snowball method last year and was able to pay off the card with the highest interest. It has remained paid off and I was working on the next one when the pandemic hit. I‚Äôm back to making minimum payments to avoid any financial uncertainties that may stem from this crisis, so my debt is shrinking much slower again... but it‚Äôs still going down and that‚Äôs what counts. 

My goal is to find more ways to tighten the belt so I can pay down the cards faster... this pandemic and working remotely has saved me tons of gas and lunch money. Now I just need to be better about not being wasteful or indulging myself so often."

CatAdvice,fr5bt4k,t1_fr487mz,1589905956.0,"I‚Äôm sure they knew. But when we brought her in as a TNR of a feral cat, they likely didn‚Äôt even think to mention it because they do those kind of procedures all the time. Overfilled shelter, population control, lack of resources... whatever the reason, they likely assumed nobody wanted to take responsibility for her so they just performed the procedure and noted it on the paperwork. We had had no idea, but the TNR program is just ‚Äúdrop them off first thing and pick them up end of the day‚Äù community service, not me personally taking my cat to a vet to have her looked at. It‚Äôs a well intentioned program, but there are a few drawbacks. Especially for those of us who would be willing to be more involved. She‚Äôs well taken care of here, but I‚Äôm sure they are used to animals that are just released back into the neighborhood and aren‚Äôt really cared for."
CatAdvice,fr40z72,t3_gmdxq2,1589872163.0,"I‚Äôve cared for a feral colony where a mother cat lost a kitten rather suddenly at about 3 weeks old. She seemed to understand pretty quickly that the baby was gone and I guess you could say she did mourn at first. She spent most of the next two days going back and forth between taking care of her remaining kittens and guarding the spot where her baby died. Within a week, she was caught up with her other babies, though, and seemed fine. 

On the flip side of that, there was a cat on the property of the house we bought that we TNRed. We found out after the fact that she had been pregnant when they spayed her. (We were devastated.) when she woke up, she frantically wandered the house looking for her kittens. I think it broke her, honestly. To be spayed while her hormones were high and her mothers instinct so strong. It‚Äôs been 4 years and she still comes into the house about once a week, wanders through the whole place howling as if she‚Äôs looking for something, then goes back out to the yard. I don‚Äôt know if she will ever be the same.

I think a lot of the behaviors are instinctual. In the case of a singleton dying where there are other kittens to care for, I think momma cat moves on reasonably quickly once the scent of her kitten is gone.  They are even known to abandon a weakling if they believe it will die anyway or lessen the chance of survival of the other kittens. They aren‚Äôt savage, really. It‚Äôs just instinct. They learn different behaviors based on their environment. So if you take a feral cat and domesticate it, some of those instincts go away as they become dependent on us. They also may take cues from how we are behaving. So I think you gave her the day to see and be near the baby that died. I think removing it now is probably best. And once the kitten‚Äôs scent has disappeared (usually a few days) her focus will likely fix on the remaining litter mates."

We finished the whole series in the week she was out of school. Now a days, I can barely get her to sit through three or four episodes at a time and she is on her phone through the majority of it.

I made a list of shows or movies that are adaptations of a book and have been collecting the books to read before watching the movies.
