Constructive criticism helps improve while criticism points out only the wrong or bad. 

Criticism is almost never helpful or useful (I say almost because there are individuals who thrive on negative review or criticism to improve, but to each their own). 

Critique allows for the reviewer to put their criticism into more of an ""I"" form. 

In academia we often use the sandwich method to help encourage positive critique. This method has you start with a positive (and there are usually always positives depending on the context) and then you talk about the negative(s) which can include things done wrong or things that can be approved. Again, we stick with ""I"" statements. And then you end on another positive note. You also always try to give examples or suggestions for the negatives."

He should definitely not have to wear earplugs to sleep. They can hurt people and cause other issues.

I had a roommate who was up later than me and would be talking/playing games, etc. It kept me up and it was so hard to sleep. I asked him to be quieter and I eventually adjusted. 

Are your beds on the same wall? Can he still hear you if you are in a space furthest from his room inside? If you are being super quiet? 

He can't ask you to go outside to talk if you are already doing your best. Unless you live in a paper house I can't imagine it being a problem if you are genuinely trying to be quiet. 

It also could be you aren't being as quiet as you think."

relationships,fqgbvvd,t3_girbxi,1589342442.0,"Ok, first off, your attitude is really questionable. Take a step back and look at the full picture.

You are normally gone and have set up a system of being in charge of buying things. You've never had a problem with how she lived before and suddenly you do because you have to experience it. 

I'm not saying she shouldn't carry her own weight but this is a stuff you should have discussed and set up together before moving in. Calling her childish seems completely unfair. 

Look at it from her perspective- she has been living this way for as long as you have been roommates (I am guessing this isn't a recent behavior change because if it is it changes everything).

How much one cleans or participates in buying/paying for supplies is something roommates discuss and agree on immediately after agreeing to live together. You have had ZERO issues until now because you're stuck at home and have to deal with her/how she lives in a way you didn't before. If she is reacting negatively (you cant assume her mumbling is aimed at you. I mumble talk to myself all the time) and won't discuss/make plans for cleaning/shopping/splitting things evenly and that's a deal breaker for you (though, I feel like I need to point out it wasnt for all long time) then find subleaser or put up with it until the end of the lease.

Ultimately, you can't force her to do anything. Stop providing supplies if she doesn't pay half or help shop for them. Clean up after yourself and she'll keep cleaning up after herself."

relationship_advice,fqgajbb,t3_giqnmx,1589341565.0,"Personal trauma doesn't excuse traumatizing others. If you haven't, seek out therapy again. Keep going to school. If you feel safe keeping your dad at arm's length be careful. 

Have an escape plan. Have backup if you need to go no contact.

My mom wasn't that physically abusive but she was mentally and emotionally abusive and neglectful my entire childhood. When I reached about 25 she changed. We have a good relationship now but what she did in the past won't ever go away.

 People CAN change but usually if something has happened to make them change. Has he gone through anything to illicit this change?"

It's easy to feel guilty about cutting family out of your life in this world. Family is often pushed as forever. 

She is unwell and obviously has traumatized you. She basically tries to kidnap you at one point!

Cutting her out was your decision but it was her own fault you got to that point."

Nope. Flash flood."

 At this point, breaking the engagement and leaving will help your mental and physical health SO MUCH.

I think you should be wary of him doing nice things for you if you try to break it off. He seems like the type who will love bomb you to get you to stay."
