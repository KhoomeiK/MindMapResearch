I used to use an excel spreadsheet almost identical to OPs for years; and would plan out my checks for the next 4-6 months. But I NEVER got ahead, and always overspent and never knew where my money was going. I switched to YNAB less than a year ago and have paid off all my debts, cut back on grocery and “Misc” spending habits, AND saved an emergency fund. Totally worth the yearly cost imo. Took some getting used to, but I’m obsessed now. I didn’t use the import tool; I prefer entering my transactions manually because it helps me to hold myself accountable for my spending and it makes me more conscious of what I’m buying. I love that ynab allows me to see where my money is going; and what I can do to change that."

I know I have low self control when I see “good” deals at the store when I shop. Therefore, I’ve been using Walmart grocery pick up for 95+% of my groceries (I buy a few things in bulk at Costco). by doing this, I know I’m ONLY getting what I need for the week - nothing more. I’ve saved a quite a bit of money and have had less waste. And also time - I’m in and out of the pickup line in 5 minutes, versus an hour spent physically shopping if I hadn’t used the service. 
I’m not sure about other stores, but Walmart doesn’t jack the price up for using this service. Blueberries are $2.99 on the pick up app, And $2.99 in store. I tested this because I know instacart adds a fee to each item and it ends up being way more expensive."

I think he needs some therapy to learn to cope with grief from losing his gf but also to learn how to grieve WHILE loving a new person.

It’s been almost 16 years for me and, while it still sucks SO bad, and there are days I just wish I could call him up to chat - it does get easier to breathe. Allow yourself to feel sad, Angry, at peace. Anything you feel is normal. Grief has no timeline and no straight lines.

My partner of a decade died and I started dating less than a year later. That doesn’t make me a shitty person. Just like it doesn’t make her mom shitty.

I thought the same... I won’t ever be happy and I can’t ever imagine loving anyone else. But the truth is- you’re right, life likes to prove us wrong. I met someone and have been with him for almost a year and it’s just so amazing. He has truly saved me. He makes me happy. I did have those guilty feelings the first 6-9 months.  Why should I get to go on with life when he can’t? how can I happy when I lost my first true major love? And those feelings are 100% normal. But I will tell you this - realizing that HE died, I did NOT made the guilty feelings go away and allowed me to open up more and be okay with being happy with my current bf. I don’t deserve a miserable life because I lost him. I deserve happiness just like everyone else. A talk with his dad actually is what helped me most. He told me that, yes, he died, but that’s only one chapter in my book - not the whole thing. I will have other experiences and other moments. Yes, they won’t be with him. But they’ll be MINE and I deserve to be happy and loved. And so do you! Your partner will  always be a part of you. If you have a chance, watch the ted talk video by Nora McInerny “We don't ""move on"" from grief. We move forward with it”. It’s about her husband dying from cancer and then her finding someone new and moving FORWARD. Because you never move “on”. It helped me so much!"

widowers,eyeqy5g,t3_cwow66,1567037728.0,"Sorry you’ve had a rough day. Must be something in the weather because I, too, have been really down today. Ironically- my fiancé was THAT guy. Yet life took him away from his two little girls and I. Tomorrow night is 2 years and I find myself crying today, when I thought I was stronger than this. But here we are. 
Thinking of you and sending you positive thoughts. ❤️"
widowers,eyebuts,t3_cwqdp6,1567031609.0,"You are not alone and your feelings are 100% valid. I have a 3 year old and 5 year old. Been solo parenting for 2 years (tomorrow, actually ..) when their dad died unexpectedly. ITS SO. HARD.  I often lose my shit and basically never feel like a good parent. It definitely takes a toll. Can you join a gym or local library that way you can get a break several times a week? Hang in there. We are all in this together. Message me if you ever need to let it out."
happycryingdads,ey7crdu,t1_ey596lx,1566878556.0,"100% agree.  My fiancé was only 28 when he died. I don’t think you’re being extreme at all. I think you’re just being prepared. None of us know when it’s our time; so better to do things just in case. Otherwise, he’d be left with none. I’ve been taking videos for my daughters and sending them to an email for them to have when they’re older."
happycryingdads,ey3u4if,t3_cvewes,1566773757.0,"I am so sorry to hear this. PLEASE, if you haven’t already - make videos for your little girl. Could be videos of you speaking to her, or videos of you both (playing, singing,  literally ANYTHING). My daughters’ dad died very unexpectedly when they were almost 2 and 3.5.  
I have ONE video of him dancing with them and they love watching it. My only wish is that we had more video or sound memories. Pictures are great - but nothing compares to them being able to hear his laugh and voice. Positive thoughts and prayers to you and your family."
GriefSupport,ey1guqn,t3_cu30ap,1566699307.0,"First of all I’m so sorry for your loss. I found out my fiancé was texting a girl, someone he had previously dated, the night he died and I wanted SO badly to read the texts ... what was he saying? Did he say he loved her? Wanted to be with her? Was he that unhappy with me? He took his own life (he was severely intoxicated). 
But then I think .... would reading those messages help me or hurt me. Would it provide me with any kind of closure .. at all? 
Probably not. It doesn’t change the fact that he’s gone. 

I honestly try to persuade myself of the best case scenario- like maybe he was telling her he didn’t wish to speak to her ever again because he loved me so much and wanted a life with me. 

Same for you.. I’d try to focus on thinking that he likely didn’t suffer.  He is flying high somewhere and his spirit is watching you and encouraging you to live a full life, in his honor.  

I finally learned that letting go of those “what if’s” helped me heal SO much. I don’t drag myself down as much about it anymore. What’s done is done and unfortunately we can’t change what happened. And Knowing every small detail around the circumstances doesn’t change that :( 
Hang in there."
GriefSupport,ey1g3hw,t3_cu24y5,1566698731.0,I’m 15 years out from losing my dad (I was 14) and I still feel like it’s hard around holidays and anniversaries. I hope you were able to make the most of your birthday yesterday. Thinking of you.
GriefSupport,ey1fjph,t3_cuopry,1566698305.0,I just wanted to say you are very strong and I’m sending healing and positive thoughts your way. It sounds like a tough time. Hang in there.
GriefSupport,ey1f6d1,t3_cv0on7,1566698015.0,"I am so sorry for your loss. My fiancé did the same 2 years ago next week, a father of two. I will tell you the first few weeks were numb for me as well. I felt like I was doing okay when I shouldn’t be .. and then it really hits.  
Also note, the coming year + will be a roller coaster of emotions. Allow yourself to feel what you need to feel. There is no right or wrong way to grieve.  It’s okay to be sad. It’s also okay to be sad in front of your niece and nephew. You, and those around them, will teach them compassion and love and empathy from this.  And most of all: resilience. You can show them its okay to mourn and grieve... and then grow from it. It can’t drag you down. Even though some days it feels like it might. Take those days minute by minute. It doesn’t really get easier, but you will damn sure get stronger. Lean on your family and loved ones harder than ever right now. 
My heart goes out to you. Hang in there."

GriefSupport,ewnhsmd,t3_cp5kot,1565578614.0,"I have no advice about not being angry, because that is an absolutely understandable  emotion in this. But I wanted to say I’m so sorry for your losses. My heart breaks for you. Hang in there."
GriefSupport,evy7azi,t3_clry1g,1564924869.0,"I didn’t do CPR, but had to stop his bleeding (it was alot). I do have PTSD from it. I do feel like I contributed in some way - like if I held the wound tighter he’d still be here. It took about a year and a half for me to stop doing that to myself. I just had to realize nothing could be done. The guilt was extreme.  but it’s not my fault. Just like for you - it’s not your fault either. you did what you could. I’m so sorry you have to think about those moments, it does eventually get a little more bearable. Hang in there. Might I suggest therapy (EMDR May be good in your case) or even writing in a journal if that helps. For me, going to the gym helped release feel good endorphins. Also, CBD at night helps me be able to sleep and not just lay in bed thinking about that day."

GriefSupport,eucajyk,t1_euc9pu5,1563669650.0,That warmed my heart too ❤️ sometimes she draws us with sad faces. So this one was nice that we were smiling too.
GriefSupport,eu9rp96,t1_eu9ihme,1563588840.0,Thank you. Yea she’s been dealt a handful. My grandma (her great gma) passed on Easter this year so it’s been a rough time. It’s sad to me she has to experience such awful losses so early on.
GriefSupport,eu9rn54,t1_eu95xnw,1563588791.0,"So sorry for your loss. I’ll try to find a book like that for her. “Wherever you are, my love will find you” has really helped her through too- might be comforting for you too; talks about all ages. ❤️"
GriefSupport,eu93l8t,t1_eu8xs1b,1563570889.0,Thanks for the book link; that’s great. I’ll have to order some of those
GriefSupport,eu93fvp,t1_eu91h6e,1563570791.0,Thanks; it’s been 2 years at the end of August. We go through waves it seems. Some months she’s okay then it really hits her. We will get through it :) we don’t have a choice huh?
GriefSupport,eu933vm,t1_eu91arg,1563570568.0,I’ll try. She’s staying with my mom this weekend so I’ll tell her that Mimi is always open to talk to if she wants to do so. Great idea
GriefSupport,eu9310e,t1_eu8qbnq,1563570513.0,"Yes, she loves thinking that daddy is with Jesus and in heaven. We look for the brightest stars, or for lightning bugs, butterflies, cardinals, etc. and she likes to point out that it’s dad sending his love. So she “feels” him around. It’s just hard on her it’s not in the physical   form"

GriefSupport,eu92u91,t1_eu8xjyc,1563570389.0,"Yes thank you so much. I do write them down or sometimes make videos (for example if she dreams about him, I ask if I can record her dream and she loves that). I’ll be saving those for when she wants to look back on those memories when she’s older."
GriefSupport,eu8xx5p,t1_eu8rxte,1563567206.0,Thank you for these ideas. I had two of his flannel shirts turned into pillows (one for each girl) and they have a “courage lion” that’s just a stuffed lion the hospital gave me. Today I took her to his favorite lunch spot (hibachi) and we are getting our nails done. We all needed a mental health day.
GriefSupport,eu8xrak,t1_eu8p84k,1563567102.0,I love this idea so much. We will do that this weekend if she is interested in doing so. Thank you so much

Frugal,ero0hds,t1_erncb37,1561065307.0,"We eliminated baby food all together and never used it. There’s a book called Baby led weaning that gives great advice for just starting on real foods. Helps them to learn to chew, rather than just swallowing purées. Good for taste buds and development.  It’s also basically free, because they’re eating the same things you’re eating."
Frugal,ern1m4n,t3_c2wwak,1561042498.0,"Cloth diapers have a decent upfront cost but can be used for the entire 2+ years of baby being in a diaper as long as they’re taken care of. Did it with my first and it was maybe $200? And she used them until she potty trained.

Edit: also adding:
shopping at cheaper stores like Aldi really saves us money. Meal planning. 

Reusable paper towels (I got some on amazon for like $15?) and I just Wash and reuse. paper towels are so expensive. 
So are paper plates - so I try to stay away from using those."
Frugal,eqz5mcw,t3_bzx9a3,1560394269.0,I’d get the Costco one and then maybe a cheapish standing fan to help circulate the air. Worked well for my upstairs

widowers,eqq5hx2,t3_bz1ju3,1560212654.0,"Early on after he died, I’d wish someone would crash into my car while I was driving just to end it all. I never wanted to take my own life, but was perfectly okay with an accident taking it. 
I’m almost 2 years out now and I am so thankful God didn’t answer those prayers of me wishing death. My daughters needed, and continue to need, me. I needed to grow and be independent. I needed to learn to live a happy (although very different) life. I’m grateful for every day now. Hang in there."
widowers,epwlad1,t3_bwc7n3,1559578674.0,"First, Your feelings are 100% valid and okay to be feeling. Second; months 6-12 were harder on me than the first 5 months after he died. Around the 6 month mark things felt more “real” in a sense. I was Independent, doing everything on my own... and I realized he was never going to be there again. The numbness wore off and I was angry and hurt more than I had ever been. 
Around 12/13 months, things started looking up. I felt happiness and didn’t feel guilty for it like I had the first year. I could laugh again, and enjoy life. My daughters and I talk about him and keep his memory and legacy alive. He will ALWAYS be a part of us. 
It gets more bearable, I promise. Hang in there. Try doing something for yourself - go to paint nights or redecorate a room in your home. The gym really helped me get back on my feet and out of my funk. I hated working out. But once I experienced the endorphins from it, I grew to love it. 
You got this. He died, you didn’t. You can still live your full life and enjoy it. Life is short (as we both know from experience), don’t let it pass you by! Find and do things YOU love. Or even things he loved, to experience those too in his honor. 💕💕"
