depression,fjjhg7h,t1_fjjhc0h,1583396230.0,im a woman myself and actually i can say that most of the time they are selfish. it saddens me that not all of them realize that we are all humans and regardless of gender we are capable of feeling down.
depression,fjjh0op,t3_fds0na,1583395668.0,"i feel for you. im sorry you have to go all through this and it feels like that you are all alone. there’s nothing wrong with reaching out for help. the only reason why we ever felt so embarrassed about reaching out or asking for help it is because we keep on having this façade of we are strong, that we dont need help...that maybe this problem will be over soon, that we’ll get over it eventually, but it is really hard when those small problems suddenly piles up. we dont need to be “depressed enough” to be a reason that that’s the only time you can ask for help. i cant really give that much advise since i may be younger than you. i am proud that you ate strong enough to write this post down here for you to vent out what you actually feel. i just hope that everything will get better for you soon."
depression,fhwvcln,t3_f51oky,1581932127.0,"i feel for you. it actually feels like if ever my parents passed on, especially my mother, i don’t really see the purpose of continuing living??? i mean i know to myself that i have goals and all but it feels like im only doing it for them. i wanted to show that im capable, im strong...even though deep inside i know that im not."

ptsd,faaj3xf,t3_e8bj71,1575909488.0,i’m proud of you being able to share your story. letting it all out is a great way to vent your feelings for you  and to everyone around you understand what it is that has been bothering you. sorry i wasn’t able to finish the story because of the trigger warning (i’m also 21 with ptsd). but i’m leaving this comment for you to know that i support you. keep fighting. :)

ptsd,fa6b33o,t3_e7rr0a,1575822909.0,actually yes. my heart also starts to beat much faster whenever i see them. i’m really really scared because they are very judgmental. i always wanted to run whenever those flashbacks comes around.
ptsd,f8y48vv,t3_e2t72n,1574940811.0,"Have you considered taking meds? Since we people have different approaches. Sometimes therapy works for you, sometimes it needs more (meds). As for tips, what you can do for now is surround yourself with people who actually can make you feel better. The people who can actually understand what you feel. Your surroundings can have a huge impact on how you feel. I can also suggest that you can go to a new therapist if you feel like it. :)"
AskReddit,f8j6dfv,t1_f8ftiwn,1574596576.0,"I have the same thought. But now, I stopped taking anti-depressant because it has a shitty side effect tbh and it seems like it made me feel worse. So instead I just focused on therapy itself, since I found it most effective on me. But when I was still taking meds, this is what I feel. I still think the same though except that instead of meds, I gather enough courage to myself to say “I’m not going to die anytime soon, so I guess I’ll make the most of my life” which gathered courage for me to fix myself first instead of keep on pleasing the people around me.
Sorry for my bad english though~"
