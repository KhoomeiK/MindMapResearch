for example, the machine we use to determine if someone has a blocked artery doesn‚Äôt work as well on women, because cholesterol plaques form differently in women. not only did they only discover this in the past 10 years or so, most doctors still don‚Äôt know that this is the case. this means that women‚Äôs artery blockages aren‚Äôt as easy to detect until they‚Äôre dire, and makes women more likely to die of heart disease than men are. 

it‚Äôs not directed AT YOU, or saying anything about you as a person. it‚Äôs not even saying that you in particular don‚Äôt get it. it‚Äôs a symptom of literally thousands of years of women being second-class citizens under male-governed societies. the only part that makes you an asshole would be denying that this even happens, thus ensuring it doesn‚Äôt get addressed. you‚Äôre conflating various issues, and reducing them to how you personally feel. if you can‚Äôt even see that everything isn‚Äôt about you, i don‚Äôt know how you expect to be taken seriously as ‚Äúnot one of THOSE guys.‚Äù 

lots of people don‚Äôt understand the struggles of being blind, or having a hearing deficit, but saying ‚Äúmost hearing people don‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like to not be able to hear, and what things a hearing-impaired person might need‚Äù isn‚Äôt a put down, and neither is this. you‚Äôre just centering yourself in something that actually isn‚Äôt about you. if you were to stop that, you might actually learn something about others‚Äô experience. if you‚Äôre not interested in learning, that‚Äôs your business, but then you can‚Äôt claim to be someone who gets it. that‚Äôs it. those are the choices."

i keep it on my nightstand. i set my alarm a little early, and just flick it on as soon as i shut off my alarm. i browse on my phone for 10-15 minutes(so as not to stare directly into it), then go on about my day. if i slack off using it too long, my sleep cycle can slip after a while has passed, but otherwise it works perfectly. i could go into the neurophysiology of why, but basically it works on your brain like the sun. it sets your circadian rhythms, improves your mood, and(for me) makes me feel more energetic/ready to start the day. i even feel sleepy at a reasonable time of night, which hadn‚Äôt happened since i was a kid. it won‚Äôt get you to sleep tonight, but since this is an ongoing problem for you, i thought i‚Äôd share."
