for example, the machine we use to determine if someone has a blocked artery doesn’t work as well on women, because cholesterol plaques form differently in women. not only did they only discover this in the past 10 years or so, most doctors still don’t know that this is the case. this means that women’s artery blockages aren’t as easy to detect until they’re dire, and makes women more likely to die of heart disease than men are. 

it’s not directed AT YOU, or saying anything about you as a person. it’s not even saying that you in particular don’t get it. it’s a symptom of literally thousands of years of women being second-class citizens under male-governed societies. the only part that makes you an asshole would be denying that this even happens, thus ensuring it doesn’t get addressed. you’re conflating various issues, and reducing them to how you personally feel. if you can’t even see that everything isn’t about you, i don’t know how you expect to be taken seriously as “not one of THOSE guys.” 

lots of people don’t understand the struggles of being blind, or having a hearing deficit, but saying “most hearing people don’t understand what it’s like to not be able to hear, and what things a hearing-impaired person might need” isn’t a put down, and neither is this. you’re just centering yourself in something that actually isn’t about you. if you were to stop that, you might actually learn something about others’ experience. if you’re not interested in learning, that’s your business, but then you can’t claim to be someone who gets it. that’s it. those are the choices."

medical_advice,ffs2lws,t1_ffqcwbp,1580171600.0,"yes. i’m not familiar with LIFX, but i googled real quick, & it just seems to be an LED light bulb. the light box is designed to mimic outdoor light, in terms of brightness & wavelengths(while filtering UV light), so that your brain will respond to it the way it responds to the sun. intervals of light & darkness are how your brain decides when to wake up, & when to feel sleepy, but with the way modern schedules work, we don’t live according to the sun. the light box acts as a substitute sunrise to your brain. it’s not meant to wake you up in the morning, you’re meant to use it within the first hour after waking up(i do it immediately, while i’m still in bed), to tell your brain “it’s time to wake up.” using it consistently at the time you awaken can actually train your brain to awaken at that time, and to get sleepy at a reasonable time. you’re setting your internal clock the way it’s meant to be set. i usually find that within a week or so of consistently using it, i start to wake up a little bit before my alarm time, and to get sleepy at night when i have 6-8 hours until my alarm."
medical_advice,ffh7kyv,t3_etiqo0,1579925362.0,"this won’t help, say, tonight, but one thing i’ve found that helps my circadian rhythms is light therapy, like people use for seasonal depression. verilux has some relatively inexpensive options on amazon, and i swear, a few of days using it for 10-15 mins right after my alarm goes off, and i’m waking up before my alarm. 
i keep it on my nightstand. i set my alarm a little early, and just flick it on as soon as i shut off my alarm. i browse on my phone for 10-15 minutes(so as not to stare directly into it), then go on about my day. if i slack off using it too long, my sleep cycle can slip after a while has passed, but otherwise it works perfectly. i could go into the neurophysiology of why, but basically it works on your brain like the sun. it sets your circadian rhythms, improves your mood, and(for me) makes me feel more energetic/ready to start the day. i even feel sleepy at a reasonable time of night, which hadn’t happened since i was a kid. it won’t get you to sleep tonight, but since this is an ongoing problem for you, i thought i’d share."
