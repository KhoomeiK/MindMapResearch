running,fr2w0a8,t3_gm6bl5,1589844980.0,Most times - a run in a nice summer drizzle or even in a downpour has been one of the best / most needed runs for me.  It’s like a whole different feeling of accomplishment.   Also.  Running in the rain makes your run 20% more badass.
AmItheAsshole,fr1nxss,t3_gm385e,1589822992.0,Good for you OP.  Doxxing is never cool.  But controlling another adult that willingly moved in with you and then employing a false apology about it?  That’s serious start of red flags.  Excellent choice to get out of there.
xxfitness,fquyyj6,t3_gkuvle,1589666684.0,"My friend always had a nutrgran bar or equal before the run.  I used to do an eggo waffle with honey.  You could always do raisins and or peanuts... 

Ultimately, it’s all about testing to see what sits well and what makes you feel heavy or sick.    I used to have waffles with peanut butter and jelly without issue...   

I got used to real foods while running ultras and now it’s like almost nothing bothers.  But I have learned that you want to stick to foods that can break down easily so it won’t sit in your stomach and give you cramps/ upset stomach etc.  

I use crank nutrition as my “gu” on runs, and if I’m feeling hungry at the start of a long run I’ll shoot one of those and have even felt comfortably fed at the end of runs with those. 

Good luck!"

So. She should know better, and acting out like that is straight-up being a petulant child.  She needs to seriously grow up and, since she’s bored, she can learn to do something like cook or start cleaning the home for you - basically, she should become useful.  

On the home thing though, you may want to check the laws.  In my state, once someone moves in and resides in a place (either for an extended, and admittedly arbitrary amount of time, or they start receiving mail there, or they share some amount of cost of living there... for examples) it doesn’t matter if their name is on the lease, it is considered their residence and it will take an eviction procedure to force them to leave.  You want to look into this bc if things fall apart and she refuses to leave, you may be on the hook to get her out of there legally and she can make life hell for you.  Being on the lease means that the Managment can remove you for violating the lease agreement, but they would have to evict her as well.  ....  again...   check the laws where you live, bc that is how it goes in my state.  I have consulted loads of people in a similar situation."

the important thing is to start sipping water into your system.  And be careful. Dehydration can become a serious thing and affect other organs. Try to hydrate well before and after runs.  There’s tons of writing and research on hydration for runs, take some time and read up a bit.

running,fplma5z,t1_fpllcey,1588715281.0,"So.  It took a while for the bike cardio to feel as good as road cardio, esp since I have it up on the trainer for indoor riding right now - but I made a habit of throwing on a TV show or movie and just zoning out or making up sprint / hill / easy ride games for what I was watching to keep it interesting. 

For weight - I use the nike training club app.   Surprisingly useful and can be used at home or in a gym.  The free version has been great, and during the pandemic they have had their premium portion available for free as well.  Highly recommend for starting out and since gyms are still closed (at least where I am)."
running,fpld7kq,t3_gdxppk,1588710614.0,"I was going through something similar, especially over the last year and a half. 

TL/DR:  My honest opinion is that you might have overtraining issues right now, and your best bet would be to pick up a couple new cardio workouts and work on balancing out and strengthening the weak points you described/have noticed.  And. Just take some time off. Set your sights on two or so months without running - only go out if you want. And don’t use the watch.  Just go until you feel done and be very breezy about it. Plan on starting back from basics and don’t hang on the metrics of pace or distance during your set “down time”. 

For my experience, In similar issues: I trained for a Mountain ultra - mostly by doing stairs/stair climbers/vertical miles, speed hiking training, and just.... not really running.  All because early on in the training I forced myself through a 20 mile sufferfest and then couldn’t walk, let alone run, for about three weeks bc of periformis pain.  so much so that I started to fear being on roads to run more than a mile.

Thanks to weekly visits with an ART therapist and the non-traditional race training (uphills didn’t bother it, and I could go longer on trails without pain) I finished the race and loved it, but could tell I could have used more run time.   

I decided to take the months following the race off running entirely - I’d run if I wanted to, but only then.  The plan was to pick up training for marathons again in the new year, but stronger.  I rode my bike, started a weight training program, joined a boxing club....  dropped about 20 lbs of weight and have finally hit my fitness/physique goals.....  and I have not looked back.  The race was mid September, and since then until  this April, my longest runs were about 5 miles or so.   I get out for a 5k maybe once every other week now and it matches my speed from my more competitive 5k times before I lost my energy.  Recently I did a virtual half marathon (race I originally signed up for) and a virtual marathon (meh, mostly walking - it didn’t matter and I wasn’t into it - and there was no social aspect to get me into it so - meh). And honestly.  I prefer to be on the bike now. 

Basically, even with this time off, My run fitness is there - I’m not going for Boston, sure, but the runs have been fun and I didn’t have to stop almost every mile bc it felt like I was dragging 60lbs in my legs with every step.   I can hit distances and do not feel undertrained.  

Good luck!"

Maybe back in the day it was taboo to get professional help, but that is not the mindset anymore.  I highly recommend finding a good local psychologist who has some other first responders as patients.  

Also. For your peace of mind a little of what my husband has started referring to as “MASH humor” will definitely go a long way in helping break your thoughts out of the cycle.  I had a murder suicide that was done via death bags, dunno why that one got into me, but I didn’t get the time to decompress or break it down to nothing before going into the family life. I practically went from working late on that scene to my brother in law’s pre-wedding family dinner and practice evening and I was surrounded by people who get horrified at the most basic every day occurrences I deal with - so I couldn’t talk about what was on my mind but I wasn’t able to just skip the event either.  I showed up late and got bothered by a sister-in-law to share about my day.  So I finally did. Talking about the helium bags and the positions of the bodies.  My husband then broke me out of it by asking, in all seriousness: “how’d you get the bodies off the ceiling”.  (Implies they were like helium balloons). Ergo.  MASH humor: making light of something otherwise morbid or haunting. Sometimes this is what is needed to take the power out of the thoughts.  

Good luck, friend."

I recommend: Go to have fun.  Try to run as long as you can without hurting yourself or stopping, and then you’ll have a baseline.

bodyweightfitness,fnlnmep,t3_g2f2k6,1587056591.0,"Smh.  People cannot figure out the basic of encouraging the behavior they actually want to see in people.  And. My experience, people like to put others down and undermine achievements, rather than applaud and encourage them.  My family was very renowned for this to me. And, since I cut ties with the whole family about 4 years ago, I have zero contact with them and I.  Am. Happy. For. It. 

One example, and then the advice. I was running marathons.  I could do 26.2 miles in a PB of 3:43:30.  Not groundbreaking. I’m well aware.  Not winning the whole thing. Don’t worry, my dad made sure to let me know that.  But I was proud of myself. It was the best I had done. In fact, that year I had a mile best of 5:31, took first in my age group in multiple 5k’s, including a pB time of 20:33 in the 5k before my best marathon. And I took 3rd female overall in my first attempt at 50k the following January.  In the midst of that, my brother delighted in telling my parents my times before I ever got through the finishing shoot so that when I called to give the requested update (which had to include if I have hurt my knees yet - bc running will destroy my knees and I’m an idiot for doing it) the response is “oh rick already told us how you did - do your knees hurt?  Are you going to eat a burger now?  You shouldn’t eat so much”.   My sister invited everyone over to swim at her in-laws during that summer.  She saw me in my swimsuit (my whole family is majorly obese, and everyone but the kids were wearing oversized shirts and just sitting eating chips instead of swimming) and immediately started pinching my love handles and commenting loudly and disgustedly about how “with all that running you’d think you would actually loose weight. Weird that you’re still so fat”.  Then berated me for ages about how I eat too much and I need to stop running bc of how bad for me it is. 

Anyway.  I cut ties. In the end even with being out of there, seeing them on holidays or short visits hit me in a bad way mentally, even if they didn’t attack me personally for something (which, honestly only happened two times) it still left me feeling drained and shitty.  So I bailed entirely.  And it doesn’t seem as though they have noticed or cared. 

For working out on the DL.  Now is the time to be creative. Becoming “forgetful” so you have to go up and down the stairs a bunch of times.  Doing the classic body weight workouts - chair dips, squats, mountain climbers, pushups, the various crunches - these are all good and equate to building muscle and burning calories.  

For the weight: You need to watch your diet.  Cut back on the meals and make healthy snacks. Grazing works for me, but may not do it for you to keep calories at a 100 or so deficit for the day. You will have to play around with stuff and figure out what does it for you.   Cut the carb stuff way down. Give yourself a “cheat day” once a week and avoid the sweets and heavy foods the rest of the days. Increase water and eat fruits and veggies. Meat is fine, but cut that portion down. Make sense?  

Good luck, friend."

running,fnl644w,t3_g27ymw,1587047725.0,"Hey friend! 

TL/DR:  find a couch to 5k beginner or intermediate program free online and give that a try.  At same time, start cutting calories and carbs down. 


Best advice I’ve ever gotten on this is to remember that most weight loss is based on eating right and keeping your portion sizes smaller. Running won’t cause weight loss, it’ll improve mood and fitness and help with balancing your calories in/out. 

So.  Cut your carbs way down, not completely out (esp at first) add more veggies, choose lean proteins and eat healthy snacks. 

For running: remember that most injuries runners get by doing too much too soon or going too fast too soon. When I started out I was hyper-focused on distances and was always fighting tendinitis.  I recommend starting out by time.  First week or so run 3 times/week for about 15 minutes.  If that feels too much/ you feel too sore/ you are tired the third day of it then take a break and do something else (ie pushups/body weight training or ride a bike). 
Do not feel pressured to run the whole time. You can take walk breaks as you learn your body’s limits for starting out.   There are tons of articles on how to start out, pacing, finding coaches, blah blah blah.   

I recommend finding a “couch to 5k” training plan for beginners and see how that fits your style/body.  If it works. Go through it. Those are usually really great for starting out.  I’m not sure about your martial arts style, but mine was great for body strength and not so great for cardio.  So you may find that your body is capable of going longer than your lungs.  Once you develop a good idea of what your limits are, then you can start pushing through more and more (probably take about 3-5 weeks, depending on your style of workout). 

Lastly: It’s a good goal, but make sure it’s for you not to appease or get your classmates to lay off.  The first will stick, the latter will make you miserable while you run. 

I said a lot, I know. Sorry, not sorry.  Good luck!"
artc,fn7m4nl,t3_fzycs8,1586723076.0,"Omg.  One of my running group friends keeps posting and trying to “bait” others to come out and run with him, and then posts guilt live streams from his solo runs about how people aren’t living their lives and so on and so on. And I just want to drive out to the coffee shop he keeps sitting out side of “because the chairs are still there and he can socialize for a while” and lunch him.  A lot of people in my group are healthcare and/or first responders - not all, many are off work right now and don’t want to waste money on coffee shop food and coffee.... among disrespecting the sacrifice the rest of us have to make to deal with this pandemic.  For the most part, where I am I only see group photos of four or five people bc a couple running together would spot someone else out running with their family and they’ll do a “distanced” post and go on.  Thankfully, my running group has done a pretty good job keeping things separate.  It’s just this one guy who keeps acting like this whole thing is NBD.   🙄🙄🙄"
mypartneristrans,fmqyob1,t3_fwwoxz,1586309932.0,"Ok.  So I get where you are because I fear my husband wanting to go beyond where my natural attractions and desires are and that is terrifying in a relationship that you actually love being in. I get you.  You are also probably feeling grief, depending on how new all of this is and that is normal.  
You already know the right answer - open and honest communication. I always worry that I will hurt my husband, break their heart, if I say what’s really in my mind about my fears or my preferences. But my husband has made the concept clear: that we are both in this together and that we are changing together, so it’s only fair that I get to voice and have an opinion in what that means too.  You and your SO deserve to have the same open communication, especially if the goal is to remain together throughout, then your opinions have to be taken into account too. Hopefully your partner understands this too.  

I say that in the next day or two you and your partner are going to have to have an ugly cry and honest conversation about this step and how it’s affecting you and what their plans are   It has to happen. Bc it’s not healthy for either of you not to have that. Good luck, friend. Feel free to message me if you want to talk.  I’m not perfectly through this, but I went through the messy cries for a month and I realize that the message that is common to get at this stage is too cookie-cutter to be useful."
AdvancedRunning,fmiexkg,t3_fvbgx4,1586108219.0,"It only matters if the profile of your race has elevation changes significant, and you care to PR or compete.  Elevation is good for building speed too and, I find, avoiding injury. 

Full disclosure, I’m pretty biased toward hills:  I love hills.  I eat hills for breakfast and dinner.  I have taken the lead and kept it in many 5ks because of the hills. I train specifically to be faster on hills....  I was running with a couple different groups and it seemed like they were holding to the low-lands/mostly flat areas of town (either for speed or ease of distance)... it turns out with all that flat running I developed an injury that only really strikes me if I spend too much time running flat. If I hit hills or go to trails I don’t get bothered by it at all."

xxfitness,fm2jxb0,t3_fsn93j,1585698987.0,"Just be careful.  Pack a book bag with water, some spare cash, and some snacks.  And, sure?  Go walk, friend.  I wouldn’t do 5 hours the first day.  Maybe an hour and if feeling good, hour and a half.   Then build up to the five or more hours.  I also wouldn’t go out every day to start.  See how you’re feeling. Cus you don’t want any overuse injuries.  

Make sure you’ve got good / comfy and a little worn in shoes. And good socks. You don’t want blisters.  

Go by feel the first week or so.  Feeling run down, go slower and stop earlier.  Feeling really strong?  Go longer or tackle a hill for a view.  

Be safe!  Keep yourself hydrated!  During and after!  

Cheers!"
AdvancedRunning,flofyfu,t3_fq1e3e,1585337554.0,"Early runs are the best - especially during the hot summer months!  My schedule changed a year ago for work, and I had to go from morning running to evening running. It’s a different kind of training for sure, given that I find I have to mind my nutrition and hydration better throughout the day, and if it was a taxing shift (I work 12 hour shifts) then it’s a lot harder to motivate to run and my consistency suffered a lot. Esp in winter when it got dark before I got home.  

I’ve also done some time doing the two-a-day training, which can be heavy but I found it to be very useful (I had a coach for that time who guided that part of my training so I didn’t over do it).  

You could switch up the times of day to run - honestly it’ll help with mental game and can train your body for certain deficits, but at the end of the day stick to what you feel most motivated in doing!  That ensures you’ll actually keep at it. 

Good luck!"

FoodPorn,fl7qnvv,t1_fl7ph0w,1584907319.0,"They are amazing!  

Sorry, but I used the recipe once, found it watery and bland and have just used it for a guide to build these by since.  The idea is to have the tots dry enough that they are solid after baking, but not so dry that they fall apart. I’ve included amounts as a starter guide, but you’ll start to see how it’s all coming together as you work it.    This is a pretty versatile dish and you can move the flavors however you like. 
 
Shredded and drained zucchini  (abt 2 cups)
Parmesan cheese (abt 2/3 cup) -you’ll want enough for binding, but not so much that it takes over the dish. 
Egg (2)
Bread crumbs (abt 1/2cup) - adjust as needed to get mix to clump together without falling apart 
Onion, diced (abt 1 cup ish) 
Seasonings to taste:
Salt, pepper, garlic
I usually throw in some dry mustard, paprika, and if I want more kick some chipotle pepper.  You do you by taste.  You could also lean into the fresh “green” flavor and do dill, sage, cilantro ...  etc. 

Preheat oven to 400 F. 
Spray cookie sheet with anti stick of choice (you’ll want something with a high smoke point since these go hot and slow on the top rack) 
Ball tots into the preferred size you want.  Try to keep as uniform as you can.  Bigger will go longer, smaller shorter cook.  Spread evenly on cook sheet 
Bake for 18-25 minutes   Check on them and rotate half way through cook. 

They are finished when they’re browned a touch and hold together well. I’ve never had to cook longer than 20 min, but I make mine pretty smallish. 

I tend to mix siracha with a small amount of sour cream and some dill to make a nice dip that goes well with this. 

Hope you like them!"
