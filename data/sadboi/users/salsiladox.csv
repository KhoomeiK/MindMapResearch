After I started having 15-30 min 1-to-1 time everyday, she started acting normally again. I also started doing ""time in"" instead of ""time outs"" where I would set a timer for two minutes and she would sit in my lap and I would sing to her or cuddle. Sometimes she would kick me or pinch me cause she was still tantruming (I put her in her crib for two minutes then did a time in period) but as soon as I started doing something with her she WANTED or LIKED (singing for example) she would calm down. It went on like this the first couple of months but pretty soon my DD and DS were more used to everything. So give it time! 

P.S. You're not a bad parent for being angry or frustrated or impatient.  You're going your best!

I've fallen asleep watching TV in the past, with the volume down low and subtitles on so I have to concentrate on the words or I'm lost. 

Also, having white noise in the background (like a fan) helps me for some reason."

JUSTNOMIL,ewir2sy,t3_cog65c,1565455081.0,"My daughter was pretty neutral about my JNmom at first and then LO started crying whenever she'd hold her from 6 months on. My JNmom was convinced they couldn't have a relationship and now doesn't try to interact with her other than putting JNmom's phone in LO face or trying to give LO sweets. When I told her I didn't want LO to eat sweets or be on JNmom's phone, she agreed with me until my back was turned then did it anyway. My husband got on to JNmom. We didn't see her for four weeks after that. Claimed we weren't letting her be a grandma. Yet she won't play with LO on the floor with her toys or go outside with her? She won't even let me bring a pack n play to her house for LO to take naps in because JNmom claims there's always someone to hold her. As a result we never come over! It's just too stressful because I just end up holding her the whole time and never get to eat or play cards with my brothers.

She currently isn't talking to us because we wouldn't let her come inside because LO was sleeping. Last time she did she was loud ON PURPOSE so LO would wake up. As a result, LO was cranky and don't want to be held by JNmom."

I'm hoping I can be at ease with him. Usually I go for an older woman but, since I'm having problems with my mom, I'm steering clear just in case I relapse. This proposed therapist is a male in his early 30s, which fits my husband's age and gender. I hope that helps me feel more comfortable."

adhdwomen,evrtd7y,t3_ckwoua,1564717910.0,"That was my whole 2016. I was finishing my degree, house was FILTHY, my dog was diagnosed with heart disease, my therapist and med provider both left the area, my parents started shunning me, and my spouse and I were having trouble getting pregnant.

I felt like, if I didn't push all my feels deep deep down, I would drown. I became a robot. My spouse and I started fighting a lot. (We eventually agreed to weekly date nights. This helped so much.)

I am also autistic and it's really easy for me to detach. I have to actively reattach. It's exausting.

But you're not weird! It's very common."

For ME:
Weight: No change
Appetite: No change
Libido: Decrease in sex drive
Sleep: Better sleep habits

There is actually a test you can take where they swab your saliva and see what medicines my body is most receptive to. It's for anxiety and depression, but it might be worth talking to your Dr about. It's called GeneSight."
