LeopardsAteMyFace,fpvgxzz,t1_fpvgwhc,1588944533.0,This political comic was originally made for the Supreme Court justice who was accused of sexual assault. It has been edited to remove the Republican parties logo on the cuffs - poorly - and attempt to have conservatives feel like their rights are being attacked by the COVID quarantine. It‚Äôs ironic that it was posted by several conservative people on social media. It may not actually apply to this sub but I thought it was a good fit.

Anxiety,fom4ahq,t1_folgqub,1587877920.0,"I feel this so much, all of these happened to me today. And it sucks when you‚Äôre living with someone who doesn‚Äôt have the same level of hypochondria/anxiety as you. They want to be supportive but they don‚Äôt know how üòì"
teaching,fnh6e5q,t1_fnfkqsz,1586955967.0,"I‚Äôm not saying this doesn‚Äôt happen because it most definitely does but I am a separate class ESE EBD teacher. My students only have me to hear from. I do have a couple students with siblings, so yes they might‚Äôve gotten the other teachers info for their other child but on the whole this isn‚Äôt the case - for my current students at least."
teaching,fnfh7pu,t1_fneiy0h,1586907987.0,"My kids are all EBD actually so I have gotten a few like this too, parent emails just letting me know they are very resistant/non compliant. Not complaining or mad just letting me know. Which is totally fine with me, I‚Äôm not grading anything right now."
teaching,fne6lco,t1_fne5nrg,1586883964.0,"Haha! After posting this I am a lot less annoyed because it has been pointed out that my frustration pales in comparison to what‚Äôs happening, but thank you for making me laugh! :)"
teaching,fne3myi,t1_fne23m8,1586882473.0,"I agree! I love the idea that there are so many ways to connect, in theory it‚Äôs amazing! 
But if I have to call, text (I would never with my own phone), email your work address, email your personal address, Class Dojo message, Remind message, zoom, FaceTime and post on a virtual classroom for you to respond that‚Äôs asinine. Most of us have a device attached to us, I just wanted one place to post all my info. That‚Äôs essentially my original frustration."
teaching,fne2xa5,t1_fndy08i,1586882117.0,"I think they meant if COVID wasn‚Äôt interrupting all our lives, the students would be at school doing at least 5 hours of work. I assume that‚Äôs what they meant."
teaching,fne2mbu,t1_fndlrlq,1586881965.0,"I did know this but I had not actually put that notion into my head when thinking about my current students parents. Thank you, like I said in a previous comment this post has humbled me & I was already sympathetic/understanding to what parents has to go through right now but some things I just hadn‚Äôt actually thought about."
teaching,fne2075,t1_fndt2gc,1586881655.0,"I am sorry about the nasty emails :( that is not cool. I am grateful to not have rude comments by any of them yet, two have gotten annoyed with my constant emails & tech issues but I‚Äôll take that any day."
teaching,fndlkv1,t1_fndkm41,1586872718.0,Thank you for this. I just wanted to vent but after getting a few responses I was not expecting I am a bit humbled.
teaching,fndl5q8,t1_fndkhqk,1586872461.0,"I suppose an example would‚Äôve helped. And this now seems like a very ‚Äústupid‚Äù thing to be upset over but I just wanted the parents/guardians to use the same way to contact me. My district has asked us to use Microsoft Teams. It is installed (I have no idea if that‚Äôs the correct term) into every single students personal portal. If you have internet you have this app. I just want to email everyone at the same time through this one app but I cannot get like 3 parents to commit to using it. Instead they use Class Dojo. It‚Äôs not the end of the world, I just have to send out mass messages sometimes and it would be nice if they were on the same platform. So I set up very step by step instructions and individualized for each family. I do have some ESOL kids too so that maybe where my actual issue is."
teaching,fndjtba,t1_fndiq12,1586871631.0,"I guess I should have explained what I was frustrated with, I am just ranting about a few minor things that I suppose I should have kept inside haha but I agree I should be upset with the district for relying so heavily on technology when my title 1 school might not have been ready for it."
teaching,fndjazb,t1_fndf8zz,1586871308.0,"Wow that was not what I expected. First I assumed this sub was for teachers, second I also assumed this was a safe place to say I was a tiny bit frustrated. Third, my expectation is extremely low. I teach kids with disabilities. I am sorry that you took my personal frustration so seriously and personally. I hope your kids teacher is not piling on the work for your kids. I am sympathetic to everyone‚Äôs plight.

Small edit: I did NOT go to school to learn how to teach kids. My degree is in something else. So this is new to me, not just the distance learning."
OrlandoJobs,fdc4u12,t3_ekk3f9,1578267130.0,"Applied Behavior Center for Autism Oviedo, they are always hiring for substitute positions which is great for students & a lot of people transition to full time after they graduate. You don‚Äôt already need to be a Registered Behavior Technician, if you become full time they will help you get that. It‚Äôs a certificate. I think it‚Äôs a great post under grad job. Good luck!"
waiting_to_try,fd61r6v,t1_fd4uzlf,1578184335.0,"Thank you! I am so excited to start in a few weeks :) and I‚Äôm glad people pointed out that a brand new baby doesn‚Äôt need their own room, I was in a fantasy bubble and thinking when you have a baby in the Sims LOL  you guys have made me feel better , so thank you! :)"
waiting_to_try,fd61bv8,t1_fd5cx9h,1578184162.0,That‚Äôs a great point! I was thinking ‚Äúoh no my baby won‚Äôt have their own room at one week old!‚Äù lol they‚Äôll never know

I think at this point budgeting & better money management is going to be the starting point for us, and hopefully I‚Äôll get lucky too and get a better job! :)"
AskReddit,f4k2dat,t3_dko28q,1571632889.0,"I would probably be able to save some money from each paycheck instead of barley making it stretch across all my bills & be able to not stress every single week if we can make the car payment, or the rent or the utilities or even have money for lunch. It would be a tremendous help honestly."
