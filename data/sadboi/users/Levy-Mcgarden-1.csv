SuicideWatch,ev8en9q,t3_c34ko8,1564277320.0,"I need to ask advice i know this may sound silly because i'm 13 but,i need this because i'm trying to do a lot of research before i do this. I want to break up with my boyfriend we've been together for almost a year and everytime we ever talk about what would happen if the break up occured he would say something along the lines of suicide and that would honestly guilt trip me a lot to the point where i just try to ignore me wanting to break up so he won't hurt himself. It is a long distance relationship and i've been having these thoughts for a couple weeks. It's where to the point where i want to like take a nap or i'm busy something along the lines of i can't talk right now he puts sad emojis as a way to guilt trip me. We talk a lot and he once asked me to take a picture of myself and send it to him and i said 'No i'm honestly not comfrontable with taking pictures of myself' after i said that he changed my contact name to 'My ex' just to guilt trip me into sending a picture of myself and he always calls me mean and a bit*h because i don't do what he wants. So if i break up with him and he comites suicide would i be at fault?"
