mentalhealth,fpr0v7r,t1_fpqsft2,1588838451.0,"Hey, thanks for your reply! 
1- i try to use the same technique, but instead i have balloons that float away :)
2- in cbt i learnt to look at and write down whats upsetting me and pick it apart, like the causes, the true/false of the situation and really strip it down to the cause thats upsetting me. It works, but sometimes when im really upset its hard to implement these techniques.
3- i have tried quite a few medications, the side effects were too significant to keep taking them. I have promethazine (anti anxiety/sleeping pill) as PRN for whenever I need. I take when needed but it makes me a little sleepy.

Honestly i think in general i have some pretty good coping strategies in place, and always end up okay. Just when i have these ‘down’ days it feels so so bad in the moment.

Thanks for your Ideas! Im gonna dig out my old DBT workbook and have a look through :)"
mentalhealth,fpi2z8r,t3_gdkp0h,1588632643.0,"Hey, I know this probably isn’t the answer you’re looking for but If it could help its worth a shot. I used to self harm pretty bad, but i realised its the actual shock of the pain/sensation that stops my body from being into panic mode and helps being me back to earth. After realising this, i tried to think of other ways to induce that ‘shock’ feeling without actually hurting myself. 

The best way i found, is using ice. I would get ice cubes out of the freezer, and squeeze them in my hands (started to get a little numb) and it would really help me to ground myself down. Then i started to either splash my face with freezing water or have a cold shower instead. These all really worked for me, and now I haven’t self harmed for a long time. 

Im not saying this will cure your mental health, it just could be worth a try as the methods of self - harm you were discussing can be very dangerous.

Whatever you decide to do, please stay safe. Drop me a message if you need someone to talk to!"

I feel you should have a chat with him and explain the situation, and also make it clear to him that it is all cleared up now and let him know that you want to get it on again!!

Sometimes you have to take a step back and try to think logically,
We are all just humans
Who is to say that one persons words are any more meaningful than someone else’s
We all mean something
We’re all here for a reason. 
You do have worth.

You need to try to believe in yourself, and be more confident. I get it’s so so hard but you need to try. 

Maybe try with a small social interaction each day, you never know you could make friends from it. Like compliment someone’s outfit, or say good morning to a stranger. Smile at someone on the bus. Little things, even if you don’t keep in contact with the person can make you feel that little bit less lonely. 

Also, If you have hobbies try to find locql groups or clubs for those hobbies, that what you can get to know people in a controlled environment and it won’t be as awkward because naturally you have something in common to talk about.

Watch your favourite show
Draw
Play a game
Clean your room / house 
Talk to someone 
Watch YouTube / something that makes you laugh 
Go for a walk (if it’s safe to do so)
Exercise 

If you feel like you need to relax try to look up mindfulness/ meditation. There’s plenty of videos and books to help :)

It’s a really small gesture but it shows you’re thinking of the future. I feel that the other comments are right in saying you’re probably still in the ‘honeymoon’ , you need to fully know what you’re getting yourself into and aswell if you propose too early she might think you’re not being serious or get freaked out that it’s too early so think about her reaction too.

I remember that on a daily basis as it really helps. But seriously, I have been to physical rock bottom , hospitalised for suicide attempts and I genuinely thought it would never get better. I’d fucked my education and had no friends. Now 4 years later I have a long term partner, a great friendship circle and am going back into education, I hope this helps you realise that there is Definately hope for you, just remember if you’ve been to the bottom the only way is up, I hope you find hope soon.

Be to do it, then evaluate if it’s worth your time and money. We all want people like this to be put away, just make sure you don’t harm yourself even more in the process. I think just consult, evaluate your options then you can make a better informed choice"

Advice,erywr51,t3_c4y2bd,1561419531.0,"If I were you I’d move If you can afford to, you’re being taken advantage of and I’m sure you can find somewhere with a landlord that cares about it’s tenants. If you really don’t want to move I suggest reporting him to authorities as I’m sure there’s certain laws about the standards of living accommodations ( I’m not an expert so you’d have to look into it .) lastly I know he took you in however that doesn’t give him an excuse to treat you badly now, at some point you have to stand up for yourself friend or not.

Advice,erytthb,t1_erysbwk,1561417274.0,"I think tomorrow I’m going to see him, lay it all on the table and really try to understand the reasoning behind why these patterns exist. I do think age can be a massive part of it and I get that he needs to go and live his life, I think we need to just find the right balance and compromise, if we can do that I really believe we can be together happily.

Advice,erytih1,t3_c4vugo,1561417042.0,"From the sounds of how you talk about the two in comparison I’d say go for the film major, as you can clearly see your excitement talking about it. I had the same dilemma as I was extremely interested in law and would of loved to learn about it, however upon completion of the education I don’t think I would of ever seen myself in that profession, after that I followed my gut and went for the subject that excites me. Just make sure before you make your decision you comsider all of the options (maybe a pros and cons list) and be aware that there could be down sides to studying film and there is a possibility you may not intern with marvel ( not trying to rain on your parade) don’t let your parents influence you too much though. As much as you care about their happiness yours should come first"
Advice,eryt1ey,t3_c4w18s,1561416688.0,"I’d Definately get in touch with a helpline, I’m from the uk so I’m not sure if we will have different services but a quick google search should bring up results, in the uk we have ‘samaritans’ which can help a lot of people struggling. Be open and honest with them and they can refer you to the right teams or help, you will probably have an assessment and then may receive counselling or medication. It can be a long process but the quicker you get the ball rolling the quicker you will get the help you deserve. 
I really do hope you receive help as I have struggles myself and I know it can get hard as you get older, and feels like there’s less support around. Feel free to message me if you would like to talk, I’ll give any advice I have."
Advice,eryspkz,t3_c4w4fn,1561416446.0,"I think the best course (even if a bit manipulative) is to make the best friend feel like she’s doing a massive favour to you for driving herself , even through realistically she should just grow up and do it, but telling her she should do it and she’s being selfish etc will make her want to do it even less, and if it means a lot to your girlfriend to have you both there the best way to go about it is peacefully, once you’re there you can forget about it and all have fun. Just make her think she’s the ‘hero’ and nobody could of gone without her, even if that’s the complete opposite of what you think"
Advice,eryrwri,t1_eryqs0i,1561415854.0,"I understand what you’re saying completely, however the reason this whole thing confuses me is because he is so loving and caring, honestly it’s felt like the honeymoon period since the start, it’s  just the talking and communication he seriously struggles with, in every other aspect he’s a great partner, so this makes it hard for me to not want to make an attempt to improve things. As I said to another commenter this isn’t every day this is happening, it’s so hit or miss with him which is why it’s a tough decision to make :( I’ve seen the side of him that does listen, care and make changes so I know it’s possible, but I know that eventually if things don’t change it will have to come to an end. Thank you for your advice, every different outlook is helpful to me as I’m really trying to consider what to do from different points of views"
Advice,eryri70,t1_eryq5id,1561415549.0,"In terms of the staying over, I feel that he acted a bit drastically when saying that and I know he doesn’t mean it, the worry is more in the fact he can’t just keep going to the worst case scenario when he’s not feeling good, he should talk to me and make compromise.  For example, if I stay over once and he feels a bit stressed out his first decision is to never stay over again, rather than saying ‘let’s just give it a break for a week and then go back to normal’ this is what I mean by acting drastically. 

In terms of losing interest, it is well a possible option however he seems to get really upset when I tell him I’m not feeling stable or happy with something which leads me to believe he does care and he doesn’t want that. Bit he has serious trouble expressing how he feels so he’d rather shut off and not talk about it.

He has mentioned to me that he feels stable and he doesn’t think there’s anything wrong and he wants a future, however he refuses to acknowledge that the way he acts doesn’t make me feel the same. 

To answer your other questions, I do try to stand my ground however I find it hard to say things that hurt people so I guess I can sugarcoat things sometimes. I don’t encourage the behaviour and I always call him out on it and I regularly check up on how he’s feeling about the pace of the relationship. 
To me communication is key so I make a lot of effort to express feelings and talk.

I want to stand my ground more, but the next level would be not talking to him for a while (having a break) and I worry that may ruin things completely.  Any advice of other routes to go when talking to him would be so helpful.

Also thank you for your reply, you are seriously good at giving advice"
Advice,eryqpkt,t1_erypqvg,1561414965.0,"Because this comes on in ‘bursts’ as to say, so things will be good for maybe 6 months and when I say good I mean man of my dreams good but then out of no where he acts like this which doesn’t make me feel secure in the relationship as I don’t know when or why it is happening. There is times I’ve got through to him and when he actually takes time out to listen and make compromises he is so great, but it’s getting him to realise that he can’t just pick and choose when he wants to be that perfect boyfriend, everyone has off days but I’ve started to notice a pattern and I’m trying to understand why and break the pattern before it gets too far. 

I appreciate honestly and you’ve been helpful showing me an outsiders perspective"
Advice,eryqdxz,t3_c4wo7k,1561414730.0,"Let him know in a calm manner, show him it’s genuine concern for his daughter otherwise you may be perceived as the ‘crazy ex’ ( sorry to say that) but Definitely you should say it, maybe even just as a polite message on social media, and point out to him if he doesn’t believe you there is ways to contact the police and find out for himself."
Advice,erypybj,t3_c4wpuu,1561414416.0,"As a female, my first date was a movie and then food after, this is a great idea as you get to chat a little bit before the movie, then after the movie you both have something in common to talk about plus while In there you can put your arm Round her, cuddle up or even hold hands depending on how comfortable you are. It’s Definately a good idea to do something after a movie though so you can spend more time getting to know each other but If there’s a awkward silence or you don’t know what to say you can bring up the movie. 

In terms of how to act, don’t be cocky, it’s nice for a few cheeky jokes but not too often, be polite, compliment them and make sure you listen!!! In general just be polite and a gentleman while being yourself :) hope this helps"
