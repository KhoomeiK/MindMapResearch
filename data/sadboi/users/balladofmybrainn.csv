ADHD,fqtodv8,t3_gklyer,1589642923.0,"I can recite songs perfectly after just a few times hearing them but I absolutely cannot remember movie lines for the life of me. I know almost every actors name ever, but sometimes in the moment I won‚Äôt remember and it‚Äôll take me 5 minutes even if I know I know it. My boyfriend has ADD too and he knows EVERY LINE and he‚Äôs great with song lyrics too.

I hate the fact that when I am asked what my favourite song is, I freeze up and can‚Äôt think of it - even if a few days ago I said ‚Äú____ is my favourite song.‚Äù I guess my memory in a quick second is not great. Even this one band I love and I have seen in concert, for some reason their name I cannot remember for the life of me every time I go to mention them."

relationships,fqln76m,t3_gjj205,1589462148.0,"When I was 18, my boyfriend and I at the time were having sex on his couch. His mom wasn‚Äôt supposed to come home at that time but did. The way the townhouse worked is there is the front door/kitchen, dining room and living room but there‚Äôs a clear path/view from the front door to the living room. Instead of, I don‚Äôt know, throwing a blanket over my naked body or trying to throw my clothes on quickly I decided it would be a good idea to grab my clothes and run past her view from the front door and up the stairs. Horrible idea because A. She saw my naked ass body and B. I slipped and put my knee through her wall next to the stairs. Thank god for adrenaline cause I barely felt it - although I had a huge bruise afterwards. She then proceeded to come upstairs, where I was hiding in the bathroom, and sternly say ‚Äúhere you go‚Äù with my thong in hand. I mean afterwards was definitely the worst, especially since I put a hole in her wall. But I dunno after a while it didn‚Äôt matter and I was able to look her in the eye."

LifeProTips,fqgc7hk,t3_gii0je,1589342654.0,"I can‚Äôt explain how AMAZING this is, especially for someone with ADD/ADHD who forgets everything. It feels so good to know you aren‚Äôt forgetting any important appointments, birthdays,  cancellations you need to make etc. Your brain feels so much more calm when you aren‚Äôt constantly trying to remember shit."
trichotillomania,fqdn0pp,t1_fqc6a8w,1589292975.0,I am so glad this was helpful for you!!
trichotillomania,fqbz42d,t1_fqbwiu1,1589246800.0,I am so happy this was helpful for you!! I definitely  thought it was interesting and very informative. I agree with it being a good way to get others around you to understand better. My boyfriend gets so agitated with all the pulling cause my hair is EVERYWHERE in our apartment.
Anxiety,fqa5onn,t3_ghiqy2,1589213274.0,"Definitely! Especially interactions with my boss at work. I constantly replay it in my head and feel shame and guilt for maybe not saying the right thing. I have to really talk to myself and say ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, nothing bad is going to happen.‚Äù So I will stop thinking about it."

relationships,fp5wrh3,t3_gbcucj,1588341572.0,"I was dating a really shitty guy, who didn‚Äôt deserve me at all, on and off for 3.5 years. My friend messaged me one day with his Plenty of Fish account. It was all information that was pretty recent as he had a new hobby. I called him up and say goodbye. Best thing to ever happen to me. Take it as a blessing that your friend found it. You deserve WAY BETTER than someone who treats you as an option. He sucks!!!"
Anxiety,fox19vq,t3_g9ulfa,1588131692.0,"Probably the biggest thing that helps me calm my mind. I think uplifting music is great and music you can dance to but I also love the melancholy kind. There‚Äôs an artist called Novo Amor I love, he has such a soothing voice. It‚Äôs the type of music you could drift to sleep with on."
trichotillomania,fox0z8r,t3_ga0qme,1588131497.0,That‚Äôs awesome!! I can‚Äôt wait to get there some day!
Anxiety,fox0xnu,t3_ga04o7,1588131467.0,The sun is literally my saving grace. The summertime is when I am the happiest! Vitamin D is all I want and I will do anything to sit on a patio or be at a pool or the beach. I can‚Äôt waitüò≠
trichotillomania,fox02az,t1_fowisjz,1588130894.0,I agree. I really want to try and make a conscious decision to stop!! We can do it! It‚Äôs not going to be easy of course.
trichotillomania,fowg2c9,t1_fowfpod,1588119075.0,"I saw that one too but hadn‚Äôt read into it!! That sounds awesome that they offer the rental. I wonder if it is rent to own or if you think it would be better to just buy depending on how long you would use it!
Also I feel like I would like the shock vs vibrate because that would associate the habit with pain and I HATE PAIN. I used to chew my cheek but I once chewed so much mindlessly that I injured my jaw muscle and it got locked so I could barely open my mouth for a month. So now when I start I‚Äôm like oh helllllll no and I am able to stop myself really quick."
trichotillomania,fow3uij,t1_fow31j8,1588112512.0,I completely resonate with this. It‚Äôs a lot of money but when you are so desperate to get hours of your day back it‚Äôs almost worth it. I feel like I am not trying hard enough to overcome it lately. My longest amount of time without pulling for the last few months is maybe a few days but that‚Äôs rare. I think I am willing to try anything as well.
trichotillomania,fow0pov,t1_fow05wh,1588110883.0,I totally understand! I feel like these are the sort of things insurance should cover as well. This is not something we all want to buy for fun. I am hoping my health spending account will cover this. Though I understand not everyone has benefits. I work contract so I only just got benefits from my partners job.
trichotillomania,fovzei2,t1_fovyvvc,1588110217.0,There‚Äôs a coupon if you buy two for $30 off it seems but that‚Äôs still so expensive!:(
trichotillomania,fovz1o1,t3_g9tvbb,1588110037.0,"Although I haven‚Äôt followed this advice my therapist told me to keep something in your free hand ie. if you are watching a movie or not on your phone to use like a stress ball so you keep your hand pre-occupied. I should probably get one and listen to her. I have only stopped for long periods of time, 8 months to 1 year, when I have started a new relationship where my stress is low and serotonin is high. I find also texting all the time was helpful keeping my hands busy. But now that I am stuck at home during this pandemic I am constantly pulling because there‚Äôs no one around me to make me wanna hide it."
trichotillomania,fovlomn,t3_g9u2cf,1588103428.0,"And I also see there‚Äôs a brand called Slightly Robot that has a similar product. I already have the app that is supposed to help but I found I wasn‚Äôt keeping track of each time I pulled.
This product is currently on backorder but is $104 US so it‚Äôs a little bit less expensive."
trichotillomania,fovl5ft,t3_g9u2cf,1588103170.0,"Also, I saw a coupon code on this girls YouTube for 10% off ‚ÄúALLIESFRIEND‚Äù Her name on YouTube is Allie Malin."
trichotillomania,flz53fg,t3_frx5t3,1585615704.0,Yep. I am nonstop pulling my hair! My boyfriend is getting annoyed and keeps telling me every time I do it which almost makes me want to pull more. Work is really stressful which is making me want to pull. I didn‚Äôt do it all weekend and right when I started my work day I started again. It‚Äôs definitely the worst it has been in a while.
relationships,fl4uwfx,t3_fmc7q4,1584822045.0,Wooooooow. Both of them are pathetic and don‚Äôt really care about your feelings it seems. You deserve 10000x better than this. This is really hard and I am sorry this happened to you. Trust me when I say someone better will come along that will deserve your supportive and understanding nature AND WILL NOT ABUSE IT. I definitely agree with everyone else the ‚ÄúI need my freedom‚Äù line is the oldest line in the books. He wanted to break it off but didn‚Äôt have the balls.
relationships,fjb26ym,t3_fcew4y,1583185041.0,"Short: If he doesn‚Äôt feel he wants to say it he probably doesn‚Äôt feel it anymore. If you love someone you may not say it all the time like my boyfriend and I (50x per day) but you should probably at least say it once per day if you do talk every day, I feel...Ie. ‚Äúgoodnight, I love you‚Äù"
trichotillomania,fivm5ax,t3_fa0zwb,1582763118.0,I know it‚Äôs easy to get upset with yourself when your streak comes to an end because it feels like failure but remember that if you did it once before you will do it again!! I hope it helps!!
trichotillomania,fcitczq,t3_egiu2c,1577669338.0,Me too. I started a new relationship in February and I stopped until we moved in together in a new city and I started a new job. My anxiety was through the roof and of course it‚Äôs my coping mechanism. I wish I would have tried harder to stop myself from relapsing. But now it‚Äôs been about 2 months and my hair is so short on one side:( I wish I would just have put my hair up!
