plantclinic,fla5i99,t1_fl8l1wd,1584977060.0,"Thanks! Yea, I should have specified in the post, she told me that I should probably repot her and that she needed help keeping her alive so she trusts me to do what is needed. So she doesn’t know what works best for this plant, according to her she has just been moving her around her home. I remember seeing her pretty healthy at some point, but now half of it is dying? I want to cut her back as well, but that would be like the last option? I want to try and bring it all back first and I would also need like written consent so cut her back, though I’ve been given it cutting back feels way different than repotting."
