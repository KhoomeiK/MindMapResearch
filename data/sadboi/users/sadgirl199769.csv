depression_help,eqsws9l,t1_eqsl8c6,1560295895.0,I'm sorry to hear you can relate. You seem like a strong individual yourself. I admire your spirit a lot!  I just wish I had a direction to go into instead of just feeling like I'm scraping by each day.  Thank you for your kind words.
depression,eqsar6x,t3_bzc9jt,1560280616.0,I feel the same way. This is cliche and probably hypocritical from me but exercising helps a lot with your energy levels to get back to being productive. I am really bad at keeping a habit since it just takes one or two days to kick me off the wagon and then I feel too fatigued to start it up again lol
