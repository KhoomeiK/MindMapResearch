I find it hard to believe that the unannounced visits bring you to this level of upset. I understand that what they're doing is annoying, but I don't think that this is the absolute cause. I understand that you like some privacy with your fiancé and maybe it contributes with that. Do you hate his parents/family? Specifically, why? What did they do to you to act like this?"

AmItheAsshole,fmx6bx0,t3_fxrz45,1586459258.0,"Not a popular opinion but YTA. It's none of your business. It is their relationship, you're not included. If he wanted to tell Triss about it, he will. You can tell Geralt what your opinions are about his action, you may suggest what to do about it. But you should never impose. What you did is that you crossed the line by threatening him and actually intervening in their supposedly private relationship. What you did, obviously did not help and caused a serious  misunderstanding.

If I am in Triss' shoes, I'd like to know, but not from you or anyone else. I'd like to know from my man's own words. I want him to explain it to me, whatever the issue is, if he thinks that it is necessary to be discussed, so that I may understand and weigh the situation. I wouldn't build a home with him in the first place, if i don't trust him well enough.

You see, it's easy to wreck a havoc in a relationship when other people triggers misunderstanding. If words come from a person other than their partner, a person's ego gets hurt and may think that they looked stupid. That's why Triss felt furious about it."

I was a scholar back then yet the subsidy that I get wasn't enough to support my everyday needs like food and lodging. When I already had enough money, I decided to go back to studying and during the interview (because the process requires a lot of interview from people like institute director and college dean), I was asked why I stopped studying. So I told the institute director that I had to since I wanted to save money to support myself. She responded by saying that I'm using poverty in vain.
