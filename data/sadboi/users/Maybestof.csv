This is not so unusual for girls your age to act like that. Many girls in their early twenties are quite insecure and are extremely worried about their boyfriends. 

Does her parents have a good relationship? Are they divorced perhaps? Sometimes this can be projected onto a relationship and she basically thinks if you aren't codependent, she risks loosing you. 

She can't handle you if your attention is outside of her control. I am sensitive guy too and I like to do the right thing and help people out, your situation sounds very familiar. 

I once was helping out a refugee, who fled a middle eastern country due to his homosexuality. He was also some years younger than me, kinda like you. My then girlfriend felt very threatened by him as she couldn't control her thoughts and was scared something going on. 

Sounds like your girlfriend seems to have the same issues, she thinks people with that age difference can't be together unless there is some sexual connection. I doubt my ex or your girlfriend think this 

Don't be too hard on her, this is not so unusual for someone her age. Nowadays girls are pushed to be very strong, independent and able to compete with men in every way. This sometimes results in some girls being extremely afraid of being embarrassed by their spouses and needing to control the relationship as to not end up looking weak and fragile compared to their partner. 

You will have to assure her of your intentions, look her in the eyes and make her believe you are doing what you think is right. Don't talk about the specifics of your relationship with that kid or others, she needs assurance about you and show she can trust you. Maybe there is some reason why she can't trust you, it may or may not be related to you. Good luck man."

That is exactly what they are doing.

France being imperialist and holding their boot down on them and then justifying their actions with the white mans burden trope I think is racist in nature. Just listen to this asshole: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/emmanuel-macron-africa-development-civilisation-problems-women-seven-eight-children-colonialism-a7835586.html

Nobody thinks China is there as saviors. China is only there for the money, they are seemingly using unethical trade practices to gain assets in poor countries. They don't seem to provide aid unless it's a bribe and they provide loans that trap poor countries when they can't pay them back, in short. 

But let me tell you what China hasn't done. They haven't militarily invaded vast areas of Africa, cut regions into countries to best exploit their resource with no care for the nationalities. They didn't create a whole monetary system where the Chinese central bank control the monetary policy and keeps puppet regimes ensuring cash flows back to the motherland.

Sure China is getting in on the action, but it is still very far from what China has been doing so far. This kind of competition between powers can often be very lucrative for developing countries as they will compete for aid and influence. The thing is, France can't compete in the long run.

France does not improve the economic situation, they need to let these countries develop by themselves so they can get sustainable growth and develop a proper lawmaking apparatus. One of the most basic things a country needs to make politics is control of its own economy and money. 

They don't have that because France wants to keep sucking the wealth out and funnel it to France. These countries need these do develop themselves. For every cent France gives to corrupt elites to keep their uneven treaties going, they take a dollar out. 

They are purposefully keeping them poor and many people are wise to it, if I was born in one of those places you bet I would hate the puppet government, maybe even enough to join one of the rebel groups. I can certainly understand why there is so much unrest there. 

I do not think African countries generally want no foreign interference nor is that in their interests, it can be an asset in some instances. But what the French are doing is downright despicable, France is addicted to all the wine and cheese its colonies produces and doesn't want to get off it.

In short, this British mess is starting to drag down the rest of the 27 and the EU as an institution. 

Macron has been championing extensive reform in the EU since the Brexit vote. He wants to use the budget to do this, by slashing the agriculture aid for example. I personally think he wants this to be his political legacy and the Brexit uncertainty is making this difficult.

worldnews,f45m8gi,t1_f44s3sh,1571383591.0,"I would argue that this definition very nicely fits China. 

Perhaps on paper the revolution is over, but that is not what I understand Paxton to mean in this case. He means that the leaders espoute revolutionary slogans and tout the need for revolutionary spirit to complete the revolution. This is very much happening in China now. The need to invigorate the youth with party loyalty, bring in dissidents in Xinjiang, unification with Taiwan and squashing the Hong Kong protests are due to this never ending promise of the successful revolution. 

One symptom of this are the rampant reactionaries online on every national and international event seen as against the Chinese governments goals, or better stated, against the goals of the revolution. I have seen plenty of witch hunts of people being deemed anti-chinese Chinese for not towing the line. 

It is also not uncommen to hear old people in China say ""Communism will be achieved soon!"" Etc."

worldnews,ep4jxx7,t1_ep4bemw,1559041298.0,"Thanks for the reply. I think I do understand, basically what you are saying is that the intentions of the Israeli government are obscure and we don't know why they do what they do. 

Also that this is a poorly debated topic with people just replying emotionally, I totally agree with that! I agree the situation is similar regarding Bibi and Trump in a couple of ways. 

I get that you say people are easily duped and are led by leaders who abuse the system for personal gain. There might be some truth to that, but I also think the truth is that people aren't honest about why they support the leaders they do. And that leaders aren't always honest about their intentions and reasons behind them. 

With regard to Trump, one of the major underlying reasons people like him is that he is a racist. It is pretty blatant, I don't know if you'd dispute that though, and a lot of people in the US are worried about threats to their ethnicity by people they don't understand, non-white immigrants for example. 

It is not my intention to challenge you or something, just curious about your view here.
The reason why I wanted to ask you is because you wrote: 

> The thing that a lot of people fail to see, is that our government's treatment of the Palestinian people is not due to some sadistic hatred.
> 
> I believe people love criticizing us because we are a first world country, so it's easier to communicate with and get proper answers.

You say we don't know the governments reasons or why they do what they do. But you also say it is not because of some sadistic hatred. 

The only logic I can see behind not supporting a two state solution while basically upholding an apartheid system seems to be promoting Jewish ethnicity at the expense of others. I can understand one might want to protect ones ethnic group, but directly promoting it at the expense of a weaker ethnic groups is what the Germans did 80 years ago. Hence the international critique of Israel. 

Israelis seem to generally want to follow this path by keeping Bibi in power, giving him popular legitimacy. Is it then wrong to say Israel, both government and people, is gripped by a hatred and us vs them mentality that can only lead to more hate? Is it wrong to say the Israeli government and people is responsible for this situation since they hold the power and can dictate what happens?"
worldnews,ep48fpt,t1_ep474u7,1559035465.0,"Thank you for your comment, I really sympathize with the situation Israelis live through. I won't pretend to understand what that is like. 

Can I ask you why it is then that the Israeli government does not support a two state solution? Perhaps it is not some kind of sadistic hatred, but the situation in Israel and the illegal settlements just makes people think of Lebensraum and an unwillingness to solve the crisis peacefully. 

Israel should be allowed to keep itself and it citizens safe, but when you have this limbo of Palestinians being treated at second rate citizens at best inside Israel, which from the outside looks like apartheid, is it not understandable the reaction many have against Israel?"
