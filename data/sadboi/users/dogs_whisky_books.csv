TwoXChromosomes,fp514d9,t1_fp4x3gs,1588313000.0,"Uni gives me a lot of support and my bpd is much more manageable than it was even 5 years ago. It's hard af but we can do it  But thank you. I know I'm just a random on the internet, but I am genuinely so pleased for you. You should be so proud of yourself."
TwoXChromosomes,fp4wzib,t3_gb7gua,1588309610.0,I have BPD and I'm currently at uni and struggling. This gives me so much hope that I can get through it. Congratulations and well done! X.
Scotland,fnofptf,t1_fnoepwe,1587123599.0,The bravery you showed eating a baguette in front of the mad Bastards is impressive. I've seen them divebomb cars for food. Take care and stay safe yourself.
Scotland,fnoeh0s,t1_fnoecky,1587122408.0,Haha those seagulls are vicious! Thank you! Got an email today saying term starting in September so I'll hopefully get to come back (relatively) soon. Enjoy the peace and quiet while you can.
Scotland,fnoddem,t3_g2wg2x,1587121310.0,The ducks are always on Market Street. For some reason they stoat about outside the Keys a lot. I miss St Andrews. Had to move home for spring break and I'm genuinely missing just wandering about town. Is nice to see it again.
Scotland,fmtm6g8,t1_fmtfxof,1586375118.0,"Urgh, *nothing* tastes as bad as that off brand fake 'iron brew' you used to get at the school tuck shop (except diet irn bru. That shit is vile also) I adjusted to the new stuff eventually (1st hangover without real irn bru was rough af though) I've no tried the !original recipe' stuff. I dunno if that resembles the old recipe or not. But I do agree that it tastes fuck all like it used to."
Scotland,fmtbu1x,t1_fmtb46m,1586370114.0,"Not *zero* sugar (except diet irn bru, which is rank anyway) but they cut the sugar content by half. You kinda get used to it, but it does fuck all for hangovers now."
AskLiteraryStudies,fm8sac1,t3_ftrbsz,1585855079.0,"'Hypallage-a rhetorical term describing the figure of speech in which the natural relations of words are exchanged, often by placing an epithet in an unusual position eg. In Keat's 'the murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves* (ode to a nightingale) it is actually the flies which are murmurous, and not the haunt. '

*A dictionary of literary terms* by Martin Gray

Hope that helps.

Edit: if you're studying English literature, this book totally helps with identifying devices etc. It's got *everything* listed in it. It might be hard to get hold of but if you try second hand bookshops, they may have a copy hitting about."
BorderlinePDisorder,fm8plhr,t3_ftgpz0,1585853666.0,"It does get better. You just have to keep reminding yourself of that. Especially if you have episodes, which will happen cos BPD is a cunt and it doesn't let go easily. As long as you don't let the episodes make you lose hope, you'll get control of it. I was a mess 5 years ago, but now I'm in uni, I have (healthy) relationships, and my self destructive behaviour is at a minimum. I still get horrible episodes, but I can fight through them now, cos I know they'll pass, whereas before I just felt lost and hurt and scared. You'll get there. If I can start recovering, then believe me, other people can.

 I wish you all the best and I hope you get as much help as you need. 

Just remember that those thoughts in your head and the overwhelming emotions aren't your fault. It's an illness, and it takes time to learn how to cope with it. Take care."
NatureIsFuckingLit,fm6o5ng,t3_ftca2a,1585798714.0,This is reminding me of my home town on a Saturday night. It kinda makes me feel both nostalgic and grateful I'm permanently *not* out to see it.
NotHowGirlsWork,flg9qry,t1_flg8ybe,1585136206.0,Thank you. On both counts :)
Anxiety,flffh0m,t1_flfew3a,1585105236.0,"I was freaked earlier and a redditor advised me to write down things I'm grateful for. Like, anything; the sun shining, seeing a doggie, your family, just anything. I was kinda skeptical, but I tried it and it totally gave me some much needed perspective. The small things are sometimes the best things to remember. I'm sure you will be fine and as I said, you are so much stronger than you think. Distract yourself as much as u can and it might make you relax a bit and calm down the awful voice we get in out heads that *always* predicts the worst X. Take care of yourself and I hope you start to feel better soon x x."
Anxiety,flfegdn,t3_fo6h6w,1585104513.0,"Oh my god yes! I've been getting constant headaches and tightness in my chest and anxiety attacks making it hard to breathe and it is freaking me the fuck out! I have to try and remind my stupid brain that it's anxiety and bpd and not anything more sinister. It sucks and I'm really sorry your experiencing it too. I think people with mental health issues are really gonna struggle with everything at the moment. I really hope you feel better* soon x. If not, try an see/call a doctor and ask for some help X. I feel so selfish feeling like this when everyone is suffering but we can't help it. Take care and I hope you find a way to deal with all this craziness X. I hope we all do X. 

*relatively. It's a freaking rickety rollercoaster at the best of times X. Good luck. 

Just remember, you are stronger than you think, and more capable than you know, and this will eventually pass. We!ll get through it."
NotHowGirlsWork,flfcf2x,t3_fo59f1,1585103083.0,"I am so sick of men telling me I don't have proper hobbies. Apparently reading isn't a hobby. Nor is drawing, Or writing short stories, Or making crafts/painting. The only hobbies they appear to accept are video games an playing some form of sports (with a group of mates, so obvs they 'need' people too)

 it's frustrating and belittling. It suggests that women are incapable of being 'alone' cos 'eMOtiOns'. Pisses me off. Do whatever the fuck you enjoy and let others do the fucking same. Judging and gatekeeping help no one. (unless the gate *needs* keeping. Like labrynth etc obviously.)

(I am so sorry. I'm not sleeping and a lot of things are pissing me off at the moment )"
confidentlyincorrect,flfbilq,t3_foeopl,1585102458.0,"What fucking point is she trying to make? Yeah, it's milder in the under 60's but you can PASS IT ON TO PEOPLE WHO ARE VULNERABLE. that's the fucking point of isolation; *not* to infect those whose immune system *can't* deal with the often deadly fucking virus. I seriously fucking despair of the human race. Especially when evil bints like this, who deliberately, consciously, and maliciously, say cretinous things to try and downplay the seriousness of an issue. This shit is mental and they all need to be fucking ball gagged and hidden in a bloody cupboard so the grown-ups can actually deal with it.

BPD,flct1bt,t1_flceopa,1585045319.0,Those are all good ideas! And thank you for taking the time to reply to me. I will try and follow your advice. I hope you stay safe X.

Scotland,fkodbj0,t3_fjoeab,1584384929.0,"St Andrews uni has done the same. No info on exactly what exactly will be happening as yet regarding exams etc, just that it'll all be online. Some of my lecturers really struggle with tech so it'll be interesting to see how successful this will be. Uni officially cancelled all face-to-face meetings, tutorials, and lectures due to start after spring break (been on strike for 4 weeks previous to this which might actually have helped stop the spread of the virus, which was an unintentional, but probably beneficial, side effect)"
GenderCynical,fh3zfjx,t3_f19a6q,1581273785.0,"I *love* father ted and black books. I grew up with his writing. But lineham's bizarre and vehement stance on trans issues totally put me off him. It's almost as if because he got called out (for *that* IT crowd episode) he had to double down. It's an odd hill to die on and he quite frankly deserves the ostracism.

 He could have made an effort to engage with transgender people and build bridges, but he deliberately choose to be an arsehole instead. He gets zero sympathy for his lack of work. He brought it upon himself. 

I used to follow the insanity on Twitter but it was all so fucking toxic. He listens to no opinions unless they agree with him. His own hubris led to this, not any imaginary 'trans agenda'. Such a dick."
books,fgk7iyd,t3_eymxsk,1580859164.0,"Currently trying to get through a degree in English lit and classical studies and I am finding reading my set texts so hard. I'm normally a voracious reader but my bpd gives me major depressive episodes and I find I just *can't* finish the texts when I feel like that.

 I suggest reading 'lighter' stuff. Disc world is one of my favourites to go to, Terry Pratchett was a marvel. If you start of with a wee book that you can immerse yourself in, you might find it easier to get back into the 'habit' of reading again. (I hope. That's what I'm attempting anyway) good luck! X. 

Depression sucks baws and drains the pleasure out of life but I does get better X x. 

(I've never commented before. I hope I'm doing it right.)"
