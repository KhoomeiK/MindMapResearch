JUSTNOMIL,fpxb4ay,t1_fpxa6e1,1588979180.0,sensitivity is important.  The other aspect that you determine when validating a new method is specificity.   Specificity is more strongly related to false positives where sensitivity is more strongly related to false negatives.
JUSTNOMIL,fpx1ml0,t3_gfvegp,1588973957.0,"I'm a lab professional.   Here are the issues with the antibody tests:

It's actually a positive that you want to have, not a negative, but there are lots of things to understand about the antibody tests:

1)  No one knows if having the antibody means you are immune, or if it does mean you are immune then for how long.   If covid-19 is behaving like other corona viruses in this respect, then immunity is short lived (in influenza, its gone by the next flu season).    It is a likely hypothesis that having an antibody to covid-19 means you're immune to it, at least for a time, but it is not proven yet.   Also unproven - if someone immune can still infect others even if they can't get sick themselves.

2)  If you're in the USA, the development of tests is a bit of a wild west show right now - the FDA has completely stepped away from their responsibility to validate the tests and ok them for use.

Related to 2) - Some of the tests have as much as a 50% false positive rate.   That is, it will show antibody when the person was not previously sick with covid-19.  It may be cross-reacting to other corona viruses including seasonal influenza.

3)  A negative test means the person has not been exposed to covid-19 at the time of collection.  They could have walked out the door of the lab after the sample was collected and immediately been exposed and the test result would not show this.   That is: a negative is only a snapshot in time.  

I hope this helps!"
