I grew up strict baptist until my bipolar dad went off the wagon when I was about 14. Everything was wacky from there and I had already been questioning about the religion up to that point. I believed in God, just not the practices the church stated. I decided to dive into philosophy and whatever old books I could find at the local library in search of answers. Found his quote somewhere along the line and realized that this fit me more than anything I‚Äôve ever really read on religion.

When I learned how to pray, I prayed for everything and everyone. I would stay up for sometimes 30 minutes praying at 6 years old that God would watch over the homeless, the poor, those in other countries, the lonely, the sick, etc. (It helped that my OCD made me not forget a single person or situation, lol.) But I prayed for the ‚Äúbad people‚Äù, too. I prayed for everyone. I thought it was only right, that someone else‚Äôs suffering comes from pain. That‚Äôs at least what little me saw from my dad, anyway. Nonetheless, I‚Äôll always be intrigued that M.T. and my little brain thought the same, even if only a moment.
