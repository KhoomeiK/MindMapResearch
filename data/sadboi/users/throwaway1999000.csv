COVID19positive,fq8oc9j,t1_fq7om0v,1589171066.0,"So actually there's cells in your immune system called antigen-presenting cells. The immune system destroys pathogens and these immune cells basically say ""Oh hey look there's one of those guys we don't like"". And they pick up the pathogen's corpse and display it on the outside of their cell proudly. Sort of like putting your decapitated enemy's head on a stick.

And scientists think the reason they do this is so that as these antigen presenting cells move throughout the body, they run through little ""toll booth"" receptors or checkpoints. Which can recognize foreign DNA from pathogens (Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns, PAMPS for short) and when these receptors ""see"" an antigen presenting cell and detect the pathogen it's presenting and its DNA, it starts the immune/inflammatory response and starts trying to track down and kill other pathogens that ""look like"" the antigen they were presented with (by that I mean similar genetic material). So you may still have viral fragments in high enough levels to be detected, but hopefully your immune system is mopping them up now."

BPDlovedones,fpeqm69,t3_gcqnbr,1588552858.0,"My exbpdbff was like this... I think. I don't know because we honestly never saw the money. 

Exbpdbff was always kind of bad with money. But when the mask slipped and it went to hell was when they and their partner (who was also my friend) bought a house together.  

His name was on the title. His parents helped him out for 5k with the down payment. The plan was she repaid the parents the 5k down payment and they take on the bills together as a couple. 

She wrote his parents a bad check for 5k and gave it to him. She. Wrote. His. PARENTS. A BAD CHECK FOR $5000. Supposedly she had money from her jobs all locked up in a 491k and couldn't touch it, but I think that's a lie too. 

And she mentioned it a day later casually telling him to tell his parents not to cash the check. No empathy. No remorse. She just wanted 'forgiveness'. Even though she's totally screwed two people who were gonna be her future in-laws. 

Things went to shit shortly after they moved in together. Her mask was gone, the abuse and gaslighting was constant and j got fed up with her abusing him and lying about shit. 

It ended in a screamig match between her one night when she tried to tell me she was better than me and I tore her false reality to shreds. Told her she actually didn't have a house to pay for because the check she wrote bouncedz she was horrible and abusive to everyone, and she probably wasn't gonna be in her relationship much longer if she couldn't get her shit together. Also brought up how her bad check was a class B felony.

It was a few months later and after a suicide threat that ended in a mandatory psych evaluation that her bf (mutual friend) finally called quits. 

She tanked a 9 year relationship in 9 months. Glad I got that all off my chest. I'm still mad at the shit she did to him, but she can't see how fucked up it was. 

I was painted black for trying to 'sabatpge her relationship' but it's pretty clear she did that herself. 

She also had a weird obsession with things. Like I came over after Christmas and she insisted on showing me all the gifts and things her mom bought her. Thought that was a little weird for a 30 year old but yeah. Financially irresponsible."

Generally here in the US it must be a legal parent/guardian who signs for the child. A babysitter or grandparent might be allowed to sign in an emergency, but it really depends. 

You wouldn't want to take your sister to the doctor just to be refused treatment because you legally can't sign for her. So call the docs and confirm before you even try doing this.

I had a really hard time getting diagnosed with pneumonia a year ago. I knew I was sick, slept 15 hours a day after work, miserable, et. Took like 2 weeks to find. It was really scary not being able to breathe well. I got an albuterol inhaler given to me after that.

Can I ask if a fever accompanied this recent SOB? Any dizziness?"
COVID19positive,fnoqwc7,t1_fnnbs2j,1587131784.0,"I get it, it's very scary. I was very anxious my first few days, and those were also the days with high fevers, so not pleasant lol. 

There's so much in the media about death rates and complications. There's so little out there about those who have (or are in the process of) recovering. I was like, ""there has to be a group of them somewhere. Somewhere, a community online of people"". And it's here!

This community has brought me such relief. I feel like I'm not alone anymore. I have people I can ask ""hey anybody else have this"" or ""is anybody else experiencing x?"". It's great, because the symptoms and experience with this can be so different for so many people. 

My first symptom was actually diarrhea 2 days before the fever set in. I read it was a symptom of covid but figured being anxious wouldn't help anything. Also I'm anxious by nature so having diarrhea is pretty common for me. But when the fever came 2 days later I kind of knew. 

I'm scheduled to do a drive-thru test tomorrow. Kind of anxious and kind of not, tbh. It's mostly for my own peace of mind.

This might sound stupid, but if I do have covid and recover (fever has been going down, feeling better) this may have some advantages for my family.

For example- I can go shopping (after I'm medically cleared and de-quarinitined) for my family instead of other members who aren't immune, and visit elderly relatives. I haven't been over to see my grandparents in weeks because they're so at risk, but if I can beat this then I can go visit them again.  

You bet I'm gonna keep up the hand hygiene and mask wearing even if I'm positive and have immunity (they're estimating were immune for about a year following infection). I don't want to bring home any virus particles in me. 

Anyways, life is a spectrum and cases vary. I feel so bad for those who have died or are fighting for their life from this disease and complications. I pray for those and their family members who post here about their situations and difficult decisions and losses. 

Everyone is stressed. Everyone is struggling. It's important to be kind and just listen. I hope this community helps you out a little! Once again, feel free to message me if you need to talk. :)"

JUSTNOFAMILY,fnlja80,t3_g290t7,1587054509.0,"Hey OP. I read your post history and just wanted to give you some internet hugs and say you got this. As a 20f myself (across the border near Niagra falls, I'm a Yankee) wanted to let you know that you're strong and brave and you got this. 

What your parents are doing is NOT OKAY. Your mom is wildly manipulative and controlling. Your dad less so, but I have a feeling your mom and the virus may have given him stress that he took out on you. 

Look out for yourself. Go to thesrpy- I know you're seeing a psychiatrist, which is good. Just look after yourself. You deserve it. 

Also- is there anyway you could stay with bf? I, too, am dating an older man (34, but I have known him for years and I made the first move when I was 19 lol). He's my rock. After my brother had a seizure and my parents had left to follow the ambulance he came and got me because I was an emotional anxious mess. He's always got my back and I love him. 

My point being- your relationship with your parents is unhealthy, through no fault of your own. But focus on the good relationships- the ones that are healthy, respectful and good. Build up your social circle. Having a few good friends nearby for support is really important during all of this. 

Finally- download a call recording app on your phone. I have one because my exbff turned out to be insane. Any ingoing or outgoing calls automatically recorded. Helps you have evidence sonyiur dad can't try to rugsweep the fact your mother is, for lack of a better term, fucking abusive and controlling, and it gives you evidence of harassment and what's going on in case you ever (hopefully won't have to) need to file a protective/no contact order."

COVID19positive,fnk0thb,t1_fnj0dsi,1587011757.0,"WHO said to avoid using ibuprofen, later retracted report. A lot of people with severe complications like pneumonia and organ failure get it from a ctytokine storm, where the body's immune system and inflammatory response goes into overdrive and starts attacking healthy cells with inflammation. 

I study biotech, and have heard rumors that using fever reducers may result in worse outcomes/longer disease. I'm hypothesizing that the use of anti-inflammatory meds like ibuprofen may play a key role in the cytokine storms correlated with adverse outcomes. Tylenol is what doctors are recommending atm I believe, because it's not antiinflammatory.

Not medical advice. If my fever gets too high and I'm too miserable I will take medication. 103 is dangerous for adults, there or approaching I will take something. But if I'm not horribly uncomfortable I may try to ride it out."

I haven't had a cough either, but I have a chest thing that comes and goes enough that I'm honestly not sure if it's gas or just being sore (like my back is) from laying down and using my laptop.

I got anxiety so I know most of my shortness of breath is in my head. Taking small walks seems to help. As it stands, I try to remind myself if I'm so short of breath I can;t talk or my fingers turn blue, I need to worry.

Would you mind describing it a little more for me?"
COVID19positive,fninx79,t3_g1r5um,1586983277.0,"Not to freak you out, but general anxiety/feeling ""off"" was my first symptom.

Started Saturday with diarrhea. Brushed it off. I have OCD and anxiety so I have good days and bad days. For 2 nights before the fever set in, I was very anxious. Didn't know why. Felt fatigued and headache but figured it was allergies and also I had a new job so figured adjusting to schedule. Fever of 101 on Monday proved me wrong. 

For me it comes and goes, tbh. Fever of 102.1 was my highest at like 3am, and I took some tylenol and put a cool rag on my head and fell asleep again. Woke up covered in sweat and fever broke, lol. It was back in the afternoon- afternoons seem to be the worst for me. Fever comes back and all.

I'm no doctor, and not in a place to be giving medical advice, but from what I've heard cytokine storm is a big cause of a lot of multiorgan failures and lung damage for those who have it worst. I know the WHO said that we shouldn't use ibuprofen and should stick to acetominophen, but I have had 3 ibuprofen when acetaminophen didn;t cut it and I was still miserable hours later.

Also heard rumors that those who use fever reducers have poor outcomes. Like I said, not a doctor, but I was about to get my bachelors in biotech and I'm familiar with cytokines/inflammatory cascades. So I personally have been wondering if using antiinflammatory medicines actually contributes to the development of these 'cytokine storms' causing the body to overcompensate with tons of inflammatory response, leading to such severe complications as viral pneumonia and organ failure. This is all just a hypothesis btw.

Once again, I'm not giving medical advice but I've honestly been thinking about not taking any tylenol until me fever is like 102.5 and just trying to ride it out. I've heard 103 is the danger zone. As a medical professional, what do you think?

I feel like fever is a flag something is wrong, not a danger, unless it goes above 103 in an adult. I'm not saying don't take any medicines, however, if my fever is 101 and I can make myself comfortable by taking off my clothes and putting a wet rag over my head instead of taking tylenol, I may consider it.

That being said, if the fever doesn't break in a few hours, I start feeling ATROCIOUS, or symptoms worsen/I develop chest tightness and shortness of breath, I'm DEFINITELY calling the doc ASAP.

What are your thoughts/feelings?

I'm sorry you're going through this, and I wanted to thank you so much for all the work you've done helping the sick. If it weren't for you guys on the front lines, our losses would be horrifically more, so thank you.

COVID19positive,fni0l9f,t1_fng4hvh,1586971952.0,"Thanks so much for reaching out! So I actually cannot take saint John's wort or 5htp because I am on prescription Zoloft, an ssri, and taking it with those supplements would put me in danger of developing serotonin syndrome. But thank you for the kind advice!

My Zoloft seems to be doing the trick though. And I have my mental health professionals available for phone visits so overall I think I am okay. :)

I just woke up from a pretty nasty dream where I was anxious for about a half hour following, but my fever has been down to 99.4 today and I just realized I slept through my anxiety meds so I took them asap lol. 

Trying to stay positive and look on the bright side. It just sucks because my anxiety attacks make me short of breath and then I get even more nervous which causes more shortness of breath and k obsess about not being able to breathe and it is a viscious cycle. 

Luckily I have known myself and my anxious tendencies for awhile. It's very uncomfortable, but I try to go for a small walk and take deep breaths. It normally passes in 45min, like all my anxiety does. At this point I don't believe I'm hypoxic or suffering respiratory distress- I've had pneumonia badly before, and right now I lack even a cough. 

Basically, I know I'm an anxious mess and won't believe I'm in respiratory distress until my fingers are blue lol. Otherwise- it's anxiety. 

Sorry for rambling a little bit just trying to work through this afternoon anxiety and it feels so good to talk to someone. I miss my family I'm not allowed it of my room and while I understand why it sure gets lonely here. 

Also walking around normally helps my anxiety but there's not much room in here. But I am very fortunate my symptoms aren't severe so I will keep looking on the bright side. Thanks!"

Woke up at 3am with horrible chills/sweating and a fever of 101.

There aren't enough tests so I've been told to self-isolate and am presumed positive. The nights are hardest for me. My brother has brain cancer and so I am not really allowed out of my room and my parents come to check on me and bring food but that's about it. At least my cat comes to see me.

The nights are the hardest it seems. Yesterday the fever got up to 102.1 but I took tylenol and have found a wet rag on my head with an icecube i can intermittently rub on my face helps a lot. 

I also have anxiety in general so it's hard not to freak out but I remember my brother doing his chemo and radiation. The human body is so strong- hang in there!"

This past Saturday (4/11) had diarrhea for an hour or two, was bloated and gassy, but I brushed it off. For a few days I'd been having headaches, figured it was sinus/allergy related because it's been raining a lot around her, whatever.

Early monday morning wake up freezing. Put on more clothes, go to sleep, wake up drenched in weat. Fever of 101.1.

Exhausted most of the day, just feel grossly fatigued. Get to bed early that night, wake up at3am with a fever of 102.3. Take tylenol, put a wet rag on my face, ect.

Fell asleep again and woke up at 8am drenched in sweat, fever seemed to have broke.

Today I've been exhausted and the fever comes and goes. Also congested- no snot, but hard time breathing through my nose. And I had some heart palpation earlier, but that was when my fever was really high (101) and also I have anxiety so trying to look on the bright side here.

My brother lives in the same house as me and has brain cancer so I'm beyond stressed. Been locked in my room these past few days and quite bored. I take tylenol when the fever gets over 101, and I took some motrin 3 hours later because fever was still over 100.

I have anxiety and this isn't fun. I mean, I've had flu/strep that felt worse, but I also have OCD and so I just keep reading articles and I worry day 7 of the disease will come and I will go into respiratory distress and die.

It's very similar to narcissm in that they're kind to everyone but behind closed doors the mask falls off. 

When the bpd in my life routinely threatened suicide to get their bf to do what they wanted and constantly started to verbally abuse me/scream at me over nothing, that's when I realized there was something going on here.

You were in a room that was on fire when you were in that relationship. You got up and walked to a new, safer room that wasn't on fire.

You either stand there and let the smoke creeps in and the fire start to consume this new, healthy room, or you slam the door to starve off the smoke and run out of the burning house.

These people are inherently disordered. It's not going to 'make sense'. They think in black and white. You're either good or bad. Your ex thinks you can still be useful so they are reaching out.

BPDlovedones,fmthc4p,t1_fmsroqj,1586372726.0,"My bpdexbff blamed a lot of her old relationships on teh guys, saying they were crazy. I watched her blow up a relationship of 9 years with a mutual friend and realized no, it wasn't everybody else- she was crazy. Suicide threats, manipulation, lying, emotional abuse, crazy explosions over nothing, drama, sobbing, insults- you name it.

The sad thing is she can justify it all in her head. I am now dating her ex, who was my  mutual friend at the time, and I'm sure in her head I'm literally a demon who tried to drive them apart from the beginning and he's fallen for it and also bad because he wasn't understanding enough of her mental illness (translation- refused to accept her diagnosis of Bipolar as an excuse for abuse).

I don;t know if she's been talking shit, though I'm sure she has. She still glares at us when she sees us in public. We keep our relationship on the DL for obvious reasons, have security cameras everywhere, and what not. But I'm sure if she were to find out we were a thing she;d flip her shit again. Not that I care, I'm happy, he's happy, we have security cameras and will defend our home, and the police are only a call away.

BPDlovedones,fmil7fk,t1_fmi16vw,1586111797.0,"This. After the worst fight I ever had with my ex bpd bff where I shouted back instead of taking the abuse and pointed out all the controlling, lies and abuse they were putting their current partner through, then revealed I'd been recording the conversation, they flipped. out.

Threatened to call the police (go ahead, recording the conversation was perfectly legal). Tried to call their parents (okay, if you need to do that go for it, but you are 30 years old and I don't know what they're gonna do to me, we are both adults).

They proceeded to then have a MASSIVE anxiety attack. Like, on the floor, shaking and vomiting, sobbing, hyperventilating. I know manipulation and this was not it, they were legitimately panicking. Saying they thought they had multiple personality disorder and something was seriously wrong with them. /That was one of the rare (are scariest) moment of clarity they had. 

They said they wanted to go to the hospital and so their partner and I took them. Looking back, I shouldn't have gone- they tried to bring me back into the fold and manipulate me again, but I refused to go back with them to the ER. I held the garbage bag in the car, held them, cried and did my best to calm them down in the car, but after that, I was just done. They painted me black ever since.

They told their partner that they could no longer see me, because I 'put them in the hospital'. Their partner said they put themselves in the hospital, and refused to be controlled. Thankfully, her partner is now out of that relationship and things have settled into normal. But it was honestly fucking terrifying to watch.

I honestly think she associates all the emotional pain and fear of that panic attack/ moment of clarity and thinks it is my fault. Granted, we had a verbal blow up- but before this, she'd been verbally blowing up at me for weeks. I had enough and fought back.

Also, looking back- I think if I'd have gone back into the ER room with her when she; asked and sat next to her and gave her attention on the ride home instead of distancing myself, she';d have considered me a source still instead of painting me black. Me purposefully distancing myself was probably the only thing that led to me being painted black. Which I am grateful for, because being friends with them was very taxing on my mental health."

Like you wanted to be left alone and she came into your LOCKED room. If the genders had been reversed here (you female, her male) and you called the cops, they'd have been all over that shit.

And the mental gymnastics is mind boggling. ""I don't feel safe with you here.""

""Um, if I'm so dangerous, why did you sneak into my locked room?"".

I felt so bad because he was going to the store to buy something with a coupon I'd given him earlier. He sort of functions at about 10 years old right now, sometimes younger. Like he doesn't realize he doesn't have money or things right now.

In addition, my brother is going through chemo and is immunosupressed, so I keep my dumpster food at my boyfriends house atm because we don't want to risk getting him sick.

I'd say my meals are pretty balanced. I don;t eat exclusively from dumpsters, to clarify- there's oftentimes food at home that I rely on for the majority of the meals. But I will peer into dumpsters, and if I see soothing I can use, I grab it. Just the other day I found a dozen of eggs with one missing- probably cracked- and grabbed that and brought it home, my bf and I boiled them up.

I eat a keto diet- low carb. So my meals mostly consist of meat, cheese, and nuts. However, if I find a pre-packaged carry away and cook pizza or something I'll grab it because I know my bf will definitely eat it (and I might have a little, too!)

I'm generally pretty healthy and athletic. 20f, 135-140lbs.

Also, it's worth noting- most dumpster finds, aside from large amounts of produce, is high-carb, processed foods. If I find some prepackaged baked goods only a little out of date or things individually wrapped, my family will eat those. But generally me and my bf consume dumpster food pretty regularly."

* What is your motivation for searching for and then personally consuming food from the dumpster?

It's free, easy, and a fun hobby. 

* If you have the financial means to purchase food, would you? Why? Why not?

I do have the means to purchase food. But it doesn't compare to the thrill of finding dumpster food. If I am craving a certain meal I may use my money to purchase it, but why by food when I can get it for free?

* What is the appeal about finding and consuming a restaurant or grocery store's thrown away food? What benefits do you see in sourcing food this way?

Lots of good produce is thrown away. Whole bags just because of one and apple. I use that to feed my livestock and pets. Saves me money and gives me time to explore/try new recipes with the things I find.

* What risks do you see in sourcing food this way?

Risk of injury getting the food out of the dumpster. There is often broken glass/boards with nails in them in the dumpster, so you always have to be careful. If you are in the dumpster, you should pay close attention. A dumpster diver was killed not long ago because they didn't hear the truck coming while they were in the dumpster. 

In addition, there's the risk of foodborne illness from stuff in the dumpster. If i find something without an obvious defect (out of date, bruised produce, dented package/can) then I am careful of recalls.

I live in a cold climate. IF it's consistently over 40 degrees out, I won't take meat/perishable or normally refrigerated goods from the dumpster. 

Even if I do eat meat, I always have one of my dogs or cats test it. If they don;t eat it, I don't eat it. I trust their nose more than mine. Never been sick from dumpster food, but I am anal about packaging being intact, ect."
OCD,fkjc0gf,t3_fioqdp,1584241657.0,"Um, yeah that nurse doesn't understand. 

I've been on meds since I was 11. I used to have an hour long ritual before I could go to bed. At 11. I was exhausted and anxious all the time. 

Meds made me functional again. I'm not the best all the time- still get anxious and stuff but I need these meds.

One day I was at work and I just started feeling bad. Bad thoughts, feeling bad, no hope for the future, ect. Realized I forgot my meds. 

Would she tell somebody on blood pressure meds or a heart pill to 'stop relying so much on meds'?. The only difference is if it's heavy use of an addictive medicine like benzos, which isn't good but if you need it to be functional and aren't risking others safety be driving you gotta do what you gotta do."
OCD,fk1kf49,t3_ffwdjc,1583781463.0,"Have you tried writing them down? K don't tell my compulsions to anyone except my bf bff and close family. Even then I don't share with the family too much because my mom also has OCD and I don't want to trigger her. 

I keep a journal of my obsessions and shit. Like not just passing thoughts but when it gets bad I write minute by minute feelings in my OCD journal because once it passes I don't remember that shit and then I have something to share with my therapist when I get there."
OCD,fk1k5va,t1_fk0ecti,1583781314.0,"Me, pausing and obsessing about how my stomach feels Everytime after I eat because I'm afraid of being violently I'll everywhere I go and then working myself up and panicking when i just have gas/ need to poop."
OCD,fk1jtno,t1_fk040py,1583781116.0,"I thought I outgrew my emephtophobia and that it was just normal panic anxiety stuff. 

But the last time I got sick I woke up and immediately knew something was wrong just wasn't sure what. Was a sweating sick mess (had been having diarrhea all day) and I knew something was wrong but wasn't sure what. 

So I parked myself on the toilet and then I stripped off my shirt and I could feel the pressure in my head and it was like my eyes were going to explode out and I was dying. 

I'm honestly not sure how much of that was illness vs anxiety though. 

Anyways I proceeded to be violently sick in the bathroom trashcan while having a bowel movement on the toilet. I was shaking and sobbing and asked my mom to call 911 at one point but by the time the vomiting passed I was so exhausted and relieved it was over I just went to bed. 

Kudos to my mom. Who stood with me the whole time and held the trashcan for me and wiped my face with a wet washcloth while I felt like I was literally dying. 

She also got that horrible bug later and I stayed up during the night with her because she too gets anxious when she's sick. 

I honestly don't know how people can throw up alone I always feel like I'm going to die. 

Once I pulled over because I felt sick and ended up calling my boyfriend mid-vomit because the panic was so intense I thought I was going to pass out. He actually came and followed me home because I was such an anxious shaking mess and scared to drive. That's probably the most unsexy I've ever been but yeah. 

I feel you. 

It's not so much the vomiting as not having control of my own body and not knowing what's going to happen until I actually do start vomiting that terrifies me."

BPDlovedones,fj9wmof,t3_fc9sng,1583161330.0,Might as well talk about Amber Heard as well. She assaulted Johnny drop and broke his finger by smashing it with a wine bottle. There's a petition to remove her from the next Aquaman movie because of it.
