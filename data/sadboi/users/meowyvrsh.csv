Mindset is so important and I believe everything is subconscious, we attract people who are narcissist, who are emotionally unavailable cause that's what we see and is the kind of relationship most of people have. Or even maybe for some their parents are narcissist and they think that's what love is. Its so important that we remove and heal our past trauma and relationships before moving or attracting the next one."

Every drug or experience depends on your mindset. And the drug shows you what you want to see. 

Psyconauts who think to get some insight from DMT or LSD or whatever psychedelics it might be, they will see what they believe. It entirely depends on the individual. I don't think everyone goes through spiritual awakening or change in beliefs."

It's not possible. Or they tell you to stay where you and not get out of your comfort zone. Then eventually you lose confidence on yourself when everyone around you is so unsupportive.

All the decisions I take in life is how to run away or stay far away from them. Staying away is also burning my wallet  but at the cost of my freedom and mental health. I was thinking about shifting with them back. So confused if I have to do it. My dad still spies and checks my phone. I lie so much to my family I seriously hate it. They don't understand the boundaries at all. I am not a kid anymore. They have been trying to get me married since I was 24. Somehow escaped that, but I am sure they will start again. It's so much pressure and stress thinking about them shifting back to this town. Good thing is I didn't move with them during the pandemic and saved my mental health.

Even i went through the same thing. Being sober, you forget and forgive or don't judge the person even if he / she says or does something mean. You rub it off saying they are joking or just saying dark jokes. While on acid, their true inner colors and vibes come out. If you ever have a doubt with any person trip on acid with them."

She was watching TV in the living room and I was in the room which is totally inside. I turned back to see my mom with hair open and not really walking, it seemed like she was floating with a stern look on her face kinda angrily outside the other room. I called loudly for my mom to come and help me but she couldn't listen or respond at all. I was all furious and came running towards the living room and asked my mom why she didn't respond.

I get frustrated and think low of myself when someone doesn't respond. Then I take a step back from getting angry and think maybe they are busy or something. And I try to start getting myself busy with something. This is all in our mind. 

We need to start getting busy with something, start reading a book, learn something new, spend time with you family. Spend time with yourself. Love yourself. When you do that you don't feel like getting anyone's attention and you can see them coming behind you giving you attention while you won't feel like even texting them or talking to them."

Ruby can be worn without consulting but I recommend to check with astrologer before wearing diamond and ruby. Astrologers specifiy the carat & on which finger you need to wear what stone as it's all connected to your Astrological sign."

Problem with me was my guy was a narcissist, he never showed his feelings or empathy towards me and I used to get jealous if he used to give someelse else attention. I learned how to love myself and be self sufficient. 

When we are in relationship we tend to crave for love and attention from other person which leads to insecurity and pain. Rather than focusing your attention on the other person, focus on yourself.
