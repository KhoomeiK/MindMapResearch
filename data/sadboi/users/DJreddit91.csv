Maybe it's actually a blessing in some weird, distorted way. Idk about you but I have social anxiety amongst other crap and stepping back into the gym or doc office after time away is often so daunting for me that even if I go the first time, it's hard for me to go again.

We fight by joining together and helping one another. Reach out to your neighbors and connect on how shitty this is or make a joke to lighten the mood. 

We show others how truly serious it is by doing the right thing - staying home, social distancing when we're out and respecting others. Our actions are contagious (no pun intended) and others will follow your lead if you're responsible, respectful and truthful. Educate yourself so you can educate others, even from a distance like a post about how to properly disinfect your groceries after you shop or a graph showing how infectious the virus is if we don't social distance. 

We make changes by working together. Your seemingly small action + mine + others will add up.

When I do wash it, I wash my hair once with TJ’s tea tree oil shampoo, then the second time with Emerge shampoo. I love shampooing twice, it makes my hair so soft and has volume, I've been doing it for years. 

I then put in the Emerge conditioner and squish to condition. I rinse out 80-90% of the conditioner then use Aussie curl milk and the emerge curl gel first with praying hands then scrunching. 

I let it mostly dry then scrunch out the crunch.

You have a goal and you haven't reached it - ”I was wanting to dress better this year”, ”I wanted to start traveling more”

You have an insecurity and see someone who you think is attractive and has the waistline you want. You follow them to get better tips and to see a picture of your ”goal bod”.

Your friend goes on lots of cool trips and spends a lot of $$, posting to their story all the time so you may feel competition which can be a motivator. 

So you're seeing that what these people are doing is getting them love, attention, kudos, an income, etc. and think ’ok then if I follow them, dress how they dress, work out like them and travel like that then I too will feel validated and happy (because they all seem really happy!).

After time when you can't keep up with them (BC ITS NOT REAL LIFE) you start comparing yourself to them - ’I can't follow through and/or achieve what they did so I'm a failure ’.

It's all a shitty spiral."
