Do what you love and enjoy doing. They are called passions for a reason. If there is an age where we are too old to still follow our passions, then what's the point?

PS : anyone telling you different is just jealous that they gave up their passion years ago and regret it after seeing you still enjoying yours"

Isn't the point of playing as a scav to, you know, scavenge off of PMC's and dead scavs? Especially for newer players who don't have any real loot yet, scav runs are their only way of learning/moving up without losing what little they have, then you shoot them for....what exactly? To take their scav vest and pistol? It's not like you get any XP by killing them, you just take their already pretty much worthless loot because....why? You feel cooler or something?

gopro,etyh1fs,t3_cdffnm,1563317931.0,"I own both a 6 and 7 Black. The biggest difference is the HyperSmooth. If you've never owned a GoPro before, you won't notice a difference in any of the other features (as a beginner). So decide what kind of footage you'll mainly be capturing, and how you plan on filming it. Will you be handheld, using a selfie stick, a floating grip, a gimbal, etc.? 

If you don't plan on getting terribly shaky or fast moving footage, the 6 will do you just fine. If you can save some money buying a used (but in good condition) 6 that also will come with some accessories (batteries, grips, etc) then that might be your best option. If you've already budgeted for a 7, but don't need the HyperSmooth, then take that budget and look for a 6 with accessories.

If HyperSmooth is important to you, then there is no option but the 7. And buying a 7, along with some basic extras (battery, battery charger, grip, etc) is going to get expensive fast. 

Bottom line - sit down, think about what you'll be using it for, what kind of footage, and what your budget is, and then go from there. 

Buying used isn't always a bad option if you're just starting out and are on a tight budget."
