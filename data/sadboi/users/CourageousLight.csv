MakeupLounge,fr1vwk8,t1_fr1sm3n,1589826825.0,"I was literally being honest with you about the look. It doesn’t matter what people have or have not said about them. I said I loved some parts but the eyebrows do look genuinely awful. Trends come and go and some people will look good with them and some won’t, but what’s classic and what looks good will always be what’s flattering. I never followed trends for this reason. Lol I also didn’t say it because I thought you were “confident about them”; that literally didn’t even cross my mind and I would’ve told anyone else the same thing if they were sporting what you are...wearing. But hey, if you want to go out in public like that, be my guest. It’s no skin off my nose. 🤷🏻‍♀️"

Thicker brows are gorgeous but I think if you trimmed your brow hairs and brushed them in the direction of where they grow instead of upwards, they’d look so much better."
POTS,fr0x67o,t3_glw05n,1589808804.0,"I think a lot of it is water weight from the salt and increased water intake, which we POTS patients are supposed to follow.

Cringetopia,fqshdmy,t1_fqsh1pq,1589607321.0,Oh it’s okay. 😅 I honestly don’t really care about Karma on Reddit. I was just stating my two cents on the matter. Take care of yourself. 😊
Cringetopia,fqshawq,t1_fqsgy6f,1589607263.0,"I wasn’t trying to judge anyone who wasn’t a virgin. Perhaps I’m not wording myself correctly. Unless he wants to lose it, I was saying I don’t think that virginity should be a good indicator of why no one likes him because you don’t know his position on the matter. He could want to save it, he could not. 🤷🏻‍♀️ But regardless people saying that is judging him on something subjective, we don’t know what his thoughts on the matter are. I agree this guy is a complete and total asshole with clear psychological issues. But people saying “no wonder he’s a virgin” implies he doesn’t want to be. What if he does? That’s why I’m saying it’s not a good indicator. 

And for myself there are many reasons why I’m waiting until I’m married, but I don’t want to get into that here."
Cringetopia,fqsgvu6,t1_fqsghdi,1589606938.0,"Oh, I know what he was getting at and I agree with the meaning behind it. My thought was that he could’ve said something else as I don’t think virginity is a good indicator of someone’s personality. I hope I’m making sense, I’m often bad at wording my thoughts. But thank you for explaining and for your reply. :)"
Cringetopia,fqsg3qb,t1_fqrlmcz,1589606329.0,There’s nothing wrong with that and it shouldn’t be considered an insult nor should it be considered a way to judge someone’s relationships (or lack thereof) by. Many people including myself wait until they’re married. :/ It’s probably more like he probably wonders why women aren’t interested in him. Virginity in my opinion shouldn’t be counted like that. :/

RandomActsofMakeup,fqcetee,t1_fqcchc7,1589256458.0,"I’m not saying there can’t be color combinations that aren’t pretty. I like blues and greens myself, and the Naked 3 palette has rose golds, purples, and pinks that definitely aren’t straight forward neutrals. Hell, I even like the rainbow eyeshadow looks I’ve seen on YouTube and I wear rainbow highlighter whenever I go out (because who cares if the trend is over, it was always gorgeous to begin with imo). What I am stating however is that the colors she chose aren’t flattering. Her inner corners are a neon blue which doesn’t match the bright orange and the deeper blue on her waterline (which doesn’t even connect to her inner corners) and severely clash with each other. Orange and blue make brown, so if she were to blend them, it would look really muddy, again, even with a transition shade I don’t think it would fix it. We can agree to disagree."
RandomActsofMakeup,fqcc5d8,t1_fqcbgeg,1589254675.0,"Even blending the colors wouldn’t look good with the colors she’s chosen, unfortunately. It would come out muddy and still clash together, even if she used a transition shade. I think that different shades of brown and gold would really make her eyes pop. I’ve also found that the Naked 3 palette works with literally every eye color I’ve seen. Maybe she should give that a try instead or try the new Naked Honey palette. That one looks gorgeous."
RandomActsofMakeup,fqc1tdw,t3_ghu8zb,1589248370.0,"I’m sorry; you’re beautiful, you have pretty eyes and eyebrows, and your smile is gorgeous, but this makeup look isn’t executed well. I’m not going to lie to you: it’s unblended, the colors clash, and the eyeliner is thick and blunt. Nothing about it is flattering and I genuinely don’t understand why people here are lying to you when it doesn’t look good at all."

BadMUAs,fq8x2jm,t3_gh5i2p,1589178093.0,"I don’t get why so many girls want to look this tan or orange. There’s nothing wrong with pale skin and even look desirable in many countries such as Asia. The point is, they should enhance what they naturally have, not fake a fan just because it’s “in”. They look like drag queens and that isn’t flattering on women. It can even make them look more masculine."
cheating_stories,fq8epp0,t3_geaduy,1589164523.0,I didn’t even need to read the story but did anyway. He definitely cheated on you. The big giveaway was how he lied about the cost of the train tickets and his sketchy behavior just compounded that as well. I’ve dealt with guys like that before and just dumped them. I’d just walk away at that point and find someone better.
