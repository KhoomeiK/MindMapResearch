My son was diagnosed with autism 2 last year and when I was filling out paperwork for him my eyes started to open, but it wasn’t until I had bad anxiety attack panic attack meltdown after meltdown that I talked to my therapist more.

For me a meltdown feels very confusing more than angry. My brain starts going in circles until I feel so worked up my whole body feels tied up in knots. Lots of crying and pacing and my stomach is in my throat.

I always assumed it was only anxiety.. but when the world makes sense to me I actually have hardly any anxiety."

Often during the DV help a woman gets she is educated about not doing anything to a partner either, but it’s mostly focused on an exit plan and building a support network.

I was abused and didn’t personally perpetuate violence on him, but when I finally asked for help there WERE many people who were “helping me” that assumed it was going both ways.

depression,fqvi4yj,t3_gl1gne,1589677769.0,"This is just my opinion from my experience.

It is very helpful to figure out why you feel the way you do, and once you see your wounds for what they are it hurts more to see how your life could have gone so different. Once you realize how your wound(s) took things away from your time you have on earth you will go through a period of grieving for those losses.

It hurts a lot, and this type of reflection is not for the weak.

It helps when you are meditating on alternative timelines that is the story of your life to allow yourself to feel it fully, then allow yourself to get into a different head space afterwards. You may have to come back time and time again.

I’ve found that personal symbolism does help me switch to different modes within myself. I meditate on the seasons of nature, death and life.

The once you go through the process you will get slapped in the face with another way that you have been fucked over. The key is to evolve from your realizations even when it’s difficult and give yourself grace to have a very different timeline of your healing process than other people do, or what your expectations may be for how it “should” look.

That being said, depression changes the way your brain fires. Once you feel nothing for a long time your chemical receptors/etc lie dormant and it takes so much effort to feel again. They can start up again I promise you.

I went through a period of utter nothingness, lost and going through the motions for a very long time. I actually thought it would be funny/ironic if I was murdered. It took danger to my child for me to force myself to change my living situation. It was the hardest thing to keep going when I felt completely dead inside.

When you start to live day to day in a healthier environment you can begin to start waking up again. I don’t know what changes you must make to your life, but often times people shut down the most when they feel as though they can’t make the changes they actually need to make.

You say that your life was handed to you on a silver platter. Maybe you need to get rid of the silver platter. It’s not a favor to children to be brought up like that."
