Paranormal,evz8n0x,t1_evz34w2,1564951617.0,"Yes it does. When a traumatic event happens in a place it leaves a mark. And when  a violent event happens it leaves a even bigger mark.

I was stabbed 9 times in my old house and the rooms it happened in never felt the same. And people who knew nothing about the event would comment on how creepy and  how they felt off I  the rooms.

We moved and since then it had helped with the healing process."
