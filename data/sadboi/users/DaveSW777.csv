FinalFantasy,fr4uqyb,t3_gmm9zs,1589897257.0,"Linear isn't a binary state in video games.  When people rightfully complain about 13's linearity, it's because each and every action you take in the game has only one option.  There is only one direction to go, one strategy that works in combat, one character you get to control, one path for your abilities to develop.  It's fucking awful.  It's like playing a runner, but with less depth.  

Ff10, I get to pick my party.  Explore towns. Have some control of my gear and abilities.  Progression through zones isn't always a straight line.  But yes, the linearity of 10 was and is its biggest weakness.  

FF7 Remake, because it's part one, does get a pass on forced linearity for two reasons:  one, I can replay chapters after I beat the game, and two, because the second part damn well better be less constrained.  Every materia and weapon is useful, there's tons of customization.  I'm not forced into always being Cloud during battles and there's multiple good strategies for every enemy.  Even with the heavy linearity, chapter 14 still lets me explore a huge chunk of the game in any order.  

FF6, the World of Ruin.  Celes, Edgar, and Setzer are the only characters you're forced to recruit.  While the game does encourage you to get Sabin before Edgar, and pushes you towards Cyan after you get the Falcon, you don't have to.  You can pick up the remaining 11 characters in almost any order.  The biggest complaint about the second half of the game is that there should have been more character specific side quests and dialogue.  But the WoR is absolutely a major reason why FF6 is so beloved.  It's also the least linear FF has ever been."
