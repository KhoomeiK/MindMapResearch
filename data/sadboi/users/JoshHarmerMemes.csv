mentalhealth,fpdbpkm,t1_fpctjx4,1588523836.0,"Yeah it can definitely trigger depression when friends bail on you. But I agree the best way to keep going is to be open to having more/new friends, because then there‚Äôs a better chance you‚Äôll find somebody who cares and is a good fit for you. But I also understand that can be difficult, because people not caring can result in a will to stay alone and not have friends. Sometimes the best friendships come naturally, so my advice is just stay hopeful and keep your eye out for friendships that could work."

As much as people can be terrible, I promise you there are people out there who are not, and people who can be great friends. It is easy to distance yourself from people after a situation like this, and if you feel like you need to, then go ahead. But don‚Äôt let this put you down permanently. Some relationships can cause the most pain in life, but others can give the most joy.

AskReddit,fjlca3b,t3_fe23bk,1583444066.0,"I have actually had to do this once. I‚Äôm in high school I had a friend who I knew since grade 4, who I had developed a fairly strong friendship with over the years. But he was being very toxic, and was impacting the well-being of me and other friends. It got to the point where I knew I had to stop being friends with him, so I said it in the gentlest way possible. He reacted very strongly with anger, but there‚Äôs really nothing you can do about it. I just had to kind of rip off the bandage and get it done. If someone is causing you to be unhappy, then you have the right to ask them to not be a part of your life. So be gentle with it, but just go ahead and rip off the bandage. I know that my friendship with that friend had become unhealthy and negative. So if you feel like your friendship is like that, then just do it."

But this freedom is part of the reason that English is so efficient - it only uses the basic 26 letters of the alphabet with no extra lines, symbols, etc on the words. Yes, it can get confusing when you fit an entire language into just 26 basic letters and there aren't really any ground rules, but that's part of the reason English is such a good worldwide and business language. It is diverse and complicated, but simple in basic construct. And it works perfectly once you know it really well."
musicproduction,fhmlz3w,t3_f3qcp8,1581714737.0,"I make music using Logic Pro X and yes there are definitely many factors for a song sounding full and powerful, but my suggestion would be to mix your songs to your favourite songs. Like try to get the levels in your songs to match popular songs that you love. Mixing is super important and a good mix can mean the difference between a full, powerful sounding song and a thinner sounding song. Mixing also includes stereo panning and ‚Äúwidening‚Äù certain instruments through stereo. Try to make your songs sound ‚Äúwider‚Äù through stereo work, and you can probably find lots of videos on it online. Hope that helps üëç"
