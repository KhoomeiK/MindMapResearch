While I’ve noticed that at least the churches I’ve been at have been much more understanding about mental illness instead of having a “pray it away faith will save you” attitude, I still feel bad for struggling anyway because I don’t feel like I should. I get into these states where I feel like God must hate me for making me the way I am. I feel like because God loves me that I shouldn’t be struggling internally. The only thing that has helped me away from that in the last year is learning about how Paul talks about “the groanings of creation” meaning that mental illness was never something God intended but instead is like other ailments of this world: not Godly, but still there. 

Meanwhile, mental health communities, especially on Reddit, will write you off as psychotic for being religious and mentally ill. They treat you like your faith is because you have a mental illness rather than maybe the two aren’t connected. I find myself ostracized for still having faith despite being mentally ill. It’s painful when people keep trying to tell me it’s just a symptom of my illness as though I have no ability to get better or be better than my illness.

unpopularopinion,fn61uhl,t1_fn5qa4w,1586684134.0,I am on Twitter. It is nothing compared to what I see on Reddit
unpopularopinion,fn5mm73,t1_fn5lf9b,1586669075.0,I’m trying to get better about that because I know I’ll want to defend myself even though I shouldn’t have to
unpopularopinion,fn5l46c,t1_fn5kx1e,1586667834.0,"I recently switched all of my sub follows from my main to my alt because my main was the same user as other sites. I was getting afraid I’d post the wrong thing, and then someone would start harassing me in other places too."
unpopularopinion,fn5l04h,t1_fn5kw1k,1586667743.0,"While I find it on other social media sites, Reddit is by far the worst in my experience"
unpopularopinion,fn4jg2n,t1_fn4h3ol,1586642621.0,"Reddit also doesn’t ever have enough details to make an informed decision. You’re talking about the same site that tells everyone to breakup with their SO or go no contact with family or long term friends for even minor things. I posted because I wasn’t sure in the moment, but I deleted because I didn’t think they would understand my relationship with my classmates. 

And my classmates are at least kind enough to affirm me that they HAVE praised my writing before and give me more perspective than a bunch of strangers who’ve never even read my writing and were only looking at the situation through MY bias. It’s not cringe to be able to be honest and communicate concerns with people. Reddit certainly can’t say my writing is shit if they’ve never read it either."
