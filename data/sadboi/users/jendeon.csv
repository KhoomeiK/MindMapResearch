Two things that help me a lot are the cramp bark supplement by Vitanica and Periodic tea by Earth Mama Organics. You can find them both on Amazon.
I’m honestly still in shock by how effective they are. I was pretty hesitant but thought I’d give it a try since they’re good for other stuff too and they have been more effective in relieving my pain than my prescription painkillers.

Good luck! 💗"
