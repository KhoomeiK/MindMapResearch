It’s a small cute place so I’d suggest just walking around- from what I recall without looking it up- I was there in the summer and just walked around- there’s a temple there that’s on one of the yen coins, a beautiful bridge, a statue commemorating a book of literature whose name escapes me, and tons tons TONS of tea shops (I had a proper matcha and tea sweet there at this tea shop overlooking the river), matcha shops, and matcha-themed foods! It’s a great day trip, I did it solo and it was the highlight of my whole Japan trip because it was so peaceful (and delicious!)"

AmItheAsshole,evwiith,t3_clf24i,1564864969.0,"NAH- this is going to get buried, but I’d suggest working together (or have him surprise you) with your wedding band. I don’t know your tastes, but if you get a custom one that fits the curves/shape of your engagement ring, with or without additional stones, that will change the entire look of the engagement ring when worn as a set and will be a way for it to be just YOURS, y’know? I think you’ll feel better as time goes on, I agree that the shitty thing is you found out in a humiliating way and your fiancé downplayed your feelings. Talk it out, this is a bumpy bump but I’m sure once you talk it’ll be cool :)"
