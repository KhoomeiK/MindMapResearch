Maine,fqya260,t1_fqy5jwi,1589745214.0,"I have a form of dysautonomia called POTS:

>Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) - estimated to impact 1 out of 100 teenagers and, including adult patients, a total of 1,000,000 to 3,000,000 Americans. POTS can cause lightheadness, fainting, tachycardia, chest pains, shortness of breath, GI upset, shaking, exercise intolerance, temperature sensitivity and more. While POTS predominantly impacts young women who look healthy on the outside, researchers compare the disability seen in POTS to the disability seen in conditions like COPD and congestive heart failure.

The exercise intolerance is because the body freaks out at small changes that other people's bodies handle easily, increased CO2 in my air being one of those things"

So I'm fine if I go somewhere in a car, get out, wear the mask for under 20 minutes, but if I have to walk where I am going I cannot wear the mask while walking or I get a bad bout of heart palpitations from re-breathing CO2. If I don't listen to my body and take it off immediately, I start losing consciousness. Obviously I'm not an idiot and after a decade+ of living with this condition I don't push myself to the point of actually fainting (I've fainted and hit my head on concrete, never again), but that comes at the cost of being perceived as an asshole right now.

It sucks so much ass. Yesterday elderly lady in a paper mask with visible gapping to the sides of her nose said ""you go right ahead and keep endangering others, bitch"" to me at the open air farmer's market in DOP.

My second child again met all of the readiness signs, he started slightly later at almost 4.5 months. I don't remember what his first food was (second baby syndrome 😆) but I do remember he was sitting in my lap and grabbed my hand while I was trying to eat, diverting the food to his own mouth.
