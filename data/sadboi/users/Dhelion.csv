Thetruthishere,fmeym5c,t1_fme88mq,1586016328.0,"Old family stories and dreams. 

We believe demons created both sides, the vampires (even if it is an anomaly) and the hunters (humans who gained this knowledge with the help of demons) . Regardless of what at the end is the humans who suffer. There is few demons (around 72) that can be named and some times help those who seek their aid, but for every one of those demons there are thousands whose names are unknown and act as they please.

The good part is that every one of those lesser demons can be expelled or even controlled with the help of those named demons.

Someone in my family some generations ago was helped by one of those named demons and he gained the ability to help others from lesser demons but that did come with a price. (It is just a family tale that has been passed down)"
Thetruthishere,fme310f,t3_fun5wu,1585987259.0,"

The idea of vampires is very far of what it used to be. 

A blood demon, has a living cycle very much like a parasyte. It enters the human body trough a wound, it changes and controls the host, the host doesn't realize until it kills a few people and injures others usually with knives, because that is how the demon get to transfer to other people, but it could take years to fully gain control of the host. 

A vampire is born when the cycle of the blood demon is interrupted, the blood demon enters a weak body and the host dies before the demon could gain control or switch bodies.
The demon gets trapped in the body if it is not cremated or cut. 

The trapped demon doesn't allow the spirit to rest and it will try to gain control of the life force of the dead, this only happens when an agreement is made between the demon and the deceased host. This combination of human spirit and demon is the vampire.

That's when manifestations start to happen in the place, the deceased appears as ghost and attacks people, if one of the attacks succeeds, it will enter a new cycle that will make the host very I'll and will start to crave for blood and human flesh. The host usually dies, but the vampire will easily switch bodies, eventually will reach to a pregnant woman an will give birth to the exact same image of the original host bodies, they will live in that body for many years and before that body dies they just move on to a different body, leaving behind tragedy and sadness.

The only way to kill the vampire is by destroying the body of the original host. Which will be well preserved or naturally mummified.

There is very few vampires out there, they have been born many times, the human spirit in them has completely killed the thirst of blood and they just live their sad and boring lives, they still like to cut people from time to time to experience life from other bodies when that happens their burned body is usually in a comatose state but they wake up when they return.

Modernity has take precautions to prevent new vampires.

There is really no need for vampire killers any more, and the job was mostly ungraving old tombs."

I saw Rama, in my dream I woke up and he was floating right in front of me he looked very young and the colour of his skin was blueish he then smiled and my heart opened and I started crying, tears woke up me up that time for real. I saw him twice that week, in the other dream he was even younger and he was playing with my computer chair.
In another dream I saw Kali the goddess, at the beginning she was a skeleton with robes like the typical death figure, but she took her robes and she was a little girl with a huge messy hair she was all full of love and everything around felt peaceful.
In another dream I saw a reptilian God floating in a silver disc in space. He was an all mighty figure and he made super frog like noise that accelerated my heart and me jump from bed.
And two times I have seen god in other shapes. The first , a floating pyramid radiating red gold and greenish light from it, in the four corners were 4 incandescent vases, the heat was extraordinary and a huge force was trying to pull you away from that place, eventually I was dragged from there.
The other, a floating wooden box.

But no virgins so far."

Play a few songs at sunset open two bottles of the same liquor invite them, make sure to drink from both bottles as they usually dont trust what you offer them. The good thing is they like to pay with real money I dont know where they get it but they do have the coin. The bad is they are pranksters and will move things around the house. 
For some reason they like to gather near fig trees."

Most of ghosts events are not really ghosts (or spirits of people who died) there are other kind of energies that manifest in these events and we tend to believe it is ghosts.

There is different kind of abilities and different ways you can use them for good, but you gotta learn how to maintain yourself in your own shoes, otherwise you will lose yourself and people will not be able to recognize you or even engage with you, in the eyes of the world you will be crazy. 

Once you have mastered your ability the simple process of communicate it to others will sound so crazy that you might be institutionalized. I have met people that are in this conditions and I lost a friend this way. 

Odd people calls for other odd people, you are not alone, you will meet others and will be able to understand how to walk the fine line that divides our world.

Be extra careful and always ask others for their abilities before you tell about yours. 

Try to always use your abilities for good, bad actions calls for other emotions and brings misfortune."

Depending on the person, animals could also refer to people near them. This happens often with people who don't or try to judge other people and are constantly betrayed. People are blinded and don't want to see others  who they really are. That is why in dreams we see all sort of animals behaving like humans or talking.

UFOs,f9xbxz9,t1_f9x2eqq,1575708571.0,"It was like 13 years ago. I used to do a lot of lucid dreaming when my mind was more clear and active. The usual stuff, eating in dreams, flying, fu**ing. But then I started to dream with people that I didn't create in my dream. The first person I saw was a lady, the most beautiful girl I have ever seen, she was dressed all in white, no shoes and was carrying something with a string in her back like a quiver. She didn't talked at that moment but she told me to be quiet and made signs to follow her. I did. We went deep down in some caverns and  then we started to go up and we reached a huge place, a lot of columns with a great view to the city and the see it was the sunset but no visible sun. I followed her until we reached three curved wooden benches forming like a circle. There were other 4 people sitting there, she sat in my left side, and I was the first to talk. They told me I was being interviewed like thousands of other people. They asked me about my point of view on different topics, religion, science, government, history  and ethics. I didn't have answers for most of questions. I got frustrated because I didn't received any kind of explanation. I stopped answering their questions and started asking my own questions, they all looked surprised, because I was able to wake up from the automatic responses my mind was giving. They seemed to be enjoying the situation. One of the older man offered me a drink. It was the most delicious drink I ever had, like fruity and mangoish, but the liquid turned into a gas in your mouth and it was cold. I recognized that feeling from a serious of dreams I had several years ago when I was 13 or 14. And I told them that. The guy who offered me the drink got serious. Then the lady spoke. It was me, I gave him the ""drink""  some time ago.  The older man approached to me and look me in the right eye and told me, you cannot drink more of this, your mind will not handle it and you will not be able to return, you will get mad. Then they started to tell their own stories. All of them relate to Earth, but they are not from this planet, they don't have physical bodies like we do, but they can interact with us if they want, usually in dreams, that way we can see them more like us. For some reason these 5 people seemed to liked me and I  went to that city 2 more times, I walked their streets and saw their buildings. It seemed at first sight like low end technology, but I understood that they had machines so small invisible to the human eye. After that I was able to dream to different places in time on Earth or beyond. For some reason I got hooked on some bad stuff that happened. That is when out of the blue in my dreams I started to notice 2 men all dressed in black, more like the guys from matrix than MIB, but they had hats. Black glasses, earpieces, black tie, black shoes, white shirt. They didn't care for me, and usually they appeared and disappeared from my dreams really fast, until one night they noticed me. I even heard when one guy said ""he can see us"" the other mib said ""he can remembers"" I changed my dreamed as fast as I could, but they were chasing me, in the end one them grabbed me by the arm and told me. -The mind is a very dangerous place, there's passages and corridors that people shouldn't see. Have you dreamed of something out of the ordinary? - I immediately remembered my dreamed about that city. The other guy said something but I couldn't hear him he was muted he was talking to somebody else. Then then the first guy told me. Then, you have but not a big deal. You don't seem their type. This is your first warning. Next time will be different, wake up. And I woke so thirsty with huge headache like a hangover, but didn't drink the previous night. I got several weeks of continuous nightmares after that, so intense that I started to forget all the dreams from the night. Until I broke free from one those nightmares and I saw them again. He told me,- there is nothing for you on the other side, just nightmares and you could be trapped there forever. This is the last time we are going to see you. Wake up. And I woke up. And it was the last time I saw them. I had terrible nightmares from that day that I stopped dreaming. My health deteriorated because of lack of sleep, I started to have panick attacks, I had two suicide attempts, because that was the only solution I was having at that time I have been in therapy since then and Drs tell me that those are just dreams shaped by my own anxiety and fears. I was medicated for several years, I still struggle with depression and anxiety and panic attacks, I still keep my right eye. But I don't even dare to lucid dreaming anymore I think if I do it again they will kill me. 
Hope this gives some insight. I have seen some crazy stuff as I said, and apparently some people near me can see that stuff too. Crazy stuff I have seen in the sky. Giant worm or snake, in cloud shapes, moving like a dragon or snake in the sky, my mom saw that too. Geometrical cloud really low with someone on top of the cloud. Brown light (if that is even possible) my cousin saw that too. Brilliant white blueish tears in the sky that stay there for days and my classmates told me those were made by planes, three days in a row, I told them it's been there for hours, it was like that yesterday don't you think that is a little strange?- commercial aircraft like regular airplane changing color and shape into mercury reflecting light and then vanished from the sky. Several people saw this, some saw the plane, but none saw when it shaped. And also I have seen other stuff not in the sky. From shadow people to giants. 

There is a lot of crazy stuff out there but now more than ever you have to be crazy to be able to see them I don't really have other explanation."
