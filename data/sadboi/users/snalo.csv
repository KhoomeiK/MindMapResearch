StardewValley,fimcy0w,t1_fimcrpu,1582525449.0,Well good because it taints the whole thing to the point where I and many others hold the opinion that it's a fetish of animals
StardewValley,fimcsqs,t1_fimcmns,1582525297.0,Because it sexualizes animals. That is wrong to me on many levels. How can you look at a pet dog and twist it into what some furries do. Kind of taints the whole image of furries and it's not societies fault that it's viewed that way. People in the furry community did that themselves.
StardewValley,fimciq1,t1_fimcfht,1582525015.0,As long as it never crossed into real animal territory then go at it.
StardewValley,fimca3o,t1_fimc7ax,1582524776.0,Ok furry. It's still weird and you know what parts I am referring to. You have your opinion and I have mine :)
