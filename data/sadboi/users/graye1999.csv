WatchPeopleDieInside,fr5ihrv,t1_fr563cv,1589909105.0,"I’ve found that this works for non-aggressive cats:

1. Kneel on the floor

2. Put the cat in between your legs so that their head is in between your knees and they can’t back away because they’re securely wedged between your legs

3. Hold their face right below their lower jaw with your non-dominant hand

4. Pop the pill down their throat with your thumb from your dominant hand forcing their mouth open from the side (not too forcefully of course). Try to get the pill as far down their throat as possible without gagging them. 

5. Continue to hold their face with your non-dominant hand so they can’t spit it out or run away

6. Rub their throat with the dominant hand until they swallow (always check to make sure they swallowed it by opening the mouth again with your dominant hand by wedging your thumb into the side of their mouth)


If the cat is aggressive, wrap in a towel and have someone else hold them in a bear hug so their claws can’t escape and cut you. Then use the same method to hold their face, pop the pill in, then massage the throat afterwards."

I have struggled with both of these conditions along with dysthymia (chronic “high functioning” depression) and it has been VITAL for me to be in counseling regularly. I go twice a month but honestly even going weekly would be helpful, I think. She needs a neutral place to dump her fears and anxieties and receive feedback on how to manage it. It sounds like you’re her only dumping ground and that’s going to strain things. 

In regards to medication, it can be very helpful at leveling things out, but be careful because it can easily make things worse than they already are. I would advise going slow on introducing new medications and doing them one at a time so any side effects can easily be identified. If you have a doctor that prescribes a whole bunch of medication all at once, it’s hard to tell if one of them is causing issues if things should go wrong. I would find a highly rated psychiatrist in the area if you both decide medication might help. And don’t be afraid to change psychiatrists if it doesn’t seem like a good fit. This is based off of my personal experience so it may not apply to you and your wife. 

You are doing a good job. It’s totally normal to not handle things perfectly, so take what you’ve learned but DO NOT beat yourself up about it. The truth is, even if you did separate from your wife, in some ways you’ll still be dealing with the issues that result from her struggles, so getting her help will only help you out, too, no matter what happens.

Edit: as far as the white lies to escape, in my opinion it’s ok. You need a break. Do not feel guilty about that, but it’s good that you’re identifying it for what it is. Once things get better it will probably be less of an issue. You seem like you love her, but every relationship has valleys like this. It’s ok!

You should absolutely tell your other doctors that you do not have Chrons. This is affecting your care. It’s important to have an accurate chart and you did not make the choice to manipulate your diagnoses in your chart. Your doctor alone is responsible for that. You do not want to continue with this inaccurate diagnosis in your chart, because it can affect your care. 

I would be surprised if the insurance company ever comes back and does an audit of the claims that have been filed, however, if they do and the claims are rejected, your doctor should not come back to you asking for you to pay privately.

(https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/holiday)

These paid holidays are usually based on the federally recognized holidays: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_holidays_in_the_United_States

Most hourly jobs do not have paid time off, so if anyone wants to take a vacation and it’s not a designated paid holiday, it will be unpaid.

Every hourly job I have had gave me 1 1/2 times my hourly wage, sometimes double, when I worked on a federal holiday. Most of those jobs did not have paid vacation, which is separate from the federal holidays. 

If you have a salaried position, it is different. You get paid holidays (typically also the designated federal holidays) and also paid time off outside of those holidays. 

I have never been in a salaried position where I did not get those benefits. My current employer gives me paid time off, paid holidays, a floating holiday day to be used when I want it, paid volunteer time if I want to spend a workday doing charity work, and a mental health day.

I’ve never felt uncomfortable except one time when a child stuck their head under the door to talk to me, and even then it was funny and their mother was appalled which made it even funnier. I honestly don’t get why people are so freaked out at the idea that you can see someone’s legs when they’re peeing/pooping or that you can peep through the side of the door. 

Plus in the newer bathroom designs where multiple gender identities can use the same bathroom, they’re MUCH more cognizant of whether or not people can see into the stall."
pregnant,fpfdv4h,t3_gd54i9,1588568381.0,"I told my boss when it was obvious enough that someone asked if I was pregnant. We were going to wait until after the first trimester but then it kind of became a wager between my and my husband as to who would say something first. We work at the same job. Anyway, it turned out that 19 weeks was the time when someone had enough guts to ask so that’s when we told our bosses."

I love how you described it though!"

So awful. 

I’ve heard of this happening before to a man. Don’t have the news story to link though."

I’m sure she was totally horrified. Lol

I’ve been fortunate in my Facebook stalking that I haven’t done anything like that. It’s so easy to do!"

instant_regret,fp9oca8,t1_fp975pl,1588431052.0,"Considering that we are fostering, this isn’t a permanent situation. But thanks for the judgment!

Also, resident kitty used to live with another cat before this one and they loved each other. So we never could have predicted it would go this way. But again, thanks for the judgment. 

Anyway, we are actively seeking a home for the FOSTER cat who was literally stuck in a cage at a vet’s office for two months since NO ONE would take him. Since then, they’ve been separated and are doing fine that way. We are not keeping them together and neither can hurt the other one. So again, thanks for the judgment. I’m sure you have spent many years of your life doing what you can to help homeless pets find loving families by fostering, so of course you’re the expert. Maybe YOU can find someone to adopt the foster kitty since you’re such a wonderful perfect animal behaviorist. 

By the way I am working with a rescue, they’re aware of the situation, and I’m actually friends with the rescue owner. So again, since you clearly know better than all of us, maybe you should be in contact with the rescue to give them all of your ideas to fix the situation, because we’re apparently ignorant. /s"
instant_regret,fp7gql9,t1_fp7ce7b,1588370311.0,The white cat also probably doesn’t want to run because the bengal will give chase/attack.
instant_regret,fp7ggx2,t1_fp6xke1,1588370169.0,One of them eventually backs down so they both walk away. There are probably signs that humans can’t see that the cat uses to indicate that they don’t want to fight anymore. But don’t be fooled. There was a challenge and there was a winner.
instant_regret,fp7g60r,t1_fp6v3qz,1588370008.0,"Cats don’t care. 

My female cat hates our male foster kitty. Absolutely hates him. 

She is 3 lbs lighter than him, almost 10 years older than him, is losing her teeth, has no front claws, and suffers from seizures (she’s had a hard life... poor thing). 

He is 3 years old, has all of his claws, perfectly healthy teeth, no health problems, and is incredibly muscular. 

He’d kill her easily and he doesn’t like her anymore because she is so hateful to him. He tried making friends but they’re done. 

We’ve tried over and over to integrate them but the female cat is such a brat and for some reason thinks she can take him, so they’re permanently separated. It sucks. I wish they could just be friends but she’s such a jerk that it’ll never happen! 

Of course I love her to death because she’s a sweet as pie to me. But she can really be a jerk sometimes. And kinda dumb.

Edit: Just so the white knights of the world are aware, we are keeping the cats separated. The foster kitty has never had a chance to hurt the resident cat. Go take your animal activism elsewhere. And the male cat is a FOSTER cat which means it’s not a permanent situation and he is up for adoption with a well-established rescue in my area who knows the situation at our home. So again, stop with the judgment. Thanks!"
