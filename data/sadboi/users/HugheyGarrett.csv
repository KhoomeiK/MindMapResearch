I know that Abilify induces pretty high rates of EPS compared to other SGAs. The whole dopamine partial agonist thing kind of sketches me out. You may want to try Zyprexa (olanzapine), assuming you have to be on neuroleptics. I found it to be tolerable recently, at least for a few days until they added Prolixin..."
Akathisia,fh5sbov,t1_fh3rm1n,1581291864.0,"I guess after having a decent life as a child, then being subjected to >25 meds and over a half decade of tardive akathisia, I'm a bit biased. The chemical imbalance theory (which was propagated by Eli-Lilly to market Prozac in the '90s, despite the lack of scientific proof to substantiate its existence) sort of implies that those who can't tolerate meds are eternally fucked in the head. Meds alter normal brain function, for better or worse. Every time I take a psych drug, it just makes me agitated and suicidal. But do whatever works for you, I suppose."

This has been better than the last doctor, whose office stole $150 from me by telling Walgreens to rip up the prescription.

Akathisia,ff317t5,t3_eqp1iw,1579530961.0,"Honestly, from my experience, taking more drugs such as ethanol or diphenhydramine may only serve to perpetuate and exacerbate the akathisia. I know how tough this side effect can be to live through, but your best bet would be to just ride it out if at all possible. Within weeks you should be feeling less restless, agitated, uncomfortable, and distressed. Be thankful it was only a one-off dose. This too shall pass."

Tossing, twitching, freaking out and getting back up to pace again. Looking back it seemed like anxiety and akathisia induced. Possibly an early manifestation of bipolar disorder as well. Either way 0/10 would not recommend. Oh and if you stop sleeping completely for even just 3 days, go the the fucking ER (even w/o insurance), because your psychological state can degrade pretty quickly into delirium."
legaladvice,fcti9v5,t1_fcthe9j,1577944199.0,"     Thanks. So if I tried to sneak a phone in underneath my clothes, that would be illegal? I really shouldn't start any trouble with these people. It's simply a trigger every time I go back there.  

     For some background, I'm a 23 y/o who was charged with domestic violence at the end of August. My dad bit my finger, so I punched him a few times, shattering my knuckle in the process. He calls the cops and they take me to the ER which does nothing but give me Tylenol and ice after I screamed in pain, and then I'm immediately arrested.

My father was supposedly the victim in this case, but he really didn't want to press charges. He understood that I was just in a mixed state and maybe in need of some rapid tranquillisation. Regardless, they kept me in jail for like 2 and a half days (most of it spent in solitary because I was ""attention-seeking"" by panicking and sobbing), and now I have to pay the court $1805.
