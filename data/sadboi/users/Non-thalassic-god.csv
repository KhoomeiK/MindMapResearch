I sadly don’t really know how to stop the guilt. I’ve seen people before suggest writing down feelings as a you feel like a binge is about to begin or trying to engage in another activity you enjoy (maybe even with family if you’re able to do so). Even if those things don’t help, I really do hope you manage to stay strong and safe and aren’t hard on yourself; just because you feel guilty for “wasting food” doesn’t make you bad or selfish :("

Personally I don’t get sunburnt but I tan really easily. since I don’t really get sunburnt, though, I hardly wear sunscreen which isn’t great for my skin ://"
