Anxiety,etvqxs4,t3_cdmy2t,1563242443.0,Yup. Literally every interaction with everyone I overthink to some extent. Did I say the right thing? Did I go about it the right way? They think I'm an idiot don't they? If I get through one conversation without ruminating about my ability to socialise then it's a win.

Keep up the good work ðŸ™‚"
relationship_advice,esbzrzs,t1_esbxil1,1561816951.0,Are you speaking from experience? If so I'd appreciate your story!
relationship_advice,esbyum1,t1_esbwv75,1561816125.0,"That's exactly right, communication is so important. Of course there are times where we go out and do things and try to spice things up but it's the idea that we are together so often, that sometimes we get bored. The fact that we'll be so full on with uni and being around each other so often worries me that we'll only see each other stressed, tired and that could impact our relationship."
relationship_advice,esbyfxu,t1_esbx2rr,1561815760.0,"We think we know our relationship well enough to take this risk. I just wanted to see how others faired. 

We know that living together isn't a problem. We just want to make sure that we're the happiest we can be while we enter stressful master's degrees. I think you're right the sooner we take the leap the better"
relationship_advice,esbya08,t1_esbxil1,1561815607.0,"Why's that? We've explained to each other that we actually think it would be best for our relationship while we enter the two most stressful years of our lives. We know we can live together, we just more independence while we are studying and thought seeing each other less frequently would equal more effort and therefore happiness"
relationship_advice,esby3ku,t1_esbwrko,1561815442.0,"From what we've discussed, we expect for their to be more excitement in the relationship as a result of more effort being put in from both sides. Realistically we'll both be busy with study, but seeing each other once a week and focusing on us in that moment rather than spending 'us time' because we're under the same roof every day, seemed like a good idea to maintain independence as well as stay happy.

If things don't change then I guess we admit that its a fundamental problem in our relationship? I agree the sooner rather than later"

Thanks! Are there any other good groups on Facebook you could recommend?"
physiotherapy,es0b7vz,t1_es07obf,1561471032.0,"Stressing is what I do best but I appreciate the great advice! Getting stuck into practical assessments rather than lurking is a hot tip, just need to be prepared to get things wrong often during practice assesments.

I actually am volunteering as a sports trainer with FFVs junior Matilda's program here in Melbourne. It's a good gig with a lot of physio observation but I'm not too good at taping yet. Hopefully that comes with time. 

How did you find learning how to work with patients/clients? Did you develop good rapport skills during placement or is this covered in theoretical units?

Thanks again for your help :)"
physiotherapy,es0asw1,t1_es07otd,1561470724.0,"Thanks for this. I don't have a background in exercise and I feel this is the area in which I'm lacking the most. As my degree was more of a research focused health science bachelor, my lack of knowledge of exercise prescription and biomechanics have me feeling underprepared! 

Where did you study your course?"

soccer,eoaf8ic,t3_br291d,1558415605.0,I'm interested to see how many Chelsea fans actually want this to happen. I love Lamps. He was the face of Chelsea for years and there's no doubt that he would have a positive influence on the team by the sheer amount of respect current Chelsea players will have for him. But this is an inevitably bad move.
