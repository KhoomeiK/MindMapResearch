Zwift,fqk06g0,t1_fqi0wce,1589417902.0,Excellent advice!
Zwift,fqjzhuq,t1_fqi25hj,1589417562.0,"Yes, exactly like that. Solo rides mostly but I do a fair amount of workouts too. I have just been consistently challenging myself to keep the pedals spinning at a minimum of 90. Second goal is Keeping a minimum of 2w/kg no matter the course. I‚Äôm sure this probably isn‚Äôt the best approach but it‚Äôs what I did and I‚Äôm happy with the results I‚Äôm getting. Good luck!!"
Zwift,fqi27rk,t1_fqhax0q,1589388545.0,"Much easier, but that may just be me. It really makes a difference when climbing. I rarely get dropped on climbs now"
Zwift,fqi08lo,t1_fqhjg63,1589387617.0,"I was a natural 75 rpm type of guy. I‚Äôve ridden some centuries and even a couple 2 day, 175 mile tours at that cadence and I have no idea how I survived. The higher cadence has equaled more watts and stamina. I‚Äôm still by no mean fast but I‚Äôm a MUCH better cyclist all around because of Zwift!"
Zwift,fplhncx,t1_fpkcw81,1588712875.0,I just open the app and use the ant+ at the same time. I don‚Äôt know that I ever did anything specific. I just plugged in the dongle and opened the app. They both track me simultaneously. Sorry I don‚Äôt have a better answer.
Zwift,fpi0vp4,t3_gdkf30,1588631477.0,"Hello fellow Zwifter,
I use both because often when I‚Äôm out of the saddle using a big gear and low cadence one of them will drop the signal. If I‚Äôm only on the app or PC, my watts go to zero and my avatar just pulls over and stops. When I use both I rarely have the low cadence causing a stop. 
Just my experience! Could be my internet signal from router is weak or 100 other variables, just passing along my experience. Ride On"
Zwift,fp48079,t3_gb01g1,1588293527.0,Yep. Typical...

Zwift,fl6s805,t1_fl6fesu,1584881709.0,My FTP is 195. On this ride I averaged 148watts but I did get off the bike twice to stretch. I‚Äôm a Cat D rider. Usually holding right around 2 w/kg. I was well below that since this was 2-3 x‚Äôs the length of a normal ride for me.
Zwift,fl6rv0x,t1_fl6p17e,1584881362.0,"Yes, it‚Äôs one of the many Watopia routes you can choose. I started working my way through them a couple months ago. There are much greater challenges than this one yet to go!"

Testosterone,fhc5e3m,t1_fhc4ix3,1581456552.0,I have not given blood personally but I‚Äôve heard a lot of positive things. Definitely worth a try!
Testosterone,fhc39h3,t1_fhc1ued,1581455326.0,"Forgot to ask. Does your doc use a pharmacy that premixes an AI in with your test? Mine does and, although I‚Äôm no doctor, I feel like I just had to get used to the test. I was at 80mg/week for at least 4-5 weeks before the sensitive nipples the day after injecting went away. I actually though I had the beginnings of gyno early on because the nipple pain was SERIOUS. Today I take 100mg week and my total is just under 800, free at 21. The same amount of test 30 weeks ago blew my doors off, made me bloat, gave terrible nipple pain, no libido, brain fog, etc had me at 1500 total and 70 free. So, what changed other than me?
All I‚Äôm sayin is give it time. You‚Äôve chosen to live this TRT life, make the most of it!
Best wishes to you, sir!"
Testosterone,fhc1f3k,t1_fhbtrfw,1581454267.0,"I did experience that and more. At 5 weeks I was questioning ever even trying TRT. All the wonderful things I had read about mental clarity, fat loss, and libido like I was 18 again, simply weren‚Äôt happening for me.  My second round of bloods revealed that my test was through the roof! 1500+ total and 70+ free made me go to YouTube for advice, bad idea. I started Anastrozole 0.5 mg every other day, and things got worse still! No libido, no motivation, constantly irritated and I GAINED 6lbs on top of the water retention. My doc reduced my dose to 160mg/week and told me to stop the AI as I had completely crashed my E2. I was still having problems and just about to say the hell with it all together.  Then I went to 2 injections per week without asking my doctor and I finally began to hit my stride. With 2 injections per week we were able to go back up to 200mg week WITHOUT any Anastrozole. That‚Äôs when it really started to come together. It took about 20 weeks to trial and error to get dialed in. Now I‚Äôm livin the TRT good life. Weight is stable, I‚Äôm making constant improvements in the gym, and my mind is functioning as well as any time in my past (I‚Äôm 43 BTW). Now I continue to tinker with food, sleep, and workout routine, in an effort to maximize my results. 
Unless your E2 goes through the roof, avoid the AI! Keep an eye on your prolactin (all your numbers really) and enjoy the ride. It takes time to dial in but once you‚Äôre there, you‚Äôre good to go!"
Testosterone,fhbnzt1,t1_fhawhob,1581446213.0,"Test I do IM, hcg I do SubQ. I‚Äôve been on for about 30 weeks now, so I am used to it. In the beginning, I had a serious aversion to needles (not saying you do), so it was a pretty big decision but, man oh man, was it ever worth it! No more water retention, no more swollen and crazy painful nipples, and no more rollercoaster libido and emotions."
steroids,fhbnfly,t1_fhb41nl,1581445879.0,"I appreciate what you‚Äôre saying. I just don‚Äôt understand replying at all if you think the question, or the person asking, is ‚Äúlazy‚Äù ‚Äúa dumbass‚Äù or ‚Äúbitching.‚Äù 
But, then again, I‚Äôm an old man on the internet trying to communicate with kids that don‚Äôt understand me and I don‚Äôt understand them. No big deal. I was fine until people decided to start throwing insults. I just don‚Äôt understand. I asked an equally ‚Äúrookie‚Äù question on a different sub related to exercise and fitness recently and got nothing but positive feedback and understanding. 
Regardless, I do appreciate your feedback sir. Have a good day!"
Testosterone,fharor4,t3_f26qca,1581424746.0,"Your story sounds similar to mine. Doc gave me extra Anastrozole too. Like others have said, splitting that up into 4 injections may help, it certainly helped me. I had the exact same protocol but my sides went away completely when I went to 100mg Sunday night and Thursday morning. Also split HCG up into one 25 IU injection on Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning. When I told my doc how much it helped, she said ‚Äúgreat, I‚Äôll double up on syringes and needles for you!‚Äù"

I was watching the level 19 bar closely as it neared being full (I actually thought the next mile was going to push me over to lvl 20). I just so happened to complete a course right then and I jumped to level 20 plus some XP. I hadn‚Äôt completed the mile that I was on either. That was when it dawned on me, courses = points! I‚Äôm embarrassed that it took so long but I‚Äôm excited about seeing new courses that will force me out of my comfort zone."

Testosterone,f606wtj,t1_eyr3iwi,1572607939.0,I apologize for the incorrect info the hcg is 250 units Wednesday and Thursday then test on Fri. Since this post my dose has been reduced to 160mg test cyp per week. The hcg is only for the first 7 weeks of a ten week cycle. I go back on hcg next week. These weeks without hcg suck. Shrunken sack keeps my testicles very tight and uncomfortable. Libido has dropped off as well.

I also agree with what‚Äôs been said before, use workout mode! Do an FTP test and then do workouts for a month or pick a plan, there‚Äôs a great FTP builder for beginners. It will increase your fitness AND your confidence. I used to give up at the start of every hill, but after doing the FTP builder I know for a fact that I can put out enough power to get through a 2-3 minute climb. 
Most important is to keep riding! I got dropped on every single ride for the first month but then I did the workout plan and now I only get dropped on bigger climbs or rides at 2 w/kg. 
Keep cranking my friend, it does pay off!"
