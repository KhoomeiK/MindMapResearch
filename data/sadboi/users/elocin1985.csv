Genealogy,fqu5gjx,t3_gkqur0,1589652392.0,"We never knew anything about my great-great grandparents. They were Hungarian immigrants. My GG grandfather worked in the coal mines. My great grandma would never talk about her parents. I just knew that she never drank, ever, and knew that it was something to do with it “running in the family.” 

Then I solved the mystery several years ago when I found about a dozen news articles about how he went on a drunken rampage, chasing his 9 children around the house, including my great grandmother, told them he was going to kill himself, and drank Lye in front of the family and ended up in the hospital. And then he died the day before he was scheduled to be discharged. 

“....made three unsuccessful attempts to commit suicide has recovered sufficiently from the third attempt, that he was to have been discharged from the local hospital yesterday. Authorities hint that there is a strong possibility that outside persons may have smuggled poison to the depressed man to aid him in an attempt to end his life.”  

I suspect that the “outside person” was his wife. Probably like, “ok you SOB, you want to die, I’ll help you.” 

And then there was a follow up article saying that the coroner decided that “he did not see any necessity for an inquest into his death” and he was “satisfied to say that he died from the effects of lye positioning and did not deem an inquest necessary. 

I have heard stories that my GG grandmother was a mean and cold woman. But to find out who she was married to and what her life must have been like, it kind of makes sense. Her husband’s first suicide attempt was to blow himself up with dynamite (no other details about that one) then the second attempt he drank iodine. She also lost a son in a mining accident three days before Christmas. He was working overtime to earn money for the holiday, and was crushed to death. 

A year after she died, her other son died “accidentally” while cleaning his rifle. I don’t believe that it was accidental, I believe that addiction and mental illness runs in that family. 

My great grandmother was wonderful. But I definitely understand why she didn’t want to talk about her family.

Advice,fqomd3d,t1_fqmh00g,1589518699.0,"I’m Upstate too and our region is starting to open back up this weekend and it’s pissing me off how my friends are acting about it. One friend in particular has continued going over to a couple other friend’s houses this whole time, her wife works with the public, so there’s that extra layer to it. Her wife has no choice but to be around those people, so my friend is possibly exposed to more germs because of that, and then still continues to visit people. And then she hears that we’re opening back up and she literally tried planning a little baby shower/ get together for one of our friends this weekend, like this all meant nothing and that everything can go back to normal now. I told her I haven’t even allowed my own family to come to my house and I haven’t been to theirs either. I’m certainly not going to start by going to a gathering at her house on the same weekend that the region “opens” back up. 

Everyone was being careful at first but I’ve slowly started seeing pictures on social media of people hanging out and acting like just because they wear masks, that they’re immune now. 

Maybe I’m overreacting, maybe it’s not doing much good for me to stay home, maybe it would be ok to visit my immediate family. But what if it’s not? I’m not willing to risk that."

I’d probably feel anxious all the time and on the verge of tears if my whole life was a lie too.

LittleFiresEverywhere,fqoepg5,t1_fq8ey7f,1589513569.0,"I definitely agree that Kerry’s acting gets a little annoying, but at the same time, I think it kind of fit. She was always on edge because she’s literally hiding a huge secret and lying all the time. So it’s kind of like she can never completely relax. So the fact that she’s always snarling or whatever makes it seem like she’s almost holding back tears all the time - which for this character could be true because her whole life is a mess mostly caused by her decisions. 

I do think Reese did a really good job though. Elena was insufferable and I do not like her, but I think Reese plays that character super well. Which is kind of cool to compare these kind of roles to Elle Woods in Legally Blonde or something."

I love reading, but I’m not great at picturing characters and places in my head, so a lot of times if there is a movie or show based on a book, I will look up who plays the characters and imagine them that way because it’s easier, and also because then I’m not disappointed with who they picked to play the characters when I do watch the movie. I always wait to actually watch it until I’m done with the book though. But there have been a few times where I watch first and read second because I didn’t know that the book existed.

LittleFiresEverywhere,fqocsk4,t1_fpdhqfv,1589512366.0,"I think Mia acts that way and takes it out on Pearl because she knows that she’s wrong but she kind of has to double down because she can’t go back and fix it. So she continues to justify her behavior. People get defensive and act shitty when they know they’re wrong but can’t or won’t admit it. Her past is constantly following her around and causing her to be this cold, defensive and untrusting person. But her choices got her there. 

I don’t like Mia, but as far as her stealing Pearl, I don’t think I would use that word. Another commenter brought up the point of birth mothers changing their mind on adoption once they have the baby, even after the adoptive couple has spent thousands of dollars, and it happens all the time. Mia is absolutely wrong in the way that she went about it and it’s unethical because that guy wasn’t trying to father Mia’s baby, he was trying to father his wife’s baby. And of course she shouldn’t have kept the money, or lied to the couple. There’s just so much gray area. I’m not justifying it or agreeing with it though. 

That’s what I do like about this show though, it pulled me in and I kept watching even though most of the characters are unlikeable. Everyone is flawed. But it was a good story to follow."

I’m nice to people at work even when they don’t deserve it because it works out better for me. It may satisfy me in the moment to tell them what I really think, but that’s short term. What it does for me in the long run is show upper management that I’m someone who can keep a cool head, or be counted on when things start getting crazy, etc. And that makes my life easier in general.

I’m nice to strangers, because who cares? It takes almost no effort to smile at someone when they walk by or make small talk with a cashier instead of being annoyed that she wants to ask about my day or comment on what I’m buying. Maybe she doesn’t have a lot of friends, who the hell knows. And maybe she’s someone who is letting the negative take over and she thinks people are shitty and me being nice to her made a difference? It probably didn’t, but what if it did? 

I try not to hold grudges because it does more for me to forgive and move on than it does to hold on to it. If I’m holding onto something that you did to hurt me, not only did it hurt me when it happened, it hurts me every day that I continue holding onto it. And I’m just letting someone who doesn’t deserve my time, take up all this space in my head. And what if that person doesn’t even think about me anymore? They’re living their life not caring about whatever this is and I’m STILL letting them affect me on the daily? No thank you to that.

Remember this: there are still good people in this world, the shitty ones are just louder. I understand the frustration though. There’s tons of shit that irritates me. There’s plenty of people that I don’t like. And there’s lots of opinions I don’t agree with. You see terrible people all the time. They’re always out there, front and center. But sometimes you just have to choose to change the way you look at things. I know that it sounds so stupid, but sometimes we can’t change the circumstances but we can change the way that we look at it or handle it. I can’t change those people, but what I can control is how I act.

I know that bad things still happen to good people. And I know that it seems like good things happen to bad people all the time. But in this day and age, people only let you see what they want you to see. So just because this shitty person seems like life is great for them, that may not be the truth. Maybe they’re happy, maybe they’re not. But that’s not for me to worry about.

I’m not a goody two shoes or anything, I just do not have the energy to care about everything. I just don’t. So I try not to care about the people who don’t deserve my time. 

I know it’s not that easy all the time. I know that life is hard. I’m not trying to pretend like I have some secret to living some happy life or anything. I struggle with plenty of things and I’m not some ray of sunshine all the time. But I do try to live by those things that I said up there and lessen my load where I can. 

Take care, friend."
TrueOffMyChest,fmr81yf,t1_fmqxhp2,1586316092.0,"I just want to jump in here. It’s a lot less stressful to not care what people think and not let their opinions affect you. I absolutely agree with that. But at the same time, don’t let people take anything away from you either. Don’t let bad people frustrate you so much that it takes away things that make you a good person. I’m not saying that’s what you’re doing, it’s just a good message that I like to spread. It’s the same idea as not being mean to people just because someone was mean to you. Don’t let the bad ones change you!"
insanepeoplefacebook,fmnv5jz,t1_fmmq6m6,1586236192.0,"I saw a post a few days ago about this. It went on this whole long rant about how “we didn’t want him because he was perfect, we wanted him because he was the man to get the job done.” One of those post acknowledging that he’s done shitty things, but justifying and excusing every single one of them."
insanepeoplefacebook,fmnuu7z,t1_fmn1krs,1586235931.0,"This is exactly right. He made it acceptable to be openly hateful. These people feel empowered now. He has truly made it an “us vs them” mentality where they feel that when Trump is being criticized, they are too. So they still back him up because they feel that they’re being attacked and have to defend themselves as well."
insanepeoplefacebook,fmntwjw,t1_fmnedql,1586235168.0,"I think you could accurately say that not every Trump supporter is a racist, but that every racist is a Trump supporter."
90DayFiance,fmnp64m,t1_fmnh98j,1586231498.0,Exactly. Someone in the comments here mentioned how at least they’d be able to hang out with Angela if they had to. And I would have to agree. At least Angela laughs and tries to have a good time. Baby Girl Lisa is just miserable and bitchy and rude all the time.
SquaredCircle,fmjxiei,t1_fmjwlrv,1586139746.0,Me too! I thought “oh.... so I guess it’s not going to be like the Boneyard match” and I was disappointed.
pics,fmisskn,t3_fvd0nc,1586116186.0,"The egg reminds me of my great grandma. Every year we would visit her for Easter and my brother and I would bring her an Easter egg that we dyed and decorated just for her. She would put them on her dresser and keep them. She wasn’t affectionate or emotional, but she loved her family.

Thank you for posting this. It’s really sweet."
slowcooking,fm3581a,t1_fm2ufah,1585713191.0,"Tomato paste is super thick. It’s like a concentrate. So I guess you wouldn’t really need to substitute it with anything in particular. Anything like crushed tomatoes, tomato purée, or something along those lines and make sure you’re seasoning it enough. It will still be good without it."
estoration,flsi7pt,t1_flrkxek,1585442703.0,"Thank you! And yeah I definitely see what you’re saying. I was clicking through the other ones and some of those were good, and then I clicked on yours and thought it was by far the best and couldn’t resist messing around with it."
estoration,flq1a6f,t1_flovr8r,1585375345.0,"Hope you don't mind, I thought yours was the best, so I worked on it a little bit. Not because it really even needed it, but just because it shows that you really worked hard at it and I'm sure you looked at it for quite a while, and sometimes a fresh set of eyes are good for that kind of thing.

Wellthatsucks,flo660z,t1_flnwxl7,1585332328.0,"I live in the US and it’s always in movies and TV shows. It’s probably grandparents rings rather than parents because the parents are still using theirs, but the grandparents may not be due to one or both of them being deceased. So if the grandmother isn’t using her engagement ring anymore, she may pass it on to her grandson and then when he proposes, he can propose with a ring that means something to him.

Never actually had it happen to me or someone I know personally, but it’s common enough for me to be aware that it happens.

Edit: Ross from Friends was going to propose to Rachel with his grandmother’s ring after she had their baby."
TooAfraidToAsk,flnx907,t3_fpn7le,1585327610.0,"I was going to suggest Red Dead Redemption 2, if you have the means or plan to buy a PS4. My dad is 56 and that’s his favorite game. The storyline is fantastic, and if you die, you just get to start over at the last checkpoint and it doesn’t affect the gameplay. If you fail too many times and can’t pass the mission, after a few times it just lets you skip it and still move on with the storyline. You can go at your own pace with no one rushing you to keep going it start new missions. You can hunt or fish or just explore the land. You don’t need any knowledge of the first game. It has auto aim for the shooting, so you don’t have to be skilled in aiming. And it will introduce each new thing on the game you have to learn, such as shooting, jumping, running, etc. 

Good luck!"

food,flljq5g,t1_fllhgdp,1585261685.0,"Good question! I’m sure someone else could chime in and give you an actual answer. But if you already have the stuff, you could make a small batch and see how it turns out before you go all in."
food,fllha85,t1_flkkypz,1585260312.0,"A quick cheater way to make these is to use pre made biscuit dough in the can. Break each biscuit into quarters and just roll it into a ball and fry it. Not as good as making your own dough but still better than donuts from the store, hands down. Put some sugar on them and they taste exactly like the donuts at the Chinese buffet."
NoStupidQuestions,fllfmel,t1_fllf96t,1585259409.0,"Oh wow. Stay strong, friend. This is tough for everyone. I hope we get it under control over here before it gets to that. We can still get take out from restaurants and go to grocery stores without limitations. Gas stations, pharmacies, grocery stores, stuff like that is still open. I’m personally only going out if I need to and being careful. Not seeing friends or going to anyone’s house. But I’m glad I still have the option to go to the store."
NoStupidQuestions,fllfgb6,t3_fphsik,1585259317.0,"I have a friend who is like that, who will say oh thank God it rained today so that I don’t have to feel guilty about staying in the house. 

But I do not feel that guilt. I don’t have kids though, so that probably makes a big difference for some people. I personally don’t care, if I want to stay inside, I do. Sometimes at the end of the day I’ll think like aw, man, I should have done something today. But it has nothing to do with guilt or not taking advantage of the weather."
NoStupidQuestions,fllesyw,t1_fllelwi,1585258966.0,"I’m not the one you were responding to, but I’m in the US in New York and we’re pretty much shut down but we can still go for walks and do stuff outside as long as you’re not in a big group. I mean I guess technically you could be in a big group, but you’re not supposed to be."

TooAfraidToAsk,fll7d8v,t1_fll6zd3,1585254982.0,I can agree with that. Thanks for your response!
TooAfraidToAsk,fll3zog,t1_flknj6o,1585253193.0,"I’ve read your other comments and I agree with most of what you’ve said. I don’t think he’s directly to blame and while I’m not a supporter of his, I’ve kept quiet on what he’s done during this stuff because I know it’s a tough situation and there really aren’t many good answers or good news to give.

Obviously those people should not have taken fish medicine or whatever it was. It’s not Trump’s fault that they were dumb enough to do it.

I will say though, that it was probably irresponsible for him to say, “It’s been around for a long time, so if things don’t go as planned it’s not going to kill anybody.” 

I get that it wasn’t even the same medicine, so the blame lies on the people who took it for that, but they thought it was the same. Bad assumption. But if Trump hadn’t said that, they wouldn’t have even thought to try it.

So while I certainly agree with you on a lot of your points, I just wanted to add that in times of desperation, people should be careful with their words."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fll0qzo,t1_flkyyx4,1585251455.0,"I understand what you’re saying. Obviously you should plan properly. But people don’t always make the best decisions, clearly. So I’d rather have someone end up having to sleep in their car than to drive home. Both are not ideal, but I’m just saying if you had to pick between the two.

Edit: for the record, I’ve never had to sleep in my car. But I know a lot of people who have made poor decisions because of drinking."
BlackPeopleTwitter,flkv944,t1_flkrzck,1585248325.0,"Easier said than done when you don’t live in a big city. Absolutely still don’t drink and drive. But before uber was a thing, it wasn’t so easy. The town I grew up in had one cab company. And there’s always people talking about “if you ever need a ride, just call me!” And then those people are sleeping and don’t answer. Again, not saying to drive and drive, ever. Just saying that sometimes your only choice in the moment is to sleep in your car."
NoStupidQuestions,flk803k,t1_flikt3l,1585235789.0,Just wanted to let you know that this was my first choice today and I enjoy it so far. It’s very British of them to have only made biscuits and bread so far. Lol! But I definitely like it and I’m going to keep watching. Thanks again!
NoStupidQuestions,fljvtt9,t1_fljn0hz,1585227959.0,Good idea! Thank you!
