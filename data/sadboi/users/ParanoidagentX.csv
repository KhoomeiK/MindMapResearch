schizophrenia,fr50n7r,t1_fr4zv9t,1589900375.0,"Yeah, it's definitely a coping mechanism for me, too. Unhealthy for sure. It was getting to the point where I couldn't control my drinking like I'd buy a fifth and tell myself half today, half tomorrow only to kill the whole thing in a night, black out, get on my roommate's last nerve and do it again the next day lol üò¨"
schizophrenia,fr50bic,t1_fr4zw3i,1589900210.0,I was ready to blow my brains out after a string of suicide attempts on Buspar. Stole my dad's gun and everything so when I got hospitalized the doctor committed me to a state hospital and it sucked! After 2 months I was so over it.
schizophrenia,fr4z1ne,t1_fr4ykfe,1589899551.0,"Oh yeah, SSRIs put me in *ugly* mixed episodes. My first med was that and I had to be hospitalized for 6 months starting this whole terrible business. I was in the hospital like 2 months ago and they said schizo for sure ü§î"
schizophrenia,fr4yoo3,t1_fr4wgu3,1589899364.0,"Nice, they just gave me Librium which put my behind straight in that bed haha I got barbs at one place I detoxed at which was really nice. I probably didn't need the detox but they were worried because I had a seizure in the past from withdrawal.

ü§£ü§£ü§£ Right??"
schizophrenia,fr4xxg3,t1_fr4vum2,1589898967.0,Right haha my doctor thinks I have bipolar disorder instead of the other. Not sure if I agree with it but I'm doing well without the antipsychotic so who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

schizophrenia,fr4vbia,t1_fr4rzfz,1589897568.0,Thank you! Where are you from that they let you use the internet? I've never been in a place like that in Florida. Alcohol withdrawal sucks though being surrounded with beautiful souls makes it better. Good luck to you on your journey as well.

schizophrenia,fq9x9d0,t1_fq9wndr,1589208835.0,Thank you. It's a pernicious pill. I'm persnickety when it co.es to the pills. I have tried Invega. The sinister shot. Oh yes. It made me lactate. There are lawsuits for that.
schizophrenia,fq9whdv,t1_fq9w1o0,1589208411.0,Oh yes I know all about Clozapine. My grandma was on it before she died. It killed her. Severe constipation led to a bowel obstruction that perforated causing septicemia and massive organ failure. Yes. They tried to put me on it once. I would take Haldol and Thorazine again before that pill passed my lips. Even Prolixin. Anything. Not that. I watched her die.

SamandTolki,fq0uup4,t1_fq00qee,1589037935.0,The very last thing I would want to do as an individual with PTSD is film myself in a state that he claims to be in. This is so insulting especially since he is a confirmed liar. A key symptom of PTSD is avoidance. People who are really suffering aren't constantly talking about their trauma. It's pretty common for abusers to falsely claim to be victims for sympathy and manipulation. He is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
schizoaffective,fpw4se0,t1_fpvipym,1588957250.0,"That makes sense and is relevant to my experiences. It's like anxiety on steroids. I always thought I went psychotic during panic attacks but it's like you said, the anxiety is like dumping gas on a psychotic fire."

schizophrenia,fpm0v7d,t1_fplzcmh,1588723278.0,"I will try that. I take a small dose as it is, so small I doubt it's doing anything. Just slightly worried about going psychotic. It's a blessing I didn't cause harm last episode against the object of my paranoia."
