Assuming you can use the same drives that work in ATA machines, I'd recommend mSATA--I don't have any experience with CF cards, and personally don't like them as they're not that cheap, compared to mSATA and other solutions.

Another thing you could try, since it's all just .pkgs anyway, what if you do the same asr with a leopard install dvd, and just swap out all of the packages (/System/Installation/Packages) and see what happens.

I'd suggest testing the newly copied install cd on a Snow Leopard capable mac.  That way you know the permissions are all set up properly.  Otherwise throw in a -p on the copy to keep permissions.

You could also try using Disk Utility to ""restore"" the .iso to the usb drive.  That should give you a clean copy of the contents as well.

If you can convert the iso to .dmg, you can use asr:

    sudo asr -source ../file.dmg -target /dev/sdwhatever

Also, just test intermittently. As I mentioned, see if you can boot from the copied installer on an intel machine. See what results each of those steps give you. See if you can boot it without the BootX file--maybe the BootX file is for your install.

I believe I have to have the 7600 ""Log in"" to the MacMini running Tiger (other direction doesn't work), and can then copy files over.   When I'm done, I disconnect the Mini from the 7600, and shut down the Mini using ARD.

Now I just connect a USB cable to the SCSI2SD and to my MacBook Air.  Copy files over to the OS 8.6 HFS+ partition, and then boot into 8.6 so I can copy over System 7 needed stuff to the HFS partition.  It's really worth it."

Then, booting off an install cd, Disk Copy can be used to make image of the System 7 volume (Menu: Image -> Image from Volume).  That image can then be copied over to the SD card from Sheepshaver.

Then all you need is to boot the 8500 off the iBook Install CD, open the .img (backup essentially) and drag everything over to your System 7 volume.

That way, I have a fully working System 7 install, and if something goes wrong, I can either copy over needed files, or just nuke the entire partition and copy everything over from the backup, and I don't need to worry about reinstalling needed apps or extensions afterwards."
VintageApple,fpn811v,t3_ge1fup,1588753441.0,"while it's a little expensive, I really suggest getting a SCSI2SD. It will make a *world* of difference. 

I put one in my 7600 with a 32GB SD card, set up for two 16GB drives, and it is glorious.  If I want to transfer files, I just need to take out the SD card and pop it in (or just connect the SCSI2SD via USB to) my MacBook Air and I (would) get USB3 transfer speeds!

If you're able to boot off an iBook Install CD, that means you can access the SCSI2SD.  A rather dirty solution would be to set up the SCSI2SD for two partitions--you can do that on a windows machine I believe--just leave the SD card in the SCSI2SD in the 8500, and connect it via usb to windows.

After SCSI2SD has been set up, you can boot the 8500 with the SCSI2SD, booting off the iBook Install CD.  Then, you format one partition to be HFS (not HFS+/HFS Extended), and the second should be FAT/MS-DOS format.  If MacOS can't do, you should be able to do it on windows.

Once that's set up, you have one partition that your windows PC can access without problem, and the (future) boot partition. 

Then I recommend a Mac emulator called Sheepshaver.  It'll let you run Mac OS and work with Mac OS files and can help you get a System 7 installer on the SD card, and you don't need to work about loosing Mac OS ""resource forks"".

The MacintoshGarden should have Sheepshaver compilations/installs for the various version of MacOS. Just grab one, add the harddrive file to Sheepshaver's preferences, and set the transfer partition of your SD card as the ""unix root"" (though it may be called something else in windows).

The MacOS Anthology DVD (which can also be found on the garden) should include a .img of a System 7.6 install.

Basically the simpliest thing to do, would be to open the DVD image on Sheepshaver, and copy the System 7 .img over to the ""unix root"".  It's important to copy from Sheepshaver so that the resource forks on the .img are not lost.   

Once copied over, you can exit Sheepshaver, eject the SD card, put it back in the 8500, boot it off the iBook Install CD, and open the System 7 .img and install System 7."

If you notice a specific flower (like 0-0-2 purple mum) has only 0s or 2s in its gens, they it will *always* produce the same flower when paired with eachother, or like the purple tulips, if it has all three varieties of one gene (0, 1, & 2) and the others are all 2 or 0, then all purples will always produce more purple tulips (either 2-2-0, 2-2-1, or 2-2-2) when paired with eachother.

https://aiterusawato.github.io/guides/acnh/hybrids.html - explains how to reliably get the various colours, in the simplest(?) way possible. Really nice guide I will say.  I prefer its gene notation of letters (RY,wy,etc) better than than numbers myself.

https://aeonsake.gitlab.io/acnh-flower-breeder/ - a really nice breeding simulator.  When you combine two flowers, it shows *every* outcome, not just the sought after version.  That way you know what to expect, and you can also experiment to guess what genes your current flowers have now, if you can trace their lineage, and also plan out reliable methods for getting specific flowers.  I really like it.

VintageApple,foujv8i,t3_g9gb5l,1588085404.0,"I have a soft spot for Jaguar, as it was the first version of OS X I used, and imho looks the best.  But 10.2-10.5 all have great features of their own, along with some downsides:

10.2: looks great (love the non-sunken close/minimise/resize buttons) & very functional, but very outdated, and doesn't run everything.  ARD 2 supported, which I think can still ""control"" classic macs. Runs perfectly fine on my G3 notebooks (clamshell & pismo). 

10.3: runs MacOnMac. I don't like how they started taking away the pinstripes, and made window controls sunken. I have a love/hate relationship with the Panther & Tiger Finder sidebar. 

10.4: great support, for OS 9 and a wide range of newer OS X apps.  TenFourFox supported. Quartz Screensavers supported (I think?) Support for most if not all Shapeshifter themes.  Unified titlebars are sweet.  Support for latest(?) PPC ARD and I can easily control it using lated macOS build. But no hardware icon over the network. (can somebody hack that in?)

10.5: talks with modern macOS and provides hardware icon over the network. ARD installed by default. But I hate the dock. & no classic. I generally like Leopard, and I would like to like it more, but the lack of classic, and ugly dock are *such* deal breakers for me.  If somebody could hack in classic to Leopard, I'd consider using it again.

My MacMini is running Tiger and OS 9.  

My G4 PowerMac has too many partitions, and has copies of OS 9, Jaguar Server, Tiger, and Leopard.

My clamshell iBook and PowerBook G3 Pismo are running Jaguar and OS 9, though since I outfitted both with mSATAs I made a ""testing"" mSATA that includes 8.6, 9, 10.1(?), 10.2, 10.3, 10.4, & 10.5.  So I can play around with it all, when I'm not spending all my time outside of work on my animal crossing island.

I remember back in high school, I told Apple I was a teacher, and got a copy of Jaguar for free.  And when Leopard came out, I drove up to the Apple Store in Chicago to buy a family edition.  Unfortunately, I didn't take *any* of them with me when I moved to Europe, but I've since bought myself a copy of Jaguar (in box!), ARD2 (because Jaguar support) (in box!), and System 7 (also in box!)

If I can get a ram upgrade for my 7600, I might try and get Jaguar on it."

ac_newhorizons,fofhkth,t1_fofe5yj,1587736047.0,"nope.  I thought that too, but each flower is calculated independently.  When it rains, I usually get a bunch of new flowers.

But when it doesn't rain, and I only water one flower, that flower has like a measly 12% chance (assuming nobody else waters). Basically that means you have a 12% chance of getting that single flower to (assuming you only watered one flower) duplicate itself.

If you water two flowers, they each have a 12% chance of breeding.  And if you water every flower on your island, then every flower has a 12% chance to breed. 

According to the data miners, what's really nice, is the percentages stack day over day until the flower breeds.  So if you have bad luck, and get nothing out of your pair for multiple days, somewhere around day 10 they're basically garanteed to breed.

And if visitors come over, the chance to breed increases. Up to like [5 visitors water your flowers, each has an 80% chance to breed/self-duplicate](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1anxm3WwEKyh0_-l_lZIAUETaa_q432Px3griacQ3NcU/edit#heading=h.stbpgzp15qpn)"
