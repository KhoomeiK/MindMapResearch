BPD,eugx694,t1_eudbbet,1563816543.0,Dr Daniel Fox is amazing.
BPD,eugwv94,t1_euexek7,1563816380.0,You could have both. Adhd is very common in people with bpd.

BPD,et1u0xg,t3_c9rila,1562403841.0,"I go through this with people in general. Idealization phase and then devaluation. It's a very bpd thing. Not saying you don't have reasons to change therapists, I'm sure you do, but going from obsessed to numb seems black and white thinking. Use this situation to work on this emotion and its outcome. Try to see her as just an average therapist. She's probably nothing special, just like everyone else"
BPD,et1ts4i,t3_c9rila,1562403694.0,Did she disappoint you in any ways? To be fair majority of therapists is pretty average and its up to you to kind of lead the conversation and work on the things you wanna improve. See her as a tool. Also maybe this will pass and you love her again in the future. Who knows
Borderline,esttner,t1_ess2syp,1562273292.0,Than you for your kind words. I really appreciate that.

Borderline,eskd9rt,t3_c75jti,1562060602.0,"I don't feel like putting the other person down. I in fact feel like they don't like me all the time. I feel like the one no one else wants.

So my mission in life is making them like me cause I feel constantly rejected and need reassurance of their love. It doesn't make sense to me putting someone down so they believe no one else wants them, that doesn't resonate with me, but I understand some people do feel like that. Every BPD person is different I guess. We all have different struggles that manifest in a variety of ways.  


I'm sure many people can identify with this too. We're all different!"
BPD,esgvh6j,t3_c6iwzp,1561969010.0,"I take Abilify and I feel really good. But the intensity of my emotions is still high but the anger is less explosive. I sleep better and I feel less intense anger when I have an argument with my partner. The over thinking and paranoia, dissociation and intrusive thoughts and rumination is almost  gone. It's my second month and I take 2.5mg."

ADHD,ep3zyc6,t3_btvv3k,1559031428.0,Constant boredom and the need to be on the go. Otherwise life is meaningless.
ADHD,ep3zvwy,t3_btvv3k,1559031394.0,I can't cope with interpersonal relationships. I usually screw up cause I have over reactions to things and a lot of anger outbursts. I happens fast and I don't see it coming. Don't even know if that is my ADHD related dysregulated emotions or just another mental illness on the list. I'm about to give up.
TwoXChromosomes,ep3zhio,t3_btx93m,1559031203.0,"I totally agree with you. And I'm a woman and I feel embarrassed when a gentleman feels like he has to pay for what I eat in a dinner date, being it a friend, family member or whatever. I think it's up to us women grow some balls and stop being so entitled thinking that it is OK to exploit men and that it's the role men have to play in society, cause it is not. We do not live in caves anymore! And many of us do it deliberately and in so many ways. And it is not just paying for the drinks, it goes from opening doors to having to initiate contact or even sex. The average woman actually does little to nothing in a relationship. Good example is sharing the bill in a restaurant. Splitting the bill is the appropriate thing to do. Period. Men need to stop feeling pressured to pay for what their ladies consume, and that is down to us stop being entitled bitches. And no, chivalry is not paying for someone's food, it is treating them with respect."
