AmItheAsshole,fr012fv,t3_gli8p9,1589780661.0,NTA my 4yr old son has the same problem. He won't eat half the food in the house. I've tried making him foods he likes that he asks for but then he'll turn around and decide he doesn't want it anymore. I tell him no all the time but as hes growing hes becoming more demanding and stubborn. So I dont quite know how to handle him either. Honestly with a kid like that its easier just to give them what they want however its not the way it needs to be handled. If you ever do figure out the solution let me know.lol.
oneanddone,fqotusg,t3_gjuf9e,1589524690.0,"I sometimes think about having another one but then I see how difficult it is just raising my 4yr old son and think ""I deff couldn't do this again."" I picture my son running around the house getting into stuff while my newborn is crying its eyes out. 

Im still traumatized from my son's birth via C section and all the pain and agony I was in with shit nursing staff at the hospital I delivered in. 

I'm reminded of how tired I was day and night and how much it took to just get through the day. Not to mention the gestational diabetes that made me as big as a balloon itchy and in pain. 

I have a few reasons why it would be nice to have another kid but I also have a million reasons why it's not a good idea. I'm done. I dont care if my SIL wants me to have another and I dont care if my MIL wants me to have another. I. don't. want. to. I know what I can handle and physically and mentally I can not handle birthing and raising another child."
thingsmykidsaid,fqoss5w,t3_gjk1jt,1589523776.0,My 4yr old son tells me sometimes he has a brother or a sister. I am 100% not pregnant and if I can help it I will never have another kid. My son is more than enough for me. It kinda makes me nervous sometimes but he also tells me about the dinosaur in our backyard so I'm not too worried.
AmItheAsshole,fqkbflu,t3_gj5dib,1589423854.0,I was told when I had my ultrasounds up ubtil the last one I was having a girl. I was so excited. Then at the last one they told me it was a boy. I admit I was a bit dissapointed at first. My fiance made it out like I hated my kid because he was a boy when we were fighting one time. But I got over that really quick and hes 4 now and I wouldnt trade him for anything. My fiancee has brought up trying to have another so we could try for a girl but I'm done having kids. I had a terrible delivery and a difficult  pregnancy so needless to say I'm kinda traumatized from that.
AmItheButtface,fqka86r,t3_giv8bw,1589423161.0,YTB. Honestly if your planning at any time to move in with another male you might as well get used to it. Unless you guys can buy a big house with two bathrooms by yourselves you'll be sharing your bathroom (even with yalls guests). I share a bathroom with 5 other family members 4 of which are males. My mom has one all to herself that is only occasionally used by others. Guys can be messy but he cant control his bodily functions so if his shit stinks then it just stinks. Im sure your shit doesnt exactly smell like roses. Keep a plunger and airfreshener in the bathroom. I'd suggest getting one of those ones that sprays stuff every few hours. I can understand being anal avout stuff like that but its unrealistic to expect anyone else to be. He deff should have talked to you instead of just ignoring you first but expecting him to run to a bathroom that isnt the closest one is stupid.

AmItheAsshole,fqfra4i,t3_gidv7c,1589330155.0,Id say he'll probably treat that woman the same as how he treated your mom. Plus pregnancy makes you miserable especially in the last trimester. Not saying she isnt a bitch but usually there's always a psychological reason for it. No excuses. The whole situation  is fucked up. That baby however isnt asking to be born into y'alls life so it isn't it's fault. I say get close to the baby and try to make it more like you and less like its parents. You dont have to forgive your dad or her but imagine having a small little one who looks up to you more than anything. Honestly I think that would irke that woman more than anything else you could do. I vote NTA but I'd seriously think about stuff.
RBNChildcare,fqfo0r4,t3_gikiw9,1589328387.0,If you have a decent sized backyard I'd let them run around out there for a while. If you have a phone you can use the stop watch on it and make a game. Time them in a race maybe. My son is 4 and he loves to race around a bush we have in our yard. If you play video games and need a break teach them how to play. Watch movies with them. Turn the lights out with some popcorn and watch Frozen or something. Make a pillow fort. Try to have fun. Discipline wise you choose your battles. Time outs are effective. Look up super nanny on youtube. She has some amazing tips on how to deal with children in different ways. And long term maybe even though your not their mom maybe you can introduce a more structured environment if you want. It never hurts to learn all you can about children in case you decide to have them in the future or are presented with a situation like this.

Even before that he was in and out of my life. When I was a kid I always had this lingering thought that maybe my dad didnt love me either. I think my grandparents tried to explain but I had a hard time anyway. When he came back after my papaw death at 13 I still asked him every time he was about to leave if hed come back. Hes been in my life ever since. Growing up I dont think I truly realised why what happened happened until I became a mom. Be honest with him. Let him know that mommy is having some mental problems and that she is going to a place that'll get her help. Tell him that she does love him but she needs some time to get her life together so she can be a better mommy.

I lost her around the end of elementary school. Then it was a porcelain doll I named Claudia but I developed a phobia of dolls that got worse the older I got so I put her away.

You shouldn't have to be his mommy too you already have kids. If it were me I'd send yours and lil ones clothes to the place that does it for you and make him do his own. If you have to spend money then spend it. If its neccessary it needs to be done. If he starts complaining to someone that you spent money to get your clothes washed and dried for you I'm pretty sure he'll look like an ass to pretty much anyone.
AmItheAsshole,fpdldjb,t3_gcoc8s,1588529275.0,YTA. Firstly I can understand how you feel. It sucks feeling like your not wanted by your own parents. However think of it this way. Your adopted sister was given up and has felt unwanted for a long time too. You've had the privilege of knowing your parents. The security of being around them. Of having been hugged and coddled by them. Your sister most likely has not. Teenagers are less likely to be adopted by a family as opposed to a young child or a baby. How would you feel being taken from your parents and given to someone else. Strangers who never watched you grow up. Never asked you if you wanted to be adopted in the first place. Never told you how hard it was gonna be trying to fit into a family that you feel you never belonged to in the first place. I'm sure she misses her parents. Thinks about her mom. She never asked to be taken away from her family even if it was for her own good. Just like you never asked for a sibling. If she were biologically related would that even make a difference? What's the point in making her feel bad? I'm sure she doesn't need you for that she can feel that way all by herself. She's feeling bad enough as it is. Why don't you talk to her instead of being mean? Maybe you two can find some common ground. Help her make her own friends so you don't have to share. If you get her confidence up instead of breaking her down she'll be able to strike out on her own and do her own thing. She's your sister now whether you like it or not. You dont have to like her or even love her but dont go out of your way to hurt her. That just makes you into an ass. She's trying to hold on to anything she can to be included. So include her or ignore her either way dont hurt her. I think it would be cruel to ignore her but if you really dont want to be around her then just leave her alone.

I was a Tom boy and still kinda am. As long as my son is happy and not hurting anyone he can do what he likes and watch what he likes. I'll even put a but of eyeshadow on him when he asks or paint his nails. I think it should be more acceptable to be who you are and not defined by your gender."

SuicideWatch,fn4tzeq,t3_fz9b5c,1586648929.0,"I used to think my son 4yrs old. Would be better off without me. That my fiancee would be better off without me. But thinking about it now. NO ONE would love my son the way I do. I may make shitty decisions sometimes and I'm not the best at parenting because he's my first but I love him with all of my heart and I will protect him with my life. If my fiancee wants to leave me for being who I am he can but my son loves me and in my world he's all that matters.  When you became a parent it stopped being about you. I know your feelings are still important but like for me when I think of ending it I imagine my son hearing that he'll never see his mother again. I imagine him asking for me and my fiancee having to deal with telling him that Ive went to heaven and he won't be able to see me anymore. It kills me. So I work on myself. I have my down days still but I try so hard to be there for him when he needs me. I put him before my own feelings in my self terminating aspect. I know my feelings are legitimate and they matter but to me my son's happiness and his wellbeing matter more. I urge you to keep going. Your son needs you weither it's apparent or not. He will grieve for the rest of his life if your gone. He'll always wonder what you were like, what you would have thought of certain situations as he's growing up, he'll need your comfort and your advice as he gets older. He will always need you. Always. I know my son needs me even if he doesn't act like it. Even if my own brain says otherwise. If you go now you'll miss so many important events in his life. His first days of school, his first crush, his first gf, his first fight with his gf, his graduation, his wedding. All these important things. Even when he becomes ok with you being gone it still won't be the same. For those parents that actually care for their kids there will be an emptiness there. And it'll always be around. It's one thing to go if you can't help it. It's another to go if you can. Life will get better. You will have good days. As long as you try to find a way. Sometimes you'll have more bad days than good and sometimes you'll have more good days than bad. I know how important being a parent is to you. As much as it is to me. I know you love your son. As I do mine. So sit down and think deeply about things. Talk to someone if you haven't already. If you need to start taking medication to help ease the darkness. It's a long war. It'll always be a long war but tiny victories are a start. It's hard living with depression. Even for non parents and to have the extra added pressure of being a parent. Sometimes it may seem impossible. But it is possible. It really is."
TrueOffMyChest,fn4jxh8,t3_fz4cxp,1586642903.0,"What I don't understand about cultural appropriation especially with other cultures like Native Americans was the with men especially long hair and braids were important. Some tribes would have 2 braids while others had 3. When they were made to assimilate into white culture their hair was cut to a more ""appropriate"" style. But in native culture the hair was only cut short when someone they loved passed away. I'm of mixed heritage. Native and Mexican. I wore my hair braided almost all of my childhood. I didn't end up cutting it short until I absolutely had to. I would get headaches really bad. But I've seen tons of white guys with long hair and tons of white girls with braids and not one person sees that as inappropriate. Which confuses me. Honestly I like cornrolls and dreads and stuff like that. So I'm confused as to how those two cases are different because both Black and Native culture put so much Cultural significance into hair. So if it's wrong for other cultures to wear dreads or the like then why isn't it wrong for white men to have long hair or white girls to wear braids? I'm not being racist or sympathetic to people like that I'm genuinely honestly curious why we can't just wear our hair the way we want to? I know there's significance to hair but I'm trying to understand. I don't have any qualms with someone who isn't Native wearing braids or a guy having long hair. I haven't quite grasped cultural appropriation as of yet so I'm still learning about these things. So can someone explain to me how those two things are different? Please and thank you."

But he's so wild all the time and barely listens I'm surprised whenever he puts something he learns into practice. It's like a kick into reality. I had my first epiphany when I found out I was pregnant and it got me thinking that I would need to make changes in my life. And what the impact of me being pregnant really meant for me. 4yrs later and I'm still realizing certain things about being a parent. Despite how hard it's been he's made me so proud. He's very strong willed and hard headed. I hope in time he'll calm down and learn to use those traits to his advantage.
Parenting,fn1iw8s,t3_fykg7x,1586562962.0,When my son was a baby he rolled off our couch in his sleep. Scared me half to death. Idk how many times I've accidentally bonked his head against a wall carrying him to bed after he's fallen asleep. He was 3 is 4 now. He got longer and our doorway is narrow. He's even tripped across the bed tryin to play fight and hit his head against the wall dozens of times. He's fine though. Still trying to potty train but other than that he's doing everything like he should. He's not afraid to jump off high places or climb things like a monkey. Kids almost fearless. But the first time he rolled off the couch and onto the carpet as an infant my heart almost stopped. It was like watching it in slo mo but not being fast enough to stop it. I never left him on the couch by himself again after that till he was old enough. I was always afraid of him getting hurt as a baby. He's was always so energetic and curious.
AmItheAsshole,fmu5zve,t3_fx7mnf,1586385220.0,I don't think you quite know what the concept of adult diapers is for. I understand you were trying to help her but she can't just pee in them without changing. For someone her age its more useful if she accidentally leaks pee or if she has an overly heavy period. I don't see the concept as humiliating because I grew up with my grandma and I'm used to the idea. I had to use them when I had my son and still do sometimes. Having a kid messes with your bladder and stuff sometimes. I can however see how someone might see it that way. If you want her to feel better take her to the doc and see if they can change her meds or maybe just treat the side effects. I personally don't think YTA but my opinions are kind of different than most people's and I can see why what you said could upset people.

Parenting,fmq926n,t3_fwle4a,1586295164.0,"My fiancee was kinda like that. He was against makeup in general. Also nail painting which is one of my sons fav things to do. We started out with clear polish and eye shadow. My fiancee was resistant at first but he tolerates it more now than he ever has. My son's only 4. Like I explained to my fiancee if he wants to do it let him do it because chances are he'll grow out of it. If not then that's ok too. I fight for my son's right to do whatever makes him happy. As long as he's not hurting anyone. Even with my own family. They make remarks sometimes. But I stand strong. I can't say if your husband will ever change. But education and trying to do whatever you can to show him that it's ok is being in your son's corner. Even if it doesn't work. If he refuses to listen it might be time to walk away if you feel strongly enough about it to do so. It's your life. It's your child as well as his and just having someone there for him to know that he's loved is what matters. Some parents lose their children when they refuse to accept the healthy things that make their children happy. It's hard to watch. It's hard to understand but educating someone or at least trying to helps you advocate for him. His interest in ""femanine"" things may have nothing to do with his sexuality and more to do with what he sees you doing and his want to mimic you. It's more of what he sees you doing and his curiousity. The bright colors, the paint like consistency, the way it feels on their fingers, and a whole other marriad of things that draws children of any gender to do things. There's no right or wrong answer. Children explore that's what they're supposed to do. That's how they learn. That's how they have fun. And sometimes it's annoying and we get angry but they don't mean for it to. There's a difference between guiding a child and trying to mold them into being what you want them to be. I don't push my son to put in make up or paint his nails but if that's what he wants to do I'll let him do it. He took his Barbie doll to the grocery a while back. If by chance he develops a love of makeup when he gets older I will discuss with my son what might happen and how to try to deal with it. The same for any other controversial situation he may find himself in. It's easier said then done but I will try my best no matter what his dad thinks. And if my fiancee finds he can't tolerate it then he can do what he wants. But I won't let him mistreat our kid. It's ultimately up to you to decide what to do but being by your son's side no matter what is always the right choice."

RBNChildcare,fmgrow7,t3_fv3gjb,1586056045.0,I had the fear that once I had kids if I got angry with them I'd beat them and abuse them like my birth mother did to me. I was terrified that Id become just like her. It wasn't until I realised that I'm not my birth mother that I stopped being scared. I knew I was better than she would ever be and I knew I might have issues but I wasn't near the horrible person she was. I have a 4yr old son now and although I may not be the best parent I don't beat my son or do any of the horrible things I thought I would. I try to discipline my child but also be gentle with him. I don't want him to become as fucked up as I am. One of my concerns as a kid was my patience and the way I could easily get angry. Growing up though I became more patient and less quick to anger. I always try to be self aware of how I treat my son so as not to be too harsh on him. Kids are a big deal. I kinda wished I'd waited a little later on in life to have him so I could be a little wiser but I was blessed to have him now. I'm by no means a perfect parent and sometimes I find myself yelling a little too loud or getting a little too angry and I always think about how I was treated and it helps me calm down. Kids will get on your nerves. They will test every part of your psyche. They will take advantage of every chance they get to get into something so it's up to the parent to approach the situation in a sensible way. It's hard as hell sometimes. HARD AS HELL. But having my son has opened up my eyes to new things and new realizations about myself. I can't say weither or not that you could handle having a kid. But the simple fact that your afraid of hurting your child or doing anything like what was done to you has put you on the right track. Its one of the things that will make you a good parent. If your really that scared then talk to someone if your not already. It helped me alot.
SAHP,fmgkke2,t3_fuxwpi,1586051085.0,I've had that problem too. My son sleeps with us in our room so at times when he's woken up early I've let him play Minecraft or watch whatever he wants while I get a few more hours of sleep. If he needs anything he'll wake me up and then I usually get up a few hrs later and get our day started. He's 4 so it's a little easier to keep him occupied. Sometimes if he gets bored he'll wake m up ever few minutes to do something for him or to show me something. I don't blame the poor kid. But feeling so tired you can barely keep your thoughts together hinders your parenting too. There's been times he's been outside to play and I've just wanted to lay on the concrete porch and go to sleep. It's then I have to remind myself of all the things that can go wrong and I force myself to stay awake. It sucks really bad.

Yeah he's a bit much but my kids learned alot from him. As a compromise between our kid and me and my fiance we have a small tv in our room for him to watch whatever he wants. We watch our tv and he watches his. If either one is what they really wanna watch then let them. Get a tv and put it in a room where they can watch it and y'all don't have to hear it. They're gonna want to watch stuff on repeat. I don't know how many times I've seen the same episodes of Peppa Pig. I hate that show but he loves it.
Parenting,flwn31o,t3_frfzch,1585557039.0,Don't stress. Take it easy and don't b afraid to voice concerns even if it's something small.
AmItheAsshole,flqzy9c,t3_fqi3ho,1585410034.0,"NTA. I honestly hate when people do this. Especially young ones. Even at 28 I struggle with raising my kid and he's 4 now. If she wants you to help her she should pay you. Unless it's some big emergency you shouldn't have to do anything for her. Once she becomes dependant on someone else she won't want to do anything herself. She has someone already so it's their responsibility not y'all's. 

You may change your mind once you spend time with the baby that happens sometimes but I wouldn't help unless I had to. I'm the type to parent any kid that needs it but not everyone is. And especially you being so young you shouldn't have to have that kind of responsibility when you didn't ask for it in the first place. Alot is gonna change for her she needs to understand that. Sacrifices are made when you become a parent. She layed down and helped make this kid so she needs to learn what the consequences are. 

Raising a child is never easy and they're not like toys you can just throw away once you get bored. I went through a whole thing at 24 when I found out I was pregnant. Alot of things in her life are gonna change and she needs to understand that. It's scary sometimes. Having someone help you and expecting someone to take over parenting when it's convenient for her is too different things. A short trip to the store is different than having you take care of her kid all night while she goes out and parties. Your still young and you have a life too. I hope she learns to take responsibility for this child. It kills me when people don't see children as anything other than something to own."

AmItheAsshole,flqvp18,t1_flnbuiy,1585407313.0,Oh deff. I don't EVER want to go through that again. Adoption would be the only way I'd ever have another kid. I stopped having an appetite after my son was born. I went about 3 months having to make myself eat. I lost tons of weight. Then once I got my appetite back I gained everything back plus more. 😒 So now I feel like a soggy cow. Even 4 yrs later. I wouldn't trade him for anything though. It's just hard as hell now to lose weight. My cousin looks like she never had kids she's tiny. I get jealous. Lol. In fact most of the moms I know look great.
confessions,fln8g7u,t3_fpmc3a,1585312358.0,"I love this! When I was younger I went to a Chinese restaurant in a asian outfit and I'm half Mexican so I don't look asian at all I'm just pale and I had people come up to me the whole time I was there asking if I was Chinese and if I worked there. They wanted to take pictures of me. It was kinda creepy. They were all white people too. I bought the outfit at a Goodwill store and fell in love with it. I wore it all the time.

Edit: The closest I could find to what the outfit I had looked like was a green Qipao. It didnt look exactly like one but it was close enough. The buttons were more to the middle than to the side. It had a slit down the sides. Went down to my knees. I wore black pants with it. I don't even know where it is now it's been so long."
depression,fln83sf,t3_fpovk1,1585312071.0,I'm proud of you! Baby steps. 💜
AmItheAsshole,fln4o9m,t1_flmjayy,1585308983.0,I had an emergency C-section. My pregnancy was mostly horrible. I felt like my pelvic bones were grinding together. I had the ungodly pain in my belly button that made me feel like my insides were gonna fall out. I ended up with gestational diabetes and blew up so badly by the time I went into labor I couldn't even fit in my shoes. My skin was so tight it hurt like hell. I had to be induced and every time they checked my cervix it felt like they we're sticking a hot poker in my hoohaa. I ended up with a fever and high blood pressure. I dilated to 9 cm and then it started to close back up. The contractions were so intense I thought I was gonna die. They gave me something to take the edge off but instead it just ended up making me so sick I barely knew where I was or what was going on. It didn't stop the pain either. I was literally in tears begging the nurse to help me. It was too early for the epidural but they finally let me have it anyway. It took the 9 tries to get it in my back. It was a little easier after that but by then I was so exhausted. I asked the doc when I was supposed to push and she said I was having a C-section instead. I cried a little I was pretty dissapointed. However by the time I was being prepped for surgery I was too tired to care. They had to restick the fluid needle in my hands about 5 times each because my vein blowed and they couldn't find a new one to put it in. I'd had to go without food or water for almost 2 days while I was waiting to go into labor. They gave me ice chips and I could suck on candy like peppermints. I was allowed one slice of pizza the whole time I was there. My lips were so dry from lack of moisture I had to constantly use lip balm. I was a mess. During surgery I was so out of it I'd fall asleep and then wake myself up snoring. If It wasn't for them jarring me when they took him out I would have missed his birth. I was that weak and worn out. Recovery was even worse. At one point I had to pee but they had blood pressure cuffs or something on my legs and my incision was like white hot pain. I couldn't sit up but I managed to slid one of the cuffs off. The other one was stuck and I'd asked the nurses to help me but they refused. Said I had to do it myself. I honestly tried because I didn't want to wet the bed. But I couldn't get it off and I was in Soo much pain. It took me begging two or three times before one of them finally came in and helped me. Overll I just had a bad experience and it was kinda traumatic and humiliating for me. So Im trying to do whatever I can to prevent it from happening again. I know it might be different this time but honestly I don't want to risk it. My son's 4 now and I don't want any more kids period. I went through postpartum too. Had to have a counselor come to the house and talk to me. My biggest pet peeve is my sister in law trying to talk me into having more kids. We can't afford to anyway and I'll be damned if I have to go through all that shit again. NO FREAKING WAY!
SuicideWatch,fln2nna,t3_fpn7fr,1585306888.0,I always said when I got really old and if I got too sick or too fragile I'd go ahead and end it myself. That way I can control if I go or if I stay. I've had a few almost attempts and alot of times I wanted to but now I don't really think like that much. I'm more focused on doin that when the time comes when I'm way older. I don't want anything to take me I want to be able to do it myself.
SuicideWatch,flld1fq,t3_fp9lis,1585258013.0,"Honestly being in a straight relationship isn't all that great either. If your parents are like I think they are it wouldn't matter is you were straight they'd still find something to be disappointed about and angry. You don't have to be gay to get bullied either. People hate people for all kinds of reasons and homophobia is just another excuse for someone with hate to spread that hate farther. People hate people cause they're ugly. People hate people cause they're good looking. Talented. Talentless. Fat. Thin. Promiscuous. Faithful. It doesn't matter what you are there will be someone somewhere with an excuse to be mean. I dont know what to define my sexuality really but I have male fiance. My parents know I like girls but they choose not to want to talk about it. I don't know what your going through. I wish I could comfort you somehow. My son is 4 and growing up I will accept him loving whomever he wants as long as they do right by him. I'm sorry your having such a hard time. But the reality is having a ""normal"" family isn't actually normal anymore. Most families are divorced now a days. I don't think I know of a single ""normal"" family. My dad is hetero but he's been divorced 4 times and can't keep a gf. I was raised by my grandma because the woman he had me with was an abusive pedo and he was too young to take care of me. Being gay or not doesn't matter. It isn't your sexuality that'll make you happy it's who you are with that'll make you happy. Even if it's just you with yourself. Even if you somehow became hetero there's no guarantee your life would be any better. Your parents might accept you then but then again they might find some other thing to hate about you. You loving yourself is all that matters. Accepting yourself for who you are and finding people who do the same are important. Just because you were born to your parents doesn't make them family. Family loves unconditionally. A stranger you've only known for 5 mins could turn out to be better family than your own. You never know. I know it probably isn't worth much coming from me but I'm proud of you for being who you are. For living each day. Even getting out of bed is a small accomplishment."

I still don't have my shit together either so idk. I try to clean but it always ends up right back to square one so I don't really have any advice. Living with 7 people and only 3 of them cleaning every so often is hard. Cause it always ends up dirty again cause a certain person in my house won't clean up after himself even though he's a grown ass man. My situations complicated. Anyway your lucky in a way. I'd give alot to be able to hire a daily maid. My mom wouldnt be so stressed all the time.
insaneparents,fkyiet9,t1_fkxeexd,1584649352.0,My fiancee is paranoid about the ingredients in a vaccination. He thinks it's what causes people to get sick. I think alot of people are just misinformed about what goes on during the vaccination process. Our son is vaccinated and he's fine. Always has been. The same with me. There's always gonna be a 50/50 chance something is gonna happen vaccinated or not. I just don't see why we shouldn't be safe rather than risk it. Vaccinations help. They don't hinder. I don't know a single person whose been negativly effected by a vaccine. Anyway they can make their own choices it's their life and their kids. We can't stop them.

Not that his actions were ok in any way but if he was smart he would have listened to his lawyers and plead insanity. It was a possibility he could have just gotten thrown in a facility. Better than prison if you ask me. He did the bombings because he was trying to save humans from technology. He was literally using technology.
insaneparents,fkwlre9,t1_fkw1jid,1584596541.0,Maybe that's one of the main reasons they're antivax because they feel that's their choice to make. Telling them they're kids need to be vaccinated is like telling them how to parent. It's quite juvenile really. I dont risk my kids health by not getting him vaccinated. It's a 50/50 every time something happens. I want to be better safe than sorry but Some antivaxers have legit concerns. Which I get. But I think most just do it to fuck the system. Idk.

Most of the time he'll watch all of a minute or two and then he'll be like ""Mommy change it"" and this will have 40 times a day. Doesn't even finish what he's watching before he moves on to another one. Also even if he isn't watching it his tv has to stay on or he'll throw a fit. I've taken to giving him my phone with the firestick app so he can change it to whatever he wants so he'll let me be. The best part though is he'll try to climb up my shoulders when I'm sitting every chance he gets. I love him with my whole heart but I don't love being a jungle gym."

So you could just go to the bathroom and scrub up. But to say you wasted her time and all that feels selfish and rude. So you took 10 mins out of your day to help someone. Is that a crime? It's not her money either it's yours. However I would suggest next time just outright buying the person something to eat or something they need that way you know where the money goes."
Parenting,fef9ccg,t3_eoutzd,1579051247.0,I'd say just to follow through on your threats. Take everything away if you have to. Don't show him any reaction if he throws a tantrum. He's trying to get to you. Talk to him about his behavior but be firm on what needs to be done. Remind him that good behavior can be rewarded. Even if you have to literally sit in the room with him make sure it gets done.

AmItheAsshole,facefhn,t3_e8incg,1575937919.0,ESH they shouldnt even be hooking up anyway the dudes 18. It may not matter to you guys but it will if the law finds out. 16 is only with the consent of parents and the other person is under 18 as well I'm pretty sure. Technically he's an adult. So he shouldn't be taking advantage of her. That's just my opinions though. Age aside I think it would have been better if they told you first. At least if they did that then you would have had time to process it and how you felt about it. Sure she should be able to do what she wants but he's still your friend and she's still your sister.

AmItheAsshole,fa6w1ns,t3_e7t57k,1575829129.0,I would never regret having my kid but I do wish I'd been older. In my 30s maybe. I had my son at 25 he's almost 4. He's a handful and so energetic. He climbs on everything and can be rough. I love him Soo much but I wish I could get a babysitter sometimes just to breathe. He'll go in my moms room and chill for a bit and that's a load off but she's not able to care for him much and I have to constantly worry about her falling asleep and him getting into stuff. She's in bad health. But overall I wouldn't change having him. I would just want to mature more before I had him. Able to be more tolerant and in a more stable place. But I did the deed and had him so it's on me to be responsible. I don't blame him for the way my life has gone. In fact if it wasn't for him I probably wouldn't be alive and if his dad left me today I would be upset but I could deal as long as I got to hold my baby and watch him grow. I love him more than I love my fiancee and my fiancee would say the same. He's the glue that holds us together mentally. If it wasn't for him my life would be very bad rn. But the experience is different for everyone. I don't think I'm cut out to be a mom but I'm gonna try the best I can. My advice for people is to wait to have kids. Until your ready. And if you don't want kids don't have them. Especially if your not mentally capable. Depression can come easy with having kids. I'm one and done. I refuse to have another as long as I can help it. My SIL wants me to have more. She's got 3 but I told her no. My own family doesn't even want me to have more and they adore my son. I'm just not mentally capable of handling multiple children. I know that. And my son's birth was a bit traumatic so I'm terrified of having another birth. All in all though it's not my kids fault how I am so I just try to make the best of it. He wants a brother or sister but he'd be happy with just a puppy.lol.
AskReddit,f9vb9nx,t3_e719kg,1575666552.0,"There was a guy named Leo in my town. I haven't seen him in a while but the story was he was a vet and was rich but wasn't in his right mind. He would walk around town in an old dirty war coat and talk to himself. I don't think he even realised there were people around him. I heard there would be a guy that would pull up in a car once a month and give him some money. His family tried to help but he kept leaving home and walking around town on his own so they finally gave up. Maybe they didn't really care? Idk. I remember as a kid my mom took me to a store and I didn't want to get out so she left me in the car and Leo had been sitting on the sidewalk in front of our car when we pulled up. I watching him for a good 30 mins just sit there and talk to himself. He made jerky movements too. He didn't even give any indication he saw me watching him from the car. Eventually he got up and walked off. I saw him maybe 3 or 4 times growing up. 

Then there was the Jesus guy who had a van covered in religious signs and he would park in random places in town and hold up Jesus is coming signs for hours. He smoked weed and I think he lived in his van. A few of my friends back in the day said he was cool. They would find him and go hang out and smoke with him. 

Then there was my friend in highschool who thought he was Jesus and he was homeless so he walked around town carrying a sword and hitchhiking. I had no idea about any of this until I met up with him after we graduated. He used to dress like the dude from Assassin's Creed sometimes too. He was very weird but he wasn't a bad guy."

Parenting,f9lxid8,t3_e5nmm2,1575434697.0,I tell my son if he won't eat it he won't eat anything else. If he's that hungry he'll eat it Or if he eats it he'll get something else as a reward. We never starve him but make it a point to not let him waste food. If he doesn't help clean we take something away. Tv mostly since he's incredibly attached to it (though he doesn't pay attention to it 90% of the time.) Or for example I'll tell him I'll take his toys if he doesn't help. Always make sure every negative action has a consequence. You can also try putting him in time out. If ours does anything too bad he ends up in the corner with no tv. Reward him when he does good and have a punishment when he's bad. I can't guarantee it'll work every time. It doesn't with mine sometimes but it'll give him a better idea of what he should and shouldn't do. Also maybe try spending more time with him. He may just be doing it for the attention. Make sure he knows that negative actions won't give him the attentions he's wanting if thats the case as well.

I know my son wouldn't care if he got Christmas presents. Worst case scenario we'll get him something later when we do manage to get the money. Don't stress about it. My son's only 3 so he's not expecting much but I know with older kids it's more complicated. It's being with family that counts more than presents or anything. Maybe you can buy them some candy as presents? I'm not exactly sure what to tell ya but I totally understand what it's like.
AmItheAsshole,f9383k5,t3_e3f7tf,1575052281.0,"YTA My grandparents pretty much raised me and when my papaw died my grandma had a few dates. I hated it. It felt like she was trying to replace him and I wasnt the nicest myself. That doesn't excuse her behavior but you have to understand her situation. She's still hurting and taking away something that important to her isn't going to teach her anything. She's only going to grow more resentful. It'll feel like your choosing your gf over her and that's the last thing you want. Talk to her yourself. Find out what her problem is. Be patient and don't raise your voice. Tell her how happy you are and that even though she's in your life that's not gonna change anything. Apologize about her schooling. SOs come and go but you have your kids for life. They shouldn't be disrespectful but you also shouldn't stoop to their level. Your the adult and her parent regardless of how old she is. My dad wasn't around much in the beginning. But when he finally came home to stay he dated too. I didn't like it but he would always tell me that there were certain things he needed that his kids couldn't give to him. I don't really care now. My grandma doesn't want to remarry and my dad's gf came and went. You never know how long you and this woman will be together. It may be forever, it may be a couple more hours. But your kids are forever. You know that. You guys just need to talk. Get some communication going on. After she feels comfortable she needs to talk to your gf too. It's gonna take time and as long as your gf is nice to her she has no right to be nasty. She's lucky. All the women my dad dated when I finally got used to them and started to get close they left. At least your gf wants to get along with her. She needs to know that."
AskReddit,f935ui7,t3_e380ez,1575050652.0,I would have missed out on another year of my son's life. I would miss his first day of school next year. I would have missed his smile. His laugh. Every day with him is precious. I finally learned that. I'm glad I'm not like that anymore. I think about it sometimes but I'm not like I was. I'm thankful for that.
