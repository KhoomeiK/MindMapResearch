When i was in Elementary school i couldnt read. I would read pages and pages and not know anything i just read because my brain was so focused on others things i couldnt focus on what was in front of me.

When i wanted to die at the littlest bit of inconvenience in my life. Like i would drop my books or forget something and i had an automatic thought of ""im worthless i should just be dead"" when i was only 10-11.

When i started bringing extra socks and things to school because i would get so angry/anxious about being uncomfortable (i would sweat and my feet would get wet and i would be miserable all day, to the point i was unreasonable to be around, something that small shouldnt offset your entire day like it did)

When i would stay awake for days at a time and then have a mental breakdown over the smallest thing. 

When i first got my license and my first thought was how i could just hit a tree and it could finally be over without hurting the ones i loved or anyone else, not how fun it would be to hangout with friends and such.

entitledparents,fct2p39,t3_eiltzq,1577931317.0,"From a young disabled person, thank you for not using the handicapped space when your husband isnt with you. I can only imagine the amounts of spots taken by nondisabled individuals just because they drive the car of someone who is. It seems like there is never any spots and some parking lots only have 3 or 4 and they're always taken. I have issues with my condo parking lot all the time. People who dont even have a placard or a license plate handicapped symbol park there and the owner is too caught up in his own business to even care. It sucks."

But this way a stray cat i was feeding and was petting when a lawn mower started next door and it freaked out and attacked me. So it was nothing like the playful punctures i get from my 2 cats at home. I wouldn't worry unless its deep like this puncture.
