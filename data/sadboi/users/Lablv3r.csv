I live with it on a daily basis. Treatment DOES NOT END for me. I am on a chemo until it stops working and then start another one. I hope each chemo works for as long as possible. If it happens to work at all. I have been on several that have not and still had to deal with the horrible side effects.

Many women have been diagnosed early and later on still end up with stage IV MBC or unfortunately many women are diagnosed with MBC at the get go. 

I was first diagnosed with breast cancer at 32. I thought only women in their 70's or 80's got it. Boy was I wrong. 

Please check out metavivor.org to learn more about stage IV MBC.
