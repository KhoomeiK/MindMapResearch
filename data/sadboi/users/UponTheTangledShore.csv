 It's been less than 2 months since my stbxw moved out. We have three kids under 12. I lost my job in March and haven't been able to work since. She's been working so I've had the kids with me most of the time. I'm about to start a new job and I don't know how we're going to handle the kids since we'll be working at the same time.

I'm scared about the future. I know we're failing the kids; they deserve so much more than we can give them.

But I think things will be ok... hopefully.  As long as I can keep this new job and it covers all of my monthly bills, I think the rest will work itself out. Even this level of optimism is new to me but I have to recognize how far I've gotten in the past 11 months.

If I was guaranteed to get her back 100% as she is now,  I would do it in a heartbeat. I'd give up almost anything except for my kids to have my family happy,  healthy,  and whole again."
Divorce,f7we3ov,t3_dxp7ip,1574032413.0,"So... I guess more or less I'm in your wife's position so here's my experience and what I would have wanted.

Some background: I've been struggling with depression and anxiety all my life but rarely seeked medical treatment and never therapy until 4 months ago. I've(39m) been with my STBXW(38F) for 22 years, married for 12 of those. I isolated myself from her and our 3 young kids because I thought I was sparing them from my down mood/misery. About 3 years ago, she started cheating. I never knew and was completely blindsided when she told me 5 months ago. It's absolutely destroyed me. I THOUGHT I was in a 100% committed relationship, not happy, but we had each other and the kids. I never knew what I wanted in life, career, hobbies, etc but I knew I loved my family and we would grow old together raising our kids.  I've been hospitalized twice and attempted twice. She's also suffering from very bad mental issues and anger as all this started 3 years ago from trauma. She's been causing problems for our kids and I've been causing problems for her because I don't know how to move forward without her. But after 3 years of cheating on me she doesn't really care about me anymore. I see the pain she's in and how bad she is and I see how bad she could get surrounded by her enabler ""friends"" I don't want to a abandon her. If the situation was reversed, I wouldn't want her to give up on me either.

Current situation: we're still living together. I love my kids and need them in my life every day. Living paycheck to paycheck. Things are really bad right now. I am not ok. She basically kicked me out last night because I pissed her off but I'm refusing to leave. I didn't have a job for a year and a half until 2 months ago so I don't have any finances of my own to move out. I don't have friends or family to move in with. Mentally I'm in absolute hell right now. I want to not be ""here"" anymore. Even though I seeked treatment and I'm on medication, it doesn't seem to work long term.

She never really communicated with me besides simply saying ""you need to fix this"" and she never considered MC or IC for us. She just let our relationship die.

I've been struggling with the why ever since. She's a completely different person than the woman I fell in love with. I emotionally cannot let go as much as I try. I'm still hanging on her every word and approval. I don't want to, but even an angry glance from her will devastate me.

What I would have wanted: for her to have tried as much as you have. Seeing a therapist and really talking to each other would have been all I needed to try to save us before she cheated. If that didn't work and we gave it our best shot, I would have been upset but -I- would have been ok moving on undamaged.

So really, from my perspective, you've done all you can aside from an endgame gamble: hospitalization with divorce in the table. If she refuses to go, call who you need to have an Emergency Order of Detention done. She'll be hospitalized, will get direct treatment in a safe environment, time and space for both her and you and your child.

She may come out better for it and looking to get help for herself. If it causes things to escalate, you have to move to divorce and do what you need to do for you and your child. Reality will set in for her.

On top of that, I would suggest stopping from accommodating her. Don't ask her if she needs anything; she needs to ask. If she feels that you'll always be around, it'll be hard for her to realize what life would truly be like without you.

Obviously I don't have real answers as I'm in my own situation I can't get out of, but that's my perspective from a similar situation. She's lucky to have such a caring spouse that is invested in getting her help."

Some people that refuse therapy, like my STBXW, do so because they don't feel that talking to a complete stranger is worthwhile. They never really open up and therapy will never work that way.

Some people expect instant fixes and don't want to do any work. You have to be willing to listen and do the exercises and actually challenge your thoughts.

Over time, more details came out and she had been cheating on me for years with different people.

She manipulated her AP for money, and eventually tried to kill herself because of her actions, guilt, and self hate.

We're moving on, both trying to heal and be better, but she doesn't want to do any real work on herself and just wants to indulge in bad behaviors. She didn't learn her lesson.

 It's been 3 months since my wife came home, walked into the bathroom, and said, ""I might have herpes."" No ""hi"" or even a ""we need to talk."" I was completely blindsided but she had 3 years to cheat and fall out of love with me. I saw red flags but I never thought they would lead to infidelity or seperation. For maybe 2 years, she was less affectionate, distant, sex was tanking. I figured it was just because of financial stress and our 3 little cockblockers. I was completely emotionally supportive of her but she never opened up to me. She just stopped talking to me. But I trusted her and was patient. I thought she was going through her own issues like I was but would never betray me like I never would betray her.

For several reasons, we've been co-habitating and co-parenting our 3 young kids. I've had quite a few talks with her about what happened and it always left be feeling worse. I feel more of a failure and completely inadequate now than I did 3 months ago.

When we talked, she'd mostly listen to me, and then give me some insight into what she thought it did. But eventually she would start getting ""tired"" or get emotionally stressed and just shut the conversation down. She never liked talking about her feelings or the things she did that made her feel shame. She may have not been in love with me, but she still loved me and wanted to be a good wife.

Even though we're still living together, it's not the same. I have to initiate taking with her. Unless we're talking about her, she's incredibly short and doesn't want to engage. I think she would completely ghost me if she had a chance.

I've been hospitalized twice now, and I really only have a couple of friends I could talk to. The only family I have besides my wife (the source of my situation) and kids is my dad and I can't lean on him with this. He's frail.

She hasn't texted back all day today and something my wife said to me today triggered me hard. I -need- to talk or text her but I feel like it's too much for her to handle. Monday was enough, and I don't want to just unload everyday. It will hurt our friendship. I really don't want to be rejected again.

relationship_advice,ezbcv6c,t3_d0g9d1,1567818440.0,"I can't blame you for wanting to try to save your marriage. I felt the same way almost 12 years ago when she told me she had cheated on me. You feel like you're saving her as much as you're saving your relationship.

Just be careful and stay vigilant. She needs to put your trust concerns first before her own. Be sure you're both clear and open about everything. If she starts repeating the same behaviors that led to her affair, don't tolerate it.

Trust me when I say that you don't want to be where I'm at right now with a 22 year relationship that was never going to work and 3 kids I won't be able to see every day like I thought I would just 3 months ago.

I wish I could go back in time and convince myself not to get married. She was unhappy and cheating was an easy escape for her. I would never cheat, no matter how unhappy I was. She ""tried to make it work"" for 10 years but she gave up and found her escape again."
offmychest,ezb3cfg,t1_eyvqx49,1567812322.0,She's moved on but she sees what she's done to me and feels guilty. I am very isolated which makes this all the worse. I'm trying to make progress on my own but it's slow and everything else is moving faster than I'd like.
offmychest,eybryuy,t1_eybmsnb,1566990688.0,"I wasn't always a stay at home Dad. This was just in the past year and a half. And before that, except for 6 months after my mother died and 6 months after I lost my long term job, I've always been employed. Even if I had continued working, it wouldn't have mattered. She cheated because it was easy for her to do. She cheated because she's a weak person with terrible insecurities that's afraid of confrontations. She cheated because she was never truly honest of her feelings for me; she didn't love me as much as I loved her, and she hid that from me.

In her eyes, I failed as a husband and didn't do enough as a father. I agree. I didn't do enough to better our lives. But she held me to a high double standard that she didn't make clear to me. I forgave her for her mistakes and loved her regardless if she was successful or not. All that mattered to me was that we were together and loved each other. She felt differently and didn't show it until 2 months ago..."

We also got together very young and eventually married. Three kids under 10. We're in debt and living paycheck to paycheck on her income alone. We don't know if we'll have enough for rent this week. Right now we have about $10 till payday. Our marriage is broken, she ended our relationship 2 months ago, I'm mentally unstable and suicidal, and she's falling apart. I can't work or let her go. I can't heal. I can't go back or go forward. Our kids deserve so much better. They're so sweet. I love them so much and it breaks my heart knowing that they won't have what we've always wanted for them."

offmychest,ey7xrir,t1_ey7nlx5,1566905023.0,You're right on target with her sense of self-worth. Something happened to her that made her feel great shame almost 3 years ago and she didn't tell me about it until 2 months ago. She's been in a downward spiral since then and I was oblivious to it because I trusted our marriage and her ability to work things through. She sought escape from me and the kids instead of addressing her issues directly and it only compounded the problems. My heart is saying not to give up on her. I wouldn't want her to give up on me.
offmychest,ey7x9kw,t1_ey7qqop,1566904496.0,"She's been unhappy for some time and her unhealthy double life was, and still is, her escape. She's not confronting the issues directly but just running away from them. Unfortunately those issues include the kids. I had been hoping she would realize she needed help and become willing to accept medication and therapy but it's been a very slow process. I suspect that the constant lying and hiding the truth from me and the kids is weighing heavily on her."
offmychest,ey7wz8p,t1_ey7nd5h,1566904183.0,"I do talk to her, it's difficult. I tend to become overly emotional and talk too much and she's the opposite.

I've even spent a week inpatient. I know there's something really wrong with me. All the coping mechanisms don't help my problems. I need someone in my life in a physical presence to help me I think. Someone I can talk to everyday and hold me if need be. I'm still alive because of my kids but I just can't keep doing this with her.

Divorce,ey41nmu,t3_cvf98g,1566779429.0,"Your situation is very similar to mine. I was/am the depressed husband and my wife ended our relationship 2 months ago. She was overwhelmed with everything as well but wasn't communicating with me at all. She took three years allowing her love for me to die silently while I was completely oblivious that things were that bad. I knew she was going through a tough time but trusted the strength of our marriage.

Looking back, I wish she had talked to me before she crossed lines. I was completely locked in my head with depression and anxiety but if she would have been honest and explained how she felt and put ""Divorce"" on the table, I would have woken up (as I did 2 months ago but it's too late now.)

Have that hard talk with him. Don't let your marriage die in silence."

Divorce,ey2sk76,t1_ey2npea,1566747329.0,"I wish someone had told my STBXW this 3 years ago. She let her feelings for me die without a fight. I was completely blindsided because I trusted her and thought she was just stressing about work/finances.

AsOneAfterInfidelity,exn4pfh,t1_exn1b03,1566446214.0,It did light a fire that had gone out long ago. I just couldn't believe she would say that to me after 22 years together.

Divorce,exm5clb,t3_ctjdb2,1566424801.0,"My STBXW and I are in the same situation but it's only been 2 months since the separation/DDay. I'm the BS but she's the one ending our relationship. I still try to do nice things for her because it hurts too much to be cold to someone I love and known for 22 years. She doesn't quite have a problem being cold but she does put in effort to be friendly and considerate.

We're going to be living together for a long while co-parenting our 3 kids. We need to be genuinely friendly if this is going to work. We can't let the kids down again.

And yes, it's incredibly confusing to me. I start sliding into old feelings and feeling hope. I'm sure it's confusing for her too on a certain level, falling into old habits."

survivinginfidelity,exlihyq,t3_ctkkkp,1566413647.0,Just block her. Do whatever it takes to stop you from looking. I had to do something similar because I was obsessively checking records. I'm much better for it.

survivinginfidelity,exkkrv4,t3_ctg114,1566392452.0,"Maybe it took years of quiet resentment and unhappiness for my wife to feel it was ok to cheat on me for the last 3 years. She did it anyway. I wouldn't have and never will. No matter how unhappy I was, I just wouldn't cross that line in our marriage.

She told me ""I care less (about you) than you possibly think."" That's not the woman I fell in love with.

Cheating is an absolutely selfish action taken by broken people that put themselves before anyone or anything else.

We deserve better."
survivinginfidelity,exkh5pb,t3_ctf5gr,1566389350.0,"Unfortunately there isn't a way to just stop thinking about it. It just takes time for the frequency to lessen, like grieving the death of a loved one. Your original perception of your wife is gone. And you have to reconcile that she lied to you for 8 years.

My wife had confessed to cheating on me before we were married, but we had been living together in a ""committed"" relationship when it happened. Like you, I focused on it daily and it tore me up. It took a few years before I realized I hadn't thought of it in a while."

relationships,exjt3er,t3_ctas2u,1566359597.0,"This sounds familiar to me. Your hope is that he eventually pulls his head out of his ass and realizes that he needs to put work in to keep you happy and engaged with him. Being married does not guarantee your continued presence. If you explicitly stated to him what was important to you (like cards) that he isn't doing and he still ignores you, you have to decide how much you want to keep the marriage. Ask to separate for some time apart and see what his reaction is.

What's his reasoning for ignoring your issues? In my case, I was being extremely  cheap wanting to save our money or spend it on our kids gifts. When I brought up the idea of not getting gifts for each other, she didn't object. But she resented me incredibly for it. Granted, I could have put effort into anything to show her I loved her but I didn't. I took her for granted, and I absolutely regret it at this moment.

FYI, having kids will not fix this. In fact, having kids will only make the eventual consequences of this behavior infinitely worse. Source: me."

Taken my time with her. Slow danced, even if the music was in our head.
