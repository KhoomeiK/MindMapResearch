I started showing signs of Agoraphobia when I was around my senior year. I would avoid going out and socializing with people, but I still had a job and handled the day-to-day routines fine, but little things would disrupt my day and I'd have pretty intense panic attacks. I took the bus to work, I held my job fine for the most part which had a lot of social interactions, and as long as people didn't acknowledge me I was fine outside. 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar right after I graduated, and I was in an extremely abusive relationship for a few months when I first started medications and that was when my comfort bubble shrunk pretty rapidly, I refused to go very far out from my neighborhood.

I was officially diagnosed with Agoraphobia after a couple incidents involving gun violence. I'm pretty much housebound unless my wife takes me to the mall or out to dinner, and even then I have pretty bad panic attacks and some anxiety meds I take. I'm not sure if I have actual Agoraphobia, or if it's just PTSD from the gun incidents. But, it's on my medical records.
