yoga,fr1sikz,t3_gm4pzw,1589825185.0,"I think it’s extremely common to come into yoga through asana and slowly find yourself more interested in the mindfulness and spiritual aspects, just by nature of the practice.

I’m sure some purists will come downvote me, but if you are getting physical and mental benefits from asana, you are not missing the point at all just because you aren’t interested in reading yoga philosophy. The idea of yoga is union - to join body and mind. An asana practice that leaves you physically and mentally calm & strong is just that, and is the goal for most of us!

I practiced asana for a decade before starting to explore mindfulness and the yamas and niyamas, which I do find helpful, practical tools & frameworks to see the world. I’m not so into the subtle body or the sacred texts but maybe that will come with time too. 

It’s your yoga - if you never want to think about a chakra, no one will force you! But if you find yourself drawn toward the mindfulness/meditation aspects of practice, why not explore a bit?"

I think a lot of people we know get help from parents, or are waiting on an inheritance, or both.

blogsnark,fpw4hzl,t3_gdefhu,1588957110.0,"I need bathroom help! Below are my woes:

1. Mildewed grout (the rubbery kind sealing the wall tile to the tub). I saw someone below suggest Tilex?
2. We have glass shower doors in metal runners (aluminum, I think?) and I can't get the runners looking decent. Grimy, sort of rusty/discolored - I've scrubbed with normal cleaners and used Barkeeper's Friend.
3. ANYTHING used in the sink - toothpaste, face wash, hand soap - leaves a gross film on the drain & stopper. No luck w/ Barkeeper's Friend. I don't want to wipe the sink 30x per day and haven't had this issue in other apartments. 

I feel like I might just be using the Barkeeper's Friend wrong? I apply, leave on for a minute, rinse off, then clean with something else to buff/remove that gritty feeling, but I see no difference."
blogsnark,fpw3lpm,t1_fpvnul5,1588956668.0,"I completely agree about the obedience & accidents. There's such an emphasis placed on the dressage, and the horse who is taught to be submissive and obedient enough to get a 20 in dressage in a stressful atmosphere is less capable of stepping up and taking over to save its skin if/when the rider makes an error going XC. 

Lower level jumpers are totally terrifying too! My trainer now always says, we don't ride to win at .90m or 1m. You're never going to beat those maniacs galloping around, don't even try. You ride it correctly and for the experience and then once you move up to 1.10 or 1.20, those folks wash out and we start to win.

The worst is the 3'6 at the Hampton Classic. It's the lowest height of jumpers they offer, and it's such a big-deal show that everyone wants to ride there... so 75% of the class is people who have never shown at that height who just bomb in the ring and scare the shit out of everyone. So, so scary."

blogsnark,fpty4mg,t1_fpt6r3t,1588900628.0,"Yeah, I was definitely raised with that “grit your teeth and make it happen” attitude toward riding which is useful when you’re having a hairy moment on a baby horse but... maybe not so useful in an unprecedented pandemic. 

The trainer I grew up with with actually quit eventing and switched to just doing jumpers because she felt the sport was getting too dangerous and people’s attitudes toward it were disturbing. This is someone who competed internationally when everything was long format, on OTTBs she kept at home. Super old school. And she was just like, “I’m freaked out, I’m done here.”"

blogsnark,fpt7id9,t1_fpsydpo,1588886226.0,"There will definitely be data on that because a LOT of people left the city in mid-March when it became clear we’d have a SIP and everyone would be working from home. And people have been trickling out since then, Taza-style. 

The point I’m trying to make is that people weren’t “fleeing” in late Feb unless they were extraordinarily paranoid. That was normal work/pleasure travel occurring. I felt a little extreme stocking up on Clorox wipes in Feb, and we only did that because we had family in China putting the fear of god into us. My boyfriend went on a business trip to CA around that time and we didn’t think much of it at all. 

In retrospect the shutdown should have happened a lot sooner, but in late February folks in NYC people were just barely getting an inkling of how severe this was going to be. No one was bolting to the Hamptons for at least another few weeks."

I don't feel like my therapist and I are communicating much differently but I am realizing that having a physical space where therapy happens, that is separate from the rest of my life, is actually really important to me. It's weird to finish therapy and just... walk into my kitchen! 

Plus I'm in an apartment and it's just impossible to get actual privacy - either I'm in the apartment and my boyfriend can hear me, and half the time he forgets I have therapy so he just walks in - or I'm on my deck where my boyfriend can't hear me, but all my neighbors can. So... my neighbors know a lot about me now."
blogsnark,fpt3hj2,t1_fpssqal,1588884215.0,"I was an eventer before moving to NYC and then ended up at a jumper barn because there's no decent event barns within like, 2 or 3 hours of the city so I VERY much get the eventer mentality, haha! 

The benefit (??) of H/J culture is that the horses are in full training so they're actually much fitter now during shutdown with only our trainer riding them - they are basically at boot camp. Is the eventer argument for keeping the horses fit because they are anticipating having a show season this summer? Like... seems pretty unlikely, your horse is probably loving having a vacation from trot sets."

I 100% get how you feel about that show - that's what bothered me when WEF kept running shows. If people with plenty of money and fancy doctors want to endanger themselves, then fine, go ahead. But that's also endangering all their staff who probably don't have health insurance or sick days, and might be undocumented and scared to go to the doctor. But, you know, who cares! The horse is going so well lately, let's get that fifty cent ribbon! "
blogsnark,fpsqs2k,t1_fpsj011,1588878027.0,"Yes, I saw a similar thread if not the same one. My friend got a positive nasal swab very early on, and then a negative antibody test last week. Maybe her body had cleared it, maybe she didn't develop the right level, maybe the tests are just kind of wack at this stage! 

I am sure I had it - now I have to go get the antibody test just to let you all know what happens, haha!"

blogsnark,fpsqfi0,t1_fpsjj14,1588877857.0,"Yeah, that makes sense. I'm sure a lot of people who had a cold or the normal flu are going to get an antibody test assuming they had covid. 

I was very sick for 3 weeks and while I never got a test, about 6 (?) doctors told me they were sure I had it, so I am curious to see how the antibody test comes back. I believe I had every classic symptom except loss of taste/smell and GI issues. If it comes back negative I will still assume I had covid because ... what else could it possible have been!? 

My boyfriend (who lives with me) and best friend had much milder symptoms than I, so my guess is that possibly they just didn't develop the right level of antibodies. Maaaybe my friend didn't have it, but she spent a week in one of the earliest hotspots and then lost her sense of smell/taste for a week. I feel in NYC the occam's razor is more like: if you had the symptoms, and you had an exposure, you had it."

blogsnark,fpson3f,t1_fpslycw,1588877001.0,"I'm in hunter/jumper land so maybe not all disciplines are quite like this, but there's also a real ""the rules don't apply to us"" streak that showed up with SafeSport that is showing up again now.

There has never been any real outside oversight over the industry (ie, the actual government, not USEF/FEI/IOC), and a lot of people benefit from that. The bubble of privilege and money around the sport makes people think they are untouchable. So when that oversight does show up, they are SHOCKED and feel like their rights are being infringed upon.  ""How will our sport SURVIVE if 14 year olds can't live unsupervised with their trainer in Florida for the winter?"" I don't know, Karen McHunterPrincess, but every other sport in the country has managed to comply somehow, I'm sure we can figure it out. ""How will I keep CLIENTS if they can't come to the barn for a month?"" I don't know, Joey Jumper Trainer, but every small business in American is in the same situation and ""break the law and let them come anyway"" isn't it!"

I feel like Cuomo is getting a boost because de Blasio handled it even worse than he did. And he does put together a coherent presser. In a crisis we want to see stability and leadership, and he managed that. But long-term I do not think people will look back fondly on how Cuomo handled this. The tide is already beginning to turn on him now that there’s data on how an earlier shutdown could have prevented a decent % or cases."
blogsnark,fpsjlpv,t1_fps5li7,1588874565.0,Please go on! Do you mean that the virus was brought in from Europe to NYC via the airports and then spread across the country from there?

blogsnark,fpsih4a,t1_fpsen4e,1588874026.0,"Yeah I’m sort of like... I feel like I should get the test but also there’s no point? I haven’t heard of anyone I personally know who had classic symptoms and then a positive antibody test but that’s anecdotal. 

We were told not to go in for it until 14 days post symptoms to allow time for the antibodies to show up. I’m now something like... 6 weeks from start of symptoms so 7 weeks from initial infection? So maybe I have antibodies now and maybe the test will show them! Who knows!"
blogsnark,fpsi2w1,t1_fpsg0ju,1588873840.0,I think it’s around that range - luckily our insurance will cover it because I’ve torn through our deductible already this year.
blogsnark,fpsggk7,t1_fps8l18,1588873057.0,"Riders are acting SO badly. Everyone at my barn (in NJ) has been really respectful about the shutdown but I'm hearing so much about barns still secretly operating. My trainer told me a few days ago that one of our vet techs went to another farm to do spring shots, realized they hadn't closed AT ALL and had boarders and leasers coming in and out all day, and just turned around and left. The practice had to call them and say 'none of our vets will step foot on your property until you've been closed to boarders, leasers and lessons for 2 weeks.' 

I think privilege has a ton to do with it. The people who spend $2k or $3k a month on their horse just aren't accustoming to hearing no.  WEF was still running shows after the FL shutdown (and one of their employees then died of covid), and people are trying to run unrecognized shows in TX this month, which is a violation of the governor's orders.

I miss riding and the barn desperately, and I do think in the grand scheme of things it's one of the safer activities for transmission - tons of fresh air, outdoors, not much contact with others. And I understand barns run on tight margins and even if your barn is 90% full board and training, it's tough without that lesson and show income. But it's a hobby, AND one propped up by under-insured, often undocumented immigrants. 

We have a groom who is precious to us and my trainer does cover his insurance but it's not great, so my barnmates and I told him  that we'd cover his medical costs if anything happened to him and if he wanted to return home to his family in Central America at any point, we would pay for it. But I think our barn is the exception and not the rule. My desire to enjoy my LUXURY HOBBY is not worth endangering his health, or my trainer's."
blogsnark,fpscsbv,t3_gf4i9d,1588871291.0,"NYC - I guess I'm going to go to CityMD this weekend and get an antibody test?

It seems like a waste of time because the tests don't appear very accurate, but I also feel it's sort of my duty to at least make the effort. I assume it'll come back negative and I'll have to go back in another few weeks when some better test shows up.

I am a domestic adoptee and have two birth certificates - my ""original"" one, which I  cannot access, and my legal birth certificate with my adoptive parents names, which was issued in the state my parents lived at the time of my adoption.

She must have a USA birth certificate on file with SOME state, and she can request a copy of it. Her passport should serve as proof of ID. She should start that process ASAP in every state her parents might have done the paperwork in. 

It's a bit concerning to me that her parents don't recall where they lived when they processed her citizenship and also lost all the documentation and paperwork? If I were her I'd probably speak to a lawyer, too."
