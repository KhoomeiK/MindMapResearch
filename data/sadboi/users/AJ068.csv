My older sister has it worse than me, sheâ€™s in a wheelchair. But she gets disability, which was a nightmare for her to get also. I donâ€™t know that I have any life lessons, donâ€™t drink alcohol or do drugs! Do the best you can & treat people how you want to be treated. One life lesson I guess Iâ€™ve learned is for the most part people donâ€™t give a shit about others, especially close members, even if they say they do. We live in a â€œme first â€œ society today."
