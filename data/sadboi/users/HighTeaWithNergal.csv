According to OP, the mother said it would be fine when apartment manager brought up the issue.

If there were issues, the mother should have brought it up at beginning before moving in and should have either requested another unit if available or simply not live there at all.

I would say the mother is 100% wrong. Yes babies are fussy and can be colic and cry for hours on end, that sucks. BUT the mother was the one who signed the rental agreement or bought the place. She knew what she was getting into, she just lacked foresight. That's all on her."
