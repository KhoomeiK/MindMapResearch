For those unaware, the incident involved the sheriff trying to move possibly healthy people to the medical wing against their will, then using K-9, officers in riot gear, and pepper spray to quell any resistance.

The sheriff fucking claims that the detainees attacked the K-9 dogs and caused $25K in damages. Have you ever seen those dogs?! They attack humans, not the other way around. What a lying shitbag. Only imbecilic, riot-gear-clad redneck high school dropouts can cause that kind of damage."

Some ideas:

-	relaxing attendance policy or allowing you to submit a short assignment to make up days missed


-	relaxing participation standards or allowing you to submit a short written answer in place or class participation (useful for depression)


-	having lecture notes provided to you instead of having to take notes (memory/concentration)


-	preferential seating, testing in an empty room, extra time in assignments (memory/concentration)


-	reduced home assignments, etc. 


I recommend looking over a list of all bipolar symptoms, then brainstorming how this symptom could affect you negatively in an academic sense. Everyone thinks ‚Äúmood swings!‚Äù But people forget about the memory and concentration part. 

Your goal is to create an environment - in and out of class - that goes *with* the way your brain works and not *against* it.
