Anxiety,ev2gk0a,t3_ci8l5f,1564176486.0,"I'm definitely up for this. I find it hard to talk to my close friends and family and, not meaning any disrespect, I'd rather someone that doesn't judge me or is aware of personal things that are irrelevant to my anxiety/depression.."
Anxiety,eu9823v,t1_eu973vc,1563573867.0,"Same, I sometimes say things that I hope other people like or want to hear  when in my head I'm holding things back."
Anxiety,eu91dy3,t3_cfctpv,1563569455.0,"Perhaps try going to the place you are about to start, be a customer and observe how the waitresses are working, find a friendly face maybe and introduce yourself so you're not just stepping into the unknown, try be comfortable with your surroundings and find a safe place there where you can take a breather. That's nothing wrong with going to the bathroom for a little break and taking a deep breath.

Good luck, you can do it! :)"
Anxiety,eu90vix,t1_eu906v4,1563569132.0,"If people get tired about hearing about your problems, they aren't the right people to talk to. It's probably a good idea to get everything off your chest to a new face (not a stranger on the street obv, they may just walk away... but someone that doesn't know  about your background, so it's like a fresh start, explaibing everything to a new person, they may listen and support you, and it may help you calm down.

Sorry if this doesn't help!"
Anxiety,eu90h7f,t3_cfcryh,1563568873.0,"Honestly, the best advice I could give you is to be patient. My husband has watched and observed me when I get really anxious and some days I need him to ask me something to help me think about other things (like name the characters off a show we recently watched) and then when I calm down, he holds me and says ""I'm here for you.."" but some days I just tell him ""please don't talk to me, my brain is in overload and I'm about to vomit."" He stays silent but still watches me amd squeezes my hand to say ""I'm not going anywhere"".

If your partner doesn't open up about his anxiety, it sounds like he's not ready, but that shouldn't stop you from observing what can help and what doesn't, that way you can prepare yourself and support him whichever ways suits him."
Anxiety,eu8zvc4,t3_cfcrc2,1563568472.0,"Ha, yes! Funny enough, I'm stuck in this vicious circle. I overthink, then I get anxious, then I calm down, then I overthink because I feel like my anxiety is geting worse, get anxious, then calm down... honestly can't win and have stopped myself and gone ""srsly?!"""
Anxiety,eu8zjiw,t3_cfcnk4,1563568252.0,"I do. I have a perfect husband, a cat that keeps me happy, things could be going really well but still get the urge to cry or get angry. I get random outbursts of when I just feel like I want to scream and smash something, but strangly the urge stops after 5 minutes. Not sure if this is something that is linked to anxiety and depression but afraid to say anything to anyone in case I get brushed off."
Anxiety,eu8uwdl,t1_eu8ua5c,1563565271.0,"I completely understand, I feel that if I write it in a diary, no one else will see it therefore won't know, only myself. And if I tell someone, and they say ""I get it"" or ""I'm going through this right now, here's what I do..."" etc, I feel a bit better, not because I'm happy someone's going through it as well (I wouldn't wish this upon anyone, even my worst enemy), but because they understand and I'm not the only one."
Anxiety,eu8ueos,t3_cfb73r,1563564951.0,"I'm trying to love myself and think of things that are good about me. Like for example, if i see a person, whispering and giggle to their friend, looking at me.. I try and tell myself ""my hair looks fab today doesn't it?"" Or ""just got this new coat, jealous?!"" that sort of thing.. and tell myself that I'm not a mind reader.. they could just be walking past and they just happen to be looking at you, like we do when we people watch etc. I hope this sort of helps?"
Anxiety,eu8ts1m,t3_cfbyn0,1563564542.0,"I'd like to know too as I'm finding it hard to write it down in pen, but want to share my stories and make new friends and support each other. Let me know please if you find this out :)"
Anxiety,eu8q3ai,t3_ceu91n,1563562190.0,Yes!! And I get shouted at for it.. people constantly tell me to stop it but I'd rather say sorry than make myself look rude or harsh!
