nhl,fm3guta,t3_fststh,1585723074.0,"Based on your description I have found two teams that could be good decisions. 

1. The Golden Knights jersey could be something for you. They are a young team, only three years old. Therefore they don’t have much history and it’s fine to wear a jersey of them without having any deeper connection to them. Also pretty easy to educate yourself about them. 

2. The other one that comes to mind are the Pittsburgh Penguins jerseys, as they are one of those NHL teams that people know (long history) and which have been playing well the last years (latest stanley cup wins are 15-16 and 16-17). There are quite a few bandwagon penguins fans either way because of that, so no one would be surprised if you wore their jerseys without knowing much about them. 

I also think the Bruins jersey look really nice.

Obviously I like my team’s jersey the most, Carolina Hurricanes (reaally exciting team) and I strongly suggest to take a look at that team as well. Good players with good chemistry and have been looking good and have impoved a lot the last two years after a long time of playoffs drought. A bit of un underdog and dark horse, maybe more of a dark horse than underdog this year."

No one is raising any frequency. I don’t quite understand what you mean and I’m not sure that you understand what I mean by humor either. By jokes, I don’t mean jokes about the virus per say. You can’t be miserable every day and think about everything horrible happening, that will do no one any good. It’s important to try to find some joy, or you will become depressed. For example, today in my country a part of the country got seperated from the rest in order to not spread the virus. People made jokes about ”the rest of the country being happy that they got seperated from those people from there, and thinking ”finally!””.  Then we have all the jokes made about people planning to shit in two months in a row, etc. As I said, it’s fine if not everyone likes people joking, but for many of us it’s important in order to get through every day.

One of the worst things I know when it comes to hockey is when people compare defensemen by talking about how many points they have. Sure, points are good, no question.

It’s different with players like Backstrom and Barkov who are on ’official’ lists of who the most underrated players are abd who have been seen as underrated for years. Yeah, they aren’t underrated anymore. But I find it very difficult to see how a player like Teravainen isn’t still seen as underrated.
