I feel like he could still be the center of the show even if he trained multiple rookies. Plus adding new rookies keeps with the theme and allows for people to be written off and fresh faces to come on if the show last for years and years.

Another option would be for Nolan to change jobs. Maybe hes a training officer for a season or two. Then a detective or swat for a season or two. He would then be a rookie at each new job and be the focus. 

I do feel like they had to have an idea of what they were going to do if it lasted more than three seasons"
