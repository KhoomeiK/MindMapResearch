depression,faj64i7,t1_faigt13,1576125601.0,Honestly if I could rebind ptt + chat and could double bind (especially weapon switch) I'd be playing it all the time.

Anxiety,fagu0er,t1_fafxf2c,1576071240.0,"Hmm could you talk to your coach about setting up and getting to a doctor appointment? If you want to go off course. Or even a school counselor or nurse might be able to help. Whichever you're comfortable with.   

I find writing things down before conversations like that help a lot and if you find it hard to speak during you can hand them the paper instead"
Anxiety,fafvry5,t3_e90db2,1576033122.0,Have you talked to them or a therapist/doctor about it? Could help both parties if they knew what you were thinking
Anxiety,fafv4pt,t3_e8z671,1576032649.0,I'm free every day most of the day if you want to pm me. Sometimes I forget to check reddit though if that's an issue.

Dyslexia,f80gb4p,t1_f7zr8ef,1574128355.0,Hell yes. I used to do yard work while I listened to random books.
depression,f7xi592,t3_dxwkuo,1574058525.0,"Completely unrelated to the topic but I've been saying ""anywho"" for like 10+ years. I thought I was the only one.    


Related to the topic I have very similar experiences to what you're talking about.     
 Wait a second. Are you me?       



Also does this comment look weirdly worded to you? It sounds weird to me after rereading."
depression,f7xhz4h,t3_dxvdfm,1574058327.0,Since I've gotten back on Facebook the last couple years I've tried to reach out to a bunch of old bestfriends and gotten maybe one or two responses with no inclination of wanting to continue the conversation from their end. I know I've been away like 7 years but damn the amount of people straight up ignoring is bonkers.

Agoraphobia,f7vnj0i,t3_dxs4lv,1574025392.0,"I find yelling/screaming in the car helps a little. Or I play the ""well fuck it I'm already..."" game.       



>aww fuck I'm already in the car might as well drive to the doctors

etc.     


Sounds stupid, because it is, but it works for me."
depression,f7vmo95,t1_f7vjku7,1574025112.0,26 here. We should start a club and never talk because we're too fucking depressed.
selfhelp,f7vlg3z,t3_dxpvzl,1574024729.0,Sounds like you need a break/vacation. Also sounds like you could benefit from therapy and/or couples therapy. Not sure I can be much help with motivation sadly.
MMFB,f7vh90y,t3_dxrh8s,1574023726.0,It *could* be that they think you don't like or want to text them.
SuicideWatch,f23a4f1,t3_dbguee,1569912928.0,I really want some nice potato soup now...
Anxiety,f232y5b,t1_f21cire,1569904231.0,That's awesome man! On the same at 160 ER. Every now and then it'll stop working early or I'll miss dose and it'll suck for a little while lol.
Dyslexia,f232ta5,t1_f20pet6,1569904102.0,Good luck! Hopefully you can work something out! Let me know how this gets resolved. I grow strange attachments to random internet strangers.
SuicideWatch,f232qeo,t1_f1ymzmd,1569904024.0,"That is very true. Could result in losing phone/tablet/any joyful activity left. I had some awful counselors in my time. One told many students to ""just drop out"" big yikes."
Agoraphobia,f1yldrq,t3_db2zxc,1569818728.0,Let me know if you figure something out. Went from 6'2 150 thinking I was super fat to 250 and feeling/being super fat.
Dyslexia,f1yl0f1,t3_db4po7,1569818453.0,You could probably still ask. They may be willing to redo the videos with different variables or possibly send you via email a changed variable equation you can look at during the lecture question part.
Anxiety,f1yi7v6,t1_f1ygtqq,1569816800.0,Yesss.. I remember trying to show my gf at the time but it basically never had to crack when she was around :(. I had bp issues before my weight. Now I have double BP issues yay!
SuicideWatch,f1ygxgx,t1_f1sqjij,1569816094.0,You should be able to get a temporary fill from your previous doctor. If not (and if possible) the ER should be able to help until your new doctor is able to see you.
SuicideWatch,f1ygm1t,t1_f1yf1l0,1569815921.0,Guidance councilor or assistant principal may be able to help too. Good luck OP.
Anxiety,f1yg9qu,t3_dau2pa,1569815745.0,Not sure if you'll see this OP... but a random sorta friend that I talked to for like a year and I were talking about anxiety and panic attacks and stuff and he told me that his mother reminds him that the heart can't feel pain and that's resonated with me since. So now every time I feel chest pain I remember what she said and try and stretch my back out. 10/10 times it's my back/pecs being sore. Now I'm no doctor but I'm pretty sure it's legit. I don't remember nerves being around/in the heart. Though if anyone is reading this and knows otherwise I'd rather stay ignorant of all that. Thanks lol
Anxiety,f1yfpix,t1_f1vtjms,1569815430.0,Oh shit I can pop my sternum so loud sometimes. And it feels so good. Thought I was the only one who did this
Anxiety,f1yfiy9,t1_f1vm6gf,1569815335.0,Sounds like you need to get some BP meds. I was around 200 bpm after relaxing in a chair for an hour. Walking up/down stairs or doing anything remotely stressful would make it way worse. Shit sucked. I'm surprised my heart didn't explode after years of no bp meds. Seems to help my anxiety a little too which is nice. Unless you're talking about during a panic attack... I'm an idiot sorry
Anxiety,f1ofs8f,t3_da26id,1569643968.0,Hey man late reply so not sure if you'll see this... Writing things out and having it to remember things or even give to the therapist helped me out a few years ago when I went. I should go again but idk money and all that
SuicideWatch,f1ofd67,t3_da70tq,1569643534.0,At this point I'm too much of a pussy to do it. I stopped caring what would happen after about 2 years ago
Anxiety,f1ofabr,t3_da4bsr,1569643454.0,If my anxiety didn't physically stop me from feeling anything I'd probably still have my old job. I can still remember my hands stopped working mid transaction (register) and I had to run to the freezer to cool off for half an hour.
depression,eyan0oi,t1_eyakd8h,1566965810.0,My ankles will perpetually crack so I do this in bed every night lol
depression,eyamvuk,t3_cwfiss,1566965747.0,Honestly the more you worry the worse it'll get. Distract yourself with a repetivie game or memory if you can. Card games or mohjang work well. I like to play infinitode (tower defence game that's super basic and not flashy) or think about playing soccer as a kid. Good luck
depression,eyamdz0,t3_cwfisg,1566965539.0,You should plan to tell your supervisor what's happening to you. Definitely write it down in case saying it out loud it too hard. I know I have never been able to talk about my depression or anxiety. Also schedule a doctor's visit immediately if you haven't seen one recently. If you call early enough in the morning there's a chance you could be seen that day due to cancelations.
depression,eyald3i,t3_cwfjz9,1566965096.0,I feel the exact same way. I've never told anyone in my real life how depressed I am or that I want to kill myself. I have been to the doctor though. The fucked up thing is I think what made me go was the thought of it costing more to reschedule or something and having them schedule next one at the end of the visit and repeat rofl.
Anxiety,eyajowb,t3_cvzqjk,1566964378.0,"In highschool I was talking to this girl and she asked me if I liked anyone. I of course responded with a ""yes a few girls"" in which she responded with an ""oh"". We ended up dating eventually for a year but I was a pretty shite boyfriend. Only realized my cringe many years later when I was scrolling through old messages for nostalgia. Bad idea. Past me was an idiot."
depression,eyaht6p,t3_cvz4wk,1566963577.0,I stay up late because I don't want to wake up in the morning. I know the vicious cycle feeds into itself but I'm trapped. No escape indeed.
depression,eyahlsv,t3_cwbpre,1566963495.0,I've sent out so many messages the last few years to see how my old friends are doing. Some replies. Some conversations. Usually end in them not responding. Never once have I gotten a message first. Sucks :^/ It has made me not send out so many messages and ultimately stop replying to the very few I had been having decent conversations with.
SuicideWatch,etdso0o,t1_etd7wbu,1562714242.0,Windows PC. I have a 1TB and I have another SSD somewhere too but my power cord is basically filled up and definitely can't afford a modular or bigger one :/

SuicideWatch,et5rn6s,t3_c9umba,1562486225.0,I've been hoping I would die in my sleep or get some kind of disease for a few years now. I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself so it's the next best thing
SuicideWatch,et5rj5k,t1_esp0fue,1562486068.0,I haven't read anything other than writing prompts in years. I do actually miss it. Thanks for the suggestion. I've been meaning to play skyrim too but don't have enough space on my hard drive. I've been trying but it seems to keep coming back.
