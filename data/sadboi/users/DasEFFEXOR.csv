AskDrugNerds,fqj4xs3,t3_gixrvi,1589405100.0,"Generic medications are not recommended for certain medical conditions, such as epilepsy and some hormone replacement therapy, because of lack of satisfactory bio equivalence to the brand-name drug.[3](https://www.mdedge.com/psychiatry/article/63896/depression/how-differences-among-generics-might-affect-your-patients#bib3) For these conditions, generic medications *may* be used, but should not be substituted for the brand-name product without careful monitoring. Additionally, switching between different generic manufacturers should be avoided. 

That alone should tell you that no... they are *not* all the same. 

In general they should contain the same primary ingredient. There are a couple caveats to that though. The original manufacturer doesn't have to share how they made the ingredient.  Generic drug manufacturers must explain to the FDA how they intend to manufacture the medicine and must provide evidence that each step of the manufacturing process will produce the same result each time; inclusive of any other company that is involved (different companies could produce different chemicals needed). Because of this the most common way to test them is to establish the “bioequivalence” of the product. It's much less rigorous on generics than it was for the brand version so the test is usually a small sample size (usually 40 or less people) and on healthy individuals.   


The generic can deviate from the brand product’s profile by a set amount—currently a 90% confidence interval limit of 80% to 125%.[2](https://www.mdedge.com/psychiatry/article/63896/depression/how-differences-among-generics-might-affect-your-patients#bib2) This means that pharmacokinetic parameters such as max concentration (Cmax), time to max concentration (Tmax), mean absorption time, and area under the curve (AUC)—which is a measure of overall drug exposure—are no less than 80% and no more than 125% of the parameters seen with the brand-name product.  A new generic formulation also does not have to be tested against other generic formulations, only against the brand-name drug. Therefore, 2 generic formulations may deviate pharmacokinetically anywhere from 80% to 125%. So one may impact you differently than another.   


So what's all that mean?  Generic Ibuprofen is likely no big deal. Psychiatric, hormone, etc. medications *can* have profound differences in impact. I've had generic Cialis from India and it's utter shit compared to brand name. It's not going to kill me though. I was on Adderall for a while and while I didn't notice the changes in my personality but EVERYONE in my life did. It took me forever to figure out what was going on... which was that I was constantly getting different generics as the pharmacy would get different prices. It was dramatic enough that I just went with old school Dexedrine (primary salt in Adderall anyway) because at the time there was a single generic manufacturer and I couldn't handle the swings that switching would cause."

oooook so... 0mg -> 150mg in a month is \*VERY\* fast titration up in dosage.

Your doctor not responding is unprofessional and dangerous. If you don't hear back soon maybe look for a new doc or look to telehealth (which has been greatly expanded during COVID).

>After reading through this sub, I am hopeful that venlafaxine might provide a foundation I can stand on to deal with my underlying concerns which my depression and anxiety prevent me from effectively dealing with. 

This gives me so much hope for you. That's exactly the way to approach this. If you do not have a therapist I highly recommend finding one. They can be game changers. Many people do not need meds, they need a therapist. For those of us who do needs meds, a therapist is a potent adjunct to medication.   


As for tips... being prepared is #1. Sounds like you have that covered. If you have a good family/social safety net that's helpful (my wife was a saint). You may not want to talk to them, I didn't - I did but I didn't *want* to hehehe, but having them there to support you if you need is a good thing to have. Most onboarding symptoms resolve in a few weeks... put a note in your calendar of the day you started so you can track when you take it. SERIOUSLY, do this... it's so helpful and keeps things in perspective. Also, if you increase in dose do this again... because while not as big a change you still go through the whole process when you increase dose (applies to all meds in this class).   


The main tip with Effexor though: be consistent with your dosing. Most horror stories are effects people feel due to the short half-life of Effexor. So consistent timing of your dose is important. I take mine at 10:15am every day. I started first thing in the morning but eventually shifted to 10:15am in case I wanted to sleep in on a weekend or something.

A few things... your experience can change across dose increases. A lot of times, depressed people don't really get more ""energy"" from their meds but a lessening of depressive symptoms which makes them more apt to... do things. This isn't always the case, as sometimes it causes insomnia because it's to activating for them. Again, this can change at different doses.   


Lethargy can be a side effect (as is the ""energy""). Some people have to take it at night. If you decide to change when you take it you HAVE to do it in incremental shifts. Don't just switch to night if you take it in the morning. It'll fuck with you because of Effexors short half life. I recommend shifting in maybe 1-2 hour increments each week or two until you get to the time you want. I did this myself so that I could shift to taking it at 10:15am; that way if I slept in on the weekend I didn't end up getting brain zaps.   


Get your blood pressure checked. The higher dose you go on Effexor the more it can impact your blood pressure. This is often age dependent but it can certainly happen. You might feel ""racy"" while also feeling fucking exhausted all the time.   


You could pair it with Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin is known to have an activating/energetic effect. Because it's in a completely different class of meds you can take them together (I take Effexor + Wellbutrin myself).

I think many of the extended issues people talk about are doctors not being informed or not informing their patients. For instance, mine told me I could go from 150mg > 0mg in a week. That's just fucking dangerous. When I titrated down I did it in 37.5mg steps every three months. I had no withdrawal in the way people talk about it. I think it's when they do far to quickly that it's most prominent."

It never resolved for me (at 150mg despite months of regular classes) but it's really encouraging to hear that's not the case for everyone. The medication really did change things for the better for me and that was the only real uncommon negative I could tell people.

Effexor,fmids59,t1_fmidirn,1586107577.0,"Effexor is an SNRI. Which is an SSRI that additionally targets norepinephrine. In fact, it targets serotonin at like a 40 to 1 rate so it's primarily a serotonin reuptake inhibitor."

Effexor,fmgcwxi,t3_fuxj55,1586046229.0,"Most doctors, including psychs (actually, mostly psychs), are utterly ignorant of this stuff. Your withdrawal is very real. It can happen with all meds of this class but because of Effexors very short half life it's much more pronounced. 

Go slowly. 37.5mg decreases at a time. I did 3 months per step. I avoided the withdrawal. My doctor said I could go from 150mg to 0mg in one week. Fuck. That. Guy. 

If the last step is difficult you can cross taper from 37.5mg Effexor with the lowest dose Prozac. Effexor == short half life, Prozac == long half life. At the low doses you can take both, transition off Effexor, and then eventually off the Prozac. 

Best of luck. You weren't crazy at all. Be well."
EffexorSuccess,fmbzlyc,t3_ftvj3h,1585936142.0,Full efficacy doesn't kick in until around 10-12 weeks in any given dose.

Congrats!
Effexor,fmbzd3b,t3_fuc7l7,1585936009.0,"It takes ~4 weeks to begin to feel benefits. Full efficacy is not until 10-12 weeks. The first 1-3 weeks are onboarding side effects (what you've described sounds normal). So the short answer is no you shouldn't bounce around meds this fast. Would Prozac be better? I really don't know and that varies by person. 

Also, unless you're in a really bad spot and experienced with these meds I wouldn't jump up higher than 75mg so quickly. When I went to 150mg it took a full 11 weeks. A little Effexor can go a long way and the higher you go the more pronounced some of the side effects are (these meds all have side effects of some type and that varies by person too). The thing to know about Effexor is that it has a short half-life so withdrawal starts quickly. So be sure to take it consistently and ideally at the same time every day. Don't stop quickly either or life will suck. Go than in 37.5mg increments. I'd say a min of two weeks per step. I did a few months per step - and had no major issues stepping down. 

FWIW I had anxiety so bad I just hid under a weighted blanket almost all of the time. 75mg Effexor allowed me to cope and functional again. Best of luck. Be well."

I take Wellbutrin with my Effexor and it works well. As someone else started mirtrazipine is also a good combo. Wellbutrin is a little more activating whereas mirtrazipine is a little more sedating (in general... Everyone reacts differently)."

I take Effexor+Wellbutrin and find it's a good combo. I cannot do any better than the above in describing why. That one takes the cake!

I personally think that Wellbutrin or mirtrazipine should be the first choice to try because of their low side effect profile. They're not as consistently effective for all people though and it really depends on what you're addressing. If you have very high anxiety Wellbutrin alone could make it worse (never did for me but it does for some). But if Effexor managed your anxiety then Wellbutrin could be a solid addition instead of higher and higher doses or maybe Effexor calms you but also sedates you a bit... Wellbutrin could work there as well. 

Chemically, they're doing different things but have some overlap in what the effect. Again, I can't do any better than the other comment. It's pretty spot on."

Effexor,fm29590,t3_fsjp6a,1585692892.0,"Effexor has a very short half-life which is why the withdrawal is so pronounced. You should never miss/stop cold turkey and instead titrate down. At the last step you can cross taper Prozac (very long half-life), stop Effexor, then stop Prozac. Also be aware many of the withdrawal horror stories are people stopping cold turkey or two quickly... Often at their doctors uninformed direction. Mine tried to tell me I could go from 150->0 in a week. Fuck that guy. I went back and told him I wanted to go down in 37.5mg increments every few months. I had no withdrawal. I can't speak to which other meds night be better. They all have withdrawal of one type or another, just like they all have side effects, but Effexors rapid onset of withdrawal is certainly a thing.

Based on that, I wouldn't think it would be out of the question. Hypertension can have long-term negative health consequences though so you should get it checked out. You can buy an at home blood pressure cuff at CVS/Walgreens. They're not as accurate but it lets you check several times a day if you want. I take mine in to the doc with me so that I can calibrate it. They get out of whack after a while so you do it a few with yours and then have the doc do it and then figure out what type of deviation yours might have. If they aren't open to adding another medication they might want to talk to you about switching to a different psych med and away from an SNRI.

Are you in the US/on extended release? I'm usually the guy that makes fun of someone if they buy Tylenol instead of the generic brand. But this stuff isn't acetaminophen. Generics have the same active ingredient but they can have different fillers and different manufacturing processes. Years ago there were so many Adderall manufacturers that I would end up with a different generic every month sometimes and while \*I\* didn't notice much different everyone around me did. The personality changes were drastic enough that multiple friends independently had checked in with my girlfriend to see what was up. It got so bad I just got generic Dexedrine and stopped the Adderall completely because they all impacted me differently. Point being, generics can impact you differently. I think the coating that makes the release ""extended"" is one of the bigger ones as it impacts how quick the on/offset of the medication takes place."

Coropharma was great. Barr was awful (slammed on and stopped just as abruptly). Teva was ok (but dropped off quickly and wasn;t as effective). I believe there was another brand as well (I have it in my notes somewhere). Each one would impact me differently and the pharmacy is constantly renegotiating prices and changing brands. I had to get off it and switched to just regular Dexedrine. Just because it has the same ""main ingredients"" doesn't mean it's made the same way. So for instance on an extended-release, what they use to ""extend"" it could have different onset/off timing and it will impact you differently. It's pretty frustrating.

Effexor has a very short half-life. One of the shortest in this class of meds. That's most often why you hear people with brain zaps and telling horror stories. VERY often that is due to their doctor not knowing what the fuck they are talking about and not instructing their patient properly.   


When I stepped down I did it in 37.5mg steps, 3 months per step. That's a VERY VERY slow taper but that was intentional on my part to avoid the stuff above as well as to be able to watch for a recurrence of symptoms. I had no withdrawal doing it this way. I would do a MINIUM of a few weeks per step. Just my opinion on that one but slowly letting your body re-acclimate to not having the medication is best. Remember it takes 10-12 WEEKS for full efficacy. Just because it's left your system doesn't mean your body has fully adjusted. Giving it time to do so is the smart play.   


My doctor had told me I could go from 150mg -> 0mg in 5 days. *FUCK.THAT.GUY.* That's so reckless. I did it my way. They can always give you a 75mg + 37.5mg then, 75, then 37.5, etc. But do it in the smallest steps and they CAN give you whatever combo you want to make the dose you want.

When you're referencing your swings are they dramatic/quick to change? As in one might be manic and then it switches and you feel dull or depressed? If it is then it's possible to have undiagnosed bipolar. That would just mean there is a far more appropriate class of meds.
