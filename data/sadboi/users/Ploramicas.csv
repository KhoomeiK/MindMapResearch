the trick is to not let it get so long, i probably do it about once a week in the shower.

So you shower first so the follicles are heated up and I apply conditioner lol but coconut oil works well or shaving cream. Afterwards I apply a bit of cerave cream and done!

Regular exfoliating helps with the ingrown hairs (just the top bit - you dont want to get sugar in your woohaa), just regualr olive oil and sugar scrub, leaves it really smooth afterwards,"

Like you im Smart, but maybe its having a brain that is telling me im loser cos i know i deserve better than this. Turning 30 soon which makes me feel pathetic. At least u mánaged several times to get on your own 2 feet and provide for yourself. Ive been living with inlaws for 10yrs, they despise me and i despise them, they are horrible people that treat me like i am worthless. They even turn the light off when im in a room making me feel invisible. Im treated like a piece of shit at work too, so all I do is cry, I hate being at work and i hate being at home, so i just hate being, therefore why am i alive. I broke down on the floor crying when i thought about people diagnosed with cáncer, happy people that love their life, why do they deserve to die when i am here ? Cant i switch with one of them and make their family happy? So im sitting here crying pouring my heart out to you, a stranger, when everyone around me knows im miserable but does nothing to help. And yeah ive tried SO many times to have faith, keep on going, try again, everything will get better, and here I am again feeling like the biggest Joke and loser of all time. I dont know what advice I could give you, but we are both Smart, and one day we wont feel like this, tell your future self that you are trying your best, you are fighting, thats all you can do. You have to be your own best friend in these times where u feel like nobody else understands.

I went for the next best thing, hada laba arbutin whitening moist lotion.

Ive heard good things about microdermabrasion but I prefer to use lactic acid for exfoliation and also calming products meant to heal the skin. Ive even been throwing sudocrem at them recently but I know your frustration, I literally am obsessing over these marks cos my acne is finally under control more or less but im still left with the evidence on my face that I had it bad!"
AsianBeauty,f9npt8t,t3_e51buo,1575488662.0,"no unfortunately, i still get flare ups, sometimes its just a small itchy patch and other times its worse.

The worst ive had recently was 2 years of eczema on the soles of the feet, I was my own worst enemy cos id scratch until bleeding and couldnt walk without seeing stars! I got into a good healing routine and eventually it went away.

sometimes i get an itch but just remembering how bad it was is enough to not give into that itch.

i think eczema has cycles and even if you think youve grown out of it you never know when it can come back and you have to be midfull of the products that you use. Eczema sucks, my mum said I used to scratch myself so badly as a baby she would put gloves on me.

I´m the only one in the family with this...weird"

look for centella asiatica, aloe vera, collagen, glycerin, niacinamide, anything that is brightening - vitamin C or rice extract.

The tip for these marks is that you have to treat them like a wound, cos really it is wounded skin. To fade them the natural way you have to rely on suncream and time.....if you go into the sun without spf then they could ever get darker! yikes!!!

ive got them too.....sooooooooooooooo annoying right?!!!!!!!!!!!"

acne,f8c6y1p,t3_e05df6,1574453872.0,"you might want to wash your back with a simple gel face cleanser instead of body wash, the cosrx morning low ph gel could be helpfull as it has a bit of salicyclic acid in there.

Another option is to find a body lotion with lactic acid in there.

Finally if you think it could be keratosis pilaris then lactic acid + reduce sugar intake.

If its from sweating during exercise make sure to shower after asap and dont be like me, cleansing the house in her zumba kit XDDD"
acne,f8c6l92,t3_e06ee8,1574453640.0,"have u seen a doctor? could be acne rosacea, if you find that it is that then azelaic acid works the best. its also important to make sure that you are using a gentle gel cleanser to wash your face and you are folowing it with hydration, a light cerave lotion could be a good start for a beginner.

Dont go overboard on the moisturiser though it could give you more acne. and of course stay away from coconut oil"
SkincareAddiction,f8c67r7,t1_f8c5ua7,1574453389.0,do u prefer it to adapalene / differin? i went to a derm and she recommended it. I´ve got a second bottle of granactive un-opened but after im done with that I think its time to turn it up.
SkincareAddiction,f8c5jyc,t1_f8bxdar,1574452950.0,thank you! its PIH. Azelaic acid was brilliant for managing the acne but its not really doing much for the marks. Is tretinoin like a hardcore granactive 2%? cos granactive is quite good for an all in one product too
SkincareWithFriends,f8c52wl,t1_f8bw7mk,1574452633.0,"well I do that routine about 3 nights a week and 4 nights a week I do antiage so lots of massaging and using buffet, granactive 2% then the rice overnight sleeping mask by cosrx.

I have map and azelaic alternating in the am and of course a korean spf but these marks arent budging. I´ve been recommended the white ampoule serum from cosrx, im from rice toner and alpha arbutin from the ordinary. 

I love Brandon´s Q&A, there is the one he does with Nadine Baggott on youtube, theres the downloadable pdf where he answers loads of questions and then there is also the question and answer you did a podcast on a while back.

To which I replied ""honey, If I had it my way, my day would only consist of me pampering my face hahaha, and also there is a bit more that goes into it than just washing your face, there are masks, serums, jade rollers etc"" 

She looked at me like I´m from another planet.

Then I asked her, ""why? What do you do to your face?"" - she looked at me confused - ""like, ok so what do you use to wash it?""

Then she replied ""nothing, but if I do I use my shower gel"" ----------- then I made the face in the photo! But THEN, EVERYONE else that was having lunch agreed with her and said they use shower gel too ------- to which I made the face again but even more disgusted!!!!!!

SkincareWithFriends,f7lx32h,t3_dqqu9g,1573849689.0,"Best option is to leave spots alone to avoid marks but if you are like me and its driving you crazy then this is what I did just a few days ago:

I had a huge red pimple on my cheek without a head. I left it for 2 days but it was still just there, red with no head  so I did my double cleanse, I used a few drops of lactic acid all over and then applied a thin layer of some cerave lotion all over. Then I put a pimple patch on (like Nia suggests below) - I use the cosrx ones, and I left it on overnight, I got to sleep in cos it was sunday and when I got up I took the patch off and had a steamy shower.

Then I looked in the mirror and realised that the pimple had a head, all I had to do was press ever so slightly and (how to put this nicely) ---well you know... then I did my routine and put a new patch on to suck up the rest of any bacteria (cos sometimes it does bring more to the surface, I´ve had spots just not want to vacate the face!) and also to heal the spot and reduce the red mark that will be left behind. Not being able to touch your spot or scratch it also helps with the healing.

The next day I´m left with just a slight red tint to the skin where the spot was.

If you are constantly left with scabs it could be that you are pressing to hard on the spot, best to steam before and also the patches will heal the scab so definetly check them out.

&#x200B;

I´ve youve got no patience to wait for the patch to bring the spot to a head you could get a washcloth and with heat do 5 mins off 5 mins on a few times a day and bring it to a head like that, sometimes it works - sometimes it doesnt is my general experience."

acne,f5m6woj,t1_f5c8ajv,1572287158.0,"Aztec Indian Healing Clay in my routine

- mix with apple cider vinegar (mixing with water makes it do fuck all)
I add 2 drops of tea tree oil for a deeper clean.

leave it on till dry or till it turns a lighter shade of shrek! (fiona if you prefer)
then wet a warm washcloth and GENTLY take the mask off, gettin it really wet will help.

do not use metal spoons for mixing or for putting the mask in, plastic or glass only. I use those ice cream spoons that you get at ice cream places.

I try to do this every sunday evening, its normal to be red faced for up til an hour after. I like to use an essence and a hyalauronic serum straight after then a layer of cerave lotion and if i still feel dry a few drops of rosehip oil (the ordinary).

When I was really struggling with acne I do this about twice a week but three times max or it will really dry your skin out.

Lactic acid on your chin three times a week will make them all errupt into pimples a lot quicker so you can just go through pimple hell at one time and then concentrate on the marks instead of a few pimples on the chin constantly for months.

things that helped for me-: spend at least 60 seconds cleansing your skin, ice painfull pimples, put a warm washcloth on the juicy ones and if they want to come out they will do so like this, drain them and then pimple patch them.

another option is lactic acid from the ordinary twice a week or the aztec indian healing clay"

the mandelic dont do more than 3 nights a week....

patch test the niacinamide cos it breaks some people out and other people love it"
SkincareAddiction,f4vy0oo,t3_dm1mle,1571849395.0,"id go with the cerave hydrating lotion - 

the cream (blue bottle) is quite thick so it would be better for the really cold weather.

The lotion is lighter, which could be better for her as she it at an age that she could be getting acne due to hormones etc.

After swimming she should use a gentle gel cleanser like the simple brand and follow up with a little lotion.

The lotion is quite big so you could get a sepearate little cointainer and put it in there so she can take it with her easier.

cosrx is a good option too - i have their morning cleanser and its nice"

Get a warm washcloth and keep heating it, you are trying to bring it to a head, when it has a head warm washcloth again and gently squeeze. after that id clean it with antiseptic, or a gel cleanser then id pop a cosrx pimple patch on it, changing it every 24 hours until it has healed. when you are left with a scab dont pick at it and put vaseline on top to keep it moist.

acne,f4mkrw9,t3_dl3kg1,1571679550.0,"literally copy and pasting advice i gave 5 seconds ago to another girl with similar issues:

 

Topically there are things you can try, what Id say worked the best for me when I was similar is:

\-gel cleanser, take your time to cleanse with warm water and a washcloth - gently

\-azelaic acid 20% chemist

\-aztec indian healing clay mask, every 3 days or so until i clears up, to combat the dryness cerave lotion.

If they are painfull ice your face

I only used to pop the really big ones with pus - i call them Fred (sorry fred´s out there lol) and then id clean it and put a cosrx pimple patch on top - if anything it helps to not be able to pick at them.

this is my best advice from experience and misery- hope it helps!"

Even if it sounds stupid put a meditation for anxiety and stress video on youtube, turn off the lights, lie back get comfy and breatheeeee. Just hearing the voice telling you to breath and that its ok is really calming. It sounds wacky but trust me it really does help calm you down.

\-use heat protectant if you live in a hot country (pissing down outside so can probably skip that one)

I just got the jamaican strong roots hair oil and hair food, worth a try I guess. Some people take biotin . my doctor said its a fad - not too sure on that.

Another thing probably only applies to me - do you scratch your head? I do and its a sort of anxiety thing from stress that I do without realising - I try to realise when im doing it now and occupy my hands, I think my balding is down to mainly this, stress and washing too frequently and Id brush it while wet too.

With the greasy hair thing, supposedly your hair will get used to you washing it less and produce less oil.

Perhaps try washing every 3rd day, if on the second day your hair looks greasy maybe wear a cap in public? If you cant do that work perhaps comb it back and do the ""italian"" look? oh yeah I forgot, massage your scalp too, invert your head so its between your knees and just give yourself a 3 min massage to get the blood flowing, same with exercise too its supposed to promote good circulation.
