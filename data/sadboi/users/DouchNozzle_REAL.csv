I've felt overwhelmed in the past seeing the pass is ending soon and I don't have enough time to collect everything. Stopped spending money on this game because I just dont have the time to grind out for all the cool extra skins and it feels like a waste. Really I wish you could still work towards getting these skins after the season ends. Kinda how in season 6 you could continue getting wolf cosmetics even after the season ended. 


I want to have access to what I've paid for without being burdened by these grindy challenges. But that's not really realistic so I've just stopped playing this game."

The only catch is the team outside has to send robots in to look at what the indoor team is doing to prepare. Because the team indoors spawns first, they take their gun to a window and aim it at the outside team who will spawn about 40 seconds later.
