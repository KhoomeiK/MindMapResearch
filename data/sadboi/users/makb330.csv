PanicAttack,fqw9q2n,t3_gl96cl,1589696997.0,"Don't be embarrassed. I'm in the same boat. I kept getting panic attacks in the shower for some reason. Idk why. It's not like I take hot showers. Especially when I did my hair and closed my eyes. Baby steps exposing yourself to the feelings. Maybe one week, take a bath at the end, turn on the shower and stay under for a 1 minute. Next day, 2 mins..etc. Remember, panic is uncomfortable but not dangerous."

PanicAttack,fjky9bh,t3_fdzr2b,1583436279.0,"If you like them, they shouldn't bother you right? They say to accept them, tell the panic to bring more and actually want to have them to rid them out of your life. They are powered by fear, lose the fear, lose the panjc."

Most of us have went through the same situation. Now, don't be afraid of them. Don't be afraid of the possibility of having another one.

panicdisorder,fi00fzd,t1_fhzy4s9,1582020532.0,"Don't be surprised if it tries to show up again at any time. It likes to do that. Remember what it is and what it isn't. You're now equipped with the knowledge. Accept it, let it do what it wants, tell it to bring it on, continue doing what you're doing. Whether it lasts 5 secs or 5 hours, it doesn't matter. Want to have one. Want to experience another to again prove to yourself how much of a bluff they are. Use it as practice."
panicdisorder,fhzqj4n,t3_f5n9vq,1582007682.0,"That's what happens when you say ""f it"" to the panic! When you don't care if you get a panic attack or not! You literally welcome it to do it's worse and kill you if that's what it's going to do. Panic sucks but it's all a bluff. You will never die...it's harmless! Educate yourself biologically what is going on during a panic attack.  It's your body just protecting itself because your mind is saying there's a danger...when there really isn't.  You wouldn't be scared or weirded out if you got these physical symptoms before someone ran up to fight you. Fight/Flight/Freeze = Adrenaline Dump = Physical Symptoms. What keeps it going is your mind adding 2nd fear and focusing on how uncomfortable the physical symptoms are and how you want it to go away. With panic, it's paradoxical...if you want a panic attack,  it won't come, if you want the symptoms to stop, they'll continue. Accept the panic attack, let it do its worse or whatever it wants no matter how shitty it feels (learn to be comfortable with being uncomfortable), continue doing what you're doing while telling the panic to bring it on! If you do all of that and mean it, panic will maybe last at most, 10 mins."

PanicAttack,fhac8ha,t3_f22mbb,1581404209.0,"U/Minecraftbattallion, same with me! Just have to remember that although uncomfortable as hell, scary and a nuisance....panic attacks aren't dangerous. All just a bluff! Body protecting us from a danger that are mind says exists...but really doesn't.  The more you face and accept all feelings, thoughts 100%, the less they will occur. It's hard don't get me wrong. Gotta go through hell to see the other side of fear is freedom!"

Some are stronger and last longer than others because you add more fear to it. The panic will ALWAYS end! Read up and listen to the info I gave you in the last post. You can nip this now."
