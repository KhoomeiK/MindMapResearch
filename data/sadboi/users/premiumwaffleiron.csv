I found that I was able to comfort him when he needed it, but when it came to comforting me and working through my mental health issues, he couldn’t reciprocate. I found it to be draining since it became a one sided relationship, but he didn’t see it that way.
Save your energy who is willing to help you as much as you are willing to help them."
