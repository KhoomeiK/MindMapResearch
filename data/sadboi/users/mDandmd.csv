My ex went psychotic and I'm very curious about this, how did you go undiagnosed for so long? Even while blacking out?"

And also I've taken the same self diagnosis questionnaires and they've come back with some serious issues, but I've always been told the golden rule ""don't believe everything you read on the internet"" so I've never taken them seriously.

(Came back to this more sober, hope ur up to some good shit, but my reply still stands haha)"

I tend to cater towards others. I make assumptions to what others like in a person and try to become that.

That doesn't work but being myself doesn't either.
