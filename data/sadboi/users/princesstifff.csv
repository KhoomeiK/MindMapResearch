depression,f7ays1w,t3_dv37ic,1573546367.0,"Last week was probably the worst week I’ve had in awhile. Everything was going terribly for me lol I had a breakdown/tantrum while driving & screamed like a maniac twice last week which was something I hadn’t done since maybe 2017 lol I was very close to slamming my car into a wall but hopefully this week will be a little bit better.

I also almost had 3 panic attacks (I was able to prevent them but the physical side effects throw me off) & honestly last week was just absolute shit. My professor also basically dehumanized me & gave me a ton of shit for not having the mental ability or energy to drag my ass to class - she’s also not accepting an assignment I didn’t turn in because I was in the hospital but she excepted someone else’s because they overslept (-:"

depression,f5jwhk7,t3_dntlvy,1572244138.0,"I know multiple amazing and inspirational pastors who died by suicide recently. 

I have suffered depression and anxiety for the longest time, and yes you should ask God for everyday strength but you also need to reach out for help and do not suffer silently because that is the worst thing you can do to yourself.

Yes, it’s still a stigma but in order to break the stigma, I believe we need to talk more about it and inform those who don’t understand.

Mental illness. It’s a huge epidemic."
