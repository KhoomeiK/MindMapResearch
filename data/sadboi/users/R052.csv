Krishnamurti,fneytix,t1_fneqql3,1586898340.0,"If you have to try to be unconditionally loving, isn‚Äôt that itself, conditioned as it is a reaction from the self? For instance, if you try being unconditionally loving for a time, you still aren‚Äôt unconditionally loving; behind the reaction (trying to be unconditional loving) is a mind that does not have this love, which explains why it tries to have it. So Isn‚Äôt unconditional love a state of mind, a natural love that one has as default? Not something that is produced from the self?"
