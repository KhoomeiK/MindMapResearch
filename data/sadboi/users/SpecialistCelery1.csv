AmItheAsshole,ffqbqfh,t3_eulpmr,1580129532.0,Get your daughter her own drum set. My mom was a social worker and if clothes or toys sat around gathering  dust things went to kids who needed it more. Sometimes i was resistant “doesn’t matter if I’m not using it that’s MINE” but eventually I think it made me a more caring and better person with less concern for material things.  So I understand the impulse to give your daughter your son’s drum set but it could go a different way and may resent you. NTA.

If you’re using commercial enzymes (not a home prepared batch) they are usually very concentrated and don’t require much digest time. We get our REs from NEB and I usually only digest for 30 min. I tried digesting for longer (because I was taught at least an hour/ug of DNA but it could help.

I also can imagine people responding differently based on music type which sucks. Wow. That story about being more aware of your surroundings is completely valid. You shouldn’t have to worry even more about your safety because you’re trapped in your own little world.
