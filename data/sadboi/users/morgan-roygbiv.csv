I know I am a man even if I don't look the way some other people expect a man to look. It's not because I am not a man... it's because of their expectations...

One reason I know I am trans is, I know my body does not define my gender. so it would be kind of cruel to myself to be evaluating myself as if I need to be like a cis man.

I do try to look the way I want to look but, I may never ""pass."" If someone thinks that I look like a woman, they are not considering the fact that trans men exist. That is not my fault and I shouldn't have to cater to it."

For their part, the five major chocolate companies – Mars, Mondelez (Cadbury, Oreo), Nestlé, Ferrero, and Hershey – have all agreed to independent monitoring of their supply chains. The goal is to eliminate “the worst forms of child labor” – trafficking and other exploitation – by 2020 at the latest. These projects, though many are still in their infancy, will in theory make monitoring of child labor on cocoa farms more widespread.

Like as if every little thing you do is a sign of an amazing future possible career, as if careers are all that matters. So I don't want to know if she likes or dislikes what I do.

I think as long as you say it nicely without resentment and without making it look like you have been disgusted by him, he has a high chance of taking it well if he is emotionally mature. If you are not sure how he will take it you can try the showering together thing and also put the tooth brush in his mouth and maybe he will realize it is a hint? Idk lol. Another way to drop an even subtler hint is you can tell him YOU are brushing your teeth now, etc and maybe he will realize it is at least considerate to do. Hey, if he is used to making himself look decent only for work, it means time to get ready for work is time for him to brush his teeth and he does not have that anymore. I have had the same kind of habits before and noticed when I did not leave the house I did not brush my teeth as much lol.

But also, let me try to explain why he is acting that way. Something I have learned about lies. It will sound weird given the situation is a deadly situation but it's just the reality of being human...

Drugs can be next to impossible to resist, even for someone you love, especially when they are addictive drugs. And he gave in to it after he said he wouldn't. So it's more like a broken promise than a lie...

But maybe he knew he would want to take the pill anyways. Sometimes people lie, not because they are evil or uncaring, but they know they will be punished for telling the truth. And people are allowed to have their own secrets. Having secrets is as normal and human as having a toothbrush. When you demand the truth from someone, it leads to lying because you are not allowing them to keep a secret from you. So... in an instance where telling the truth is a betrayal of themselves, lying is not a betrayal of you because you can not expect a person to tell you things they do not want to tell you if it would be a betrayal of themselves. You can't expect them to give up all privacy for you..."

Its also possible that she told you the friendship is over to try to force you to play the role she wants you to play.

Her thinking it is your fault is extremely narrow minded.

Its not your fault she doesn't have anything to talk about that doesnt suck the life out of you. Its like she thinks her perspective is the only perspective.

There is no reasoning with someone that selfish because they are always going to rewrite the story to make themselves the good guy. 

I think im autistic too and I have had people try to hurt me by saying ""you dont know how to talk to people."" They said it to hurt me because they were hurt by the true things i said. Things like ""you are teaching racism to a child."" Most of these people knew i was insecure about my social skills. They knew my insecurity and they used it to hurt me. I believe that no matter how I said what I said, they would not like it.

It sounds like his mom is used to getting whatever she wants from him and that is not healthy. If you cant convince him not to, stay away from him for 12 days. You can carry it and be asymptomatic for 12 days."

SexWorkers,flsbuqv,t3_fqq93n,1585438677.0,I have anxiety as well as cptsd and ocd. Last year my mental health reached a new low and i could not work as much and i got evicted. This kind of struggle makes self directed work feel like pushing a car up a hill with the e brake on. But I hate to imagine what it would be like if I DIDNT have control of my schedule.

Coronavirus,flpzcly,t1_flpylzi,1585373462.0,"Well maybe i misinterpreted what you meant by care about other people? I thought you meant caring about their opinions because the context was about you declaring yourself superior, but feel free to clarify or point out specifically what you didnt understand about my comment. What I meant is if you didnt care what people think you wouldnt bother telling people that you think you are better than others.

If you meant you dont have empathy, no need to state the obvious. Not sure what ur point is lol"

antinatalism,flpgk69,t3_fpw8x5,1585358977.0,No way. But people may hold beliefs that justify it for them and they may not be good at logic enough to see through it.
mentalhealth,fl518iy,t3_fmfscq,1584826198.0,"Level of success does not really mean the person is better or worse in general or in any particular domain. Success can be determined by environment, support systems, and many factors so there is no point in comparing since we dont see what everyone has going for them. Imo the fact that some people are considered more successful than others just shows we live in a hierarchical society that separates people into different levels of power and control."
