Fitchburg has a newer high school but it’s a bit out of the way (aka it’s not located in a central-ish area how town’s are supposed to build them). I can’t tell you about the academics though. Leominster has a new section to its high school but the rest is still old. The education is good but if you’re not a motivated student, then you’ll likely fall behind because there’s way too many students per class size.

Neither place is known for great public transport, although both have them available.

There’s definitely some areas of Fitchburg that look like they’ve seen better days, but I do the town is trying to “revitalize” Fitchburg.

I know many of the comments mention Leominster has better shopping, but trust me, don’t move there for the shopping alone. The mall is literally dead. The TJ Max and Marshalls, Target, and Walmart can all be easily reached from Fitchburg.

The sign when you come into Leominster says “Legendary Leominster” trust me when I say the only thing legendary about that place is what a legendary joke it is.

EatingDisorders,flbx8e3,t3_fnnjn3,1585014723.0,"24 and a half. I remember looking at myself months ago and thinking, “when did I get this old without ever being young?” My ED controlled my entire youth. If we want to get overly dramatic, it stole my teens and it’s still present in my 20s. I went through a window of depression in my late teens and earlier 20s. Back when I was 22, going through a depressive episode because of a break up and big changes in my life, I kept thinking the last time I felt genuinely happy: it was the summer before I turned 20 and it was because I had unintentionally lost a ton of weight. But you know what? That was a moment I felt happy, not a period, because what happens after is the obsession and compulsion of wanting to lose more or stay the same.

But you can’t move forward in your life if you stay the same. It’s not easy, and I would be telling you a lie if I told you I had control over my ED. I don’t. It’s always there, but it doesn’t make me happy, not really. I’m sorry you’re still suffering and you wished this was something you’d grow out of. I wish it was just a phase too. Talk to your therapist about it when you feel comfortable. There’s relapses all the time, but getting help can mean you adequately deal with a relapse or at least understand that what you’re going through? It doesn’t have to be forever.

I wish you the best in your journey and hope you feel peace."

EatingDisorders,fjss0jv,t3_feu1e7,1583600036.0,"Firstly I’m sorry you are having this struggle and sorry your parents aren’t supportive. From my own experience and from what I’ve gathered reading interviews and articles online is that parents don’t really see ED that involve weight loss as terrible as what they really are. They probably just think it’s a diet or the dreaded teenage angst phase or you being a picky eater. It’s hard for parents to accept that there’s a serious, life-threatening condition with an ED when the results they see of it are you being thin, which in a society where child obesity is the big thing to worry about messes up their mentality.

Also, older people I’ve noticed don’t really understand the importance of mental health and just don’t get it.

That being said, I think you should continue to see your therapist and if you feel like you’re not making progress, ask them to recommend you to the place you would like to go and have the therapist talk to your parents about why that’s the place you need to be. 

I hope you feel better soon."

When Everything Now came out, I was in pretty bad place and so were my friends so it was kinda just us pretending to be like everything is alright and we can fix our situations. One of the things that was really upsetting me was this situation with a guy where I felt like we really connected and that it was going to lead to something. He had his own stuff going on, and eventually it was clear it wasn’t going to work but I couldn’t let go. I couldn’t fix myself and I wanted to be able to fix him.

Then fast forward to the end of that year (I mean May and the end of an academic year- my senior year of high school), and Women of a Certain Age came on, and it really just hit. Like I had been so unhappy with myself and I was doing better. All these crappy things happen, and you blame yourself. But that’s not always it.

learnmath,fhlipmu,t1_fhjtrht,1581701102.0,This is pretty encouraging! Thanks for the words of encouragement. This will definitely help me when I start getting super frustrated and doubt myself being able to make it into grad school!
Environmental_Careers,fgr5tcb,t3_f024ho,1581038868.0,"When I started school, I was a non-enviro major. I did really good, but I was so disinterested in my major, it just was not worth it for me to keep studying that subject. Once I switched, I was actually interested and not spending $20K/yr just to graduate. I paying tuition for something I really wanted, not something I thought I should have."
geologycareers,fgmiv4c,t3_exg4ew,1580925461.0,"I worked about 14-25 hours a week as an undergrad in retail, but my degree was Earth science and I wouldn’t rank my program as extremely hard and tough, but it definitely required a ton of hard work to get through.

I probably worked around 25-30 hours in the summer and did summer classes as well, though they were mostly online. 

Tbh, if you’re overwhelmed and it’s impacting your studies, and mental health, your part time job isn’t worth and there’s a million other retail or service jobs you can get instead if working is something you want to drink."

Environmental_Careers,fdkj2nf,t3_elm74x,1578504786.0,"I’m not sure where you’re based, but I recall in fall or summer that Dunkin Donuts was searching for a sustainability intern so that makes me believe they probably have a sustainability team.

Dr Pepper-Keurig has a sustainability officer, but I personally don’t support the K cup trend so I couldn’t tell you more about that."
gradadmissions,fclv3kn,t1_fclt5xy,1577757191.0,"My dream would be to pursue research for an environmental/engineering/geology firm or government position. Those are obviously tough, maybe a possibility but something that would take many years to actually achieve.

Realistically what I want is to work with environmental/engineering/geology firm or government position as a geoscientist or environmental scientist to work with things like climate change adaption/mitigation, conservation, or natural hazard prevention/mitigation. Stuff that seems like it should be entry level, is listed as entry level but requires 3-5 years experience and a master’s.

I want a master’s degree for job help, but I also am more interested in continuing and advancing my studies because I care about what I’ve learned.

So unfortunately regarding the GRE, only one program I’ve looked into (I’m only doing MA and New England regional schools) have the GRE waived. Some schools I looked into say they’re GRE waived, but not for all programs so I contact and of course, the program I’m interested in requires it."
