BPD,foun6wb,t3_g9ndhb,1588087096.0,"Remember that you might not live to next month or next year, so whatever things you labeled could just end. In 100 years, we probably won‚Äôt be around. The universe continues anyways. 

Good and bad are two parts of the same whole (alan watts elaborates on this in his books/talks). It can even be a sliding scale, if you‚Äôd like to conceptualize it. 

It is very human to label things, we put everything into categories as human beings, when really the universe doesn‚Äôt care, in all its complexity. It‚Äôs mainly to make sense of things even though they can‚Äôt really be reduced to any one thing. Humans themselves are extremely complex, yet we still attempt to reduce everyone to their appearance, gender, race, etc. Oftentimes, humans are just wrong. We look at the sky and call it blue when really that colour simply comes from reflected light rays on molecules of air in the atmosphere. It changes colour all the time too. 

Just know that things in life are constantly changing, some for ‚Äúbetter‚Äù and some for ‚Äúworse‚Äù, but this is beautiful. Things that are constant are disregarded and taken for granted‚Äî think of breathing and your heart pumping‚Äî that almost never changes, AND IT SUSTAINS LIFE, and do we ever really think about it? Nah. Unlike that, we love drama, we are obsessed with things as fickle and out of our control like romance and emotions. Emotions are emotions because theyre everchanging, never cuz we‚Äôre constantly happy or constantly sad ‚Äî then they‚Äôd just become background noise. This rollercoaster is what we focus on (again Very inspired by alan watts). 

There is still happiness and good people in your life and even though they are not perfect and you might not get exactly what you want from them, you still experienced something with them. And sometimes what matters is the connection you two share. Or even just the fond feelings you feel for them in these moments. 


I‚Äôm often scared to put these types of thoughts out there for fear of hurting people, but those r my two cents"
