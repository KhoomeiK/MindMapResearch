I admit it’s a tight ass fit though so sometimes my husband parks outside. I have a small crystal business that I run online from home so I don’t often have my car outside anymore and when I worked downtown I was always parked in a garage. 

We did live in Capitol Hill for a while and we only had one dedicated parking spot. Poor husband insisted that I take the spot because he felt like I was more of a target than he was and would often have to park blocks away. I know suburban life is boring for some and I would never trade our times living in cap hill or in a Victorian house in 5 points, but there are some details that I don’t miss. Like walking through a spot where drugs are constantly sold just to get to the liquor store. I’m too old for that shit now."

Chriswatts,fgedehl,t1_fgavet9,1580696993.0,I’m talking about the headlights and the headlights only. They come on before this person walks out. They don’t flash. They are On and stay on.

Chriswatts,fgafse5,t1_fg8e71g,1580650757.0,"Who started the fucking truck? Wanna answer that for me? How does he start the truck and then walk outside without walking back in?

Not as smart as they (NK and Chris) think they are. 🙃"
Chriswatts,fgaemx2,t3_exnd89,1580650303.0,Ah I forgot to mention that I also have a comcast security system that I’ve had since 2016. I actually used to work for the advertising side of the company in a research capacity. The camera footage does not time out between the lights coming on and Chris walking out. That and the potential for a remote start are the only answers anyone has ever offered as a reason for the sequence of events in that footage.
Chriswatts,fgady7s,t3_exnd89,1580650172.0,"I’ve been shouting this pretty much everywhere. Don’t fret about pony tail or not. The jeans or the leg shape. First ask yourself how the fuck that truck got started when Chris doesn’t have a fucking remote start. How does ONE person start the truck and THEN walk outside without walking back in first? 

I think what they wanted it to look like was just the truck UNLOCKING, and then a person walking out. However the lights don’t just flash they come ON.  Not one person has been able to find an answer for this that is reasonable. In fact I can’t even get anyone to give an answer for it period anymore, reasonable or not. 

Even Nate says in the footage that he thinks he can see Chris coming from DOWN THE STREET.

There’s a huge reason for all of this. I believe that Chris went out the back by himself and walked around the block or the side of the house so that he could be IN THE TRUCK ahead of time just in case Bette left a min or two early. Then we have all the synchronized swimming act of Bette leaving and Chris backing up, yet somehow there’s an additional set of headlights that no fucking way in hell are they Bette’s.... we see her lights make the turn in her driveway yet there’s another set that somehow go straight forward down the street slightly after Bette leaves. 

He doesn’t have a remote start. Because if it were a stock remote start that is an option for the model of truck he had, it would flash twice...  it wouldn’t just come on. It also would flash if he unlocked it, like it initially seems on the first watch, but that doesn’t happen either. The lights come ON And they stay ON. Chris can’t and wouldn’t purchase a 3rd party remote start for a truck that doesn’t belong to him. When the truck was sold it was not listed as a feature. 

If you click on my profile and look at my posts we discussed this in the thread about chrisnshit’s body language at key moments during the body cam footage at Nate’s house. Specifically when Nate says he can see people make uturns in front of Chris’s house was interesting. Then he goes to text someone IMMEDIATELY. He looks just as sick to himself then as he does when the bodies are coming outside. 

Ask yourself why would he have planned so damn much with the oil well etc (which I believe he had help getting that all started and likely pre dug Shanann’s hole because he didn’t have enough time to drive out there and do everything he said before his coworkers came). 
I’d even be curious to see a map of all of their well sites because I wouldn’t be surprised if that particular site was chosen for a specific reason. 

He took the gas can - for a reason. He called vivant repeatedly for HOURS for a reason. How would he have gotten the Lexus out of the car later in the day without NK? All she has to do is turn her head around and back out and bam it looks like Shanann left. Because it would be too fast to see a moving vehicle and tell. If we have to argue over grainy pony tail images for a walking human - in a car? They would have gotten away with it if it weren’t for Nicole Atkinson. 

Also remember that NK was googling Chris and Shanann long before she even WORKED for anadarko. Like wtf why wasn’t she questioned about that?! 

Last thing I’ll mention. As a local I’ve seen Rourke on television for several cases. The only time I’ve seen him rock back and forth to soothe himself just like chrisnshit does is for the press conference regarding not investigating NK any further because Chris had plead guilty. I’ve seen press conferences and footage of him from several cases in Weld county and not one other time does he do that shit. 

This whole damn case stinks to high hell."

Chriswatts,fetnc6u,t1_fep00d0,1579377156.0,"I have quiet BPD.

My biological father had issues and my parents divorced at 2. I was not allowed any visitation with him, and he passed away when I was 11. 

My mother married a man when I was 5. He actually works for LE in Weld county, and that career has had a profound impact on him and our family. His family is a different ethnicity and never accepted my mother or me. They continued this into my adult age. My uncle on my biological fathers side is the only family remaining besides my grandparents. He took me out for lunch when I was 21, I only saw him one other time besides that. He said seeing we lived in the same town he would be calling to invite my boyfriend later turned husband and I over for family stuff yet refuses to speak to me since then. I am the only other family member that has any claim to the very valuable estate, and am frankly certain this is why he keeps me so far away. 

I do not work now, for the last 2 years due to health issues. I was perfectly fine until I was in a crazy ass car accident and over the years following had several surgeries and found out I had a genetic condition. My mother and step father basically ignored and thought my issues are in my head despite tons and tons of evidence of the opposite. 

Ok so now that I’ve established that... I can also say:

I graduated with all As in both high school and university. I finished my bachelors in 3 years and paid for it myself (I did have about $30k in disbursements from my fathers death but I went to a private university that is incredibly expensive). I worked for the university and later in retail while in school, after 9 months I was a manager for the store i started at. I married my high school sweetheart. I supported us from 2003 - 2006, then later did it again as he would switch careers and education etc. 
I’ve always had very lengthy longevity in all of my jobs. The shortest of which was 3 years. I had the same best friend since junior high until last year when she honestly ghosted me and I later heard that it was because she still hasn’t had any long term relationships and or jobs and it became painful for her to be around my husband and I. We have two very smart and empathetic children. My oldest got an award from his elementary school for once being the most compassionate kid in class and later for being the biggest helper. He still gets remarks about how caring and sweet he is now that he’s in middle school. My daughter is a little more wild but still very similar in that regard. 

I’ve never been arrested or in trouble in any way really. My husband and I have struggled financially but we are way way way better off than the majority of those we graduated with or even coworkers etcetera. If it weren’t for my car accident we would be much better off. I still try to contribute where I can by selling rocks to collectors (but that’s where my similarities with that woman end- our appreciation for rocks). 

I am truly sorry for what has happened to you both I just feel like it’s important to be aware that being terrible or unreliable isn’t a highlight of BPD."

Chriswatts,feti72u,t1_fepknr2,1579375676.0,"Forgive me because I am going to be a broken record on this thread and everywhere else. But I was in a similar perspective until I stumbled on this...

Who started the damn truck and who walked out? He did not have an automatic start on the truck. There was no gap in motion long enough to make the camera time out, so it’s not a situation where like with Shanann - we don’t see her walk inside but we do see Nicole Atkinson drive away... the truck starts and then we see someone walk out. I think the intention was for it to appear as a key fob unlocking the truck. However it’s not a flash like you would traditionally see. Too much time goes by for it to be that. No the truck is ON or the lights are turned into the ON position.
I have a comcast security system and I also worked for the company - I admit on the advertising side of the company, but I’ve asked the tech people about this and I have my own experience with the cameras and system that I’ve had since 2016 and continue to have to this day. It wasn’t a time out. That’s not why we don’t see someone walk back in before coming out. 

Add in the ping in Frederick that morning. Add in the synchronized swimming bullshit of all the lights right between Bette leaving and CW backing in. Add in Chris shitting himself during the coonrod footage when discussing things like u-turns, etc. Then all of the other shady ass behavior around all of this, and I can no longer believe that she wasn’t physically there.

Chriswatts,fetfwdr,t1_feotcy1,1579375076.0,"Malignant BPD. Please don’t forget that the highlight of BPD is abuse and abandonment. Which fuck her family issues just BARELY qualify. So many people experience so much worse and have BPD yet lead totally normal lives with many solid relationships, despite struggling with certain themes as a whole. It’s also one of the only disorders that can truly be treated to the point where the dysfunction no longer exists in a way that is damaging to the person. I just want to be careful with vilifying a population of abused people. Fucking NK obviously feels nothing except for her own desires, while by in large the BPD population feel things much deeper than the average human being. They are usually very emotional and can be extremely empathetic. There is also a very large subset of quiet BPDers that do not lash out but rather isolate themselves instead. NK believes that she is MORE worthy than most. I mean that’s her whole fucking thing is being the upgrade period. While most BPDers have a difficult time believing that they are loveable because of their flaws, she acts like and does anything she can to project that she doesn’t have any. While I do agree that she shows many characteristics I just feel compelled to argue, and will repeatedly do so (sorry guys) that she is a malignant BPD that has gone so far she has lost many of the highlighting characteristics, and that she is closer to a sociopath. I know the bad ones give the worst name and attention to a condition, I just also want to provide awareness so people don’t adopt an attitude of hatred toward people who are essentially victims struggling with their situations."

When he told Jaime that he drugged Shanann with oxy.... by then CW was for sure beyond devaluing Shanann. Shit she was already dead to him in his eyes. 🥺 
::side note:: it will never cease to pain my heart how willing Shanann was to work not give up and to change for Chris and how completely undeserving he was of that effort on her part.

So he told his family all the dirty details to help galvanize his support from them. He would certainly need it regardless of if he were caught or not. I don’t think it’s usually wise for couples to share too many details regarding shit like this to friends and family unless there’s one of two situations: they intend to end the relationship entirely and therefore have no reason to care how their partner is perceived by their family/friends... or maybe as a call for help and advice. But the overall approach and context matters and considering this fucking letter was written when presumably most of this extra detail was shared during this visit... we can’t really provide the benefit of the doubt on the latter scenario of genuinely looking for advice to heal or repair a situation.

Shanann’s parents weren’t aware because she still hadn’t given up hope in Chris and wasn’t willing to completely disclose to her mom and dad *all* of the things that made their relationship and Chris unstable, because she still gave a damn. Unfortunately. 🥺 I think that’s why so many of us are just scarred by this crap. The idea of being so committed and yet being made a fool of, really.

That AHS commercial that played at Nate’s house was a sign from above if I’ve ever seen one in my life. I’m not religious and don’t really partake in the Bible. My MIL is on the surface very puritanical/evangelist yet is the biggest liar and manipulator I’ve ever known in life and uses the book to control, exalt herself and guilt anyone who should dare to go against her. So I admit my perspective has changed and has frankly been forever tainted by my experience.

Chriswatts,fesx94t,t1_feo333x,1579369856.0,"Hey there if you look at my post history I did a background on some of CWs behavior during the officer coonrod footage. However in the threads below we also discussed some things in relation to NK. There are a handful of people I’ve been chatting with including cricket and fiddlesticks regarding some theories I have that I can not publish online. Would you be willing to chat about that with me and perhaps share what you’ve found? I’m just curious if anything lines up with some of the theories we’ve been discussing and am willing to share those details rather than you feeling pressed to share the report to see if there is anything that lines up. 

Edited to add I also have some personal questions to ask as I sometimes legitimately fear that I’m at risk of being in a Shanann like situation with a fucking horrible MIL that I often feel like has it out for me. Plus a husband that in the last YEAR of 18 together has made efforts to not be so damn allowing in this enmeshment situation, yet my overall vulnerability (I’m disabled and not able to work), and the continued attacks from my MIL make it damn near impossible for me to relax anymore. I know I’m way oversharing here but I am genuinely curious what your take might be, and if there is anything I can do or look for specifically in addition to what you’ve shared in your OP to assess these situations."
Chriswatts,fesvw80,t1_feo333x,1579369564.0,"I think it was because they were going to need the money quickly. It was before his world and lies crumbled and he got arrested. Pawning it also in a way again devalues their marriage yet again, and Shanann in general. It also leads to just the overall criminal nature and context of their conversations IMO. No one in their right mind suggests that bullshit if they think a person is just temporarily gone. Pre COURT? Are you fucking kidding me? No she wasn’t fucking investigated because she was never truly pressed about any of this. 

I will trumpet this shit until she is arrested or the world ends for me... who started the truck or who walked out because it can’t be ONE person. Add in the ping and her behavior, shit even her dads behavior and Rourkes as well. Daddy K pushes for the investigation into Chris to be ramped up and I truly believe that he was told, well we can back off your daughter IF CW goes down hard and quick but otherwise she couldn’t be protected... still she was mostly given softballs. 

I think if I were NK I would have been initially thankful for the Heidi Broussard case because for a moment, and around the holidays to boot... the majority of the crime community shifted their focus.

Has to be the upgrade or it’s a no go for her. I highly doubt she has any abuse other than daddy left mommy for another woman and instead of feeling bad for mom she fucking decides well, I’m not safe if I’m not the person that is contrived after one decides what they don’t want in life, and maybe she just needs to be a great helper in assisting some dumb ass in “figuring out” what he doesn’t want.

Just a little FYI before we totally borderline bash and those out there who aren’t even aware of it begin to think of it as a totally all or nothing “for bad people” a la psychopaths and sociopaths. Which I also believe she’s basically falling into one of those two as well, tbh."

I had one uti that lead to 3 kidney infections over the summer. It was the WORST. I was taking doxycycline because I already had a crap ton of it and I didn’t have insurance at the time. So I was kind of trying to doctor Quinn medicine woman my own ass all summer. I found out about Pau D Arco having an antibiotic and antifungal properties and I initially was just doing an intensive round of that combined with the garlic and oregano oil... and it truly was helping, but it was super daunting to swallow so many supplements especially considering I have serious neck issues and am missing a muscle, plus an artificial disc. So even though I was improving it just wasn’t as fast as I needed it to be and I just couldn’t continue to swallow all of that.

I did go to urgent care a couple times to get tested and diflucan after self treating with the antibiotics I had. I was encouraged by the herbs helping but like I said I just needed it to go faster at that point.. I was losing my mind. Anyway the  last time I got a script for some antibiotic called  nitrofurantoin which is specifically for kidneys and urinary tract infections. Some antibiotics just don’t get —-idk —- low enough in the body? Sorry I’m exhausted and can’t form a thought at the moment ha.😕
Anyway, the last round of nitrofurantoin, followed by a round of diflucan (one pill is never enough I always end up needing 2-3), combined with the Pau D Arco which I still take one or two per day. 

I hope that helps and you start to feel better!"
Candida,fcd5n72,t3_egpr1v,1577606658.0,"I was having repeated kidney issues and UTIs. I started taking Pau D Arco (12 caps a day during really bad symptoms) and 1-2 per day when you feel fine. I would also recommend a round of prescription meds too. I know that antibiotics get us here but sometimes that’s still the best course of treatment. You might need a different medication if you’ve already tried prescriptions.

Edited to add: I also took garlic and oregano oil when it was super bad."

So you’re going to hold this baby the entire time at some rando neighbors house. Got it. Granted I had 2 csections, but damn. I can’t imagine making it that long without needing a nap.

And I guess I’m really super fucking lucky that my husband would actually be worried. Would actually do something... other than just take the opportunity to chill and take a nap as a blessing or something and also totally fucking manage to be so damn blazé about the whole thing that he doesn’t even THINK about the other child or really anyone at all for that matter until the school calls to say “ugh is someone coming to pick up this poor kid or what?”

BPD,fb94916,t3_ebwvro,1576628964.0,"Me. I have a chronic injury that is the result of a combination of a genetic illness I was born with, but didn’t know I had until I was rear ended.  The man that hit me was from a country where women aren’t allowed to drive (he was so mad when he hit me that he beat his own truck with a crow bar in front of a whole team of women’s lacrosse players. And! The reason he hit me in the first place was he was pissed that two vehicles in front of me had stopped at a green pedestrian light to allow a woman with a small child and a stroller to pass before it turned red. He laid on his horn. I motioned with my arms to point at what was going on. He’s cussing up a storm. We all start moving along and he rode my ass of course, then at the end of this park that’s next to the road there’s a small turn off and the same vehicle that stopped earlier made a turn. We all slowed but he plowed into me. Cops took forever to arrive but he was still so angry that they held him at the scene so he couldn’t follow me home and gave him the extra distinction of road rage. 


Anyway the car accident was in ‘09. I’ve had two surgeries including an artificial disc in my neck and eventually needed one of my upper ribs removed as well as one of my neck muscles due to scar tissue. 

I worked up until 2 years ago when a combination of health, a seriously abusive boss in a taxing media/advertising industry, my company moving its physical location and consequently tripling my commute time (plus incurring $6k in toll bills during the 9 months I tried to stick it out at the new location and with new shit boss). 

My husband is the only income source and I feel guilty as hell even though it’s not my fault."

TwoXSex,fb7v35u,t3_ebvmaa,1576600053.0,"It’s all about blood flow and circulation for me. That and sometimes going for it when my mind isn’t already totally all over it (but I never force myself if I’m feeling averse).

There is a supplement you can purchase called Steel Libido for Women. It helps with the blood flow aspect a TON. Highly recommend. Also I try to do things that make me feel more happy.... I roller skate which helps with exercise and play. I waist train when I’m getting ready to help with my mid section which feeling better about my body helps with all that too. 

Last but not least... if this becomes a persistent issue look into a hormone therapy doctor. Regular doctors tend to not test as thoroughly. My regular doc said I was within range a year ago but I’ve been feeling a ton of different symptoms that over the years have snowballed into what almost feels like a fucking auto immune disorder. I’m still waiting on my first round of blood tests but the physician I’m seeing and I both are fairly convinced that I have low testosterone. Which is incredibly common it seems and can be rather devastating actually. Anyway not saying that’s what’s going on here but just keep it in the back of your mind if anything pops up later on. 

Also up your vitamin D by like a lot.

Edited to add that I also had a benefit to my libido from quitting birth control but I’ve already had two kids and my husband got the chop (I had two csections so he insisted it was only fair, plus it was cheaper and less overall risk)."
HeidiBroussard,fb2l8bh,t1_fb25nqh,1576453085.0,"I haven’t read all the reply’s thoroughly yet so forgive me if this is a repeat... but I think he said the only things missing were her, the baby and her keys. That her phone and purse were at home. 

So I understand why no call.  But still... if I’m 2 weeks post partum and these are the circumstances... if my husband thought well the only other place she could be is at the neighbors - he would be knocking on said neighbor’s door within idk... maybe 30 mins. I’ve had two babies and I can’t imagine him waiting FOUR FUCKING HOURS to come at least check. Even if we had fought earlier - ESPECIALLY if we had fought earlier. Brand new baby? No fucking way would my H wait that long to come find me, thank God. 

Watch next we’re going to find out he has a side piece too. He already seems pissed about the book fair purchase- says it’s fine but i suspect it’s not considering he later says that she’s helping another person when there’s only $4 left in her account as if it’s something she is actively doing while she’s missing. Maybe he’s trying really hard to not use past tense lol.

Edited- my bad. He does say that her phone was missing as well."
HeidiBroussard,fb2kbrn,t3_eb5llq,1576452618.0,"What time is the kid usually supposed to get home? Why would they wait until 6 pm to call him? Shit I think most schools will call as soon as the child ends up in the office after pick up time, right? Or did they have an arrangement with an after care service or something? So weird....

If I were 2 weeks out from having our baby - and I supposedly left my phone behind... if he thinks I’m at some neighbor’s house, he would be at said persons house probably within 30 mins of getting off work. 

My read on his emotions and words seems to indicate that there was obviously something up with this book fair purchase. I wonder if it set him off. He talks about helping other people when she only has $4 dollars in her account as like a very present and recent thing, not like a past event. Idk it just stood out a bit. 

The only thing I’ll give the guy is that he seems to be mustering some real tears even if they do feel a little like he’s trying to draw them out - and his language at times makes zero sense.. at least there might be some genuine guilt in there if he did it that he’s drawing on in these interviews. Chris Watts didn’t express any of that. 

I did see some moments of duper’s delight when he’s smiling about allllll the things he’s done with his family to help find her or gather information. Saying that no one thus far has said they heard or saw anything suspicious... as if a neighbor would say to his face, yes I heard y’all fighting and walk out with a bunch of bags later or something. Then he says (I’m paraphrasing here) - “It’s getting to be 3 days now, (big smile) so it’s scary ya know?”...another grin. Like wtf dude.

Le sigh. Poor woman. I truly do hope she will be found safe and sound, but I don’t have a good feeling about this. Already too many weird things here...."

It’s completely dark. Truck starts lights come on... it’s running for a minute-ish... maybe 30 seconds. Then we see someone walk out. Without a remote start it’s literally impossible to start the truck and THEN walk outside

 UNLESS he had gone outside (and the camera initially missed it like it had with Shanann - sometimes it doesn’t start until AFTER it has seen a motion).....started the truck, went back inside before coming out for a second time where we finally see “him” in socks.
