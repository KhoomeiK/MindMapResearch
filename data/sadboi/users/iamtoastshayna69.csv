But no point on dwelling on someone who couldn't even say bye."
polyamory,fbzyqun,t3_ef9lv6,1577269054.0,"Fuck yeah they do! One of my two did so, quite unexpectedly and abruptly last night. Still very much reeling... Funny thing is that out of the two, that's the one I thought would actually last. Ugh."
BPD,fbzv9df,t3_ef8vei,1577263418.0,I need one too please
UnsentLetters,fbzv6ra,t3_efdqah,1577263306.0,"Much needed! Thank you! My ldr bf of almost 2 years quite abruptly ghosted and I suppose cowardly broke up with me (I mean how can you have a relationship if you can't contact someone!?!?) today. He said he was moving here Sunday and I had been waiting for him. 

So I really needed this!"
BPD,fbzuxw7,t1_fbzu2uq,1577262916.0,"Yeah... I need to just take the ""L"" here. Funny enough, I know I'm a beautiful person with a great personality... There's plenty of other people who want me! However, I need to definitely take some time to heal. This guy fucked me up mentally more than any other person ever has. I did the one thing I never do. I trusted him. He wasn't a terrible person, was never mean... Was just never there, especially when I needed him most. Learned my lesson though. Just wish it didn't hurt so damn much."
BPD,fbzqzmi,t1_fbzqj4j,1577257114.0,"Thank you, it means a lot. I'm just kinda blindsided. Like it wasn't expected at all. Saturday he's telling me he wants this and he's not ghosting me, that he's leaving bright and early sunday morning to move here across the country, and just generally being the sweetheart he always was. Then nothing from him for nearly 3 days. Then... just blocked... on everything..."
AskReddit,fbbnzbf,t3_eccwli,1576704385.0,Love her. Show her that she's valid and important. Teach her that sex does not equal love. Teach her how to feel emotions without letting them drown her. Not let her be in foster care. Be there when someone breaks her hear and cheer her on when she does something amazing. Tell her that she's beautiful. Tell her every day that she's loved and that I'm proud of her.
raisedbynarcissists,fb2p0o2,t1_fb2n32s,1576455049.0,"I definitely do. I have recently been diagnosed with BPD. Been working hard at dealing with it. Currently in a really bad mental place. My LDR bf was supposed to move here in September. Things keep coming up and he hasn't yet. In October, the emotional neglectful parent unexpectedly died. I've not been able to properly cope yet."
BPD,fb2h6xt,t1_farl64e,1576450977.0,Thank you. I'm fairly sure I've found a new level in hell through this job. Place hits nearly every one of my PTSD triggers almost daily.
AskWomen,fb2gvwi,t1_fb2gnlt,1576450819.0,"I'm trying. Waiting for a few crucial life changes to finally happen, either in a few days or a month, hoping for the former. Kinda in an emotional limbo/hell right now and it sucks."
AskWomen,fb2g9kr,t1_fb2f4j4,1576450495.0,"I have borderline personality disorder. I was making really good progress. I started the job in May and it has helped not only destroy any progress I've made, but also make my disorder worse than its been in a long time."
BPDmemes,fb2bg3i,t3_eb360j,1576448064.0,Yes... Yes it is...
raisedbynarcissists,fb29xka,t3_eb2dvm,1576447459.0,"For me, it was never the violence that hurt. It was withholding love and affection. So every time someone gets upset, I immediately prepare myself to lose that person."
AskReddit,fb25rc5,t1_fb24t77,1576445819.0,"Absolutely not. I've never gotten along with other women, but always got along great with guys. Now I understand why. I hate feeling like I'm unable to be myself because im expected to be in control, always on top of things. I must always bite my tongue, keep my emotions to myself. Must be strong, because no one else will be. Always."
