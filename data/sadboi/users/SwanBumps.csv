And at the end of the day I respect his opinion no matter what it is, but I don't think I was able to understand the harshness that he has towards this album beyond the ""I didn't like it"". it's just a very vague review that concentrated on a con (influences) and just dove into subjectivity. I just didn't get proper perspective."

Paramore,fo8ssqq,t1_fo50d6g,1587603095.0,"personal experience: when I saw the video that Jon had put out on the roll out I got pissed because his opinion was just not well researched. so I didn't even finish because the things is, I get YouTubers reacting to music and whatnots but it's gotten to a point where it just got too pretentious. it's like the YouTubers who give scientific advice on vaccines and are in NO position to do so given they don't have the years of medical knowledge or experience.  and I get it's not the same thing but I mean, it can be disrespectful to someone who has earned years of insights to just claim you know better. I mean they didn't even wait for the album to drop to form half a proper opinion and no it's not just Jon... I don't think she was specifically calling out anybody. 
anyways... everyone is free to give their opinion but that includes criticizing the legitimacy of that opinion."

Paramore's writing dynamic has shifted quite much and I think they're slowly needing this ""leadership"" a lot less. Only my opinion."
