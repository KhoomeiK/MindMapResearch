AsianBeauty,fnfzwdv,t1_fnfwiwp,1586919095.0,"Not at all, they came in a box of 8 from Amazon. Looks like there’s a few different sellers that have some in stock currently."
AsianBeauty,fnfm77j,t1_fnfacjc,1586910831.0,Literally just received my mega box of those same Beauty Diary ones yesterday. Honestly the best! Plus the backing on there is great and I don’t struggle as much trying to lay them on my face.
piercing,fn8ui77,t3_g09bs7,1586750579.0,"I had this issue too, it worried me the same way! Had my seconds done in August last year, they really weren’t fully healed (at least for me, everyone’s different) until December-January to where I had no pain and felt comfortable changing the jewelry. It’s definitely normal to still experience irritation, just treat it gently with some saline spray and leave it be the best you can!"
AskWomen,fm0kc43,t3_fsa805,1585660069.0,"I’ve used my work-issued Swiss Army backpack forever, which was great and held a lot, but I wanted something dressier. I bought the Kaya backpack from Calpak to fit my laptop and some other essentials. They’re very sleek and professional looking, plus great for travel. Can’t wait to take mine back out again once quarantine’s over!"
Hair,fkbkync,t3_fhiu1s,1584034918.0,"This is beautiful! Getting my hair done for the summer and have naturally a darker honey blonde color, definitely using this as a reference for my stylist!"
SkincareAddiction,fk64s5f,t3_fgmzmg,1583893694.0,"Good on you for putting this together, sounds like you’re making progress! I personally love the Restore serum, I’ve gone through countless bottles of it (from Urban Outfitters or TJMaxx, if they have it). It’s refreshingly light and absorbs well, and it’s done well with my oily and acne prone skin, so hoping you can reap the same benefits! Hope your days get better and your skin feels the difference with the new products 😊"
Hair,fjj3wvs,t3_fdowhb,1583382666.0,What a great look! And your eyelashes are stunning as well! What mascara do you use?
piercing,fghmizy,t3_ey0o7j,1580788234.0,"They look great! Hopefully getting my third lobes done this week, seeing this just makes me want to get it done more! Are those earrings threadless?"
PaleMUA,fgcb2zz,t3_expfgk,1580670935.0,My favorite is the L’Oréal Paris Colour Riche lipliner in Au Naturale. It’s a pretty neutral liner that can go with anything. A slightly more pink one I’ve been using is the Buxom liner in Dolly Danger.
piercing,fg86ttl,t3_ex6ekz,1580611062.0,"Looks great! Been wanting to get my third lobes done for a bit, and seeing yours just makes me want to do it more!"
NordicSkinCare,ff1hd7c,t3_er32h7,1579479245.0,"I like using the Cosyrx pimple patches for acne spots, and to help alleviate picking. They’re hydrocolloid bandages that can help pull gunk to the surface without drying your skin out. They’re available through Amazon, or they sell other brands at the drugstore. Bonus is that since the spot is covered, even if you keep touching it (though try not to), bacteria from your hands is far less likely to be an issue. I wear them at night so they can work their magic while I sleep!"
femalehairadvice,f86ietn,t3_dz9ojc,1574298982.0,"You may be able to try a hair, skin & nails supplement. I tried Hairfluence and it worked pretty well, but there’s a ton you can search through on Amazon."
piercing,f7jo79s,t3_dw3mfs,1573782308.0,"I had the same thing happen on one of my lobes. No worries, it’ll go away in a few days as long as you don’t mess with it."
femalehairadvice,f62721l,t3_dqba1l,1572654348.0,"I’ve had the same thing happen, I just avoided straightening my hair for a bit because I found that doing that highlighted my layers in a less than flattering look. I often used a curling iron or wand to make it more messy/beachy. Rather than a full curl, it’s more about making a kink in the hair and not curling the bottom. Or an easy fix was to wear it half up/half down with a clip, and some good hairspray."
poshmark,f4oewke,t1_f4oe1tp,1571700606.0,"I’ve tried, some are just priced so high that I didn’t think they’d sell. Maybe I’ll try filtering for items that have already sold. Thanks!"
poshmark,f25pcry,t3_dc385f,1569980344.0,"Can’t even understand why she would think that’s “dingy,” it’s in perfect condition! Don’t let it get to you - you’re clearly a fantastic seller. All of those 5 star reviews certainly speak to it! 😃"

CompulsiveSkinPicking,ezeynw8,t3_d0wxt8,1567870542.0,"Ugh, I feel you in this, it’s the worst. Currently broke out all over my upper back, just trying to wait it out until it goes away. I use unscented body wash since fragrance makes it angrier. Trying to hold back from picking too, we can do this!"
dpdr,ezc42aw,t3_d0qgv1,1567829569.0,"When I had started therapy a while back, the “not feeling real” zombie-like state I was in was pretty bad. I’d be driving and going day to day feeling super weird and trying to snap myself out of it. But I hadn’t started taking the medication until some time after that. Since it’s been a while since I started taking it, I honestly haven’t had as many time passage issues or the zombie like state. It still happens from time to time, but I definitely have a better grip on it. I didn’t have as much memory issues to begin with, so I can’t honestly give you a useful opinion there. Glad I’ve found someone else taking this medication too with DPDR issues though! Helps take out the fear a bit knowing you’re not alone."
dpdr,ezc27kx,t3_d0qgv1,1567828782.0,"I’ve taken 5-10mg Brintellix (although I believe the name was recently changed to Trintellix) for about a year, year and a half now. I actually take it at night to help with the nausea so I don’t feel it as much during the day. Nausea was only worse for around the first 3-5 days of starting it. I also suffer from DPDR and generalized anxiety disorder, and while it didn’t necessarily “cure” anything in my case, I’ve found that it has really helped alleviate both over time so they’re much more diminished than they were before I started taking it. I think that with all of the changes you’re going to implement, this prescription will be beneficial to you and you’ll likely start to see some changes in a few weeks. Good luck to you in your journey! DPDR and anxiety are tough, but it seems like you’ve got a pretty good plan laid out for yourself."
MakeupAddiction,ey77w4j,t3_cvxfxr,1566874292.0,What a stunning look! Well done!

Anxiety,erwm3bh,t1_erwjhoq,1561347840.0,"Don’t beat yourself up, you’ll know when you’re ready to go. There’s so much out there and so many opportunities that exist, if you’re ready to start fresh then absolutely do it. But this is something you’re going to have to hold yourself accountable for if you want to make a change. Good luck out there, there’ll be a silver lining for you!"
SkincareAddiction,erwjhz3,t3_c4giij,1561345504.0,I use hydrocolloid bandages for stubborn pimples to keep me from touching them. They’re acne patches that stick to the skin and help pull oil and nastiness out. I buy mine from Amazon!
Anxiety,erwj10u,t3_c4gz92,1561345090.0,"I’m feeling the same way right now. I work in accounting and have been at my job full time for six months and am studying for the CPA. I feel sick to my stomach on my drives in to work every morning and panic all the time. I’m telling myself to hold out until the end of the year. But I’m just not happy - and it sounds like you aren’t either. Don’t feel like you’re a failure if you don’t end up in the type of field you thought you would, most people don’t. I had this grandiose picture of what my life would look like thanks to my perfectionism/anxiety, and it’s just not that way. Don’t be afraid to make a short term plan for the future until you can mentally get back on your feet. We’re not on this earth long enough to be miserable 24/7, so maybe you just need a change and some time to look deeper into yourself because ultimately, your happiness is what matters."

Anxietyhelp,eok7tyc,t3_brzr7r,1558648536.0,"When I start to feel the panic set, I’ll rub my sternum and take some deep breaths. I take moments for myself to just kind of “shut down” mentally and restart. Definitely helps at work when I get to feeling distressed."
Anxiety,eok73xk,t3_bs0v7q,1558648132.0,"Thanks for this, I definitely needed to see it! I’m studying for the CPA exam now and started working full time after graduating college. It’s been really rough and I’ve been in a bad place mentally."
