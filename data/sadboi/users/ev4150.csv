nba,fj3bnve,t1_fj28bbc,1582977334.0,He just didn’t wanna keep adding more fuel to the fire. He fucked up and he knows it. Smart guy actually.
nba,femiqqg,t1_feks0s2,1579257656.0,This draft sucks. No one wants crappy picks outside of the top 10

49ers,f1b0nvw,t1_f15zwel,1569317972.0,"We all did but he hasn’t played in literally years. He needs more first team reps and he’ll most likely get them, he’ll get another chance since Whitherspoon is going to be out 3-4 games."
49ers,f1b0iil,t3_d7y7xa,1569317719.0,"We are 3-0 which is amazing and I’ve never seen it done since I’ve been a fan. I was born in 95. The way I’m looking it at is we could go 7-6 from here on out and still make the playoffs at 10-6. Obviously, I hope we do better but there’s a lot of season left and this team as a different feel about it."
