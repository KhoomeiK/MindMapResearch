socialskills,fpqde6h,t1_fpnyrhu,1588820297.0,I relate to this.  Best times I’ve had with friends was when we are jokingly roasting each other.
Anxiety,fodi95q,t3_g6u4dj,1587685018.0,No they’re not.  I sprained my forearms about a week ago sadly lol.  Although the chest pains are definitely annoying and makes me think I have COVID from time to time 😕.
MensLib,fkceilx,t3_fhenc3,1584051404.0," I’m against politics being pushed in commercials and TV shows, but this isn’t even that bad.  This definitely doesn’t warrant the hate that it’s getting and I think the only reason it’s getting so much hate is because Brie Larson is in it telling a woman to not compromise on her job 🤦🏻‍♂️"
unpopularopinion,fgv47x9,t3_f0grkb,1581136667.0,I don’t take the people who blame us for our ancestors transgressions seriously.  I won’t take responsibility for something I wasn’t alive for and I think the majority of people both white and non-white agree with that.  It’s this minority of people with these crazy ideologies that the media and college campuses push that drives that bullshit.
CruciblePlaybook,ffsdxtn,t3_eusvm4,1580179382.0,"Nightshade is an underrated pulse rifle I think.  I’ve never seen anyone else use it, but when I use it I always have my best games.  I don’t even play crucible that much, but I think the gun carries me lol."
UnpopularFacts,ffscl9d,t1_ffs6hig,1580178493.0,Kobe is the exception to the rule in that case.  The majority of the time just the association with  rape is enough to destroy a mans life.
dating_advice,feuknrh,t1_feug4pa,1579387428.0,Well you can continue to believe you will be at the bottom of the barrel.  I’m in a shitty place but I refuse to believe that.  Especially when others have succeeded in similar circumstances that I can learn from.  That’s the reason I made this post.
dating_advice,feujz9d,t1_feu1b3v,1579387244.0,"Yeah I’m done with online dating for the foreseeable future.  It’s been difficult to meet people in person though.  Only friends I have are from work and usually aren’t open to hanging out and I got the meet up app on my phone, but there’s none that have shown up in my city.  It’s a struggle."
dating_advice,feujd8d,t1_feu47jo,1579387073.0,I’ll definitely give that book a read.  I do think I started using my height as more of an excuse.  I’ve had woman be attracted to me before but I just was never able to push it further either because I wasn’t confident or I didn’t read the signs correctly.  I’ve just become frustrated with it.
dating_advice,feufi1p,t1_feud8op,1579385997.0,"I’m not sure how much I believe that.  I don’t  expect the most attractive woman , but I’ve seen guys who are of short height able to get at least average looking woman.  It’s more of trying to find out what those guys did and applying it."
anxietymemes,f95owkh,t3_e3p5fm,1575132433.0,When you have that moment of clarity and you realize how irrational and ridiculous your anxiety really is 🤔😪.
Rateme,eymo5ex,t3_cxjjq4,1567214825.0,8/10 for sure.
Rateme,ex7t0mw,t3_crkwz0,1566064453.0,9/10 for sure.
Anxietyhelp,er3jw6h,t1_er31asg,1560464910.0,Part of the problem I think is that you are afraid to have panic attacks.  I understand this as I’ve also had panic attacks and felt completely vulnerable and out of control because of them.  I’ve learned that just accepting the possibility of it happening and seeing it as non threatening was what helped me.  Because although it is scary to have panic attacks they don’t really do any physical harm.  Not saying this will work for you just sharing what has helped me.

Anxiety,eoozd6x,t1_eoocgv8,1558751273.0,Definitely I never read anything from this sub because it is rarely anything that actually helps.
Rateme,eoo5xc6,t1_eokooor,1558730184.0,Yeah a shitty hairline and the military doesn’t mix well.  Thanks for the input.
memes,eonf2xg,t1_eonek1g,1558710939.0,Worst nazi ever.
unpopularopinion,eoedlyu,t1_eodc3qz,1558493848.0,Unpopular but definitely is true over the last few years.
