What i do is while I'm laying down and I've found the sleeping position I like, I focus my mind on a body part. Usually I start with my toes and work my way up my body. I imagine that body part as made of sand. I imagine it becoming heavier and heavier, relaxing each individual muscle, and then i imagine that sand crumbling and drifting away in the wind. I do this for each individual body part. Some body parts are more stubborn and take longer to become relaxed, but that's OK. I just do it until my entire body is ready for sleep."

Now things are even worse because of covid and all that.
