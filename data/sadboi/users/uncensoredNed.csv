TrueOffMyChest,fq6w7zo,t3_gh0tmi,1589138637.0,"I seconded the comment about news aiming for ratings. But as even another comment pointed out it wasn't just white people killing a black man. it was a murder on video by someone related to the DA that didn't go anywhere until it got attention. The people involved killed a man because of they skewed views and then nothing was done because of possible connections to the the people who should do something about it.

Next you are challenging a perception with limited cases. You perceive that black mass shooters aren't getting enough attention, but your evidence is just that black mass shootings happen. A more proper analysis is along the lines of: crime statistic say X% of ""mass shootings"" are committed by black individuals with information from a cited source. Then you would have to show what % (Y) of ""mass shootings"" by black people are covered by the news or ""widely"" discussed. Defining what widely and discussed mean in this context. Then we can start to really look at why the X differs from Y noticeably. 

This is a big problem because people are really really bad at telling frequency of things occurring intuitively. Are you watching national news channels and sites daily or are you reading about these things once it hits reddit. If its because of reddit you might find that this site is picking cases that show issues they personally want addressed."
ADHD,f8l3us9,t3_e0yqfq,1574618133.0,"I honestly can't help but cry, not in a bad way all the time. Reading stuff here reminds me of all the struggles i had before learning i had ADHD. I didn't learn about it until 6 months ago and im almost 30! The struggles are less now at least since getting on meds and learning tactics to work around the issues."
AskMen,f8fw7k8,t3_e0m323,1574550278.0,"I wasn't a good boyfriend. I didn't do the things i should have or showed her how much i appreciated her. I got lazy and over time her love for me faded.

Looking back part of it was me dealing with mental illness that i wasn't addressing (depression) and that i wasn't aware i had (ADHD). But an equal part was not knowing how to be better and not trying. I would like to blame the ADHD and depression but just because they made it harder doesn't excuse the lack of effort on my side.

I still miss her and knowing why it ended is always driving me to not have it repeat by being that person again, even though fixing myself takes a long time. Not being a better partner to her is my only regret in life."

They have built an identity around this, plus because of spaces like Reddit they are part of a community because of it. If they decided they were no longer an Incel they would lose that community and social identity. 

It happens in a lot of groups, especially some of the mental illness groups on reddit. The people hold being depressed as who they are, not an illness they suffer from, so at some level improving is also losing part of their self."
ADHD,f5o7d1i,t1_f5n12jn,1572311587.0,"i would be careful with that line of thought. a lot of people assume that the day or two after stopping is their baseline, but most stimulants are going to have a ""rebound"" or ""withdrawal"" period where you are worse than baseline.

I know the last few years have been rough with the changes and self improvement. But i know you will be the best version of yourself you have ever been in a year. Right now we are dealing with a lot of emotions and choices but i know you will have made it through it.

I hope we have stuck to our goals this year and they didn't end up a rough outline like last years.

I believe in you

TrueOffMyChest,f2501mh,t3_dbwd9d,1569963351.0,"Ok you need to do everything you can to stop the negative self talk. You wouldn't talk to a friend that way and you shouldn't talk to yourself that way. I can say its not the easiest thing but your overall state of mind is not being helped by it. its not a magic bullet that fixes problems, but it many cases it can be a strong first step to breaking out of the state of mind."
TrueOffMyChest,f24z2rq,t3_dbyhdi,1569962883.0,"There really isn't a good sub that i know of on Reddit for support. They either are so structured that someone who really needs the help could struggle to get things into a coherent train of thought to share. Or they are too small and most the people are the ones seeking help, but unable to help others.

I'm confused by your statement that your Alexithymia makes texting a setup to fail, mostly because i had to look up what it is.

I think a therapist is good not because they will solve a problem or give you some thing but because it sounds like all of these things are ""building up"" inside you and come boiling out. Having a person who will sit there and listen while you just talk can help because just saying the things out loud to another person can help you work through your thoughts a little."
AskMen,f0wyn3j,t1_f0wwv88,1569016765.0,"I feel like maybe. But i just fear driving them away like every time i start to relax around people. If i try to express my unhappiness i do it too much and start telling people too much about that and that burns people out and pushes them away. I think i annoy people when i let my normal personality through sometimes. I feel so childish in the way i express interests and hobbies. Also i think im overbearing and have poor conversation skills unless i really focus on how i am expressing things and talking.

Rationally i know most of this is in my head. But I still fear being alone. And these things have worn out my sense of self worth at the same time. heck i made this reddit account because i am afraid my friends may know my other one and because i kind of do what i do in real life and separate expressing these feelings from my other interactions"
AskMen,f0ww7j5,t1_f0woi8z,1569015267.0,It ends up being very draining. But also i don't want to be alone without friends. stuck between a rock and a hard place.

AskMen,f0wll3i,t3_d6z81s,1569009540.0,"The years since high school i became more social and outgoing. Back then i was honest, not tactless, and i was very open about myself. Over the almost a decade since then i have become less honest and more closed off while still pretending i am open.

I've gotten hurt by losing friends because i said or acted weird and awkward that recently i think more about what i should say and what the person would rather hear than be myself. I feel like i prefer being controlling while never actually acting that way, because i always make sure i don't say or do things that would negatively impact those around me."

SuicideWatch,ey4v4pg,t3_cvhewu,1566809753.0,"When the meds cause issues it should be discussed with the psychologist who prescribed them so they can't try something else. Also as the other commenter said you need to see a therapist to work with. if it was entirely chemical the meds might work, but there we go through more things than just chemistry issues that lead to depression or amplify it.

I realize its a little ironic i post this. but its the truth. Also while reddit isn't always the best source of good people to talk to, there are tons of people here who you can talk to about it. plus even talking to someone else about it, with them contributing very little, can help you restructure the thoughts to see if there is a cause or solution you may not had seen while letting them echo in your head."
