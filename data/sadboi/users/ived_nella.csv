AmItheAsshole,fpt10n2,t3_gf4knq,1588882998.0,"NTA but it sounds like your parents have already decided. This is going to be a big change for all of your lives. You said you were willing to give up half of your room as long as they put a wall up for privacy, and the wall had even been discussed previously. That was very reasonable and mature. I would press the issue. Calmly ask to have an open conversation about how this will affect EVERYONE, not about how 'good' or 'nice' it would be for anyone, but what and how things will change. At an appropriate time suggest the wall again, remind them that her night terrors would disrupt your sleep which would in turn affect your health. I'm sure it would be good for both her and you to have a place to be alone when emotions become overwhelming. *Both of you* will need a safe space. I seriously doubt that she wants to move into someone else's room anyway. Seeing as your parents are being terribly inconsiderate towards you and awfully considerate to her you may need to frame it in a way that says ""X, Y, and Z would be good for Jess (and you too) and could make her feel more at home."" And *""Instead of moving into someone else's space she would be given a space of her own.""* It would make the transition easier and more comfortable for everyone. I hope things turn out well for you and I'm sorry your parents are invalidating and dismissive of your feelings. 



~~~ Other Thoughts~~~



I also agree with other commenters and think family and individual therapy is a very good idea. 


You shouldn't have been punished for the incident at the mall. You tried to help Jess but she ran off. You aren't an adult and you are not responsible for another person's behavior. You aren't prepared to handle that kind of situation either. Again, YOU TRIED TO HELP!! I'm sorry you're going through this. Good luck!"

AmItheAsshole,fp64xwr,t3_gbc3zd,1588346150.0,"NTA. I'm going to echo what others have said. Ruby needs an ultimatum. She has to do some sort of counseling/therapy or she can't stay with you. I also think she is desperately in need of some kindness and understanding, not saying that you've been unkind but that it's difficult to fully understand where she's coming from and why she's acting out unless you've been there and it's very hard to be sympathetic when you're on the receiving end of such cruelty. She probably needs a therapist who specializes in trauma and possibly personality disorders. You also need to remind her that ALL of you are family and you and the children aren't going anywhere. She can choose whether or not she wants to be a part of your family but its all or nothing (unless your wife chooses to see her separately). Tell her you understand that she is angry and hurting but that gives her no right to be cruel to her family and especially not the children. 


If she refuses therapy ask her to humor you for 3-5 appointments and you can reevaluate then. If she still refuses you MUST stand by your word and get her out of your house within a reasonable amount of time. I doubt she experienced much, if any, consistency or consideration as a child. She probably used this kind of behavior to get the attention she needed with her father. It may have been the only thing that worked then, but she doesn't need to act this way anymore. She needs to grow out of it now or its possible she never will. 


I'm not saying that if she refuses therapy that you should cut her off completely but make it crystal clear that if she is to live in your home she has to at least try therapy and she absolutely cannot continue the harmful behavior towards her siblings. 


Expect her to act like a teenager but give her the opportunity to act like an adult."

raisedbynarcissists,fog1yvu,t1_foepz5g,1587746717.0,"This happened to me too, It must have been about 3rd or 4th grade. Christmas morning I came downstairs to the living room and was happily pointing out which presents were from Santa and my mom just snapped and said Santa isn't real. I got so upset and I don't remember if I went back to my room or what but she was really annoyed with me and I *think* my dad had to comfort me but I don't remember. We did do presents later on but its something I'm often reminded of. I sort of knew Santa wasn't really real and was just pretend but I wanted to keep pretending and it really hurt me and I didn't understand why she was angry since I didn't know what I had done wrong.


There are other things that I remember but I think I blocked out a lot of stuff. One thing was my mom telling me I was an awful singer when I was singing along with my kim possible soundtrack and I couldn't hear my voice because I was wearing headphones. I think this is one reason why I'm usually too nervous to sing in front of people. My dad once pulled me off of my bed by my ankle and during the struggle broke my bedside table. I had been huddled up in the corner of my room where my bed was, I guess because I was scared that he was angry but I don't remember anything else. All of that happened in elementary school when my parents were still together, there was chaos during the separation period and plenty more afterwards. 


I definitely don't have stories as bad as a lot of people on here and I'm still trying to figure it out but I guess I do have some low-key trauma. I used to think i had a pretty good early childhood but I'm learning that it wasn't as normal as I thought.

I can't advise you on life but hopefully I can help with your parents.

 Your parents are parentifying you. They're still your parents and you haven't figured out where your life is going yet. You're still their kid and it really is still inappropriate for them to put this weight on you. Next time they bring it up say something, or bring it up yourself. Suggest that they talk to somebody else about it, say it outright or be subtle. If you've already done that, then you need to tell them that you're not able to handle their problems right now.  Be blunt with them. They are your parents and their love is unconditional. It may be uncomfortable but you have to stand up for yourself. You have to take care of yourself. Your mental health is an important part of your life, especially in this stage of your life.

Ps: Your mom should probably see a therapist. Good luck!"

When I was a teenager the 4"" method gave me a negative cup size. Just remember that each cup size is really just a name for a ratio. Each letter adds another inch. If you have any noticeable amount of boob you're  unlikely to be an A. You sound like you at least have  something noticeable since you say you need a bra so its definitely worth a shot. You'll probably do better in an unlined bra than a padded or moulded type, they don't show under your shirts as much if you tend to have problems with gaping, I know I do sometimes. Gaping is also usually a sign of your cup size being too small. It probably took me 6 or more tries to get my size and shape right, just be patient and keep trying and you'll figure it out.

I actually used to see a therapist at Triangle family services when I was in middle school and I've tried better help(I think that's what you're talking about?) Somewhat recently.  I'm looking for a group though because I need to put myself around real people in real life because that's what I'm  really struggling with along with trying to figure out what to do with my life."

I get your point but there's plenty of things we humans wear that are fairly impractical.  Large bell sleeves, ultra puffy sleeves, stilettos, backless  sweaters, low rise pants, super short mini dresses when it's cold af... hopefully you get the idea.  We wear weird stuff cause it's fun or makes us feel good, even if it's somewhat inconvenient."
femalefashionadvice,fcaaf9e,t1_fc9owru,1577565609.0,I've got a holster style waist bag that I wear under my cloak. And if I wear the right clothes under it it's pretty comfortable in mild winter weather.

I've got two flat pairs, classic boots I got in Germany in 2016, and a pair of double strapped Mary Jane's. I've personally had both pairs break in pretty fast, like maybe 2-3 weeks fast, but I'm terrible with time so take that with a grain of salt."

LifeAdvice,fbmzrq7,t3_ebts1a,1576990855.0,"No. Just no. Nothing is worth ending your life. You don't need to beat yourself up over an academic mishap. This is not going to be as bad as it feels. 

I think it would be good for you to speak with a loved one or a professional who can help you. There's lots of  resources out there. I know it sounds cheesy but it really does get better.  It might get worse again but it can still get better too. I'm 25, not much older than you, and I've been around that track several times. Don't be afraid to ask those around you for help."
LifeAdvice,fblin63,t3_edtd61,1576963465.0,"Every person deserves to be happy and to have feelings whether they're good or bad. That's it, end of discussion.(unless they're like a serial killer or something horrible,  but even that's debatable.)



I think he should probably see a therapist and maybe take up a hobby or just do something that he enjoys/is good at. He's legitimately disabled so he's not expected to take on this role that he isn't able to fill. He can support his family in other ways, just by doing whatever is necessary and possible. I'm not sure of what he is able to do so I'm hesitant to make suggestions on that, but maybe stuff like taking care of the baby so you can focus on your school work, doing chores, picking up groceries and other necessities if he's able to, just whatever might be helpful. He needs to do something that will build up his confidence.



Maybe he should ask himself if he would have his kid, or anyone else for that matter, feel this way if they were in the same situation.  I'd bet the answer is no."
LifeAdvice,fbjykd4,t3_edoh90,1576942074.0,"If it will make you happy then do it. I made a bat-like cloak, no symbols but still very different from the norm, and I've worn it to class. Sure I got a couple of odd looks but I also got a lot more compliments, especially after telling them I made it. I've also seen people in full on lolita and people in cosplay, I always thought they  seemed quite interesting and even sort of admirable for their bravery/confidence.


Embrace your uniqueness and just do it. 



Also, like another commenter said, if somebody recognizes it they probably watch the show too. 
You could also just leave the logos off or make them  removable if you're really worried that much."
FrugalFemaleFashion,fbjs42q,t3_ebye1g,1576939106.0,"I never had any other aeo/aerie products until these but I recently bought a couple of the chill high waist and one regular waist and I looooove them.  I'm 5'5"" 123lbs, I got a regular length small and the legs are exactly the right length for me, so no ankle bunching. The high waisted ones of course come up to my natural waist and the regular waisted ones come just over my hip bone. The waistband hasn't rolled down on me yet and I don't feel like it will. They're not really a heavy/thick winter legging but for everyday use they're good. They've been a great under layer, even for skinny jeans that I've gotta wiggle into. I have a butttt and I don't have any problems with opacity, although I only have dark colors. I also have been walking my dog in them most days and they've never hadany issues. They feel a bit tight when I first put them on (either when new or freshly washed and especially when I've just put lotion on) but after that they're totally fine and I don't have trouble getting them on afterwards. I do have to pull them up a couple times a day but no more than any other pants and not during walks so they haven't caused me any inconvenience.  I bought more after I got my first couple of pairs and I've nearly exclusively been wearing them all month."

Anxiety,f9vm7kn,t3_e75q31,1575673905.0,"100% normal. Although, it would be a good idea to talk to a therapist or your guidance counselor at school, especially since you have anxiety and I'm guessing a bit of depression. It would be good for you to process this whether it's talking it out with a professional or a friend, journaling, art , or whatever you choose.

 

I want to remind you that a counselor /therapist can NOT reveal anything you say without your permission, unless you're going to hurt yourself or others."
raisedbynarcissists,f825day,t3_dyms6n,1574184326.0,"I would say it's definitely possible that she is, but as you know we can't give anyone a fair diagnosis over the internet. Your mom reminds me a lot of my grandmother whom I believe is a covert narc.(Kati Morton has a good YT video on this) I sort of think this type is less aware of what they're doing to people since they're not outright abusive. I think when it comes down to it they actually do want good things for their loved ones but they have absolutely no idea how to handle it effectively. I know first-hand how frustrating it is to have a parental-type wanting to build up your life, often for their own benefit. My grandmother is very much a ""What will I tell people?"" type of person, the superficiality is incredibly frustrating and annoying.



Assuming you don't want to go NC, it would probably be helpful for you to learn about gaslighting and how to grey rock and all that stuff I won't be good at explaining. This way you'll be able to protect yourself mentally and emotionally and still have a relationship with her."
aspergirls,f6tf2d3,t3_dpno4f,1573147987.0,"First, you probably need bigger shoes. And I'd suggest looking at athletic socks, the kind that's a little bit fuzzy on the inside. 


Second, omg this is my life!(insert eye roll here) I used to turn my socks inside out in elementary school, I think in middle School sometimes too. And then wearing Converse all the time just made it worse. I don't have this problem anymore since I get to pick my own socks now, but I feel this so much. I obsessed over socks for a while, mostly long socks, and now I have a whole collection of thigh highs that are so freaking comfy! I basically live in them. I think the seam is an issue partly because of the material the sock is made of and how different it is from the rest of the sock. Also, fuck those toe blisters! They're awful. 


Anyways, I really seriously recommend Sock Dreams if you want nice socks. They take measurements that actually make sense for socks! I nearly exclusively wear their socks but I also have some black athletic socks I got from Amazon (search bolter), I'm pretty sure they're men's but they work for me and I wear a size 8 US. I never think about the seams on them. Also, I think sometimes socks need a little breaking in.

Good luck!"

loseit,f1rb4gw,t1_f1ngsn8,1569713415.0,"I'm sorry about your friend. I get that feeling fine doesn't always mean you are fine, but sometimes it does. I never said ""listen to your body"" I said I'm comfortable. I was trying to convey that I'm not experiencing any negative effects so far. I don't feel faint or dizzy. I haven't had any of those weird low blood sugar brainless moments. I'm not throwing up bile from not eating. I haven't almost blacked out from standing up too quickly. Those are the main symptoms that I experience that tell me I NEED to eat something whether I want to or not. I pay attention to those.



I'm tired of forcing myself to eat when I don't feel hungry. I wanted to know why I should or if I should, because that's what I had been doing. I realized I had lost a lot of weight and then I had suddenly stopped losing weight but I still want to lose a bit more so I stopped forcing myself to eat so much and I started counting because nothing changed. Turns out, now that I'm not emotionally hungry I don't really want to eat much at all most of the time.



As for the vitamins, I'm not sure you have enough information to say they ""don't do much"" I've done genetic testing and blood work and I worked with my doctor to pick vitamins of the specific types that I can absorb properly. This has been a big part of the significant improvement I've experienced lately."
