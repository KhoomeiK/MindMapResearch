It is telling them that their problems are not important, that their feelings are not important. Saying 'hey, your problems are stupid, just go outside and be nice to someone, it's really easy' is honestly the most ridiculous thing I've heard all day.

As soon as I took a sip, I knew straight away the milk was off and it was absolutely disgusting, I instantly felt sick but he asked if it was good and I nodded, not wanting to be rude, and took another foul sip. I obviously didn't think ahead, and realise that my cousin would taste the same milk momentarily, and as soon as he did he spat it out an loudly exclaimed the milk was off.
