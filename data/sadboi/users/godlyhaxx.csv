Also because people love saying Man up or something along those lines


And Males are much more likely to do violent things, as Females are more emotional and generally more intelligent, us males are stronger and more prone to violence. Making males kill themselves more often and more violent than females will. Very hard topic to talk about made harder"

depression,ff9vxjq,t3_esg6ls,1579722680.0,"Damn, I'm sorry. Maybe just.. Leave a note for your husband, telling him your situation or just print this out and give it to him. You dont always need words to give someone and idea. If your too scared to be there when we finds it, leave the house. And if you have any friends or family, give your kids to them while you try and set your Foundation straight. Go to your therapist and see if you can get back on medication or if there are any ways to help. If not i know a few tricks for Deppresion.

1. Keep out of your head, focus on work, your kids, hell your carpet. Just dont sit down and think. Basicslly, clean your house, put on some Good rock n' roll music (avoid deppresing music or music that will throw you into a bad moment of your life. Go to your friends and play video games depending on who you are

2. Make yourself smile no matter how much it hurts, just try and smile. Smile to your kids, your husband, everyone you see

3. Respect what you have and dont have. Its okay to get mad to a point where you could hit your kids, aslong as you dont do it. If you feel like you are getting to that point irl, just calm down tell them you love them and movr on with life

I dont have any tips for the anxiety, sorry."

depression,ff9u1c4,t3_esgad8,1579721290.0,"I'd talk to your therapist about grtting off 2 of the meds, 3 of them might be breaking each other amd making things worse. Also talk to your friends about this, explain your situation and if they dont care, you know where one of your thorns are, just remove it from your life and move on. And its okay to depend on others for happiness whrn you csnt supply yourself. All the matters is that you keep pushing forward as cliche it sounds. Friends are there to depend on, vent to, and guide.. Just make sure you have the right people."
