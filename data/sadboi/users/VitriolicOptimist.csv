LSD,fqtw6tb,t3_gktwir,1589647290.0,"Sometimes missions into the endless void bring nothing but misery. But every once in a while, a traveler returns victorious, returning home with something we knew was there. A glimmer of hope. A simple piece of profound understanding to help us through this madness. So many people live oblivious, in denial, completely consumed by delusional perspective. Some people succumb to despair. The Truth about life is that we are here, forced to exist in an ever expanding tapestry and barred from ever knowing why. There is no tangible ""answer"". No objective truth. Some days I think we are cursed. Some days I feel lucky. The alternative is non existence. Sometimes I feel like that that endless nothing is a black stain on life, but in fact it is the only comfort to be had. You will never know WHY, you will eventually be gone. You have only one choice if you are going to live as a consciousness that has soared this high. You've decided that death and delusion are incompatible for you, and so you must completely accept that you ARE Simply because you are. All I am is a watcher. A universal constant. But I refuse to be cursed. I am free because I have accepted that I am separate from my emotions, my body, my ego. I am a watcher... And that is fine. No good, no bad. things are what they are. Peace be with you traveler. Welcome home and thank you."

The developers take great importance in interacting with their community and making us feel like a big family. They know that they don't have to stoop to pandering and shady tactics to get ahead. Corporate empires try to suck the art out of small businesses and people who care about what they're making. It will never work.

I'm lucky I didn't start doing drugs till I was 22, but I recommend marijuana, psilocybin and LSD to everyone willing to try it. Just don't let life ruin your hopes and dreams.
