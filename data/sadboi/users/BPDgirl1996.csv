BPD,fisxbja,t3_f9j3vc,1582696175.0,I tried doing things like that but I found that the pain of getting piercings would set off a weird anxiety response in me.
BPD,fisx4zy,t1_fisr729,1582696007.0,"I don't have a child but I do understand that feeling. I looked back at my old posts and I felt the exact same way this time last year. I was unemployed at this time last year too which I think has hurt my ability to go out. It's a real problem for me.
I was getting out more when a friend of mine lived close to me and she would pick me up and take me down to the shops. It was really amazing. I felt like I was slowly becoming myself again. But she moved away and got a boyfriend all in the space of like a week so that whole thing has fallen through and now I am back to agoraphobia and social isolation.

I hate being like this. It's so much easier if you have a friend who can drive to you and take you somewhere but people like that are rare. I miss that friend so much already and it's only been about a month. I wish she still lived close by."
BPD,fiswxuu,t1_fisrows,1582695830.0,"I'm really poor and have always been really poor. I don't have anyone who can teach me to drive either. I was doing driving lessons for a little while but I wasn't good enough yet for the test. I had to stop that for financial reasons.

I can't afford a car so it seems pointless to get a license."
BPD,fiswuyl,t1_fisrpny,1582695760.0,"I hope this isn't rude of me, but your therapist sounds like a fucking idiot. Your method sounds great tbh. I am amazed honestly that your therapist didn't like it since it seems more logical to start with smaller achievable goals before moving on to big goals. If you can't leave the house, going and applying for jobs while leaving the house seems pretty big for a goal.

I am glad you got better with the agoraphobia. It gives me hope that I too will improve."
BPD,fiswppu,t1_fissnbe,1582695631.0,"I am glad you get it. I always feel kinda paranoid talking to people like they won't get what I mean.
I think I beat myself up a lot but talking to other people like me just makes me feel better because I stop beating myself up so much. I will call myself a failure and get so mad at myself for not being able to just kick myself up the butt and go do whatever the thing is that I can't do.

So many people don't get it. They are like ""just go outside bruh lol"" ""Just eat lol"" ""Just stop throwing up after eating lol"" ""Stop cutting yourself"" as if it's that simple. I wish it was. I wish it was just a matter of will power."
BPD,fisp4gq,t1_fisour3,1582689650.0,I wondered if it was because I have to walk everywhere that made me feel so hesitant. I guess maybe it isn't. I don't like being looked at really. I think I just feel almost scared of people looking at me.
BPD,fisp0tx,t1_fisop5x,1582689579.0,"Yeah I think for me it's just that I will get ready, I will shower, I will put on makeup even, I will delay leaving, pack my back, put my shoes on, ""I should have lunch before I go"". etc. etc. Then eventually I just make some dumb excuse not to go out because once I run out of excuses to delay it the fear sets in. Or I convince myself I'm too tired."
BPD,fisoxmr,t1_fisoo10,1582689517.0,"I am so sorry you experience it too. I think I don't realise how isolated I am until I am around other people. It makes me feel better to know I'm not just a fuckup since a lot of other people seem to have this problem too.

I often feel like I'm just a loser or broken so I do really appreciate knowing others are also going through this. Makes me more forgiving and compassionate to myself.

I hope you understand what I am saying, I don't mean to call you those things. I just mean I call me those things a lot and it is harder to do that when speaking to people like me and empathising with them. i.e, I empathise with others more than myself."
BPD,fisoqs3,t3_f9ch7m,1582689385.0,Yeah I think it's part of my anxiety. I also was diagnosed with autism so I don't know what it is.
BPD,f6shfgl,t3_dspuar,1573134126.0,"People do this????  
What the fuck?  


Smh. The worst."
