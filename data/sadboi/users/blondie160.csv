More often than not we need to share spaces with people ( homes, work environment, public transportation, etc.) and if somebody is doing something in that shared space that‚Äôs harming (either psychically or mentally) those around them, then why would it be wrong to tell them to stop acting in that harmful way?

Fencesitter,fnk4sc6,t1_fngu6gx,1587014960.0,"I‚Äôm not saying everyone that is good looking is over compensating or faking it, but some of them definitely are. Also like I said in my first post, I‚Äôm mostly referring to stuff that I remember went down in high school. I purposely brought that up because I was saying I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs happening with adults because the few people I spend time with aren‚Äôt like that, but it‚Äôs certainly going on with teenagers. 

There have always been people who would barely acknowledge those who they deem below them in terms of attractiveness, but with social media it‚Äôs like 10x worse. Some people will definitely judge you and treat you differently based on the number of followers you have. If you look up scandals with the major ‚Äúsocial media influencers‚Äù rn you will see tons of stories of them doing shady stuff to gain followers, it‚Äôs like that‚Äôs all that matters. Just look at the fact that the Kardashian/ Jenner family are so famous and for what? what are they good at ? They‚Äôre good at being good looking and causing online drama. 

And yes I agree wanting to achieve a certain type of look for yourself isn‚Äôt bad at all, everyone is entitled to do what they want with their own body. But it turns bad when you shame others for things like not wearing certain brand names, or like in my case how I got shamed for having my natural skin and nails. I feel like that types of shaming is happening more and more. Or yes like you said, spending out of your means or wearing certain things just for followers, which for sure happens too."

But of course there is a line and you can take it too far. I find being in nature, especially early in the morning helps. Also taking hot showers"
Fencesitter,fngdenr,t1_fngaq3j,1586928871.0,"Oh no no, you‚Äôve misunderstood me. In fact I think we are essentially saying the same thing. I totally agree that there are some people who act more extreme just to get likes online. That is one example of what I mean , whatever is trendy atm due to social media makes people all want to act the same way. Even their vernacular is similar because they want to be #trending. It‚Äôs so weird. 

What I meant by personality is just a sense of individuality and staying true to yourself. I‚Äôve witness so many people talk trash (sometimes for YEARS) about others yet they are Facebook friends ?and leave compliments on each other‚Äôs profile pictures? A recent example would be this girl my brother and I both know that got pregnant young (19) and just gave birth this week. Months ago my brother laughed at her for getting knocked up young but this week he commented on her post ‚ÄúCongrats, she could not be in better hands‚Äù. I understand he‚Äôs just being nice so I didn‚Äôt argue with him but I was angry because clearly he doesn‚Äôt believe that statement since he was just laughing at her for being too young/ unfit ( in his opinion) to be a mom not that long ago. He could‚Äôve said ‚ÄúCongrats, she is beautiful‚Äù or ‚ÄúCongrats, wishing you the best‚Äù or some shit, like why did he have to say a lie? People don‚Äôt act on social media they way they act in real life. Like you said, some people push things to the extreme to get the most thrilling looking photos but that isn‚Äôt even who they truly are inside. Pretty girls will actively form fake friendships with other pretty girls just to get photogenic Instagram posts. I‚Äôve been with groups of people having a laid back night but as soon as someone pulls out Snapchat they act like they‚Äôre having the time of their lives. Or how about the really sad fact that younger and younger girls are feeling enormous pressure to wear perfect makeup, nails done, and hair styled most of the time. Girls have made fun of me for embracing my pale skin and having natural nails. Like what? That‚Äôs what I mean when people need to get more in touch with their true selves"

I just shrugged it off as best I could by telling myself I guess I‚Äôm a little different than most my age and eventually they‚Äôll get over the media hype and develop individualism as we age , but honestly even now at 24 I feel I‚Äôm not seeing that much of a change?

Would you mind explaining more how my 10th house planets squaring my ascendent contributes to my social anxiety? I‚Äôm a bit new to astrology so still learning. Also could you expand on the troubles with my Venus ? Sorry if I‚Äôm asking too much, honestly it‚Äôs just that I‚Äôm so confused with the way I usually show love. It‚Äôs always been so much easier for me to be forgiving and generous towards acquaintances or even strangers than close ones. It‚Äôs a trait of mine that really bothers me. I‚Äôve always felt that I love humanity from a distance lol like I don‚Äôt really like being connected to others that much but I would think nothing of giving the shirt off my back to a homeless man. Why is this? I know part of the reason is because growing up , especially in high school, I felt that I cared much much more about my friends than they cared about me. In a way I kinda feel like I have more of an ability to care about others than most and I hate it because obviously that comes with attachment  issues. 

And about the career stuff, well actually I hate anything related to finance or math in general haha. But money is a constant worry for me, even when I‚Äôm doing ok. I think that‚Äôs the main things that holds me back from deciding a career path. Tbh I‚Äôve been seriously considering going into stripping and I could see myself doing that for a few years lol. It‚Äôs appealing to me because I know I need a certain level of freedom in whatever work I do and to me that seems like the most freeing way to make bank so than I can feel secure enough to pursue something more spiritually fulfilling. I don‚Äôt exactly know what those spiritually fulfilling pursuits would be but I know in my lifetime I want to help kids, I have a huge soft spot for troubled youths in particular so I see myself becoming a special education art teacher/ art therapist or social worker. Even if I don‚Äôt work with kids, my long shot dream is to adopt 5 siblings from the foster care system. It just breaks my heart that so many older children never get out of the system and also that many get separated from their siblings. I grew up with a big family so I want a big one of my own but I don‚Äôt have any desire to go through pregnancy or care for young infants. That‚Äôs why I would love if I could adopt a siblings group with at least 2 of them being on the older side and the youngest a toddler (like I said though this is a long shot goal because I would need to feel REALLY financially secure before I do something like that )

I‚Äôm also passionate about veganism! Cooking vegan food is something that is so relaxing to me and always feels good to do. I love serving it to others to help expand their minds on what good healthy food can be :)"

Existentialism,fl114c9,t1_fl00ai8,1584719936.0,"Fully agree with ‚Äúlaziness isn‚Äôt happiness‚Äù. I was listening to Jordan Peterson yesterday and he was saying that he believes humans are, to an extent, beasts of burden. And we can make that burden bearable by firstly choosing the type of struggle we deal with (again, to an extent ) and then fully committing to the responsibility of it. 

People always say cliche things like happiness is earned, and you gotta have the lows to appreciate the highs, etc. but honestly do those phrases really ever stick with anyone lol? The way Jordan worded this was  interesting to me though, I‚Äôve never really heard it put that way"
shameless,fl0rjj5,t3_fltlr3,1584714150.0,"Idk, maybe I need to do a rewatch but I think from the beginning there were always a few jokes about his stupidity. The writers definitely leaned more into it in the later seasons though. I guess they thought it would be a good crutch as the others characters stories slowed down? Lol"
MrRobot,fkzdd43,t1_fkz1rn7,1584668375.0,"Don‚Äôt ever feel bad for being who you are. Society will always tell you to be one way or another but the only thing that really matters is to make sure whatever action you want to do doesn‚Äôt hurt others. If it‚Äôs not, than just go right ahead and do what makes you happy. No need to feel guilty or like a freak. I think there are a lot more homebodies out there than you would guess, we just stay so low key that it seems it a lot more abnormal than it actually is lol. 

And just to clarify so I don‚Äôt look like a hypocrite rn, in my first comment I wasn‚Äôt saying I lie because I‚Äôm ashamed of who I am. I meant that I make up excuses for my more extraverted friends who often can‚Äôt seem to accept the concept that staying home alone is highly enjoyable lol"
MrRobot,fkxpmjy,t1_fkxlp2m,1584632970.0,I‚Äôm honestly loving this because usually I need to make up some excuse as to why I can‚Äôt go out but now I don‚Äôt have to lol
MrRobot,fkxpfga,t3_fla4ob,1584632863.0,This edit makes her look 50+ lol wtf ??
confessions,fkwbwyd,t1_fkvclks,1584588345.0,"Agreed 100%. OP I think your best bet is to just keep focusing on the future you can have once your old enough to leave your family behind (and when I say that I don‚Äôt mean I think you have to break off contact with them forever, that is your choice, but it‚Äôs clear that you need to be in a healthier and more loving environment.) If there is anyway you could live with other family members or close friends than go for that. If that‚Äôs not an option than focus on the fact that you will be driving in just a few short years. That will give you a whole new sense of freedom, even if you still have to come back to that stressful house to sleep. Spend these years saving up for a car. I know a lot of places won‚Äôt hire until 16 but I did a lot of babysitting at 14 and also worked under the table at a local pizzeria, you could try to do the same. Food joints will probably be your best bet to get hired off the books. You could also try walking dogs, helping elder neighbors with tasks etc. 
I promise life will feel so much better once you gain that freedom from driving. You said you get good grades, use that to your benefit and focus on trying to get a college scholarship to gain even more freedom once your 18. A military career is another option, but I wouldn‚Äôt exactly recommend that over college. Track/cross country are also somewhat easy and cheap sports to get involved in that may lead to a scholarship route, or in the very least look good on your college application. Try to just do as much as you can in highschool to build up a good resume. You gave up too many years taking care of others who should have been taking care of you. So don‚Äôt feel any guilt over using the next 4 years to truly focus on being your best self and creating a future that you want. 

I wish I had more to say to help your family become happier but honestly there is so much going on that it is out of your hands. It sounds like what they really need is professional help with qualified therapists and a caretaker. But you can‚Äôt make them get help if they don‚Äôt accept that they need it, so I‚Äôm sorry to say but I think the healthiest thing for you to do is to break free from them. At this age you can focus on getting out of that house by spending time in libraries reading or drawing, and also at friends houses. Then at driving age you will have a lot more possibilities. And hopefully college will allow you to be free as you can. You have a difficult road but always remember that what humans are best at is adapting and overcoming. We are really able to adapt to almost anything, so never doubt the power you have within you to change your life and thrive."
