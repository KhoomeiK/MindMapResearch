regina,fnhj1rk,t1_fng28or,1586963322.0,"Honestly it cant be easier! If you need a hand, YouTube or reach out to me. Connecting the doorbell has two wires. Thats it! All the best!"
regina,fng1nli,t1_fnfykhj,1586920230.0,"Hey - I have a Nest Doorbell cam from BestBuy. Couldnt be easier to hook up. I had two seperate incidents- both thefts - that I turned the footage to RPS and both dirtbags were arrested. But yes, keep areas very well lit. The brighter the better."
DeadBedrooms,fe3blod,t3_eik2zf,1578847809.0,"Married three, together 8ish. Moved out over the Christmas holidays and I feel fucking fantastic. My son and I are far happier, and things are coming together. There is light in all that darkness. I think back over the years dreading life because of my shit marriage and dead bedroom. Also, I recently found out she had been fucking a coworker. It just solidifies my decision. As much as it sucks, keep your head up. It will all work out. Peace, brothers. A dead bedroom isn't worth it!!!!"

secretsanta,fbvbgnh,t3_edj3ic,1577128383.0,"Well, another dud. This is #4 for me, and the second time I've been skunked by my Santa. This year killed it for me. My giftee in the UK received his gift but hasn't posted or anything, and my Santa pulled my info on Dec 03 and has been radio silence since. Was optimistic despite being burnt, but no more for this guy."
secretsanta,fbqz25m,t3_edj3ic,1577037197.0,This is my 4th secret santa and the second time getting burnt. They opened my info on the 3rd and its been radio silence since. Dang.

regina,f085d33,t3_d45cyd,1568475488.0,"Graham Tire hands down is the best. Super fast, and by far best prices in the city. I used to use Costco but switched. Be sure to balance and rotate as Hyundai advises. I had a Tuscon and the dealership here fucked it up and all four tires were destroyed. They claimed zero responsibility."
