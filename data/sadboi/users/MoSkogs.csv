I'm only 17 so i guess i haven't lived much life at all but i really don't want to start entertaining the idea of this ever getting any worse then how i am now.

Struggled with depression most of my life (or from what they called 'negative thoughts' when i was 10) and the this quarantine has only amplified my knowledge of how i literally don't have anyone who knows me or cares to try and reach out, which is on me just being closed off. My family thinks i'm better now becuase i dont show any of those signs i used to but none of the struggle went away, i just got a lot better at hiding it from everyone so no one else in my life has to worry. All i have is music and art and my destructive brain, thats how its always been. I was already failing my course but this quarantine has only dropped my grades even further becuase i found it difficult enough when i was at college every day let alone when i have to somehow push myself to do work i barely managed to complete when i did have other people badgering me unlike now, when im just alone.

I see so many posts other how everyones glad to have a break, and i'm happy for them. I believe that this quarantine either greatly helps people or ruins them. People who needed a break are healing, but people like me who depended on just keeping moving and distracting themselves from their mind are just worse off then before. I just feel like i've taken 10 steps backwards in my mental state.

I feel awful for ranting, becuase so many people here have it so much worse then me and i truly feel for them, but i struggle to keep control of my mind nowadays, spewing this sad brain monolouge helps me breathe a little better for a moment.

Im sure i'm no different to everyone else for saying this but I miss working, i miss college. I miss not having to listen to my brain, becuase over the last month or so i've finally had to acknowledge that I really dont like myself or what i've made of what should've been a fun part of my life"

Its the wish to have never existed in the first place, right? never been concious, never made any decision or impact on anyone elses life.

I think many people who suffer with mental illness in general go through similar thoughts, i know i do, its the idea that you wouldn't want to make such an impact with something like suicide but if you were offered the chance to completely delete your life from everyones memory and just disappear you'd take it without questioning it.

I've always fantisized about running away, becuase its the closest to that a person can get really, but then ultimately the fact is you will never be able to escape your mind, no matter how far you run. So you have to learn to handle and heal in whatever ways possible, and accept that you'll most lightly never be completely in the clear, but it will get easier, people have an amazing way of remaining resilient.

To be honest, i've never really found a way to handle it, i guess the only advice i can give is to know that you wont ever be given an opportunity as easy as to just disappear, thats just the truth, if the fear of upsetting your family is all thats keeping you alive like it is in my situation, please consider getting therapy/a doctors insight, and if that isn't available for whatever reason, the only thing thats truly helped me is distracting myself when i get those thoughts with hobbies, just keep moving forward, make art, take up a sport; just anything that makes you feel like you're improving youre being in som eway, thats the only thing that really prevails when your mind is telling you these things.

I'm not saying there isn't amazing celebrities and idols who do all they can to show who they honestly are and do a lot of good and seem to effortlessly say the right things and offer honest support, some teen ones even too, but i think its overcrowded; and that oversaturation drowns plently of the best people who need more recognition out.

From a young age it was always just basic thoughts of 'they're beautiful' or 'i want to look after them/them to be there to look after me' 'they're really funny and i like making them laugh' i was just attracted to people, girls were pretty and so were boys a lot of the time.

Categorys and labels can complicate things for so many people, sometimes scare a lot of people off or isolate people when it could be easily avoided.

My mum in particular always looks back on the time i'd love her as a toddler, that amazing unconditional love young dependent kids have, and now its not the same. Only recently i really thought about it, becuase i thought that was all my fault for so many years; that lack of love, was all down to me. But i realized that as kids we grow into people with opinions, people with emotions, people who are intelligent enough to challenge parenting past and present, people who pick up on truama and negativity, and thats when parents often fail, as we pick up more on more on the flaws they've made, on the lack of attention, everything. Its not neccessarily just us being 'angsty', its also teens being legitimately frustrated about their families shortcomings as they recognize them. My mum always preaches that i'm lucky, that i could've had worse, which is true, but she mentions it so often without me even challenging her before hand it comes across as so self-richious, self concious, doubtful.

Unfortunately a sad part of owning pets is the fact that their lifespans are typically shorter then ours, its sad that your cats condition is a limbo of sorts, i can see why that must make it so much harder to begin to let go. 

All i can offer is to remember the great times, remember the comfort, that cat has lived a long and happy life with a compasionate owner, even if it has a condition that means it doesn't express the same personality and memory as before. Its difficult to let go of anything that holds a certain emotional place in your mind and life, but in time you'll accept what help he offered, how he held you up, and though hes gone now, those memories will never leave.

You've gotta force yourself up a bit sometimes, even if its tiring and doesnt seem worth it at the time. For me its sometimes stupid little things like getting up on time, making sure to eat square meals, make a complete schedule to look after yourself then worry about succeeding past just caring for your own body and living space. I know it might feel like its belittling almost to need to push to do basic things some days, but it will help it the long run.

The fact you've expressed how you know and want help here is great, you've made the first huge leap and the fact you've already gone through therapy is great too, you're actively trying to change, or atleast have been previously. Dont give up on that mindset.

I think pushing therapy aside isnt the best decision, even if you're busy, your mind and wellbeing comes first. Theres no point pushing yourself to barely make it through school/work if you dont feel yourself at all.

Mines sortve gotten more like a pool though over the last year or two, less like major episodes that would then stop and start and more like a constant that no longer inspires motivation but drains it, i think i lost control over it for whatever reason it overwhelmed me, and thats when its dangerous, thats when it cant be constructive and only destructive when left alone, even if it might still feel familiar and comforting to welcome that melanchole mind

I think talking to someone really helps, a proffessional or even just someone you trust/will offer understanding if for whatever reason you cant consider therapy right now.

The best thing is obviously just keep close contact with him, talk to him every day. But i wont go anymore into that becuase im sure thats basic.

As far as him getting help, even if he cant afford insurance to go through this the traditional healthcare route, one of the things i'd suggest would be a helpline (which could offer a stepping stone for him, even just for now as an outlet) i'd recomend samaritans or definitely a website called 420 changes direction foundation (which is a great help in general with so many helpful numbers and resources), both work internationally, but 420 is an american oganization so that would be suited better to this situation.

The second thing i could suggest is definitely getting him to look into volenteer organizations and therapy groups in the area since they are normally independently set up and not working off any official authority and often work of donations/outside indep funding. I'm pretty sure there are ways for him to apply for free councelling too under healthcare but i'm not really knowledgable on that unfortunately.

Don't base your whole judgement of yourself on what one or a few people say, get them out of your life as soon as you can- becuase i promise you most people arent so simple minded when it comes to attraction.

I'm not the most experienced with serious relationships like many other people, but dont ever let it begin to control your thought process- I've learnt it just makes people more self concious and introvert generally. Just break the cycle- someone tells you youre undesirable uneededly? Say or even just think 'no, i like this about me...' (even if its just one little thing) or 'well why would i care what you think all too much' Invalidate them before you go to invalidate yourself. Learn to *like* yourself- thats the first step."
