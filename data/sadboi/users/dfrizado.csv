depression,f81m6xq,t3_dyazjo,1574171724.0,"I understand your feeling. I was an alcoholic and I wanted to get sober and I just didn’t know how to, it was years of depression and self medicating and I was just miserable but I saw no way out. I’d be driving on the highway and I’d think: if I veered my car into the middle maybe it would flip over repeatedly and I’d die and I’d go wicked fast and then just chicken out because I couldn’t do that to my kids. I thought about killing myself so many times, but I just never got the guts. So then I started thinking what if I just had a heart attack? That would be the best way out. Well, 3 years ago I got my wish sord of. My heart was days from giving out. I was in multiorgan failure, I didn’t die though, instead I developed a brain lesion on my spinal cord that resulted in left sided paralysis. From my brain to my toes, so I couldn’t use my left side of my body, I was in a diaper, I couldn’t talk or eat well, I couldn’t even breathe well. My brain was fried and now I wanted to die even more because I was in a literal hell and I couldn’t even kill myself because I relied on 24 hour care. I finally got strong enough to sit up in a wheelchair. My kids cried every night on the phone because they missed me so much. I wouldn’t let them see me like that. But something happened. I just finally broke. I had nothing. It was Christmas Day and I was alone in the hospital. My husband and kids were off doing things. And I was so alone and that was it. I knew I had to get better. I knew I had to stop feeling sorry for myself. I worked on my physical strength and I worked on my mental health. And although it’s been a long 3 years, I am walking normal and I am feeling the best I ever have. I get sad thinking what if... and also... what if the accident I wanted to do caused even worse damage than the alcohol did. I mean it sucked being in that rehab. I know how you felt. But I gets better, it doesn’t get better if you kill yourself and it doesn’t get better you sitting around and not doing anything. With anything it requires work, but you can get out of it. I wish you the best of everything✨"

lifecoaching,euwubbo,t1_eutr13a,1564079665.0,What kind of condition? Are you depressed? Life coaching will definitely help motivate you and help you get over those speed bumps that are slowing you down. That being said life coaching is no substitute for a therapist if there is a significant amount of depression.
spirituality,erx9byu,t3_c450vj,1561377670.0,"Some people have offered some great ideas. Ideas I would have shared since practicing mindfulness. When people project their opinions on you, most times people are upset because they believe them to be true. You need to find you true self your authentic self. Once you have stripped away your insecurities and you know exactly who you are, then when people project their opinions on you, it doesn’t sound like a harsh criticism it sounds more like a child spewing words. Little by little people’s opinions don’t matter. You know who you are and no matter what they say it is just their opinion and not facts about you. 

Once you realize their is no validity to those words you handle situations differently by not getting upset or flying of the handle, instead of reacting to it emotionally, you can respond to it rationally, in time you won’t even respond to it. 

Personally, I will explain how this has helped me. My mother and a few “friends” would have opinions on how I raised my kids and how I handled my sobriety. At first I would get emotional and think they knew better than me and I would get sad and anxious and so many other emotions which made me bite back even harder. After practice mindfulness, I found myself. I had learned to love who I am and why I make certain decisions. I learned that my decisions maybe aren’t what my mother or “friends” would have chose, but this isn’t their life and they aren’t living with the consequences. I chose to not explain why I chose what I chose because I don’t need to explain myself to anyone. Once people see that strength, they back off and like a cycle once you see it working you are able to extend that thinking to another situation. I would definitely look up mindfulness. There are certain teachers who teach you how to step back and understand why you feel the way you do and how to respond to it. 

I do not live up to anyone’s opinions of me, I live up to my standards, I am enough when I know I’ve truly given my best. I love and do what I want everyday. In doing so, I have been able to be more compassionate to others and judge others less. I don’t try to lead people stray from their path, but am still able to offer guidance. I wish you good findings in your research✨"
spirituality,ereyzg1,t3_c1j9o5,1560796130.0,"Very true, I started my journey after I was paralyzed from malnutrition from alcoholism. I was told I would never walk again and only 2% of people with my condition (CPM) live without any effects. I was left with neuropathy, depression, anxiety and blood pressure at 33 years old. I did it to myself, but I never thought drinking alcohol would lead to that. After I got out of the hospital I worked hard physically and regained by ability to walk/talk/eat again. After a year of being sober I was a zombie from the meds they had me on and I thought it may affect my sobriety. So I got off all my meds and started taking CBD oil. I did that for about 6 months and knew I needed to do more. 

I started practicing mindfulness and I stripped myself down to my core and I be my authentic true self. It left my sobriety stronger than ever, my depression had gotten better and my anxiety was gone. My neuropathy still was bothersome, so I started eating way healthier and living as organic as I could. I still felt a yearning for something.

I started working on my chakras and meditating and I have a vision, I wasn’t sure what had happened. I knew it wasn’t a dream because I was awake, but I went somewhere. It happened again and again, each time led to a different place but all connected. It was scary at first and then I stopped expecting anything and just took it as a message. I’ve had about 6 now, and I’m not sure still where my future is, but I’m not worried. 

I have learned to love myself, I have learned to respond to situations/people/energy with more clarity. I live more consciously and I try not to take anything for granted. I have asked the Universe for a few things, mostly for help with specific things that were going on in my life and the universe answered with abundance in multiple ways. 

Now, that I’ve seen where I’m being led, I could never go back. I went step by step trying new things, not knowing what would happen. I trusted my intuition in every situation and I can tell you that I am loving my best life ever. It’s truly amazing when you can just let it be. Of course I still work towards an end result, I still have goals I need to meet, but I don’t worry I’m making the wrong decision. I don’t worry about other people opinions of me. I went from being an unemployed disabled alcoholic to a mindful Lightworker, healing myself, friends and family with energy, crystals and reiki. My disabilities are still there, but do not affect me daily and do not hold me back from my path I’m heading. I do meditate everyday, I do get up early and do yoga, I do read oracle cards everyday, I do eat clean, I do love with all my heart. I do offer encouragement to all around me and I’m able to do all of it while raising my kids, being a wife and living my best life ever. It started with a yearning for a better life. 

Don’t give up, research new things, try new things, stop worrying, trust your gut, ignore haters and negativity. Don’t overwhelm yourself with a brand new life; start small, get comfortable with a new regimen and then add something else. I am still me! I am hyper when I talk about something that excites me, but I am sober from alcohol. Cutting out toxins helps with so much, physically and mentally: the food we eat, the air we breath, the chemicals we put on our bodies, it all adds up. 

There is a shift of energy happening and people are noticing it. Reduce your contaminants and toxins so that you can feel the positive energy and use that energy to heal yourself💚"
