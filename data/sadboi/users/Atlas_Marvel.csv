Long story short I ended up leaving before getting a degree but I decided to keep moving forward and I found a job. Doesn't pay much but I don't regret it. I'll work my way up to a more profitable position but at my own pace.

socialanxiety,folemlx,t3_g7yu4p,1587860583.0,"I felt the same way. I waited to get my license until after highschool, but then I instantly went to college and decided to live on campus so I never had to drive. After deciding college was doing more harm than good, I finally got my first job a few weeks ago (I'm 20 years old) so I'm forced to drive, but I got the closest job possible so it's not too bad. I luckily joined a driver's ed class before getting my license so I had a lot of practice with instructors who were patient with me. Driving short distances in general is what helped me the most after completing driver's ed. I still avoid driving as much as possible but if I have to drive I'll take the shortest routes. Use as many resources as you can, like Google Maps or weather apps so you can take as much stress out of your commute as possible. There are features that show you the routes with the lowest traffic or which routes are shorter. If you know what to expect in terms of traffic, road conditions, and directions you need to take, it'll make everything much easier. Trust me, technology is your friend. Just make sure to take things as slow as you need. Make sure you're in a good mood, you've eaten, and you're physically well enough to drive. That's what they taught us in driver's ed, anyway. Remember you can go slightly slower than the speed limit until you feel comfortable with going faster. Also, you can kinda cheat by following a stranger in front of you and just copying them, but watch your spedometer. It's the small things that really make a difference since they all add up in the end. Good luck to you."

It's so hard to be around people, especially when they try talking to me and all I can do is be cold and plain because I can't risk getting my heart broken, being embarrassed, or sharing way too much. Those people quickly decide to stay away from me from then on or at least minimize interacting with me as much as possible. I want to be regular and friendly but I can't help who I've become. Sadness and failure is all I've known. I simply don't have the energy or motivation to try as much as I used to. I feel bad but then accept that I couldn't have done any better. I refuse to force myself to be someone I'm not, even to make a friend. And because of the times I've been hurt, I take a lot of things personally and overthink everything. I can't stand being potentially hurt or exposed in any way. I just wish I could at least come off as likeable or approachable.
