Edit: I finally read all of that and yes it's a pattern, but I still remember her making a reddit post that described literally everything she did this time but without mitski being involved. It makes me scared that she's just going to keep doing this to other celebrities. In the last link she seems like she's not fully taking responsibility for her actions."

They're consciously making the decision. So like I said, they can fuck off. I don't fucking care about being nice. 

At this point I'm mostly disgusted by the useless piece of shit mods who've allowed this post to stay up even though I sent them TWO messages about it. Shit like this doesn't happen in other subs and it shouldn't happen here, either! 

As for drugs vs trauma, I would think it would get better for drug induced symptoms faster as long as the person quits drugs, but usually people who do drugs have underlying mental problems as well. It's an all around destructive idea and it needs to be taken off of this sub."
