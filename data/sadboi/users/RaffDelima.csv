Almost everything I’ve seen Trump in policy/conspiracies/and exact wording of phrases has usually floated with his supporters first. 

Most likely he goes to forums of his supporters, steals their ideas, claims it as his own and his supporters think he’s some brilliant mind reader that “does what the people want”(aka them). 

I’ve seen way too many times the EXACT wording from his supporters. Not even a deviation from what they say, an exact 1:1 phrasing. I’ve seen this happen way too many times for it not to be a coincidence. 

They fed into his ego and his feeds into their egos that they’re better then everyone else. Which in turn they feed his ego again causing the cycle to repeat. 

Just like an ouroboros of stupidity."

rant,fmkk2zi,t3_fvsc5i,1586157672.0,"Not so fun fact. I’ve lived with depression and ever since I was a kid until my late teens, I’ve tried to kill my self quite a few times. Nearly was successful a few times. 

10 years ago I found my way out by finding what made me happy and fulfilled. I found my profession (filmmaking) that gave me not only a goal for my life when I didn’t have one, it also gave me a way to understand psychologically what I was feeling and thinking and put it all down in writing. I began to understand myself as a person, what my wants, desires, etc were. 

I then did everything I could in order to take care of my mental health, took the proper medication (which helped clear my mind to begin to getting better), then I slowly added other things like cognitive behavioral therapy, keeping mental upkeep with a therapist and proper diet and exercise (in my case helped quite a bit). 

But also other things that came in my life also helped put things into perspective. I lost a friend to suicide a few years ago. Not a day goes by when I think of all the things he’s missing because he’s dead. Sure life can be an annoying pain in the ass and you think dying stops all of the problems. But all the good things in life, all the joys you get in life, will no longer continue as well. The people you know who care about you, will have to feel that much emptier without you. 

And with this in mind I’ve tried to just take a step back enjoy the bits of good that come in and savor each moment. Not easy but doing it over and over helps. 

All of this takes time and consistently. This may be corny and I fucking hated hearing this. But it does get easier, you just have to keep at it every day. 

From someone who was treatment resistant and constantly longed for death pretty much everyday and brought myself 180, it’s possible to get through this. 

Please take the time to take care of your mental help, talk with someone, just do anything you can to take care of yourself. It’s more then worth it."

When we ALL have to do something he automatically does the opposite then gets angry at us for not doing things his way.  He yells and berates is for taking this seriously. 


My father also believes that since his older then everyone else, he just knows better and automatically anything my mom or I do he thinks it’s stupid and unnecessary. When my mom and I wholeheartedly do something (like try to wash and disinfect ourselves when we come back) he goes out of his way to try and prove us wrong. 

Hell if there a flesh eating disease plaguing the world right now, he’d try to lick the rail bars to prove everyone else wrong. And then on the hospital bed succumbing to the virus he’ll swear up and down that we’re wrong and that it isn’t the virus and that he didn’t get it from licking the rails.

Worst for a good chunk of my life I’ve tried to commit suicide and whenever I was close to killing myself id go into a panic and talk to my folks about it, he’d literally put his fingers in his ears and yell “la la la, I don’t want to hear this, la la la, get out of here” and would act like a fucking child. He doesn’t like talking about it because it makes him uncomfortable. 

I think his uncle killed himself (which he only vaguely hinted at but of course will never bother to tell me). So it’s a subject he never wanted to talk about. 

And worse when someone like Robin Williams and one of my friends killed themselves from being bullied in the military my father would just blurt that out. And I can’t ask him to not say it because it upsets me. He would just double down and intentionally try to piss me off, because he knows that upsets me and finds it funny. And if I get angry he just says “oh stop being so sensitive”

He lies to me and that he “never knew” about me wanting to commit suicide (despite my attempts since I was 7 due to a teacher’s aide in elementary bullying me to try and kill myself) and making fun of me for it (again he like to piss me off as a joke). 

God if it wasn’t for the support of my mom I would’ve killed myself over a decade ago.

And yeah. I love my father and all but I share that feeling 100%. Seriously go fuck yourself if you think it’s the coward’s way out. We don’t want to die. It’s just at times it seems like the only solution. Hell it’s the fear of dying that kept me from killing myself in the first place."

So this ships is perfect for that. Although I’ve started buying other ships (and rebought some old olds I enjoyed using) and started to build them for specific purposes. 

So for now I’m enjoying doing the other things the game has to offer, without the limitations from a lack of credits.

The only things I can’t see myself doing is griefing and pirating. I mean, I can’t even bring myself to screw with the NPC’s much less an actual player. 

But yeah I just next on my re-evaluated to do list is:

-Probably half or most of the stuff you’ve mentioned. 

-Join the fuel rats, help rebuild broken space stations (which I didn’t know that was an option), just in general player factions that help. I’ve found out so many just from this post alone. 

-Help fighting Thargoids (of course that won’t be for a while). 

-Rescue people from burning stations (that current event might help. 

-Find our which faction to join, finding out which is lore wise the less shitty of the bunch. Leaning towards is Li Yong-Rui  because at the moment my home station is in Ray Gateway in Diaguandri (so I have some gratitude). And for my understanding of this game I know he’s independent and tech based. 

-Complete Federation and Empire ranks because...ships and locked systems if I’m being honest. Don’t like being denied access to stuff. 

-Getting the Sol permit because hey it’s home. (Also why I’ve started ranking up with the Federation first). Also I want to access Jameson memorial as a potential new base. 

-Visit the John Jameson crash site. 

-(something not in game). Figure out more about the lore and story in this game because I have no goddamn clue what’s going on to be honest. Should have done this first, my bad. 

-Honestly now that I’ve just started to build my foundation I hopefully can do a little more."
self,ff2lbxq,t3_er9gxh,1579511531.0,I mean the thought has come across my mind but I try not to think about that. I honestly don’t need more reasons to be awkward in public.
rant,ff2l8r6,t3_er4q38,1579511401.0,Pretty much all of the machines in my area either need me to do it in advance or work when it’s already in the machine. Makes things go a bit faster for me.
EliteDangerous,ff2l1z7,t1_ff2kklb,1579511121.0,"I already unlocked the engineer for the FSD boost and I am starting to unlock the guardian drive boost (just got the blueprints and most  of the materials). 

As for ships I loved my python (planning on rebuying another one) and I personally love the Kraits as well. Might get a Phantom since it’s better for exploration (hard to pick I like them both). I also have a Diamondback Explorer that I also love using (honestly I didn’t expect to like it that much but was pleasantly surprised). 

Well all in all I like the ships that I’ve used so far. Hopefully I can start building up a fleet of my favorite ships. There’s so many this game has to offer. So at least there’s that."
EliteDangerous,ff2knop,t1_ff2j9pj,1579510549.0,"Yeah well. I think I found a use for it at least. Might as well put that ship to good use. Some people have recommended helping rebuild stations or try helping the fuel rats. 

That I might get into. The whole point of that ship was to get it to help others. I may have found something to do thanks to the community itself."
EliteDangerous,ff1p4ps,t1_ff1oma4,1579483054.0,Honestly I’ve been looking into that as well. And I just read that the anaconda is a good choice. Definitely leaning towards that direction.
EliteDangerous,ff1mjgi,t1_ff1ewu8,1579481652.0,Ooh. This sounds interesting. Let me take a bit more of a look. Any chance this works for PS4 as well?
EliteDangerous,ff19w80,t1_ff0ywyp,1579476673.0,"Actually I had originally a reason for getting an anaconda. I just like helping people. So I looked for the best way to make money to get the Anaconda as a rescue ship. I have no earthly clue on how to do that now. 

I can’t think of any other way then going to the burning stations and loading up passengers in need. I know there’s that event right now, so I could do that. 

Honestly I probably should’ve planned a little better."
EliteDangerous,ff0uxoj,t1_ff0uld7,1579472505.0,Fair point. I like exploring too but I need to engineer this a little better for me to get the most out of it.
EliteDangerous,ff0usy2,t1_ff0ue7p,1579472460.0,I mean I love this ship and I quickly made enough money to buy a second one. I just wish I could do something helpful with this.
EliteDangerous,ff0sjcy,t1_ff0qrm6,1579471892.0,"Jameson memorial is one I’d want to go next but I don’t have the permit to go there yet. Still new but I just have a few more ranks to go. 

And maybe I’ll try out the other ones later they sound nice."
shittysuperpowers,ff0gnmu,t3_er0zp5,1579468685.0,How is there a downside to this?
rant,fep2huv,t3_eq5zir,1579310668.0,"23? I have seen idiots in their 30’s and 40’s who think this behavior is acceptable. In all honestly this mentality was always childish. I’m 27 now but I’ve never pulled pulled of this crap when I was younger for that reason. 

But yeah you’re 100% correct. People should act their age."
offmychest,felf3aa,t1_felez0u,1579220678.0,"I know. Been through this before. Doesn’t make it easier. 

And thank you for you let words. Honestly I’m glad she’s no longer in pain."
offmychest,feldia1,t3_epf0mc,1579219624.0,"Yeah I know the feeling was struggling with suicidal tendencies for the longest time. Cut it close a few times myself. 

However a few years back I lost a friend who killed himself in the military. Seeing everyone around him suffering the way they did was kind of a sobering experience. Kind of made me step back I think about things."
DecidingToBeBetter,fel9aqc,t1_fel7foh,1579216867.0,"It’s not that we’re different exactly. My main issue is that I have some family members that decide to intentionally make themselves another obstacle for me to deal with. 

For example I’ve managed to convince a some of my family members to make better life decisions (although they will never admit it). But my father absolutely refuses to do the the because 
1. He HAS to do the opposite as everyone else 
2. Because he doesn’t do it he tries to force everyone else to quit. In his mind if he doesn’t do it, everyone else has to stop. 

And for the rest of my family they have a problem with HOW I diet and exercise. Problem is they don’t provide me with solutions, just complaints. 

That’s the reason for me to distance myself."
DecidingToBeBetter,fekzcsb,t1_fekyacp,1579210753.0,"Well more specifically making an effort to improve is already difficult don’t need additional obstacles. Negativity is something I’ve lived with my whole life. I can deal with that. 

But for me this is somewhat of a difficult position. I love my family and I was always taught to love and respect family. So trying to break away a bit is not easy but I realize I can’t improve if I don’t."
