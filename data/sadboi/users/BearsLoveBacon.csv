Existentialism,fkbnruf,t3_fhi5d1,1584036438.0,"Isn't atheism just the firm belief that god for sure doesn't exist? Wouldn't the universe challenge that notion when you say ""I know a god doesn't exist!"" by creating one that very same moment? In that same vein I guess that makes out the Universe to be God since it brings itself into existence like a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

Not tryna stirr up a storm or poke holes in your theory, I actually really like it and it's making me think. I myself am an agnostic because I always thought the notion of saying with 100% certainty that there isn't a god is just as silly as saying that there is one. I can barely tell you what I ate for lunch yesterday let alone claim such grandiose statements about the very nature and essence of the cosmos. Maybe it's a little masochistic but I prefer not knowing (though it can induce strong feelings loneliness and doubt), it's lot more fun to entertain multiple ideas and play with them than coming out right and saying what is and what isn't. It's okay to not know. If anything the not knowing is necessary before any knowing even takes place! Just my two cents. Interesting post yo"

Existentialism,fgi95rw,t3_eyiuds,1580812177.0,"This was a fascinating post. Iâ€™ve arrived towards similar conclusions in a faith centered system based on nietzcheâ€™s concept of amor fati and living for the sake of living. I think we often get caught up in our very western mode of living that we should be happy at all times and if we are not that means we arenâ€™t â€˜livingâ€™ right. This can be very paradoxical because if you end up feeling sad at one point or another (which we all do) you then become even more sad that you are not happy (which you have been told your entire life that you should be) thus making you even more sad and the vicious loop tightens around you.

Im glad to hear you have found a resting ground from existential suffering and you have nudged me to me give this book a try. Thank you internet friend, safe cosmic travels and be well ðŸ’«ðŸ’•ðŸŒ¸"
