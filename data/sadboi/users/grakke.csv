LetsNotMeet,fqsccca,t1_fqrf6pb,1589603554.0,Samantha Josephson. This was at my university and it scarred all of us. She was supposed to graduate in the same ceremony as me..there was an empty chair with a gown and cap on it for her. “What’s my name” is an entire campaign here. You did the right thing OP.

KillingEve,fq9j50p,t1_fq99477,1589199770.0,There was an article that came out after Ep 4 where the showrunner was talking about how Dasha “didn’t think through killing Niko” and that Eve would be suspicious because she knows Villanelle would never kill Niko in front of her. So Eve is going to see right through it.

depression,fpvepw8,t3_gea6mo,1588943105.0,"I REALLY was suffering from this thought for about three years. All the way through college, I realized every single person I considered my  ""best friend"" did not feel the same and had someone they were closer with. I'm lucky enough to have a sister that is close in age that I am extremely close with, but it still killed me knowing that none of the people I felt close to felt the same about me.

Then out of the blue, me and one of those friends just got closer and closer and now we are completely inseparable. Point being, things change. People change. Circumstances change. You never know what could happen, so just keep reaching out. One of your friendships may change, or you may meet someone new. But if you continually support those around you, you never know what can happen."

OP said it’s the prettiest cake they’ve ever made, not the prettiest cake in the world and they just wanted to show what they accomplished. I think it just comes off as rude to offer up unsolicited criticism when that wasn’t the purpose of the post.
