ID_News,fqoch4c,t3_gjv0wp,1589512170.0,"For the lazy:

The WHO recommends that between 3-12% of tested cases coming out positive shows that a given population is properly fighting COVID19

39 US states are below 12% 
12 US states are above 12%

Most states above 12% cases testing positive are between 30-100% of all cases being tested coming out as positive.

This is a huge range and shows that America isn’t effectively combating the pandemic or testing for it properly due to lack of resources, apathy, and probably all the political polarization over the issue.

A lower proportion of tested cases being positive means the state is managing the pandemic effectively enough to consider a re-opening strategy."
