Design,fq8pdu6,t3_ggyquv,1589171867.0,"Fashion logos are unique in that they follow trends and don't have strict brand guidelines on how the logo should be used. The logos appear on different clothes, concept stores and digital every season because fashion changes all the time. This calls for something simple and graphically eye catching that can be reconstructed in multiple ways. Take Burberry for example, they've applied their new logo in numerous cuts and sizes on their clothes. Others like Chanel, LV and Fendi have staple items with logomania for decades. Others like Ralph Lauren and CK play with logos from time to time.

Also all the sans typefaces for these high fashion brands are all different. It's difficult to get used to but I like it because it's mean to appeal to younger people. Also I think these brands are trying to get rid of their vintage history through the type choices. Hopefully they'll bring it back in a tasteful way."

If possible maybe even a video demo (that's a lot of work haha).

UI/web designers are known to be good graphic designers too so try and work on type hierarchy at least. Just knowing the right typeface and type size and composition is a game changer to the details.

design_critiques,fq1x0cq,t1_fq1k0l5,1589050607.0,"Sorry I sidetracked what the post was asking for.

Portfolio criticism.
Firstly I actually enjoy the ui examples but they are not organised well. You have a website showing examples of websites and mobile sites so this is already a challenge in itself. It doesn't feel user friendly. I would prefer to see user journeys and flow diagrams, more examples, less explanation. Some paragraphs are distracting your ui examples so looking at type hierarchy would be helpful to keep your work in focus. Some projects also have 5 examples than others have 3, some don't have enough information so it feels a little threadbare. Your examples are great but are not presented consistently. I would recommend looking at good ui/ux websites to see how your projects can flow nicer. 

Website itself
When I click developments and design links, they lead me to the French version of the website. Not sure if this is an error or intention.

Also I read it as 50 UI design and 50 graphics. You don't have to be a professional photographer but I guarantee you it will make your UI even better because you are experimenting, coming up with new ideas and challenging ur capabilities and becoming better. In doing so, you show how creative, adaptable and resourceful you can be. You can create passion projects and show how ui is built around the content, not the content compromised to fit the ui (does that make sense?), new ui for brand guidelines, custom ui, good quality content but in small mbs etc. plus you're being resourceful and have having good taste is always employable in a creative industry

Btw do you have an Instagram of your portfolio, I love seeing how designers on social media because you get to see their personality!"
careerguidance,fq1p7hs,t3_ggg4da,1589047708.0,"Science journalism is the best one. Believe it or not climate change is a social issue not a scientific one. 71% of cO2 is created by oil companies like Exxonmobil, bp and shell and other companies. I'm certain all scientists and engineers know the steps to take to prevent climate change but the reason it isn't happening is because countries aren't committed and there's a lack of scientific journalism in mainstream media. In science journalism, you need to properly communicate what's going on to main media outlets because it's really complex stuff. You have the potential to change the way the public thinks, politicians, lawmakers think, the entire zeitgeist. The issue is that scientists literally know what to do but they can't perform them because the media has stopped their credibility. The media has treated climate change as a political issue and it doesn't have to be. They ask ""do you believe in climate change?"" when really the questions they should be asking are ""is renewable or nuclear better for the environment?"". And they've conjured up this narrative that the  West should point fingers at china and India for pollution, well, guess who hires their services? The west who originally used to pollute!!

On top of that, companies promote greenwashing and sustainability (just buzzwords really) and they have lobbyists to weakens environmental laws. If you can steer the conversation of climate change in the right direction it would solve a lot of problems. I remember before gay marriage was legalised in the USA in 2015/16, it had like decades of public controversy and then suddenly social media created this positive momentum leading up to it. This also applies to the metoo movement. Greta thunberg being green is also huge because of social media. You get people talking, and policies can reflect and make better change.

I don't believe being an engineer and architect prevents climate change. Only some jobs do like environmental scientists or researchers but even then it's iffy. Teslas are cool but batteries are extremely polluting. You have 'efficient' and 'eco' practices but your job supports the extraction of minerals and converting them into products which creates more waste? Wow the hypocrisy of developed countries. Climate change is a tricky subject and the real sustainable friends of the planet are the tribes living in the Amazon."

I’ve added these people on LinkedIn and comment and like a post every now and then but I don’t eat lunch with them every 6 months.
findapath,fkhmird,t1_fkhlche,1584201920.0,"I've only had a social media internship and it was mainly photography and copywriting. I've spent the last year saying ""oh I'm gonna upskill and update my portfolio!"" but to no avail because all I keep seeing are mistakes, no progress. Because of that I feel like I'm not even good enough for a baseline graphic design job."
findapath,fkhjl7r,t3_figeny,1584200292.0,"What are your reasons for getting these degrees? Going back to uni seems like a popular option in this list. Getting a job is a milestone. Getting degrees have to amount to something even if you intend to be a researcher. I know 2 people in their 30's who have gotten a masters and from their experience, a masters was treated as a salary booster. Since they already had worked it looks impressive and attracts a higher salary. I'd say figure out what your goal is and then plan out what is the most impactful order of achieving the goal."
Design,fkhh2vj,t3_fihqg2,1584198659.0,Following this post. Seems like a battle between iPad Pro and the Wacom. Could any experienced users list their pros and cons for them? I also suck at drawing off the screen so I need a tablet that shows exactly where my pen tool is.
careerguidance,fkhg0xy,t3_fi7zfr,1584197925.0,It's made me a lot more stressed. I'm graduating at the end of the year and don't want to be jobless because I can't attend an in person interview.

solotravel,fkg8kpg,t3_fgkwmd,1584152700.0,"21F, was studying in the uk, travelled to the Netherlands and austria on my own because I couldn’t get people to come. Take small steps if you’re nervous. I eased my way into solo travel. I went to Edinburgh with a friend group and saw how they managed. Travelled solo to Iceland for a tour. Flew to Netherlands and met up with an online friend there and he showed me around. Then in Vienna, I spent days alone walking around  a big city but enjoyed it after. Note: this was spread over a few months, I returned to my home city pretty often to recollect my thoughts. I know this travel sounds luxurious for someone young but I had been saving up for exchange for 3 years and didn’t even travel in my own city.

Mum kept saying “contact me everyday! I want to know what you’re doing every hour of the day”. So her paranoia caught onto me.

An old friend of mine has been travelling solo since she was about 19. She took it slowly. She met up with her online friends (she knew for 10 years through gaming) who were in Malaysia. In those instances you have to be careful but they’d known each other for more than 10 years and trusted each other."
solotravel,fkg7liy,t1_fk85rx2,1584151968.0,Can’t assume everyone under 30 is into kpop. I like to think younger people are more open-minded and less judgemental when it comes to diverse demographics
MakeupRehab,fkg30ou,t3_fi9t3n,1584148704.0,"I can confess I did the exact thing, the same amount of money over 3 months during Black Friday. I started to realise materials only helped my anxiety a bit. I overestimated it's worth. I know it’s a lot of money but I'm happy I have it to help me in hard times."
graphic_design,fk7zh4l,t1_fk7cz6z,1583946512.0,I can use onedrive but I’m graduating soon and I won’t have access to the software. So I need to get the files off since I don’t wanna store everything on my hard drive

jeffreestarcosmetics,fj64fl4,t3_fbmhbr,1583056187.0,The lower lash line colour is gorge! Looks like a better quality dupe for the blue in the abh norvina palette which is patchy af (or just not user friendly)
