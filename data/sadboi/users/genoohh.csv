DebateAChristian,fqatygw,t1_fqahxwn,1589225238.0,Faith is not described as an absence of evidence in the Bible. It is the assurance of things hoped for and the conviction of things not seen. This problem arises when one thinks that they can commit themselves to a metaphysical position completely independent of an epistemological position.
TrueChristian,fpxdme8,t1_fpxbt4o,1588980612.0,Sin puts us all under condemnation. The real question is what will you do with your sin?
TrueChristian,fpx9ric,t1_fpx6j0c,1588978419.0,Either you will pay for your sins by yourself or Jesus will. Look up penal substitutionary atonement.
TrueChristian,fpm9fyb,t3_ge2u8l,1588728278.0,"“But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere. For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things? For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God’s word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.”
‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭2:14-17‬ ‭ESV‬‬

We are the aroma of Christ. That’s why some people immediately are very open and welcoming and others immediately reject and try to push away."
DebateAChristian,fov0xp8,t1_fou9o0g,1588093597.0,"There’s no issue or missing steps... Jesus said he didn’t come to bring peace, but a sword. His word is the sword, piercing and dividing. When God separates the dark from the light, is it not simultaneous? His sheep hear his word and follow him and he’ll not lose a single one. If you don’t hear his voice, it’s because you’re not his sheep. I don’t have to account for your lack of understanding, I can explain for all of eternity, but unless God gives you eyes to see and hears to hear, you’ll just find something else to disagree with. 

He is still gathering the elect for his kingdom and putting his enemies under his feet. He must rule and reign until every authority, rule, and power is brought into subjection under him.  The last enemy to be defeated is death."
DebateAChristian,fou59l1,t1_fou28l8,1588076553.0,"Yes. How did Jesus often speak about the Kingdom? 
“Repent for the kingdom is at hand”, “You’re not far from it”, “it’s in the midst of you”, “it has come upon you”. Daniel 7 talked much about it also. 
Ephesians 2:6 - past tense “raised” up.... “seated” with him in the heavenlies."
DebateAChristian,fotcz2u,t1_fot46lv,1588050408.0,"I can’t stop you from reading your presuppositions into the text, but I’d invite you to stop. Jesus is clear when he speaks first about the desolation, then explains the tribulations they’re going to go through leading up to the desolation. Again, “immediately after the tribulation of those days.” Sun, moon, stars judgement language same as Isaiah 13:10. Son of man coming in the clouds... Isaiah 19:1. Loud trumpet call... Isaiah 27:13 or of you prefer Rev. 11:16-18. The elect are in His Kingdom. It’s right there in the text."
DebateAChristian,fot3192,t1_foscxtk,1588043524.0,"So it is all about Gods judgement. My friend, God does not deliver His people out of tribulations, they are saved THROUGH them. Noah and the ark, Daniel and the lions den, Christians and the desolation by Roman armies (flee to the mountains), etc. They were delivered."

DebateAChristian,foq8quc,t1_fonc3jo,1587986896.0,"Matthew 24:39-“Immediately after the tribulation...”, not desolation.
Revelation 1:9- John says he’s a partner with the 7 churches in the tribulation. 
Jesus, being God in the flesh is using the same God language as in the Old Testament when speaking of coming judgement. Sun, moon, and stars not giving light, look at Isaiah 13:10. This chapters all about Gods judgement on Babylon, and He uses the Medes to bring  His judgement. Same thing in Isaiah 19:1 about riding on a cloud. God brings judgement to Egypt. Jesus is giving them all these indicators to let them know when he is near to bringing judgement. 
Matthew 24:32-35 - when you see all these things, know that the season is near. It will happen in that generation. He gives them a broad time frame of that generation. 
24:36 - the season you will know when it’s near, but the day and the hour is not given to you, just stay ready or you will get caught up in the judgement. 

It’s easy to lose the context once you start digging into the chapter, but remember the context is about the destruction of the temple. In Matthew 23 he’s pronouncing woes and declares the temple/house is going to be destroyed. Then in 24, the disciples ask when."

abortion,f08ovz3,t3_d3gifi,1568484982.0,"Don’t do it. You will regret it everyday for the rest of your life. My mother had my twin brother and I a week after she turned 20 and she said we were the best thing that ever happened to her. Do you think she was ready then? Do you think she had her fairytale?
She still eventually went on to finish her nursing degree and become a top nurse on her floor because she wanted us to be proud of her, and we are. 
I know that she has had an abortion after us. We’ve talked about it, as difficult as it is, but she has found forgiveness in Jesus Christ. It’s one of the things that has led her to repent and for her faith, so thank God for that at least. But it is something she regrets so deeply and profoundly and we cant help but imagine how different things could be with more siblings."

Evidence based apologetics are okay at best. Presuppositional is the way to go and I think the most God honoring.  I highly recommend “How to Answer the Fool” on YouTube by Sye Ten Bruggencate.

Once again, this data was gathered by observing with my eyes and ears when my coworker cracked open a fresh new can of Diet Coke.

Unfortunately Ole Greg retired before I could present him with a printed out graph and a six-pack. I planned to present him with that little retirement gift at the end of the day but he disappeared at lunch time never to be seen again.
