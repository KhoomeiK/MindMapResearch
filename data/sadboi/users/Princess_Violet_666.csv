BPD,fiun0sn,t1_fiukx06,1582744506.0,"This post is so insulting!!! 

Just because you have a partner, that doesn’t make your BPD just go away within 6 months!! 

And you’re totally wrong about the therapy and anti-depressants, there are SO MANY reports that day BPD is resistant to treatment. The only therapy that truly works is DBT, meds don’t work all they do is ease the symptoms. 

Telling someone who is just posting an opinion that because their partner didn’t magically recover while they were together this means they must have a mental illness! Wtf! That’s horrible and insensitive. 

I’ve had stable partners in the past and they didn’t ‘fix’ me, the only person who can fix you is you."

I don’t know why this one has made me go cray cray! It truly is absolute shite. 
Thank you, other people have said the same, like it’s a lot of drama and upset for only knowing him a few weeks ... meh I hate this! 

When are you going on your date with your guy?"

BPD,feuei9t,t3_eqi6t2,1579385763.0,"Mate this is literally me rn. 

Meet a few different guys, I really liked one and then he said he couldn’t commit or give me any attention, so fuck that. 
Talking to a few others but I’m not that excited by them. 
Then I met this one guy, OMG it was amazing. Our first date lasted 5 days ... after that we talked everyday for a week for hours. We met once more and since then he’s been really weird and distant. I asked him about it and he goes “I’m just not 100% sure, my last relationship fucked me up so I’m terrified of them now” then “feels like something isn’t quite right” ... I’m properly gutted, I thought this was going  somewhere and I thought he really like me but clearly not. I feel really mugged off and misled. I said I’d leave him alone and let him have space but then he still texts a little bit. 
I need to be told where I’m at, I don’t do well with waiting or uncertainty. If you’re not sure about me then don’t keep me hanging on it’s just fucking torture!! But I don’t want him to leave so I’m trying to be patient but it’s killing me. 
I have other guys asking me on dates and just don’t know what to do!

Have you explained to him just how scared you are? And that you would really appreciate it if he would give you some comfort, or even comforting words, to soothe the little in you?

I- like you- do it to protect myself. For years any relationship that was stable and safe, I destroyed it by leaving or breaking up with people. I dont know why I do this, Ive somehow been convinced my unconscious that stable is boring ... but the alternative is intense relationships, that equally dont work out, or being alone. I wish I could just live with nice and stable but it sends me crazy and then I act out and hurt others by erratically changing or being cold, or I start splitting which is just confusing for everyone.  
It just fucking sucks."

I did try to get him to read things, I sent him this great article but he refused to read it. I feel now I have said that I want to leave he is maybe just saying anything to try and keep me around? 
There are certain things that a Daddy can give you, if they don't come naturally to a person, that you can't really learn ... would you agree with that or no?"
