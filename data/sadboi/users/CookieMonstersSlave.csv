CitiesSkylines,fcqgfn4,t1_fcpyg7c,1577885525.0,"You can kind of see how 3 highways all meet up at the main industry zone thatvlead to more outside 
Industry. But I think the main thing is transportation. There are very little actual cars in my city, I find it easiest to use buses but this map is a combo of trains/metros and buses. When making the routes I always have an end point and a start point and it follows the same road both ways with a round about at the end that acts as the transportation center (you can use the bus depot if you have mass transit but I find that create more traffic) another thing is the lines will never stay in one area and follow a lot of different roads so that there's basically a bus route on every other road but they all intersect yet they can take you where ever no matter where you are. I got a lot of ideas from a transportation company called SEPTA so if you wanna look up how there bus routes and train lines go I find that helps. One last thing is in my expierence it's a lot better to use one way roads, like have them change direction every way with the occasional two way road that cuts across in a different way. Even if you dont do that than defiantly make the roads connected to industry train stations, harbors, or airports one way with no interceptions close to them. My traffic flucuates from ~75 to ~80 so not the best but deffenitly not bad"
