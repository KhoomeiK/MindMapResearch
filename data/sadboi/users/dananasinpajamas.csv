Anxiety,fq8xdp1,t3_ghev4f,1589178371.0,"I guess I could agree to this. They mean well but they berated me for things I have no control over (people’s reactions, traffic, etc) and to always, ALWAYS be looking out for danger even if it’s not there. Now, I always think bad things happen because it’s my fault and somebody’s always out to get me. You can’t help but get the thoughts all the  time but on the bright side, at least you’re more aware of where all this is coming from and I think that’s a step to self progression."
forhire,fpydw15,t3_gfv8pv,1589002158.0,I have an artist friend who just did a commission for a magic the gathering type of game art and has a similar style to that *but* he doesn’t do digital art and only does it in a traditional medium.
LifeProTips,fptaj8q,t1_fpsvkei,1588887749.0,Gawd I needed this thanks. Sometimes people can be assholes and constantly remind you for your past mistakes for no reason and you always find a need to defend yourself all the time.
castles,fpprmxa,t1_fpok14i,1588807818.0,This actually reminds me of that scene in snow white where the prince was singing to her!

vet,fnx85bt,t1_fnvw306,1587333375.0,Thank you for replying and for the concern. He was doing well yesterday morning but suddenly took a turn for the worst. He died later that evening. We honestly thought he could make it because our vet assured us that our dog would be ok.
Dollhouses,fnx7q3n,t3_g4a1u0,1587333131.0,It looks lovely! Thanks for this!

AskReddit,fn8xs9m,t1_fn8c00a,1586753176.0,"I was at another horrible end of this. She knew my boyfriend was in a relationship with me but she cheated with him anyway for a freaking year. After I broke it off after an exhausting time of crying because of this, my friend asked if she was gonna apologise to me, she just answered “all of that was a trial of God”. She’s extremely Christian. Like Amanda Bynes in Easy A Christian."
Anxiety,fn7f88f,t3_fzm0k0,1586719147.0,All the time!! I’ve had and currently have clients who are micromanagers and constantly checks up on me so I can’t enjoy things without thinking I should be doing work 24/7. My friends have told me to relax but it seems insanely hard to not beat myself with this. It’s as if my head is telling me I’m no good and I don’t deserve rest

macgames,fmfjd1d,t1_flguhdz,1586028469.0,No and I kinda gave up looking for a way. Will probably downgrade to Mojave so I can play again :(
AskReddit,fki2l32,t1_fki1cma,1584210693.0,Well I never thought of it that way. This is the most helpful answer I’ve found yet
AskReddit,fj3ez9d,t1_fj3det7,1582981290.0,i love you
aww,fgu56vu,t1_fgt4sjc,1581113471.0,This sounds like a slip and slide to a very dark joke

LawofAttractionAdvice,fd09uii,t1_fcypzqf,1578115770.0,"If you’re thinking negatively about how he sees you, then maybe it would affect it. How would you treat a bonded best friend confidently without consequence? From my experience, I had been worrying before about losing my new s/o and thinking he doesn’t like me anymore because of the little things (the same way you have been experiencing). It went horrible. The time I let go of this thinking and worrying and then trusting in the universe, I got back with my s/o and we’re happier than ever! Treat him as a companion you see in your life always and don’t overthink the little things. I don’t know the dynamics of your friendship, but you can joke around it and actually reciprocate the energy. The fact that you are talking always means good. If you guys liking each other was established, then what are you worrying about? :)"
LawofAttractionAdvice,fcypwar,t1_fcypffu,1578084666.0,Keep up with the positivity!
LawofAttractionAdvice,fcyp6t3,t3_ejl4k1,1578084279.0,"I think letting go means not worrying too much of the situation and just enjoying the moment freely and being grateful for all the things you have at the moment compared to the time you weren’t as close. Enjoy the moments because you deserve it. The more grateful you are, the more you notice all the positive things that are currently happening. And when you do, everything will come flowing! Trust in the universe completely. Congrats btw! You will get more good times with your crush!"

DungeonsAndDragons,fc7xgs4,t3_ege9fs,1577521221.0,"I think you should try to test-play your character and its possible multiclass options in a simulated world outside your main campaign. That way, you can try out what really feels better for your character both storywise and combat effectivity.

Just my opinion."

The fact that Magus was history meant that he was defeated along the way totally slipped my mind. Thanks for this!"
AskReddit,f92mysk,t1_f92lz5z,1575037276.0,Thank you. I tend to shun myself for all the things I’ve done but this gives me perspective. I’m just afraid that I’ll be branded with this single fuckup and have made me look irresponsible to everyone.
