socialskills,f8c9p3g,t3_dzwaka,1574455689.0,"Hey there buddy! I'm a tech sales coach and my #1 piece of advice is to be interested, rather and interesting. People want to talk about themselves (consciously or subconsciously) and when you ask clarifying questions like, ""that sounds awesome, tell me more about ___"", they will just keep talking and subliminally start liking you. 

So remember:

1. Ask questions. Who, what, when, where, why is a follow-up to any statement in the world. 

Ex: someone says, ""I was in Boston last weekend"", you can say, ""that sounds awesome, what did you do there?"", ""Who were you with""?, ""I've never been, why did you go?""

2. Smile! Evolutionarily, people who smiled at your ancestors were viewed as not a threat because they were ""happy"" to see them. Aka allies. Be an ally. 

3. Talk about your GENUINE interests. Don't try to talk about what you ASSUME the other person wants to talk about. 

I was born with zero interpersonal skills so best of luck and I know you can do it.  Please PM me with any questions."
