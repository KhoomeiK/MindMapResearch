With OCD I have been there. The last time it was strong for me was about a month ago when I lost someone very close. I gave in to my OCD thoughts and behaviors for first few days and then one day I told myself that I must take control of my thoughts. I had to talk myself out of that, if I didn't take control of it, my efforts towards getting better for last few months would be all vain. It wasn't easy but helped.

While we were on another congratulatory topic, I straight asked her whats the big news, are you expecting (because that's what my guess was)..
The reply was ' no I already had a baby, like a couple of weeks back'. I was shocked, surprised, happy all at the same time.

So if person A is seeking reassurance and thinks bad thing X will happen and B says no it will not then A's conviction will further increase.

When you say something negative or distorted about your body/looks to yourself, think and say 10 positive things (and if you try hard you can!!) about yourself. Self affirmation.

Find that one person in your life who you trust and love no matter what and explain what you feel. That's what I did and told them that I am seeking medical help. Enough is enough. They were shocked but supportive as expected.

And then talking to a psychiatrist on phone, just telling them all the symptoms helped me. I constantly had obsessive thoughts and followed rituals to get rid of them but just one phone call magically reduced my obsessions by almost 90%. No kidding. I was shocked myself.

My OCD is not gone completely but I am more aware of it and believing there's someone out there who is willing to help me was a great start.
