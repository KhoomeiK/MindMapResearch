detrans,fqz5c8g,t3_giv0w8,1589760204.0,"Don‚Äôt know any statistics. But what I‚Äôve noticed is that ftmtf people who were sexually assaulted, molested, grew up in a misogynistic environment, have an eating disorder, etc. are usually the ones de transitioning (besides trans people who have to de transition because it‚Äôs not safe). 

Personally I (ftm), have had dysphoria since I was a kid. I still have it (19). I‚Äôve never had any of those things happen in my life ^ listed in the first paragraph. I do have trauma, but it happened a long time after dysphoria was present. 

You have to ask yourself: when did you start having dysphoria? Before, or after trauma had occurred? A major life change? Or did you always experience it since your early memories? 

(P.S. I just stumbled upon the subreddit, so please not hate. Sorry in advance if I was offensive in any way)"
