askatherapist,f5d4uk4,t3_dnkn91,1572148559.0,"It’s okay, i can definitely relate.

People keep telling me that I have a great life and that my sadness is unjustified. My own mother even said that I was depressed because I’m too spoiled. For a long portion of my life I thought this to be true and I battled with depression for a few years before trying to commit suicide twice.
The funny part is that I only sought out help after a panic attack caused by a severe episode of derealization. Lol

But what i learned in therapy is that even if I went through something that others think is “not something that can cause you to feel that down” or something “you can easily overcome”, my feeling are still valid.

Even if my source of sadness was trivial, if it hurts then it hurts and i have to deal with my emotions in a healthy way in order to move on.

We all experience life differently and many factors are at play. For me i think it’s a mixture of the things i went through, my own psych and the way i see life, my environment and the things i have to deal with on a daily basis, and genetics.
Accept your feelings, talk to your therapist about the things that hurt. It’s okay. I was also told by my therapist that i’m too fragile lol but it’s okay we can all overcome things.

copywriting,ewmvbaz,t3_coqb5l,1565561427.0,"I worked as a full-time copywriter for almost a year and then decided that I want a career change (because I already have a bachelor’s in Architecture) so I’m currently interning in an architecture firm and working as a freelance copywriter.

To be honest, freelance copywriting is taking a lot more energy from me than it used to when I worked full time.
Once you do find a client (which is a difficult task to say the least), you will find that they’re quite demanding. I think the market in my country is a bit different but the clients that I have dealt with so far are both demanding and don’t want to pay much because somehow they believe that copywriting is not that big of a deal and that “anyone can do it”

I have also had problems with receiving my payment. At some point I had to call a client every day for a whole month after I have submitted my work to receive my payment.

I mean yes, freelancing sounds more exciting than a full-time job but it also comes with major downsides (and major headaches to be honest). You also have to keep in mind that you, as someone who is only starting out in the field, won’t be having a lot of clients or even good deals on the projects you are given.
You should also expect not having income for some periods of time because simply there isn’t any demand in the time being."

All of these are hardcore truths that we cannot deny by also living life playing video games or just getting high won’t make you any happier. Neither will hurting yourself or other. And killing yourself will just end everything. That’s game over for you and there’s no reset button.
But to be honest it’s great that life is insignificant. Man, I don’t trust myself to make toast how on earth will I cope with the idea that I have to make my life matter? Honestly this shitty thing we call life is just a big joke so instead of being offended by it I advice you to make an effort to understand the irony of it and start laughing along. Understand yourself. Be lost. Learn about the things that make you happy and the things that make you sad and then acknowledge that these are all brain chemicals that somehow dictate your whole life and have a purpose of their own.
Read more philosophy. Nihilism is chill but it’s also boring and obvious. It’s stupid to believe that there is more to life than nothingness but within this nothingness there is you and your consciousness is all that matters in this fucked up experiment so make your experience matter rather than focusing on making your life matter because it most likely won’t. Also, if you think killing someone because you believe you’re not special or you don’t matter in this world then I advice you to read more moral philosophy. You obviously need it."
