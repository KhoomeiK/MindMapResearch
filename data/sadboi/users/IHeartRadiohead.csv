confessions,fpezwf9,t1_fpducfq,1588558585.0,"Had to send my love to you. I was the same kid as you. Affected my whole childhood, probably my life so far actually. My bully was extremely violent and yet only 13, back in 1994. She seemed psychotic. She absolutely terrified me and many others - she had this intense, really unique presence about her, sort of demonic. Her eyes were piercing blue, she was really striking. Her energy was that of someone who had been abused, beaten, punched since birth and never experienced one moment of love, only hate and violence. That’s the energy she gave off. Hard to describe. I haven’t experienced it before. She was extremely quiet, hardly said a word, but she would attack girls like she wanted to kill them. For no reason, too. Just anyone who was happy or nice or smart or looked at her the wrong way. 

I was so innocent and shy and she followed me home after school to the train station one evening and started attacking me in the underground walkway. I didn’t know what the hell was happening. Felt like I was being beaten up by an adult. Smashed a giant rock against my head and had to dragged away by her friend. Traumatised me deeply. I was 13/ am now 39. 

A few years later, she stabbed someone and ended up in prison. 

Last week, after 26 years, I saw her waiting at a bus stop wearing a carers uniform for a old people’s home. She was looking off into space and hadn’t aged much at all. I couldn’t fathom that she would be working in a job like that. I couldn’t see how she could have changed into a person that’s loving and caring, that comforts and washes and chats and brings cups of tea to our loved ones."

The three or four close friends I ever had have all moved on with their lives, moved to big cities and have great careers and lots of babies etc... I just stayed put in the tiny village I’ve lived in since I was born. It makes me feel very safe to be here and I’ve gradually stopped pining for my old friend’s and literally just hang out with my dog. I am mostly absolutely cool with this, but on the odd occasion, it will unexpectedly and suddenly feel deeply painful that I’m on my own like this. That feeling always passes and I carry on, taking my dog for walks in the hills and going to little cafes to drink lattes on my own. Always felt very much like an alien.. I literally flinch if another person tries to make conversation with me, and I am pretty sure that if I ever do end up making a friend in the future, it will be just an acquaintance who is shy and a little similar to me.
