MaladaptiveDreaming,ezvr587,t3_d0baat,1568192222.0,I have three daydreams at the moment and rotate between. In two i feature and am an idealised version of myself so i have a key role.  In the other i don't even feature. In this one there are two main characters. Its in the Victorian period and both are male (i am female). I guess I'm just the birds eye view observer in this one.
MaladaptiveDreaming,ezvqyhn,t3_d1njal,1568191899.0,"This post makes me feel so much better.  I don't ""act"" much beyond the odd hand gesture ahs facial expression but I voice the characters.  My daydreams often get very focused on key scenes in the storyline and i will completely zoom in on those scenes and act them out. I'll even do the accents that the characters have.  It makes me feel so much better to know other people do similar."
bipolar2,eyql5uc,t3_cy22v7,1567346625.0,"This is really interesting how you've written the feelings, impact and frequency. I'm diagnosed with clinical depression but I have a suspicion I'm somewhere on the bipolar spectrum due to a couple of times a year having these periods of unusual positivity, racing thoughts, struggling to focus at work or in life and making plans that i then pull out of because it all ends in a sudden crash into depression. I really hope you get to see a therapist where you can say everything that you need to and writing it down is a fantastic idea.  As a rambler myself i know how hard it is to focus in a therapy appt and say what you wanted to say.  If your problems are episodic and cycling that's also tricky - you forget how you felt when you were struggling and maybe can't even believe you ever felt that way. You are right to press for a diagnosis on this if that's what will help you - I hope it all goes well and you have a positive experience and get some answers ‚ù§"
MaladaptiveDreaming,eynpabr,t3_cxugvu,1567255234.0,"They probably think about things like their worries, what happened that day, oh i must remember to do this tomorrow. Or maybe they get absorbed into what they're watching on tv or music or a book.  Either way they sound odd to me, these ""normal people"" üòÅ"
depressed,eydmfnz,t1_eydhrsb,1567021194.0,"Thank you so much for your reply - I really appreciate it. I did ""low intensity cbt"" therapy initially and didn't find it helped me with the depression. I found it really obvious. My depression is often not situational. I can plummet fast and for no obvious reason.  I struggled applying the low level cbt to that.

I had the first counselling for depression session last night and felt terrible afterwards.  But not in a therapeutic (confronting my demons) type way.  Ive had counselling for anxiety years and years ago and i sometimes emerged from that feeling upset because we had dealt with painful fears. Which is good. Last night was different.  The therapist managed to upset me about 5 times.  She managed (accidentally I'm sure) to make me feel melodramatic, a drain on my friends and overly needy.  I suspect she would be mortified if she knew i came home feeling deeply upset but I didn't feel understood at all and felt like we were on completely different wavelengths. I really don't want to see her again.  I felt alright when i went in too. The mental health team will let me try counselling again with a different counsellor if i want. 

I'll have a think...I do think a lot of mine comes from past trauma."
depression,exyv5zf,t3_cuqta6,1566657347.0,"Not for as long as 5 hours but I've noticed in an evening, once the day is over and I've eaten etc, i end up going to bed and just lying there in the dark thinking my depressive thoughts.  Sometimes I dissociate (I often dissociate into a fantasy life which I think is a coping mechanism.)  But yeah most nights I do this when I'm going through one of my depressive periods."
MaladaptiveDreaming,exiprlz,t3_cr0mcm,1566333156.0,"I can relate to so much of this - especially 2, 3 and 6. ü§ó"
MaladaptiveDreaming,exipe16,t3_craelb,1566332938.0,"This. My characters are based on celebrities that I like. My favourite celebrity appears in all of my daydreams (at the moment i have a few that i alternate between - including one where we are on the run, one that's set back in the 1800s and one where it's like an alternate life and we are married with a circle of friends based on either real life friends or other celebrities.)  These celebrities are not famous in my daydreams, i just use their appearance and modify their personalities üòÇ"
MaladaptiveDreaming,exio74r,t3_cs5wte,1566332254.0,"I mentioned it to a therapist (who I was seeing for a different problem) and she didn't seem to know what to say. She just kind of smiled as if to say ""oh how cute"". I think the word ""daydreaming"" does not help because it sounds so lovely and nice.  

I mentioned it to a close friend once when she said she loves to daydream.  But her definition of daydreaming and mine are not the same.  She likes to sit and drift off and think nice thoughts a lot.  I can spend hours acting out scenarios involving different characters (who i actually voice) and do this every day so that i am going to bed too late or getting up too late in the morning. I didn't tell her this.  Once she described her daydreaming I just lied and pretended I did the same because I was scared of the reaction.  

I have one friend who i think has mdd too. She has described her elaborate, convoluted daydreams to me and the sheer amount of time she spends on them.  She doesn't voice characters or act out the parts but she is the only friend i have who actually understands it. 

The odd thing is that up until about 3 years ago i didn't realise that daydreaming like this was not ""normal"". I thought everybody did it."
MaladaptiveDreaming,exfkgib,t3_cs4s1e,1566242529.0,"This is relatable to me. I have a couple of daydreams going on at the moment which are mainly centred on romance. I play and replay different scenes from these daydreams multiple times, sometimes I make a new scene - just whatever feels right in that moment. One daydream is a romance with a celebrity and another is a completely made up character in a fictional version of my life."
depression,exfiygf,t3_csksd0,1566241585.0,"Good luck and well done. I had counselling for anxiety years ago and am starting counselling for depression next week. If it's counselling you're having, it will most likely be a conversation that's at your pace but skilfully steered by the professional who knows what they are doing. I found it very helpful for anxiety at letting me see what was driving my thoughts. And it's nothing to be scared of. I'm totally going to take notes in when I go for the depression counselling though because I always forget things."
depression,exemzh6,t1_exelkj1,1566220312.0,One of my problems has been that when I've seen therapists I've come across as fine because I'm high functioning.  I've started keeping a diary now so that they can see how often i feel so low.
depression,exemw8k,t1_exekpy1,1566220243.0,I don't even know who i am any more ... am i the depressed person or the facade that's pretending to be ok? Its a full time job - trying to look capable of holding down a full time job
