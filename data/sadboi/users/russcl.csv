If you keep your crosshair at head level at all times, your headshot percentage is going to shoot up and you‚Äôll be winning aim duels time and time again. Around corners one of the best ways to peek is a jiggle peek, where you strafe left quickly then back right, as to trigger somebody‚Äôs shot if they‚Äôre watching.

Yoda even says ‚ÄúAn army for us, created by the enemy‚Äù (or something along those lines). The reason why they accepted it was because they didn‚Äôt have enough numbers to respond on the Battle of Geonosis, and the clones were ready to depart. Not just because they were ready, but because the Council acknowledged that they would lose the support of the people. As the war progressed, they had to continue to use the clones because if they were to tell the public ‚Äúour enemy made our army‚Äù nobody would trust in the Jedi and especially the clones. It was just kinda like ‚Äúwe had to use them at the start and we couldn‚Äôt just stop in the middle‚Äù."

In times of distress like break ups, I recommend meditating (more if you already do so), it helps teach you to control how you feel."
