What we need is for people to not forget the lessons learned here and push for lasting, sustainable change to how we fund, staff and train within healthcare. 

We need safe nurse:patient ratios. We need to value our inexperienced staff, train them well and support them. Our long term care and skilled nursing facilities that take care of our most vulnerable need more staff, better access to supplies. There’s a culture of sacrifice in healthcare, we need to adjust how we treat our residents, our staff. 

We need systems that work as systems and not as silos (not competing for the same supplies, sharing of resources and information). Right now that psych nurse  or LTC nurse that you look down on for being less skilled may be your coworker tomorrow. We have close ranks, take care of our own.

I had a bad ankle sprain years ago (6 weeks non-weight bearing)- and I did extensive physio and then swam, and then slowly started doing more high impact things as I got clearance. 

It took a full year before I wasn’t aware of my ankle every single time I took a step. Sprains can be nasty- is advise that if you have the resources have it assessed.  When I finally got in to be seen, my ankle was so poorly supported I could have broken it just attempting to walk."

rollerderby,fehimsi,t3_ep734a,1579117305.0,"I did a major upgrade my rookie year (first season playing games) from R3s to skates with Mag Avenger plates. I found that my edge work was more crisp,  my skates were responsive and I got way more power and speed. 

Take this with a grain of salt because at the same time my skills were exponentially improving because I was thrown in with some super talented skaters and I worked my ass off to try to keep up."
Anxiety,feehbla,t3_eonw76,1579033753.0,I used to ask my friends if they cared about a full answer to the question. Not to be rude but because I couldn’t stop once I started full on explaining something I was passionate about.

EOOD,fds526o,t3_emskq0,1578694524.0,"In some of the hardest times of my life, running was that place where my brain quieted. It was a beautiful break from ongoing nasty monologue that is my anxiety and depression. 

I also found that if I’m feeling panicky and I lace up my shoes and go for a run, the deliberate spike in my heart rate cancels out my panic attacks."
puppy101,fdqj33j,t3_emqfe1,1578667907.0,Our dog ate his slow feeder bowl when he was a pup. Just a word of caution.
puppy101,fdq074t,t3_emoaps,1578648367.0,"We have a one year old and it took forever for our cat to adjust. We gated off half the house and would let the cat choose when he felt comfortable to interact. 

Ultimately we used the “leave it” command to tell the little guy to give the cat some space. It took about 6 months but now they mostly coexist peacefully. Cats are stubborn animals and it takes a while for them to adjust."

puppy101,fdjg24y,t3_elhmf4,1578469252.0,"So, we adopted a shelter doggie and while he was super duper friendly he was slow to bond. Now we know he loves us because:

1. He prefers our company at the dog park- he will play with the other doggies, but will regularly “check-in” and will come find us if we walk away

2. Bringing his high value treats to chew with us. 

3. Snoozing upside down with all feet in the ai

4. We’ll catch him casually admiring, long gazes while he curls at our feet. 

Remember that similar to human babies, sometimes the bond isn’t instantaneous, you have to build a relationship. Be kind and consistent."
puppy101,fdj34gs,t3_elmcjn,1578457186.0,Ours hit at about 8 months and he’s starting to show signs of slowing at 14 months. We get these little glimmers of what an amazing adult he will be.

Doing a Barre class tomorrow morning as my LISS and then back to the gym on Monday for the real beginning of the program."
puppy101,fc2wox1,t3_efnnn2,1577376040.0,"My not so little one year old got all the extra treats from grandma and grandpa, pushed boundaries with his cousin and got bit. Oh and threw up twice on my parents floor. 

It’s been an eventful holiday.... he’s staying home for Boxing Day with my partner and having a quiet day in."
puppy101,fb9pepa,t3_ec767w,1576645223.0,"My pup Arrived in our life at 4 months and was a fully teething land shark terror. The only thing that worked for him was for the toys to go away and for me to remove myself froM the room. 

If there was no biting, games and attention continued. If he started biting, instant boredom."
