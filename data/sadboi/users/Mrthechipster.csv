CampOhio,fr3bohp,t1_fr312l0,1589853960.0,"My friend and I had severely underguessed how far we had gone, and thought we only had 3 miles left when we had actually just reached the halfway point and had pushed ourselves too hard. We ended up breaking every backpacking rule and took a chance following a service road that appeared to lead back to the trailhead in half of the distance of the actual trail, according to our map. Turned out it was less of a road and more of a giant dry creekbed. I doubt even a horse or Jeep could’ve made it up the hill and the “road”. The 2nd most strenuous uphill portion I’ve ever been on before (number 1 goes to the return hike of hemmed in hollow in AR) and we didn’t even see the cars till the very last minute when we burst through the underbrush. It was a wild experience and I’ll remember it fondly"
CampOhio,fr300qe,t3_gd0ynu,1589847217.0,"The spiders on this trail are absurd. Probs the most heavily infested hike I’ve done. Did it after a massive storm a few years ago, big enough that there were large trees down all over the trail and the river crossing points where knee deep at their lowest, and the spiders were still thick as hell. Have great memories of that hike overall but I always like to give people a heads up. 

Oh also the trailhead is an old Irish cemetery and is creepy as hell to pull up on at 11pm"
