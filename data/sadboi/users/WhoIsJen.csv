For me the meds has helped with impulsivity but not really for the emotions. I did get a good trick of breathing in on a 4 count, holding for 4, then breathing out for 8. Problem is it can be obvious and doesn't always work. I have to start as soon as I feel emotional, once I get the tears started it's hard to stop.

adhdwomen,fn0c3j2,t3_fyj20h,1586539211.0,"Yes, I am divorced but mine was in a spectacular blow-up when I found out he was cheating on me.

But I had very similar experiences. This all happened before I was diagnosed so I was drowning trying to keep up with everything. 

What was drove me nuts for the 15 years we were married are similar to what you experience. If I didn't do everything, nothing would happen. I realized over time that it was because he always had someone to take care of him, therefore someone was always doing the work and he got away with it. He swore that wasn't the case because he considered himself a feminist but when I looked back I could see a direct line where he moved from his mom's house, got a girlfriend and over the years rarely went without a woman taking care of him. When I tried to talk about keeping the house clean, managing the money, all if it he would shrug and say he didn't care if the dishes piled up. If they bothered me, I should do them. It was incredibly manipulative because he knew I would give in eventually after days worth of dished piled up. He never cleaned the house because he knew I'd eventually break and do it. If the bills didn't get paid he'd get mad but never enough to take over the finances. When we split up he sent me email asking how does he get car insurance because I'd kicked him off our policy. Imagine not being able to Google that at a minimum. 

It never changed. I wish I could say I was able to get him to engage but I never was able to. All I know is that I'll never be with another man who is incapable of taking care of himself and his home. 

Divorce sucks. It's brutal for everyone. I always tell my friends to do everything in their power to save their marriage because it is awful. Mine was a no-brainer but not everyone has that clear of a line that was crossed. I think you have to ask yourself is it worth losing your marriage. I can't answer that for you."

When I got to college all of my structures went away and I did terrible even though I loved most of my classes. The tests and research papers killed me but I understood everything. I graduated but only after I had to take two make-up classes because I flunked two my last semester. Procrastination and not testing well really hurt me.

I went back in my mid-20s and got a second degree and made Dean’s list. I was working several jobs to pay for it and looking back that structure really helped me. I would only have specific times I could get stuff done so I was in a constant state of pressure but I loved the subjects so it was easy for me to get in the zone and crank out a paper.

adhdwomen,feu0muc,t3_eqkvvf,1579381961.0,"TL;DR: Adulting is hard work. I've read that ADHD gets ""worse"" as an adult because we are expected to take on more and more responsibilities that our executive functions aren't able to deal with. 

The long version:

I'm 50 and it took me a long time to figure out it's OK to not do everything on my to-do list right away. Some things can wait. I also get home from work and do as little as possible. I need to recharge. I'm fine with sitting on the couch watching TV because it takes so much energy for me to function as a grown-up.

I didn't get diagnosed until 2ish years ago and most of what I was doing to survive was coping mechanisms I'd built even though I didn't know why I needed them. My counselor keeps telling me I'm very self-aware but that has come at a high cost, lost jobs and a divorce earned me that wisdom.

As far as work, that is still a really hard one for me. The jobs I've done well at are ones where I am actively doing something, not just thinking about what to do. For example, I look for the keywords ""strategy"" and ""program creation"" in a job description and I know right away I'd be doomed. I have no idea how to go about starting either of those and they pretty much end in a PowerPoint that may or may not lead to actually taking action. I hate that. I'd rather be the person who takes that PowerPoint and makes it happen.

Right now I'm in a strategy and program creation job and I'm about to lose it. It's been a good experience because it crystallized for me what my weaknesses are and I'm much more careful about jobs I'm applying for now.

This is the time for you to really dig in and find the tools that work for you in order to manage your life. It doesn't get easier as you get older. I wish I had better news on that one.

I am in therapy with a psychiatrist for my meds and a counselor for my working on my ADHD functioning. That has been a huge help. I ended up calling a crisis line a couple months ago when I had an overwhelming day and talked to someone who was like a sweet grandmother. It was a sanity saver and I have access to that again if I need it.

I am in the US and will file for unemployment. Unfortunately where I live is very expensive, Seattle, so it won't cover even my rent. I have savings and can be fine for 6 months on that supplementing but I hate burning through cash just to get by. It's why I have saved though so at least I was smart.

I will be filing a request for accommodation at work. It won't save me in my current role but I'm hopeful it will prevent me from being outright fired. We'll see. It should offer some protection but I don't know what. I can get a job coach, my company is really progressive, which would help me in a transition to a new role if I can find someone willing to take a chance on me.

I have 2 cats and they have been the best comfort. They are hilarious, understanding and very loving. They know when I'm upset and give me proper attention.

I know I am in the wrong career path and need to get out but I'm 50 and going back to school and racking up debt just isn't smart right now. I need to be focused on saving for retirement. I can do some certifications but even those are crazy expensive.

I also chased a guy, in my car, through a parking garage that had clipped a car, gotten out to see the damage to the other car, then got in his car and drove away. Not on my watch!  I made him leave his phone number on the car he damaged, even provided the paper and pen.

I followed and harassed a guy who threw his cigarette butt on the ground in full view of an ash tray. 

I have moved across the country on a whim. Bought a trip to South Africa on a whim. Volunteered for all kinds of shit without thinking about the commitment I just made.

ADHD,fbmwzuc,t3_ee0eiu,1576989882.0,"TL;DR: Structure and figure out when you are at your highest functioning and study then.

Decide exactly what you need to get done that session. Break down what you have to do/read/whatever into manageable time blocks. Go by time, not by specific milestones. For example, study for 45 minutes then take a break, unless you are focused, and do something else for 5-10 minutes, then come back! This might mean you take longer than you thought but you will likely retain more.

I should say I wasn't diagnosed until I was 49 so I muscled my way though 2 college degrees, one of them just barely.  The second I did much better because I loved most of my classes and was also working so my study time was precious and I had to be organized. Time pressure FTW!

I've always found it incredibly difficult to study for something I don't find interesting. I'm many years out of school but have done a bunch of personal and professional skill certifications in the last couple years so I've needed to re-learn how to study.

Today I decided I needed a new challenge and am going to work on a professional certification over the holiday. What's going to be hard is I won't be doing any classroom time, which is where I learn best. To get through it, I created a daily schedule of topics I need to cover. When I start for the day, I'm going to break it down into small chunks. 

I've come to understand that I'm able to concentrate starting an hour after I take my Concerta and for about 5 hours total, then I'm out of gas, so I will schedule my study time based on that. 

Studying can be brutal with ADHD. Best of luck to you, I hope you found something helpful in my rambling."

ADHD,fawlv2o,t3_eanj3u,1576372865.0,"I was just diagnosed last year with ADHD at 49 and the more I learn about it and co-morbid disorders the more makes sense to me.

I haven't been tested for dyscalculia but I'm sure I have it. 

I refuse to get my MBA simply because of statistics. I won't go back to school for a CS degree because of all the math. I had As in all of my classes in high school but I almost didn't graduate because I was failing algebra. I wanted to be a veterinarian but  my math was so bad I didn't bother even taking chemistry. I never would have made it through vet school. 

I have so many stories and they are all pretty painful. My SATs were a disaster even thought I am a smart person in a lot of areas. 

I traveled across the country right out of college to work at a national park. When I got there they put me to work in the office and handed me a piece of paper with rows and rows and columns and columns of numbers and asked me to add them all up for some reason. I couldn't do it. No matter how many times I did it, I got a different number. I was moved into the housekeeping department after only a couple days.

It's been paralyzing. This past year I took a class on map and compass navigation. I failed the final quiz because I couldn't figure out how to plot a point along the longitude between two points on the map. Which was the higher number? I had no idea. It was awful. I'd mentioned to the teacher before class that I had some problems with numbers and she walked through the failed quiz with me afterwards. I could talk through it but not plot the points. I cried in the car when I got done. 

I've missed out on so much between my ADHD and this. I wasn't tested for any of it because I did well in other classes as long as they were interactive. I could also talk and write my way through any essay test so I did all liberal arts courses.

It is freeing to realize my brain doesn't work like 90% of the population but also very sad. I wish I'd known when I was in elementary school. I can't help but wonder how my life would be different if I had."

Not everyone uses this sub for the same reason. Of course that is fine. I'm not trying to tell someone how they should behave, just pointing out many of us can't get through a long post. You do you.

Brand new to a job, in a meeting with a bunch of important people including partners and somehow a person mentioned needing a cape for a product, meaning a part, not the superhero. Of course I blurt out “No cape!” which came from Edna in The Incredibles. Everyone stops and looks at me and only one person out of 10 got it. Thankfully he rescued me.

Second was at the same job, several years later. A group of serious VPs came in the front door, with my manager, while I was waiting in front of the elevators for a worker so we could go to lunch. VPs are standing there and of course I have to make small-talk. “Did you enjoy lunch?” “Nice weather,” Blah Blah.

1. Your family history is key so go with the list of who has it.
2. Give very specific examples: Instead of saying you procrastinate, talk about specific times it has negatively affected you. Instead of saying you lose track of time, give more specific examples. Make sense?
3. Talk about how these symptoms have affected your life and knowing whether you have ADHD will allow you to get treatment to improve those symptoms and improve your life.

It's also good you recognize you might not actually have ADHD because it's always possible your symptoms are unrelated or persistent enough to warrant the diagnosis.

I am working my way out of a severe depressive episode. I'm not all the way clear yet but feeling a little better. I am on Latuda to get me over the hump because it is not clearing on it's own. 

My depression affects me like this:

* My face goes slack. Like it isn't physically possible to smile.
* I feel like there is a weighted blanket on me and I sink into the couch, barely able to get up for basic self care.  Its hard to even lift my arm to get to the TV remote. 
* My apartment becomes a mess because its too hard to clean or even pick up things I drop on the floor.
* The cat litter doesn't get cleaned but the cats do get fed.
* I literally do not care about anything but my cats. I swear having pets to care for has kept me out of the hospital several times over the years. Especially during my divorce. If I wasn't worried about who would take care of them, I probably would have checked myself in after my marriage ended. 1 dog and 4 cats kept me grounded.
* I have one volunteer commitment I go to every Sunday afternoon that forces me to leave my apartment. I know if I start calling in to cancel then I'm paralyzed and need deep help so I force myself to go. I don't always shower but I do show up. One person there knows my diagnosis so she makes sure I'm OK and if I cancel, she calls me to make sure I really do have a cold and not frozen to the couch.
* I eat like shit when I eat. I'm vegan and become a junk food vegan when I'm depressed because cooking real food is too hard. 
* I force myself to go into the office instead of work at home because if I don't, I'm going to get worse.  Isolation is the absolute worst thing I can do but it is incredibly hard to do all the things that have to be done to go into the office.
