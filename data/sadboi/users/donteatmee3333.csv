She’s a strong woman and she is so brave for speaking out and telling the truth.This day and age it’s understandable for a woman to speak out because you literally have to be afraid of your safety."
GenderCritical,fr60vrd,t1_fr608we,1589917955.0,Yeah believe me I went to this type of school myself. We got the same minimal sex education and “abortion bad” lessons. I do plan on explaining things to them myself but the thought of having to put my future children through both sides of this bullshit is exhausting.

GenderCritical,fr5ykti,t3_gmt9tp,1589916831.0,I am not religious anymore but this kind of stuff makes me strongly consider putting my future children in private school.
