IMO, that derives from the seeking and glorification of power. Power is equated to security and influence, and, in turn, self-preservation and the protection of those we care about. The ability to be productive makes a person useful to others in a family, a village, and a wider society, across cultures. The male role seems dominated by the attainment and preservation of power, and thus, safety."

She's probably going to need some help accepting this transition. The counseling suggestion is a good one. No matter what happens, a key piece will be demonstrating to your children that people can disagree completely about their spiritual beliefs and still love and respect each other, always mindful of what they share in common.
