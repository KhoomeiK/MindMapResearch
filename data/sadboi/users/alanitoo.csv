When it begins to interfere with work, your relationships. Ask yourself. Is this behavior new? Is it being done in moderation? Can I stick to a schedule.

I'm going to work. Then for one hour. I will do x. For another. y. Finally z. I am going to bed at midnight but will get this number of hours of sleep.

If you can use logic, speak in a calm tone about your interests you are okay.

For depression. Everyone is sad. Everyone has those days, where you see reminders of things that hurt you. Some thing you have lost. Some dream you never reached. A mountain you never climbed.

Depression for me is Sleeping for hours. Not showering for days. That was depression. No self-care. I didn't care if I brushed my teeth. If my apartment had bags of garbage everywhere.

It's like receiving a life sentence. But my meds have slowed down my thinking. I feel more stable than I did even before I was on adderall. I am more confident. Less anxious around people. Just knowing what I have is better than living a private hell."
bipolar,ezs4naj,t3_d21a33,1568082749.0,Sounds like mania however was the class important? Was it one you could miss with no worries? I once skipped my class to go bargain shoe shopping at Payless. This was because I was dreading this class and really needed to study.

I was diagnosed when I was 30 so your statement applies to me. I absolutely hate that it took a manic episode to be diagnosed.

And to answer your question. It does get better. I was in denial for months after my diagnosis. But medication, seeing a psychiatrist, seeing a therapist and support groups did wonders. It's hard but it gets better."

What are you raising your voice about? I would be irritated as hell if someone just dismissed my concerns because of my disorder.

Are your concerns valid?"

I hope everything works out for you and I know you are strong enough to pull through this. A lot of people can't make it through an interview and you did. Stay strong."

> Nothing I did in my free will led to me being bipolar.

I wanted to apologize for this comparison. You are correct that nothing you did in your own free will led to you being bipolar.

Although I still stand by not using your disorder as an excuse, I believe that you are correct that everyone deserves the dignity of a response to an apology.

When I reached out to some people, I did not receive a response at times for several days and I also felt angry but also relieved because at least they were not sending me a 'mean' response.

I respect your opinion and again, I apologize at the comparison between mania and driving while drunk. 

Good luck with your recovery."

bipolar,eywizf6,t3_cz7gka,1567530597.0,">I could’ve been healthy.

Going to have to disagree with you on this. I grew up with a somewhat decent family. My mom provided for us. Cooked us nice meals. Yea we were poor but my dad was always working to provide for his family. We never wanted for a roof over our head, a warm meal or clean clothes. 

And yet all it took was being stressed out at my job and my partner taking a trip overseas for me to immediately lose it. If it's in your genes, honestly, you can have the best family in the world but all it takes is something stressful to trigger a manic/depressive episode. 

Do you honestly think no middle class people with a modern family-like life, have depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder?"
bipolar,eywirmu,t3_cz7ii1,1567530453.0,"I stood in front of a pharmacy for hours, 'solving' all the world's problems by talking to myself.

I stood in front of a yard, playing in the dirt until some cops drove up and took me to the hospital. It was crazy. I ran for hours in the middle of the night before I was hospitalized."

Are you in the US by any chance? I am also uninsured and was able to see a Psychiatrist. Have you tried applying for Medicaid? Is there anyone that will do sliding scale? I was able to see my therapist for under $30 per session. 

>I'm stuck in this spot until January when I can apply for open enrollment.

Have you tried applying now to see if you qualify for medicaid?

I had to jump through so many hoops to see my Psychiatrist but please do not give up. See if there is a program for low income people. 

>Ability 10mg/day will cost me $628 a month with no insurance.

Is there a generic version of this? Can you possibly take another medication that is cheaper? I am on Oxcarbazepine and my medication was less than $50.

Have you asked about a discount? I know there are lots of discount plans for uninsured people. Walmart sells some medication for less than $10.

I know it can get discouraging. But please do not give up the fight. I once got into an argument with a receptionist who said the Psychiatrist could not see me, and I calmly said, "" I am reaching out for help, will you or will you not help me"". Remembering it now, I realize I was manic but this was the only way I could get an appointment.

Good luck with your journey and your recovery."
