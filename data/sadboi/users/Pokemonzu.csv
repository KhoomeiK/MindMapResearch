2. I’m an atheist but I think religion is ok (televangelist scams etc. aren’t but those would go away without the profit motive). You could check out r/RadicalChristianity for example, they’re pretty cool.

3. The capitalist police serve the interests of the capitalist class, so police in a socialist society would serve the working class. So instead of punishing homeless people and poor people they’d go after businesses mistreating workers (in the transition to socialism). Maybe they could actually help people in need instead of punishing them. Most crime is caused by poverty so eliminating poverty would solve crime better than policing. A lot of conflicts between people would also be better solved by social workers than a cop with a gun. Hopefully the police could be abolished, tho most of this is speculation and it might be difficult in the early stages of socialism.

4. I support sex workers under capitalism, but when poverty goes down so does sex work, so a lot of them do it out of desperation. And ofc theres a lot of trafficking/exploitation. In a socialist society people wouldn’t need to sell themselves to survive, in a communist one money wouldn’t exist so people would only make porn of their own free will.

5. Idk wasn’t Marx a philosopher lol"

So a dictatorship of the proletariat (which gives workers and not capitalists democratic control over society) is necessary to prevent the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie from coming back.

Marx talked about a ""lower stage"" and ""higher stage"" of socialism/communism (he used the two terms interchangeably), which later were called socialism and communism. And he did describe the later stage (communism) as a classless, stateless, society, ""from each according to their ability and to each according to their need.""
