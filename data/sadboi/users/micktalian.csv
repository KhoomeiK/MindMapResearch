In one context, nihilism is the transition away from an objective truth and inherent meaning, and is placed in a more negative framing, and in another context he described it as an incomplete process by which individuals will come to the realization that truth are meaning are inherently derived from social conditions are thus are malleable. In the latter context, he seems to infer that nihilism will result in a society which is more aware of an in control of itself and it's perceptions of meaning and truth.

The point he seems to make is those regulations must be in line with already established traditional limits to freedoms. Things such as time and place restrictions on certain expressions of speech and ensuring that health policy, which he points to as a state power, stay in the states hands.

""Attorney General William P. Barr recently announced a new Justice Department policy to prevent “overreach” by governors and other local authorities seeking to contain the coronavirus pandemic. The department, he wrote in a memo to U.S. attorneys across the country, will “monitor state and local policies and, if necessary, take action to correct them.” Earlier, on Fox News, Barr expressed his own views on the matter: “I think we have to allow people to adapt more than we have, and not just tell people to go home and hide under their bed.

.....On Saturday, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals similarly held that an order prohibiting mass gatherings in Kentucky could not be applied to a church service that adhered to social-distancing guidelines.

*This is an extremely important point*
Aggressive interventions by the federal government and courts in states’ efforts to manage the pandemic are a dangerous but predictable development in these polarized times. While most civil liberties lawsuits against state stay-at-home orders have failed, there are sure to be more in the coming months. And when states reissue those orders to contain local outbreaks and the predicted second wave of contagion in the fall, courts will again be called on to evaluate the age-old conflict between civil liberties and public safety.

There are powerful reasons, however, for courts to stay out of emergency public health matters. Chief among them is a little-understood asymmetry in the way our judicial system responds to complaints about government misbehavior. When the government issues orders that restrict liberties, our constitutional tradition allows affected people to ask judges to block those orders. But when the government fails to issue orders, when it underreaches rather than overreaches, citizens have no right to judicial review. Courts do not recognize a constitutional right to health or safety; they do not allow people to sue for orders compelling the government to act.

Sure, in theory, qualified immunity sounds like a good idea but if there is no effective way to hold police accountable for their excessive or illegal actions then people will lose any sense of respect for the police and the laws that those police enforce. Why do you think the term ""ACAB"" (All Cops Are Bastards) exists? Police are literally able to beat you to a bloody pulp, if not out right kill you, and there will most likely be those police will still be walking around with a badge and a gun, maybe after a few week paid vacation. This is what I mean by a ""Critical"" approach. A person must examine the actualities of how a law is being applied and enforced, not just the theory behind it. A lot of things sound great in theory and its really hard to argue against certain philosophical principles being applied but the reality of the matter should be far more important than theory. We could back and forth about hypotheticals all day but the fact of the matter is police are maiming and killing people who are innocent and those police are getting away with it. Even if the qualified immunity doctrine is going to stay on the books because there genuinely aren't any better methodologies, then it seriously needs to be overhauled. We can't have police investigating police, that just doesn't work, and we can't keep letting police murder innocent people and get away with it."

minipainting,fptenjm,t1_fptef1r,1588889862.0,I accidentally used Marlin Volumetric instead of regular Marlin in my slicer and somehow that turned off retraction. With that setting back on the hexagons will actually look good and not all melted together.
3Dprinting,fpspu4o,t1_fpsm3gw,1588877573.0,"I think they have a new model coming out soon. And I'm thinking about sort of piece making one together. Try to get better steppers, better hotend, better everything strat from the start."
3Dprinting,fps5wik,t1_fps4wt1,1588867996.0,"Honestly, I'm kinda regretting get this printer over something like an ender 3. The reason I'm still happy with it is the auto leveling and touch screen, neither of which are particularly great though."
3Dprinting,fprpnur,t1_fprkvu1,1588859559.0,"All good. To be honest, I would probably get better/more consistent results with a smaller nozzle but stupid Monoprice just *HAS* to make everything proprietary. It's not a MK8, it's not a v6 nozzle, it's its own thing that's about 1mm shorter than a standard v6."

3Dprinting,fpoo1ag,t1_fpongpp,1588787724.0,"I used a power drill to respool it and so far its been great. But yeah, those first few prints went terribly with how loose the spool was wound. My lead line ended up about 8 layers deep and I went out of my way to try to keep a good grip on everything. The company is somewhat local to me so I may just literally call them and say that I love their filament, I just wish they would either just sell it on a master spool or make sure its wound more tightly"
