science,fpu1oa6,t3_g7t0j9,1588902766.0,"Good evening. As a 60-year-old male that has lived/suffered/survived with depression as long as I can remember, but not knowing want was ""wrong"" with me until a breakdown in front of my primary physician when he asked me the simple question. ""How are you doing other than physically?"" No one had ever asked me that. I always have hidden it when my mind made me cry, not move and/or have ""the shakes"", as my kids called.  I have not told anyone except my wife and children. The view that depression is a weakness in males is widespread and in some cases discriminatory. I have been told by employers that people with depression cannot be good employees, cannot be trusted and are weak. If they only knew that the Steel Fabrication plant is being managed by a man that struggles with depression and suicidal thought. I am sure I would be terminated for ""just cause"". Feel free to ask me anything or give me your thoughts."

depression,f6njk89,t3_drzf8r,1572992907.0,My therapist has told me I have persistent depression disorder.  Constant depression with peaks and valleys.  She is honest and straightforward about things. I will never be depression free and will survive with it.

depression,f1acbf3,t3_d8dg5x,1569290292.0,"You have described high functioning depression to a ""T"". I was diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago after a life time of wondering what was wrong with me. It is hard to put on the face every day...a lot of days I just come home and crash, BUT there are good days...just enough to keep me pushing. It was a relief for me to find a doctor that listened to me. It was hard hearing you have ""Depression with fear"" and the big one was when therapist updated it to ""Depression and passive suicidal""...BUT it does get better so hang in there you know what is going on and can work on it. I hope you are younger than me when I found help at 55."

depression,ez9e11g,t1_ez941ty,1567780042.0,"Most people act like it is contagious like cold. LOL. My employer looks at it as a weakness.  They have no clue that I live with depression, I manage  a steel fabrication plant, and one of the owners has actually made the comment,after someone quite,  ""it was for the best people like her cannot be good employees or trusted because she has depression "". I just stood there. I will never forget it, but no witnesses."
depression,ez6t5qy,t3_d01jay,1567714946.0,"It is hard for me to openly discuss the darkness I feel sometimes.  I always fear, part of depression, that I may say something to another person with issues and push a trigger"
depression,eyw6iu7,t3_cz4xf4,1567522132.0,"Hang in there.  I only check reddit so often. There are places to get help not just here. 
I know it is hard to see the light sometimes, but never give in to the darkness.  
I am 60 yo and have been soooooo close to the dark but pulled back each tome.

You are worth pulling back even if you have doubts you are. If it gets bad...go to the ER and ask for help. Been there done that."

I do not think I could do it in away that someone would feel guilty.  Do not want to hurt others, but if I was to have heart attack I am not sure I would fight. Hell 60 yo and high blood pressure...lol"

depression,evmbjf2,t1_evl9f0m,1564605802.0,You are lucky.  My insurance does not have mental health benefits.  They consider it a weakness and believe going to church and prayer cures all. So I have double whammy.  Depression (weakness in their eyes) and am a non-believer. So I have to put on two good acts.
depression,evg7und,t1_evb5mg1,1564506925.0,It was not really a decision.  1st was a surprise but gave me so much joy and love from the first second.
depression,evg7hrx,t1_evcfvic,1564506794.0,"Not taking any way...lol. Good question.  My 1st daughter was a surprise and not planned. The moment I saw her dark haired head appear and got to hold her I never felt so much joy. Raising her and my other children was the greatest fun I have had and the least depressed time of my life. The depression started to return as they got older. Now that they have moved onto their own life, as they should, the empty space has returned."

depression,evb2ao8,t3_cj1d4o,1564363847.0,I do not feel envies of them. I feel joy for them and am happy they do not. I have been fighting for as long as I can remember with 1st attempt of suicide at 12. My wife and I have raised 4 great kids that have good lives. I worry everyday that they may have this illness and my biggest fear is that none of them have it.
