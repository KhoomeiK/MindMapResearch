loseit,fegtvgd,t1_fegsn8t,1579102416.0,"I'm glad it has helped! The benefits will only become more noticeable with time. It's been a lifesaver for me. Adjusting can take time. Be patient with yourself, meal plan, and journal. You've got this."
loseit,fegrzok,t3_ep38av,1579101169.0,"I started taking Lexapro about 6 months ago and definitely gained weight on it. It has helped my depression loads, though. The only thing I can suggest is journaling your food intake and finding a new way to distract yourself when you want to binge. I used to binge at night but now I don't eat after 6pm."
loseit,fegf4th,t3_eoxrle,1579090637.0,Just started watching my diet last wednesday after an eye opening physical with my doctor and I've lost 4.2 lbs so far. Very excited.
ADHD,ez50zgs,t1_ez4r0ox,1567694897.0,"I have long-lasting unexplained moods but I also have triggered moods. I'm not sure if I had any symptoms as a kid. I was very quiet and withdrawn. I got hyper-focused on things like reading or natural disasters and weather systems. I've never had a manic episode, but I've had happy periods of time that my psychiatrist calls hypomania but maybe I was just happy. It's so hard to say. I definitely need to sit down and talk about all of this with my psychiatrist or a new psychologist."
ADHD,ez4xyli,t1_ez4ojnc,1567693807.0,I think my moods can definitely change dramatically due to external factors. I can feel depressed and something positive happens and then I'm elated. Or I can feel okay and then super irritated. I have triggers rather than cycles. I've told my psychiatrist this but she still thinks it's bipolar. I see her next month and will bring it up.
aspergers,ez11bo8,t1_ez0y71h,1567644399.0,"Thanks, reading r/adhd has me considering this as a real possibility. I'm also unable to sit and watch TV without needing to do other things (it can take me up to three days to finish a movie, if I finish it at all) and I've always thought it was an annoying quirk but I now read that it's common with adhd. I definitely need to be assessed for these things."
aspergers,ez0k9wn,t1_ez0g1za,1567637963.0,"I tend to have a brain that won't ever shut up, and I can be very chatty depending on the topic, but I can also be silent and ""blank."" I'll check out the sub and see what they have to suggest. It would be nice to get an assessment to see what I'm working with but I'm afraid that they won't do it since I'm an adult/it'll be too expensive."
aspergers,ez0blau,t1_ez08je6,1567634403.0,"I've already done a degree in what I find interesting (history), so I'm looking for something more employable. Ultimately I think I can do it, especially if I go to the library where I can't nap or watch Netflix, it just feels a bit torturous."
aspergers,eyzuthp,t3_czn4rh,1567625203.0,"I suddenly remember the small details as well. I remember what candy I ate at my uncle's wake when I was four, I remember my mom telling me I was too old to pick up while pregnant when I was three, etc. My long-term memory is great."
aspergers,eyzsh6h,t1_eyzrag0,1567624017.0,I'm on a ton of meds for anxiety and bipolar disorder (which could be the wrong diagnosis entirely). I see my psychiatrist next month and will ask her what she thinks. I might need a new assessment entirely.
aspergers,eyzqmxm,t1_eyzpmh9,1567623129.0,"You're right. I've never been assessed for ADD/ADHD. I've only been assessed for mental health stuff. It's entirely possible I have that as well. I guess I never considered it because I wasn't aware of the inattentive type, just the hyperactive."

aspergers,eyyun9a,t3_czgfop,1567602283.0,"As a kid (undiagnosed) I stayed up late listening to what my parents were doing, I stayed up redoing my homework until it was perfect or I stayed up with anxiety about tornadoes or house fires. Often went into my parents' bed because of nightmares."
aspergers,eyyu8vw,t3_czh323,1567601955.0,"I either say nothing, and just listen and absorb information, or I overcompensate and become chatty and overshare and make sarcastic jokes (and I'm exhausted after)."
aspergers,eyw3q1y,t3_cz25zb,1567520110.0,"I've been told that I'm inscrutable. My expressions are hard to read and people don't know how to react to me. My expression doesn't change much and my tone is often inappropriate/flat/sarcastic sounding, so I generally throw people off. People think I'm deadpan all the time so I'm unintentionally funny."
aspergirls,eyw3d0a,t3_cyv85v,1567519842.0,"I'm undiagnosed, but my therapist suspects ASD. I wish my parents paid attention to my behaviour as a kid. They couldn't understand why I was a perfect kid at school but explosive with them and they never looked into it. They didn't look into why I stayed home sick so much with no obvious symptoms, when I was anxious and didn't want to see the other kids. They just thought I was a difficult kid and I felt really misunderstood and confused. I probably could have used therapy as a kid but that was never an option. Being aware is a huge thing. Listening to her cues and supporting her through challenges and celebrating even small victories is important. Feeling understood and accepted is everything."
aspergers,eytp992,t1_eytml2s,1567442330.0,"Yeah when I read about meltdowns it definitely sounds like my childhood. I remember putting a box with blankets in my closet and hiding in there to get away from people.

I guess part of me wonders if I'm on medication for no reason. Like am I trying to medicate away characteristics that are just part of ASD and I should learn to accept them instead? I spend a lot of time, effort and money trying to be ""normal"" and I'm not getting any closer. In fact I think I'm getting worse."
aspergers,eyth7ng,t1_eytfz5g,1567436498.0,I have. I got nervous and deleted my post there. Many of the posts resonate with me.
aspergers,eytdtj4,t1_eytclhb,1567433831.0,"That's a good metaphor. I know I'm good at presenting myself as capable and social and even charming but I feel like an awkward alien while doing so, and then I feel exhausted afterwards. My work colleagues knew me as the quirky funny girl because I overshared and made weird jokes. I feel almost like I'm watching myself from a distance when I'm socializing. I overthink about the rules. I ""practice"" situations in my head repeatedly before doing anything or going somewhere. When I make eye contact I think about the fact that I need to make eye contact and stop listening to the person. I noticed I do this with my therapist, which may have tipped her off."
aspergers,eytdcag,t1_eyta88a,1567433428.0,I've made a list of characteristics that I identify with to talk to my therapist about. I'll talk with her about moving forward. I see my psychiatrist next month so I might bring it up then. I wonder if I'm on a bunch of meds I don't need.

Anxiety,ey8cybt,t3_cw4g8v,1566917194.0,Put them in order of least overwhelming to most. You'll build confidence and momentum as you go and you'll do great.
depression,ey8crrn,t3_cw3kus,1566917066.0,I try to have a ritual that gets me motivated. For me that's feeding my animals and making a coffee. Once I've done those things I feel better about my day.
depression,ey8cn2l,t3_cvwgxt,1566916977.0,I saw something recently saying that when we don't feel like we have a home it's a sign that our life is in transition. That resonated with me.

Anxiety,ey85kpm,t3_cw3okz,1566911903.0,"Definitely have a conversation when she's not in an anxiety attack about what her needs are. Maybe practice some coping mechanisms with her when she's calm (like box breathing, grounding techniques) and you can remind her of these when she's anxious because we tend to forget about the tools in our toolkit when we're suffering. Continue to communicate and support her. It's so helpful."
Anxiety,ey74phy,t3_cvxd63,1566871754.0,I have bad financial anxiety. I avoid the bank and feel panicked when I have to pay bills. I live with student debt and I don't make a lot of money so it's always a simmering anxiety

Anxiety,ex8iix1,t3_crrfwu,1566073711.0,I remember being 9 and having a panic attack in class and needing my mom to come pick me up. We went to the doctor and she basically said I was a type A personality and she didn't have any recommendations. I was always anxious from a young age but that was the day I can pinpoint it as being a problem.
