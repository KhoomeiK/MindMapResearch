You can clear almost all content with free or low rarity units if you have a brain. The gacha system is also pretty merciful since you can get a 5* unit within 10 pulls of a banner guaranteed + they have a pity system for 6* units that carries over from banner to banner. 
You also actually need to have a brain to clear a lot of content which is rare for a gacha game.

The discord, youtube community, and wiki are pretty active so interacting with the community is pretty easy.
If you start playing now you’ll get a free 10 pull ticket (to celebrate 7m downloads).

Now this game isn’t for you if you can’t deal with grinding.
This is a game where you need your entire team to be solid and can’t have one over levelled unit carry. As a result you’re sorta forced to level your entire team fairly evenly so getting everyone’s levels up can be quite the task. You also have to be quite careful about where your putting your resources when promoting units since promotion can get quite expensive.
That basically means that at a certain point you’ll just be auto battling all day to grind for your team."

I think some places even let you take a break from school and come back when you’re feeling better.  I don’t know if school itself is what’s making you feel that way, but if it’s not helping you then I think you should definitely talk to your school counsellor and see what options you have. Please do try to talk to your parents even a little bit about how you’ve been lately.

I have a huge bag of frozen peas with carrots and at my old place I had a rice cooker so I there was a good month and a half where I was eating this every day. 
  
Ingredients :
* diced carrots
* peas
* diced white onion
* eggs
* rice 
* soy sauce
* salt
* oil (any kind is fine but I recommend sesame oil)

Toss everything in a pan, fry is up for a couple of minutes, serve.

* a bowl of rice (I prefer white short grain or black rice, but any kind is fine)
* sesame oil
* any kind of furikake (the type that comes in a shaker bottle is what I find most convenient)

You literally just toss everything into one bowl and mix. Simple, but damn it tastes good. If you have to energy to fry up an egg to eat with this that’s even better."

This is for 2 servings. (If it’s too much to eat in one sitting you can pack it up to eat later). 
  
Ingredients:
* 225g spaghetti noodles
* salt for the water to cook the noodles in
* 40ml olive oil (or just enough to coat the bottom of the pan)
* 3-4 cloves of sliced garlic
* 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
* 1/2 teaspoon parsley (fresh probably tastes better but dried is fine)  

Instructions:
* Boil your salted water, throw your pasta in. 
* While that’s going grab another pan for your sauce, throw in the garlic and red pepper (make sure the garlic doesn’t burn). 
* Once your garlic is slightly brown around the edges and your noodles are al dente, drain your pasta and throw it into your sauce. 
* Add the parsley and and cook for a few more minutes. Just watch that nothing starts burning and your noodles don’t start sticking to the pan.

Now you’ve made yourself something decent to eat. This takes around 15 minutes to cook. It’s also fairly easy to add things like frozen prawns, mushrooms, or cheese for extra nutritional value."

I really like wearing these boots with baggy outfits. I just feel like they provide contrast to loose-fitting clothes.
I really want to buy a pair of oxfords too ughhh"

I don’t think I’ve ever spent more than $30 on a single product. I also only buy to replace. My routine is 2-7 steps (not including putting on lip balm) depending on the time of day and how lazy I’m being. Today I’m so tired from traveling I literally just cleaned and moisturized. On average I think I spend a total of 10 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes at night."

Breath_of_the_Wild,er6a8th,t1_er6893c,1560543262.0,"To clarify, I know what you meant when you said “I obviously know that.” What I’m saying is that it’s *not* obvious that *you* know that (one can’t ride a bear). I was just using bears as an *example* of some of the things people don’t know exist. I was basically saying “Since there are people who don’t know that bears even exist how would I know that you know that one can’t board bears,” but in a less convoluted way (which was apparently too difficult to understand).

If you want to reply take it to PMs. I don’t want this to go on in OP’s thread."
Breath_of_the_Wild,er66swu,t1_er5yirh,1560541155.0,Actually it wasn’t obvious. Some people don’t even know that bears exist in this game so I wouldn’t know that was your intention. Definitely still is a funny feature of the game though.

gachagaming,equv5ml,t3_bzi3hd,1560336107.0,"How about Sdorica?
It’s like a turn-based puzzle sort of strategy game.
The main draws are:
- the story
- the art and music
- relatively F2P friendly bc almost all units are useful (all characters are unique) and can be upgraded to maximum tier
- requires very little grinding (unless you wanna level up your account fast)"

Sdorica,eq5j4pf,t3_bxd60g,1559802913.0,"She’s a rather low priority character.
Since you’re new to the game I suggest you focus your resources elsewhere.
If you don’t make use of her passive she comes off as a weaker Sione so if you’re using her as gold your team is probably gonna revolve around her revive gimmick.

As an advisor she has potential with Roger, but imo suicide Roger isn’t a great way to go.

If you insist on using her as gold she seems to work well with both Misa and Devious. (I don’t have them up to max level so idk for sure)

Misa can revive her in 2 turns and trigger charisma every time she revives.

Devious can kill her whenever and also revive her in 2 turns.

If Alice ever comes back her passive also helps to revive Shirley.

Koll also works well with her bc every time Shirley dies Koll will active his 4o for massive aoe damage.

Other characters that damage her like Sharice or Leah SP can be considered as well to help her die.

The only obvious advisors for Shirley are Experiment for easy 1 turn revive and Alice.

Hope that helps."
