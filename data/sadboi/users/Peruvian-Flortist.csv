ESFP,fpzobxb,t3_gg9swj,1589021171.0,"Nice work observing and labeling your paranoia, labels create distance between YOU and the symptom. If you‚Äôve picked a trustworthy, quality partner with respectable morals who lacks malicious intent and doesn‚Äôt have an impulsive inclination or turn to drugs/alcohol during periods of jealousy/fear of you cheating then you should be pretty safe. But try to remember that these feelings are just self protective messages based on the past, and that the future is undecided. Frequently remind yourself that you have lived without him before and you are capable of running your life independently, so you guys are more like a fruit salad than a fruit smoothie. 
The future is uncertain but love is worth a shot if you think you‚Äôre in the right space mentally in life to be the best you can be for your love interest. Go for gold and remember, trying to make sure that somebody stays in your life is trying to trap wind in a box. Be present, be in your body, be here now, and when you‚Äôre with him, repeat. Prioritise you well-being, identify the fears and barriers to your emotional and mental wellbeing in relationships and discuss them with your partner so they know the proverbial language you speak when it comes to relationships. :) sorry for the length"
