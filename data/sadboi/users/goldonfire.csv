SkincareAddiction,fqch489,t3_gi3q5f,1589258068.0,"Hiya! New here! So my question is, how can I tell if my skin is dry or dehydrated (or both if thats possible?). and How can I help my acne based on that when I have textures I cannot deal with and trouble with multi step routines?


Now a bit about my genetics and situation

My maternal uncle has very very dry skin, my dad is probs neither oily nor dry, my mum was oily. So I may be genetically predisposed either way. We have post-pubertal cystic acne on both sides of the family (my maternal second cousin is in her 30s and on yet another round of Accutane for it, my dad did Accutane in is 20s) I'm trans and on Testosterone so I'm going through puberty 2.0 right now, and its made my acne a lot worse (though the cystic ones aren't as frequent or as many this puberty?) 



I was reading about dry vs dehydrated skin, and wanted to know what my skin sounds like to you all. I have flaky skin on my nose, scalp, and cheek/jaw area, and I sort of get dragon scaly skin on my legs when its hot out (those California summers will do that to ya). It feels like its gonna crack sometimes when I smile, however since puberty 1.0, I've had a thick layer of oil on my cheekbones and nose (not rly on my forehead or jaw) by the end of the day. It was like this even when I was drinking at least probably 8 or 9 12oz glasses of water a day due to a med that stopped salivary glands from producing as much spit. I do recognize that I dont drink enough water these days due to the fact that I smoke cigarettes now (no lectures about this please. I know quitting will help my skin and my finances and my everythin but I'm not in a mental place to quit rn), but my skin has been the same for ages.


  I find my acne gets better when I moisturize, but anything heavier than Cetaphil daily moisturizer, and I break out even worse again all over the driest part of my face (with the Cetaphil morning and night my skin still gets flaky around my nose and jaw). Salicylic acid makes me break out too. I don't have the brain for a super multi step regimen, bc autism/adhd-related moderate to severe executive dysfunction. Also because of autism, the texture of an ointment or oil or anything goopy or heavy makes me want to rip my face off. 

I know this sounds stupidly complicated but I just want to fix my skin up even a little bit. Any tips or product recs would be greatly appreciated

edit: I just read that cleanser shouldn't leave u feeling squeaky clean. is there anything gentler than cetaphil gentle cleanser out there? like srsly. thats the one my dermatologist recced and it leaves me feeling pretty squeaky.



edit 2: I've also used the cerave daily moisturizer (not moisturizing enough but a good texture for my senses) and the cerave hydrating face cleanser. also felt a lil squeaky with that."
