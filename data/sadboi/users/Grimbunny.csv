Their jobs are hard and time consuming but disproportionately rewarding compared to as-important jobs like the anesthesiologist who needs to ensure their patient doesn't die or suffer on the table. This nice fuck-you money given to them disproportionately does make them have ""it so easy"".

&#x200B;

Partly agree with you though, that there are exception cases like you picked. In general, when you consider the ""non-bullshit"" jobs which are actually required to sustain society, the easier jobs are paid more."
Purism,ep5w6zh,t1_ep5unlv,1559061607.0,"The used devices from chip flashers like minifree, zerocat, vikings ,technoethical etc are fully refurbished(parts cleaned and replaced where necessary). The hard drives are overwritten in a secure way, if not replaced with new drives. The memory modules are always replaced(higher speed memory). These machines are also stress tested for around 24 hours to ensure they run well even under full load. The bios is literally undone, flashed with a non-proprietary blob-free bootloader (libreboot) and all proprietary components (including Intel wifi etc) are replaced with libre ones which have free open source  drivers on Linux.

These are independently tested by Free Software foundation, and vetted before being awarded RYF (respects your freedom) certifications. And all this follows the open source framework where any third party can audit the code, so I'm not concerned privacy wise nor about stability of used hardware.

But yeah there is the mental picture one has of using a ""used"" albeit refurb product which not everyone can deal with.

In any case, I'd rather use a regular laptop and slap Linux on than support price gouging and unsustainable business like Purism"
Purism,ep5u6q5,t1_ep5sfle,1559060927.0,"Glad you took the sensible route not splurging on a ""good idea"" but bad execution like Purism.

If privacy is a serious enough concern, a librebooted device such as the T400 is a great choice. It's a lot cheaper (as it should be, being a refurbished device) than most laptops and actually guarantees all open software including bios with no Intel ME.

The issue with ideas like Librem is that they need more adoption to actually pick up and develop the privacy features, disabling of ME completely, awareness etc. further, but the geniuses at Purism have priced them to do the opposite. That's why organisations like Coreboot and Libreboot advise against buying Purism."
Purism,ep5jq3w,t3_avhyfk,1559056945.0,"Purism is just gimmicky marketing bullshit. The laptops are worse than just overpriced - they're extortionately priced for the poor quality hardware (the screen, wifi, keyboard build quality and even the SD card slot speed are lacking when compared to even cheaper brand-name hardware). 

You're literally paying \*more\* than decked-out high end laptop prices for 2 generation old processors, poor build quality (in the long run), potential for flaky support (the company is small with a $1M revenue, might not even exist in some time), fake ""open hardware"" which isn't fully open as ME components still exist (it's just coreboot with ME cleaner which can be done yourself or bought cheaply for a Thinkpad upto X230/T430) all for the ""artisanal"" laptop feel - something like those expensive artisan waters which are more brand than product."
