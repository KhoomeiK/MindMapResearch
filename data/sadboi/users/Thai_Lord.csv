There is a straight forward way to figure out if someone is running a script or not. There are only so many variables and oddities a human would or wouldn't do, but I get your point. I think we're on different pages. No offense taken or anything. 

Do you think Jagex wants bots?"

There's a bunch of scenarios where I feel like the PvM players enjoy the lightheartedness of the game where they just want to have fun and that's them having fun and not having to pay real money and grind out for hours to regain items they lost out of frustration, so they quit and go to a new game. Call me crazy, but I think that's a large percentage of the user base. Comfort. If Jagex loses them, they also lose the PvP ""prey."" I'm not disagreeing with anything. It's a weird debate, but I think those people are the metaphorical glue and if this mechanic makes them panic or anxious abiut loss, they will leave."
2007scape,fhk7pis,t1_fhjx8sp,1581670798.0,"I agree, but how many other MMO's with a ""G.E."" tax have such a high volume of bots? I think Jagex needs to prioritize and figure out how many people are simply running scripts, and how many are actually playing the game because they enjoy it and aren't doing it as a job. I'm 100% certain they're(Jagex) benefiting from all these changes as a company, and the inflation of their user numbers are heavily influencing all of these mechanics and driving the game into the ground."
