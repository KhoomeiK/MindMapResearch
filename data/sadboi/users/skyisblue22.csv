I also want to state that nationalist fervor (the type seen in India against Muslims) could very well increase even more than it has in the U.K. post-Brexit against people considered to be 'foreign' and immigrants especially if economic conditions worsen, which they are predicted to do.

I just have been told in person repeatedly from Ojibwe and Lakota classmates in my environmental science program and various Indigenous  people online that it is different. But you're right a handful of people aren't representative of the vast diversity of Indigenous culture and thought. 

What I understand is there is a deeper connection to the land and religion inherent in Indigenous culture for some that they don't see as being present in Communism. In that Communist societies would view anything as a 'resource' to be extracted, shared or not, is problematic also the concept that anything can truly be owned in general is not consistent with many cultural norms and beliefs. That the mindset must be deeply rooted in respect for the natural world to the point of seeing other species of living things as equals with their own inherent autonomy.

It is my understanding that Indigenous peoples have a lot of empathy for the descendants of enslaved Africans who were brought here against their will to build the structures and wealth the U.S.
as a nation-state rose from. It is my belief they will be taken in and cared for regardless.

We do a lot of strange things in North American culture. Our culture changes frequently now thanks in large part to the internet (trends like the ice bucket challenge, people reorganizing their lives around new diets etc.) as does our language. We now see people completely change everything about their lifestyle in relatively short periods of time for various reasons.

Things have changed and cultures have changed and that is okay but certain values that still remain valuable to the Indigenous peoples in that area would be upheld in a way that they are not valued or even present in the larger colonial cultures in North America. 

You do not see tribes warring with one another now just as Scandinavian cultures are no longer raiding, raping, and pillaging their way through the UK. For the most part Indigenous peoples in the Americas have lived and worked along with the rest of the world, famously fought and play key roles in winning wars for the United States. We have to update our thinking here."
Permaculture,f6ult8r,t1_f6u59qy,1573164653.0,"Some Indigenous peoples even see systems such as socialism / communism / anarchism /   definitely capitalism as imperial colonial structures from Europe.

Permaculture,f6ui139,t1_f6ub2o3,1573163192.0,"Vincent is clearly not an ecologist with a specialization in silviculture. Decolonization doesn't mean the removal and death of millions of people, even though that IS what happened to the Native Americans by Europeans. Decolonization is returning the jurisdiction of the land over to the native tribes and decolonization of the culture of the society to better reflect the culture and values of the Indigenous tribes who had lived on the land for 10,000+ years before Europeans colonized the Americas."
Permaculture,f6uhg0g,t1_f6uf9vk,1573162961.0,Or any ecology class. We all can't be so lucky. I'm taking that if he knew better he meant endemic ecosystem restoration to the largest extent possible.
Permaculture,f6ugjl4,t1_f6u60xr,1573162599.0,"IF the Native peoples don't agree to them staying and they truly have no other lands to go or they wish to go back it would be the civilized thing to do for their ancestral lands to repatriate them.

Many Indigenous people have said that non-natives would not have to leave but that jurisdiction over the lands would be returned to the appropriate tribes and the culture of the communities there would be decolonized to better represent the values and traditions of the Indigenous peoples there."

Permaculture,f6twbgv,t1_f6trhep,1573154932.0,"Revitalizing the Bison population would definitely be a condition and goal for the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains.

As for California and water, the grotesque water usage in California for cash crops to be exported around the world (almonds, pomegranates) and lavish lifestyles (growing tropical plants with swimming pools and fountains in Los Angeles which should be dry coastal scrubland) would end. Living by the standards and goals of the Native peoples there would likely reduce water demand a substantial amount."
Permaculture,f6tumrj,t1_f6tm4vz,1573154288.0,"I don't think it would necessarily mean displacement, although it might. It would be up to the Indigenous peoples of that land.

Returning jurisdiction of the land back to the Native peoples is the first step. Decolonizing the culture of the people who remain on the land is the goal.

I am descended of immigrant families to the U.S. and while my ancestors did not directly steal the land they rented or were given or awarded land that was stolen. Even if they paid for it it was not theirs to buy. The history of the lands my family has lived on and the 'removal' of Indigenous peoples who inhabited them for 10,000 years or more is brutal.

I do think European countries (and other countries) do not properly take account of their roles in the genocide of the people of the Americas. In addition to the active colonization of the Americas by the Spanish, English, French and Dutch and murder, torture and slavery they committed while sending wealth belonging to the Indigenous peoples back home to be transformed into structures and treasures still present in Europe today, countries even sending/forcing a sizable portion of their population, desired or not, overseas to the Americas came at a very real cost to the Native Americans while this decrease in population benefited many of these countries due to decreased competition for resources at home.

Repatriating descendants of emigrants should be the very least of the  responsibilities taken on by European and other countries should Indigenous peoples decide they can no longer reside in what we now call 'the Americas'. Much of the wealth they stole from the Indigenous peoples of the Americas can never be given back so this is the very least they could do."
Permaculture,f6tpmw3,t1_f6tn2lw,1573152399.0,I love Gaia's Garden. I will definitely look that talk up. Yeah suburbs and now even exurbs and endless sprawl are not the way.
Permaculture,f6tjymt,t1_f6tjf9n,1573150041.0,Yeah I don't think the original poster has a background in ecology. Also grasslands are huge carbon sinks. But decolonization and endemic ecological restoration are the energy and goals to live by.
Permaculture,f6tihr3,t1_f6tiedq,1573149420.0,Permaculture is literally about integrating permanent cultures / ecosystems into human life the humans aren't going to be displaced.
Permaculture,f6tiedq,t1_f6thysm,1573149377.0,I thought this was a community about Permaculture. We need to live in ways that are the least taxing on nature as possible. Population size and density isn't the issue its the demands the culture or society puts on the natural world.
