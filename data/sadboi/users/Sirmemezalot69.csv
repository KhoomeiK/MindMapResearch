kroger,fr00zg4,t3_glgqms,1589780596.0,With us going back to normal instead of 6am-12am we are going to try 6am-11pm since we lose money that last hour. I don't mind.  And actually I am totally okay with that cause I still stayed till like 1 or 2 in the morning so some extra time without customers is better.

depression,fq8lhqu,t3_ghg3d0,1589169013.0,"I've felt nothing for years. Years.. I have nothing to show for my age, nothing to truly call mine. I work a dead end job that literally takes the life out of me. College fucking sucks and I just want to sleep to feel nothing. But when I sleep, i dream some pretty supernatural shit that scares the shit out of me. I'm just done. I don't want a second chance. I don't want to make it better i just want to leave myself and be nothing. But nothing is something so what's the true point of living in agony when you cant feel anything anymore."
teenagers,fq8kkes,t3_gh18vn,1589168366.0,Yeah I do. And it does kinda suck. That might be a factor as to why I get very low lows. But then I try to talk to them and yet they don't try and talk back. It makes me feel insecure and unwanted.
