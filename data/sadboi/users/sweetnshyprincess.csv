depression,ew0i2oz,t3_cm28m0,1564989990.0,I also had that one friend who I texted regularly but then I started to think that she didn't want to talk to me too so I haven't talked to her in months... And now I think she's mad at me and therefore really doesn't want to talk to me. So it's come full circle I guess.
