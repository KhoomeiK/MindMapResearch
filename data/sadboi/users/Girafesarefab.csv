Most of my items are ten dollars or less as I sell plants, unfortunately you have to offer free shipping to be competitive and be in the listings and then with marketing I wasnâ€™t making enough money for it to be worth packaging stuff up.

Where I get confused is if I sell to someone In say California do I have to search up californias sales tax percentage and manually input into Etsy, and then once a year send all the sales tax ive collected from California orders to California? Or do I only collect and send sales tax to the state I reside in? Again very sorry if this is a dumb question but any help understanding it so I donâ€™t get in trouble is super appreciated.

Aquariums,fekemdk,t1_fekdvus,1579198437.0,"Thank you! I will definitely check him out and his videos.  Iâ€™ve been doing plant sales for a while now, and Iâ€™ve made decent money off of it, especially locally. As far as fish go that again would be more of a local thing. Iâ€™m just not really comfortable shipping fish yet. I am comfortable with shipping plants though. I donâ€™t have much overhead and Iâ€™m all for quarantining fish, at least for a few weeks if not more. As far as driftwood and rocks go Iâ€™d love to have a large selection of those as well, especially would like to pretreat them as well. I think fish tank set ups and designs as well as maintenance is where I could make money. See the big thing for me is I absolutely love talking about the hobby, which leaving the retail scene is not something I would like to loose. So really just walking customers through everything step by step and being there for support is a big thing to me. You are very right, it is hard to compete with big box stores and of course online sales. Iâ€™m hoping to be able to at least offer the people the option to buy set ups straight from me, yeah probably for a bit more than amazon but at least thereâ€™s convenience. Itâ€™s a big step but currently Iâ€™ve been going through a lot of health issues and having the ability to set my own schedule and still do something with fish sounds amazing. Fish are therapeutic and I mean I guess worse comes to worse I fail. Hereâ€™s to hoping!!! Thanks again for all the tips, plants and shrimp seem to be definitely the way to go!"
