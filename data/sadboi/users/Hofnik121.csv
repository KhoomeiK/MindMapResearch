mentalhealth,fmc35xq,t1_fmby3qz,1585938032.0,"Yeah i probably wouldn't have gotten any work done by the end of the lockdown. My constantly low motivation to do anything is 100x worse when it comes to stuff i dont want to do wich is the reason i droped out of school in the first place. But there actually is one (just one) thing i really miss about school. My friends. Seeing them every day. I miss that. Haha i can imagine how boring that might be. Talking to my parents is like we are from completely different generations (well we are but you get my point lmao)  so (and that sounds kinda sad, mostly because it is) i usually just go to my room and stay there, basically ""avoiding"" my parents. I love them but its like they don't understand me and can't relate about anything i tell them. I also have 2 little sisters who are very annoying haha. You can get some very cheap gaming consoles if you go for some last gen stuff. Ps3 for example. It has some great and cheap games. Like I've seen a ps3 for sub 40 bucks with gta 5 for 3 bucks. You'll have to look a bit but it's worth it haha. If you are more of a casual gamer who likes his consoles convenient id recommend the Nintendo DSi + an r4 card (a ds card that lets you put roms on it so you dont have to buy the games. But its not very legal sooo...) What im trying to say is that there are a lot of cheap ways to play some games. That kidney part is only true if you want a good gaming pc including the setup haha

Sorry for this giant text wall haha"

Well im still at work and have been since about 10 am, so my day has been pretty much all about work. I kinda feel out of place here haha everyone here is like 35+ years old and im still 18. Its weird when we have our brake and they talk about ""old people"" stuff and i just sit there haha. Don't get me wrong. These people are so incredibly kind. They make me feel like we're a family... Just a family where im the youngest haha. Today was a pretty busy day so i just got to sit down and take a break. Do you really have no way of playing videogames? Man that must suck haha"

I played it to death on my silver DS lite but then lost the cartridge D; my other ""later childhood"" game haha is Minecraft. I had so much fun in this game, building and destroying, exploring with or without friend. Just have so many fond memories of this game. And my current favorite game is Rocket League. Ive invested over 1000 hours with my best friend who i met through the game. How about you? Do you have any favorite videogames?

Stay safe out there :( i whish you and your family best of luck. But as long as you social distance yourself you should be fine.

This sounds kinda sad but i have spent several thousands of hours in videogames during my life and i genuinely think that i wouldn't be who i am now without videogames. 

i also hope i dont have the virus. Not because of myself, I dont care about myself, but because im scared that i might infect my parents who both will probably actually die from the virus due to their poor health. (Also im a dude haha so ""man"" would have worked. How about you?)"

We are still allowed to walk outside as long as we aren't in a group with above 2 people. Ngl im kinda scared rn because im coughing a lot but that just may be my asthma
