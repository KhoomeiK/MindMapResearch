One of the other comments says this combo is “pretty rough”. That doesn’t mean anything coming from someone who isn’t a doctor. I’ll say that in my subjective and unique personal experience with different meds that happen to include lithium along with several others, it can sometimes be difficult to succeed with medicines when you’re irrationally afraid of them. When I started taking them, anything bad that would happen would immediately be blamed on the meds. They do good things and bad things but not every bad thing that happens to you is a side effect. You can change up your meds whenever but if you kill your self you’re out of the game for good. There’s no med that you can’t go off once you’re on it that I’ve ever heard of. You’ll usually have to taper but nothing is permanent. Also I can say with certainty that 300mgs of lithium is a tiny dose. That’s coming straight from my doctor."

If you decide you’re gonna do it that’s one thing, but if not then you need to realize you’re stuck here for probably a really long time and you gotta get your shit together. I lived in that “I wish I was dead” phase for a while and I think it’s actually worse than being fully suicidal. If you’re really suicidal you just do it and it’s over but in that middle ground it’s just suffering with no end. Eventually I got my plans together and put death right in front of me, note written and pills ready, and then denied it. Once suicide was off the table I was able to actually get to work on fixing my life. I’m not telling you to kill yourself, but I am saying that you need to either deal with suicidality directly or recognize that you’re not gonna do it and stop dreaming about it. Life is like a party, if you stand by the door with your coat on thinking “I’ll probably leave soon” but never do you just waste your own time. Hang up your coat and dive in."

You also might just be getting a little depressed which can turn into a lot a bit depressed faster than you can blink so you might also consider getting a therapist on-board just in case you’re showing early signs.

If today sucked then tomorrow will probably also suck, but if you can do a teeny tiny thing today that makes tomorrow a teeny tiny bit better than today, you’ll slowly get closer. I wouldn’t blame you for killing yourself, I have no idea how I managed to not do that, but I can tell you I was absolutely certain beyond all doubt it would never get better but when I really finally went to kill myself, had the whole thing set up and was only a moment away, some hopeful light in my brain went on and has stayed on ever since (mostly)."

Also twenty years isn’t really that old and you seem smart as a whip, college is a dying fad anyway. Suicide isn’t a really crazy thing to me anymore so I don’t always necessarily freak out when someone says they’re thinking about it but being as young and as smart as you I think you are capable of taking steps in the direction of a better life. I don’t think you should move away or even hate all these people in your life, just try cut them out so that’s it’s like they never existed and you’re born again without a family. Make a plan that includes tiny improvements and accept that your life sucks and is going to suck for a while, but if you’re making small improvements everyday then it’s literally impossible that your life won’t get better long-term.
