Yes that is true. Must be tough to get an honest project off the ground these days anyway. I figure bitcoin kinda snuck by, under the radar. In fact, I think satoshi had to ask the wikileaks wizard to put off the announcement of wikileaks acceptance/utilization of bitcoin donations, because he was afraid bitcoin would take too much heat and that it might not be strong enough yet. Aww it's cute in a way how satoshi responded, like daddy protecting his child, making sure it's mature enough before going out to hunt on its own.
