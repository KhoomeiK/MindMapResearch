As a mother myself I cannot imagine your pain I also have a child who is an addict and I am one as well and watching him go through what I went through was heartbreaking not to mention the guilt I have. I hope and pray everyday he never goes back to drugs, but he is only 22 and has lots of life to live. People don’t understand what it’s like as a parent to watch your child die a little each day when they are caught in the disease of addiction, and have absolutely no control over any of it!! I would highly recommend grief counseling, therapy and Ala-non, as you mentioned you have a grandchild and another child to live for. The best you can do is take it one day at a time and I know that sounds so cheesy, but really it’s all you can do. I have a strong feeling that something good is going to come out of all this. All that you have endured, and continue to endure, has to have a purpose behind it. Addiction is a horrible disease, and like other diseases , it’s life threatening, but at the same time it’s like no other diseases, and that’s what makes it so complex. I will keep you in my prayers. I just know that you keep sharing your story and your pain is the only way to start the healing. There will be healing, if you want it!you deserve it! You deserve to live out the rest of your days on this earth with some peace and happiness. Your sons would have wanted that, and your grandchild and other child need it as well.

I honestly have been hit with so much in my life ( I’m 44) and even when sober I never felt like life was really good. Better, but not great. A lot of it is probably from my depression I’ve had since 15...I’ve also been on meds with little help. I didn’t do anything, not even drink from 22-35. At 35 I went through a divorce and my life turned upside down. Started popping pills and drinking wine daily. When I got sober 4 years ago I felt like it got to the point of being manageable but keep in mind these last 4 years have also been really hard. From finding out my 20 year old son was using heroin, committed a crime while high on Xanax and went to jail first time ever, to a loss of job, relationship problems, and absolutely no support system from my parents who are severe narcissists and I finally had to cut them out of my life.

Like cranberry with sparking water and lime so that it feels more festive and like a celebration but without the alcohol. It’s less likely to feel left out that way. Also, you don’t have to attend everything your invited to. Take it easy and if you need to leave early that’s ok too. It may be to difficult a situation the first holiday get together sober and if so, leave early , take some desert to go and take a bubble bath at home instead! Good luck! You got this!"

I was already very interested in Islam before I met him. You can still love Jesus and be Muslim. For me, Islam answered a lot of questions that Christianity could not . As far as I know it’s permissible for a Muslim to marry a Christian woman, but not the other way around. Now that’s is what Islam teaches, but Pakistani culture/ tribalism is what they are going off of saying that he can’t be with a Christian woman, that is not Islam , that’s their own Pakistani beliefs! Mostly comes from the parents traditions. There is nothing wrong with him marrying you according to Islam, but it will make your lives more strained and you won’t have have special bond, until you convert. Now if you think it’s something you may be interested in, then I would say stay with him and fight for each other, but if you know in your heart that you have no interest in converting and doubt you ever will I think you should let him go out of love. Allah can do anything, and if your heart is sincere and you love him , and aren’t dead set on not becoming a Muslims, then ask Allah to show you the truth and he will!!"

Without him being taught the tools and coping skills he has about a 75% chance of going right back into the cycle of addiction unfortunately. The best thing you can do for him and yourself is set some boundaries for yourself on what you wi not tolerate , and it would be very beneficial for you to go to Al-Anon meetings so you can get some support as well . Tel him you are worried about him relapsing and if nothing changes, nothing changes, so he must do something different this time around! Tell him it’s a brain disease and you don’t judge him whatsoever... and when he has cravings ( bc he will) to go to a meeting. They are everywhere... . It’s a really tough disease but if he puts his recovery first, he can recover and have an amazing life!! Keep me posted, and wishing you all the best!!"
