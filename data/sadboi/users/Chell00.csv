AskWomen,fqm16hm,t3_gjlj1y,1589469717.0,"My dad would play OG Doom and I was like 2 or 3 when it came out. Much to my mother's dismay he'd let me watch or he'd put me in his lap while he played. He'd also play Quake and Duke Nukem (he'd mute that one because language) and pretty much any other ""Shoot'em up"" game and still does.

Also, our version of ""Family Game Night"" was me and my parents playing a 90's Point and Click adventure game, like Tex Murphy or Gabriel Knight. Dad would ""drive"" while Mom and I would suggest what to do next. 

To this day I still love both genres, and so does my dad, who will be 70 this year!

You can hide posts in your history, I believe. For whatever reason Reddit is fucky and even though a post gets reported it'll stay in your history, at least in my experience.

I hope you get the help you need. You're worthy of love and kindness.

It takes a lot of courage. I'm gonna suggest what everyone else has been suggesting and say see a therapist. There are usually sliding scale therapy offices that adjust their rates to your income if you google search in your area.  And I don't know what country you're in or if you're in college, but a lot of bigger campuses in the US offer free counseling for that sort of thing (a well kept secret for some reason).  It was hard for me to move past my manipulative relationship, and it was not even to the extent of abuse you endured, and I still do things in my current relationship that make my boyfriend go ""??"", but you can heal and you can bounce back from this but I think it'll take time and work.

Also, maybe out of line, but I saw your other post you're very attractive! A nice bone structure and a kind face (I feel a little creepy telling an internet stranger they're attractive but it's for a good cause!). Eye of the beholder, man. Maybe you don't see it but I can guarantee you other people will, especially once you start recovering from this awful journey and gain some confidence back 💗"

AskWomen,f6q83jo,t3_dsgyji,1573072540.0,"I was a special education teacher, but I live in Texas and considering I worked in a wealthy district and cost of living is on the lower side, the pay made it pretty comfortable (and I live by myself, no kids or SO). But pretty much needing to be available to answer emails 24/7, the judgemental coworkers, the piles of paperwork, the inability of administration to be forgiving that I didn't have a degree in education (alternative certifications are a thing in TX) so my first year of making many mistakes in my paperwork had them pretty much writing me off as an idiot slacker, I was never told to my face if I had done something wrong, I would have a perfectly pleasant conversation with my principal then ten minutes later receive an email from her telling me how irresponsible I was for not doing x, y and z. Micro managing can't even begin to cover what that place was like. The summers off and two weeks for Christmas weren't worth it. I was in a constant anxious state, everything set me off into tears, like I was walking on eggshells for three years straight. I thought that's just how adult jobs were, and I didn't know that I was just working in an insanely toxic work environment. Also I learned I don't really enjoy children, nothing against them or people who have them, but how people say they're not ""cat people"" I'm not a kid person. 
  

 In July I started an entry level administrative assistant position for a great health care company downtown. The work is pretty easy, everyone is genuinely kind, and they all think I'm charming and funny. I feel welcome and valued. And I have my weekends back to relax rather than worry about lesson plans and then how administration will pick apart my lesson plans. Everyone in my life has noticed a huge difference in me. I get paid about 10k less but I don't even care. I feel happy for the first time in a very long time.
