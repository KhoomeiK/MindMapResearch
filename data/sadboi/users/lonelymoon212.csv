lonely,flij6xq,t3_fovw27,1585183674.0,I've found that when there is no one else to turn to and no one there at all God is and He seems to fill that void when you're completely broken. Gotta be completely broken tho. If you are still standing he's standing beside you but as soon as you fall God is there to pick you up again. Most of the time God is my only friend and only support in the whole world. My prayers are just cries of why and help me most of the time. God hears and he usually sends some form of comfort even if its just an inward peace of knowing some day ill be in heaven and all of this will be over.

i understand that not everyone knows what to say. but honestly all they need to say is how am i doing. that's not that hard. 

i don't think i could let people know how i feel to their faces tho, i need to be asked. i don't like just dumping my feelings.

UnusAnnus,fcpklrm,t3_eia5gx,1577866396.0,"on the topic of the huge jump cut afte the wall punch 

they probably had to cut it out for mark's reputation. cause like when you get punch a wall angry. that's like really angry. key the use of the word angry. not mad. angry. like some stuff probably went down. stuff mark isn't proud of. you can tell through the rest of the video that Ethan is 1. wary of Mark, and 2. doesn't really have the same hyper happiness. he's hurting but joking through it. as usual. I love them but sometimes mark is really mean to Ethan and since Ethan is my favorite i get kinda all momma bear on the situation.  you can also tell that mark feels really bad about the whole situation cause he kept bringing it back up and the little cheeky boosts to Ethan's self confidence. telling him he's great, laughing extra hard at things Ethan says.  there were probably some heated words exchanged or just from mark cause he seems to be really really sorry and just punching a wall doesn't equal that much regret. 

hi, id like my psychology degree now."
UnusAnnus,fcnhimi,t3_ei4hnc,1577811828.0,"out of context i would feel so bad for him cause i feel like he wants to react that way to mark roasting him lol
