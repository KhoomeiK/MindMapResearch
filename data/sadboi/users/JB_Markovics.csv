You don't have to blame yourself from everything you had done wrong because it might only ruin your life as a person. You see, a lot of people kind of feel on the same thing as you are. But I tell you, you don't have to kill yourself because I'm pretty sure someone will embrace your will."
depression,epwprrm,t3_bw23tp,1559581765.0,Yeah it seems strange.
depression,epvlqct,t3_bvup45,1559539006.0,Yeah same for me. I feel thesame way but honestly I'm just pretending to be happy even though it really hurts inside of me. But I'll just keep my way intact knowing it never show and never go away. Somehow I don't know how I supposed to get rid off it 😭😭😭
depression,epplmfo,t3_bvebca,1559384132.0,Yeah I feel the same way. But most part of me was overwhelmed.
depression,eouxmh1,t3_bt0kck,1558883607.0,It's not about the personal looks because that is not necessary to anyone else. Most of the people judge the looks of other people. You just have to believe yourself that you can do the things that others cannot. And it's not about being ugly.
depression,eomzbyl,t3_bs9kpn,1558699433.0,"I feel the same way. I struggled in my thesis as if I was working so hard and seriously with effort but everything in the end went pointless. On the first place they told us to do thesis which is our final and they regret at the end.  So it's just a waste of time and effort. I mean, c'mon."
depression,eoidixd,t3_brsy1y,1558617193.0,Well I feel the same with that situation. Being motivated is much more difficult challenges. The more I pushed everything that makes me so painful is more depressed than I feel in same way.
asmr,eohsu7n,t3_brwsbd,1558593786.0,This is getting better and better than I thought. 👍👍👍
asmr,eofrd61,t3_brho06,1558541630.0,"Wow very nice, so entertaining at the same time it tingles from every part of my feelings. 👍👍👍 keep it up."
