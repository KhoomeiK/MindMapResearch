Xenonauts,fqql8ri,t1_fqqkbnt,1589567481.0,"I don't think you can do anything more complicated, as I said the classes are more of a reminder for yourself or an organization tool, a prime example is that I usually have two types of shield guys, one who has high TU and walks arouns ahead spotting aliens so I can setup my gunners and snipers and get sight of the alien to shoot it, and another that has high HP that I use with a heavy and two shotgunners to enter first in alien ships, their loadouts are the very same, no changes at all, yet I created different classes for each just to remind me of who is who, the Breacher and the Scout."

stonehearth,fplkfio,t1_fplf3j1,1588714311.0,"Sure, I'll split them in categories by how much they change the game experience or how important they are in my opinion.

Must have gamechangers:

ACE (Authorized Community Expansion)

Archipelago+Fisher

Firefly Clan+Swamp+Beast Tamer

Nordlings

Ace Armours

All of the mods in this category offer lots of stuff even if you are not playing in their biome and/or using their faction, you may play in the basic forest map with the first most basic faction and all those mods would still greatly affect you and improve your experience.


Big and wide improvements but depends on personal taste:

Muramasa Clan

Jewel of the orient

Necromancer Class (Standalone)

Wizard Quest

Extra Map Options

Cleric Combat

Everything here is as big and impactful as the ones on the previous category, however this set is a lot more personal and some might look at a few of them and think ""eh, not my thing"".


Not very impactful or extremely personal:

More Realistic Farming (MRF)

Food, not friends

Amberstone and Orc Job Expansion

Combat Dash

That's it, I don't use any templates mod because I like to actually build my own cool stuff, hope this list helps you somehow.

A final note, I used both Fruits & Animals (Box 'O Vox) mod and Glassworks mod a lot some time ago and they are great mods but are not in this list because they haven't been updated to the final versions of the game before development stopped so they are very old, outdated and will cause you a storm of bugs, errors and crashes so avoid those two even though they might look tempting."
stonehearth,fp35qh1,t3_gb03dc,1588273553.0,"I've always been into this kind of game and I've played most of them, if you are willing to install mods then Stonehearth is one of the best games of the genre currently out there.

Most of the negative opinions are (understandably so) because of the devs stopping development and leaving the game unfinished, this obviously made a lot of people get sour about the game, yet it still is very worth the price in it's current state and with mods it becomes a masterpiece.

Personal recomendation of essencial mods are ACE, Muramasa, Nordlings, Arquipelago+fisher, Jewel of the orient and Swamp+beast tamer (Firefly Clan). I use a lot more but the others are more personal."

Try the same again with 3 artilleries, 5 gunners and everything else meatshields and see ifit goes better.
