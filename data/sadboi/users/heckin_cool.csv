I hope it's before the finale, I would love to see some good old InuKag family ass-kicking. Since we saw one way someone can be incapacitated for a long time with Inuyasha's tree curse in the very beginning, it wouldn't surprise me if whatever happened to him and Kagome was something similar and Moroha eventually has to free her parents from a curse. A baby is a really easy target for enemies (which her parents have a LOT of) so a particularly cunning demon could definitely find a way to leverage Moroha's safety against her parents to get into a vulnerable situation."
inuyasha,fqsn67w,t3_gkphh7,1589612187.0,"Shoujo has come a long way since the 90s/early 2000s in terms of tropes and whatnot. Plus, Takahashi herself specializes in shounen and has written several excellent shounen series with female main characters besides Inuyasha. I think that if anything, the setup of Yashahime sounds really progressive. 


Based on your comment history you seem upset about the lack of fanservice potential...which usually happens in any series, for better or for worse. I should point out that the main girls are barely even teens though? If you're looking for fanservice there are already adult guys like Sesshomaru, Inuyasha, Koga, etc. who are definitely gonna be getting screentime.


Also, we haven't seen anything yet about Sango and Miroku's kids but they already are known to have at least one son."
inuyasha,fqsmm1g,t3_gki9q2,1589611689.0,Meido is a really cool nod to Inuyasha's (and Sesshomaru's) connections to the demon world and their ability to use it for good or evil. Plus it just looks dope lol

Two guys in his office tested positive and all of his employees either quit/called out indefinitely. With just him and my mom at the office they got overwhelmed really fast and it led to my mom having a borderline psychotic break at home, so for the sake of keeping peace at home I offered to help them out. I figured if they got sick I'd get it anyway by virtue of living with them so what's the big deal. Go figure, a few days after I first went in to the office I start having symptoms. Then my stepdad gets sick. It's a little over a week later now and I feel like shit, and I'm really angry that I got pressured into going to an active Covid site right before my college finals started.

The dull headaches and neck pains were/are constant for me too, and also still having restless sleep plus fatigue."
COVID19positive,fqlc8p4,t3_ggyv6r,1589453681.0,"20F (plus 52M & 55M)

There have been 3 sick persons in my family this month including myself. My father 52M works in an office that had 2 confirmed cases in April (one of whom went back to work after her symptoms stopped and then relapsed into an active case). My stepfather 55M (different household, bio parents divorced) also works in an office that has had 3 confirmed cases in the last 2 weeks. Both of them are essential workers with no pre-existing conditions so they continued working despite these active infections at their workplace. 

Around the same time last week all 3 of us began having symptoms. I had the mildest case a day after going in to assist at stepfather's office answering phones, which would've been last Monday. Not sure if I got it from him (been living with him and mom) or from the office itself, but the next evening I came down with a low grade fever, serious headache and occasional dry cough. The fever lasted 4 days and the headache still hasn't gone away. Re: temperature I never got chills per se but I experience hot/cold flashes out of the blue. Normally my blood pressure is pretty low so sometimes my vision gets spotty when I stand, but during all this I fully blacked out several times. I also had body aches at various points. Temp is still holding at 99.

Last Thursday my bio dad got sick and he was in rough shape. 102‚Å∞F fever, labored breathing, nonstop cough, chills, body aches. Described the feeling of breathing being like holding your breath underwater for too long and not being able to inhale enough when you break the surface. He seemed to make a pretty sudden recovery on Tuesday. Weirdly enough he got tested yesterday and was negative. I don't see how that's possible. 

Stepdad also was hit suddenly like the rest of us on Friday. He was tested a week prior when his coworkers got sick and it came back negative along with my mother's. Came home from work, laid down, suddenly he had a high fever and couldn't stop coughing. Literally stayed in bed and just tried to breathe steadily all weekend. By Monday he was good enough to go back to work. (For the record the only people in his office right now are my household members and 2 workers who already tested positive and recovered. Not saying I agree with it but they can't shut the place down.)

One thing we all noticed was that the headaches we had were really particular. Centralized in our foreheads and sinus area, wrapping around to our temples. Feels like that ache you get from wearing a tight hat for too long. We also were very fatigued despite sleeping a lot.

Anyway, like I said they both got tested and it was negative. I didn't get tested but I want the antibody test. There's a chance what I had wasn't Covid but holy hell, they both had textbook symptoms. Are there any reports of false negatives coming back from swab tests? Both of theirs were done via a drive through clinic.

EDIT : stepdad was retested, came back positive."
AskReddit,fql0kfa,t3_gisydd,1589442128.0,"So this happened when I was around 16 and on vacation with my family in New Orleans. I've always been morbidly curious about occult stuff so while we were there my younger sister and I went to this famous voodoo shop and got our fortunes read. I had a tarot reading that was really accurate but nothing weird. My sister, though, got a palm reading that got a bit spooky when the fortune teller asked if she was prone to talking in her sleep. I said ""Hell yeah, she does it all the time. Really loud too."" And they just simply said ""Sleep talkers have a connection to the dead. Sometimes the dead will try to send messages to the living by speaking through them."" Ok, sure, that sounds cool.

Later that night my sister and I are sharing a double bed in our hotel room with our parents in an adjacent room. It's like 1am and she's knocked, but like usual I was wide awake messing around on my phone. Out of nowhere the kid sits BOLT UPRIGHT with her eyes open looking straight ahead and says ""_It's not our fault_"" in a kind of gravelly voice. I was frozen for a second before I finally choked out ""Uh, what isn't?"" She just repeated the same thing, ""It's. Not. Our. Fault."" and then laid back down. what the fuck. As soon as she hits the pillow she's out again, nothing out of place. I woke her up straight away and asked what she meant, but she had zero recollection of anything--she had really been asleep. 

Honestly I still don't know what's supposedly ""not our fault."" The only thing I could think of was that our parents had recently divorced (we were traveling with mom and stepdad) but I don't know if that warrants a sinister message from the afterlife."

Also, I have stopped taking my zoloft for no reason other than that I cant motivate myself to open a new prescription bottle. It's been about 5 days since I last took it. 

I think what really pushed me over the edge today was getting a message from a former friend who all of a sudden decided to tell me that I've wronged her beyond forgiveness for a genuine mistake I made 6 months ago. She literally hadn't talked to me since this semester began and then out of the blue sent this to me, while I had no idea it was even still an issue. So I'm feeling like a total piece of shit seconds away from just deleting all of my social media and cutting off my nonessential contacts.

AskReddit,foadf01,t1_fo8n0db,1587644846.0,"My 6th grade social studies teacher was really similar. He was actually a student teacher but due to the regular ss teacher being on maternity leave, he ended up being in charge of the class for most of the year. Anyway, dude was like 23 and got a reputation for being VERY strict about enforcing the female dress code. He'd go up to the female students with a ruler and stop them so he could measure the length of their skirts/shorts. He was also known to relentlessly bully certain female students in the same fashion as a kid would bully their crush. It was so gross.

He actually was a regular at the gym my mom worked at and I guess took a liking to me. He would approach me in the gym and ask me to watch him work out, asking what I thought about his muscles and shit. Then at school he would tell me in front of other students that my mom was hot and he wanted to fuck her. And that I looked like her. (I don't. ) oh, and he also mentioned wanting to eat my dog.

Fortunately that fucker never got hired for a permanent teaching position because so many parents complained about the weird shit he did. Unfortunately he's now a successful real estate agent in my town."

If you're traveling through CIEE I would say you're probably getting cancelled; they've been very open with us about the fact that the summer terms in Japan are all but terminated.

LoveNikki,fj3j6pq,t1_fj3j5af,1582985244.0,It means the eyes are looking to the side instead of toward the player :)
LoveNikki,fj3bv7s,t1_fj3ansq,1582977606.0,Thank you for this!!
LoveNikki,fj2x9y3,t3_fb8ic3,1582957377.0,"Sorry if this list is missing any; I tried to include all of the relevant makeups I could find but I was mostly going off of my personal wardrobe so there may be a few I missed. Also, a lot of these are subjective. Some makeups kind of look like they face the side but don't quite look right (ex. Arch Brows) so I didn't include them. Anyway, I hope this helps some of you when you're planning SC outfits!"

It felt like one of those [water jelly tube](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimages-na.ssl-images-amazon.com%2Fimages%2FI%2F71focU1CLAL._AC_SX425_.jpg&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCurious-Minds-Busy-Bags-Jellyfish%2Fdp%2FB078X45KWC&tbnid=rekKeeS_dqA0jM&vet=12ahUKEwjc4PmVyfPnAhVMAaYKHWVhA_EQMygAegUIARCMAg..i&docid=AnQz87KjexD5NM&w=425&h=308&q=water%20jelly%20tube&ved=2ahUKEwjc4PmVyfPnAhVMAaYKHWVhA_EQMygAegUIARCMAg) toys and my foot slid right into the opening. To this day I have no idea what it was. Maybe a sand shark's mouth?? But it didn't hurt at all. It definitely wasn't a jellyfish, that's for sure."

I think my diet may actually be improving here. I'm highly sensitive to dairy and thanks to the traditional Japanese diet being low on dairy, I've physically felt quite good. I will watch out for salt, though."
antinatalism,fivlv55,t3_f9y9cg,1582762947.0,"My dream job is within my grasp but it pays in scraps, honestly. I'm glad that I've never wanted kids because if I did I'd most likely have to sacrifice my ideal career. As a single woman, though, it's definitely a livable wage. I was lucky to get hired for a relevant position in high school so coming out of college I have the prerequisite 2+ years of career experience needed for a decent position. Most people in the field are not nearly that fortunate though."
SkincareAddiction,fivkkke,t1_fivkdv5,1582762169.0,"I don't think that's it, sorry. I've been more relaxed here than ever, away from my somewhat abusive family. I have been spending a lot of time in nature and with friends so stress is at a minimum."
SkincareAddiction,fivk7t6,t3_fa2xmz,1582761956.0,"My routine

AM:

- wash with Burt's Bees chamomile cream cleanser 
- apply liberal amounts of Cetaphil daily moisturizer (I'll also use a sheet mask on days when I notice my skin is a bit drier than normal)


PM:

- wash with cream cleanser 
- 2nd wash with Burt's Bees salicylic acid pore scrub 
- wipe face with red stridex pad
- on alternating days apply 0.1% differin gel 
- moisturize, moisturize, moisturize

(I know it looks like a lot of SA but it's what had been working well for me back home!)"
