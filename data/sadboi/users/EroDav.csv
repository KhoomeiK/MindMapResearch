teenagers,fbob3tm,t3_ee1ade,1577008729.0,"Dude we are all pfp with text, irl all we are is meat bones and sound waves, we all use this platform as a way to talk to people, we use it too seek friends, answers or just for cool things - if someone comes across someone who is hurting or venting, then it’s only natural to check up on them, afterall we are all humans ragardless of how contact forms"
teenagers,fboaeak,t3_ee1pm6,1577008556.0,"OP, people do that sometimes, I’ve personally done it may times - you don’t need to kill your self over that lack of interaction, I know it can hurt like hell not having someone there, but if you kill yourself before you even get a chance to find more friends, then what’s the point of searching at all?

Everyone in life struggles with things - some more than others, I’ve had a somewhat hard life and I have tried suicide, and thus I know why it’s a fucking retardedly dumb thing to do, ending it all wont stop your pain, it won’t stop anything - then friends you insulted will know why you did that and they will be broken from it, that irl girl will see it as her fault for not noticing, and she will blame herself - it’s not just about how you feel, but others too.

You may not feel like what they feel matters, and if you do feel like that then I ask you, what do you want in your future, if you don’t care about what others feel then for what reason do you want friends?

Is it to fill the boredom or whiteness?

Because if it is then you need to find hobbies too, you say about poems, start publishing them on apps like Wattpad, get a following, upload things that people will enjoy and soon you’ll have a community of people who all want you to be you and do what only you can do for them.

Never the less, suicide isn’t the choice, it’s a last resort and I you have any more things before death, you can have a bright future if you only allow yourself to see yourself into the light, good luck bro, I wish you the best and all the happiness in the world,"
