TheGreatGatsby,fouuae4,t3_g9m4bf,1588090513.0,"I think during the time frame of the book,  then it's nick and George Wilson that actually change. Wilson finally snaps and violently seeks to punish the person he not only believe was having an affair with his wife, but also who was resonating for her death. He went from an inactive figure, or a more passive character, to an active and indeed murderous character over the situation. 



Nick I think is genuinely disgusted with the shallow and materialistic world around him that he actively engaged in and that Gatsbys death triggered that realization and changed him. 


I would argue that Gatsby changed also,  but that occurred before the novel started and he too changed but followed his idealism and such to a place of fantastical proportions."
