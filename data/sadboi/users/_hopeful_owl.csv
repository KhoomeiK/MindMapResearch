TrueChristian,ey10aac,t1_exibdbz,1566686669.0,"I'm no expert in any way. I'm struggling a lot myself to be honest. But I wanted to try, even in my condition, to offer some bit of hope or encouragement. 

As for reading, I don't think I'm knowledgeable enough about the Bible to definitively tell which books are the most helpful. Honestly, I think reading the whole Bible would be a good idea. There is wisdom and vital knowledge contained in all of the books. God has messages for you throughout the whole work, and only you can go through and find those messages meant for you. What I can say is that the Bible contains words of life. God saves people through reading His word. Remember Psalm 119:11 that I quoted above. We read and memorize scripture because it helps to transform and renew our minds and because it helps to keep us from sinning. 

As an example of that, I was reading in Proverbs yesterday and came across a verse I'd never noticed before: ""Where there is no counsel, the people fall; But in the multitude of counselors there is safety."" (Proverbs 11:14) and ""Without counsel, plans go awry, But in the multitude of counselors they are established."" Thankfully I read my Bible that day otherwise I wouldn't have had this reminder to then share with you. Interesting how that works. Sometimes we read for the benefit of others before we're shown who it's going to benefit. 

So the next question I have for you is, do you have any counselors? Are there any born again believers you're still in touch with or can get in touch with who can be praying for you and can be giving you counsel while you go through this ordeal? Please let me know. There is someone I have in mind that I could put you in touch with, someone who I believe is born again, that could possibly help you. Though, it's preferable that you're in touch with more than one person, the more counsel you receive the better, as it states ""in the multitude of counselors."" I'll be thinking and praying about other people who I can direct you to also. 

Also, I wanted to ask if you could tell me your name so that I can continue praying for you?

Also, maybe pray about which books in the Bible to start reading first."

TrueChristian,exi0x2b,t3_csgitc,1566318670.0,"Please read all the way through. It's long, but I believe there are some key things in it for you. 

Have you tried fasting? I read some of your other posts and through this thread and it sounds like you might be possessed. That could be the cause of your intrusive thoughts and the lack of feeling and guilt you're experiencing. ""Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why could we not cast it out?” So Jesus said to them, “Because of your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you. However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.” (Matthew 17:19-21, see verses 14-21 for whole story) This might mean you ask others to fast for your healing as well, but it most certainly means you fast. And perhaps not just from food, but fasting from things that might be idols in your life. Follow the convictions you are given when you fast. 

Also, I dont think you're totally unloving. For you to make this post to warn others shows that you still have love in your heart. That, I believe, is a sign that Jesus is still working in your heart. 

Could it be that the Lord might want to use your testimony to reach other backslidden believers? And that He also wants to use your testimony as a warning against willfully sinning? 

As for your faith--you said you didn't believe in Christ anymore? (correct me if I'm wrong)--there are things that can be done about that. ""So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."" (Romans 10:17) Read your Bible every day. You said when you read it isn't life-giving the way it used to be. Read anyway. You can still comprehend the words in it and be affected by them. God might want to teach you what it's like to struggle to understand the Bible without the blessing of the insight He gave you before. 

Also, remember ""And just as you want men to do to you, you also do to them likewise."" (Luke 6:31) If you try to help others grow in faith, you will grow in faith too. 

Perhaps God is showing you what you'd be like without Him so that you won't take Him for granted again? 

Some other thoughts. Have you made any vows to God that you haven't kept or has He given you any instruction that you haven't taken? For example, in 2011 God put it on my heart to pray for at least an hour every day in the mornings, preferably at the same time every morning. This required serious effort on my part because I've always had poor sleep hygiene and I worked too so time was constrained. I chose not to follow through on that and it is now that I realize God asked me to do this as a protective measure against the backslidding and testing and trials I was going to face. Also, God placed it on my heart to read the entire Bible cover to cover. I didnt follow through on that either. I prayed once and vowed I'd read the entire Bible and so now I believe God expects me to follow through on that vow I made. I was told once that **God does not give new instructions until we've completed the last instructions He's given us.** A friend recently told me a quote that often comes to mind, ""You can either suffer the pain of discipline or the pain of regret."" 

Also, if sin got you here in the first place, then how do you avoid sinning again? This is key: ""For I have hidden Your word in my heart that I might not sin against You."" (Psalm 119:11) Memorize scripture. 

Also remember, ""No temptation has overtaken you except such as is common to man; but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it."" (1 Corinthians 10:13)

More verses to consider: 

“So I say to you, ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you."" (Luke 11:9)

""Blessed is the one who considers the poor! 
In the day of trouble the Lord delivers him;
the Lord protects him and keeps him alive;
he is called blessed in the land;
You do not give him up to the will of his enemies. 
The Lord sustains him on his sickbed; 
In his illness you restore him to full health."" 
(Psalm 41:1-3) Who are the poor? Think of those who are literally AND spiritually poor. How do we remember them? By praying for them and serving them as we're able to. 

“Judge not, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you."" (Matthew 7:1-2) 

""And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart."" (Jeremiah 29:13) 

""I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart."" (Psalm 119:32) God can make your heart bigger when you obey Him. 

Perhaps you are meant to have a testimony of persevering very diligently and for many hours each day to seek the Lord and eventually find Him again. There are likely people suffering tremendously who need to hear such a testimony. People who backslid very far and thought they were apostates but really just needed to seek God with everything they had."

TrueChristian,ex0yd89,t3_cqvbaa,1565925350.0,"Hi, I hope this comment doesn't get overlooked and that you see this. 

First, I want to agree with what others are saying. I don't think suicide is the answer. 

Next, I want to at least tell you that you're not alone, if there's even a tiny bit of comfort to be had from that. Like you, I used to walk with God but fell away and am now schizophrenic and am doing everything I can to not lose hope that some day God might relent and have mercy and heal me. So you're not the only one with the thoughts of being a reprobate and feeling it's nearly impossible to make it back to a right relationship with God. 

What keeps me from committing suicide? I dont want to do that to my family. They still have a better chance at salvation than I do. When you've had a family member commit suicide your chances of doing the same go up. Also, I hold on to the word HOPE. God does miracles sometimes, so why not stick around to see if one of those miracles might happen to me? A miracle might happen to you. Just because there isnt a story in the Bible about someone being healed of schizophrenia doesnt mean it doesnt happen. I've found testimonies on YouTube of people who have overcome schizophrenia through Christ. 

Also, it does talk about, in the Bible, that some demons only come out through prayer and fasting. Have you tried praying and fasting? I haven't yet, so can't say whether it works or not. 

I would be interested in keeping in touch with you if you would feel at all interested. I'll probably PM you too."

Haven't read all your comments, but hope that you do try to keep her in your life and love her where she is at and for who she is, armed with a solid understanding of who you are and your limitations when it comes to helping and being there for her.

exchristian,ewuk9ai,t1_ewuiy9i,1565784063.0,">That is not healthy (in the atheist framework) and theologically incorrect (in the Christian framework). 

Can you explain further? 

And thank you for your comment and suggestions. Is that why you left Christianity, because you read the Bible for yourself? Did you follow Jesus' teachings at one time or moreso were raised in cultural christianity? Just wondering."

Fibromyalgia,ewhmop4,t1_ewhlnr6,1565413257.0,"I see, where there's a strong will there's a way? 

You're right about faith being a belief despite a staggering lack of evidence. I started my whole faith journey because I had tried everything man made to bring me fulfillment or help me and it didn't so I just prayed with earnestness to see what would happen. That's when I had supernatural experiences. They're like evidence in a way though, which is why there are so many people who have faith. God reveals Himself when people seek Him, not always, but much of the time. God is only a fantasy for those people who have never met Him."
Fibromyalgia,ewhl663,t1_ewhkl9v,1565411707.0,"That's true. I guess I just don't normally steer conversations in the direction of philosophy, it just has to come up naturally. That's my main challenge. 

And, just curious from the way you worded your sentence, but why couldn't a reality like the one you describe be an option? Just trying to understand what could be holding you back?"
