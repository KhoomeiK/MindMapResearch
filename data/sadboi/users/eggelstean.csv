Vaccinating is for the betterment of global health and herd immunity. Doctors will modify or forgo vaccination plans given the right information and circumstances. Not everyone can be vaccinated, but everyone who can, should be. 

However, there is one indisputable, biological fact here and that is that vaccines cannot cause congenital genetic disorders, which EDS happens to be. 

Genetic disorders cannot be spontaneously created in your genome. For many, EDS doesn’t present until puberty. The symptoms are written off as growing pains or the inherent flexibility that children have. That doesn’t mean that the EDS wasn’t there though. EDS cannot spontaneously generate."

Paints are pretty coveted due to their unique coloring, however they aren’t necessarily expensive. It depends a lot on their lineage and breeding. I know excellent paints who have been picked out of a slaughterhouse lineup for 30$. Then there are some that are more expensive with well known sires. For example, my horse Diesel is an Oldenburg (a type of warmblood). I’m not sure if his specific cost because he came to my barn as a school horse at a discounted price due to his injury, but they can cost anywhere from the 8,000$ to 50k range depending on lineage. From my understanding, paints cost around 1k to 15k when coming from a breeder.

illnessfakersgonewild,fqs72ge,t3_gkkcjw,1589599989.0,"Okay, because I have some relevant perspective here, I shall be commenting. 

For context, my family are ranchers so I grew up riding and have been in the jumping discipline for the past five-ish years. I also volunteer at a special needs therapeutic equestrian center. We don’t allow riders over 200lbs if they cannot support themselves due to weight ratio, which I will detail later. 

I have nothing against plus-size riders, hell, I am one. However, this woman is far too overweight to be riding a horse the size she’s riding. 

In one photo she is riding a 14.4 hand horse, which is way way too small for her. They might match up height wise, but definitely not weight wise. There’s a specific ratio for rider’s weight to horse’s weight, and if it goes over that can hurt the horse. That 14ish hand horse is just barely over the criteria for a pony (small horse). Let’s say she weighs 275lbs. She needs to be riding at least a 17 hand horse, unless it’s a draft or cob which are made for hauling heavy loads (literally). 

Breaking this ratio can be animal cruelty. For example, I am 5’8 and weigh 190lbs. My horse is 16.3 hands, so our ratio works out and I fit him perfectly. It always hurt me to see people having too much pride to admit that they really shouldn’t be riding a horse that is too small. 

It isn’t a matter of your weight, it’s a matter of the well-being of the horse.

[For example, here’s my weight ratio in comparison to my horse vs. Gina’s. See the difference? ](https://imgur.com/a/PgE9DKX)

The “perfect” ratio in riding is where the rider weighs around 15% of the horse’s weight. Obviously I only have the full measurements of myself and my horse (we have approx a 6% ratio, but it makes up for in height), but given estimation, Gina weighs around 30% of her horse’s weight. Not good."

A girl who was very at risk for self-harm started to cut herself with it. Needless to say, irresponsible. No kids in a group for mental health issues that are increased risk for self-harm or suicide should be given chainsaws, for any reason.

According to my friend, people just ended up cooperating to move through levels because of the consequences if they didn't. It wasn't very effective and she ended up in my program and in another one after that, which were far more successful.

Self diagnosis is really not the way to go. You aren’t protected under the ADA with a self diagnosis and cannot seek workplace accommodations. 

In my opinion, self diagnosis that is shared with others is bad. Yes, I did suspect that I had POTS and the other illnesses I have since been tested for and diagnosed with. But I never claimed to have them before getting a diagnosis from a specialist and I never shared my speculations with anyone.

I don’t know if you are aware of this, but POTS (and other certain chronic illnesses) are starting to be taken less seriously by doctors due to the prevalence of self-diagnosis of said conditions which negatively implants all of us.

Before getting diagnosed with hEDS, my GP just slapped on a HSD diagnosis that partially explained my symptoms and would allow be to use it as an excuse before I could get into see genetics.

Self advocacy and fighting for equitable treatment is great, self diagnosis is not.

I know it can be frustrating because diagnosis is such a long process, believe me, I know. I started experiencing symptoms when I was 11 or 12 years old and it took until I was 16 to get an official diagnosis. The thing is, self diagnosis will not give you more credibility. Wait to see a specialist, get evaluated, and if the findings are relevant, then share them with your boss. 

Personally, my boss only vaguely knows about my conditions because they aren’t relevant to my position for the most part. I wear a medical ID and call it a day there. She’s very understanding, so I don’t feel the need. Sharing a diagnosis, especially preemptively, with someone who can fire you on those grounds is not always the best idea. That’s why I don’t disclose my disability during interview processes. It may be illegal to not hire someone based on disability, but it still happens.

illnessfakersgonewild,fq5ulsl,t3_ggp70e,1589117863.0,"It’s interesting that POTS, EDS, and gastroparesis have become so frequently mis/over diagnosed that they can now be classified in this category. 

All of those DXes have diagnostic criteria and can be evaluated for. hEDS is on the more wishy-washy side, but it still has a clinical checklist. POTS can be tested for with a tilt table test, GP with a gastric emptying study, and hEDS with a clinical evaluation from a geneticist. 

These conditions have real effects on the people who suffer from them that cannot be totally chalked up to psychosomatic symptoms. 

I’ll try and avoid being bloggy but I was evaluated by a psychiatrist before ever getting an hEDS, POTS, and GP dx to confirm that what I was experiencing wasn’t psychosomatic. Then I had the proper tests done and was seen by a specialist. 

The issue is that general practitioners and some specialists are now handing these diagnoses out without doing the testing required. For at least two of these conditions, whether or not a patient has it can be legitimately determined through testing. Either you have it or you don’t. 

It does concern me, as a patient with the “triad”, that malingerers will permanently damage the reputation of those who legitimately suffering. To convert a couple diagnoses from clinically-sound and reputable to thinly veiled diagnoses of functional neurological disorder, isn’t great. 

There is little that is fully known about the cause of POTS and GP. Hopefully more becomes discovered about hEDS so it can gain more legitimacy. 

All around, it’s an interesting conversation to have, but it still stings a little to have these DXs and see them so trashed by people seeking to exploit them."

*Teacher* \- u/eggelstean (yet to graduate high school)

*Student* \-  Bethany (a grown ass adult)

&#x200B;

Bethany’s writing demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic grammatical concepts and writing conventions.

In addition, her prose is often excessively flowery which would be acceptable if the words made sense in context, but instead it appears she has regurgitated a thesaurus.

Since Bethany’s writing has failed to meet the standards for this course, I look forward to seeing her next semester where we will work on the understanding that you cannot take words from a thesaurus if you do not understand how to use them, in addition to appropriate metaphors and proper punctuation.

For the sake of demonstrating Bethany’s writing skills, I shall be dissecting one of her Instagram captions.

&#x200B;

A caption by @rebellious\_story, written in May of 2020.

*“Some time, eventually”* \- The use of two time related words in conjunction is excessive and repetitive. In this context, ""some time"" needs to be one word, not two.

*“In these wordless caverns of society”* \- This sentence would be appropriate if the reader understood what these “wordless caverns” are referring to. You cannot have a metaphor if you have not explained what the metaphor is supposed to refer to.

*“The writer’s stop”* \- Incorrect possession. The stop does not belong to the writer, the writers are completing the action of stopping.

*“A symphony of clanking keys - dissolved into the whistling wind.”* \- The imagery created here is bamboozling. Presumably, the author is referring to “wordless caverns” as mentioned earlier. So from the understanding of the reader, a bunch of writers are holed up in an underground cave where they simultaneously stop typing and their keys dissolve into the wind?” Keys cannot dissolve, as they are objects that physically exist. Wind does not blow through underground caves. This shoddy metaphor fails to further the argument of the author. In addition, there is a use of two different tenses in one sentence which contradict each other.

*“I must... acknowledge the limitations of words and contend with the more fickle arts”* \- Writer's block is not comparable to presumably wearing a wizard hat and squaring up with an unknown method of creative expression referred to as a “fickle art”. To improve this statement, please elaborate on exactly what is meant by “fickle art” and effectively context with the metaphor above (once it has been revised).

&#x200B;

As demonstrated above, Bethany needs significant revision to her written works and must relearn the basics of writing in order to improve her use of it. I look forward to seeing her as my student again next semester.

docs usually try really hard to rehabilitate joints via PT (which builds muscle around unstable joints to keep them in place), braces, etc, etc. 

fusions of any joint will cause permanent restrictions on the mobility the joint the fusion was performed on. 

to my understanding, a fusion is a last ditch effort for a joint that will not remain in place (permanently dislocated) that has failed all other methods of management and is severely limiting quality of life."

FanFiction,folgcin,t3_g7yx4k,1587861634.0,"let’s review the benefits of ao3 and why it needs the money.

ao3 is a not for profit fan archive run by the organization for transformative works. it operates on primarily volunteer basis and requires donations for its internal costs.

so why is ao3 so great and why does it need the money?

ao3 is explicitly against using ads or making any content (or special pro plans) paid for. everything is free to everyone. it is accessible and open source, meaning it is highly customizable. it has a killer indexing and database structure that many other fanfiction sites in addition to academic and professional sites don’t have. the UI is great and can be used on mobile, which means there is no need for an app to be complaint with a specific software. it’s a community space that is very important to a lot of people.

because they are against advertising (which would bug the shit out of people if the site actually had it), they rely on donations for server costs. in 2017, 75% of the budget was just to pay for servers.

due to the quarantine, their site traffic has gone up and they need to mitigate that. that includes changing server configurations and paying for new ones.

ao3 is extremely transparent  with their finances. if you have any qualms about donating, you can see their spreadsheets and their distribution of funds is in the site FAQ.

ao3 is operates with a primarily volunteer staff who conceived of, run, manage and code the site on their spare time.

also, a portion of ao3s funding goes to a legal fund and defense team to protect the rights of fanfic writers if they were ever taken to court for copyright violations.

also, you must realize that most fundraises do not rack up that kind of money in that short of a time frame without a reason. i saw the fund go from like 700 bucks a few days ago to now well over 300,000. you can’t tell people to not spent their money, because it’s their money to spend. ao3 is loved for a reason and people want it to keep existing, especially fandom members who were around before ao3 existed.

(note: to those who debate the morality of having dark fanfiction hosted on the site, please remember that dark shit exits ts everywhere and ao3 gives you the tools to avoid it. it’s up to your discretion. i think people would find it sucks a lot more to be totally censored, like tumblr or ff.net)

also, there are three excellent hot takes on the subject \[[1](https://tehkusogaki.tumblr.com/post/616402266970374144/look-ao3-didnt-decide-to-hold-a-donation-drive), [2](https://sailingthestars.tumblr.com/post/616416660254064640/piroco-marithlizard-hexane-harpy-this), [3](https://sailingthestars.tumblr.com/post/616416656145645568/shysweetthing-callmearcturus-nerd-bastard)\] and [ao3's 2020 budget.](https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/15532)"

Gastroparesis,fn05sua,t1_fmyshvj,1586535954.0,"she must have not been a doc very long then lol. i’ve never had a doctor in the room when it’s placed, only nurses (who have been amazing).

gagging, vomiting, eyes watering, etc is all very normal and reflex because humans evolution-wise aren’t supposed to have things go the way a tube goes.

i know you said this is temporary, but if you do need another NG insertion, these are my tips. 

1. ask for a vomit bucket or bag beforehand because even if you haven’t eaten, you can end up throwing up bile and water
2. ask for a cup of water with a straw. when they start getting down your nose with the tube, take lots of strong, fast sips. the swallowing action makes the tube go down fast (maybe 10-15sec). however, that water may come up again, so keep your bucket nearby.
3. breathe. if you start gagging or choking, do your best to keep breathing in and out. hyperventilating will not help.
4. don’t pull the tube out halfway through insertion. you’ll have to do the whole process over again.
5. when placing the dressing ask for the nurse to put duoderm down first so your skin doesn’t get too irritated. 
6. emotional support is important too. if you want, ask for the nurse to distract you by talking or have someone hold your hand.

post-insertion tips
1. once it’s in, be prepared for discomfort. it will get better. the first 24 hours suck the most. then, you gradually get used to it. i did my best to sleep
after it was placed just to stop the feeling. watching TV is a good distraction. 
2. ice chips, cold drinks, popsicles, etc are really helpful with the sore throat. so is chloraseptic spray.
3. if your throat is too sore to talk, you can use the notes app or the app “statement” in IOS"
