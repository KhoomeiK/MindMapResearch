BipolarReddit,fna241o,t3_g05j7n,1586789541.0,I'm also on 100mg of lamictal and 225mg Effexor. I've been on Effexor for probably 5 years now but only realized last December that I was experiencing hypomania as well as depression. Since then I've been on lamictal as well but I don't think it's helping as much as it should as I am currently rapid cycling like a motherfucker lol but I do think the Effexor helps with my depressive episodes and social anxiety a lot. I totally agree with the other comments though as long as it's working for you don't worry about the dosage and if it's not working well don't be afraid to ask for a higher dose or a different medication
BipolarReddit,fjayacf,t3_fcbw38,1583182907.0,"This has always happened to me. Usually eating something like a granola bar first thing when I wake up helps, definitely don't have anything acidic like grapefruit juice or black tea or coffee before you eat. The best prevention is usually just make sure you're getting to bed early enough, even if you don't fall asleep right away or sleep well just letting your body rest will help prevent it"
BipolarReddit,fi8fn5u,t3_f7045z,1582239397.0,YES that is such a huge accomplishment!!!!!!! I failed out of college a few years ago so I definitely know how much of a struggle it is some days. Keep going you can do it!!!!

bipolar2,fhsqtcj,t3_f4ggym,1581864189.0,"Yeeees almost all the time I believe it's called ""ruminating"" I also get words and phrases stuck in my head that just loop constantly. Sucks when you're trying to sleep :/ I feel u"
women,fggvrsm,t3_eye3bm,1580770659.0,I'm pretty sure they have to make sure it's yeast and not bacterial because the medications are very different and taking one when you need the other can make it a lot worse. It totally sucks that it's such a process too. The last time I went in for  UTI it felt like I was being interrogated lmao
bipolar2,ffsosd0,t3_eusdlq,1580187374.0,"Ive been on Effexor for 5 years now. It helped my anxiety a TON the first few years and definitely makes my depressive episodes more manageable. If you ever need to stop taking it you NEED to taper off very slowly. Withdrawals are terrible I start feeling them after about 12 hours after I should have taken my dose. Nausea, electric ""shock"" feelings down your arm to your finger and in your legs, shakiness, and extreme mood swings to name a few :-) however it has helped immensely in the past so if your doctor says you should try it you might as well. Good luck!! Hope you have good results"
bipolar2,ffsluzt,t3_euvy9h,1580184965.0,"I experienced this last week! Worked a 7 hour shift, came home at 3:30pm and didn't stop moving until like 1:30am when I finally fell asleep. It wasn't even happy unfortunately I was just super paranoid even though I went to like 5 different shops."
bipolar2,ffo17wv,t3_eu9ty0,1580073086.0,Yes I had the same thing for a couple weeks after I started! I would start crying about anything and everything even at work. My emotions were all out of whack but if you stick with it you'll even out!
bipolar2,ff41ois,t3_erdvls,1579553610.0,I'm in love with my best friend/roommate and it's putting a serious strain on both of our mental health and I just don't know what to do. I've been in a depressive episode for almost 3 weeks now and I'm just so tired of trying to keep up with everything. Unrequited love is a bitch!!!!!

bipolar2,fet6tk7,t3_eqk35y,1579372306.0,Listening to music def helps me especially if I'm ruminating or super down. It helps to just pay attention to something easy for awhile

AskReddit,fef9t1p,t3_eoup07,1579051555.0,Idk why but the sun directly hitting my eyes when I'm driving or walking somewhere pisses me off so much especially when I don't have a choice but to keep my eyes open so I can still somewhat see
