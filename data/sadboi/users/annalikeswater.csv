I‚Äôve had my fair share of regrettable sexual experiences...hmm what helps?

For me sometimes talking about it with friends or a counselor has been enough to make me feel better enough. Of course there are still times when I remember something icky and it doesn‚Äôt feel great.

My advice is to be honest and unapologetic about your feelings when talking about it to whoever. Writing about it here is even a form of that! I experienced rape in college, but because it wasn‚Äôt violent, I felt like my feelings of disgust and sadness weren‚Äôt valid. I finally started getting over it when I allowed myself to feel and express my true feelings."
