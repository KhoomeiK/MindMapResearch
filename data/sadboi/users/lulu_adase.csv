I didn’t find the series to be romanticizing SH, as someone said earlier though, I think it was the way how Camille cut words onto her and her case was extreme.

davidlynch,fezvch7,t1_fezrm7w,1579462137.0,"Yesss! I’m a HUGE fan of Kubrick, Gus Van Sant, Lars Von Trier, Tarantino & of course David Lynch! I’ve never seen Lost Highway so I’ll probably be watching that one later today! Thanks for bringing that movie up btw, I’ve heard great things about it just haven’t gotten around to seeing it. I was about 5 when I first seen Stand By Me & instantly fell in love with River. I was so heartbroken when I seen on the news he passed away (I was born in 86) anyway he’s one of the rarest talents ever & I enjoy all of his movies but My Own Private Idaho is my favorite. Great cast with such a beautiful story. Lolita is also a beautiful & dreamy sequence movie and the actor that plays Quilty is an amazing actor. Sue Lyon who played Lolita is so beautiful & she did an amazing job, it’s sad she just passed away the day after Christmas. I also love the book too. It’s a must read. There’s also a book I read recently about the true story about Lolita called 
The Real Lolita: The Kidnapping of Sally Horner and the Novel that Scandalized the World
by Sarah Weinman. Drugstore Cowboy is one of my favorites too. Have you ever seen The Virgin Suicides directed by Sofia Coppola? That’s another really really good movie. It’s also based on a book. I also really liked Gus Van Sant’s Last Days although most people I know didn’t like it but whatever. To Die For & Even Cowgirls get the Blues by Van Sant are amazing. Oh, Drive (2011) is a pretty good neo noir film as well as Neon Demon (2016) directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. Do you enjoy Darren Aronofsky films like Black Swan, The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream, Mother? Those are some pretty mind fuck movies. When you mentioned you enjoyed Suspiria, do you mean the original version or the remake? I personally loved both but the original is better imo. The Original Stepford Wives movie is also a good mind fuck. Birth (2004) with Nicole Kidman is a mind blowing mind fuck! I definitely recommend that movie to anyone who enjoys mind fuck movies like myself. Sorry for the long post! lol I’m trying to think of some other great movie you may enjoy. Also, Jacob’s Ladder...great movie! You have food taste in films!"
