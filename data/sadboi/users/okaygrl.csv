Accept yourself when you’re still within healthy weight range (I don’t mean stick thin just healthy !)

Don’t accept the fact that you’re obese - it’s a disease that leads to other diseases. Promoting it isn’t “acceptance”. It’s like having a lung cancer, still smoking and accepting it because this is part of who you are. 

Stop making up excuses for your inability to stop yourself from overeating, continuing your sedentary lifestyle and sticking to fast foods.

There is an act of environment protection law that forbids to cut a tree that is not disrupting the surroundings, out of nowhere. We won the case and the tree stands still and looks awesome especially in winter. 
He also invited city building inspector to check if everything in our house was legally built. What we didn’t know is that the previous owners of our house rebuilt the terrace on the back of our house without permission. We were clueless but this rude neighbour knew about it since he took a bribed in order not to tell anyone and bring charges. He used this information and years later when we moved in he created all of this fuss to mess with us. We had to do a major renovation but the building inspector was actually also on our side and helped us with all of it.
We’re not loud neighbours, or anything. He is just bitter old man who plays music at 5 am in the morning to mess with us.

Practise your patience.
Go for a walk or for a bike ride near your place.
Try eating more fruits when you need something sweet.
