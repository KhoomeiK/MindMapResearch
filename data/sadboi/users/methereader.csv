My sister is trying to have a baby, and sadly she recently had a miscarriage. I did a 6 card spread asking whether she will be able to conceive in the near future.

From left to right, I got: the hanged man, 9 of wands, 9 of pentacles, queen of swords, 2 of cups and the death.

What are y'all interpretations on it?"

tarot,f3zqiwl,t3_dh9s0h,1571274652.0,"Hello! I would like some help with interpretation.

There was this person in my wife's life that used to be friendly towards her and help her grow in her career path (giving tips and etc), since they were more experienced in the field. They did a few works together but the last one ended with this person having a tantrum over something that did not happen (they later apologized and explained that they were going through some mental health issues). Now today we found out that this person blocked both me and my wife on social media and we just wanted to know why.

The cards I got were The High Priestess, 3 of swords and 8 of wands.

Could anybody give some insight? I'm fairly new to tarot and I'm really struggling to understand this one. I only know 3 of swords as a heartbreak card but I really don't think is the case. The high priestess I also have no idea what is trying to tell me."

All we are allowed to ""talk"" about are problems with anxiety and depression, but people like us with other disorders continue to be stigmatized. When I said that, a girl with schizophrenia and other with borderline agreed with me."

tarot,f2t8upl,t3_de2ei5,1570392014.0,"I'm a beginner and last night I did a spread asking about my relationship. Can y'all help me with the interpretation? 

First two cards were for how is our relationship right now. I got the knight of swords and the 2 of pentacles.

Second two cards were for where are we heading to, our near future. I got the 5 and the 9 of swords. I know this is bad lol.

Third two cards were for what does the universe have prepared to us. I got the 3 of cups and the queen of swords. 

Context: we are ok now, but I have been quite distant because of my mental health issues - which she doesn't really know how to handle. We live together and are having some financial struggles. We have been working through our problems together."

I'm not suicidal anymore, but I definitely feel like other people have a stronger feeling of what ""future"" is or should be.
