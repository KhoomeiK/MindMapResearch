Yeah you may be right, but that‚Äôs not what anyone was talking about. Your contrarian and argumentative mindset had to bring up a counter to a point literally no one made. Most terror attacks are (not were) committed by the right wing. Nothing they said was incorrect, but you just had to find some way to invalidate it on some level. Also the ‚Äúgrow a pair and accept facts‚Äù made it very clear that your intention was to give the right wing some slack.

Literally all of them were on the first page of google as well as being cited in sources in some of these articles. It is not only scientifically supported, but it's scientifically accepted as a problem for certain people when receiving repeated Nitrous Oxide anesthesia. This would also mean that repeated recreational use of nitrous (generally at a higher absolute dose than general anesthesia, i.e a pack of 100 8g nitrous chargers) eventually causes cumulative neurotoxic effects.  

It has a mix of neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects, but the toxic effects generally outweigh the protective effects."
BoomerCringe,fqrdxnb,t3_gkdt81,1589582473.0,"this honestly just seems like a very tasteless, edgy joke. it‚Äôs not a good one, but it a strong front for someone who would make something like this unironically. 

because i know downvotes are coming, let me explain why. the caption is clearly not meant to imply racism. it is meant to imply what it‚Äôs stating. the curveball comes in the form of ‚Äú1937‚Äù and an obvious joke about segregation and african american‚Äôs lack of rights around that time. 

the deadpan delivery, lack of awareness, and obviously racist joke lead me to believe this was made by someone parodying these kinds of memes. disagree with me if you want, but this is honestly how i see it. its my opinion so you‚Äôre welcome to disagree. 

however, this doesnt make the racial implications of the meme any more ok, but i dont think this was made by a boomer. i think it was made by a young person to troll boomers into unconsciously outing themselves as racist. this has happened before when 4chan did a similar thing with kony 2012, by replacing kony with an image of a black actor who looked vaguely similar to kony. i can see those motivations being used to make a meme like this to troll boomers into calling themselves racist.

to me, its an obvious joke that, while not being funny, was obviously well executed and served it‚Äôs purpose well, otherwise it wouldnt be on this sub who‚Äôs sole purpose is to cringe at unironic manifests of a meme like this.

i see that A LOT on this sub. ive seen fucking TONY ZARA (i dont know his actual name, but i know that he is absolutely a satire-based comedian) posts on here with sometimes 10s of comments expressing their hatred towards the meme and their coinciding criticisms of boomer culture. of course, coupled with intense cringe."

The higher the dose, the higher the propensity to cause hypomania. Assuming we‚Äôre not talking about therapeutic doses, but instead recreational doses, it becomes clear. hypomania is a core aspect of recreational gabapentinoid use. this is a very obvious effect based on case reports and anecdotal reports on the internet. the reasonable theory is that the more depressed a person is, the stronger their response to the recreational effects of gabapentinoids will be. there is a direct correlation to levels of stress and enjoyment of gabaergics and i think you can agree. therefore, the more affectively unstable a person is, the more susceptible they will be to this effect in recreational use. again, emphasis on recreational, not therapeutic.

The problem with comparing it to all of those other drugs is that gabapentin's stimulation is distinctly different from those other substances you listed. It has characteristics of hypomania while caffeine, afinils, and even amphetamines generally don't.

These have been known mechanisms for gabapentinoids for years. They are mechanisms behind the psychoactive effects of the particular VDCCs they effect.

There is significantly more evidence to point to these factors being aspects of their pharmacologys and a serious lack of evidence to lead us to believe otherwise.

Their actions on these NTs are the reason both their psychoactive, neuroprotective, and anticonvulsant effects occur.

Also, you pointed out something that doesn't even apply to anything we were talking about here.

>Pregabaline has no involvement with serotonin and dopamine receptors and does not inhibit dopamine, serotonin, or noradrenaline ***reuptake***.

Pregabalin does *NOT* inhibit the reuptake of any of these neurotransmitters, but no one was saying that it did and that does not mean it has no effects on those neurotransmitters. It directly releases serotonin, it does not inhibit the reuptake. Dude, how about you read the article you're using as evidence next time?

This article isn't wrong by any means, but it has nothing to do with my initial reply. What you're doing is spreading misinformation by means of misunderstood evidence.

Based on this, you would be led to believe (by you) that pregabalin ONLY exerts it's effects by means of gaba synthesis. This alone would make pregabalin an incredibly weak psychoactive substance. It's reduction in glutamate, norepinephrine, and dopamine are what gives it it's characteristic high, neuroprotective effects, and anticonvulsant effects.

You have shown no evidence of misinformation in my reply, but you have shown that you cannot tell the difference between inhibition or reduction of neurotransmitters and inhibiting the reuptake of them. Learn that, and then passive aggressively reply with case reports and accusations of misinformation."

gabagoodness,fqlh957,t3_gjg0pd,1589458048.0,"Hypomania. No other way. Gabapentin can be sedating in relative doses, but often it‚Äôs a one-way ticket to hypomania. What I think this may be down to is a reduction in glutamate (what makes most gabaergics euphoric in the first place) and an upstream in gaba synthesis. this combined with serotonergic activity and a reduction in norepinephrine (a nt that has been shown to hold both stimulatory and sedative properties), I think it‚Äôs safe to say that those are responsible. these properties can also cause a reduction in emotional stability (which is weird because theyre prescribed for BPD and Bipolar, but the incidences of hypomania are very high for those people when compared to normal people), which could be the cause of hypomania in normal adults. 

also, the reduction in anxiety is a big one and since gabapentinoids give preferential treatment to social anxiety, it can feel liberating to want to socialize. its kind of an indirect stimulation in that case. its more of an increase in social motivation, reduction of social anxiety, and euphoria. 

Honestly, the gabapentin and pregabalin highs are essentially just hypomania, full or lite depending on the person. I can say confidently that pregabalin in high doses causes hypomania almost every time, especially when mixed with phenibut.

in reality, your body is far more relaxed when stimulated on gabapentinoids, unlike stimulants. its a purely mental stimulation that can easily motivate physical activities. i also think this could be due to the muscle weakness relieving properties of gabapentinoids and baclofen. regardless of how relaxed your muscles are, you feel physically more capable. 

these are all just hunches, but i have researched this myself many times and was left empty-handed every time"

If you believe in certain points, but are put off by an extreme fringe of an ideological group, you probably didn‚Äôt share many opinions of the group already.

StardustCrusaders,fqhd3kf,t1_fqgy4pq,1589374370.0,"I'm only responding to this specific point because I see it brought up *all* the time. 

The reason he's ""super slim"" is because, based on his height and body weight, he was never buff to begin with. I see this a lot in SC fans. They seem to forget that Jotaro is 6'5"", but only weighs 175lb. His most realistic body proportions are in the Part 5 anime. He looks like someone who would fit those dimensions.

Same goes for Polnareff. He was only 6'/6'1"", but weighed just 180lb. Those are not the dimensions of someone *that* buff. Dio, however, being 6'5"" and 250lb, fits his dimensions the best, followed by Joseph (who is still a little too buff). In a lot of the shadow DIO scenes, he looks more like someone that buff, but his proportions in Part 6 are literally perfect. Awakened DIO grew quite a bit, so we can place his weight at around the 260-270lb mark and his height as 1-2 inches taller (6'6"" - 6'7""). This weight combined with this height and muscle mass is a lot more reasonable.

The caveat being Jotaro's proportions. In some scenes, he looks just as buff as DIO and wayyy bigger than Joseph who has 30-35lbs on him and is the same height.

It was all down to Araki desiring to create more realistic characters. He started nailing this in part 5 and absolutely got it down to a tee in part 6. Part 3 did not have realistic characters. Also, there is absolutely no need to have massive characters when they don't even physically fight, and this was clear in the evolution of Araki's art style. In a series like DBZ, it makes sense. The buffer you are, the more powerful you are. In jojo, it has been shown to be quite the opposite. The more powerful the villain, the less comically buff they are.

For instance, the stand power tiers go as follows for villains with stands:

1. Funny Valentine
2. Enrico Pucci
3. Diavolo
4. DIO
5. Yoshikage Kira

If you saw a pattern in the fact that their proportions become more realistic as Jojo goes on, you're correct. Their power is also not dictated by their physical strength. There is no doubt in my mind that this wasn't intentional. In fact, the top 5 most powerful characters in Jojo are, physically, some of the weakest in their respective parts.

There are reasons Araki stopped making his characters buff; it being unrealistic and unnecessary. If you can't appreciate the twink legend that is Jotaro in parts 4-onward, you don't deserve to appreciate him at all."
