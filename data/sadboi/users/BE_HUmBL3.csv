depression,foxlnfr,t3_g9ndgw,1588147933.0,"It feels like you're not living life like we all supposed to . I felt the same way but of different perspective to yours . I feel like a lifeless puppet just to fullfil my own ""part in life"" , it feels like a dream a second you were in highschool , 'blink' you're an adult filled with responsibilities and fullfil your duty which ""no one(even you "" likes or enjoy doing it . I hope one day to ""leave the world"" but seeing how it pains me to leave my love ones' . It hit me everyday if I didn't born , wouldn't they be happy since I wasn't in their lives , I didn't save their lives or give helpful advice like a sage , I just do the same old labour ( cleaning , cooking and study) I'd feel the burden of ""strings"" attached me getting heavier and tighter with every fiber of my body  never in a single day that I missed to pray to God to take my life away in my sleep but to wake up every morning to still be ""alived""but disappointed that I still breath instead of not . 'it' runs automatically everyday (bath eat work etc repeat) , I interpret that ""life"" is a curse not a gift , just to toil and work (even though mankind reach the epitome of tech advancement better than back then) we still suffer the dread , misery of this very ""existence"" yet some of us don't want to ""leave"" because of the fear of the ""unknown"" ,but then again we still look forward to it cuz we could ""rest"" peacefully without a care of the world."
