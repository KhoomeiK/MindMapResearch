I have goals, I have dreams, but how long until I get sick of that too? I wish I could create a community that is self sustained somewhere, with people who are trustworthy and understand what I understand, free of government interference.

Everyone‚Äôs minds are just fogged by greed because money money money, I can have whatever I want. But like, does that make anyone happy? No, it‚Äôs just material. I‚Äôve always said, the debt counter is rising but who is anyone ACTUALLY in debt to? No one, if the money didn‚Äôt exist there would be no debt. It‚Äôs never going to go anywhere but up so what‚Äôs the point in even counting it? No one will ever pay the 3+ trillion dollars of debt the United States is in, let alone any other countries. Not to mention the destruction of our FUCKING HOME. But what does that matter? Won‚Äôt happen in my lifetime, why should I care? People are asleep and you are not so hold your head up.

It is a physical object called fucking nicotine, cocaine, or prescribed anti depressants, all of which are things I will not put into my body. I wish it were easy for us to naturally be happy and find our passion.

One of the previous comments says something about clothes being restrictive, which was similar to my trip. Also, I was really warm. But I think it also has to do with a, sort of, primal state of mind. Also stated above, social indoctrination is pretty crazy.

And understand this: We too lack confidence and self worth.  We too have feelings and depression. Doesn‚Äôt make us any less of men. Some of us just don‚Äôt let ourselves feel because that would make us a pussy. And that‚Äôs a scary thought.
Men and women really aren‚Äôt that much different. We‚Äôre all humans. We all have positive and negative experiences which shape our thoughts. But men are always expected to be strong and never convey these things. Bottling emotions sucks man.
HELP US GET TO WHERE WE WANT TO BE IN OUR LIVES. Rather than deeming someone unworthy because they haven‚Äôt lived up to their full potential. Because one day, that same man may be a huge success. Maybe all he needed was you, someone to provide for and a reason to work his hardest.
