bipolar,feyn06h,t3_equhxj,1579447773.0,"Had a thing with a lovely guy last year but I ended that due to the nature of the relationship and my lack of feelings for him towards the end. I was expecting it to be short-lived since I am aware of my own inconsistencies. I don't think I can hold a proper relationship unless I have a healthy way of coping on my own first. We're getting there. So I think I've been single and ok. Moreso indifferent probably due to feeling depressed (thnx meds). Since then I haven't actively been searching for a partner, much to my friends disappointment, it's just not one of my priorities. I don't think I would want to be in a relationship where I wouldn't be able to positively add to that person's life and vice versa."

bipolar,f9tfpsv,t3_e6smfa,1575621804.0,"I agree with you and one of the other comments. I would say I really do value creativity and see that in a lot of people here. I sometimes regret not pursuing music. Part of why I didn't was out of fear and it made sense when I got diagnosed. Singing for a long time has been something so personal/special to me that I didn't feel like over-sharing about it with people, since it was my coping mechanism and ya emotions are so intensely felt that shit can get real. I didn't want to be criticized on that especially. Any way I don't wanna ramble (yer girl's a lil jittery it seems), but the creativity bug is hard to get out of your system once it's in."
toronto,f8o3u9k,t1_f8fm2w9,1574661747.0,Went a few years ago with a good friend. We both love to dance and joined the salsa teaching they offered before they opened up the dancefloor. Had a great time! Was asked to dance by a couple people. Music is bumping. Going back for my birthday coming up so I'm definitely excited.

Did 97% of my laundry, mom added the fabric softener when I was too lazy to care but I hung them to dry like the heroine I am. Smoked a lil weed. Neck is sore from a massage I got yesterday so I rubbed this liniment oil on it. Smelled good af. Then I also took a shower, cleaned my shower while inside of it haha, and did a face mask. I've been feeling ambitious lately."

bipolar,f2i6hl0,t3_ddfqf4,1570252883.0,You are not foolish. You are not stupid. Don't drag yourself like that. You already know how awesome and strong you are with all the shit you've overcome. Fuck that noise. I'm sorry her reaction wasn't one of acceptance. But you are worthy of it and people like that can go fuck right off!
bipolar,f2i4neh,t3_ddai49,1570252179.0,"I too have ideas like this. Especially through instagram format, I have shared to my friends that I've been diagnosed but I've since archived them when my depressive moods get me doubting myself lol. But don't be like me!! Haha. I think if you're passionate enough to start and consistently produce your content you will be on the right track. More power to ya!!! Podcast style would be great."

BigBrother,eu8bzt4,t3_cf3uzy,1563554074.0,"I know the type of girl Kemi is. In the real world, she is a ""baddie"" and unapologetic in the best sense of the word. She can stick up for herself. And yes I know she has emotions but the only comments I think that will sting a bit are the ones made from Sam, Christie and Holly. Honestly let's not pity her and focus on what they said, she deserves better than that. I know you mean well but the constant repeating of ""how you hate for her to read it"" is just highlighting the negative even though you're trying to do the opposite. Kemi will be fine, and will get a lot of social media spotlight from it to say her peace."

It's a definite productive trigger for me. Happy cleaning!"

Nick can act how he wants but if I knew my line of work was broadcasted globally I would be tight lipped about certain topics to save whatever reputation I have as a therapist.  He seems to try to prove the fact that he's a therapist by diagnosing and trying to critically analyse certain people. Meh. I don't like him. He triggers me lol.

bipolar,ergfo69,t3_c1xfkk,1560837330.0,"Very interesting. I do agree more research is needed to see the affects of antipsychotics in pregnant bp women. Not sure if I am ever taking the child bearing route but if it ever happens to find me, this is something I would be interested in participating in as well. 

I was on seroquell for about 6 months before it got discontinued due to my low energy levels. On valproic acid now and somewhat stable. Best of luck with the research study and congratulations on your baby girl :)"
