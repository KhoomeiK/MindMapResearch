I was put up for adoption at 6 weeks old. I knew from a fairly young age, and both myself and my sister (also adopted, un-related) were very open about this through our childhood. 

At 18, I made the decision to try and get in contact with my birth parents, and got the support of my Mom and Dad to do so. However, after going through the channels with the Register office and others, I was ignored/rejected by my birth parents.

Up until that point, I had no grudges, or hard feelings against my birth parents, and even now, 8 years on, I don't think I could truly be mad at them for making what I imagine must have been a hard decision. BUT, in that moment, I don't think I've been more gutted.
