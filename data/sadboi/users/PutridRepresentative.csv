The UK TV programs, music and the dark, sarcastic british sense of humour.

AmItheAsshole,fmql1z8,t3_fwp5gm,1586301714.0,"NTA. I say this from personal experience. My boyfriend had a childhood friend and I knew they had a history, even though his friend was allegedly straight. Allegedly. Anyway, I wasn't happy with this arrangement, but I wasn't about to tell my boyfriend to stop being friends with his childhood best friend who he had sex with a few times because I'm not that bitch. 

However, they spent time together, and we were together by this point, and low and behold, it came out a month later that he had cheated on me with this friend I was worried about. I blame both of them. I never got the chance to tell him to back the fuck off because I didn't snap at that point but I wish I did.

Put it this way though, it was a me and bf problem, however I was still furious because his friend was very much aware of me. 

Anyway, she sounds like the ""I was his friend before you were"" kind of person which I'm not here for, and she should really find someone else to harass, or better yet, maybe your husband could teach her how to paint a room and then she'll run out of reasons to bug him.

Your delivery could have maybe been better, but I do think your husband is TA because he knows she is romantically interested and she is cleeeeeeearly trying to get him to feel sorry for her so he'd be with her instead - although this is an assumption. Also, you're a health worker, what the fuck is she doing getting him to come over? Although maybe if she caught it'd you'd be rid of her for a couple weeks...maybe I am just a salty ass bitch. But yeah, think you were justified. 

And I don't mind that you took a swipe at her being gross, often times a personality makes a person unattractive physically. 

Also, kudos to you for helping people out there. Your husband needs to sort it out with his friend, and his friend needs to fuck off and decorate her own room."
