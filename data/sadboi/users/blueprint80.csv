Ayahuasca,fqdxqwp,t3_giaamm,1589298422.0,"Really enjoyed your talk Jordon. The biggest hindrance for proper understanding of the experience is that people try to interpret it from the point of the ego, as if they observe something that is happening outside of them and to them, not realizing they experiencing actually themselves. That is the reason why the answer to your question ‚Äúcame back‚Äù as echo. The ‚ÄúI am here‚Äù is not answer from someone else, it is your higher consciousness responding. The idea of separation is firmly ingrained in our psyche which causes lot of misinterpretation. Try to look at your experience this way: you witnessed things about yourself that you are  not able to perceive with your current conscious awareness. Meditating upon this experience may bring  further understanding to you."

In every moment of time in history we perceive ourselves as advanced, whether technologically, mentally or otherwise. The ancient Egyptians considered themselves advanced civilization and ancient Greeks too. The Romans‚Äô probably thought they reached the pinnacle of human evolution and today, we too, are pretty sure that we are so advanced as to draw conclusions about the possibilities of billions of years of cosmic evolution. But how about 2000 years from now? Will the people from that time looking at us as advanced? Will they think that ‚Äúour current scientific fields of physics have been shown to be extremely accurate‚Äù? Maybe. But Galileo was too extremely accurate and worked with top technology of the time. What if we‚Äôre not even biologically evolved enough yet in order to perceive the dimensions that might be all around us? What if our understanding of time as being linear is totally wrong? Then, of course, ‚Äú calculating the likelihood of two or more civs existing at the same time‚Äù is impossible. Impossible with current understanding. I mean, look how we looked 10.000 years ago! Imagine civilizations that may be here millions of years. I wouldn‚Äôt be even surprised if humanity is an offspring of one of them.
So as for the possibility of other civilizations living precisely at the same time as us..maybe with proper understanding of space-time within next 2000 years, this question may become irrelevant same way as question of ‚Äúwhat is at the end of the Earth‚Äù became irrelevant when we found out that Earth is not flat."

WingChun,fp37w4d,t1_fp27h01,1588274632.0,"Second this. This is the most effective way to start. And not only Wing Chun. Yoga, Tai chi, Qi gong as well. Why? The bone structure of human body, in correct stance (or any yoga pose, if executed correctly) is able to support itself with gravity and your breath. However it takes years of dedication to get awareness of this.  Why is a dead body so ‚Äúheavy‚Äù to move? Because of total relaxation. There is no leverage point (muscle tension). If you are able to move your arm with this kind of relaxation (softness) the point of impact will feel the weight of your whole body (hardness). Not because you tensed but because of the speed that you are able to execute the movement. Faster the speed, greater the force of the impact. Muscle tension in this case represent friction. At constant speed, the greater the friction, the lower the force of the impact. This is basic physics."

Another point I would like to make is that today most of the ppl judge crypto by its price. ‚ÄúXYZ is dead because the price went down 80%! The crypto is still in faze of speculation. The price doesn‚Äôt reflect the fundamentals of the project YET,- but only the speculation sentiment of the traders. The real value will be added overtime as the project grows.
