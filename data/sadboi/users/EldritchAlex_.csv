horrorlit,fqwjelt,t1_fqv8hr9,1589706620.0,That movie was crazy (in a good way). I‚Äôm hoping to see more Lovecraft adaptions in the near future.
overthegardenwall,fqwj8mi,t3_gla3j0,1589706441.0,I love this show so much! I watched it back when it first came out and it‚Äôs stuck with me since. Now it‚Äôs a Halloween tradition that I binge watch the series. It‚Äôs amazing and I felt a kind of sadness once it was over.
TsukiAdventure,fqwijg8,t3_gl7tky,1589705695.0,How do I get here?

TsukiAdventure,fqkzeko,t3_gjcucz,1589441002.0,Where is this?
legendofkorra,fqky5hg,t1_fqkx6lc,1589439831.0,This is a great observation
horror,fqk6n3t,t1_fqk64in,1589421162.0,"Yeah I‚Äôm an artsy movie lover honestly, but I definitely appreciate other opinions and I can also see how polarizing films like this can be. So I get it dude"
horror,fqk39ji,t1_fqhz5yw,1589419430.0,Didn‚Äôt know I would be a fan of that style of cinematography but turns out I am now.
horror,fqk36x9,t1_fqhwxcw,1589419393.0,I didn‚Äôt think about the character building too much but now that you point it out it‚Äôs true. I actually ended up liking the demon the best haha.
horror,fqk3059,t1_fqhat51,1589419298.0,"I speak Spanish as well so naturally I liked that side. And I‚Äôve also recently started loving German, it‚Äôs so lovely."
horror,fqk2vug,t1_fqhqbhx,1589419238.0,That‚Äôs fair tbh üòÇ
horror,fqk2qbh,t1_fqhz522,1589419160.0,"I‚Äôm also new to shudder so I‚Äôm not sure. But I would definitely recommend the series channel zero. It‚Äôs an anthology series based on creepy pastas. Only four seasons, 6 episodes each."
legendofkorra,fqk2gg3,t1_fqj0wfq,1589419027.0,"Yes! I loved her in that role, she‚Äôs such a sweetheart but she played an excellent villain. Also she looks a bit like Kuvira like she can play her in live action."
horror,fqh1nfd,t1_fqh194h,1589364728.0,"I actually did enjoy the fact that it was only a bit over an hour. It did what it had to do, I feel like if it was longer it might‚Äôve dragged on."
horror,fqh1k7b,t1_fqgzw0o,1589364641.0,"I actually thought that too, she didn‚Äôt seem like she‚Äôd gone through enough hell (pun intended). I was kind of hoping they‚Äôd have made her more plain looking or tired."
horror,fqgyivf,t1_fqgyd9u,1589361595.0,No way! I had no idea this was a student film. I‚Äôve wanted to major in film for a while now so it‚Äôs pretty cool to see a thesis film excel like this üòÅ

HorrorMovies,foj8z31,t3_g7otzu,1587813090.0,I really loved it. Florence Pugh was an amazing lead. The setting was so lovely. It was beautifully disturbing. I was also surprised that there were quite a few parts that made me laugh (some side dialogue). Overall it‚Äôs gonna be a classic for me.
HorrorMovies,foj8tj9,t3_g7pkmk,1587812920.0,The last of us! It was tense and emotional

mentalillness,fhn23yq,t3_f3zf1u,1581721053.0,"Hey! I‚Äôm not a professional so take everything I say as friendly advice. 

*Try to distract yourself. Listen to your favorite playlist. Look at memes. Binge your favorite show. 

* Accountability. Text/talk to  someone you trust and tell them what you‚Äôre feeling.  Have an open and honest conversation of what brought you to that moment.

*Physical stimuli. Do something else to your skin. Rub ice around. Draw on yourself with skin safe paint or markers. Flick a rubber band. Just make sure you‚Äôre not causing any damage or pain.

Hopefully any of this helps. Things get better I promise."
