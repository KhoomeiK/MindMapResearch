You are legitimate to ask for help! 💙 I'm also always afraid of boring my friends. But you need to be listened to. If your friends or family are not there for you remember that all of us here on this sub are there for you anytime!!

But it's not everyone, to know if someone is really your friend you should not only refer yourself to the time it takes to the person to answer you, because it don't really mean something. There are thousands of reasons.

 But I know it's difficult not to take it personally!

No, YOU are the golden person Monsieur ;) you're very welcome"

AskReddit,fq1b53u,t3_ggghvr,1589043992.0,"Before, I was like you. I was so angry and I did not understand why people disappeared without warning me ""even if I answered very quickly"" as you say. But I gradually realized that it happens to all of us. I swear.

I understand that you are not like me, but personally I accept the fact that someone does not answer me because they does not want. Yes, ""not want"". Sometimes. And there is nothing I can do about it. I can't relate to some of your reasoning because almost all my friends answer me hours and days after, so I'm used to it, but I understand very well!"
AskReddit,fq1ayyb,t3_ggghvr,1589043943.0,"Sometimes I'd reply a day after, and I even ignored FaceTimes sometimes which is maybe mean but I noticed that I do that when I'm very not okay but not because I don't love my friends of course! But sometimes, for some people, it's so fucking exhausting to keep up. I have already stopped talking to my friends for weeks. I warned them that I was not okay and they were very understanding. I think that as long as we are clear on our intentions, there are no problems. Personally most of my friends can welcome me with open arms after such a long time and honestly they are in gold.

It is not forbidden for you to find other friends who are always available. This does not mean that you should throw out your other friends, but if your needs are not completely fulfilled, no one will blame you for going to new people. :)"
