My mom left when I was 8 out of the blue. No call. No letters. No heads up. She ended up being with someone else. 

Almost a decade later she comes back into my life only to be the same manipulative, toxic person she is. She loves turning people against each other, making up lies, and hurting people. I lived with her for about three years thinking i can handle it, but eventually left. Life without her has gotten better since. 

I’m hurt. I feel like less of a person because I don’t know a mother’s love. I feel less because I have this baggage i carry that weighs on me even as an adult. People tell me all the time nothing is like a mother’s love or that she’s still my mom, but... she’s just pure darkness. I’m still learning, but I must say, after years of feeling alone, i’m glad i found this sub. There are people like me, who have gone through what i’ve gone through, and we’re here together.

And there are people like you who extend the love of their hearts."

I have been wanting to post something seeking advice on how to let go, work on myself, find happiness within me, etc but get too much anxiety with the thought. I was feeling sad today, so I was about to post one today bc i needed the support, but instead told myself i should shift my focus on priorities like school work and let the negative feelings go.
