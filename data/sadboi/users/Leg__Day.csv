HealthAnxiety,fr1dk66,t3_glpkeu,1589817836.0,"In the same boat as you and would appreciate any replies. You don't mention which lymph nodes, but mine that I've noticed seem swollen are on the back of my neck by my hairline (occipital lymph nodes). No where else on my body can I feel them other than my groin but I did read that you should be able to feel your neck and groin lymph nodes and they don't ever truly ""go away"".

Something important to note is there's a difference between swollen and normal sized. Swollen to me is that it's easily felt and almost sticking up through the skin if possible? I don't know. All I know is I've become hyper aware of the ones on the back of my neck and I can't stop feeling them. They don't seem big, but they don't hurt to the touch and I don't think they move at all but that could be due to where they are at? The back of the neck is obviously pretty tight and muscle like for everyone, it's not some flabby area you can grab and move around so maybe that's why i can't really move them around. 

Another important factor are the related serious symptoms (constant fevers, coughing non stop, drenching night sweats, etc..) There's so much shit and thankfully I don't have any of that but still doesn't make me feel 100%.

Something else that sucks is that the hospitals where I live aren't really seeing patients in person until June or July, so that fucking sucks for people like me (us). Another thing to add to it all is a lack a routine. All gyms are closed, hell, everything is closed. We can't live normal lives. We are living in the worst time possible to have HA because everything has been stripped from us.

Would love a little comfort and experience/replies if possible."

""hey, I think you're super sexy and I want you so bad, I think about it all the time. Sometimes in the beginning it takes me a little while to get used to someone, that's all. I just want you to know that it has nothing to do with you though.""
