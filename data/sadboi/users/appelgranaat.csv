The first time I did it, we were maybe 6/7 people in total, which already got suuuper chaotic. I was having a lot of fun, and in the end it was a very nice trip, but if there would be even more people, it would be harder to enjoy, I think. 

I didn't have the feeling that I couldn't control what I was saying, I mean, you could choose to shut your mouth. But you can't really control what will come in your head. All my basic logic dissapeared and you get really caught up in other people's logic or in just really random paths of thoughts (for example, we would have a lot of conversations and come to a really weird conclusion, and when we would explain it to our trip sitter it didn't make sense at aaaaall and we started laughing a lot). 

So if you say that you will do it in a close group, that's fine, it's better if you feel comfortable with everyone. For example, in that trip there was one guy joining us that we didn't know that well (it was the best friend of the trip sitter), and he started having a bad trip. So really make sure you're with people you feel comfortable with. And enjoy!
