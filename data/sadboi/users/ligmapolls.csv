SelfAwarewolves,fqfd3w7,t1_fqepzyk,1589322767.0,"How about nobody murders anybody? You should read a bit further. The group as a group does not go and murder people, but individual members are said to have done just that.

I'm all for arming black men. Heck, it's their right. They should go about it and protect themselves if they feel threatened. I would love more justice in that department.

That said, you are a hypocrite for wanting black men in a hate group and whites out of it. I get that reddit is a cesspool of white supremacists. I know you are trying to balance the scale here. Let me tell you, this is not the way. Get a grip."

An anti racist post goes viral, it is found to be of a hate group, mods do nothing about it and instead post nonsense about banning racists in the comments.

I'm all for the message and what people *thought* they were upvoting. 

After thousands of comments calling out the mods for keeping this up, nothing."
TopMindsOfReddit,fqfbe4h,t1_fqf7mjo,1589321914.0,"I have to agree with semtex94. If you're saying there's zero chance a young African-American will be recruited to an extremist group after this group it is you who is misinformed and unaware of the population composition and size of reddit.

That said, obviously a white power type of thing hitting the front page would be a disaster ten or more times the magnitude. That's why people are overcompensating by upvoting a post empowering black people to carry arms without fact checking and then insisting on leaving it up after many comments confirm the men are in fact racists themselves. I'm not against black people arming themselves. I think it's their right and if they think it would be helpful in the struggling they should do it, absolutely. But not like this. Not through advocating for murder, of any ethnic group or otherwise. 

What **should** have happened is the mods realize their mistake and take the photo down, citing why. Of course, that's why we're here. r/pics mods, you are a bunch of hypocrites."
