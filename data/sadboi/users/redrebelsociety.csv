I wanted to say that I have been in your place. But I have also really struggled with that “podcast” of thoughts (great analogy by the way) without medication (& with medication because we all know there is no such thing as a silver bullet). 

But I’ve gone from Adderall, to Ritalin, to nothing. I have struggled for years to manage on my own, develop whatever coping mechanisms I can to maintain any resemblance of focus, but between depression, anxiety and my natural state it is a constant battle and I am tired. 

I also have an idiopathic seizure disorder, so more careful psychiatrists are adverse to *any* ADHD medications. But my most recent psych was willing to try Stratera, which has no convulsant side effects and a low chance of mania at a low dose. This medication has helped me immensely and especially now considered I’m doing all of my college courses online because of the stay at home orders, which is not my learning style. 

So, if you still find yourself struggling in the future, know that there are other meds out there that may be able to help you without the same effects as Adderall. 

Best of luck to you as you continue to make the choices that are best for your body and mind."

Do you really want to be mentally well? Do you really want your parents to help you? Do you really want school to be a priority? 

Maybe your parents are NOT your best advocates in terms of helping you reach your goals and priorities. 

I understand what it is like to feel like you are trapped in a toxic household with people that do not understand you, or seem like they want to fight you/put you down when you try to reach out for help; but when those violent thoughts come, you NEED to fight them. You can not let your anger take control of your life. 

Bite both your physical tongue and your mental one, ask for a therapist/psych, if you have one, get to them immediately. Don’t mention thoughts of wanting to hurt your parents specifically... unless these thoughts are truly ever present and need to be attended to (they really sound like passing thoughts but don’t take medical advice from people on the internet please, including me- I’m just not trying to get you locked in a psych ward). 

But look- I think it would be advisable to put the video games down. Pick up a book, watch a documentary, even if it isn’t about your schoolwork. Do something to feed your brain in a positive way. GTA is violent, video games are not all positive, they may not be all bad, but they definitely aren’t building your brain in a positive way or helping your mental instability.

Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. 4 For he is God’s minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God’s minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. 5 Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience’ sake. 6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God’s ministers attending continually to this very thing. 7 Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.”

Definitely unpopular opinion; I think that the difficulty with something such as an engagement ring/wedding ring/ or the wedding itself and the money ‘invested’ in such objects or an event is the long history of symbolism and representation of that symbol. It would be very hard to convince entire populations of people to forego something so prevalent. Where as a ring may not be required in all societies, and the ring itself is not the same amongst societies where it is considered required (level of expectation (i.e., a diamond ring in western cultures), what it symbolizes- male stability, commitment, readiness, ability to provide for ones partner and soon to be offspring etc., can not just disappear.

However, since I moved into my grandparents home where there are shutters on every window I have come to change my opinion. The shutters are actually much easier to open and close, easier to clean, and the hardware is sturdier and more reliable than curtains.

This may seem a little off topic but this is why we need to do away with tipping, idk why anyone feels they are entitled to extra. WE SHOULD ALL BE OF SERVICE TO EACH OTHER THATS WHAT SOCIETY AND COMMUNITY IS. That’s what it means to have a job. 

These people bitching about the people who are risking their own lives to come into direct contact with the thing (the virus) that all of us are trying to avoid, getting a little something extra for their service is just stupid, they are in an extraordinary situation none of us could possibly understand outside of living it, let them have their free drink from McDonalds.

We should all see service in our selected careers, jobs or circumstances as our duty to ourselves and society’s survival. We don’t deserve and extra clap or snack for doing our fucking job! 

Thank you to all the health care professionals out there, thanks to all the emergency personnel, and yes thank you to all the civic personnel that are still working right now."

worldnews,fksly1l,t1_fksldkn,1584493075.0,"Trial by fire it is, they will be going straight into duty in one of the most stressful times of the 21st century, when all of their family and friends are quarantined. They will be thrusted into the workforce, without celebration and maybe a short period of rest after final exams one might take as they seek job placement after completing their education. 

Some people are so quick to jump into the comments to downplay what’s happening. We all understand, but realistically these are just comments on an article, calm down, we are not there, our eyes do not see and our understanding is minimal, truly. 

So sit down, you didn’t save the intellectual day and the karma isn’t coming your way."
