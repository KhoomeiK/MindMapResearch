trichotillomania,fqp5h2d,t1_fqo6qox,1589535717.0,"It’s a medication that eliminates or reduces the urges to pull! I was skeptical but it really worked for me. It’s definitely worth a shot if you’re suffering. I got mine off of amazon for less than $20, just search N-acetylcysteine (NAC). I take 1200mg/day (two 600mg pills). Good luck!"
trichotillomania,fqo07x1,t3_gjun14,1589504905.0,Have you tried NAC?
ExNoContact,fm07yw3,t3_fs9u6k,1585648291.0,This person sounds terrible. Don't respond - it'll drive him crazy and give you a sense of power and strength you deserve right now.
thebachelor,flzku20,t1_flzhdls,1585626128.0,"She used to have a few pictures (like political someecards) way back on her IG that confirmed she was republican, but she's deleted them now."
BPD,fkshjtr,t3_fk8r4e,1584490238.0,"I was skeptical at first but DBT truly saved my life. I handle my emotions so much better now. It takes time and commitment though. You really have to practice the skills daily, and keep returning to them time after time until it becomes second nature. I'm so happy you've started DBT and hope it improves your quality of life."
BreakUps,fkffahs,t1_fkesmfg,1584133119.0,"This is such a good point, and what convinced me not to reach out. Thanks!"
thebachelor,fkbihse,t1_fk9v1ps,1584033615.0,"She’s admitted to veneers and a boob job, as well. But her face is just naturally super beautiful."
BreakUps,fk6flfo,t3_fgo0no,1583900799.0,Haha you and me both! glad we talked ourselves out of it!
BreakUps,fjznv5n,t3_ffmwub,1583724317.0,"Not thinking about him every day is great progress. You've come so far, don't risk setting yourself back by texting him. Not texting him as an act of self-love and self-respect in this case. Stay strong!"
ExNoContact,fjznluu,t3_ffj4rj,1583724127.0,"You're probably not ready to be friends yet. Tell him you need some time and distance to move on but that you will reach out when you're ready. Give yourself a specific minimum amount of time to be NC (say 6 months, for example) and then check in with yourself at that point and evaluate if you're genuinely ready to initiate a friendship or not."
ExNoContact,fjzn6h5,t3_ffn44l,1583723809.0,"Maybe she was trying to see what you're up to, accidentally followed you, then unfollowed and blocked you to try to make sure you don't get a notification (I've totally done this before). Or maybe she thought she was ready to reconnect, then realized she wasn't and went back on her decision. Either way, stay strong and don't break NC. But you can take a little bit of pleasure in knowing you were on her mind."
Sociopaths,fhyjwic,t3_f5bphh,1581977419.0,It sounds like borderline personality disorder but only a professional can diagnose you. Make an appointment at a DBT center and get the help you need.
ExNoContact,fhyjbvb,t3_f5c0ku,1581977071.0,"Imagine what would happen if he finally had enough and hired an investigator or contacted the police and they traced it all back to you. Imagine all your friends, family, and your fiancé finding out. The shame would haunt you forever, your loved ones would have a hard time ever trusting you or looking at you the same way again. The pain you might be causing him is nothing compared to the pain you could cause yourself. Love yourself enough to quit this habit and protect yourself from the destruction this could bring to your life. You could lose everything. 

Also, I know you want to hurt him but having a stalker is probably just stroking his ego. So you’re not even accomplishing what you want to. 

I say this with complete empathy for you, I know that deep down you just want to stay connected to him and this is a way for you to do so, but you need to think about YOURSELF. You are just harming yourself by staying attached to him in this way. Let go.

Edit: Also, I second the recommendation for seeking a DBT therapist. They’ll have seen this behavior before and know how to treat it. I am speaking from experience."
thebachelor,fgtmnex,t1_fgtlsxz,1581106549.0,Even better.. it was “cut it in the butt”
ExNoContact,fgo6ncu,t3_ezip67,1580961078.0,"You won’t, but the relationship might."
ExNoContact,fggtpbc,t3_ey9yit,1580769334.0,This is the no-contact DREAM. So happy for you!!
BPD,fdsmvjq,t3_emyry4,1578705298.0,"Omg nothing in the world matters more than this right now. I have been stressing all day about seeing my ex tomorrow and right now I’m like “who fkn cares?!? All that matters is that u/itscanimates is alive right now!!!!” Stay strong and keep fighting your damn hardest to stay alive! Reach out absolutely anytime. 

Edit: I got insecure about my overuse of exclamation points and removed some, lol."
BPD,fc0k5ak,t3_efgqu7,1577292681.0,"Yes all the time! I’ll say it even when I am home. Like you, I don’t think I mean my actual home. Just some place I’ll feel safe and comforted."
thebachelor,fbztnso,t1_fbz6wwy,1577260941.0,Can you post/send a pic?! I have curly hair and love bangs and am so curious how they’d look with curls
