mentalhealth,fqhy6l2,t1_fqhv9zl,1589386640.0,"the most important thing you and everyone else in your situation could do is get perspective. this is not forever. your worst enemy (but potentially your best friend if find a way to create an opportunity of quarantine) is time. the lack of social contact affects you more than you think. humans are social creatures!

i know what youre feeling. i miss being happy. i never thought i would have to deal with these feelings i had when i was 13 again. i have these gnawing suicidal thoughts, but i know i wont do anything to go through it because if i just keep thinking about how happy im capable of being. i cant wait to be happy again!! and we'll appreciate it even more now that the virus gives us this frame of reference.

it also helps me to reduce the emotional aspects of the situation down to a science. we're all lacking in a basic human need. oxytocin, the ""cuddle hormone"", is so important to us that it's actually a neuropeptide that not only affects our psyche, but how we grow!! (read Fredrickson's Selections of Love 2.0)

make sure your cousin knows that suicide is a permanent solution to temporary circumstances. this will pass. and if you or your cousin ever need to vent you can always talk to me. its also important that you find some sort of outlet

so basically, try because its only a matter of time until you will be happier than you thought you could be :)"

i cant get over how i mightve traumatized her or how poorly i handled it. she was obviously ""scared by me"" and i dont blame her, but i hate that my immediate reaction was to lie and run away like a child. so we never really did talk about it by the time she moved out but we left it on such an open-ended note that it feels like part of me is still stuck in that situation. i dont know how to move on without correcting this

and the strangest thing is i felt 100% sober by the time i got back ?? im still really confused by why this happened at all and ive gone completely neurotic in my search for understanding :// anyway thank you so so much for your advice!! it really helps a lot to know im not the only one."

so this was unheard of to me and i was completely in denial, so i tried convincing her that i spilled water, but she said i had my pants down

then i had to deal with a very confused RA and cops/emts.

she moved out a week later. i still cringe about it constantly and i just wish i never went back to my dorm that night. i didnt even feel drunk!!!"
