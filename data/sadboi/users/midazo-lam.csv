politics,fr16owk,t1_fr136cs,1589814280.0,"I can understand that there is a wider and broader economic and public health impact imposed by the isolation measures and unemployment status of the country. I dislike when people bring up how many ‘k’ people are dead by car accidents or cancer or heart disease or the opioid crisis because it does not justify for validate the fact that this virus is out of control killing people in this country. The rye alone at which people are becoming infected and dying on a week to week basis blows any other public health death rate out of the water at this VERY minute. Should we care less about those issues? You want me to say ‘no’ but the truth is that trump is making decisions and has been since February that are affecting Americans on a rapid level on a week to week basis. This is right in front of us, right NOW and it will tear our healthcare infrastructure to the ground. ‘Opening up the country’-or whatever you want to call the conservatives throwing the compromised people to the wolves of this pandemic- will result in the same economic devastation, death, and tangential public health issues that would result if the ‘isolation and unemployment’ that you say the democrats want, continues. 

No one wins in either case, but with trumps decision making, his promotion of white terrorism, how he is bullying the governors and disenfranchising public health authorities like the CDC and WHO, we will see the turmoil you speak of at a rate that this country will never be prepared to handle. Flattening the curve doesn’t disappear the pandemic, it slows it down such that the country can accommodate and plan to prepare for the impact it will have on us."
