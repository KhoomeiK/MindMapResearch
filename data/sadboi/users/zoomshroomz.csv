however, if her behind seems to be floating upwards but the rest of her body is facing down, or she‚Äôs actually physically struggling to come down, it‚Äôs probably one of two things: one, she swallowed some excess air and has an air bubble (like they do) and this will pass; and two, she‚Äôs bloated and having trouble pooping. check if you see her pooping or not. 

if she‚Äôs just swimming to the top (not unwillingly floating up) and resting there she may just enjoy it! my axolotl goes through period of time where it switches off between the bottom and top.

Maybe cover the entire tank (including lid) with saran wrap to help both secure the lid and keep the water inside?

I‚Äôd be more worried about the weight than the water spilling. Water is heavy, about 8 pounds per gallon, meaning the tank could weigh over 160 pounds. I guess draining it is your best bet but either way you‚Äôll definitely need more than one person to carry it."
axolotls,fl1ezlf,t3_fly7ia,1584727678.0,"As long as you condition the new water, it should be fine for cycling. Buy an API freshwater test kit to test the new cycling tank.

If you‚Äôre really worried about transferring her, maybe there‚Äôs a way for you to refrigerate her while transporting her? However, I doubt that‚Äôs necessary as she‚Äôll likely be fine in a small tank for two hours while making that trip. 

Is there no way to bring the entire tank with you? Turning off the filter for two hours probably won‚Äôt ruin the cycle... I understand it‚Äôs going to be heavy though and hard to transport."
axolotls,fl0yck1,t3_flwjj5,1584718338.0,"1. Keep the tank out of any harsh lighting or direct sunlight! My tank is actually in a basement, so it‚Äôs away from any windows at all. The basement also tends to be cooler. 

2. Lights emit energy in the form of heat, but LED lights use very little energy so they‚Äôre perfect lights to prevent heating up your tank!

3. Now, to actually make it cooler, use a mini fan!! Many stores will sell very small fans with clips for a low price. You can put a mesh screen to cover the top of the tank which works well as a lid and prevents the fan from falling in/slightly baffles the air flow. Fans do not lower the temperature but they can make you feel cooler. 

Good luck"

If your parameters are fine and your temperature is fine, make sure the flow of the filter isn‚Äôt too strong as it can stress them out. You can get a spray bar or baffle it with decorations, plants, etc. Light that‚Äôs too bright can also stress them out.
