DID,fn9pyn1,t3_fzr4oi,1586781500.0,"First of its lovely you are doing so much for you daughter, ask her about how much you can ask it might change in the future st make sure she always said how much she is comfortable with saying if itâ€™s ok with her try and find out about trauma i know itâ€™s really hard but maybe do research on how to trigger her In the least amount possible.

my Alters all see my mum as their mother but of course that is just mine if you notice a switch the of course Tell them who you are and ask their name they might already know who you are donâ€™t worry as long as you talk to your daughter it will all be fine 

she is so lucky to have a mother like you and it really is lovely you are being so kind and cautious find out triggers because â€˜positiveâ€™ triggers arnt always positive if they bring out an alter that will not do well in some situations that is negitive even though it is considerd a positive trigger as it brings out an alter do research and communication with her is key it will help"

mentalhealth,fioelig,t1_fiocwcq,1582581729.0,i am sorry this is happening to you trauma informed councliling could help instead of therapy maybe try that (i don't know if therapy is that great but cousciling especially truma informed counciling might help more)

mentalhealth,fiod21d,t1_fiocf7c,1582580879.0,thanks for the help! i will have a look into it and talk to the local GP to see if i would be able to go on medication my mum told my i would probably need them anyway so it's not unexpected! once again thanks
mentalhealth,fioco6q,t3_f8yl96,1582580667.0,truma therapy might help but it really is hard to tell keep on trying different things eventually something might work but it might take a while also this sounds bad but after years of counciling or whatever healthy method your using has been going on they will still be there just less obvious i know it sounds awful but it is manageable
mentalhealth,fiobwlw,t1_fioaw7j,1582580248.0,trama has triggerd this probably but i don't really know what i could do to feel better as this has been going on for about 5 years it's just especially bad now as it's no longer just sadness
mentalhealth,fiobka4,t1_fioau01,1582580057.0,no but i do want to look into meds also no therapy doesn't really work for me at the moment but maybe in the future i will start cousciling again. thanks!

mentalhealth,fio597a,t3_f8x0hm,1582576550.0,counting could help you could talk to school safe guarding just ask at the school office and if they say anything be adamant you need to talk alone this could help also any family and/or friends could support you as well if they are going to be supportive same with safe guarding
mentalhealth,fio42fr,t3_f8rtq8,1582575890.0,your not a burden don't worry about that as for your memory i am not sure but the other comments shared some good tips and i don't have anything to add hope you feel better soon
DoctorMike,fil87py,t3_f6hbl7,1582495780.0,idk maybe this happened if it did brilliant lol but also wasting doctors time when they could be seeing someone who needs it ik i am not doctor mike tho!
mentalhealth,fil4cxo,t3_f8f2xq,1582493376.0,"&#x200B;

counciling  could help and talking to a frying or family member might help as well as long as their supportive you might feel bad but they should tell you if it gets too much if not then its not your fault but you can also talk to a GP about it because they might be able to help (not saying meds are needed but it is a possibility and they might help)"
