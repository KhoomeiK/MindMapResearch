Sprint,exms1i3,t1_exmoykx,1566438208.0,"The lease is actually over with sprint, so i wouldn't get an early termination fee, or so i think. I want to turn in my phone, but im worried about if the port was unsuccessful if we could get our money back from metro? Or if it was successful, will sprint know and somehow charge us for having the number ported, or am i wayyy overthinking this? I am feeling a little crazy just because i don't want to have to be stuck with them or have this looming over my head. I have a current ""bill"" with sprint but i feel like it's for future charges and not for current charges as i was always having my service disconnected and then reconnected right after payment, meaning the payment is for the present month"

I’ve been using this app called earnin to keep myself from being absolutely broke, but the only thing that sucks is that it automatically gets taken out of your next paycheck. It’s better than being overdrafted. 

I edited my post to remove the sign up link bc someone got triggered."
