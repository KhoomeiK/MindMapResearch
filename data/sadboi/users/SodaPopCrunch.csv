slowcooking,fo1z3kn,t3_g58yxs,1587445060.0,"Due to my living situation, I don’t have access to a stove or oven. I finally invested in a slow cooker and made a meal for myself for the first time in a long while! I know it’s not much compared to a lot of the posts here, but it was heaven to me. Though I might add more seasoning next time."

medical_advice,fm6e1zj,t3_ft8kp0,1585792009.0,A wart! I had one when I was in middle school and just cut it off with nail clippers. Had to get the “roots” out so it wouldn’t grow back.
medical,fm6df5d,t3_ftdcva,1585791611.0,"For as long as I can remember, these two spots in my feet have always hurt whenever I press on them, bump them into something, or even just tense them up. The rest of my feet normally feel fine. But for over a year now, they just ALWAYS hurt. The pain ranges from an annoying, dull pain that I can almost ignore to an unbearable pain that makes me want to cry when I walk or run. It also seems to act up when I first wake up or stand after sitting for a while, I’ll have to walk around for a few minutes before I stop limping. But they also become super uncomfortable from standing or walking from long periods of time. I’ve tried switching shoes and trying different insoles in my running shoes and work boots, but they still ache. Icing them doesn’t help. Running less often seems to help, but doesn’t relieve them completely. Any ideas?

Edit: The circled spots in the picture are generally the only parts that hurt."
plantclinic,flixg06,t1_fliug6m,1585193123.0,I poked at them to see if they were mushy and they slid right off the plant. I will report tomorrow with a mix of cactus soil and perlite to see if that helps!

Since then, I’ve become super invested in them and they’re my main hobby.  I check on them several times a day to see what kind of maintenance they need and have started researching what I need to do to sustain a healthy terrarium.

love,ffrzevl,t1_ffrwfpb,1580169416.0,"We’ve had that conversation before. His friends actually warned him at the start of our relationship that he should reconsider dating me because I had a bad relationship before him and they thought the two of us would have the same problems. I’m very happy he didn’t listen to them and that they’ve come around since then. I do feel that with most other men who don’t share my partner’s “I’ll do what I want” attitude, friends’ opinions would carry a lot more weight."

I agree that there are plenty of people with poor intentions that we need to be wary of. In your opinion, is it possible for someone to prove they’re not one of the sociopaths and psychopaths, or is it even worth the effort to try to find out?"
love,ffroffb,t1_ffrauih,1580162275.0,"He isn’t “someone that could potentially replace [my] partner,” he’s a mutual friend that we both trust. Not every man is a potential replacement for my boyfriend. In fact, no man is. My partner didn’t just tolerate my decision to ask our friend to a movie, he fully supported it and suggested I get lunch with the same guy afterwards. The only judgement about my faithfulness that means anything to me is my boyfriend’s, and he has absolutely no problem with it. It’s silly to create an imaginary problem when all parties involved are on the same page and okay with what’s going on."
love,ffrdz9c,t1_ffr4c55,1580156132.0,"He was on several medications and was ordered to see a therapist twice a week. He spent a good amount of time in the hospital recovering from a brutal suicide attempt. Somebody who worked with him mentioned to me that he had been making some concerning comments, so I invited him out to check up on him and see how he was doing. I’m not particularly close with him, and he has his own girlfriend now. He never reached out to me- I reached out to him out of concern. Why don’t you believe it’s possible for me to be around another man without either him or myself trying to pursue something my boyfriend wouldn’t approve of?"

love,ffqt3gs,t1_ffq9gov,1580143017.0,"I understand that there will always be someone who is “better” and that realistically, had I never met my boyfriend, I probably would have been just as happy with someone else. However, I love him more than anything. Even if I meet someone who is kinder, smarter, stronger, or whatever else, I just don’t care. I found someone who I’m utterly devoted to, regardless of who else walks into my life. It doesn’t matter if I meet a “better” man, because I don’t love that man. I love mine."
love,ffqpdcp,t1_ffq9k5z,1580140522.0,"We’ve been dating for a year now. It’s not that he’s uninterested, he just understands that I’m capable of being near other men without trying to sleep with them."
love,ffqote4,t1_ffq3nkk,1580140141.0,"He’s more than welcome to hang out with his female friends, but he doesn’t have too many. There aren’t any women in his workplace and he usually only hangs out with his work buddies.

I never claimed a movie will solve suicide. He was struggling with loneliness and isolation, so I invited him to go see a showing of a movie we both liked and to other group events as well as just talked to him about his struggles. Just showing someone that they are wanted and welcome can help and is better than ignoring them."

justdependathings,ffiw4a8,t3_etqaok,1579984129.0,"At my first unit, all the wives absolutely could not stand me. They didn’t want me talking to their husbands and were very distrusting of me, so I generally didn’t hang out with the married Marines. It didn’t matter if they had actually met me or not- they saw me a threat simply for being a woman who worked with their husband. They would ignore me if I was around, and I later would hear from the people I work with that their wives were calling me “slut” and other similar names.

At my current unit, I actually get along really well with everyone’s wife. We go out frequently, with and without their husbands. One actually admitted to me that she was initially nervous when she heard her husband would be working with me, but now she invites me out with her and her husband all the time and we have a blast."
