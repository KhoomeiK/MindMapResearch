You are not helping anyone by cheerful nonsense. In some, but not all cases, not even heavy medication and years of therapy helps. No, strangers telling you to cheer up is not going to help. On the contrary, if you're truly in a bad place, it can have the opposite effect. This is not a place for do-gooders to ""help"" people, because they can't, but rather for people in need to come and vent. Just knowing somebody is listening and understand what I'm talking about is way more helpful.
Each and everyone own the right to their life as well as the right to their death, and you can rarely say someone is truly better off hanging on to a life of misery.

They are usually easy to tell apart. Direct your ""don't worry-be happy"" shit towards those. The rest you could well drive to act upon it sooner than they intended.

Most of those who are crying their eyes out over someone who killed themselves, are really only crying about the impact it had on them. Bottom line is, suicide reminds them of being inadequate as friends or family, and also of their own death. Which is the real reason suicide is seen as a terrible thing. If you're really depressed and done with life, there are no moments of happiness, nor any reasons to wake up. Everyone has a right to their own life as well as to their own death. Trying to hit others with your own naive optimism is not helpful at all, but rather the contrary."
