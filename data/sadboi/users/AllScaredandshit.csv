People value things that make them feel nice for no other reason than it makes them feel nice. And that varies wildly from person to person, and even day to day for any individual. You should not measure your worth this way. All you can do is give your own life value and meaning and it can be whatever you want.

I'm in therapy and my therapist is helping me untangle my screwed up sense of self and general hatred of myself. It's taken years to even get where I am. The most important thing she taught me is that losing weight isn't going to fix all my problems and there will always be something else to hate and want to destroy. The key is self respect and self love. Especially for children and impressionable people. Instead of being creul society needs to show them how to respect themselves and make healthy choices. Like for example dancing is great excercise and should be praised if a fat person wants to dance. I work with vulnerable people and actually care about people's health, mental and physical. Everyone should lose weight but no one should hate or be ashamed of themselves. If you want to publicly shame people you are an active contributor to the problem and it's really dishonest to pretend otherwise. You just want to feel superior. You should probably seek a more positive outlook on others."

They were just examples. They weren't about me personally, but you can't possibly know what makes someone's life worth living, like, idk a globe trotter who lives to travel. Should they travel less? Yes. But I understand why that would be difficult to do. Not to mention people who are already struggling substantially in life already, of course they're not going to want to do things that are more inconvenient. Being overly critical of people's lives doesn't help, calling people lazy and being judgemental makes people double down and acting like it's not really a big deal because you were able to do it will get you nowhere with them.

We're mostly in agreement anyway, but  people need to relax and be more gentle/understanding if they want to get through to people who are stubborn.

Not every city has a reliable public transportation for example or they might not have one at all, of course people in those situations would drive.

My point was that it's better to say fly less, eat less meat, drive less then tell people never fly, go vegan and never drive.

BingeEatingDisorder,f4vnoq5,t1_f4uohlz,1571845143.0,I'd say maybe 40-60 grams depending on the day. I eat a lot of chicken and eggs and a little cheese/nuts. It's hard to find protein I like that's also healthy and if I eat too much meat I feel kind of dirty so sometimes I cut back but I want to eat more seafood too.
BingeEatingDisorder,f4ub5v1,t1_f4snz0j,1571804286.0,I second this. I was on keto for a month and honestly it was part of the reason i started having resurfaced thoughts. It was too hard because completely healthy foods that were staples for me like brown rice and apples were basically off limits and I slowly became more obsessive till I crumbled.
AmItheAsshole,f35nhvr,t3_dfiyzz,1570683011.0,"ESH i think. The way you word things can be important to how people will react or feel about them, don't pretend tact and context don't  exist or that different words aren't perceived differently. ""I'm sorry I didn't mean it that way, I meant X"" can go a long way, especially to your supposed close friend. 

I agree with everything else you said though. I also work with vulnerable populations and this mindset is unhealthy and she is already favoring her daughter over her son."
AmItheAsshole,f35ljju,t3_dej40v,1570681344.0,"Honestly your edits just make it worse, it's kind of pathetic. You obviously just want someone to pat you on the back and tell you you're right. Don't come to the jury of your peers if you can't accept your judgment."
AmItheAsshole,f2wmdhv,t1_f2w7kf7,1570467501.0,"YTA. 5 days without eating, especially on a monthly basis can harm you in the long run and cause issues to your body as you age. You obviously don't understand the systems of poverty and how many obstacles that are in place that prevent people from getting out and talk about this woman like some kind of repulsive pest. What if she collapses from hunger at work and gets more dept from being hospitalized? How will that help her stop ""being a burden"" and improve her life? You don't deserve to be married if you can't even respect your husband's immediate family and tbh you should probably see a therapist to help you empathize better because holy shit."
news,f0apryz,t1_f0akvm8,1568517466.0,It's not inaccurate. Your frontal lobe doesn't finish developing until you're around 25 and it is literally the most important structure in regards to impulse control. If someone's frontal lobe were to be severely damaged even if they understand they shouldn't do something they probably  will still do it.

news,ey6rvtk,t1_ey6invo,1566862543.0,I am the pickiest person I ever met and it's pretty obviously not like a meat to me but it's still really delicious and I'm happy to eat it. Other vegan beefs are nowhere close to beyond/impossible.
Indiemakeupandmore,ex2brjs,t1_ex11r5z,1565966509.0,Good to know. Thank you!
depression,epy322v,t1_epxtd2t,1559617864.0,Thank you I will!
depression,epxmxix,t3_bwf8tg,1559605167.0,Hey somebody saw one of my pictures on social media of me at a party and made fun of it calling me a walrus. Some people need to feel superior. Losing weight might make people treat you better but honestly if they treat you like crap when you're fat their attention is not worth it. I wish you strength on your weight loss!
UpliftingNews,eptgxav,t1_epsx2zw,1559489964.0,That's like an entire liter of blueberries a week.
depression,epqcbu2,t1_epq7gsb,1559403402.0,My friends boyfriend (he's gay) is very fat and they're in love. I'm also fat and people used to like or ask me out when I was fun and less depressed but now they're all gone. There is a push to be fit in both straight and queer circles but to say you can never find love because you're fat is not true ! It's hard but people are out there. If you can you should take to a therapist maybe there's other reasons dating seems hard for you.
