I am glad you focus on your kids and keep fighting on because of them. However, you now need to focus the energy to yourself and try to build yourself up, off the top of my head I can find 5 great things about you from your own text
1. You are a great parent
2. You work well, as you didn't attain your status by just sitting
3. You care about other people, you create accounts to check up on your comments to check up on what people say and feel about you.

4. You take your stand, you don't become a controversial celebrity if you do not have firm beliefs that you follow despite what the mass population thinks.

5. You look forward - this means you are focused on your future, that of your kids, people's reaction....


See, from that one text. You can do this exercise for about a week, write down five good things you know about yourself. Focus on your journey and see the ups for a while, after you feel better, you can now approach the negativity out here and find a great coping mechanism that suits you."

First, I'd like to urge you to keep the communication open in terms of creating a sharing environment where it's okay to tell each other how you feel but take it a step further and ask yourself why you think you feel that way.

During this quarantine time, most people are bidding heads cause as it turns out most of us don't play well within confined spaces. So in terms of pointing out little annoyances from him, find positive coping mechanisms such as finding fun indoor stuff you'd do together, finding 5 good reasons why you like the guy... You know... Stuff like that..

Lastly, find areas to steam off especially through vents and chats as you did, it really helps you maintain a level-head when talking with him.

Thanks for reaching out😊, allow stuff to work out, ease yours into the relationship and all will turn out well"
SuicideWatch,foldg1p,t1_folcs1k,1587859877.0,"Well I can imagine all the scenarios you have gone through in your head on the difference any action you would have taken would make. However, this bars you from actually accepting what happened and moving on with your life. It also kinda projects the pain and hurt into something else.

I would urge you to find a way to get through this. You can sought of write a letter to yourself with all the things you thought you could have done to make things better. Then go through them and forgive yourself for that. Then write down the statement I forgive  you (your name) for the death of (their name). You should say it mentally first then repeat it to yourself.

1. You work with your own schedule
2. You don't have to move around especially with the lock down and curfew
3. It works more or less like a phone conversation with a friend so its easier especially cause you had a bad experience before.
4. It's accessible cause all you need is a device and internet.

You actually have discovered that you used work as a coping mechanism and now you could Amp it up to suit you, thus making it a positive coping mechanism.

Here is an idea, find some cool project that you feel good about doing, involve some of these people you want in your life to do it with you, make it casual and not serious. What this will do is give you something to work on together, hence a chance to communicate and grow whilst doing something you like.

If that doesn't work or suit you , you could brainstorm some alternatives and implement them. Good luck. And you always are important."

However two other lessons stand out, You learnt your own value and how you want to be valued and allowed yourself not to settle for less, in this way you managed to reach out to yourself and really feel your worth.

Now the conclusion should be, continuing the learning curve on how you want to be valued, how you want to love and what you'd like to do, then do all this to yourself. After isolation I promise that you'll emerge stronger and will have created a space in your life for people who can value you as you like to fill.

I would especially like to point out the point where you said you are reaching out to your family more and you feel more connected while actually not being physically present. This is a good trend in terms of identifying some of the techniques you are using now and continue implementing them later.

Another thing you'd do is just to play out the scenarios you post-lock down that you think will give you social anxiety and try to plan a counter for them now by either learning new coping mechanisms or planning around the activities.

Also, I'd ask you to be keen on online  communication with others now so that you could limit the excitement and awkwardness that will come post the LD, in my opinion.

We could actually discuss and explore more coping mechanisms or counter measures you guys would like to implement that will help many people that will potentially be affected"

Maybe do some exercise something that will make you focus on the activity  rather than brain stuff, plus something that will make you tired so that you can sleep from exhaustion and not stay up pondering the situation, probably watch something interesting.

Ummhhh... You said you dated for 9 months and were best friends for 2 years right.... I am sure you guys broke up sometime ago...

So here goes, it is your ex's current opinion of you, but wait a moment,  no one can stay voluntarily for 2 years and 9 months with a bad and toxic person, I sure cannot and you can't too.

So I'm sure it has something to do with you two breaking up and also the jump from best friends to lovers to now exes adds on pressure to the break up.

Other friends tell you that you are a good person, but as you've pointed out most likely that your ex prolly knows you better than any other person. But there's one more person who knows you better than them. Yourself.

Do you feel like you are a bad person, from my first impression of you via this text I'll respond to my view of you regarding you being bad:

Do you think a bad person would beat themselves up and feel bad because other people say they are bad? DO you think they would be interested to know why someone said that and try to correct where they went wrong? Do you think a bad person would wanna express themselves to know whether they are bad?

I think not.

Gove your ex a chance to cool down and heal, know your own goodness, revel in the good times you had for the 2yrs and 9 months and know they'll come around, but meanwhile pay them no attention anymore as that will hurt you more...."

So it will really be determined by how we as the world will respond to it, some countries have been successful in its containment and others haven't.

2.Yes the mortality rate for ages betwee 0-10 is the lowest and below 50 the rate is still below a percentage. However, it would be better to not get it at all because we have seen the cases of young people dying too especially ones with unknown underlying conditions and some were even health fit individuals. So your best bet would be to keep yourself free of the virus by following the guidelines offered by your medical provider and your local government.

3.Yes, the transmission rate is the primary cause of panic and lockdown, because, in as much as people recover, any place around the world lacks the medical capacity to contain an ever increasing number of outbreaks as seen with the corona virus, there is a chain reaction spread which is worrisome and the more number of people infected translates to more people needing medical assistance and more deaths...

I'm glad that you are free to express yourself here and I'm also glad that you allowed yourself to interact with people on Tinder and talked to someone seriously. Thats amazing. 

Now I do understand what you mean about not having ' real friends' in campus and the dating bit. I'm thinking that first of all you'll need to take baby steps back to the safe space where you are willing to try to put yourself out there again.

I kind of have some pointers...
First off, get an online confidant, someone you are comfortable with to just kind of communicate to throughout your day. But don't dive straight into the deep end. Just make it light and casual communication. I can be that for you 🖐️. 


Then now implement the casual manner slowly into your daily life. Let it be a game, where you are kind of interacting and vetting people you'd want around you.  For example, you'd set a goal with you and your confidant that tomorrow as you go to school you'll just say a random hello to four people without really expecting anything back. 

Then y'all can discuss how challenging that was and how it made you feel and the response if any, from the greetings. 


The point is slowly bringing the power and confidence to you by approaching the situation step by step.
