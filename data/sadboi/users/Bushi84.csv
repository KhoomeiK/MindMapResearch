NoStupidQuestions,fno8qt3,t3_g2yl13,1587116370.0,"You cook in large pots so few hours at the kitchen is enough for at least four to seven meals.

You freeze what you can to thaw it out at the moments notice (chicken, soups, bread, whatever).

You do shit that is easy to cook from pre made ingredients and you buy stuff you can just warm up and eat.
Sandwiches are usually a good choice also.

Stuff like frozen fries with frozen fried chicken is a life saver, just put both of them in the oven and have a meal in 30 minutes, I mean even pizza will do.

As to the cleaning, I optimise not to use too much dishes and pots (Like eggs can be boiled in the same pot sausages were just boiling in). 

If I am making raw meat I dont keep it in one bowl then wash and put it in the other then put it on cutting board and then on the try after covering in spieces from at least 20 other containers.

I just fucking wash it, dry it, if I need cut it and put instantly on the oiled try on which I put spices on it and put it into the oven, put the wet paper towel used for drying it and other waste into container the meat come with and dispose of it instantly.

If I am making something in the oven I often just pull this stuff out with the frying foil, put it in the plate like this and dispose of the foil afterwards (easier cleaning)

But yeah, here is where a dishwasher comes in handy, you think you are too good for a dishwasher, you can wash stuff by hand (or your  mom/gf/wife) will? Well then, now you know, have a large one also unless you want to save on a size now and wash dishes after every meal every day afterwards.

A large dishwasher can keep at least a few days worth of dishes if you live alone.

I also usually wash everything I was just using so it wont accumulate, using only one dish, one set of utensils and one cup for daily use help to avoid mountain of stuff in the sink."

Even more seriously, sex is such a major part of human live, its our instinct, its programmed, people fuck with other people just because they have an itch, nothing better to do.

To the point it become so disruptive that we have to come up with punishment for people who go crazy without it like rape, incest, zoophilia (Yeah, many dogs got more pussy in their 12 years of life than his uncle in his 74), paedophilia (that alone is pretty much an industry by now, you have sex tourism to philipines, ppl sell cp vids on the dark web, the whole church and molestation thing, Hollywood and molesting thing).

The sex is in adds, movies, music, health mags, horoscope, there is a whole history of people fucking and those people made a history just because of their ability to get laid, I mean I could really go on like this for hours but, lets just say the obvious.

If, his life was lacking thing as basic as intimacy, I can say with a certain degree of confidence that many other avenues of his life were closed to him no, not even closed, he was never aware of their existence, he might have hope but still...

That as far as his relations with other people went, telling a joke next to a water dispenser at work not realising that people stopped for water and not for him.
