I understand that they are clinically proven (be they selected proteins or hydrolyzed diets), I've just been burned by vets claiming that (in this case my former cat) couldn't have been reacting to them but she was.

As for named fats/natural flavours I was trying to say that it's happened to me more than once that an unnamed 'natural flavour' turned out to be chicken based. ""Animal fat"" as you know can be pretty much beef or pork or anything non-poultry and having an animal with severe allergies meant I wasn't willing to take the risk.
I find it interesting though that you support the d/d but hold this view of 'natural flavours' when 'natural flavours' show up on the ingredient list. Like I said I've written to more than one company (boutique or not) and found out their supposed LID chicken-free kibble had natural flavours from chicken thereby making allergic responses possible.

I also never said the hydrolyzed diets were unsafe? I understand what they are, just said that it is still possible for the hydrolyzed protein to provoke an allergic response.

We're working on getting my current dog tested but running into issues as the dermatologist really wants to do skin testing instead of a blood test but the dog has had an anaphylactic reaction to vaccines before and is brachycephalic so neither I or my vet want to risk it."

Honestly I find harnesses a lot more secure. If they're correctly fit and the right style they're a lot better for avoiding injuries and (I feel) give better control.
If you have a reactive dog they also avoid the ""see trigger and get yanked on when I react"". I see a lot of folks constantly tugging on the flat collar or just getting dragged by their larger dog.

You're right though enforcement is a whole other issue because I still see folks with flexi-leads and large dogs on only collars and I even still see choke collars etc sometimes too."
dogs,fr1woyd,t3_glvi4e,1589827201.0,"It's hard when you have had your trust broken by a vet.

I had a cat with *wicked* allergies and resulting GI symptoms and eosinophilic granuloma complex. Vet kept saying it was behavioural and when I kept pushing they relented and recommended Hill's z/d. Cue 12 weeks of diarrhea, hair loss and lethargy. Kept being told that ""it's impossible that its the food, it's hydrolyzed and proteins are the problem, not grains"". Except that hydrolyzed proteins can still sometimes cause reactions.

I got fed up and took her off the food.
Went to another clinic for a blood allergy panel.

She came back allergic to (in addition to a variety of environmental triggers) chicken, rice, potato, barley and flaxseed.

Trying to find any sort of grain inclusive ""mainstream"" brand that had named fats and natural flavours and the quality control to know that the ""animal fat"" would consistently not be contaminated...was near impossible.
I couldn't afford to feed her the canned Hill's d/d duck exclusively (the dry had chicken liver flavouring she reacted to). So she ate a grain-free food.

My current dog is much the same. I can't afford to do the veterinary diets (he's 60 lbs) and am wary of the hydrolyzed foods anyway due to my past experiences.
I tried a grain inclusive food with as much of a limited ingredient list as I could find buy that also included chicken fat. I just hoped that just fat wouldn't cause problems but he just had diarrhea for weeks on end. But he's struggled anytime I've tried to offer grain inclusive treats. Until we can get him allergy tested I'm just trying to keep himas comfortable as I can.

Am I scared of DCM? Absolutely. But right now he eats a duck based, grain-free food because I have to keep him stable.

I will also say that it wasn't really about the trainer. There's all this learning and practicing and reading that *you* need to do to develop your skills. The trainer doesn't walk in and fix your dog. Really they are there to teach you and give you hands-on help.

Dogtraining,fqt5r34,t3_gkos7q,1589630824.0,"So, what you have is actually an obnoxious dog who is lacking in social skills and who is overexcited/reactive.

A one year old dog who rushes directly at a dog and also keeps going even if the other dog is sending ""back off"" signals has poor social skills. Even dogs who are very social with other dogs will take to this poorly and it doesn't make them ""aggressive"" for doing so. It's the dog equivalent of an adult human running up and tightly hugging a stranger they don't know and to just start talking at them.

You might tolerate it in a very small child because they are too young to know appropriate social rules, but another grown adult doing it is weird and likely will get a very negative and defensive reaction.

You need to keep your dog leashed. Really honestly unless it's a designated off-leash area or secure fenced yard he needs to be on a leash. This is especially true until he responds reliably to a recall cue from you even under distractions/exciting situations.

It's not cute or fun to be rushed by an off-leash dog. It's also dangerous for him as he could get hurt, be it by a wild animal, a person, a car or another dog. Sometimes people have fears or are with small children or are elderly/disabled.

I have a dog who became reactive with other dogs precisely because as he was growing up he got rushed by too many obnoxious dogs with no recall. When I've had to scream at and fend off unruly dogs by whatever means necessary it is not my fault, it is the owner's fault for not controlling them.

First: the harness you have is ""poisoned"". You have created negative associations. 
Get a new one (preferably another style that you do not have to put his legs in).
From there, start slowly. Maybe the first session is just ""every time he sees the harness he gets treats"". Then you move one tiny step at a time. You don't bring the harness to him, you let him choose to come toward it and eventually put his head all the way through the neck portion. If at any point he backs away, let him go.

I am not sure due to his breed and stigma plus the relative stupidity of local dog owners if I would ever let him be a dog park dog. Likely not. At this point we're working towards polite avoidance/disinterest with other dogs so he can cross them in the street nicely etc. If he can do that then his world opens up quite a bit. We can go for walks in forested areas or to the beach.

If I had more faith in local owners that they'd be careful to introduce the dogs properly and not just let their overexcited dogs rush into his face on their flexi-leads I'd be more interested in him making local dog friends.

Once things open back up in terms of COVID-19 the trainer plans to help me test him with a bombproof dog in an off-leash situation (with muzzles and other safety precautions in place).

But in general I don't let him meet new dogs. He also can't be vaccinated so there's that (he goes into anaphalaxsis and collapses from one/all of them---we don't know which one was responsible and we're not about to test it).

The other thing is that unless your dog has randomly developed a brain tumor or you have severely punished the dog for growling there are *always* signs prior to a bite. Always. Dogs talk with their body language and there are many subtle signs of ""I don't like this, I'm scared, stop, go away"".

You cannot expect *any* dog to be repeatedly put into a situation where they are stressed/harassed/scared by children (particularly young toddlers like yours! they are often very stressful to dogs) to not eventually bite after the other communication is ignored.

Is this your sons fault? Of course not. He doesn't have any of the mental faculties to behave properly with the dog. But the dog is also not to blame as it is only a dog with the ability to think and react and communicate only as a dog.

But that's where you come in.
Absolutely it is worth consulting a *qualified* veterinary behaviourist and/or a qualified positive reinforcement trainer (ie look for the letters after their names that they've studied and graduated from accredited facilities) to see what they say about whether or not the dog could stay.

dogs,fpe8iwa,t1_fpdq21r,1588542485.0,"It's really not.
People muzzle train their dogs for all sorts of reasons, some of which have nothing to do with any aggression.

Some dogs have a high prey drive (greyhounds for example---they're also commonly muzzled when playing together as their skin is fragile), some dogs eat poop or rocks or trash, some dogs are reactive or have fear issues.

Muzzle training after an incident occurs is like closing the barn door after the horse has already ran out.

My boy has never bitten or tried to bite anyone, human or otherwise. However, despite being in an area with strict leash laws we regularly get rushed by off-leash dogs and he is afraid of/reactive to other dogs. He was also undersocialized so is easily spooked by random things and was not raised with kids. 
While he has shown no desire to actively desire to approach a child or stranger to hurt them, I am not stupid enough to believe a child will never rush him to pull on his ears (or kick him! I've seen children randomly approach a dog like that more than once) or a stranger wouldn't grab at him. So he's being muzzled trained.

For his safety should he get jumped by another dog again and so that people have a further visual signal of ""Back Off"" (if you're curious he's decked out with ""Needs Space"" bright yellow gear and I'm quick to move him away or yell ""He doesn't like other dogs!/He's fearful/Please give us space!"" etc but people decide to ignore me/think they know better). This space also allows me to start working on behavioural modification.

If I waited for ""the worst case scenario"" to happen I am being horribly irresponsible.

They also have proper fences to make sure their dogs can't dig out or jump over."

I was fine with it when the goal was to produce a shorter, stockier pit-type dog with less drive.

It's a horrible lesson to learn the hard way but generally speaking most big dogs (especially bully breeds, all sizes of terrier, sighthounds like greyhounds and northern breeds like huskies) have a prey drive and that means your little dog can be viewed as a squirrel/rabbit/something to chase, grab and shake.

Dog parks are pretty crap and I don't bring my bully breed boy to them either.

Also: in the future please don't do what you did and start sticking fingers up dog butts.
It doesn't necessarily work and you put yourself in a prime position to have the dog turn around and retaliate.
Immobilize both dogs by grabbing the collar and/or scruff and lifting slightly (or in this case the big dog) and then use a breakstick (if you have nothing you can use in that capacity essentially choking the dog off may be necessary). You immobilize because want to prevent further shaking and tearing. Once separated you remove the dog from the situation immediately.

Don't pull on the dogs (this increases damage), don't scream or hit them (this can rile them up more and make them bite harder) and good god don't put fingers up butts.

There are places in the world where, especially to use public transit, dogs must be muzzled. Regardless of breed.

A muzzled dog can still pant, drink, take treats and everyone is safe. The  can't bite and can't eat garbage, poop or poisoned meat off the sidewalk. They can't be startled and nip a child.

That stigma won't change unless we work at it/normalize muzzle use.

Waiting for a bite to occur before admitting that your dog needs to be muzzle trained is a mistake. Not only that but then you can't take your time to decondition your dog to the muzzle.

Also it doesn't matter *why* your dog has poor social skills and is reactive. All that lunging and barking and rushing to meet another dog is likely to cause a fight and also terrify any humans.

You're likely going to want either a Jafco muzzle or one of the wire basket muzzles (Dean and Tyler freedom muzzles, ForDogTrainers etc).
Theoretically some of the heavier duty leather muzzles might also be an option as they're sturdier than the biothane but easier/softer than a wire basket. But of course leather is high maintenance.

He plays fine with other dogs in controlled settings if they're properly introduced and off-leash....at least he used to.

You also seem to have no understanding of canine behaviour because the dog that barks/growls and is continually threatened will usually escalate to a lunge and bite eventually.

I never, ever take him to any area where there are supposed to be off-leash dogs. No dog parks, no trails, nothing. If we're out on a walk and we see a dog coming on a leash we cross the street etc. He is more than happy with that. It's not like he sees a dog 30 feet away and decides it has to die.

Honestly it shows a lack of respect and concern not only for other dogs and people but also for your dog and their safety.

dogs,fo438um,t1_fo3wi0l,1587497445.0,"So...if people started keeping kangals as house dogs and suddenly everyone wanted to keep one and people were breeding them carelessly and keeping them in cities you don't think it would cause a problem and you would start seeing attacks and fatalities like you do with the pitbull type dogs?

No dog attacks for 'no reason'. Either it's prey drive or the dog feels threatened (or in rare cases the dog is very ill). Regardless of breed. 

You cannot tell me a Kangal is inherently docile but then say it makes exceptions for what it sees as a threat. These dogs were bred as guardians. You cannot also say it is fine so long as it is in a suitable habitat. All dogs are fine as long as they are kept in suitable habitats.

As I said it's due to human error and human made factors that a dog breed becomes dangerous. Absolutely, my dog was bred for prey drive and dogfighting (at least his ancestors were) and so I keep that in consideration. But don't tell me a Kangal of all things is some sort of peaceful harmless dog. They are not. 
You're willing to make exceptions and frame the Kangal's needs and realities a certain way as far as its potential risks and drives as to imply that it isn't a potentially dangerous animal. 

Even your greyhound can be a threat to other animals and most greyhound people will be serious about muzzling, especially if the hounds are running and playing together. In fact there was just a post about muzzling greyhounds and some of the comments were really eye-opening for the average person. Having a pack of hounds running together and then the pack immediately turns on the dog who trips. 
That would horrify the general public and if greyhounds were popular enough they'd cause an uproar, if enough cats and dogs were killed. 

I don't blame a greyhound for being what it is though. Though proper ownership is necessary. Just like I don't take my dog to dog parks and keep him away from little animals and am careful with him when I'm in public because people like to let their dogs rush up to him. I'd muzzle him if I could but the hype and mythos around pitbull type dogs likely means I'd lose my home because his breed tendencies are thought to mean he wants to automatically maul a child or that he is the strongest of dogs to the point that he's almost not really a dog."

There is likely in no way to be the amount of poor breeding or overbreeding with kangals as there is with many dog breeds in the US or Canada or the UK. 

You said it yourself that the way Turkey handles its dogs and cats is unique. As is the conditions in which they live or your childhood dog lived.

If you don't actually see and experience the pitbull-type dogs because of where you live...why make this post? I'm confused.

And actually: I'm part of enough reactive dog groups wherein yes we do see human and dog aggressive livestock guardian type dogs with bite histories.

In case you're curious there have been a few Kangal attacks against humans in other parts of the world and there's more than one result about them being used as fighting dogs and being cautious with them around strange animals and strangers who are human.

When I think inherently docile I think of a golden retriever. Not a Kangal. Kangals put in suburban and urban neighbourhoods and bred/treated like pitbulls would become like them.
But they've managed to avoid that and stay localized to working homes in rural areas that understand them. Thus they stay out of trouble/avoid being on public radar for the most part.

Much, actually, like pitbull-type dogs did when they were carefully bred and kept by the old dogfighters.

There's just as much strength and potential and tenacity/ferocity in the Kangal as the bully breeds, if not moreso. Yes the pitbulls are terriers so the flavour is different, but not the amount."
dogs,fo3f99z,t1_fo36wg2,1587485901.0,"Obviously the larger the dog the more potential for damage and the more severe that damage will be.

The four pitbull-type breeds have a breed tendency for more dog aggression, absolutely. Yes breaking up a fight between two tenacious, strong dogs is a problem. 

Yes I've heard of Kangals. 
Your example is a false equivalence though.

How many times have you legitimately seen a kangal where you live? Are they being massively overbred and poorly bred so that they flood shelters? Do they have a reputation and ease-of-access for those who would be irresponsible or downright abusive? No. They don't.
If there was someone who was killed by a kangal we'd likely never hear of it.
So it's not a 'pitbull issue' due to the breed itself rather it is a human issue and if you put any larger dog breed in this situation you would begin to see the same problem. The fact that each decade has had it's 'scary breed' is testimony to this.

You cannot compare the two.
If kangals were bred, raised and owned like a lot of the bully breeds are you would absolutely see a rise in fatal bites and attacks.

Note I am not saying there isn't a pitbull issue in the sense of attacks and deaths. Absolutely there can be/is particularly in the US. But it's not the breeds in itself but the practices around them.

Where I live it is nothern breeds who have been responsible for nearly all fatalities. Despite no shortage of pit bulls. If it was something in the breed we would see the exact same issues as we do in the US....but we don't. Which should tell you something.

This isn't to say that we haven't had a fatality from bully breeds where I live. We have had just one. But it was a dog with two prior bites, who had to be kept muzzled in the house, was frequently left unattended and who belonged to a young man who named him after the devil. This was a preventable fatality had the city acted prior or there been responsible ownership it never would have happened. Yes the dog was euthanized as it should have been (arguably it should have been at the time of a second bite).

The interesting thing is that many of the deaths caused by northern breeds here have the same risk factors as those caused by pitbull type dogs in the US. 

I.e. dogs in a pack scenario, poorly socialized dogs, unneutered dogs left to roam, dogs kept chained up, dogs with no training and small children left unsupervised or put into unsafe situations with dogs.

When I say it's ""not a breed issue"" I am not saying a larger/more powerful dog who is tenacious and has prey drive isn't more of a risk than the same aggression from a small dog.
I am saying that the factors that cause any 'strong enough to kill a small child or another animal' dog to be dangerous or commit those attacks and fatalities are human-made (excluding that yes sometimes dogs develop brain tumours etc).

I am also not saying that pitbulls (or other dogs) who display dangerous behaviour shouldn't be dealt with. Nor am I saying that it is impossible for human aggressive pitbulls to exist without there having been abuse etc.

Also: just as a side note a simple google search will bring you multiple hits for greyhounds biting children. Heck even a newspaper headline wherein a small child was mauled (and yes, that was the word used)."

But unless you have a dog specifically bred to do nothing and be a companion nearly all dog breeds have some tendency to problematic behaviour be it high prey drive or dog aggression or issues with strangers. After all we bred them to do various types of ""work"".

I will absolutely admit that my dog is prey driven and dog reactive. As with any dog, but particularly one bred for work and who is on the bigger side, you're right that it's imperative he's handled right and trained responsibly.

But I'm tired of the harassment and stigma when people don't realize the 'pretty husky' will demolish cats and a greyhound will often chase and kill small dogs too. Or small terriers that will do the same. Or that the herding breeds will tend to chase and nip (or worse).

And honestly, I've seen more than a few reactive or outright aggressive (be that with strangers, kids, dogs or other animals) dogs of ""family friendly"" breeds.

Honestly, with any chronic illness you have to. It's important.

I'd up his amount of soothing, calming activities (puzzles, kongs, sniffing for food, chews) and exercise/mental stimulation to reduce excess energy. Your husband might try (when the dog starts humping) to say 'uh-oh/too bad' (neutral voice normal voice---it just means 'nope, that's not it' it's not an aversive or correction) and then calmly lead him (even if that means pup has to wear a short leash in the house) to behind a baby gate or some other barrier (maybe an exercise pen---but he's a big dude so I don't know about that). Time out ensues (don't leave him there for long periods of time, just enough for him to calm down and obviously don't respond/let him out if he starts throwing a tantrum). Let him out again when he's ready and the moment he gets humpy/excited just repeat the same procedure. 

Basically humping means he gets removed from the group so to speak and tells him in a non-scary manner ""hey man, when you hump---you lose out, go calm down"". You can also work on teaching him to bring a toy to offer to your husband when he wants to play and encourage/praise him/reward him with attention when he interacts appropriately. 

Neutering will help, but there are also plenty of intact dogs that aren't humpy monsters. So it's partially hormonal but also just a dog with inappropriate self-management and social skills."

He might also benefit from an enforced nap wherein you put him in his crate with a chew toy and let him snooze for a bit, if he won't settle with a chew toy/kong or wtv on his bed.

If you can, I'd also look into trying to put his daily food into regular kongs or the kong wobbler type toys or other puzzle/feeder type toys to help occupy his mind and it is more of a calming/stress relieving activity than one that amps him up.

If you attempt to just 'put boundaries' and take things or make access more complicated from the POV of an insecure, anxious dog you make it worse because now he has evidence that there is a potential threat to his resources. 

You want management, not direct confrontation. Take him out on a leash to potty, bring him back inside the house, pick up the poop. Call him away from his poop with a treat or toy if he immediately poops and then goes to get it. 

If he's snappy at mealtimes feed him in his crate, door closed. 

IF he's already lunged and bit he's over threshold and then you trying to pressure him to go into his kennel (which it is pressure at that point) just fuels the fire and can result in crazed lashing out. IF he'd follow a treat or toy just toss that into the kennel and then close it however is safest.

He is resource guarding his poop. You have also likely further created a stressful situation associated to the whole situation of his poop so he lashes out when someone tries to get it. 

Both the flinching when people pick things up and biting while folding laundry points to a dog that is nervous and anxious in general BUT also points to a possibility of abuse. 

He needs a veterinary check-up, likely medication, muzzle training/conditioning and to wear a leash in the house so if you need to manage him you can do it with less risk. 

If you're about to do something you know is a trigger (fold laundry) put him away in another room or in his crate out of sight.

dogs,fmrgxix,t3_fwidcx,1586322869.0,"There will always be dogs, regardless of breed, who aren't 'wired right' in the head and no amount of owner responsbility and effort will change that or make them safe dogs.
There will always be dogs, regardless of how good their genetics may have been, that have poor early life experiences/are poorly socialized or who have bad experiences and have their temperament altered. 

Different breeds have different tendencies towards certain traits (in any breed there will always be outliers).

Whether or not those genetic tendencies and/or individual baggage (from trauma, poor socialization, inborn temperament issues) become a liability issue does depend on the owner and their commitment to managing and training their dog.

I do also think we are moving in a direction where what we expect of dogs is not something that most dogs can be. We seem to be expecting the sort of temperament seen in on duty service dogs that even most dogs specifically bred for that purpose cannot meet.

We expect our dogs to be perfectly fine and passive in all situations, to be harassed by strangers, live in overwhelming environments, not chase prey or roll in garbage and to love every dog we come across. 

At the same time we remain ignorant about how to train them and often too lazy to do the work and put in the consistency required to help them be the best dogs they can be and to have the skills/behaviours needed to be safe.

For example---my own dog that I inheirited is a bully breed (an American Bully). If we talk about his breed the tendencies there are prey drive, aggression towards dogs and a sort of 'zesty' personality that can be impulsive. This is common to many terrier and bulldog breeds.
If we look at his inheirited temperament both his parents seemed to be pretty stable show dogs and he spent 16 weeks with his littermates and mom. However due to where and how and with whom he grew up and what happened he had aversive experiences and wasn't socialized properly (he wasn't with me). 

Where does that leave him? He has very good bite inhibition, prefers to flee rather than fight and gives plenty of non-violent communications when he is uncomfortable and has, for the most part, a very long fuse (good inheirited temperament and extended time with his littermates). However, the subsequent poor socialization and aversive experiences mean he is a nervous dog who is fearful and sensitive and can get overwhelmed. He is fearful/reactive with dogs (a combo of breed trait and life experience) and can be impulsive and prey driven (breed trait---compounded by his lack of socialization and training).

Could he be a liability? This is unlikely especially with proper management and training. 
But I would be an idiot to take him to a dog park or let him run loose somewhere or take him to a loud, crowded event. However if everyone obeyed leash laws and kept their hands to themselves he literally will never be a problem.

You have no vaginal opening and thus I'd also assume you have no vagina (in any form) either. If you have no vaginal opening and no vagina there is nothing to insert the dilator into. I understand that some folks with  your condition have a sort of vaginal opening/""dimple"" wherein theoretically you could, slowly, stretch and dilate that. But if you don't have that then this sort of nonsurgical treatment I'd think wouldn't be possible. If you cannot find this sort of dimple and opening on your own anatomy (you'd be looking between your urethra and anus) then you likely don't have one. 

Have you been told that you have any sort of opening at all? If not you legitimately have no other options than to pursue vaginoplasty somewhere in the world."
TwoXChromosomes,fmm7xyq,t3_fw2qtz,1586200453.0,"This is a question best left to a medical professional. Don't attempt to DIY this as you *will* hurt yourself.

You can't simply try to carve out a vagina with a dilator. That's not how any of this works. If you have no vaginal opening then it's safe bet that your condition isn't that where at least some of these organs are partially present.

In order to create a vagina you are going to need to undergo a vaginoplasty. After which yes you will need to dilate."
TwoXChromosomes,fml7sjm,t3_fvqzrf,1586180688.0,"For upkeep and for I guess gender comfort? I just feel weird with long hair and enjoy the androgyny. I also have really thick hair and my scalp doesn't breathe. Also less neck pain.

It's kinda like asking me why I wear xyz boots or pants or wtv.

I just like it that way.

No regrets here. No hair in my face, easy to wash and take care of. I leave about an inch or a little bit less in the winter but can go shorter in summer. If I go shorter then the fish hook shaped scar on my head shows up.

I will say though that if you ever want to really grow it out again be prepared for awkward hair styles for a while."
disability,fml4qhp,t3_fvj7ii,1586178558.0,"Yup.

It is part of me and innately impacts the way I experience the world.
I eat, sleep, cry, laugh and love in a disabled body. 
It arguably also causes a power dynamic and impacts the way able-bodied people feel and think about me.
There is a history and group that I am part of because of it."
disability,fml46sj,t1_fmklhei,1586178153.0,"Why is your story any different?

I haven't had nearly the support that some folks have had either, but I'm still here and kicking. I'll be 29 shortly.

The major surgery I was put through as a child ultimately caused a progressive neuro condition that causes extreme pain and is descending into various levels of paralysis/paraplegia. Yes it sucks. But I'm in therapy, taking my antidepressants as needed and learning to once again modify my surroundings and adapt. 

I understand that different countries offer different levels of support but considering you've had the ability to travel to Japan to study you're hardly immobile and as trapped as you think. Relocate. Learn what's available where. You don't necessarily have to stay trapped with your father.

I say this as kindly as possible from someone who has been there and done that but you sound depressed as hell (which is entirely reasonable given your circumstances) and in need of therapy to help change your thinking patterns and process your grief and frustrations. Medication may also prove helpful.

No, you're right, cerebral palsy doesn't have a cure. You can't fix damage to the brain. But there is no reason that you couldn't, regardless of your age, start some physical rehab and stretching. Yes medications can help you manage some other symptoms.

Life isn't over till it's over. It's only lip service if you make it be/believe that it is."
disability,fmk6px2,t1_fmk62n0,1586145958.0,"Nope it doesn't.
We *juuust* passed something that will eventually bring government buildings to some sort of standard but that's about it.

Each province has a whole 'cannot be discriminated against based on disability' thing but the legislation to actually do anything isn't really there and varies province to province.

But they're all pretty bad.

Honestly not even banks, grocery stores and pharmacies are universally accessible. Some are, in theory, but you can forget about most businesses. Schools are enh too."
disability,fmk67at,t3_fvngkt,1586145573.0,"Hey, we're out here and many folks with CP get married/have children and work or do other things in life they find fulfilling.

It's hard in a world not made for us, you're right, but we're not doomed and unlovable.

Hang in there. Reach out and talk to people, connect with other disabled folks.

Our path in life might be different or slower than folks without cerebral palsy but it doesn't mean we're doomed to a horrible life."
disability,fmk5sg6,t1_fmk4e1o,1586145269.0,"As a Canadian honestly it breaks my heart that nobody ever organized to get something like the ADA passed.

I'd never survive down in the US medically speaking. But damn do I wonder what it would be like to live in a world with ADA style legislation.

I just had to drop out of university because they won't accomodate me, so I can't get into classrooms, don't have a desk, have nowhere to pee and the power doors and *two* tiny elevators are either broken/unreliable or crammed with able bodied students. It's a kick in the teeth."
disability,fmk48rp,t3_fvmmty,1586144162.0,"Same.
I've rewatched it multiple times.

I often wonder what the hell happened to that sort of activism up here/why it never took off."
reactivedogs,fmjeq4o,t1_fmiyj67,1586128833.0,"Yup tried the living grass patches for the balcony and they don't last long enough with him to make it feasible unfortunately. He's about 55lbs.

He won't use pee pads and the amount of pads I'd go through would be horrendous even if he would."
reactivedogs,fmh1tj2,t1_fmh036h,1586064058.0,"Compared to where we were at when I inheirited him six months ago he's a rockstar.
I'm familiar with the concepts well enough but an urban environment and my mobility issues (I'm a wheelchair user) make it challenging to put the theory into practice.

If you have any tips/ideas I'm all ears though.

He's very food motivated but tends to get randomly spooked with unpredictable triggers as he's not only reactive but also just in general a nervous dog who takes a while to recover. I am blessed in that compared to a lot of dogs on this subreddit he's very quiet in his reactivity (he's not a barker or screamer or thrasher) but he still freezes, stares and it's only when a dog really closes the gap (say 5-10 feet) or is being also threatening that he might snarl/grumble or give a small lunge. If he's been out running/getting some hard exercise he is less reactive but dogs are still a big thing for him.

We were working with a trainer who was supposed to come help me and start doing the exercises with him herself (initially, since she's able-bodied) and we were about to make an appointment to discuss medication before the pandemic hit."
reactivedogs,fmgu5o3,t3_fv5z8g,1586057911.0,"Yuup.
All the normally locked up all day/never leave the backyard dogs are out because people are bored. Plus everyone is like hey why not I'll foster/adopt a dog right now to keep busy.

So I'm getting a shitstorm of flexi-leads and out of control/overstimulated dogs.

I miss being able to predict when I could take him out. The only safe time for us to sneak outside seems to be nearing midnight too. Mind you that still means doing the avoidance dance with the very reactive cattle dog who lives a few doors down. Normally the woman who owns him and I are super great about avoiding taking the dogs out at the same time but with all the normies home with their dogs we're sorta stuck lol.

Then ofc living in an urban area going out that late at night means risking encountering some of the uh....unpleasant humans. Which ofc set off my dog more.

Times like this I wish he was small enough to litterbox train, honestly."
