RealEstate,fqvl220,t3_gkwx5g,1589679551.0,"I just bought the house across the street from the one I was currently living in and had owned for 15 years.  I bought the first house when I was 27 and single and my salary at the time was less than half of what it is now.  My husband also makes a decent income, so at this point, we were paying about 12% of our take home pay for the mortgage payment.  The house is fine, it's a split level though and all I could afford at the time I purchased it.  I'm tired of the split level, it needs upgrades, there's no central A/C and it has baseboard heat.  My daughter's room was basically the size of a walk in closet.  I had been talking about buying a new one for years.  We wanted to build our own, but the kids have friends in the neighborhood and we didn't want them to lose that.  Our old house backs up to a new development, so the houses across the street are only a few years old. We were keeping an eye on Zillow and sure enough, the house right across the street went up for sale. It met about 85% of our desires for a new house so we bought it.  It cost more than twice as much as our first one, but I couldn't be happier.  It's where we spend all of our time.  You can't take it with you.  If you have the money to spend and you want something different, I say go for it. I mean, don't go crazy, we're now spending about 26% of our take home pay on the mortgage, so not too bad still."

I've always been very allergic to cats, but had I not rescued them, they'd have died as babies.  I hand fed them for 2 months.  I had to bathe them weekly to keep the allergy manageable.  One kitten was sick and died.  I kept the other two inside until they started marking all over the house.  They had been neutered the day they became old enough, didn't matter. I took them to the vet, we tried every suggestion to get them to stop, including shoving prozac down the cat's throat every day. None of it worked.  So, it was let them destroy the house with cat urine or move them outside.  No one will take a cat that is essentially peeing in the house.  If we hadn't moved them outside, they'd have had to have been put to sleep at the ripe old age of 5.  If you've never experienced a laser printer full of cat urine, you haven't lived.  We have a 12x12 fully enclosed sunporch, the cat had full access to.  He had a warm bed with a heater, he had food, water, litter, etc.  He was taken care of.

RealEstate,ffvxuk2,t3_evb09r,1580276638.0,"Sounds like it depends on where you live.  I had a dying tree in my yard, my neighbor showed up with a chainsaw and cut it down.  No one cared.  If it had fallen down, the township would have cut it up because it would have fallen on the road.  You'd be best checking with local ordinance or zoning board"
networking,ffuaaaz,t3_ev5z6z,1580237763.0,"So, I can't even tell you how many network engineers/admins I've interviewed  over the years.  We have a script written ahead of time for each phase of the process, but if we get to a point where obviously the person I'm talking to does not know the answers to the questions that I'm asking, we don't continue to ask progressively more complex questions.  We politely thank them for their time and end the interview.  No hard feelings, just not the skillset we're looking for. It was pretty damn crappy of them to continue to grill you when you had already plainly said that wasn't where your skillset was.  They should have known that from your resume.  

Like one of the other posters said, I think you dodged a bullet on this one.  And from the sounds of it, your current company has really embraced the work you've done with scripting recently, you might want to try sitting down with your current supervisor to ask if there's a way to mold your current position into something a little higher-level if it means that much to you."

I said, yeah, I don't need any of that, take it off.  Left the place at $249/month.  You have to watch every little thing, it's sad :("
RealEstate,fffmf8n,t3_etcwut,1579887102.0,It's less invasive than cutting a hole in the roof and sticking your head down in there.  You should have access to the entire house.
personalfinance,ffe1ex5,t3_et01pi,1579834200.0,"I have my children as secondary beneficiaries.  They let me designate my mother as their trustee with the clause ""to the benefit of"" the children.  So my mother accesses the money, but can only spend it on the children.  It sounds like you want to go a step further though, so a trust sounds more appropriate here. 

My deepest sympathies for the loss of your son."
RealEstate,ffcfhgs,t3_esug6y,1579798335.0,"I just bought the house across the street from my current house.  It ticked a lot of the boxes so far as features that my current  house does not have that my husband and I wanted.  We had made a list, the most important features at the top.  For us, that was location, we didn't want to leave the neighborhood. Central air, we're tired of window units. Bigger kids' rooms, my daughter's room is disproportionately smaller than my son's ATM. Age of home, we wanted a home built within the last 10 years so we don't have to do major renovations.  Number of bedrooms, we wanted a 4th bedroom.  

We looked at exactly 1 house.  I called the realtor, scheduled the appointment, we talked it over and made an offer.  There's enough information online about other houses in the area that are for sale for me to determine there's nothing else that's going to suit our needs available, so we jumped on it.  Sometimes you have to take a opportunity when it presents itself.  Would you rather have regret for the rest of your life that you chose the house that was ""second best"" because you missed out on your favorite?"

mildlyinteresting,ffah58l,t1_ffadq7c,1579735625.0,"Thanks! :).  Slightly bigger, but mostly a lot newer.  We currently don't have air conditioning and our kitchen and my daughter's rooms are really really small.  So we're getting a bigger kitchen and a bigger room for her.  That and our current house is 40 years old, so it needs work done to it all the time and I just don't enjoy doing it anymore.  I used to, but now I'm too busy, so hopefully I'll find someone else who is in the mood to customize an older home.  

We saved up for quite a while to be able to afford to upgrade, good for you for having such discipline!"

When a girl tried this crap with me once my mother went to her house, sat her parents down and told them this will not happen again or their kid will be arrested.  That girl crossed the street when she saw me every time she saw me after that.  You can go to the police, this is assault and they're threatening more violence.  I don't know what state you're in, but I'd be down at the local police office pressing charges."

We've been working on cycling them out, but it's a multi-year phased process.  We're trying to future proof the network as much as possible in case budget changes make it so that these switches have to remain in place for another 13 years."
