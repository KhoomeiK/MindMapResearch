If you're really struggling to reconcile your thoughts, emotions and ego I can personally recommend psychedelics. LSD truly saved me from years of misery. Long after the drug wore off I felt like there was beauty in the world and my life and experiences had value.

MDMA,ewp4lvl,t1_ewo4xop,1565633352.0,"You can, but you won't have a clue how much you are taking. The crystals are often too big compared the dose you would normally take as well.

It's mostly to estimate the dosage but it's also good practise :)"
AskDrugNerds,ewo3rcw,t1_ewhcy0g,1565604360.0,"Depending on the antidepressants she takes, she might not have have serotonin syndrome at all. Contrary to popular belief, common SSRIs do not interact that badly with MDMA. Both Fluoxetine and Sertraline have a higher affinity for the SERT transporter that MDMA binds to. So if she is taking those then she would not have felt the MDMA.

If she is taking an MAOI then that is highly dangerous. That would cause serotonin syndrome potentially. Although I personally don't think she took MDMA. I think all the previous times she took it she didn't feel anything because of the medication she was on as previously stated. I reckon the most recent MDMA roll was actually a different drug that had a bad combination with her medication. This could be a massive variety of chemicals from various classes. I highly doubt she tested her drugs before taking them.

Always test your substances.

AbjectDust, if you are reading this. You will be ok again. Do not worry. If it persists for longer than a month then perhaps seek some medical help. You might even want to at this point if it's causing you significant distress all the time. This will not be permanent and you will recover. Although I would advise you do not take drugs for a good few months and always research what you are taking and how it works with your medication. But my best advice would be to not take any substances (legal or illicit) until you have worked through the reason you are taking the anti depressants

You will need to crush the crystal. I recommend doing this with a deodorant can with the crystal in strong foil.

Sniffing MDMA is like sniffing gravel. It stings like fuck and it can damage your mucus membranes in your nasal cavity. To take it, I recommend orally. To do that scrape 125mg (split the whole gram into 2, then 2, then 2 again to get an eighth of the gram) into some rolling paper and scrunch the paper into a ball. We call this a bomb/parachute.

Next, just swallow the whole paper and let it dissolve in your stomach. Don't worry, the paper is not harmful. Then wait about an hour. You will notice the effects coming on.

If you take too much or redose anyway and you are feeling very fucked up or unwell, seek immediate medical attention. Drink 500ml of water an hour, no more. Avoid hot and cold environments, sit down and make sure a friend is with you.
