Judaism,eujpw4n,t1_eufa6w2,1563876352.0,"Although I agree with you, I don't think they were considering Christianity a mental illness, I think they meant sometimes people call it a demonic procession when it might just be schizophrenia or another mental illness, which is another issue entirely."

Judaism,eu3ksrb,t3_cekhgy,1563417375.0,"Starting out with that journey now. My parents seem okay with it, especially since I discussed it with them prior to meeting my boyfriend. However my mother wants me to wait until after marriage like she did converting to Catholicism from Methodist, but I don't think she understands we can't have a Jewish marriage without me converting. 

Haven't yet started the discussion about it being a lot sooner than they think I'm going to convert. I'm scared to bring it up. We have a lot of Jewish family friends who would definitely defend me if my parents were mad about it, but I don't want to make it a huge thing. Especially with my very Christian Texan extended family."
ptsd,etsufaw,t3_cd9dej,1563155834.0,I gained some weight due to poor eating habits while with my abuser. I completely understand this.

I told my doc everything when I went in for my first visit with him and he was very supportive, helped me with my meds, and worked with my therapist if I ever needed him to. That included the details of my trauma. 

Depends on your level of trust with your doctor whether or not it's appropriate to share trauma with them. They are professionals and they can help in different ways than a mental health professional since trauma can cause physical symptoms too."

My cat's presence makes me calm down a lot. I don't worry so much that someone is going to break in and if they did, I have an alarm basically. 

You might also benefit from installing some sort of home security system. I find that I feel better if I know I'm going to be alerted."

It's just like major physical injuries, it will never be exactly good as new but it'll be pretty darn close."
ptsd,etep052,t1_etefth2,1562740563.0,"Most of the hotlines would be able to direct you to resources like therapy. I highly recommend it, it's helped me a lot and I know it's helped a lot of people on this subreddit.

ptsd,etee0a6,t3_cbayjp,1562729964.0,"When I started having panic attacks they were only at night when I was being abused so nowadays nighttimes are the worst because I still get extremely fearful that the panic attacks will come. 

It's probably because the more tired we get, the harder it is for us to fight our own brains."
ptsd,etecaj0,t3_cbao10,1562728576.0,"I used to do this too. One day my SO told me something along the lines that if I kept worrying about my abuser like that and checking, I wasn't going to put distance and fully heal. From that point on I've made it a goal to not look my abuser up again and I've managed to not do it for three months or so. 

The urges still come pretty often. I feel like I should see what he's up to and make sure he's not going to be in my area, but I brush them off easier now. I have to say the more distance I have put, the better I feel. 

I think the reason why we do it is validation for ourselves that they were a shitty person. It reminds you of the bad times. It reminds me of listening to sad songs to make you more sad. You look up your abuser to make you feel worse."
ptsd,ete6k3e,t3_cb8nk1,1562724208.0,"I get very nauseous which causes me to not be able to eat. I found a homeopathic remedy that worked to help quell the nausea. My SO's mother is really into that stuff and I figured, it couldn't hurt. It's strangely one of the only things I found that helps when I feel that way, and even then sometimes it doesn't. 

I recommend trying exercise too. A small workout might trick your body into feeling hungry again. I found that exercising regularly helped bring back my appetite. I don't exercise much now but my job keeps me hungry enough."
ptsd,ete5isj,t3_cb9qvv,1562723447.0,"Communication is key in any relationship. It's so special when the person you are dating accepts you fully, mental health issues and all. I was very upfront about my PTSD from the get go with my SO and he still chose to pursue a relationship with me. He has never treated me as if I was a burden to handle, and I have grown more comfortable leaning on him when I need to because of it. 

It's hard to be vulnerable but do you want to be with a person who doesn't accept you for who you are? If they get freaked out, maybe it wasn't meant to be. It's scary to think you might lose someone over mental health but if they don't want to be there for you when you need them, why date them in the first place? It's baby steps too, don't give them the full brunt at first. Let them earn your trust before you entrust them with everything."

In reality I was telling myself that I made things up and it wasn't that bad because of other things I was too afraid to say out loud. Pretty much my feelings of being a burden and not wanting to have PTSD caused me to start telling myself a different story. 

Your story is real and valid and it happened. You're going to struggle with it and healing isn't linear but it doesn't make you any lesser for struggling with it."
ptsd,etb49w8,t3_catpyu,1562636656.0,"Repression by definition is you trying to subdue something. The thing about repression though is that I don't think it's permanent. Memory loss can also not be as permanent as you think when it comes down to it. 

In my humble opinion I think memory loss is a subconscious repression of trauma and repression is a conscious one. PTSD does come with the symptom of memory loss and concentration issues due to brain shrinkage so sometimes we just don't have the capacity others do for as many memories or brain power to commit things to long term memory as easily."

It sounds like you have had a lot of opinions. None of us here are qualified medical professionals to be able to give you a diagnosis. 

I would recommend to continue seeing a therapist and don't worry too much about diagnosis but rather fixing symptoms. I found that when I went into therapy with that mindset I came out of it a lot happier with my progress.

My SO is very blunt with me about rationality and once I got over my defensiveness, it's become very calming in times of panic. Kind of like a slap in the face with logic. 

Remember, YOU'RE not an idiot. It's your PTSD that's doing it. I try to think of the part of me that panics and the part of me that is rational as two separate entities. Telling the panicking part that it's being irrational is not a bad thing. Your rational side knows that. Outsiders who don't understand are always speaking to the irrational side of you when they say things like that. They only understand rationality because they're not mentally ill and that's all they know. We have a sort of duality to ourselves, a battle between irrational panic and rational thought."

The most comforting thing both my SO and my therapist told me was that you aren't crazy or malicious if you are aware of what's happening. You work towards a better you and you fear for the fact you might be a bad person. Bad people don't care that they are abusive or mean. They care only for themselves.

Here's a good link- https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd/index.shtml -

To be diagnosed with PTSD, an adult must have all of the following for at least 1 month:

At least one re-experiencing symptom
At least one avoidance symptom
At least two arousal and reactivity symptoms
At least two cognition and mood symptoms

This is an important part of that link, PTSD has a multitude of symptoms and each person is different.

If you have the ability, go off of friend recommendations. Shopping around again can't hurt either, the first appointment is always a lot of paperwork and preliminary talks. Remember, the first appointment you don't have to open up right away, you just need to figure out if you are comfortable with a therapist. 

Once you've found someone you are comfortable with (it feels good if you've tried out a few people too), that's when it's time to really open up. It's easier with a good therapist you trust but the first few times are going to be raw and hard, that's the point. You have to drag it all up to the surface so you can heal. Trust the process.

ptsd,es2ppek,t3_c5moyd,1561533937.0,"Have you talked to a doctor or therapist? I found when I really started delving into my trauma during therapy my nightmares started to calm down since less processing of trauma was happening at night. Nightmares are your way of your mind trying to subconsciously process what you went through and in my experience conscious processing through therapy really helped. 

Have you tried a weighted blanket? I found that while it didn't help the frequency of nightmares, I slept more restfully because it kept me from moving around in my sleep as much. 

I wish you good luck <3 It's hard when you're doing everything right and things still keep happening but you keep up this good work and you'll find something that works for you."
ptsd,es2k12f,t3_c5kzww,1561527154.0,"Trauma is different for everyone. I agree that too many people shout PTSD too quickly. A licensed professional should diagnose you properly before you can be sure if it is PTSD or not, but bashing people for their right to have PTSD is wrong. If a professional told them that they have it, it's probably true no matter your opinion. A professional went to school for years to be able to make that distinction. 

I'm sorry your life is so hard. Mental illness is a terrible thing to bear but just because other people are able to work or go to school does not mean you are allowed to invalidate their trauma. People who go to work and school while having mental health issues are strong and work very hard to do what they do. Don't belittle others achievements in life because you are unable to do the same things."
ptsd,es2isvv,t3_c5hjzx,1561525874.0,"I agree with the other post, it seems to be a more common practice nowadays to give anti-anxiety meds before a procedure. I would talk with your doctors about that. Most doctors are very sympathetic if you're upfront about what you've experienced prior. They prefer not to have to worry that you're going to have an attack, makes their jobs easier too."

Now, my SO travels from work and I'm starting to have more and more problems sleeping at night. My wonderful cat has started sleeping curled up next to my head and also meowing a lot more and helping me feel less alone in a new house. Animals are certainly wonderful companions."

ptsd,es2hvjr,t3_c5al1p,1561524945.0,"I'm in the same boat, just stopped my medication  about two months back and I'm starting to near the anniversary of many bad things that happened. 

My therapist told me it's quite normal to have heightened symptoms on yearly anniversaries. It's due to body chemistry and your body feeling like it's back in the same place around that time of year. 

I don't have much advice, I'm going through that same hell and it's getting worse but hopefully having some sort of explanation helps. I know it helps me to understand what's going on with me, even if I can't fix it yet."
ptsd,es2h3sf,t1_es1rj8h,1561524183.0,"The ""lights"" are your blood vessels, basically just close your eyes and focus on trying to see your eyelid. A simple beginning meditation that doesn't feel like meditation. 

The 5 senses exercise can be done at any time. It's a way to pull your mind into the present moment rather than have it be stressing about past or future. It can even be done when you are feeling happy as a way to train your brain to continue to think mindfully (in the present moment). 

I really found that exercise helped with my anger/irritability. I need to restart that habit as well but I definitely feel it's a good outlet. The endorphins from it can't hurt either!"
