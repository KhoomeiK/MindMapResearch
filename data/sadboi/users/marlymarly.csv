It sounds like what you were doing was working, but you stopped prematurely. Several weeks of therapy is nothing for suicidal depression. A general course of therapy for depression is 9 months (although this can vary widely depending on the person). 

If the therapy was working in the past (as it sounds like from your post), I would go back to the therapist. A longer course of therapy will produce more lasting effects."

I can't tell you if you're gay or not, but I can describe what being bisexual with a history of surving male-perpetrated abuse is like for me. I'm evenly sexually attracted to men and women, but now only date women based on my experiences. 

I get scared of men pretty easily, and am usually on high alert around men I don't know. I feel suspicious.  However, if the situation is non-threatening (eg an attractive man just doing his own thing at a Starbucks) I'll catch myself checking him out. 

Thinking about having sex with a man stresses me out about fear of him not stopping if I wanted to stop, but does not invoke feelings of disgust about his body. 

I enjoy seeing a picture of a good looking man topless, although I don't necessarily want to be with him.

This is all just me; people experience attraction differently, but maybe it can help you gauge your feelings.

Remember that you're allowed to not date or have sex with anyone for any reason. It's your body and you should never feel pressured to do something that doesn't feel right."
antidepressants,flhrvfk,t3_fowblu,1585168336.0,"So Rexulti and Effexor are two different types of drugs. Effexor is an antidepressant (SNRI),  while Rexulti is an atypical antipsychotic. Atypicals are used to make antidepressants work better for people who have severe or medication resistant depression. They come with significantly more side effects, which can get pretty serious. 

I've been on both. For reference, I have ""double depression"" which means I have chronic mild depression along with recurring severe depressive episodes that are characterized by serious lethargy, sleepiness and apathy. I cannot function during these episodes. I also have pretty severe anxiety, which contributes heavily to my depressive episodes. 

Effexor really didn't do much for me. It made my anxiety slightly worse, so I couldn't tolerate more than a very low dose. Even at the lowest dose, coming off of it was hellish.

Rexulti pulled me out of a severe depressive episode in a matter of weeks. My psychiatrist warned me it worked quickly, and it did. Unfortunately, it also made me EXTREMELY hungry. I went from 120lbs to 135lbs in a month. That's a lot when you're 5 ft tall. I could eat a big meal and feel hungry an hour later.

My doctor pulled me off Rexulti because significant weight gain is a precursor to metabolic disease. She put me on Vraylar, a different antipsychotic, which changed my life for the better. I'm  around 90%-95% ""cured"" of my depression as long as I take my vraylar. The downside is that a month of Vraylar  is $600 WITH insurance. I qualify for patient assistance through the manufacturer, so I filled out some paperwork and now I get it for free."

One thing to understand is that straight sex is really penis/penetration focused, to the detriment of the woman. Most women can't orgasm from just penetration. There needs to be some clitoral stimulation.  Because of this, straight women generally orgasm significantly less than female partnered women. In addition, this penis/penetration centered view leads to the homophobic idea that lesbian sex is ""not really sex."" Very few people say that gay men are virgins if they've never penetrated a vagina, but lesbians are called virgins all the time for never being penetrated my a penis. Why should one sexual organ define sex? 

Fingering ability depends on the length of the nails. If they're shorter acrylics, all that is needed is to be careful. Acrylics are far more dull than natural nails as they are thicker. For longer nails, some women put a cotton ball under the nail and then wear a latex glove. There's also dildos, strap ons, and so many other toys that can be used if a woman desires penetration.

However, the reality is that a lot of lesbian sex doesn't include penetration. Oral sex and stimulating the clitoris via hands or toys is easier and way more satisfying. Leabian sex takes a little more practice, but when done right, tends to produce far better orgasms  than PIV sex. I say this as a woman who can orgasm from PIV alone, too."

I knew I was sexually attracted to women when I was 12, but kept from calling myself bisexual because I felt like I could never love a woman. Personally, this was due to some internalized homophobia, comphet, and low confidence that took me a decade to work out. I had to open myself up to the true possibility that a woman could love me (romantically) and that I could be happy with her. Once I started dating women (vs hooking up), I started getting the exact same butterflies that I got with men. My girlfriend makes me feel all sorts of wonderful, romantic things. This is just me, though."

actuallesbians,f7z5znq,t3_dy6qtp,1574105823.0,"I'm hearing a lot of disbelief in your post. 14 years old is old enough to experience sexual attraction, even though we might not like to think about it. I figured out that I like girls when I was 12, but didn't fully accept it for another decade. 

Even if it is a phase, I think it's healthy to  let her explore it (in an age appropriate manner). There's so many women in their 20s and 30s (and beyond) who are still stuck questioning their sexual orientation because they didn't feel safe to do so when they were younger.

I'd also like to point out that at least for me, my queerness was part of the reason I was awkward and had trouble making friends at her age. Girls intimidated me because I liked them as more than just friends."

actuallesbians,f7wxqvk,t3_dxhxb0,1574040911.0,"Hi there, I'm in a similar boat. I prefer women but dated only men for the longest time due to insecurity. I've only recently overcome this and just entered my first real relationship with another woman. The sad truth is that there are a lot of people just looking for a third or FWB, and a lot of women seeking a meaningful relationship have been burned by these types of people. That being said, just from my experience, sapphic women seem to have a broader definition of ""attractive"" than straight men.  They also know what it's like to be socialized to hate your own body. That being said, if your self-esteem is keeping you from putting yourself out there, I would definitely consider seeking help. A lot of support groups are free and meet in the evenings. One thing I learned is that to successfully date women, you have to really put yourself out there. I signed up for a bunch of dating apps, frequently sent the first message and made their first moves, and was rejected a whole lot."
antidepressants,f7ijfy4,t1_f7i4jbd,1573760548.0,"It's different, at least in my case. Adderall improved my mood for about three months. During that time, nothing really bothered me, even sad things wouldn't make me sad. Then the halo wore off and my mood was back to where it was, I just had a bit more energy. Note that energy is not the same as motivation. 

When I found the right medication cocktail, my general mood improved, but  I felt appropriately sad when sad things happened. I got dumped, which sucked and I cried a lot, but I was still able to go to work and class. For comparison, on adderall I wouldn't have cared too much about being dumped, and when unmedicated I wouldn't be able to function at all."

actuallesbians,f6qruzk,t3_dsl3v6,1573084331.0,"I'm a bisexual woman, even though I hate the term bisexual. I feel like it has been co-opted by bi-curious people or people who are heteroromantic. Both identities are totally valid, but it does make it harder for bisexual people (especially women) to communicate that they're seriously interested in a relationship with the same sex. 

I never call myself a lesbian, because I think that word implies same sex exclusive attraction. 

I used to say I was ""kinda gay"" but my girlfriend said it makes her feel like I'm implying that I'm only ""kinda into her"" when I'm totally into her. So I stopped using that term.

Queer still has a lot of negitive connotations with it. Since I'm relatively straight passing, I feel weird using that term because it was never used as a slur towards me. 

So that's why I just use gay."

antidepressants,f4yfvtj,t3_dm4fwj,1571875878.0,"Are you having issues with anxiety on Wellbutrin? Wellbutrin is not an SSRI like most antidepressants. It's a mild stimulant sometimes used to treat ADHD. Because of that, it can cause anxiety which causes memory issues. If that's not the case with you, then I'd bet the Prozac is the one causing memory issues. It can take some time for side effects to show up.

I would also carefully reflect on if your depression might be getting worse. Personally, I started having a lot of memory issues when my depression deepened. 

All that being said, this is just general information. I would talk to your doctor before going off of any medication. We're just random people on the internet and don't know your full medical history."
