UpliftingNews,fnjgsx2,t1_fnjdqmm,1586998671.0,"Common misconception that psychology is easy. I was a pre-med major and wasnâ€™t happy there. I changed to psychology and worked just as hard as I did in pre-med. No disrespect meant towards individuals who work and/or study in the medical field. Iâ€™m just saying that psychology isnâ€™t just an easy degree. Besides, unless youâ€™re in engineering or computer sciences, an advanced degree is required for most notable jobs."
UpliftingNews,fnj8xxg,t1_fnj72j8,1586994226.0,"Here's the issue. It's not simply about what our work ""merits"" as it seems in your mind. The issue is that anyone who gets a degree, anyone who has any kind of skills needs ""experience"" to get a better job that gives a larger paycheck. Problem is, the job market is so terrible because individuals who can and should retire in order to open up jobs for fresh graduates refuse to for various reasons. When you can't get a job due to your credentials, you're forced to get something to pay the bills. That's not always glamorous. Trouble is, it won't even pay the bills. God forbid people who deal with the public during a pandemic actually get something for risking not only their lives, but the lives of their family as well."

Coronavirus,fluprc4,t3_fr1gwy,1585507487.0,"So here's my question. Why does the US continue to take a reactive approach to the virus? We know cases are spreading like wildfire, and while I will be the first to admit that the economy would take a beating to a proactive measure for social distancing (such as nationwide quarantine), it's taking a massive hit anyway. It seems to me like the heart of the issue isn't being addressed and to me, as long as we remain one step behind the virus and those who would ignore social distancing recommendations, we remain one step behind the potential end to the pandemic."
psychologystudents,fkhr7tl,t3_fil5i6,1584204462.0,"I think it depends a lot on the program youâ€™re applying to and the professors that teach in that program. I went to a smaller university and usually had a fair amount of tests, on which the information ranged from memorizing details about important past research to applying these theories and how they might contribute to mental illness. A lot of my tests were short answer tests though, so you had to be able to apply what you knew to some degree. Every semester I had term papers that would either be research proposals, literature reviews, etc. which require a much more in depth knowledge of what youâ€™re writing about. 

Hope this helps!

Edit: Also just thought of this. The universityâ€™s goals, as well as grad school programs offered at that school may play a part as well. For example, if the institution has PhD programs in psych and is a big research institution, youâ€™re more likely to be focused on doing research of your own, knowing the research process, etc. But if they have PsyD programs or are more clinician/practice based, youâ€™re most likely to need to know more practice based/diagnostic/applied knowledge as opposed to research knowledge. It also depends on if youâ€™d like to go into research or practice as your long term goal as well."
AcademicPsychology,feth9a5,t3_eqd7fi,1579375453.0,"Not too long ago, I performed a study looking at the effects of physiological stress on memory. This required one group of participants to put their foot in a bucket of ice water for a total of 6 minutes and recruitment was definitely a pain. As far as my advice goes, try to orient a lot of your advertising towards places you know your participants are likely to be (such as an international students office) and to make sure any incentive that you have is posted as well. Unfortunately itâ€™s hard to get participants when the time investment is high, but I wish you the best of luck!"
psychologystudents,fep5dtz,t3_eq8gep,1579312507.0,"Essentially, bottom up processing is the interpretation of the physical stimulus alone (I.e. light reflecting off a surface for visual stimuli, sound waves for auditory, etc.) in order to determine what that stimulus is. Top down processing takes thing such as learning history, context, etc. into account in determining what a stimulus is, rather than just the physical stimulus itself."

Being a first generation college student who just graduated and is awaiting answers from PhD programs, itâ€™s almost impossible not to feel like everything Iâ€™ve earned hasnâ€™t been as much a product of my own work as opposed to the efforts of all those behind the scenes.

BDSMAdvice,fd7y9v9,t3_ek9ju9,1578211811.0,"As her partner and caregiver, I can vouch for the fact that u/blonde_koala's perception of reality is just fine. I don't think the point of her original post was to look for sympathy or be referred to a therapist, only to find someone who understands what she's going through and who is willing to talk about those feelings with her. Now I'm I the field of psychology, and I understand that sometimes you have to be a little more harsh to explain people's situations and things clearly, but this is frankly ridiculous. So let me clear up a few things.  
1.) Our relationship is just fine and we're still closer than ever. She doesn't expect me or the world to just 'create rainbows' for her. She isn't saying she does, she's asking for reassurance through feeling like things don't live up to her expectations. Which I'm not seeing a lot of.  
2.) Obviously, this is a post pertaining to an aspect of her mental health, and I realize this will cause many people to comment that have different opinions. However, don't mistake attributing blame for attempting to help someone. Any therapist should know and acknowledge that what she feels isn't her fault and wouldn't antagonize her over that. She obviously has enough going on without being made to feel like what she's going through isn't valid."

Like some have said, financial aid concerns are an issue, so maybe if those concerns were dealt with. Plus, statistics show that the longer youâ€™re out of college, the less likely it is that most will enroll. I feel like if high schools taught more toward the long term versus how important standardized testing and things of that nature seem to be to them, that things would be much easier for young people."
