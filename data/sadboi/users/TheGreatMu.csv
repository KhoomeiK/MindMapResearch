You can literally be persuaded of anything/everything which can be remarkably dangerous.

If you are influenced negatively while taking LSD it can drastically affect your trip which can then even have great influence on your sober reality.

Theres alot of risk involved with psychedelics and you should never fuck around with them. Don't take them if you are not comfortable mentally and even comfortable in the environment your in. (SET & SETTING)

Also there is a risk of hppd hallucination peristent perception disorder. Which you have flashbacks of hallucinating.

So yeah. I wouldn't recommend doing psychs often if at all. 
Don't take anecdotal advice from people on reddit who report positive experiences and have bought into the glorification of psychedelics. I was one of them too.

I was diagnosed with depression but stopped anti depressants about 2 months betore my trip.

The trip was very enlightening and fun.

If i were to give you advice it would be this:

1. Stop anti depressants at least 2 weeks before trip, otherwise you can get serotonin syndrome and possibly have seizures/die.

2. Make sure you trip in an environment you trust. I also suggest tripping with someone you can relax around, someone you can be open with.

3. Make sure you have the next day free also, when i had my first trip i usually leave a few days as a trip usually has afterglow effects.

4. Make sure you are feeling relatively good around when you take it. I have gone against this and taken it recklessly and it was not fun at all...

5. Write helpful tips on your hands, like ""breathe"" ""pain is temporary"" ""i took 200ug acid at 11am"". They can help ground you.

That's pre much it, at the top of my head at least!

If you have any questions let me know bro, happy to help!"

There was an invention that gave some animals the ability to communicate to humans. So for example dogs are able to communicate to other humans on a basic level. Its very much like having a child at the age of 3 or so communicating. You'd see the invention in movies as dogs played in movies also. It was a pretty awesome.

There was a huge difference in science. It's as if it was ahead of ours by a dozen years at least. 
Health care was doing very well as you could live to a very old age and not even look that old. If you took care of yourself and did everything to appear and feel youthful you could be 75 years of age and look 45 years old.

I had many friends who were 30 years older than me but looked my age. You weren't considered a senior till about 110. If you took care of yourself, took fitness and age care supplements and vaccinations.

I did not do this, i was already a clone of someone else so my life expectancy was pretty much already halved.
I took some supplements for fitness. There was alot of controversy regarding these tools. There were rumors that they had stem cells inside them. But it was still legalized in some countries.

Drugs,fdd6xqv,t1_fdd6gws,1578297514.0,Wb just DMT and weed?
AskReddit,fdcovif,t1_fdcmocm,1578280311.0,Other way around if anything
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdckqmt,t1_fdckldr,1578277330.0,Yeah dude. No biggie. Please try meditate more. Like daily. Start at 1minute and work your way up. This really helps.
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdcjmc2,t1_fdcj198,1578276528.0,"Yeah, you can't force it. I've been chasing a complete ego death for a while, also DMT breakthroughs too. Which i still havent had. Im trying to figure out how and i think the best way is to clear your mind, meditate and let things come to you. This is my trial and error. 

Your mind can't be to active when you take it. You have to have a accepting mindset going in. Try not have expectation and do it for the experience. Don't force anything.

If you want a full ego death, I'd meditate and eat well for a month prior to taking a high dose. Also meditate once you ingest it until it kicks in. 
Thats the closest ive gotten.

Also do it alone and in a place you are 100% comfortable with. Set yourself up really well so you are uninterrupted for at least 8 hours.
Go for quality as opposed to quantity.
You wanna make sure your mind isn't foggy and your mind is relatively clear."
Drugs,fdcj2t7,t1_fdbhdfk,1578276142.0,"So weed and Dmt is a good idea? Ive wanted to try it, but i heard it makes shit weird."
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdciy1j,t1_fdciqo8,1578276050.0,"I see, all i can say when shit like that happens is embrace it. I usually write on my hands, ""meditate"" ""you're on lsd"" ""breathe"" ""pain is temporary"".

Perhaps have a break for a month man. Don't abuse it, really takes away how special it is"
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdcioat,t1_fdcii0k,1578275861.0,Yeah exactly. What happened with your bad trip? Was it showing you how much of a loser you are? Or was it just unreasonable fear and torment
AskReddit,fdciixe,t3_ekf2qh,1578275758.0,Drugs and fast food.
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdciagp,t1_fdcgqbb,1578275590.0,"That is weird. 

Well for example when i did Lsd my first time with a friend, he convinced me to drive him to his house, which was about a 10-15m drive. He had to go toilet. That was the reason.
I said no, Im unable to drive but eventually gave in after another hour. Something I'd normally never ever do. 
It was 200ug and i ended up driving him after about 5 hrs into the trip. I also had to stop before even gettin halfway because it was overwhelming.

On my 2nd lsd trip i took 360ug with the same person, we got uber eats 4 hours later after mixing it with weed. The delivery driver was waiting on the street so i made my friend go get it. He comes back scared, his energy totally different, because we forgor about the uber eats and the driver had been waiting for about 15mins. So when my friend got it, he was quite mad.

He didn't say anything. My friend could sense it. Just like i could sense the fear my friend had when he came back with the food. We ended up having a very paranoid trip that he was going to come break in and stab/kill us. 

We searched my entire house 5x. And still felt bad. Ended up smoking more weed to get rid of the paranoia. It worked.

So there it is. Lsd makes you very sensitive and suggestible to your environment and mindset. 

Which is why set and setting is key. Also don't abuse it bro, doesn't help. 


TL;DR: LSD makes you sensitive and suggestible to your environment and mindset, anything can affect  your trip.  Be careful what you do and who you trip with. My friend made me drive on first trip and second his unreasonable fear was contagious, even though we were consciously aware it was dumb."
LSDTripLifeHacks,fdcggqn,t3_ekhqnu,1578274298.0,"Could be a multitude of things, how do you have it more than once a fortnight??

Isn't there a 2 week tolerance?

As for bad trips, it can definitely be because of abusing it. Set and setting. If your brain is dopamine deficient (you don't feel to great) thats another reason)

You're also highly suggestive which can affect your trip dramatically."
Tinder,fdb18p5,t3_eka4x0,1578252594.0,Why is everyone being mean to you lol. I found it hilarious. I was expecting people to sympathize with you but i get this instead!
Tinder,fdb139r,t1_fd8cxu6,1578252533.0,I chuckled. She has a narrow sense of humor.
Drugs,fdary05,t1_fd9llnz,1578249329.0,"So you don't let emotions get to you as much?

I've been chasing ego death for a while. Ive done lsd and shrooms abour 2-3x each. With 360ug and 5grams of shrooms max.

This week im gettin 180ug, 100mg Mdma, some weed and some DMT in the mix. If i don't have an ego death. I'm sure it'll be a pleasurable experience!"
