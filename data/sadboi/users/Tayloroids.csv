Discovering this community has been amazing, too. Sometimes just reading a vent you really relate to is enough to get through the day, knowing you’re not alone with certain feelings or thoughts.

TrueChristian,feszj6x,t3_eqh1ap,1579370469.0,"This obviously doesn’t apply to everyone else, but personally all of my Christian boyfriends have been extremely judgmental and controlling.

I have yet to date a non-Christian man, but I’d be lying if the thought didn’t cross my mind. It almost seems...easier, I guess. I’m just tired of feeling judged. There are definitely things I need to work on, I’m not combatting that idea. Like every other Christian, I’m broken and susceptible to sin.

I also try to stay goal oriented, so at least I’ll get some feeling of productivity even if I’m having a crappy day in bed. They can be more important goals or simply hobby related ones.
