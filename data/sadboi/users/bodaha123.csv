Meditation,fr10rru,t3_gm128g,1589810987.0,"We can all agree that there is a present moment. Every second you experience is the present moment. Be present. Be grateful that you are aware, alive, and awake. Be grateful you can experience consciousness. That you can see and taste. It’s a crazy phenomenon. You were created and grew inside of your mothers tummy and she had to not do anything but eat good and stay alive. The body took care of the rest. How cool is life? Don’t ever take anything for granted."

Meditation,fnr6in0,t1_fnda9es,1587180507.0,"Phew haha. I was in a loving relationship that held me back from my dreams geographically- it also wasnt what I wanted. I moved, my family lost our home, I changed jobs, started questioning what I want to do with my life, realized I didnt know who I am at all....was drinking and being violent, went to therapy for help. Started EMDR therapy, which helped me dig up old trauma I had from my childhood where I was molested and abused. I had a panic attack for the first time ever shortly after then fell into a deep dark depression for about 3 months where I lost about 30 lbs and hardly left my bed. I went on medication, didnt work. I started asking existential questions and having attacks of why I was here. I realized that it was trying to tell me, I'm living a life i did not want to live. After a year of bouts of depression, I left my career, the relationship, everything. The universe kind of came up with weird oppourtunities for me to leave, like opening a door for me. I went through a ton of pain last year...this year is different. I made a plan to move to my favorite place, start my own business, train for a marathon, and rebuild. I read about my dark night of the soul, I journal, I do my self work. I put my trust in the universe, and Ive become closer to my goals and dreams, while discovering who i truly am. It was honestly the craziest experience. I was so scared, i couldnt trust myself to eat, i couldnt sleep, i looked like hell. But i learned that it was all worth it, and it meant something. If it wasnt for the dark, i wouldnt have awakened and been turned to spiritual insights and texts. It was so bad to the point where i was on my knees praying even though i was not religious. It was all entirely a spiritual experience."

Its a shelling away of my old beliefs. I had nightmares, and old trauma come up too. Its a purging I guess when meditating and being on the spiritual journey. We all deserve peace and can have it with how we deal with our fears. Fear makes us stronger.

Meditation,fnnii8s,t1_fne6wu7,1587093153.0,"YES! I totally agree with every bit of this. It is by far the hardest healing you can do but so worth it. Besides the fear I still experience once in awhile, the growth that has happened and healing has been so enlightening. I am now on a much better path. If it wasnt for the dark moments, I wouldnt be here. However, I didnt know when it was going to end, it was very dark. But now I know that it does have an end, everything does. Even this fear. I have the book by Louise Hayes as well, super healing. Lots of reading has helped me on this journey. Im not able to share my story with others!

If i can simply just see the fear separate from me, and not be afraid, the entire thing goes away. Just still curious what it is, but in the bigger picture happiness matters more"
SuicideWatch,fl8re2f,t3_fn31cw,1584930434.0,"the real you is aware that you are letting emotions drive you right now. let it pass. keyword pass. storms come very interestingly, little high, little low, big high, big low. ride those waves. life has a funny way of testing us, but the story you were thrown into (the abuse story) is not you. you are much more than that. I'll repeat, you are much more than your story. Do what you will with it, you can use it as a tool to become greater. That option is on the table for you. It'll be hard but you will be so happy, you will help others you will save lives. we need those like you. don't let the storm take you. I too, faced the storm, abusive parents, meaningless life, I climbed my way out. I never in a million years thought I would get better. Being depressed, blinds you. Just be aware of the fact that you are taken over by an emotion, but that you are much more than that. you are so great, so beautiful, so WORTHY, yet you are unaware of that fact right now. and that's okay. How can you use this to better the situation and yourself? Start journaling a dream life and thinking of ways to get there every single day. what makes you happy? singing? reading? Do THAT EVERYDAY. do the small things that bring you small joy everyday, it will build. you will see clearly...it will all be just your""past"" story. you will live a new story. but you must give it time. time time time is on your side. let it happen my love and my heart goes to you, ive been there. ride this wave. stay on this ship. when its time to cry...CRY. release it all out. but don't give up <3"

derealization,fghvo36,t1_fghnevl,1580795251.0,"I wonder if your derealization is just a habit loop. When a panic attack happens, our brain remembers that pathway and tries to stay away from it but instead we make it worse worrying about having one. Also you could just be disassociating.....which is something that happens to someone who has experienced trauma in some form. You may have something unresolved underneath this that’s making you afraid. Always go into the fear never away from it. The more you run the more it catches up. Fight it and show it up everytime. That’s when it leaves you"
derealization,fghvgpc,t3_eyjp0n,1580795069.0,"Haha yes! I’m afraid I’m going crazy all the time with my anxiety. I had an intrusive thought that I would hurt myself even tho I never would. So then you start thinking there’s an “it” outside of you that controls you. But the trick of the game is that it’s YOU and YOUR control the entire time. Everyone has intrusive thoughts it doesn’t mean your schizo. I feel like you’d have a harder time functioning in society and have larger delusions. See a therapist so you can just prove to yourself you’re not. But yeah I was fearful that I was bipolar for a longgggg time. But I’m just going through a rough period in my life. You also have to remember mental illness is just a label that we make up in society, our true form is a spiritual being."

Meditation,fg1gd54,t3_ewc2lg,1580426610.0,"spot on. Going through it right now. I have no pleasure to really be drunk because I am aware of the craving of it. I'm aware that it makes me feel worse after and gives me a temporary high. I've been even getting that way about coffee, I find myself not wanting it because it still is an escape to get away from here. It's caused me so much anxiety and depression. I run now because of how great that makes me feel and I have even gotten down about the fact that I run to reach a high. craziness lol. But I think being aware of these things is important, but not to fix them all at once, like someone told me on my post. 

I wrote ""meditation helped me realize all my neurosis, now what do I do with all of them?"" it almost made me feel a bit worse at first, because its a realization. But I think its important to discover a high within ourselves that we can always access, without anything. That way we can live our lives knowing we could always access this place within us. 

But yes I am totally changing and not the person I once was. Its called the dark night of the soul. Because you aren't yet who you will be after you left the person you once were, its a LULL period of time"
