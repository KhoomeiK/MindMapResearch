AskReddit,fl37z1x,t1_fl1xagt,1584772148.0,I'm glad to hear you're over it and doing well now. Your case is reassuring to me because my partner is about your age and also has asthma. I've been paranoid about him catching it and it potentially being bad for him. Knowing that others in a similar boat have caught it and been okay is really comforting.
weddingplanning,fkwlz1t,t1_fkwc9yb,1584596750.0,"May 23rd here, hopefully moving to September 5th. Our venue coordinator has been home with her kiddos all week and hasn't been able to confirm the date yet. So I'm just anxiously waiting to know the date for sure before contacting guests and other vendors.

Fiance and I have decided to still actually marry on May 23rd, since we're having his brother-in-law do the ceremony for us at the big day. We're going to have a small ceremony with just close family, maybe 20 people. I'm curious if anyone else is going to do a similar thing and what they have planned for a celebration? If the virus is still abound at that time and it's still recommended to socially distance, I'm worried we won't be able to really do anything special."

Weddingsunder10k,fkuvz3d,t1_fku3fcx,1584557163.0,"It really depends on several factors. If people practice social distancing and cancel social events for now, at least for the recommended 8 weeks (recommendation by the CDC in the US anyways), it really can do a lot to help.

Weddingsunder10k,fktjxfg,t3_fkfrj6,1584523244.0,"It definitely sucks to have to re-plan and reschedule everything, especially for those who have it planned soon. But it is the right thing to do if your plans fall within the next few months. Mine is supposed to be May 23 but we're postponing until hopefully September (venue will be able to confirm dates with us tomorrow). Better to make the arrangements now rather than in 2 months."
DIYweddings,fkmr0mm,t3_fj85qf,1584336909.0,"My partner and I made the decision to postpone our May 23 wedding today as well. It's a hard choice, and I wish you the best with the rescheduling process.

We figured that even if the worst of it was over in a couple weeks that it isn't worth waiting to see how it plays out. Plus, even if it's all clear by then, it's very likely that many of our guests won't want to travel out of paranoia anyways. For now, we're planning to postpone the wedding itself, but still have a courthouse wedding thing on the day we planned. That way it isn't a ""lost"" day and we still have something to look forward to."

We had a fairly long layover in California and decided to take a taxi to the coastline and have dinner on a pier. I was completely amazed and giddy about seeing the ocean on the beach, and so close to me. After we ordered, I excused myself and ran to the beach, threw off my sandals, and just splashed in the ocean and laughed. It was beautiful and majestic and terrifying all at once to take in."
BPD,fh9w4ud,t3_f223v4,1581390981.0,"I've never thought about it as a potential BPD thing, but I'm the same way. Even still, I plug my ears and stand still for a moment when I turn on the shower, vacuum, flush a toilet, or even turn on the TV too loud. I can't use hair dryers because the sound scares much.

Now that I think about it, I think it breaks down into 2 categories for me: 1) sudden loud sounds (toilet, door slam, etc) that almost jump scare; and 2) loud ongoing sounds (hair dryer, vacuum, etc) that make it impossible to hear other things happening. With those, I wouldn't be able to hear if I was being snuck up on or something, and that's what scares me the most."
