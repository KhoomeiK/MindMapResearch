ABDL,fhg7cpj,t1_fhfw3j0,1581560255.0,I like that response!  Thank you! 😎👍🏻😊❤
abdl_irl,fhfmgcx,t3_f0m08e,1581546415.0,"Yep, this has happened with me on a number of occasions.  Including when I worked at a call center in Las Vegas.  I had to hide feeling slightly embarrassed, but also hiding my true feelings since the person that brought it up kept saying how sick & mentally ill someone would be with wearing diapers for fun.  I wanted to shout & tell them how untrue all of that was.

Glad I didn't stay there long afterward."
ABDL,fhf87q8,t1_fhf628f,1581538200.0,Perhaps so.  I just know that my aunt felt very strongly about it.  And it stuck with me to this day.

ABDL,fhekj4d,t1_fhejltu,1581524336.0,"My post was about more acceptance so that those of us in the ABDL community aren't having to consciously check to make sure our diapers are covered up completely to avoid being pointed out.  Like if some kid points it out, we're not going to be embarrassed by it because the parent will explain that it's because either we have incontinence issues (like myself) or that it's for fun, and not something to be pointed out.

That sort of thing."
ABDL,fheiewn,t1_fhed2xg,1581523065.0,"Those Christian (& some Catholic) groups who are in the belief that sexual intercourse should be left for the sole purpose of procreation, and that any other reason to have sex is considered not just severely sinful (like ""You're gonna go to Super Hell for having casual sex""), but also particularly damaging to one's eternal soul.  

I once got briefly caught wearing my diapers & masturbating in them, and my aunt who is extremely religious (a self proclaimed Christian woman) gave me a heavy lecture about how I angered God with my ""perverted act"", and then said if I didn't stop it, that I'd be condemned to an afterlife of slavery by the devil/Satan.   This was when I was maybe 7 or 8 years old. 

That was one of the many reasons I became agnostic.  But everywhere I looked, when there was a religous group (usually based on Christianity), they seemed to be just a bunch of prudes.  As though they've NEVER done anything that would offend God or his Angels, or something similar.

Supposedly, after a cursory search from Google, someone said this is true for those who aren't ""Born again"" Christians.  I remain skeptical that it's a majority of faiths & denominations that are prudish.  That even the act of holding hands with the opposite gender/sex will lead to unmarried couples having multiple pregnancies, which will lead to the babies being the spawn of Satan & such.  Very ridiculous shit.

Anyway, THOSE are the types of Christian groups that I refer to."
ABDL,fhe99el,t3_f2jyro,1581517124.0,"I don't often come across this, but the few people I have ""tested"" have all been female, and I usually test the waters with them (no pun intended) by saying something like ""That would be awful having an accident in their pants!"" [Referring to a news article about some level of incontinence problems that someone experienced publicly]

If there responses are something like, ""Yeah, I'd feel totally embarrassed!  I wouldn't know what to do!"", then they probably aren't going to be ABDL-friendly.

If they respond with ""Maybe they should be wearing Depend next time!"" Or ""Aren't adult diapers a real thing?"" Then it's possible they're ABDL-friendly.  But it's really hard to gauge!

The best response that could indicate ABDL-friendliness is ""Yeah, I had that happen to me one time, and then afterwards if I knew I might not make it to the potty, I decided I was going to wear a [Depend] or something!""

But again, you have to really gauge it good before taking that leap of faith."
