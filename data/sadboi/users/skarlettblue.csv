OCD,fabvmts,t3_e88qmd,1575929544.0,"I do this, and it‚Äôs pure torture. Some days I can control it better and don‚Äôt check, or I leave him and the people associated with him blocked for longer. (These periods I‚Äôve noticed are getting longer). If I manage to keep myself busy enough I won‚Äôt check at all. Sometimes at the end of those days I feel proud that I haven‚Äôt checked and sink back into it like a gluttonous baby. 
I don‚Äôt have much advice, like you this feels too fresh and frustrating. Personally, I think trying to be strict with myself is going to be the only way to overcome the now-habit and the emotional hold they have over me (that I have also fabricated)."

depression,f83gwmu,t1_ez8eejw,1574211812.0,"Just as a little update, I totally didn‚Äôt start meditating. It was an impossible task but taking time to remind myself to actually breathe does make a difference. Ill slowly look into the other exercises once I have a job, and a routine, or just a genera grip on my life. 

More importantly, I do the advice you gave me on writing a few pages to get it all out. Whatever it is before starting. That made the greatest difference for me to start working, especially during a time where I felt like I had no one I could confide in. 

Thank you again for your advice, kind stranger."
depression,f83gnve,t1_f81405a,1574211672.0,"This is a very kind ... very delayed ... response to my post. The trouble with thinking more positively is that it doesn‚Äôt alter certain realities, but I do my very best to shut down intrusive or unnecessarily mean thoughts. 

Going on long walks is wonderful! Or cycles, it‚Äôs often difficult to find people to go with so it ends up being a good time to work through certain thoughts, or just shut off entirely. 

I appreciate what you‚Äôve written, and I will try to keep it in mind the next time I am grumpy over nothing. Hopefully you do the same and are trying to grow a little everyday too."

True though, plus there‚Äôs the added side of the feeling like you can finally fucking breathe through meditation... so you‚Äôre probably spot on with needing to get into those healthier habits. In all fairness, a great bit of the resistance comes from everyone in my circle (especially my father) telling me to meditate and calm down... which is aggregating, which loops back into that spiral. 

Somehow a stranger on the internet sounds more reasonable, perhaps because your own struggle comes across much more abstract and thereby relatable. I‚Äôll definitely try it, at least for 10 days and see how i feel üòá"
depression,ez7eci1,t1_ez63no5,1567722466.0,"! I definitely considered this, and keep trying to think of the different parts of the work as mini essays or blurbs. I‚Äôm hoping this will somehow be easier to digest and also create a stronger argument (sure ha ha ). That‚Äôs also an impressive talent on your part, but I can understand how relieving the ‚Äúpain‚Äù of writing so to speak to diverted by something else.... usually do most of my citation work while watching films. I‚Äôll try to take your advice into consideration this weekend. Thank you so much :)"

I try to do the journaling thing when I get really repetitive or intrusive thoughts.. but this sounds like actually a really useful tactic. Meditation is ... a battle in itself.  The flushing the system metaphor is good, that‚Äôs going to feel good thinking of it in that way too. Whatever I actually do get a good bit of work done I get this weird happy-high on it and then set impossible goals for the next day. Maybe less is more at first... Thank you for your advice!!"
