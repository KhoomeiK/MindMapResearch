If you eventually dedicate 40 hours per week (2,080 hrs per year), how much time will you spend on proposals over one year? 

I’ve come to believe that spending a little more time with a client in person has a better payoff then the backend time you put into proposals. However, Proposals should be different and custom, but also be respectful to your time. If you ever hire a sales person, which is what I did, it was easier for them to adopt templates, rather than teach them a custom proposal too.

In Jobber, you can add photos and other brochures as attachments to the quotes. You can also include a terms and conditions, and default items in Products/Services to make it more customized, but also speed up the process. Customers still gave us feedback about the professional and unique proposals they would receive through Jobber.

Generally, sending out proposals after the consult makes sense for big projects, where there are options too choose from, or you PHC recommendations that they now have to consider. Basic straight forward pruning and removal can generally be priced on site. Try to sell some straight forward jobs on site to cut down on backend proposal writing."
sweatystartup,f938kow,t1_f8x34m3,1575052630.0,"I did very custom proposals on Word, PowerPoin, etc the first few years too. It’s always important that your proposal is different from competitor. That difference can come in many forms. Your positive feedback is something I also received. 

When I got super busy and moved full time into my tree business, I adapted my Jobber to be more customizable and stand out from the crowd. Jobber allowed a more efficient process when doing 4 to 8 proposals a day, compared with a more detailed Word document. Don’t under estimate efficiency in the future, and don’t assume you can’t make good customized proposals in Jobber too, that clients will be impressed with, with photos and good prescription writing."
sweatystartup,f93689q,t1_f8vw1ra,1575050926.0,"A tree business is really 3 separate mini businesses...pruning/removal...stump grinding...and PHC. Identifying client niche and the financials/business cycle further categorizes your business.

For PHC, Rainbow Tree Scientific Advancements and Arborjet are two of the largest national suppliers of PHC products and solutions. Their websites can be used as a tool to help incorporate PHC into your tree business. I recommend choosing one of them as your primary supplier when starting out, so information is easier to digest and you develop a good working relationship with their sales staff.

Of course, the best information on tree pests and tree health are from university websites, but that can be information over load for someone new. Both of those suppliers mentioned are reputable, but trust and verify their information at universities, because they are definitely trying to make money and screw up sometimes. A skilled Arborist will discern the information the suppliers provide, but use them as a tool/resource.

PHC opportunities differ wildly throughout the country due to different tree species, pests, and environments. Thus, the information on PHC is a lot more fragmented, and as a result, most tree services don't offer it or refer it out. The most valuable tree services, in terms of EBITA, have an in-house PHC program."
sweatystartup,f91s148,t1_f90s3ob,1574999439.0,"The tree industry is very decentralized. There are up to 30k tree companies in the US and most are very small, self-employed/craftsman operations. 

I would suggest finding a small company to subcontract the work too, while you generate sales. Many small outfits can use opportunities to fill their schedules better. If you have very strong marketing, then you can also convince an Arborist to run the leads, as they would have opportunity. Having an Arborist do to the sales is very important, IMO, (although not necessary).

This is an industry for people who know what they’re doing, because the risk of failure can be catastrophic. Very high risk to life and property. 

Acquire jobs only you’re comfortable your team can do. Don’t sell to sell. This isn’t lawn care (no offense to that industry)."
sweatystartup,f8zvy7g,t1_f8zpz7e,1574965387.0,"Yes and no...but mostly Yes.

At some periods, being overstaffed might be OK, if you know you will need people soon. It's a skilled industry, so it's more important to retain talent, build team comradery, and smooth out systems so you can be even more productive during the peak times. Great Arborists like working with Great Arborists, so team preservation is important.

You can't ""backfill"" with people in the tree care industry, like you can in lawn care and snow plowing. It's skilled.

But Yes, focusing on networking with landscapers (good lead source), property managers, and build smart residential marketing platforms (for new and existing clients). Building that Sales Pipeline is critical, and then once that's really rolling, sell yourself for a little bit, and then hire a sales arborist to conduct estimates. Most sales arborists like the tree/knowledge/people aspect, not prospecting for work. Give them the lead/appointment, but you need to focus on the business development/marketing. In the last year I didn't really sell, but I controlled most of the commercial relationships and dispatched my Sales Arborist to estimate/write the prescriptions when requests come in. He would also handle all residential leads.  Recruiting/Business Development and creating systems was pretty much exclusively what I was doing at the end.

sweatystartup,f8zssxs,t1_f8vuulz,1574964470.0,"Which is OK. If it's just a weekend venture right now, as long as you're obtaining a good hourly figure, you're doing well. For example, it takes you 8 hours to do, and you average $110 per man hour, but it took another company 4 hours to do, but they executed at $90 an hour...you beat them!

The price for the client, and the price you charge, is RELATIVE to your TIME Input, which unfortunately isn't on your balance sheet.

The 2 biggest costs for a service business is the TIME inputed and Opportunity Costs. I know owners who work 30 hours a week and their revenue is 1.2 million and owners that work 80 hours a week and do 1.5 million. Who's ""winning"" in that scenario and can have a better family life? Your financials are relative to TIME. Also, you can look at Opportunity Costs in 2 ways: Explicit vs. Implicit. Explicit is nominal. So if it costs you $200 for training, and you can't do Production that day, the total cost of choosing training over production might be $1000.  For Implicit, it's the opportunities you missed where you don't know the value. I literally referred a tree company a referral that would have provided that person with $300k in revenue.

sweatystartup,f8zo3dv,t1_f8za9vg,1574962975.0,"I actually have a 4 year degree in Forestry, for traditional woodland management, so I have the scientific background on trees. During some summers between semesters, I worked for one of the largest urban tree companies in the world. 

After a short stint working in some beautiful, but remote places of the country, I missed the interaction I had with people. Urban tree care is a medium to help people in my community, and I missed that while working for Forest Service. However, even though both professions involve trees, one is people driven and the other is science/data driven. Very different industries.

In my first 3 seasons: my clients were actually other tree companies, where I would be their consulting arborist for upscale clients, and I would do contracted PHC work. Most tree companies stick to just pruning/removals/stump.  My advertising costs were zero and my overhead was very small.

Transition year: A 50 year stom hit my area into my third season, with trees down on homes. All of the businesses I was networked with were too busy, but the demand and emergency was huge. I actively started selling removals and pruning, and subcontracted those services out. I did some very basic pruning/removal myself with a dump trailer, and an independent climber as a helper. Of course, there was a natural demand prior to the storm, but after 3 years of just being independent, the storm was a catalyst to pivot, which I was thinking about doing anyway.  Because it was a week-night/weekend venture (15 hour days on Saturdays/Sunday), I could charge very good pricing, and pick and choose my jobs easier, because I was dependent on it for income.

Last 3 years: Full-service with employees (had up to 9 full-time) and now it was my primary income channel.

Technical education: Read these books: ""Tree Climbers Companion"" by Jeff Jepson, ""Knots at Work"" by Jeff Jepson, ""How to fell a tree"" by Jeff Jepson, ""Fundamentals of General Tree Work"" by Jerry Beranek.

I didn't remove or prune a tree in the last 3 full years. I was not an expert before then either (more of a scientist), but I can speak basic language of climbers and understand their needs in the field. I sold at pricing where they were NEVER rushed, so I understood basics about their procedure.  Pricing is a continuous calibration between sales and field. I ended up not showing pricing to my most of my team, so they wouldn't feel rushed. I just wanted them to be good arborists. I would calibrate my pricing based on my analysis of their production. My Lead Climber was also the Field Trainer, and I would work with him to implement field training programs. I would teach staff on more scientific/arboricultural items and other business operational items. In the later years, I just read books on how to lead and manage people, and business books. It's a people business, so learn to lead people and understand the financial side of the business so you can provide opportunities for them."
sweatystartup,f8yw7yu,t1_f8vhy74,1574953693.0,"Removals are the most profitable? What are your removal margins compared to Pruning/PHC?

Ahereing to the Law of Averages/Large Numbers, you can still easily AVERAGE $150 to $250 per hour on  an entire Pruning/PHC service portfolio, with far less inputs. A great Removal Portfolio might average $115-$125 per hour over the course of the year, with far more inputs and maintenance.

Again, huge home runs are possible on removal jobs where you average $200-$300/hr per man.

Why wouldn't Bartlett, Davey, Savatree (the 3 largest residential) just go after removals (because there are more requests and needs for removals) if removals are the most profitable?  TCIA Financial Reports (don't sell them anymore) and IBIS Industry reports also state otherwise. 

There are ""good"" businesses that just focus on removals, but I think they might be lacking some perspective on how to price, write prescriptions for, and attract the right pruning and PHC Clients."
sweatystartup,f8yuv3d,t1_f8vknim,1574953169.0,"Of course, when I say ""High Cost"" that's relative to industry or the size of tree service you are. Tree service is ""higher cost"" than in other green industry trades. For example, 1) The equipment expense runs about 10% higher than a typical lawn/grounds maintenance company 2) Workers comp. rates can be 2 to 5 times more expensive per employee compared to a lawn/landscape business 3) It's statistically one of the most dangerous jobs (lumped in with Loggers under OSHA metrics) 4) Most residential tree work is project basis. We don't have reoccurring contracts like the lawn industry does. 5) Resell EBITA value of tree businesses can be less compared to other outdoor industries.

If you add in a strong mix of commercial clients, 20% PHC, strong Pruning potfolio, you can have a multi-million dollar tree business with Net Profits in the 25-30% (before owner pay). Most don't achieve that once scaled past $600k in revenue, but it can be done with the right perspective and knowing numbers."
