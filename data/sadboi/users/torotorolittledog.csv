Straight from www.ADA.gov

Read: It's fairly subjective, but doesn't cover every illness. True disability is defined differently. You're challenging the wrong person. I have two ""illnesses"" that are protected by ADA. By protected, it doesn't mean I can call the ADA police and they'll make people stop discriminating me. It means I can go after the business by suing them.
