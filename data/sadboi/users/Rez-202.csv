comingout,fpfa3vh,t3_gd3c0w,1588565499.0,Can you talk to your friends or text them without your parents knowing? Also if your family is going to be very negative please be carful and don‚Äôt tell them anything and hide your LGBTQ+ things because the feeling of wanting them to know is easier to deal with then them kicking you out or anything else.

latebloomerlesbians,fp703du,t3_gbj8lw,1588361625.0,"I had ‚Äúspecial‚Äù classmates. Now looking back I realized most of them were girls and maybe one or two were guys and the feelings I had for the girls was more of a childlike crush and for the 
guys was just a friendship. 

I would always try to tease and scare the girls and act tough.

I would watch the girls play four square and get then all for them if they lost it. 

When I would listen to music and the singer was a dude singing about a girl I would insert myself as the dude lol.

I would play with my actions figures and make the girls kiss.

I played The Sims and made myself (girl) kiss other girl characters."

comingout,fnyxfw7,t3_g4pu35,1587379288.0,"If you want to have a cake then I say do it if it makes things easier for you. But maybe tell them one on one in case you both need to have a discussion afterwards. 

Feeling comfortable will take time especially from the religious background your coming from. But you will get there with each step forward especially with your support system. Don‚Äôt be scared if it takes you a while because you are not alone others have gone through this as well. Each person is different so no rush‚Äôs 

Hope this helps and I am cheering for you."
comingout,fnywzea,t1_fnx7cos,1587378801.0,"That‚Äôs very tough. But I have one idea that could work; talk about religion and maybe bring up the part where it says gays and lesbians are bad and see if they agree or not. That‚Äôs the only idea I could come up with and it seems like it wouldn‚Äôt blow your cover. To bring up that topic maybe say you saw a news article talking about a gay themed topics like a pride parade or something. 

I am also an introvert and have social anxiety so I completely understand. Maybe find friends online, LGBT support groups, gay straight  alliance in college or something else like this and I know it‚Äôs hard but try to approach people and hopefully gaydar will assist you in finding others like yourself. But no rush in approaching people in real life because it‚Äôs tough so start with baby steps. Maybe talk to your school therapist or watch YT videos on anxiety and such things to help you make friends. There are apps like LGBT+ Amino, Taimi, YouTube and of course Reddit where you can find people like you. 

If your mom and grandparents are going to affect you negatively I say hold off. For me it sounds like they will make you feel invalid and unloved and no one deserves that. You are in college that is stressful enough so I don‚Äôt like the idea of adding more stress. So do what you need to do so for the future you will have many possibilities to achieve happiness. Right now you are loved and supported and it‚Äôs tough to hide your true self and know you may be unsupported if you come out but imo you need to have as little stress as possible to focus on college and have a decent support system in case this turns really ugly. 

But this is my opinion you know more then I do, of course, so in the end it‚Äôs all in your hands. If you need someone to chat with you can message me. I will be a freshmen in college this fall so idk if I‚Äôll be the best choice but I can try to be somewhat of a support system because stuff like this is hard to deal with alone."
comingout,fnqk8lc,t3_g32dzp,1587166276.0,"I believe that one day you will want to come out even if you know you‚Äôll be unsupported by your family. But it‚Äôs up to you financially and emotionally speaking in when you want to come out. Your health and shelter are the top priority no matter what. Your mom sounds kinda like my mom. She loves you so maybe she‚Äôll turn around and support but not understand like my mom with my brother. In the end I believe you‚Äôll find your own version of family if your mom and grandparents disown you. You will have a happy, loving and successful life even without them."

policeofficers,fksvtf1,t3_fet8kt,1584499579.0,I would say talk to him about it. Yes something bad may happen but it‚Äôs not too likely. Especially if your moving all the way over there and living with him it‚Äôs not reasonable for him not to be seen with you. Let‚Äôs say a criminal sees him with his work buddies they could easily want to target his buddies just like how they may want to target you so really there isn‚Äôt much of a difference. But also make sure he doesn‚Äôt want you there or be seen with you for other reasons. Hope this helps.
