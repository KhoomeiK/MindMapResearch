alcohol,fm8q274,t1_fm8odow,1585853905.0,"Essentially yes as it's your BAC that spikes and then decreases. Your BAC is determined by the amount of ethanol (alcohol) in your blood. Its something like 1.5-2 hours for your BAC to go back down to 0 after one drink (definitely double check those numbers please, I'm guessing based on what I remember from my alcohol class)

So for example if you take 2 shots back to back (1.5 ounces), in 1.5-2 hours your liver would have processed 1 of the 2 shots, and your BAC would drop from a .04 to a .02. Another 1.5-2 hours and it would probably say 0. 

 That's why they say if your driving never have more than 3 drinks, because a drink raises the average BAC to around .02 per drink (based on ABV of the beverage and weight of drinker). An IPA could be double the ABV of a bud light, so ABV is really what you have to be careful of when determining what 1 ""drink"" is. Liquor considers 1 ""drink"" to be 1.5 ounces.

So if you had a six pack (or six shots), your BAC could hypothetically be .12 (again this is based on many factors) and if it takes 2 hours to process a BAC of .02, it could take around 12 hours to blow a BAC of 0. 

This is why I said as long as they don't drink a six pack they should be good :)"
