As for school, im the first grade eather my mom or grandma would come and get me from school. In my country there are no buses or anything so parents or more often grandparents would take them and it is noramal for younger kids to to school alone,take public transport and cross the street. But then my mum got boyfriend and we moved. She took me to new school on the first day and goy me home and told me to remember the way and I had to. I was 6 I think and I had to walk for 15 minutes cross the street and pass lot of stray dogs. It was normal  for parents to pick up kids, even the older ones, when in winter got dark pretty early but my mum did it only when we moved like 3 minutes away from school and that was when I was older. Her boyfriend  took me to school far more often. I was just so often alone that I would go to school earlier and sometimes go to ny friends.  I now remeber going there before other  kids recess  which was hours away from my first class. I used to think that girl from my class who got picked up till 6th grade was baby and to think my neighbour is crazy for talking her first grader to school when she just needs to walk for a minute or so but now I realise how crazy it was and how scary it could  be after dark. Even my frends mum who  beat  them regularly  would come to pi k them up."

First one was geography teacher in middle school. Students would do whathever they wanted scream, jump, play and she had no authority to stop them. We never did a thing and she only had us copy bolded words in our notebooks. She would talk us about being great singer and sing in class.I am sorry for that but she was a joke to us and  boys would make fun of her. And we would have to learn lessions word to word when we had vocal examination but we could look into textbook that was on the table and basicly read everything. She always forgot her glasses and sometimes used magnifier to read. I don't  remember a thing from her classes.

Now biology teacher was the same but she had multitude of imaginary diseases and only favored few boys who had to do presentations every few classes. 

Then there was substitute German teacher with whom we studied one lession called 'Zeppelino' for months . Then she gave us like 40 pages  in  workbooks for homework  to catch up at the end of semestar. Of course no one did it and that is hoe I went from loving German to hating it.

Now in high school they are all tolerable?
I hate them all. 
Well there was profesor R who stands put from sea of incompetent profesors in my school. Known to all high schoolers in every school in city,nightmare bringer,fear inductor.Man I miss her.She had taught  us physics for the last two years.  She had every second of the class planed and would apologize if she was second late .No one could talk at all . When we had vocal examination it was most fear inductionary thing ever. You would shake so much from standing before her that you would forget everything  and if you missed word from definition or something she would have you repeat everything even if it was just conjunction . For written examinations she would give us 12 or so questions from past lessions to learn.Now that wouldn't  be to bad if one question wasn't  one or two long definitions (like half of the page long) formulas,graphics if there were , to name mesuring units and to name F-force ect. We had to answer those in our notebooks qnd she would chose 2 questions for test. We wrote our tess like essays so those two took long time to finish. And if you did those correctly you got D.We never practiced physics problems in class only got them for homewoek so noone had any idea how to do them. She would find tiny mistakes and take points for example 0.05 point on this 0.1 on that. I would spend month before test solving every problem in workbook, learn every question amd she still found ways to give me B or C. For short time I was a legend  because I had a B. Impossible grade.Half of our class failed physics and we are all nerds most of us having A in other subjects. Once,after one of those tests  she stood up two girls who were failing class and started yelling at them that they didn't hand over their tests. My friend and I were to busy stifling laughter because she mentioned that she was corecting them until 4:20 in the morning  while those two were sobbing in fear and others tred to  defend them.  Parents and head teacher were involved.It turned out that they fell of her table. Some got panic attacks,one girl got arrhythmia because of her. After years of tryig thay finally got her to retire this year.When I hear younger kids complainging about physics I laugh at them and just remeber what I survived. We still talk about her fondly and wonder how is she doing.  And when I have problems I remind myself that I survived that woman and that there  can't  be anything worse than her.
There are more of them but they all cant compare to R."
