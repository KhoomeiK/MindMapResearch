I was always broke but held off on school. It seemed really hard at the time and it was, but I have a lot of great memories from that time. Don't beat yourself up over mistakes you make,  just learn and move on.

With the situation you're in I would not worry about college right now. You are young and you may waste a ton of money going to school for something you will never actually do. You can go to college at any time, I think it's better to go in your 20s anyway, when you have a better grasp of who you are as an adult. 

It's not easy at such a young age but it's doable. Labor/manufacturing jobs usually pay ok without experience. But definitely look for IT work if that's your field of study. The issue is a lot of IT jobs like to do internships and school/work programs and don't want to pay a decent wage for a fresh highschool graduate. (IMO)

If you drove up to an empty spot with someone standing in it saving it would you have done the same thing? Usually not I would guess, most people just keep going.
