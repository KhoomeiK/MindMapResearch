leagueoflegends,fpiehnb,t3_gdmys3,1588639249.0,People are more toxic because the game itself is toxic. Control is so low that people just lose it. As an ADC main this season has been one of the worst seasons I have ever played. To carry games as an ADC you have to play at a level so far beyond every other role. You get deleted faster than ever and your damage takes forever to come on line. In soloQ it’s at its worst. You rarely receive any help in fights since supports want damage/flashy champs that can’t really peel you as well as flashy top laners. Even when you have peel they won’t use it on you since it’s soloQ and people only think about themselves. I’ve switched to playing tank tops and I actually have control now. I can peel important players like you are supposed to. It’s a shame that riot has let ADC get to this point. If you are 6/0 as adc and the enemy top is 3/0 they win.
