haircoloring,fqcekdi,t3_gi289y,1589256286.0,"From my personal experience I say be veryyyy careful. My hair was just as you described yours - could hold up to anything. It was long and thick and strong. I‚Äôm naturally about a 3 and had balayage with the lightest parts about a 7. Then I bleached over bleached hair one too many times and it fried off. I was only using a 20 developer and I‚Äôm experienced at DIY hair. Lost half my length, and what was left was destroyed. That was two years ago and it‚Äôs still damaged and not at the length I‚Äôd like. It was a horrible experience and I wish I could go back and leave my old hair alone.  Just my two cents of course not everyone has my shitty experience!"
haircoloring,fq7yatl,t1_fq7wgg9,1589154697.0,"Tread very lightly with that virgin hair!  Sounds like you could do with a (colored) gloss. Sallys carries ION, you could use their Demi. It will wash out after a few weeks, and if you hate the color that can be sped up. Be sure you don‚Äôt use anything that says warm or gold or red. Stay neutral or even ashy, as you‚Äôre afraid of brassiness. 

I‚Äôm not a pro but I‚Äôve been doing my own hair on and off for years. I‚Äôve used ion Demi before and had some success, it‚Äôs not at all damaging and is pretty commitment free. 

Now light brown can mean different things to different people, that‚Äôs why with hair color people talk in levels. So you saying light brown could mean you‚Äôre damn near blonde. Mind that the lighter you hair is the more it‚Äôll cling to even Demi-permanent color.  Best of luck!

Edit - Also whatever you choose, do a strand test! No one ever does that and it can save you alotta stress. Pick a smallish chunk from the under layers of your hair and see how it turns out!"

Sally‚Äôs is closed so I‚Äôve tried to shop online with them for a toner and alllll they‚Äôre showing is wella. I‚Äôm a level 6 and am brassy as hell so I feel ya. I also tried the Kristen Esse toning gloss from target. Don‚Äôt bother it did nada!"

bipolar2,fokrpai,t1_fokke8u,1587847663.0,"No, it hit me like a train all at once one morning. I was in such a bad state with the anxiety preceding it, it‚Äôs hard to tell if maybe I had a few days of minor symptoms I just missed. I can understand your concern!  

And I‚Äôve taken melatonin for years and sometimes it really helps. When I rely on it for long periods the efficacy definitely diminishes. 

Body scan mediation for sleep has helped as well. I use an app called insight timer. 

Best of luck to you friend and I hope you‚Äôre ok!"
bipolar2,fokjwgd,t1_fokhsok,1587843438.0,"So the anxiety I was feeling lasted about a week, and subsided as I felt sick. Like I was beside myself with anxiety on a Monday, and Tuesday I felt so sick the anxiety was completely over shadowed. 

Initially is was bad body aches, fever, and that overall rundown feeling you get with a flu coming on. I had some diarrhea and I lost my senses of taste and smell completely (almost 100% back now). Had some chest congestion but no cough (and I‚Äôm a smoker). Fatigue and headache, too. But not extreme. I only felt sick for about a week and I‚Äôve had pneumonia that was much worked than this. The fever was the hardest to beat, almost three full weeks with at least a mild fever, and it would come and go. 

I‚Äôm in Maryland, USA. I contacted my doc as soon as I had symptoms and she talked me through and checked on my every day, and eventually got me a test when I lost taste/smell a few days in. Talking to a medical professional may help you with a bit of piece of mind, even if you can‚Äôt get anxiety meds. Valerian root can help sometimes, and with sleep. Everyone‚Äôs different though. I‚Äôve found puzzles and coloring to help a lot with anxiety recently."
bipolar2,fokfd28,t1_fok316n,1587841035.0,"Hey there. So I almost hate to tell you this, but a few days after this post I started feeling sick, and a few days later got a positive covid test. I‚Äôm better now and didn‚Äôt have severe symptoms. 

Psychogenic fevers are definitely real though, I‚Äôve had them many times.  And I‚Äôm still feeling like at the time of this post it could have been anxiety related. 

The fact that you felt good on your run is an awesome sign!  When I was sick I never had a cough but did get winded easily, just from talking sometimes. 

I‚Äôm sorry your anxiety is so bad.  I feel you.  Can you contact a physician at all?"

If you do bleach eventually, use the lowest possible developer. Alotta people use 30 (or even 40), and sometimes it‚Äôs called for. But I develop with 20. I only bleach down to light brassy orange (I‚Äôm naturally about a level 3), but that works for my blue. 
Many ‚Äúfun‚Äù hair colors are deposit only. Look up your brand online of the packaging isn‚Äôt clear!  Good luck and maybe post a pic when you‚Äôre finished!"
haircoloring,fnf3489,t3_g1e04c,1586900531.0,"Yup, just add more pink!  I‚Äôve had a blue streak in my hair for many years, it fades to an ugly muddy green.  I reapply my blue about once a month. I only bleach new growth about every six months. DO NOT BLEACH OVER ALREADY BLEACHED HAIR!  Sorry to yell but I have been there and had the breakage to prove it!

Edit - I didn‚Äôt see you‚Äôd already been talked outta bleaching again!  Also, just be sure your pink is deposit only.  I know a girl who uses purple but it works like regular color, as in it lifts and deposits. Assuming it is deposit only color (for instance I use Ion from Sally‚Äôs), you can apply heat to accelerate the color, and can leave it on for quite a while!  Good luck!

BipolarReddit,fndu7go,t1_fncmeo5,1586877572.0,"Yup, tested positive the end of March. For me it was a bit like the flu, started with body aches and fatigue and just that general shitty feeling. Fever bounced around as high as 101.5, but I was taking Tylenol every four hours so would‚Äôve probably spiked higher if I hadn‚Äôt. 

Fever lingered for weeks, went down to normal for 36 hours, then back up. I‚Äôd say I felt truly sick about a week, and the rest has just been lingering fatigue and intermittent stomach pains with diarrhea. I had some chest congestion, not extreme, and I‚Äôm a smoker. Never had a cough. Lost my senses of taste and smell a few days in, it took about 10 days to start coming back and now it‚Äôs at probably 75%.
