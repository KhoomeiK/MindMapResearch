You’ll get there."

I’m sure you’ll smash the last 20lbs.x"

The demon scientists injected all sorts of concoctions into the prototype’s knees over a period of several years, but were unable to rectify the deformity, so they sold him to the ogres (for a handsome price) as the ogres wanted to be the first to try human meat."

Cringetopia,fpvx0j5,t1_fpvsv1q,1588953349.0,"Aw man. That comment was only in jest. Brits like to poke fun at Americans. Satire is a big part of that. It’s all light hearted. 

It’s obviously not normal for any parent to sit through that entire thing with a straight face 😂"
