AskReddit,etjbnoh,t3_cbw727,1562870227.0,Zork Grand Inquisitor. It was a point and click adventure game based on the text only game of the same name. The puzzles and humor were on point. I recently replayed it with a friend and it still holds up. It's pretty old so unless zork becomes popular again I can't see a sequel happening.
