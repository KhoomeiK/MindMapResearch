I have come to realize more about the way I used to portray myself: self-deprecating humor as a huge defense tool even with people I had good relationships with. Those friends stayed in Illinois. My wife, two small children and I moved here to Arizona. Made a few friends here but not like in my old group. Felt like an outsider, disrespected even on nights out with co-workers. Not all these co-workers purposely put me low in any social grouping, but plenty did. I have one really good friend I met through work about 5 years ago.

In my marriage.

After 33 plus years together, plus some fairily
sly bhealth scares moirltre like friends and roommates than a romantic couple. 
Developing ""couples friends"" is tough. It doesn't help that my wife and I don't really care for my buddie's wife. Bb
I know I am just ranting about my own issues, sorry. 

I hope I get a couple responses, maybe a little advice or encouragement
