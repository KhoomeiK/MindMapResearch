BraveNewWorld,evvblmq,t1_evggawt,1564829929.0,"In my opinion, no. It was like an addiction, and she didn't know how to function with negative feelings.  The other people who lived in the old world were completely fine, because they weren't accustomed to a life without pain or choices. I think the whole point is that yes, people did survive well in the new world, and lived long, ""happy"" lives. The new world is not supposed to be perceived by readers as entirely objectively unpleasant. The question the book poses is whether we want a lifetime of artificial happiness, beauty, and health in replacement of individual thought, love, and the growth that comes from having challenges and decisions in life."

BraveNewWorld,eso0nwv,t3_c1f9yy,1562156575.0,"BNW presents an entirely hedonistic way of life: the meaning of life is for one to be happy, that is all. The expense paid for this ""happiness"" in BNW is the loss of relationships, questioning, knowledge, philosophy, and any deeper meaning than sensational pleasure. Everyone numbs bad sensations. It also is the loss of individual drive -- everyone is predestined to their class, and there is no change or even desire to change their station. It is a life without meaning, depth, or challenge. Linda is an example of what happens when someone is taken away from the simulated happiness in the society, is no longer able to numb negative experiences, and is forced to question her ""beliefs."" She crumbles, because she is not able to handle questioning or challenges. The question, then, is whether or not we can have true happiness or joy without overcoming challenges and obstacles in life."
Dyshidrosis,ere5nrc,t3_c1kdpp,1560774439.0,"I've been there. I'm so sorry, I know it's so painful. For bad flare ups I use Eczema Honey and wear cotton gloves when I sleep. The gloves also help keep me from scratching. I put a shea butter based lotion on top of the Eczema Honey. (Chagrin Valley makes a good one. I try to avoid too many additives to avoid irritants). I also will first use Chagrin Valley's Sea Buckthorn herbal salve on the open cracked parts. It's expensive, but a little goes a long way, and it's helped me more than Neosporin with healing. Good luck!"

socialwork,epwglw6,t3_bv1lrr,1559575331.0,"There's actually books by that title: ""Days in the Lives of Social Workers."" It's a series, and they provide a great overview of many different areas of social work. I've worked in a few areas, but generally you'll do a lot of documentation (just like nursing), a lot of returning phone calls, and a lot of client interaction. Depending on the area, that may be with people in crisis or not. It may be more therapeutic or more based in referrals and case management. No matter what, you'll use skills learned in active listening and empathy throughout each day. There's tons of options for careers in Social Work. Good luck!"
