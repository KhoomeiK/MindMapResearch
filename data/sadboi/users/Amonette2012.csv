Do you have a bathtub?  Or a large box with low sides you can put a tray in?  Mine seem to like it if it's in something like that, and it cuts down on scatter.

It might take a while to learn, but just be patient and carry on reinforcing.  Possibly with a different litter box though.  Can you perhaps just take the top off the one you have for now?"

You could build them a catio style run - basically a chickenwire enclosure with a cat tree, some shade, a bit of scratching space.

Or you can leash train them.  Leash training is a great option however you raise your cat.  If you hope to let them spend time outdoors later on, leash walking can introduce them to dogs, traffic and so on. 

It's best for both cat and the general environment not to let them roam unwatched - outdoor cats don't live as long on average due to the chance of accidents, infection, encounters with wildlife, traffic, etc.  

Cats left to roam can be very destructive to local nature.  

A happy medium is an enclosed outdoor area and regular walking.  If I had the space pictured, I'd create a cat-safe area for them to chill in."

JustNoSO,fqkqw7x,t3_gj9qga,1589433799.0,"Sometimes arguments happen.  Especially at times like these, when we're kind of stuck together without our usual outlets.

I come from a very similar background to you, and I know exactly how you are feeling here.  One thing I had to come to realize is that my husband isn't like that, and he isn't seeing it on the same level.

I feel that it's possible that he's really stressing out, and that he's felt under pressure to get your birthday right, and freaked out from the pressure.  It sounds like he is possibly missing an outlet here, and his 'gummy bag' (the little sack of misery that we all stuff things into until they explode) has filled up and exploded.

If I might offer advice (not sure if you want it as I can't see a flair, sorry if I just missed it) - try not to have a reaction right now.  Try to let it play out without adding more fuel to the fire, and see what happens.  Take the 'strong but peaceful' path and give him some space to get over whatever thing it is that he's stressing over is.  

When my husband gets this way, there's usually a reason for it.  I tend to give him space for a bit, until he has chilled out, eaten, slept, and seems to be no longer preoccupied, then I ask if there's something bothering him that I don't know about, and ask if he wants to talk about it or needs any support.  Every time I've done this, it's turned out that he had something going on that he hadn't told me about yet (because he is very much a lone wolf, and he is just starting to share things with me instead of trying to deal with them on his own after four years of marriage).

Get to a place where you can have a rational, calm conversation in which he shares his feelings/ thoughts/ issues, and you share with him the way you felt during this encounter, and the effect it had on you.  In a calm way.

It's hurtful when your loved one makes a childish comment about you.  Sometimes my husband does that.  Sometimes I do.  It is 99.99% of the time something we regret saying.  Sometimes we act out in weird ways that we don't understand.  

Relationships have some weird patches.  The situation you describe is similar in spirit to some situations that we have survived, so I just wanted to give a hopeful note there and think the best of this, given that this is such a stressy time all around.

The long term 'is this a red flag' question is; does this happen often, and, if so, is it something you've tried and failed to solve using solid tools (e.g. therapy, working on it together etc) or is it something that happens occasionally that you haven't really worked out a way of dealing with as a couple yet?  If this happens very frequently it could be a deep problem, but if it's more of an irregular fight pattern, it might just be that you need to find the right way to talk about it.  And that takes time.

Hugs to you, and, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! <3"

AmItheAsshole,fqje22n,t3_gj75sh,1589408633.0,"INFO - did she find it in the garden, do you think?  It's possible that in the past there might have been a fire pit or a charcoal storage bin.  We had something similar in my childhood home - there was a patch of the garden with a lot of coal in the soil because the house used to have a coal bin for the fireplace.  

If it's a fire pit, the chances are that it's perfectly safe and won't hurt the dog at all, because it's natural charcoal from regular wood. People don't tend to put extra chemicals on a bonfire, and if they do, it's at the beginning to start it, and it will be long burned off before the fire is down to coals.

However, if it might possibly have been a coal storage bin (if it's been in the ground a while it can be hard to tell the difference) - that's not so good.  

I'd do some literal digging here and see if you can a) figure out what the source of this is and b) dig it out and throw it away before she gets into it again.

Then he went 'I will get the box for her, because I nebulously somehow think she will like it!' 

Honestly, once I got how husbands shop, I understood so many weird boyfriend/ husband presents.  One guy I lived with - he went to the shop and asked if I wanted anything.  I said 'Fruit please: grapes, if there are no grapes, apples, if there are no apples, any fruit.'

He only remembered the grapes bit, but DID remember that, if there were no grapes, I still wanted something to eat.  So, he bought me a pork pie.

He gave it to me, and I was like 'what the fuck  HOW did you come up with PORK PIE??'  And he went;  'I forgot the list!  And you LIKE pork pies!'

That was I guess the first point at which I started learning about this particular way of thinking.   I was so cross with him about that pie, and he was so confused.  Eventually I saw the funny side - mainly because of how much it baffled me; I mean; I said fruit! How did he reach 'pork pie??'

I think that sometimes, you can only communicate so far.  Some stuff you just have to decide to stop being mad about.  I say that as a general note, rather than in relation to your specific situation, but it's something I've found to be true in terms of the small things.  Sure, sometimes those have spoken to incompatibilities.  But, sometimes, the discussion of them has led to a balancing of expressions of love.

The worst thing you can do is NOT talk about it.  

Many hugs and good luck.

JustNoSO,fq8n499,t3_gh7puj,1589170168.0,"Gah this is such a guy brain-fart.  I can totally see my husband doing this without thinking it through.  They just do not always put two and two together.  He saw the box and thought you would like it as a box, and he told you it was empty, he just didn't think any further than that.  If my husband did this I would assume that he wasn't thinking 'I should get my wife a proper gift,' more 'oo pretty box, wife will like that, I will get it for her.'  I would absolutely not expect him to even realize that it was a gift box.

I can see why you're pissed but unless he's usually a thoughtless twerp, I think this is a man brain-fart.  And he probably feels bad about it.  

Also, some people are not natural gift givers - it's not everyone's love language.   In the future, you can do things like going 'so, shall we set a budget for gifts?'  Lists are super helpful - you could plan out the year and decide how much to spend each for valentines, mothers and fathers days, birthdays etc, maybe a spreadsheet even, and you could link him the item you want as a gift.  Then he a) knows you want a gift, and b) knows what to get you.  

It's like my husband and groceries.   He will absolutely go to the grocery store and forget every item we actually need if I don't give him a list."

And nail bars are a really bad idea right now in any case, I was just reading the other day about an outbreak linked to a nail bar.

Why on earth did she do this?  Is that part of the family like, really anti-shutdown and doing it in protest?"

Edit: also, you're 18 and engaged?  You're rushing too fast here.  This is how women end up with awful, abusive, controlling men.  He's trying to lock you down so he can abuse you more easily."
