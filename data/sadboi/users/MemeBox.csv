loseit,fq5w0rt,t1_fq5t9q9,1589118931.0,"Imagine your body like a bucket. It has hole in the bottom, this is your body losing heat. The water level is your temperature. As the water trickles out of the hole the water level drops. This is like the heat you lose from your skin.

Your body produces heat to replace the heat that is lost from your skin. This is like the bucket being refilled from the top.

Drying the wet t-shirt means evaporating the water. That takes energy, it takes energy to evaporate water. Wearing the wet t shirt is like increasing the size of the hole in the bucket, more water flows out - more heat is lost from your body. The body likes to stay the same temperature, so it increases the amount of heat it is producing. This is like increasing the amount of water flowing into the bucket to keep water level the same despite the bigger hole for the water to flow out from.

Using a fan increases the amount of water that is evaporating from the t-shirt and so makes the hole in the bucket even larger - making the body produce more heat to match it.

If you do the math, like I have above, you see that this is actually a large amount of energy as it takes a lot of energy to take water and evaporate it.

That energy used by the body to maintain it's temperature, to keep the water level in the bucket steady, that takes calories. Which of course means using reserves of carbohydrates, fat reserves or protein reserves. Which of course means weight loss - provided you don't just eat more to compensate."

The body carefully balances the amount of heat production to keep the body at 37.5 degrees centigrade. If we lose more heat to the environment, e.g. swimming in cold water, the body increases our metabolism, increases respiration and generates more heat to keep our body at 37.5 degrees.
