mentalillness,fr0h3c5,t3_glulna,1589795422.0,"This won't mean much but I feel you and wish you the best. Try to look at life with a future in mind. Try to come up with something you'd wanna try or something you'd like to achieve in the future.

This may sound bad in the beginning but make a list of things you wanna try/do before you die. 
If you have a list of 10 things and then you're gonna end it after, chances are when doing those things you'll find a reason to wanna stay alive. Be it having a partner, or maybe advancing in a career path. I know it can be really though to motivate yourself. 

Even if you stand in the mirror looking at yourself and hating yourself, there is someone out there that loves you. You've probably impacted other people's lives in a positive way that you haven't even thought about it.

If you don't mind me asking, what kind of music do you make? I LOVE music. I listen to almost everything and I like create my own music aswell. If you're comfortable sharing a SoundCloud or similar I would love to have a listen!

IsItBullshit,fppdua4,t3_geollu,1588800475.0,"No bullshit. The fact that America hasint cought up yet is amazing.

In a small town in the middle of Sweden there are two intersections connecting a major road that goes through a large part of that ""state"". One of these is a 4 way and the other is a T intersection. There are roughly 11 fatal accidents a year on either of these. In (I think) 2017 they changed those to temporary roundabout (as in just big tires in a circle in the middle) because of some construction work. These stayed for 1-1,5years. And in this time they were up there were 0 accidents in these intersections. Not fatal accidents, just 0 accidents. (There were a few from people driving of the round when slippery ECT. But neither of those had anything to do with the intersections).

YET the city decided to remove those temporary roundabouts and bring back the intersections when the construction was complete. Even though many citizens complained. 

So yeah, that's my story that (imo) proves how roundabouts are better than intersections."

Why would your sister be mad at you? It's not like you say down, looked Daniel in the eyes and though him the word, meaning, & pronunciation of the word ""shit"".

You were doing your sister a favour by driving her son to an appointment, some jackass puts you & her son in danger, you manage to swerve away so her son doesn't get into an accident. You accidentally say the word ""shit"" a few times out of pure panic (probably ?).

Now tell me again how your sister has any reason to be mad at you?
I've never understood people getting mad for teaching their kid a ""bad word"". The kids don't know the meaning. To them it's just a word. Unless you sit down and teach them but even then it's not so bad. Because if they know the meaning then it's an good opportunity to teach them that you shouldn't say or do things unless they fit the situation."

When you've installed xampp. Open the control panel and press start on the servers you need. Php development needs the apache server and the mysql server for your database. Then head over to a browser and go to localhost or 127.0.0.1.

You should see your website with the basic xampp site. Now to start editing the page.
For this instance i'm gonna sssume yo know basic html.

Navigate to your xampp install folder (default is: C:/xampp (if im not misstaken). Then navigate to the ""htdocs"" folder. This is where your site will ve.
Now you can start by deleting everything in there since it's just the xampp basic site.

Open your editor of choice. I use Atom because i like the simplicity and customibiliyy, but you're to choose which ever one you prefer. Notepad works (though i would'nt recommend it).
Now in your editor open up a new file. And just put in basic html to get a site going.

Save it as ""index.php"" and save it in the htdocs folder in your xampp installation. 

Go into the website (localhost / 127.0.01) and refresh. You should see your new site there!
