Discordo do que alguns est√£o falando de ""vc tbm nao se atrai por outras pessoas?"" E afins. A real √© que porn√¥ √© basicamente a educa√ß√£o sexual masculina, normalizam assistir desde muito cedo e depois fica dif√≠cil se desvincular pq fica naturalizado. Eu tamb√©m me incomodava e tinha ciumes, fazia me sentir insegura, ate que resolvi assistir pra ver de qual era. Assisti mais vezes at√© me acostumar um pouco e vi que realmente n√£o √© nada demais. √â praticamente ums coisa mec√¢nica, pelo menos pra mim e imagino que pra v√°rias outras pessoas. √â uma receita f√°cil pra vc se excitar e se aliviar, e s√≥. Pra mim n√£o tem nem nada a ver com sentir atra√ß√µes por outros ou qualquer coisa assim.

Hoje n√£o assisto mais, mas por questoes ideologicas. Hoje tenho consci√™ncia dos efeitos da industria do porn√¥ na vida das atrizes e dos reflexos no comportamento sexual masculino. Conversei isso com meu namorado e com o tempo ele tambem acabou querendo parar de assistir.

Vc nao √© obrigada a achar ok seu namorado assistir, √© seu direito se incomodar, mas pra mim o maior problema ai n√£o √© nem ele assistir, mas a falta de interesse dele em dialogar e de respeitar algo que vc demonstrou que te faz mal e tals, n√£o querer nem conversar a respeito. Acho que era sobre isso q vc devia conversar em primeiro lugar."

I wanted to talk about it because I see so many girls saying how much they hate condoms but it's the least invasive contraceptive method for women, there are no colateral effects. 
I used condoms as protection with my boyfriend for 3 years, recently we stopped using and I felt a difference. It is intenser, I can feel a little bit more the texture and the temperature, but it isn't a giant difference. 
When I tell friends I wear condom as protection they get shocked, they say they hate it etc. I have a theory that normally their partners are the ones that hate it so much and convince them to no wear it and to hate it as well. Of course there are many women that really hate it, but I don't think it's so generalized. And pills are so much more negative to womens body, it supress our libido, I don't understand why women can hate so much condoms, i think its because its the only method that bothers men"

1 zucchini
1 cup of white vinegar (250 ml)
1 soup spoon of salt
750 ml of water
4 garlics
Olive oil
Pepperoni pepper


Recipe:
1) slice the zucchini using a slicer so they are around 1mm thick
2) boil the water and the vinegar together with a soup spoon of salt, then add the zucchini and let it simmer for 1 minute. Take it off and throw the water away. Let the zucchini cool off (you can put it in the freezer for 5 minutes).
3) dry the zucchini using paper towel. Take a glass jar and add a layer of zucchini, some pepper, a clove of garlic and cover it with olive oil until it's complete. Let it rest for at least 24h. It's great to eat with bread or in a salad!

At the moment I live with my parents and planning on moving ou soon, and I always thought the same as OP, that when I live alone I'm not getting a dog because of work and time, but then someone told me this and it made me rethink."

I never thought that sometimes it is better for the dog to spend some time alone than continue on his current situation. Thanks for sharing!"
