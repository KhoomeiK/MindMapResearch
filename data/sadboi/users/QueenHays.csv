piercing,fnn83gn,t1_fnn7s46,1587086475.0,It has been shallow since I got it after what I presume was swelling went down as it looked like that maybe 3 days after I got it. I’m cleaning it with the solution my piercer gave me called studex I think (I’ve tried to find the saline solution but can’t find any) and I do salt soaks at night.
piercing,fnn7eh7,t1_fnn71jq,1587086037.0,"It’s worth a shot, I’m to afraid to take it out in case it’s infected. This jewellery is titanium old one was stainless steel which in the past had made some of my piercings react weirdly. I can’t see a doctor either or a piercer."

I’ve had it done 3 times and 2 times it got bumps, I recently got it done a 3rd time but I have covered it with a plaster every single night (I thought maybe I was bumping it in my sleep). I haven’t had a nose bump at all.

If your doing proper cleaning I would try covering it. Also not touching it at all only when cleaning"
