oasis,f23pytn,t1_f23eo14,1569934397.0,"Start with ""Definitely Maybe"" then ""What's The Story Morning Glory"" then ""The Masterplan"" which is an amalgamation of b-sides. After that maybe check out Noel G's first two albums ""Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds"" and ""Chasing Yesterday"", if you don't mind synthesizers and shit also check out ""Who Built The Moon?"", his third solo album. Liam G's ""As You Were"" and ""Why Me? Why Not."" are also very good and more loyal to the OASIS formula in my opinion. AFTER all that if you're still into Oasis you should listen to the rest of their albums in this order (order of quality in my opinion):""Be Here Now""; ""Dig Out Your Soul""; ""Don't Belivet The Truth""; ""Heathen Chemistry"" and ""Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants"". ALWAYS GLAD TO SEE NEW FANS"
