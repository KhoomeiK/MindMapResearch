Also the low carb recommendations aren’t just for weightloss (although studies do show that does help pcos to an extent on its own.) low to no carb diets also HELP pcos. I’ll link an article about how low carb benefits people with pcos. [Top 8 reasons to adopt a low-carb diet for polycystic ovary syndrome](https://www.dietdoctor.com/low-carb/benefits/pcos/8-reasons) 

If you are large enough for bariatric surgery to be an option, then you’re diet isn’t ideal to begin with. If the way you eat now (hardly no meat or eggs, high carb, etc) isn’t right, then you need to tough it up and try your best to change it now before your condition gets a lot worse. Especially if you’re already experiencing weight related health issues such as elevated blood sugars from type 2 diabetics etc (which is what metformin is for).  It isnt going to be easy. If it was easy then no one would ever struggle with their weight because eating perfectly healthy would be easy and everyone would do it.

If your doubts are from doubting your ability to lose weight and though, and just seem like it’s over a resistance to lifestyle changes, I recommend seeing a dietician or weightloss therapist. They can work with you and actually change the way you think about food and your body to help facilitate the weightloss process and make it more attainable. There is a undeniable psychological aspect to weightloss that goes way beyond food consumption and exercise. Noom is an example of a program like this that is gaining a lot of popularity today, but you can also find many many books on this at much cheaper prices than the Noom program if you’re the type that would rather teach yourself.  

There are also many books you can download as PDFs for free. [THIS is one of my favorites. ](https://timetothrivetherapy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cognitive-Behavioral-Workbook-for-Weight-Management.pdf)  it’s the Cognitive Behavioral Workbook for Weight Management.

I hope you find a way to make the right choices (whatever they may be) for your condition, health, and happiness. And feel free to ask if you have any questions or if there’s any way at all I can help you on you."

Struggled with my weight all my life. Dieted since I was a child. Developed an eating disorder in college. Finally decided f it. I’m just going to be fat and start trying to be happy with myself (not quite working but I’m eating and I’ve gained a lot of weight but I’m also not crying every night or self harming or throwing up anymore so I’m saying it’s a victory.)

So cut to a couple nights ago when I was sitting with a coworker (58/m) . We don’t get a lunch break so I pulled a special k breakfast crisp thing out of my bad and was eating it while charting.

Him: can I ask you something and you promise you won’t be mad? Don’t be mad.

Me: okay....

Him: but have you ever thought about your weight? Because you’re almost as big as [our patient who is over 600lbs.]

He then goes on to tell me that he could start calling me at meal times and reminding me to eat healthy, that I could use his gym membership, that I’m such a pretty girl and “I’m just worried you’re getting close to the age where losing weight won’t be easy.” 

It was everything I could do not to be rude to him and bite my tongue. 

Yes I’ve worked with this guy for over two years, not no we’re not close at all and he had/has no right to be that comfortable telling me that HE is worried about MY body...

If he was my spouse? Sure. Let’s talk. My family? Sure. A friend even? Sure! But yeah not a coworker with some weird misogynistic dad complex who thinks he knows better than me."
