MadOver30,fjxmtt2,t3_ff2ofr,1583678206.0,"I totally understand. I have tried getting out and going to church and aerobics and Thai chi class and an art class. Classes cost money. I find I meet people but we never get beyond acquaintences who only speak at said event or class. I have tried volunteer work and it seemed to add stress but people were more like co-workers than friends. 

I used to have a few online friends but lost touch. I withdraw periodically and it confuses people. I'm in the exact same boat. I have trouble getting any closer than just acquaintances when I try to meet people. It's hard to make friends."
AskWomen,fjk2wux,t3_fdrwlj,1583418817.0,Most people I try to talk to stay in the acquaintance zone. People know me from church or work or aerobics class or whatever. They know my first name but not my number. But how to get from acquaintence to friend is beyond me. Most seem to not want to. The few times I truly tried it was too hard because the other women had kids and husbands and their whole life was about that. I have two sons that are adult but my life is quite different than a soccer mom's. Most women seem way too busy to hang out or talk.
KindVoice,fb7jx0a,t1_fb2n3kc,1576592209.0,Thank you for the information you added. I do need help and see a counselor today and my psych added a new medication to my mix.   Not sure what Reddit protocol is for adding updates. But we are no longer being evicted at least. We satisfied the public housing office with paperwork and at least for now have shelter. Still dealing with infections and lawsuits.
ChildofHoarder,fb5a3gv,t3_ebfhni,1576523817.0,"My mom is the same way. Only almost all her gifts are ratty old used things from yard sales and thrift shops. I have had to hurt her feelings more than once by telling her I no longer have something she presented to me. I've bluntly told her that I live in a one room studio apartment and if I kept everything she got me my place would look like hers. I tell her immediately when things have gaping holes, broken zippers that they aren't wearable. A few times I've caught her going through my trash when visiting and crying about discarded items. For several years part of her hoard occupied my home until I finally had to break her heart to regain my space. I notice whatever gifts she presents must be opened, touched, worn,shown to others, paraded and much made of them. the occasion is more about the thing than the person. It's a difficult time if year for all involved. For people obsessed with things this time of year is like gasoline on the fire."

You've experienced a great shock and great loss. Try to find a snail mail address to continue communication with your friend.  I am sure both of you need the comfort of hearing something from each other. I can imagine you are frought with worry. Try to take care of you. Take a long hot bath, make yourself eat when you don't want to eat. Try to nurse yourself a bit through this trauma with lots of self care."

BipolarReddit,f6r0ree,t3_dsmktz,1573090828.0,"I don't connect with mine on any deep emotional level but I consider her a very vital part of my safety net.  When I need a med change or increase or my psychiatrist needs called she's on the front lines and one of the first to notice and help me. She's making me work through a self esteem workbook. Part of me finds it almost comical enough to post on r/thanksimcured . Oh I serial wreck my life, and everyone around me is completely sick of my shit but I can sit and meditate on my core worth. Thanks. I do the homework to make her feel better. I figure we both need each other."
BipolarReddit,f2edk0s,t3_dd2pxn,1570191977.0," Getting diagnosed is not easy. Getting treated is not easy. Navigating systems is not easy. Most people are misdiagnosed at first before the clinicians start to put the puzzle together. Sometimes we drag ourselves in for counseling only when we are depressed but stop treatment and disappear from clinic altogether when manic, and they never see us in both phases.

Maybe you have had episodes before but weren't aware of it. I have had people tell me I am acting manic while completely unaware. I looked back on certain bad decisions I made and now see a pattern, but at the time wouldn't have thought I was manic. Some people are much more self aware than I am."

BipolarReddit,f14fjda,t1_f146qov,1569173981.0,Thanks for the advice. I regret so many past mistakes when I made poor choices during episodes that I'm afraid of trusting my choices. This is reassuring to hear.
BipolarReddit,f13cp9t,t3_d7pybx,1569158268.0,"   It's exhausting isn't it?  Breathe while you can.  The anxiety I suffered during my last med change was so crippling I can really relate to your description of pacing and jumping out of your skin. I am glad at least that part is getting better. 

You have a real gift for writing. You have an ability to articulate things with words that paint a picture. You should write more you are like a voice for us who can't find the words to describe this stuff!"
BipolarReddit,f13b6gi,t1_f1395rb,1569157627.0,"Details are basically caring for a paralyzed loved one who had trouble obtaining home health care due to medicaid and other problems.  I don't think I will speal about catheters and bandage changes and specifics because my main concern is my ability to trust myself or not. I'm just not sure how to tell if I'm being smart, or stupid again. You know how in the past in an episode you can be so sure you are doing the right thing. The history of mistakes with bipolar can really really rob your ability to trust yourself you know? So how do we know? Ever?"
lonely,f0tkr82,t3_d6dan9,1568923965.0,Congratulations on surviving to write that. Did you know you can get emergency psych help by walking into an emergency room?  They may transfer you to a psych ward for a week or so to begin antidepressants or they may refer you to a counselor through county mental health and give you an appointment depending on how in danger you are. If you need help there are options. It's a long battle to claw your way out of that level of depression and it usually takes medicine and therapy. There is a way to heal but it's a slow process. I urge you to call your county mental health services or ask your family doctor for a referral to a mental health professional. Another option is the spiritual route and talk to a priest pastor clergy of whatever your faith is. I just urge you to not fight the darkness all alone get help.
lonely,ezjnmyg,t3_d11ie8,1567947360.0,"On facebook I posted some group photos of me with groups of other people that are not really friends. These were things like ladies in my exercise class that took a group photo, and a group photo of fellow volunteers at a volunteer project. Even though most of them don't speak to me outside of class/ volunteer work, the group photos on my facebook made it look like we are closer than we really are. 

People at work that have been treating me like I was a diseased pariah seemed to sigh with relief and made a lot of comments about how happy I look with my friends. Now all the sudden they act less afraid of me or treat me less like a wierdo. I don't want to lie, but I also can't bring myself to correct them. I just change the subject."

BipolarReddit,eyf5u7p,t3_cwobjw,1567043872.0,I recommend downloading a mood tracker app for your phone. Many free ones are available. Sometimes it will graph out highs and lows for you and you can start to see certain patterns for yourself.
AskWomen,ey81yrc,t3_cvtqzy,1566908980.0,"Many. BUt one of the worst was my middle school (jr. high) physical.

I was 12 and it devastated me."
BipolarReddit,ey3vkkq,t1_exdevbc,1566774852.0,Thanks for replying. I didn't taper down because I was only on 20s. after a week off latuda I was started on Geodon so that's what I'm trying next. Med changes remind me of Mr. Toad's wild ride.
bipolar,ey2roqz,t1_ey1uu6y,1566746744.0,"I hope we both can find rest, home, belonging. Yes. I wish you the best. I am so utterly grateful for my family right now. And the fact it is a largeish family helps because I can go from one family members house to a different family members house for something to do, or a place to be, at least for a little bit.  I am also grateful for the fact churches, whatever the belief or denomination at all, are usually accepting of strangers wandering in and sitting. At least that often gives me some place to go and be around people when I'm just sitting in my car and have no idea what to do with myself. 

Strangely though, I've never felt more ""free"" from being tied to anything. I have no pet. Not even a plant to go home and water. Nothing at all to tie me to any one place. I just wander, float, and exist in a various chain of places until time to go to the next place."
BipolarReddit,exbfsdp,t3_ck35t0,1566130265.0,"I searched for this subject because I am having trouble with latuda. I was having severe akisthesia symptoms and could not tolerate those any more, but every time I tried to skip the latuda I would have panic attacks and severe anxiety.  I am sick one way if I take Latuda and sick another way when I don't take Latuda. It came down to which was worse, the withdrawal anxiety or the akisthesia. Akisthesia won. I can't take it any longer.

 I finally called my psych and left a message that I could not tolerate the akisthesia any longer Doc had added proponolol and stuff trying to ease the akisthesia so its something I've been fighting a while, and it's a horrible side effect. I can't live like that.

 My last dose was Wednesday. It's Sunday. I'm going through utter hell. My biggest withdrawal seems to be severe anxiety with a few all out panic attacks, and severe muscle tension. How did you get through this? How long does withdrawal last? I am looking for any information I can get."
BipolarReddit,exbebq0,t3_crtarq,1566129322.0,"The last time I was manic, I had several friends and relatives tell me I was manic before I started to even consider it.  I'm not always aware of it when it is hitting. I have to trust what other people are telling me. Then again it's important to only do this with your closest people you trust. Some people will brush off every emotion, bad day, complaint or tear as just you being bipolar when it is you being human or having legitimate concerns.  It helps to have some people like a sibling, best friend, or parent that know you so well that you can really trust when they tell you you seem manic."
BipolarReddit,evz2cbx,t3_cljppw,1564947236.0,"Any change in routine at all throws me for a thousand loops. But once it becomes a part of my daily rythm it actually kind of helps, as long as its a regular routine. I am not sure how long it takes for something new and scary to become that familiar routine feeling. Might be quite a while. Hang in there. I know it is super, super hard and yes can be triggering. Just try to push through it. I am not sure how many weeks it will take but it WILL get better.  Don't be afraid to mention it to your doctor. They might offer help."
BipolarReddit,euw808d,t3_choeio,1564071958.0,"I am in  the same boat. I have 24k or so in student loan debt but due to my mental struggles was never able to succeed or handle being a full teacher. I am living in an income based (housing highrise) apartment and working as a low wage teacher's aide instead. I made the mistake of opening paypal credit. they kept raising the limit. I can never pay it back. A lot of it was stuff I used for the kids at school or surviving summers with no pay check. I've been dodging phone calls and scared. I don't know what's going to come of it. For the student loan I keep applying for ""income based"" repayment. I am way over my head for someone that can barely keep a vehicle running. Feels like most of my income goes to a car (insurance, license registration fees, fuel ) just to go back and forth to work. There's no public transport here. I feel like I am in some hole I can't escape from. I know exactly what you mean by STUCK. I feel stuck too. When manic I am so so certain I can just ""work more"" ""get another job"" anything sounds possible. But then, reality hits when I come down and spend 3 months applying and interviewing getting NOWHERE, and trying to fit in appointments and get enough sleep..."
BipolarReddit,eukvwh6,t3_cgmkna,1563893769.0,"Worse I make a decision and change my mind 20 times as I am trying to execute the decision. This seems most dangerous when trying to drive and choose a route. I have pulled over, turned around, changed directions, rather abruptly and sometimes change my mind in the middle of a left turn or something. I have to control my impulse to change direction mid turn or some such. I might start to prep one meal throw half prepared food in the fridge and start something else. I have half finished projects everywhere. As soon as I pick one thing up I change my mind and move to something else. I can make a decision just can't stick to it at all."

Every time I try to make friends with another woman she  is  wearing a bunch of screaming little humans, worried about soccer practice and supper, has one boob out feeding somebody, and has absolutely no time to talk to me. I feel like when I go to exercise classes or church or anywhere I'm the only person that is single and doesn't have a bazillion kids all over me. And it's kind of hard to relate or talk to other people who are living a vastly different life than me, and they are all far far far too busy for the likes of me.  I finally tried to befriend much older seniors thinking well their life is therefore closer to mine... but then they don't understand the whole being busy having to work all day thing. They schedule all their get togethers at ten in the morning or some such and I just get left out, and they quickly end up upset that I can't reply fast enough or get too busy for them in the day hours.

BipolarReddit,etfbo6z,t3_cbewj7,1562765815.0,"It just doesn't fit the typical pattern they see. Most of us have done EXTREMELY foolish, rash, impulsive things with money while manic, and that becomes something they are used to seeing. MOST of us have run up some credit card debt when we felt so CONFIDENT we'd get 5 jobs or become a famous artist or whatever we were thinking when we thought we could pay it back easily.... and then get in trouble when reality slams on us like a concrete freeway in an earthquake. Oh wait that's the depression. But I don't think you have to spend money to be bipolar, it's just what they are used to seeing. You've broken the mold but not every symptom in the DSM is about that. I think you have to meet a certain number of symptoms, impulsive decisions are probably only ONE of them, and I'm sure impulsive decisions can involve sex or lots of other things besides money."
