If you would rather be the one to have that discussion, there are some things you could try--making it about the baby, making it based on a doctor's orders (even if it's not yours, mixing household and generations have been discouraged by many cliniciand)...but how she reacts and whether she gets angry is entirely on her, not you.

povertyfinance,fobj3tm,t3_g6oost,1587660331.0,"Seconding the prenatal vitamins, will help keep deficiencies from affecting her and will help keep the baby from having developmental health issues.



For pregnancy, she won't need too much besides adequate nutrition and prenatal healthcare. Preventing health problems is good for her and baby, of course, but is also much cheaper than fixing health problems. Maternity clothes can be found easily at thrift stores as can newborn clothes, and you can make a few maternity shirts and pants stretch a long way if you rewear them or can supplement with PJ bottoms and stretchy sweaters, especially since she won't show too badly until it cools down assuming she is in the northern hemisphere. 



For baby, she will need diapers, wipes, food (either formula or nutrition/pump for herself to breastfeed), a safe place for baby to sleep, and clothes. I know they're not everyone's cup of tea, but cloth diapers are much cheaper since they're reusable and there are organizations that will [provide cloth diapers to low income families for free to reduce start up cost.](https://www.ethicalandchic.com/free-cloth-diapers-for-low-income-families/) . She will also need to plan childcare if she is planning to work afterwards. This is not a small issue: childcare is prohibitively expensive in some locations, so she will need to either budget for it or find a cheaper alternative like a family member.

Edit: it sounds like some counseling would be very beneficial, both for exploring her options relative to her personal history and for detailing what she'll need to do if she does decide to keep the baby. It might also be good to help work out her relationship with baby dad and her family."

BabyBumps,flbgwbm,t3_fntryn,1585004383.0,"Absolutely. I see a lot of comments noting that the partner is likely living in the same house as the laboring mom and is likely to have the same things which makes sense...to a point. Maybe they picked something up recently. Maybe they're more susceptible than the mom for whatever reason. Maybe their routine is different and they were exposed somewhere the other parent hasn't been. Maybe they have exactly the same risk as the mom, but the laboring parent HAS to be there for a medical procedure and the other parent doesn't. 

I think perhaps equally as important, if the other parent is at home, there's one fewer person likely to pick something up from the hospital and spread it. Obviously hospital staff are doing everything they can to avoid hospital-acquired infections, but every additional person is more risk of spreading things back into the community.

I am 4 weeks out from my due date, and while my hospital hasn't implemented this yet I'm scared they will. If they do I will be terrified, my SO will be out of his mind with worry....and I know the staff are aware of that. If I'm trusting them with my and my child's life through delivery, I have to trust they have evaluated the risks as being more significant than the well known benefits of a support person."

I know I am very fortunate to have an SO willing to put his foot down and keep it down, but it is for the safety of his wife and daughter. His attitude is that if they don't care enough to modify their routine to keep us (and them!) safe, he doesn't care enough to coddle their feelings re: not being allowed to come.

My response to the 'how can I tell them they can't see their grandchild' is something to the effect of 'are you telling me their feelings over a (temporary) inability to interact with their grandchild are more important than her and my safety/chances of ending up in the hospital?'...but I'm grouchy and uncomfortable, so not the most tactful right now."

BabyBumps,fkzucu1,t3_flo6t3,1584680634.0,"No ideas about a virtual shower, just commiserating on the loss of an in person shower. Mine was supposed to be this weekend and it was canceled on Sunday. I miss the celebration, I'm wondering how getting stuff will go, but I really could use some time with family right now and not being able to see them sucks.

I love the idea of a virtual one! My family isn't super tech heavy so it's not an option for us, but I'll be curious to hear what you come up with :)"

BabyBumps,fkun6tg,t3_fkt7th,1584552525.0,"Thank you ❤ Due end of April but am at a higher risk of going early due to preeclampsia.....and I'm in quarantine while I wait for testing to come back. Cannot begin to describe how hard it is to keep my fear tamped down right now. 

You're right, it will pass, and worrying won't change anything.

Thank you."

BabyBumps,fkr7f1l,t3_fk61q5,1584463303.0,"It is so bizarre right now. 35wks with hypertension/preeclampsia, and just got stuck in self-quarantine for testing after a possible positive came in to our work. The preeclampsia has been mild but I'm terrified that something will happen while I'm waiting on results and can't go to the doctor like normal.

Best of thoughts to other mamas!"
