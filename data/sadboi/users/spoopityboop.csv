AskReddit,flkc468,t3_fp5kk9,1585238109.0,"The first time my current boyfriend ate me out - mostly because I wasn‚Äôt expecting it. My ex hadn‚Äôt liked to so I had to ask, and so up until that point I thought I could only cum when touching my clit, during sex or otherwise. So usually I‚Äôd let partners eat me out for a few minutes, then we‚Äôd go it. 

I did enjoy it though, and this time he came up to me while I was working on a project so I just let him go at it while I worked, figuring we‚Äôd fuck when I finished. 

It felt really good, and it started getting harder and harder to focus, until at one point, I just decided to put the laptop down and just enjoy until whenever he decided he was tired. It was only a few minutes later that I began to feel the buildup. I thought ‚Äúno way,‚Äù but then it got more intense, even more intense than I remembered my first orgasm at its peak. I was just beginning to wonder how much more I could take when it happened. 

Y‚Äôall I fucking exploded. I shattered into a million pieces. My body was spasming and rolling from side to side, I think I almost took his head off. (And when I was done he looked up at me with the biggest, cockiest grin.)

Turns out all I needed to cum that was was to stop thinking about it so much, and have a guy who was willing to persevere. It‚Äôs never been that good again, but damn if it hasn‚Äôt been close every time."

Freshman year is like that for a lot of people, and it gets better, but when you‚Äôre in it it feels like it will never end and it looks like everyone around you is doing better. 

It also sounds like your friend might have some slight mental health issues, anxiety or depression or something. (I‚Äôm no doctor, but i‚Äôve been there, and between him being gay and the whole funny guy thing he kind if fits the profile.) sometimes when you have an episode of self doubt the easiest thing to do is shout into the void of the internet.

The best thing you can do for your friend is just reach out to him. You could mention the post, or just tell him you miss him. If you find that college is kind of a struggle for you too in some way, let him know, maybe it will help him feel like what he‚Äôs going through is normal. The most important thing is to just be there. If I hadn‚Äôt had my high school boyfriend and my two best friends, the beginning of college would have broken me.

 My junior year of college, my roommate started a strings group with this goofy freshman I knew in passing because we were both Theatre majors. 

Around that time, I had just ‚Äúmade it‚Äù into the group chat for this group of mostly-theatre majors who were all friends. They were the proverbial ‚Äúcool kids,‚Äù and until then I‚Äôd been somewhat of an outcast, for bs reasons that aren‚Äôt that important here. 

Also in that chat were a group of freshmen. The one in the string group with my roommate, I‚Äôll call him Cameron, seemed like he was getting picked on a lot. I was new, and thought it was all in good fun since he seemed to be a sport about it, so I left it alone. Until one night, when three of the girls in the group seemed to pretty drunk, and got a little meaner. It was cleanly hurting Cameron‚Äôs feelings, so I messaged him privately saying I didn‚Äôt think what they were doing was ok and he didn‚Äôt deserve it. He said thanks, and we ended up talking for a long time about the program and the string group and fitting in in general. 

Because of that conversation and his connection to my roommate, the three of us became pretty good friends. 

Meanwhile, this guy Jim who I don‚Äôt know, from the Business school starts dating one of the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù girls (though not one of the ones being mean that night). Because they‚Äôre dating, and he‚Äôs always liked Theatre, he decides to try out for Oklahoma with us. Through the course of the production, the girl breaks up with him, but he becomes friends with Cameron. 

After the show is over, whenever my roommate and I invite Cameron out, he invites Jim along with us. I start to realize he‚Äôs VERY VERY cute, which is a problem, because I have a boyfriend of five years. I think it‚Äôll blow over, but the four of us get along great and we start having movie nights once a week into senior year. Eventually I realize by comparison that my own relationship has been stale for a year and a half, so I leave it. Do some major growing. 

Fast forward: It‚Äôs been three years since all that. Jim, Cameron and I live in an apartment with one other friend from college. Jim and I have been together for two years and I‚Äôve never loved anyone or anything more. If we ever get married, I think we‚Äôll ask Cameron to officiate, lol. 

TL;DR: I reached out to someone I saw being bullied, and some guy I didn‚Äôt know dated some girl I barely knew. In the end, we fell in love."

My point is, studies like these that are surveys based on reported information cannot possibly be considered conclusive. There‚Äôs no science behind asking people to answer survey questions, there are too many complicating factors involved. Happiness itself is subjective. What are they even defining as happiness? Fulfillment? More fun? Less stress? The word doesn‚Äôt have a unified meaning. You can‚Äôt simply dictate what would make everyone happier buy looking at what kade some people happy. 

And you talk about people ‚Äúunable to ignore their biological link‚Äù as though they‚Äôre victims of their own biology or something? Our biology is part of is.

Edit: Several very thoughtful and insightful comments have led me to say I‚Äôd like to rescind this comment. I saw a bad sampling of a sub that is there for support for a group of people who are given a hard time for what should be an innocuous and personal choice. The pressure to have children can be hard, especially on young women, and in a world where that pressure is more common than uncommon, it‚Äôs good that there‚Äôs a community to talk about that.

(That said: I still stand by my position that calling people who have/want children ‚Äúbreeders‚Äù is weird, condescending, and hypocritical. Don‚Äôt do that.)"

OR, I spend all day typing typing typing for work and there are books I want to read but trying to look at more blocks of text when I get home is exhausting. 

OR, I still like to read, but a lot of my reading is done online now, and for some reason even though much of it is intelligent, thought-provoking, and well written, elitists still don‚Äôt see it as a valid medium.

Acting is about finding characters and moments yourself, not going off of what some writer told you to do. WWE is not a good example to look at if you actually want to learn to act in any other situation. 

It would be better for you and your teacher to start from scratch on finding moments in this script than for you to learn it with all the direction here and for your teacher have to help you unlearn it. It takes twice as long, so you won‚Äôt learn as much. Trust us here. Get rid of the directions. Reinterpret."
