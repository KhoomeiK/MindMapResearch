actuallesbians,fqr50mt,t1_fqqmwwj,1589577708.0,"""It just feels so wrong for people to say that my lesbian identity can include the very thing that people have pushed me to like.""

That's not what anyone is saying though.
They're saying that some lesbians don't have issues with penis - it's not a disqualifying physical feature for a woman to have. You can choose not to be with a woman who has a penis in the same way you can choose not to be with a woman who smokes. It's your preference. 

You don't get to then say, well it feels wrong to me that people get to include smokers as lesbians (even though they're women and attracted to women) because I don't want to fuck them.

I urge you to think about what you're saying here: ""attracted exclusively to female sexual characteristics"". That's some bigoted rhetoric. Trans women can have plenty of feminine secondary sexual characteristics (breasts, softer skin, less hair, etc). Sometimes they also have penises. I'm a cis woman whose genetics have blessed me with hirsutism and bulky muscles. There are plenty of feminine secondary sexual characteristics I don't have. Plenty of women wouldn't want to be in a relationship with me but they don't tell me that I'm not a woman or a lesbian because I have arms like Robin Williams."
BPD,fqpqvsm,t1_fqopj1f,1589552272.0,"That's a tough question to answer, I have had similar experiences because I have 3 siblings.

Each child is born with a different temperament. Some kids need more reassurance basically from the beginning. Some kids are wired more independently. Some kids have more challenges regulating their emotions. This may be explained by functional differences in the brain for people diagnosed with bpd, for example.


Individual experiences within a family still vary. For example, I was a physically sick child in a way my siblings were not. I had to have surgery at a pretty young age and I remember how my parents dealt with that stress (not well). I felt guilty for their stress, distant from my siblings and peers and lonely from an extremely young age.

Add to this, some of my older siblings were out of the household before some shit hit the fan, so they managed to escape some of the more glaring parentification/ enmeshment that I took on when some disruptive things happened in the family before I was 18. 

Sometimes people who seem to be more functional are just better at compartmentalizing. I have a sibling who is very good professionally (had success in school and jobs that I did not) but has been in a series of emotionally abusive relationships, for example.

Just my thoughts. I don't think science has the complete answer for bpd. There are a multitude of contributing factors."
BPD,fqlnovw,t3_gjfzwi,1589462456.0,"It took me 30 some years to realize how damaging my relationship with one of my parents was and how responsible I had always felt for their emotions.

Now, I'm trying to cope with the fact that I'm still in limited contact with someone who will never be able to acknowledge the pain they caused me in a genuine  (non-manipulative) way. I'm trying to get over the anger at that injustice and heal.

But it has taken so long. And even close friends who know how destructive that parent's behavior was are apologists for them. So I'm constantly having to fight feelings of guilt and self-doubt."

BPD,fo3ivqc,t3_g5fope,1587487644.0,"I thought for so long that I wouldn't have kids because I wanted to end the cycle of abuse. But there are multiple ways to do that. I don't treat my child the way my family of origin treated me. 

I won't ever have another kid because ppd was so bad and I wouldn't want my kid to see me like that. But  the people who interact with child or see me interacting with them give me nothing but positive feedback. And I have sought out feedback from external parties and professionals extensively.

It turns out, that being aware of the ways in which my parents failed me, I've avoided a lot of those behaviors and had a stronger understanding of what behaviors harm a kid.

There's no such thing as a perfect parent. All good parents seek to adapt how they act based on their individual child's needs. So long as you are actively engaging in your own treatment and listening when people express concerns about your behavior, I think you can be a good parent with bpd.

actuallesbians,fnzc4f9,t3_g4kgx3,1587391060.0,"It's courageous for you to share this story - especially when you say it's not something you talk about openly.

It's normal for that experience to still affect you. The way you discuss not feeling able to say no safely in sexual encounters - that's an understandable reaction - you are preventing yourself from feeling the pain of non consensual sex again. A lot of people who have experienced sexual trauma react the same way.

It can be hard to talk about these experiences with people you know - they don't always react in a way that centers your feelings and your experience.

That being said, pregnancy sucked for me and sleep deprivation was much harder on me than I expected based on how other people talked about their experiences.

And yet, the title of your post is ""sil has thrown my marriage into chaos"". So, your marriage is not what you thought. That happens to all kinds of people in all kinds of marriages.

latebloomerlesbians,fjk0yry,t3_fdqy3c,1583417525.0,"For me, bdsm is a separate drive from sex, but it was really important to me when I was closeted and engaging in sex only with men. I have found that it's a lot less important to me now - I used to not engage in sex with men unless there was some element of bdsm or humiliation involved. 

I do still really enjoy bdsm but it's not a must-have for sex like it was when I was with men and my urge to do it has decreased. I'm also enjoying more of it alone (tying myself up, corsetting, etc). The self-bondage stuff was a surprising turn on and really helped me get over a hump with desire / orgasm. 

I will say, sex with my wife is a lot less orgasm-focused and a lot more just enjoying sensation. It's a different experience of desire. I didn't expect that to change as much as it did. It's sort of like a different shape of desire.

I am not always the biggest fan of recommending this, but if cannabis is legal where you are, I find that thc really throws my desire up a few notches, especially edibles for some reason. Just a thought."

BPD,fixolnq,t3_faf6dr,1582824152.0,"The tantrums you describe are part of emotion dysregulation - which for me is one of the hardest symptoms of bpd to manage. 

The best way I've learned to manage it is that I tend to have physical symptoms I notice before I lose total control (heartbeat in ears, stiff neck, etc). When I have those symptoms, I tell my loved ones that ""the switch has flipped and I need to take space"" then I go for a walk or I go to my room and journal or something until my body feels calm again. I have to do that less and less now, but I definitely still do it sometimes.

This symptom doesn't mean you're not empathic or kind. People with bpd have structural differences in the brain that make it harder for them to regulate emotions. It is going to take some time to figure out what works for you. In the meantime, maybe you can apologize and also explain to people you care about - ""I'm doing my best but I know this is something I need to improve."""

Think about what emotional and physical labor you are taking on to care for her and start dropping the rope a bit (you mentioned you hate cooking but you took that on for her sake - maybe drop that or drop it 3 nights a week or something).

If she reacts with anger or resentment when she notices you setting boundaries, that's not a good sign. She may not be able to maintain a healthy, caring relationship right now.

Is she open to couples counseling?"
actuallesbians,ffgwu5u,t3_ethfqy,1579917089.0,"Wow. For years, I had this experience. People kept trying to convince me to ""spoil"" myself by having my hair done or getting manicures and it was so stressful for me. And then, when I finally came out, I realized that being in this over the top femme space that most salons were was really uncomfortable for me. Being expected to make small talk with people I didn't feel like I could relate to was stressful.

I'm in the process of trying to find a more gender neutral place to get my hair cut / colored but in the meantime, I've gotten pretty good at cutting and dying my own hair. 

I'm honestly kind of relieved that I'm not the only one that had that kind of anxiety about those spaces. But I'm sorry you feel like a freak. You're not."

We married before she began transitioning and while I never considered myself transphobic before I've had to confront a lot of my own internalized transphobia. I'm a work in progress - I've had to seriously reconsider my language, what daily social structures are problematic, etc. 

But even when I'm fucking clueless, I don't think of her as a ""lesser"" woman. She's sweet and beautiful and soft and also a really fun top in all the ways every cis woman I've ever liked has been."

As I've been working through that, I have been trying to love myself and show kindness to myself in the way I always wanted."
BPD,fen5vw0,t3_eq1mfd,1579277661.0,"It's funny, I think, because a lot of people don't examine their own behavior when they're the victim of an abusive cluster B person. I grew up with a really withdrawn and unavailable mom who was and still is abused by her narcissistic mom. She never examined her own behavior and when I call her on behavior that has hurt me, she immediately defaults to victim mode, taking no responsibility for her actions, their affect on others and then seeking sympathy from the person she's hurt.

Everyone I've known with bpd is a victim of some kind of abuse and it's no wonder they've picked up crappy coping skills. Railing against everyone in a group is just discrimination.

It's much easier for other people to believe folks with bpd are just born to abuse and manipulate and they're just a victim of that abuse - it means that don't ever have to examine what fucked up behavior they might be engaging in too (or why they've been drawn to codependent relationships or what they personally got out of that relationship).

That was too long a rant. I agree it's nuts."
BPD,fen3zsw,t1_femrjs9,1579276465.0,I use daylio - I paid for premium which I think was $10 but I really like how much I can personalize tracking. You can add different moods to track (and assign them to a scale) as well as different behaviors. I've added all kinds of dbt skills to behaviors so it helps me track what I'm using from workbooks and therapy too. It will also show you which behaviors are correlated with which moods. I haven't used a lot of mood apps before so I may not be the best person to ask but daylio works for me.
BPD,fel64mb,t3_eppycu,1579214873.0,"The only bpd-specific books I've read have been workbooks. I've got dialectical behavioral therapy skills workbook by McKay, Wood and Brantley and a skills workbook from Marsha Linehan.

Otherwise, I tend to pick books based on issues I'm having in my relationships, my past abuse or behaviors I want to change.

Last year, the best two I read were probably Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents by Lindsay C Gibson and Codependent No More by Melody Beattie. I was able to check both out for free from my library, thankfully."
BPD,fel468p,t3_epnnda,1579213677.0,"I have had similar meltdowns in the kitchen. Depending on my mood, sometimes I can accept advice and sometimes not. I've started to just say to people, ""that's really sweet but I'd like to do this on my own"" when I'm not feeling like I can accept advice.

I'll bet this would be harder for me with roommates then with my wife or good friends, but if she's asking you, she should be willing to accept ""no thanks"" from you, too."
BPD,fel1siz,t3_epl6pk,1579212203.0,"Lots of good comments already. I also binge eat and I've really had success this past year of working through it. I started talking to my counselor and my physicians about it openly instead of trying to hide it, I started tracking when I did it in a mood app, and I started really paying attention to how I felt or what happened right before I did it. I really worked to stop feeling guilty when I did it and ask myself what I could learn from it instead. 

I found that I was coping with a lot of loneliness and distance from my partner, and so I have been working through different ideas of things to do instead. I journal, I clean, I get a cup of herbal tea and watch new tv shows, I read a book or I reach out to a friend. I know some people go for walks, or drives just to get out of the space where they usually binge. 

And seriously, give yourself a pat on the back. You've worked hard to be healthy and you've recognized this isn't healthy and are asking for help. That is all proof of how smart and strong you are."

I would say, there are gender workbooks out there, it may help illuminate for your partner whether the experiences they're having are similar to the experiences other transgender people experience or not.  I read You and Your Gender Identity by Dara Hoffman-Fox and realized I really didn't relate to the transgender experience. Could be a valuable read for your partner."
latebloomerlesbians,fdnn85l,t3_em3h0o,1578589307.0,"I don't know how much research your wife did prior to your transition. In the course of my research when my wife told me she was a transgender woman, I found a not insignificant number of folks whose sexuality changed. It was one of my biggest fears for my relationship and one I bought up. I think you've done well to be honest with your wife throughout the changes you've been going through. This change will be pretty difficult for her (I'm sure it is for you, too) but honesty is important.

I don't know your wife, but think about how she reacts to difficult news and try to give her space and time to process this news. If she has supportive friends / family / counselor etc, encourage her to take the time to talk with them, too. And think about what you want your relationship to look like in the future, too - do you see yourself still married but in an open relationship? Do you want to end the marriage? Those are good questions to consider before you talk with her, too."

So this year I finally went super short and I loved it and even though I have a round face and I freaked out that I would look gross, it actually emphasizes my dimples and cheekbones and I like the way I look. The people who told me not to cut it told me that they liked it and commented on how it suited me. 

I did do some searching for pictures of women with my face shape beforehand to try to find a short style I thought would suit me (there's a surprising amount of different short styles!) And I sent a picture to the hair stylist and she matched it perfectly (which was awesome).

When you're feeling ready: do it for yourself. It's just hair, you can grow it back out if you hate it. And you might find that you really like it."
latebloomerlesbians,fcxghgv,t3_ejg0k7,1578062316.0,"My partner and I have talked about divorce and I had similar thoughts to you. I don't have a job outside the home, I know that when I find one the housing I can afford would not be as safe for our child, I know emotionally that those changes would make it harder for me to manage my emotions. I love our child and want what's best for them, but I also had a child partly because of external pressures and it was incredibly challenging for me emotionally and I would hate for an innocent child to sense any resentment from me.

I don't think you should have to explain anything beyond working this out with your spouse. If anyone asks, ""this is what was best for our children"" is a perfect answer and if I were you I wouldn't say anything more unless I knew the person would be understanding. You are putting your kids first here, even if that's hard for other people to see."
