I know you said you're worried about it blowing up in your face but if you file an ""anonymous"" complaint with your landlord and highlight that you've tried to ask her personally several times to not smoke in the apt and that you're looking to get them involved. Plus then if police do get involved, which I kind of doubt they will given everything, you have on file that you tried to do something about it.

And on another note, moratoriums on evictions will probably not apply if she's breaking the landlord's rules i.e. smoking indoors (which is illegal I think in most states?), but prob something to look into"

Is it possible to do it in person? maybe to call or text him to meet up once everything calms down and people are allowed outside? I feel like you both said you felt a pull and meeting in person will confirm that again better for both of you, more so than a phone call.

Having sex with someone while they're asleep is a big deal.
