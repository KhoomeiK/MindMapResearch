All this time, I had never listened to any of the seasons. So I'm getting into it in a weird order but I'm thoroughly enjoying it anyway! I'm nearing the end of season one and it has been wholesome and lovely."
Runner5,flbn48f,t3_fmyv06,1585008135.0,I finished season eight recently and it was really bittersweet. I'm so proud of myself for sticking through it for so long but now I'm sad because there's no season 9 yet! Thankfully I still have most of the other adventures to work on. And I wouldn't even mind starting from the beginning again. It has been a crazy journey!
