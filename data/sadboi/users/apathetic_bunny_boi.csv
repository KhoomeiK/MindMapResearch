Her and her companion were attacked by an assassin in their home town so they had to flee. They climbed into the back of a merchant's trailer and long story short, the ""merchants"" were a pair of gods - God of trade, and god of death - and she became the latter's disciple, before gradually learning his magic.

Eventually the group fought the Big Baddie, where God of Death was slain, and his magic abilities, knowledge, and godly responsibilities moved onto Nü."

One of the main symptoms is a lack of impulse control, so that post was correct with that whole thing, and hurting people can happen if you let your impulses guide you. But once you're aware of your illness and in treatment, you should be working on your impulse control.
