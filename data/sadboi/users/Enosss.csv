schizophrenia,fphok54,t3_gdezqr,1588624937.0,"Risperidone worked for me but for some reason I stopped taking it without consent of my doctor so I became psychotic again.

Right now I am taking a depot injection of paliperidone which, apart from weight gain, has no side effects and keeps my illness contained. This med basically is risperidone so yeah, I can recommend it."
schizophrenia,fphnl4k,t3_gdhgn9,1588624442.0,"I've had several episodes and there has always been a severe lack of motivation or even depression after each one.

The motivation will come back slow but steady. For now do everything you can, as in take your meds, do small tasks, etc. It might seem unbearable for the moment but hang in there. It will pass"

schizophrenia,f1ntk91,t3_da204f,1569625952.0,"You in the right. He should have his psychosis calm down before he goes to an addiction center. Been there, done all that and the most important thing is being ""sober"" since you can not argue with a psychotic person.

In my case I went into addiction therapy after I got treated for my psychosis and I am now 3,5 years clean of weed."

Do these hallucinations still happen to you, even though you're on your meds? Because since I take my medication I am free of it."

Often times people with said sickness offend or harass others and even police officers. I did too but luckly no one beat me to death. It's easily treatable with the right medication (or at least it was in my case)"
