depression,f6v6i2b,t3_dt2k3z,1573177909.0,"Yeah, whenever I read this piece of advice I just want to say fuck off. I've been open about my issues with some people and guess what. People just leave me or say they feel like a therapist which they communicate way too late until it's at the point of resentment (I always ask people to please be direct and that I don't want to bother in any way), leaving me even worse off. I then feel worthless and wonder why it is that others supposedly have a support system, and what's wrong with me."

Someone's who's depressed doesn't need to risk being hurt by anyone here potentially offering to talk to them but not following through on it, then maybe feeling even more like no one cares. Besides, perhaps others could use the advice that would otherwise be given in PM's."
