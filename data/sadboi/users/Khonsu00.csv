God made us as we are, don't let anyone tell you otherwise, he made me bisexual and I'm incredibly proud, not all the time but I try to be. It's never too early to learn this stuff, and you also have to learn that some people want you to be like them, they don't truly want you to thrive, so don't listen to anyone who tells you that it's wrong to be who you are. I'm here to talk whenever you need."

bisexual,fq56vg6,t3_ggcv2e,1589094467.0,"Jesus fucking Christ (yes I see the irony there). The whole point of Christianity is to love God by loving the people he made, AS HE MADE THEM. This is terrible parenting by athiest standards and Christian standards. Since I came out I tried to live as a bisexual and a person who actually loves people in an informed and kind way that actually expresses love, but that conflicted with conservative Christian views I was brought up (my parents didn't raise me conservative but they avoided politics for the most part and I just developed conservative within my private schooled, priveleged life). In high school I began to question capitalism and in 12th grade I came out to myself, my friends, and my family as bi. I tried to continue attending Baptist organizations that my extended family participate in, but my inner conflict and general anxiety disorder led to vomiting and just in general feeling like shit. I started researching by myself and found many leftist and LGBTQ+ accepting Christian ideologies. I vowed to never try and push my Faith onto anybody else, everyone's journey is different. Now I'm a non-denominational Christian and an anarchist, and I just want everyone to know that God created them to be unique and amazing in their own ways. I understand why a lot of people aren't Christians but I want to spread love and the best way I know how to do that is through music and knowledge. So if you're struggling with religion as a queerio like me then check out r/GayChristians and a few others I can't seem to find I thought there was one for religion in general called r/gayfaith but apparently not. I'm here if anyone needs to talk, there's very little chance I won't be able to respond quickly unless I'm asleep. Much love, you are all so beautiful as you are."

Terfs, swerfs, and other radfems are just like incels in the ways they think and speak, very very misguided people.
