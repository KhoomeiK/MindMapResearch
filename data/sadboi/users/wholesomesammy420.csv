Im still figuring out my episodes, what triggers them and what signs to look for, but ill take a dab of potent diamonds and it spiraled me out into one of the worst meltdowns i have ever had. But there are so many other times it helps me out. I habe noticed when i am sober (for a few weeks after titrating) i am more irritable, less go with the flow, but i feel like i have more control. When i smoke, it helps me be a nicer person to my loved ones. It is a risk either way, but it really depends on the person. So interesting."

I have been practicing for months, and im just now finally able to get into the right mindset for me to keep my mind and body from going into overdrive. At first i thought it was just another trend like going for a hike will cure ur depression! But after doing my research, and becoming sick and tired of feeling like shit... i gave it a real try. Its not about curing how you feel, its about giving your brain a break from the ping pong of thoughts. It gets you away from living inthe future or the past, and just enjoying the present. It sounds like you already have some engraved feelings about it, and for it to work, you might have to work through that first. 

Mindfulness isnt for everyone, but it helps a lot of people. I hope one day it works for you, its a great coping mechanism when you are away from home and need some grounding."

When my sibling gets a cold, they cannot cough because they no longer have the muscles to cough... that means we are off to the ER where they have the necessary equipment. (But also the worst place for them to be in a time like this)

Also - if me or my mom get this virus... who is going to take care of my sibling? This is fatal for them for so many reasons. No caregivers, and no safe place to go if they get sick.

All i can remember was feeling the change, if youre used to the highs and lows its hard to get used to not feeling as intensely so it feels like youre numbing but in reality youre probably stabilizing. It takes a lot of educating yourself, i bought the bipolar survival guided and its helped me not feel so confused. The book lists a lot of the meds that are prescribed with details on side effects and what they aim to do for you. I hope this was helpful! Im no expert, but im big on investigating and learning from trial and error and finding/sharing resources! Feel free to pm me if you ever need to talk, the beginning can be overwhelming."

CannabisExtracts,fh9zqfj,t1_fh91ct5,1581393451.0,"I'm sorry but I think that is incorrect. The THCa needs to be decarbed if you are trying to get high from this oil. THCa turns into THC when it is heated. THC does NOT turn into CBN once it is heated, it turns into CBN as it ages. You can still ingest this as is, some of the THCa will be decarbed by stomach acid when you are digesting. 

Instead of depending on our spotty knowledge, check out projectcbd.org. They have great resources and articles with studies to back them up.
