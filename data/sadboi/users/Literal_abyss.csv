But find one aspect about your self that you like. Some people will be negative and say there isn't anything to like about themselves but that's just dumb. For example I like my shoulders because they have never done me wrong. it might sound silly but just find one part maybe a freckle, eyes, ankle and it helps"

Now what should we have? you ask, well today you want to guzzle down a buttery slice of toast. You head to the bread bin and find the packet of bread almost empty the unwanted slices hanging limply at the bottom. You sigh.... but wait. Another fresh packet of bread is sitting there in all its glory waiting to be opened. carefully opening the new loaf and finding the best pieces for your breakfast banquet. After you finish toasting them and then slather them in butter you turn back to the new loaf and cover your tracks. Making quick work you give it a twist and put the zip tie back in place making it look like a fresh loaf. With the feeling of success you savoir every bite of that toast while knowing the next person with get the nearly mouldy bread."

I missed almost a year of school and have GCSEs in 2020. So obviously I'm very far behind. I'm not trying to blame it on anyone but I wish that Psychiatrists and therapists realise that missing school is just going to make peoples mental health spiral in the future, For many reasons."
