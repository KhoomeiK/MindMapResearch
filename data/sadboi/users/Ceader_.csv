RATS,flauyfw,t1_flaukb8,1584991643.0,Maybe talk to your vet about neutering them? That is the only thing i can think of that might be causing the aggression
RATS,flauf5x,t3_fnpuqu,1584991338.0,I have a rat that bites me too and his is a hormonal issue and he’s about 2  1/2 years old so I can’t get him neutered but I still love him even if I can’t hold him. But From what you said I think it might be hormonal to and how old are they?

Also I don’t have the money to get him fixed if I wanted to. About the fight I woke up one morning and found blood everywhere and micky terrified in the corner that’s when I separated them I really wish I could have heard it and stopped it.
