What you can do, is recruit her in one of the take all seventeen kingdoms episodes, preferably near the end since she should have a strong link then with whoever she has. Level up the farm in Aurora and you can get wild Igglybuff. It evolves at link 50%, then get a Moon Stone and evolve. Alternatively you could just Guardian Charm if she already has Wigglytuff, if you set her up to guard a kingdom by herself that is especially good for link if the enemy attacks, only issue is Wigglytuff isn't too good."
