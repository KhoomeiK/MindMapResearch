FML,fl7yow0,t1_fl7hzmp,1584912207.0,"do you remember what your lease says? i lived in a very scummy complex some months ago. we had to be evicted because their rent went up almost 200+ and we could barely keep up with the bills. in the lease it said that if we have to move or are evicted, that they would keep everything in some sort of storage unit, and that we are allowed to come back at a certain time to get everything (in a new state now so that was never an option), but the place was lead by idiots and full blown liars. they said over the phone that they would literally just throw it in the trash, and yet, their lease clearly states it would be stored away. if you still have the lease and it has something similar to what mine had, i'd take that up a notch and get some sort of professional help/advice on the matter.. especially if your grades depend on your belongings, and to lose electronics would drive me mad. best of luck to you"
