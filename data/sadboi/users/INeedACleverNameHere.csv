farming,fpjhvk6,t3_gdho6j,1588669090.0,"Poultry farmers for the most part, do not own the birds that they raise. They are contracted by a company (Tyson, Olymel) to raise the birds. So the farmer will own the land, build the barns and infrastructure and the producing company will have a contract something like they will give you 20,000 chicks to raise and will be back in 6 or 8 weeks to pick up the birds for processing and give you $X. 

The farmers do not own the birds in any way. They are providing the service of raising the birds. If processing plants are shut down and a company has farmers waiting with 20,000 birds a day, it is costing the whole system money. A farmer absolutely 100% cannot go to his neighbors and say ""Hey, want to buy some cheap chickens?"" Because that is 1) Theft and 2) Will probably never have another contract with the producer again which means his barns and everything he has invested will go to waste.
