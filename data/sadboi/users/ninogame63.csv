KindVoice,fqriz41,t3_gkekiw,1589585302.0,"Love yourself before others can love you. Be confident, workout. Do things you like, pursue your passion. Others will be interested in being with you the more you are happy with yourself. I speak from experience, I always get rejected and I just gave up on love. Start just having fun and focus on myself. I was really confident and happy. Then when I was confident enough to start talking to a girl that likes me for who I am not my body. At then you‚Äôll find true love. Don‚Äôt struggle with girls you got rejected with, stay true to yourself and be happy by just being you first before you be with anybody. Relationship is good but if you go in a relationship without thinking that will cost a lot, your mental health and time will be wasted. Patience and confident is what you need right now. Body is just a tool for great things. Love your body and love who you are. That‚Äôs all, thanks"
