Either keep friendship or take risk to confess. There won't be any friendship between us because I feel jealous and pain, probably he has some negative feelings as well. 

Actually the blocking thing is hurt at first, but now I understand I really need to move on to find another person. Maybe many years past, I will appreciate what I learned from experience."
