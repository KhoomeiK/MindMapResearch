However your ways of punishment yanking them around, calling them names are pathetic and not at all constructive. Who tf tells their kids he is a little bastard? You use that language with kids they will it back one day. Abuse is not only physical its also mental and verbal. Humiliation, swear words at a six year old, are definitely abuse. You need to teach them through consequences not with fear. Of course teaching them is more difficult then scaring them so people like you just don't want to put in the effort and work to be a decent adult."

JusticeServed,folbci3,t1_fokqdpc,1587858635.0,"""Grab his chair"", ""yank him around"", ""tell him he is a little bastard"", ""embaress him in front of the family"". How does this sound like a logical way? It sounds like a abusive way to handle a situation especially with a six year old. It is common for children to throw tantarums and get jealous of siblings. I am sure you will agree that we all wanted presents on our siblings birthday, some of us got them some got reprimanded. That's what I will do reprimand my kid at the spot, if they don't behave give them corner time, if still not take away their ipad or video games. No responsible parents go around yanking their kid or calling him a bastard. Also you never embaress kids infront of other people maybe immediate family but never outsiders because it shatters the kids confidence."

Recently I found myself trying too hard to fit in with some people and I felt like what you described.

AmItheAsshole,ezr879f,t3_d1r1vr,1568070107.0,"NTA. It's a difficult situation, your son feels like you spent more time/love on his siblings and that is probably true. Given that he wasn't living with you.  Its not only your job to make things easier for him. Why did your ex-wife move to another state if learning the skill was so imp for ur son? Maybe she had genuine reasons like career building, but so do you. The reason why your son is bringing up all this emotional stuff up now is because he is in a bad place right now and wants to blame someone. I am not saying he is consciously doing it but he is emotionally blackmailing you. Involving your son in the company in anyway will cause a shitstorm. 33% is a huge stake, imagine if he tries to destroy the company later in jealousy of his siblings then what? Clearly the twins and the son are not getting along, now if you place them in the same workplace with so many negative emotions the company will eventually be finished. The son will try to stake his claim, the twins will wanna do things their way. It will create more spite between both parties. Tell him to be a grownup and get a better job. If he agrees maybe you can help him financially until he find a better job, or maybe u can help him pay to take clasess for this skill if he cares about it so much.
