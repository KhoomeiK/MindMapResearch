AskHR,fgssdfw,t3_f05g19,1581091644.0,"You probably should mention it since it is so important to you.  You will most likely burn bridges but if these are not connections you want or need in the future, definitely say something.  No one should just grab and hug you, most people extend their arms and expect to be met halfway to complete the hug.  Personally, if I ever offered a hug to a colleague and was rejected or  ‚Äúleft hanging‚Äù with empty open arms, I would be extremely hurt. I would cease any interaction with that person outside of meetings etc.  If you have a phobia of germs or being touched or some such, I would explain it that way.  If you just do not like human contact or make any sexual connotation from a hug, I would not advise disclosing that.  It makes you seem cold or just outright weird to get sexual feelings from a hug. People understand mental issues like phobias more so than just saying I reject your offer of affection."
