dividend_investing,ff3eqcw,t1_ff38421,1579539569.0,"I used simply safe dividends service for free for 14 days. I took a screenshot of all the stocks they recommended. It’s a website that is made for people nearing retirement and it helped me get a dividend portfolio together.  Right now I’m at $12 a year. It’s not much, but I look at it as $12 for doing absolutely nothing."
dividend_investing,ff37fcc,t3_ere0uw,1579535478.0,"This is me. I started last year and now have around $950. I’m up 12%. I don’t have Tesla, Apple, or really a lot of stocks over $100 cause Robinhood doesn’t do fractional shares.  I just can’t afford to buy more than $100 at a time. I don’t have more than 20 shares of any stocks.  Most I just have 1-2. So just try to do your research and just buy what you can. Actually the stock for me that has grown the most is SnapChat.  I bought like 5 shares when it was cheap and now it’s doing much better."

science,f9numrr,t3_e61p2u,1575490942.0,"I have to correct a few Misconceptions. African American hair shafts are the usually the thinnest. African American hair density is usually the thinnest. Coarse refers to the thickness of the hair shaft. Therefore, African American hair is usually not the coarsest.
