SuicideWatch,etf10z2,t3_c34ko8,1562756103.0,"Please take care of yourself. It is really sad and unfortunate and burdening for you but  if it means anything, you're not responsible. I have felt the same way as your girlfriend for a long time and I think or have thought about taking my life many many times when I was rejected or left behind. I am still alive and if I died it wouldn't be anyone's fault. It is not easy to live with a depressed person, and I say this as one myself."

NPD,eofw9pv,t1_elyyc2f,1558545019.0,"I cannot agree more. I think my ex-husband has NPD and I know that while I have suffered a tremendous amount because of his behaviours and believes, I don't for think any of it was ""intentional"" in an evil or sadistic way. When I started therapy and started to recognize that I was manipulated, controlled, gaslighted and tried to leave, he became from an angry abusive person to a helpless confused child who just didn't understand what was happening and why was he being punished. With him, despite a lot of effort the self awareness or even teaching him to see his behaviour, begging him to go to therapy, nothing worked. 

All throughout the separation he suffered and continues to suffer by refusing to divorce. He is genuinely in tears and thinks that if he is so unhappy and sad without me, why am I still leaving him? It is like he just can't see me or my life for anything beyond his own feelings. 

How much ever I care for him, giving him what he wants is like giving an alcoholic a drink. In all of his pleas, concern for my suffering or well-being or what I want is still absent. I pray everyday that he can become aware of whatever has caused him to be this way, its effect on his life. I wish him growth and I wish everyday that he is in less pain."

If you have some time to invest, tell her to draw/paint without worrying about selling, taxes part. Take care of setting that profile up for her and once she starts to make any income, even a small one the validation would probably kick in a sense of ownership in her. 

Another way to contribute could be to participate in studies online, crowd-sourcing like on Mechanical Turk. Don't be too pushy though, if she is happy being a homemaker and creative, stay supportive."
relationship_advice,eoatov8,t1_eo9zaja,1558427630.0,"I agree completely, have been through this mindset and would recognize it anywhere. Higher level of tolerance for abuse and making excuses for abuser, not registering abuse. You are a survivor and you need help of therapy and better understanding of abuse to heal and to get yourself back."
relationship_advice,eoasync,t1_eoaciyn,1558427026.0,"Absolutely 100 percent this. Abusers may not be doing it with full awareness even. But it is neither your responsibility to figure it out or fix it. You may genuinely feel that he loves you and cares about you many times. Control and possessiveness can be intoxicating, especially if you had troubled childhood, self-esteem issues, unmet need for protective love and care. A part of you is recognizing that something is wrong. Listen to that part. Trust me, this is only going to get worse. 

You are young. You have a big life ahead of you. It may not feel like that but we are all way more stronger than we think. It will be difficult to break out of only secure relationship you have around but it will be worth it in the end. I am from another part of the world and wish I could help you more with tangible channels of support. But at least I am here for you in words like many others here. Stay strong."
Divorce,eoapvv1,t1_eo9yi3e,1558424497.0,"I am 31F, had a very difficult separation and honestly I am glad that I didn't have a kid. You and your ex seem to be really kind people. An amicable separation would save you so much hurt and pain and would really make healing faster. I also badly want children but after a very difficult marriage not sure about marrying again but I often think about adopting at some point or fostering. May be that is something that can give you hope? 

Also my cousin got pregnant at 36, natural pregnancy, my aunty gave birth at 41, so please don't lose hope. You have plenty of time. I can relate to the anxiety but the way I sometimes deal with it is by preparing for the worst and making a plan for how I may still make my life work around that. 

Wish you the best with your move and hopefully this will be a time for you to make your independent world and circle of friends. With move part settled, a lot of the anxiety would be eased, I believe. 

Love and support to you."
relationship_advice,eoag5ng,t1_eo928tv,1558416728.0,"I would also agree that there might be depression underlying this change. A lot of times this is a vicious cycle too. She certainly is in distress about possibility of the marriage breaking apart and seems like also that has body image issues due to suddenly being fat. Even if she didn't have depression, these changes would cause shame, fear, confusion, and other negative emotions that are hard to navigate alone. I would strongly recommend therapy. If you are unhappy in the marriage and want out it is your choice certainly. But if you love her like a friend or family even, get her to see that she can get help."

Seattle,eoaen3e,t1_eo92hpg,1558414904.0,"Thank you both for the heads-up. I thought about it, but for now the move seems a healthier alternative to continue where I am. Weather is a concern, let's see how it goes. I will probably move by end of June. When does the gloomy weather start? It will take me a bit to make friends, find a new therapist, figure out the medical system and so on. I kind of love rain but cold weather would be new for me. I don't like the heavy downpour that lasts for days and everything afterwards have mildew smell. Don't think seattle has that kind of rain. Does it?"
