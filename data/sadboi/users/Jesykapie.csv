todayilearned,evhlzki,t3_cjxpt3,1564528494.0,I donâ€™t have this disorder but I did have insomnia that eventually got so bad I stopped sleeping. I started hallucinating and my specialist told me my brain was dying and that I would die without sleep. I kept seeing a foreboding tall shadowy figure out of the corner of my eye. I also saw a foreboding shadowy beast (dog?). Good sleep hygiene and reliable sleep meds keep me well rested these days.   Good riddance sleepless summer of 2013.

Fibromyalgia,evf86mh,t1_eve7suo,1564490876.0,"It took me a while to find a good therapist. I was so discouraged because I met rude therapists and dismissive therapists, or ones I didnâ€™t vibe with. Remember that itâ€™s your choice, you donâ€™t have to stick with any doctor. 
I did research on trauma informed therapists because my pain is rooted in trauma. You can definitely personalize your search based on your needs. 
Another thing that was really tough was trying so many different meds. Some of the side effects can be frightening. I really leaned heavily on the nurse hotline and the suicide prevention hotline to help me understand and handle the different challenges. I also called my docs to keep them informed about what was going on and I asked lots of questions so that they could guide me through things. 

When you get back to Uni the school may have confidential resources available. I saw a social worker on campus and she ended up being a terrific support.  I also went to disability services through school to get accommodations for test taking and they also informed my profs about my disabilities and how they may affect me during class. 

Keep your chin up! People like you and I are freaking warriors! Fibro fierce ðŸ˜‹!"
Fibromyalgia,eve4ipk,t3_cjjgu6,1564455346.0,"Iâ€™m sorry you arenâ€™t feeling support from your family and that you are feeling depressed. What you are going through isnâ€™t easy. You sound like you are all ready doing so many great things that are going to help you on this journey. 
My mom isnâ€™t a good support either. I stopped looking to her for that type of support. I hate it but it helps.
I have found therapy to be a useful in developing coping strategies. My therapist and I come up with different things for me to try and we devise plans to cope with specific stressors. 
I used to think that some of the things that different specialists wanted me to try sounded silly. Take deep breathing for example. I felt like my world was ending when I first became ill, I had never felt pain, despair, or raw panic on such an intense level, and these specialists wanted me to take deep breaths?! 
It didnâ€™t make sense to me at the time and I resisted trying. Eventually I was desperate enough to try!
Now I regularly use belly-breathing, box breathing, and a method where the exhale is 2x longer than the inhale. 
Keep looking for different coping tools to add to your arsenal, you can never have enough :). 
Recently my therapist had me play with a Tupperware filled with dried peas and lentils while I recalled an upsetting event. I was surprised by how soothing it was! I definitely see myself using some version of tactile distraction in the future. 
Some of the other things that help me: an emergency playlist of familiar, soothing music in case I need to wind down, practicing tons of self care, I use ice packs to make really painful spots go numb, and I NEVER rush! 

I hope you are able to find many things that help you!"
