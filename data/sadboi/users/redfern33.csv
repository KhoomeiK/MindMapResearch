Graymuzzles,fkhr1r5,t3_fiddpy,1584204368.0,"So cal here, I‚Äôm a regional manager for an online grocery ordering company. It. Has. Been. Insane. People have lost their damn minds. No thought, just hysterical reaction. I hate to think what would happen in a real real immediate crises. Almost everyone has lost any sight of helping their fellow man and it‚Äôs all for themselves. It‚Äôs quite disgusting. Most people I would know fortunately have enough food just sitting in their house probably to get through this. It‚Äôs very frustrating to see people in their mid thirties who are healthy taking supplies from people who would need it more. Otherwise the stress energy in the world is becoming quite powerful and it sucks. I am ready for people to just calm down and realize we‚Äôre all in it together."
