abusiverelationships,fp8738n,t1_fp86s7j,1588385186.0,Thank you! I will go no contact. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re safe. Thank you for your storyðŸ’—
abusiverelationships,fp864aw,t1_fp7z65e,1588384493.0,Part of me wants to block him but part of me wants to not because I want him to come back. Itâ€™s all Iâ€™ve known for 4 years. How do I find the courage to leave him in the past and move on?
abusiverelationships,fp85ypr,t1_fp7thte,1588384380.0,Yea I said lmao because part of me knew he wasnâ€™t gonna come. He always says no but I get that. I can be insecure a lot.
abusiverelationships,fp7s8it,t1_fp7rrui,1588376718.0,I havenâ€™t seen him in a month because he moved out from our shared home and he hasnâ€™t texted or called or anything. I was just in the hospital for a week and wanted to see if he wanted to hangout. He was still my bf at the time. But I get that lmao okay was wrong and thatâ€™s why I said sorry.

summonerschool,fkn1o6i,t3_fj55da,1584349342.0,I used to be exactly like this. For months I would only play against bots. I would try to play a pvp game ones a week until I started getting comfortable. I also started to realize that even if people think I suck youâ€™ll likely never see them again. Hope this helps!
depression,fkn104h,t3_fjh85q,1584348461.0,Also I looked up the address and name and there are people with the last name friedenbach living there so I really hope this isnâ€™t real. Please please do not take your family with you
depression,fkn0ota,t3_fjh85q,1584348049.0,Man you can do whatever to yourself but donâ€™t bring your family into this.
depression,fkn0lmi,t3_fjhh3i,1584347934.0,Same then staying at home all the time and just doing nothing wouldnâ€™t seem so lazy.
relationship_advice,fjcvt6f,t3_fb87fr,1583238463.0,Update. Heâ€™s been ignoring me for three days. He makes me wash all of the dishes even the ones he made because itâ€™s my punishment. He also hasnâ€™t been hugging or kissing me and every time I try to get one he tells me I canâ€™t have one because Iâ€™m being punished. Iâ€™ve been crying every day and he gives zero shits. He said I canâ€™t keep getting away with being jealous. I told him him that itâ€™s been three days already and he said so what itâ€™s been three years of this and Iâ€™m over it.
AskReddit,fhe0qmk,t3_f2goj1,1581510055.0,"When I was a freshman a friend of mine, who was also a freshman, sucked a friends dick in class on a couch when the teacher was gone and other people filmed it. The video got spread and most of our phones got taken away. My friend and the boy had to go to teen court and could never be in the same class ever again."

depression,ffq6h7y,t1_ffq6dx4,1580123089.0,My favorite amine right now is Kakegurui. Itâ€™s not that long so thereâ€™s not much commitment. I havenâ€™t watched jojo or the others but also one punch name is great too :)
depression,ffq5y3o,t1_ffq5xij,1580122287.0,Okay!!!

depression,ffq4r7d,t3_eulb1f,1580120422.0,Same. I havenâ€™t talked to anyone since the 18 of January. I donâ€™t know who to talk to either and things are getting worse.
depression,ffq4382,t1_fe4ctbd,1580119349.0,This is exactly how I feel and Iâ€™m so glad I read this. You described what I couldnâ€™t for years.
AdventuresOfSabrina,ffh6crx,t1_ffh5lat,1579924349.0,RIGHT!!
AdventuresOfSabrina,ffgzbfw,t1_ffgyzqc,1579918940.0,Maybe he does love her but definitely not as much as he loves Sabrina. I feel like he tried to bury his death really hard and is going over the top to convince Roz and himself that he loves her. But I see your point.
