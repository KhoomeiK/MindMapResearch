Testing could well open the doors to lots of support. My diagnosis meant I was allowed to type my notes in lessons and also my GCSES and A Levels. I was given rest breaks and extra time in my exams, including university exams, and entitled me to financial help from the government to buy software etc to help me through uni.

Hope some of this helps!"
harrypotter,fnky96l,t3_g2b1rn,1587042963.0,What's the 'calmly' thing? I'm a relatively new fan.
insanepeoplefacebook,fnkxqmw,t3_g2cx1w,1587042612.0,Eh. Its all about online Scrabble.
TrollXChromosomes,fnkxlut,t3_g2c0be,1587042520.0,Ugh. That's awful. I'm so sorry.

AskReddit,fngsrnk,t1_fngm91t,1586943592.0,"This. I'm in my twenties and have mild cerebral palsy. Mild, because I can talk and eat and walk. But I get very tired very quickly (as in, I have to sit and rest every couple of minutes) and I'm quite uncoordinated. I take a priority seat on public transport because it would take me too long to get to a normal seat and if the bus starts moving before I sit down I will fall over and so often I get glared at or people talk very loudly to each other about 'young people having no respect or care for others). Ugh!"
AskReddit,fngrgig,t1_fng9or6,1586942204.0,"Yep, I had this too. I did all the things you're not supposed to ie went out drinking in a short skirt, then went back with a group of guys to watch a film in one of their rooms. The fact that we were all flatmates and friends and so I felt safe with them didn't come up. Definitely all my fault."
harrypotter,fnetdlf,t3_g16t05,1586895512.0,Thanks everyone!
AskReddit,fnd4q1u,t1_fnd4ge2,1586858677.0,This is good to hear! Glad you're looking after yourself as well as your daughter and I hope you both continue to thrive!
AskReddit,fnd41on,t1_fnchgqy,1586857910.0,I'm so sorry. That must have been really hard.
