Electricity,f1bvwwv,t1_f1972m2,1569344158.0,"The electrician was from an apartment service for which I pay for monthly so he didn't charge anything. 

After a lot of worry I finally plugged in my charger again and it works perfectly. No ticking or anything, it's not causing any issues with other electronics either. This event probably decreased its lifespan, but I'm not too bothered as long as it works now. It would fail eventually anyway.

The owner seems like a nice guy, this place just hasn't been used in a while. I'll ask him to get it done.

Anyway, I guess all is working fine now. Thank you again for reassuring me about the charger and for helping me wrap my head around this problem."
Electricity,f194qbf,t1_f18zvzw,1569267804.0,"Yeah I did see it myself and it was like properly scorched. He cut of the top part and just connected it up, though it looks clean now. I'm just renting for college and I've informed the owner. He'll handle it apparently. I don't know what caused the burnt wire. The electrician said it was just old and ""went through a lot"". I do live in europe but not in an EU country so regulations here are... Meh.

I'll try out the charger tomorrow and hope for the best.

Thank you a lot for the advice and for explaining things to me. If the charger works and no longer causes ticking then this situation is more or less cleaned up... I'll ask the owner to get new wiring part for sure though. This place is rather old after all."
Anxiety,f190zne,t3_d8a607,1569266324.0,"You're not alone. This one time I was at a family gathering and I was absolutely starving but in order to get food I had to stand up. Everyone was sitting down so everyone would look at me if I stood up or at least that's what my mind forced me to think. And so I sat there, motionless for 3 hours, starving and just watching the food on the other table. I didn't talk to anyone, I just wanted to be completely unnoticed to the point where just standing up was too much.

Probably not as stressful as your story, though. I get this feeling often sadly. Wanting to do something, but not doing it because people would notice. Lost a girlfriend this way, too."
Anxiety,f18z8c9,t3_d85862,1569265574.0,"Me on bus rides. I went on a 6 hour bus ride the other day and the only stop had a toilet with only urinals. I don't use those out of anxiety and there were some people in the bathroom. I ended up worrying and thinking about nothing else on that trip. Just ""I gotta pee"" and ""don't think about peeing"". Ugh...

In the end I didn't even really pee right when I arrived...As soon as the option of a toilet appeared I was like ""well no need to worry about that anymore""."

Try to find peace with yourself and your past. Move forward with a vow to become a better person with each new day. Wake up early, make some tea, look at the sky, enjoy the chirping of birds and appreciate life."

Electricity,f18thc4,t1_f18293u,1569263139.0,"Thank you so much for the detailed reply. I was quite worried about the charger not being correct for the laptop but you reassured me about it.  I still don't lnow if it's faulty though.

I called an electrician eventually. Honestly I just wanted to went about my worries a little here, I knew I'd have to call an electrician either way. He found that the master breaker (hopefully the right word here) wire was fried, like really badly burnt. I don't have access to it (didn't really know where it was, it was in the hallway outside) and he fixed it, though he advised me to get new breakers set in place. Although he fixed it I'm still really hesitant to plug in my laptop since I don't have an answer to the ticking yet. 

Could a burnt wire cause such an issue? A ticking of electricity (as in electricity switching between being available and not being available) seems kinda difficult to pinpoint. 

Also the breakers weren't tripping at all. I just didn't know the proper word for the ticking (still not a proper word, but I'll go with that for now, maybe flickering would be better) and I also didn't know what a breaker trip is. Sorry for the confusion. So the real issue was that my access to electricity was rapidly changing (that's what I call ticking) which honestly sounds really dangerous and I'm surprised nothing worse happened. 

I'm just worried that the burnt wire wasn't the cause but rather the effect of the ticking.... If I plug in the laptop now and it ticks again could it fry the wire again? Is there a way to test my charger without putting myself at risk? It worked just fine at my house, but maybe there I had some better protection in place so I didn't notice it being faulty."
personalfinance,ey9919d,t1_ey96olc,1566937942.0,Thank you for reasuring me. It only makes sense for the bank not to put important information on things that people usually throw away but I got a little paranoid I guess.
