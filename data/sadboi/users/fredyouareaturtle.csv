Witty.

I was merely wondering if it was different for a dom relationship than with a traditional hook up. Yes I know that hook ups with big age gaps are often not advised and are seen as inappropriate. But they happen all he time and people don't go to jail or go to pieces over it. Not that fucking big a deal, unless there's something about a dom relationship that makes the situation different."

relationships,fpg9evg,t1_fpg45hk,1588597768.0,Why though? It's not illegal. Are they not entitled to want to hook up with a 22 year old who is into the same things they are?

Continue to ignore him and his messages. Make sure he cant screenshot any of your pictures and just lay low. Do not feel like you need to talk to him about it, ever. You don't.

You're saying he had one of the dirtiest profiles on fetlife - he is probably just as worried about his own privacy as you are. Again, don't talk to him about this or ever mention it, and it'll probably go away.

And, if you ever get the feeling that he is going to bring it up in front of people, deny coolly and try to catch his eye and wink at him. Try to get him to catch the drift like it's a secret between all of you, which it is. That or serenely deny. Unless he has photo proof of that he tries to show people, in which case he is a little shit and you can humiliate him just as badly with his own profile (which you should screenshot and save just in case).

If he does have some kind of ulterior motive to humiliate you (which I doubt he does - he is probably genuinely just into kink) then remember you have age and experience on your side. If you don't act ashamed, then he really has nothing on you."
