BPD,fqlhfuk,t3_gjid03,1589458194.0,"I had a job in 2015 temporarily, and a few small jobs here and there, it hasn't been easy but it's doable for me.

I've been working for about 3 years in December and I have had BPD presumably since trauma around age 6, rearing its head mostly my freshman year of hs 6 years ago. When I first started working (at a dead mall in a shoe store) it was slow but stressful because I have really bad anxiety & I absolutely hate being in public most days, I get anxious feeling like I'm being watched or judged or anything. I was always scared I'd mess up the money or say something wrong to a customer. But I got through it. 

Not long after I had that job they put me (18 at the time, bpd almost at its worst, but I had CBD oil at that point and it HELLA saved me) in charge of an entire pop up store and I ran 12 hour shifts open to close alone for weeks on end, let me tell you I did NOT believe in myself or my abilities at all. I had anxiety attacks, panic attacks, i punched shit, cried in the back, cried in front of customers, etc etc etc. But I got through that too. 

Now I've been at my current job (I work at a popular retail franchise in my hometown) for almost 2 years this June and I've turned it into a positive learning experience. I travel to different stores with my boss and meet new people and im happy to do it. Ive done 12 inventories with them and I've been a manager and done pretty much every single job there is to do at my store. even though my bpd is still relatively severe I think I've got enough control of it that I know i have to make money and put that above my emotions so.. i just kinda do. doesn't mean I don't have days where I feel like im falling apart, but I always end up making up for when that happens and I know that I'm human and its okay to feel these things, its okay to not be okay sometimes. 

I hope you're able to find that clarity, and are able to perform at a job someday without feeling anxiety weighing too heavily on you. I know it can be difficult, in my situation I let the anxiety build up so much that the idea of it was too scary to fathom but now that I'm where I'm at and I've learned what I've learned im beyond glad I let myself go through those trials. It's a lot of testing patience, resolve, problem solving skills, etc, but its more than worth it if you're able to."

I always find it more realistic when instead of just saying, ""it's gonna be okay"" somebody tells me, ""its gonna be okay, I've been through it too."" It's true that in the moment of feeling all of that negativity you can't hear the positive side- it's like drowning and you can hear everybody above water talking but not what they're saying. I hope everyone that's in that mental place finds it in themselves to resurface sooner rather than later.

BPD,eyxydsg,t3_cz5rmd,1567565810.0,"Hi, so I haven't tried those medications before but I thought I'd let you know that your experience will be different from some people because of gene-drug interaction! For some people it may work because their genetics dont interact negatively with the pathway the medication takes, and for others it wouldn't work and could have side effects because of their genetics. 

Genesight is a really cool tool that I personally think everybody who needs (mood stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihypnotics, etc.) medication should utilize, because with a simple swab of your saliva it helps you see what medications your genetics will interact with positively or negatively. 

Hope this helps a little bit!"

BPD,eyatcft,t1_eyaf8lt,1566969483.0,"Of course! I'm very intrigued by how the brain is affected by different disorders and why it makes us feel the way we do. I never figured memory impairment was a causation due to BPD, but I also didnt know how many people had issues with it. With saying that, though, I do full-heartedly believe that it's fairly common, almost necessary for there to be comorbidities with BPD, which could cause memory impairments in themselves. 

 I have bipolar 1 and an anxiety disorder with mine, a lot of people will probably have MDD, ADHD, ADD, bipolar and more as additional disorders along with BPD. 

I happen to know that when under stress, patients with MDD have a poorer working memory than patients with BPD, which means the affect MDD has on the brain in regards to memory are greater than that of BPD.

I understand completely with not wanting to message first, but in any relationship regardless of whether you're taking healthy space away, it's good to feel like you're able to message or reach out despite the other not doing the same.

I'm sorry I'm not the best at advice, the one thing I try to remind myself is my boyfriend cant read my mind, I need to be able to speak what's on it so he understands my worries and can reassure me while also knowing that it's not productive to assume what's going to happen based on what's happened to other people. 

If communicating with him isnt an option, maybe you can try to remind yourself that you're getting better so that you can have a productive relationship with him, that you're not the person these people who stigmatize are talking about, you're a beautiful soul who is learning day by day how to handle what you've been given and you need time to do so.

I'm sorry you have to experience this too."
BPD,exzl6z5,t3_cuuk7i,1566667903.0,"I've done this all my life, when i was younger i used to go off on my own when i was with groups of people (church, family & friends gatherings, etc.) and while I wanted to be alone I felt worse if nobody would come look for me, while also feeling dramatic and negative about it all. 

I still do similar, I like to go off on my own but I try to tell myself that I dont need anyone or that nobody cares about me. I basically set myself up for failure. When I'm away from the phone I feel much worse when I come back and nobody has messaged me."
