If therapy is an option, I highly recommend it. I found out by accident that my insurance actually does cover it despite the fact that all the documentation makes it sound like they don't. I can't emphasize enough that the most important thing for all of you while navigating this is being nice to yourselves. Negative self talk cycles are so destructive. Scolding yourself for being a failure never ever helps, and kids like this fall into this cycle quickly which only makes them more defiant because they think they will fail at things before they even try. No one is perfect and everyone struggles with something. Switching the dialogue from thinking about what should or needs to be done to what can you do to help yourselves or make life easier will help everything else.

It helps that I can relate and he can't say I don't understand, but the best advice I can give you is to avoid power struggles. They will always make things worse. Hard fast rules with no flexibility just don't work with kids like this. It's a hard line to navigate, because obviously there has to be consequences for things. One strategy I use it making my son pick his consequence after talking about how and why there has to be one. I also emphasize that my job as a parent is to prepare him for the real world, and we talk about the reasons we have the rules we do in this context. It takes time to find systems that work, but if one isn't working, let it go. Making the kid a part of those decisions helps a lot."

DiagnoseMe,eypx2wq,t1_eypnr9x,1567314565.0,"He nailed it. There is nothing to be lost by getting diagnosed, but if you are ADHD you will be grateful you did it. Once you 
know, it makes it easier to recognize and understand where you struggle and find ways to cope that aren't distructive. And school is definitely not real life. I did very well in school. I was diagnosed at 31, after I spiraled as an adult. 

I had no clue. And I was super resistant to medication, but once I was juggling a household, parent hood, and a high stress job, it became unmanageable. I read a thing on Reddit where someone said that there is no extra credit for living life on hard mode. And that hit me hard, because that's what I felt like I was doing every day. 

 Personally, medicating changed my life. There are so many options, not all of which are stimulants. I had a very negative impression of Adderall specifically, because of stigma from it being abused.  I've seen it enough that I was sure it was a bad thing. But I had some negative side effects with other things, and I finally tried it, and it gave me a level of calm and clarity that blew my mind. It still does. It's not at all like what I expected, and I've had very few side effects. I don't have any as long as I drink enough water. And I like that I only have to take it when I need it, and not every day. It's definitely not the same experience when you have a brain that benefits from them.

Medicating isn't what everyone needs. Or it 
may not be what you need right now. But there may come a day when you need help for whatever reason. Get through the diagnosing before that day can come, because going through that process when you are at a point where life is unmanageable is so stressful.

It's not an excuse unless you make it one. Everyone has a thing they struggle with. Adhd is definitely a thing that can be overcome or that can be manageable. Hell, at times it can even become a superpower, especially once you know how reign it in. My son has it too, and this is what I tell him. But knowledge is power, and it's really easy to miss the way that ADHD creeps in to so many things and parts of your life  you don't expect.
