I‚Äôve been an addict, still currently to marijuana tho I am managing that, and previously to addy, which to me felt like coke that lasted all day. I completely understand how you got addicted to such powerful feel good powder, but that‚Äôs all it is. It‚Äôs not a demon. It‚Äôs not a serial killer. It‚Äôs a drug. A drug that acts on receptors naturally in your brain to produce a response, like a release of dopamine, thus feel goods. The addiction part comes when you start using substance in a way that is unsustainable. Everyone sees it happening as well. The whole ‚Äúyou try it once you‚Äôre hooked‚Äù is complete bullshit. You can feel when it goes from oh yeah I‚Äôll try this tonight to sitting in your car before work and knowing you shouldn‚Äôt use that to get through it, and it‚Äôs making the right decision in those tiny moments that will win the battle for you. You‚Äôll feel the pangs of wondering if you should, and right then and there, dont. Feed the wolf thats been starving, I promise you he will be ecstatic to eat and come out of his slumber, awakening you into a much more beautiful balance in life. Though dont expect to escape some nausea as your wolf eats and your mind grows. Much love, good luck."

Psychonaut,fns9w1g,t3_g3lg04,1587216748.0,"Whatever you do don‚Äôt let him go. Be safe, but be there for him. Unless this is a residual feeling you get often and have ignored to this point, I think what you sensed was his negative energy, and it was being released, but maybe that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs tripping on acid with a friend rather than killing shit. I only say this because I had a very similar experience. I was invited to go to my buddies cabin with him and my other buddy. I had just taken acid, and it sounded like a great time, alone smoking weed at the cabin, so I went. Once it got completely dark out, I was in the passenger side seat and friend was in the back. Well just call him J. Anyway I started to get  bad vibes from him, everything he would say seemed to be a bit dark, and almost cryptic like you mentioned. He also had a pocket knife with him and I became completely convinced he was going to kill us both on the ride up there, or once we got there. I stayed sat forward on the whole ride, and even immediately got my friend alone( the driver) and asked if he sensed anything was off. He said no and was a closer friend to him so I kinda cleared up a bit. After awhile tho my one buddy passed out and was like out out, refused to wake up. I remember J saying something about like what if he never wakes up or something and anyway I ended up spending the night, tripping, with this guy. We did all kinds of stuff outside, smoked, heard coyotes at 4/20, just all in all a super weird night. He kept doing really strange actions and then would look at me like he was trying to get a response, though I think at that point I had told him I was on acid. The weirdest part for me even tho it was less dark than most was he picked up this big ass three pointed stick, carried all the way into the back, all the way to the lake, and then just lightly tossed it in the water at the bank. I asked him why he did that and he legit just said. ‚ÄúFor the fishes.‚Äù He also seemed to be unbelievably intelligent this night, like he would known so much about anything I could think about to bring up. So as the acid faded so did my seeing of the little darknesses in J. I convinced myself that he was like a leprechaun, kinda dark but all in all not bad. Anyway, I ended up going to college, and not even 2 months later he shot himself. Sorry for the long ass story, but this is your true friend the worst thing you can do rn is leave, wether or not he may be a ‚Äúpsychopath‚Äù. This page is literally called ‚Äúpsychonuats‚Äù, the two obviously have a foot in the same boat. Ask him about it, what may have happened was a opportunity for him to open up about things he may be going through was overlooked into more of a primal fear type of trip. Turning what could have been a flow and balancing, maybe even cleansing, into two separate energies colliding and combatting under the surface of your words. Tell him what you posted here, tell him what you were going through, maybe he thought you were the killer and was trying to judge your emotions based on emotional stimuli. Sorry for the rant, I would just hate to see someone else who still has so much to do leave so early. Good luck, stay safe. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
