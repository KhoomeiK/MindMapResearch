BPD,fpq5dw2,t3_geq0iw,1588815506.0,"Ya, all the time. Having BPD is absolutely exhausting. We set impossibly high standards for ourselves; so much higher than we hold others to. Sometimes I think the biggest challenge living with this illness, is being able to set realistic expectations for ourselves; without them, every day is rollercoaster of self-worth."
BPD,fppv0dw,t1_fp3p9ne,1588809692.0,"Thank you for writing this. I always feel like I’m the only broken toy in the store, and it’s comforting to be reminded I’m not alone."
NarcissisticAbuse,femakex,t3_epu9ra,1579246090.0,Your empathy is like crack for him. Is there anything an addict won’t do for their next fix?
NarcissisticAbuse,fem9nco,t1_fekx6di,1579244940.0,"I really wish more men would reach out to each other like the both of you did. I was my nex’s second husband, and I know she put her first husband through the same shit. My god what I wouldn’t give to go back and have him clue me in as to what the next near decade of my life was gonna be like with her."
NarcissisticAbuse,fem74wa,t1_fem28kl,1579242150.0,"Yes! I’ve absolutely felt that way; we all want that validation. My nex and I were together for 8 years, so I’ve been sucked back in an embarrassing amount of times. I’m not sure how strong that makes me (ty btw), but at least this the longest no contact we’ve had yet. One of the things I did different this time, was to make an “Icky” list; basically a list of all the cruel, manipulative shit they’ve ever pulled. I’ve kept adding to it as I go over and over the relationship in my head, so it’s pretty long now. Anyway, when I do catch myself idolizing her, and remembering how “good” it all was, I pull out my list and start reading. It’s been a pretty effective deterrent so far."
NarcissisticAbuse,fem1fg3,t3_epv1a6,1579236645.0,"Idk if it’s normal, but I feel the same way. At least when I quit smoking, the cravings mellowed out after a few weeks; it’s been nearly three months of virtually no contact, and still the urge to take her back is overwhelming at times."
