I've always known I don't accept compliments well but, honestly, as I'm writing this I'm only now realizing how poorly I accept them. I can't think of a single time when I've genuinely accepted one, without just saying the obligatory ""thanks"" and letting the compliment just slip out my other ear.

&#x200B;

I think giving him the note would be really nice. Personally, I've always felt like it's easy to just say things without meaning them which is probably why I've never given verbal compliments a second thought. However if someone took the time to thoughtfully write out nice things then I might be able to accept them more. It would also give me something concrete and tangible that I could use as ""proof"" for when my brain inevitably turns on me. If someone did that for me, that note would be in my possession for the rest of my life, especially if it was someone I was romantically interested in."

I think there's a way to block users on Reddit so they can't message you, which I would assume extends to post comments as well but I'm not 100% sure. Aside from that, sadly I think you're just going to have to try to ignore it. Try to remind yourself that these are just crappy people on the internet.

There was a period of time during the divorce when she would unleash so much anger and frustration towards me for anything I might have done wrong. She would threaten to leave and never come back.

If my mother, the one person whom I'm supposed to feel loved and supported by, can hate me that much, how am I supposed to even like myself?"

Now it really only helps me not actively feel my emotions while I'm exercising because I'm so focused on something.
