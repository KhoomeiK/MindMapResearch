For me, it always happens when I'm trying to sleep, and I always am so afraid that I feel like I'm having a heart attack, which scares me even more. I get short of breath, start shaking, sometimes even have cheat pain. I've tried techniques like breathing and whatnot, but none of it works. The only way I found is to watch TV and do anything to distract myself, or call my dad. Still, it takes hours"

This honestly sounds similar to me a couple years ago 😅 it's better to break up sooner than later, the longer you drag it out the harder it is. My ex gf was really hurt at first, but understood after a while and we became friends"
