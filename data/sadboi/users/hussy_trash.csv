FemaleDatingStrategy,fhwn02a,t3_f4q602,1581921353.0,"I‚Äôm a white chick, dating an Asian guy right now, and he initially accused me of fetishizing him. It was an interesting conversation because I thought he was the one fetishizing me (I‚Äôm an extremely pale, freckled redhead). So, we kind of ended up looking like that [Spider-Man meme.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/023/397/C-658VsXoAo3ovC.jpg) It ended up being that we both were just so used to people objectifying us, that we assumed it of each other. 

I would talk with the guys you meet about it, in the most direct way possible, to filter them out. I really like being fawned over, but the guys who fetishized me were honestly the worst relationships I ever had. It was much less fanning me with leaves and feeding me grapes, than I had hoped for. I always told myself it was their preference, but now I can tell the difference (for the most part). The guys objectifying redheads are really vocal about it. They put the red flags on themselves almost immediately. Personally, I try to avoid these types even if it does feel good to be someone‚Äôs ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù of something. It is bottom line dehumanizing and you deserve more than that."

abortion,f2dsl9k,t3_d9aw3p,1570163461.0,"That is a nightmare and I am sorry that you‚Äôre going through it. Sometimes it takes a situation like that for  people to realize how they feel in a relationship. Perhaps the situation made him look at the relationship you had and perhaps he realized that it wasn‚Äôt one that he wanted long term anymore. If that‚Äôs the case, it isn‚Äôt your fault and it isn‚Äôt because you were sad. Sometimes people just aren‚Äôt meant for each other and that‚Äôs okay. And a lot of the time it is easier and less painful to part on negative terms than to express it plainly and honestly. Either way this is a positive for you because if he feels this way, then anything past the realization is just wasting your time. This is my fear with my upcoming procedure. If it happens, I‚Äôll be back to this post, so I can read my own words to myself. We will be okay.

Update: I had my procedure yesterday and in a weird turn of events, the day before it was scheduled to happen, I told him that I wasn‚Äôt sure that I wanted to date him anymore. I didn‚Äôt feel like he was as supportive and there for me as I would like a long term partner to be. He listened and then asked me if we could just get through the next 24 hours together. I am glad I came back to this comment today."

I never said anything about it, but he would get drunk and say he had a small dick often. I never even considered that it was actually small until he started ranting about it. He was your size. It just was not something I had mentally noted. I know the sex was hot and I was so into this guy. I told all of my friends I wanted to marry him. It was honestly a crazy, intense situation. But we didn‚Äôt work because he started being a jerk and treating me like shit, not because of his size. I would have been with that smaller dick forever and had no issues with it. We just couldn‚Äôt do some positions and I never really even thought about that until right this moment.

Edit: Also, he was TERRIBLE at going down on me and I only orgasmed with him twice. But I still maintain the sex was bomb. Sex is strange like that."

It makes sense that this sub exists. I can‚Äôt believe that it makes up such a big part of some people‚Äôs identities. I feel for you guys. Not for the size, but because it bothers some of you so much. I don‚Äôt know many women who care one way or the other about size."
