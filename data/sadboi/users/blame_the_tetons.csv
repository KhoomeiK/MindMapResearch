Advice,fp31i6g,t3_gaz4sj,1588271488.0,"I didn't get diagnosed with ADD until college. I coasted through high school with good grades and never learned how to study or really even work hard. College totally kicked my ass in the beginning. I felt like you -- embarrassed, stupid, like I didn't belong there. I avoided my professors and TAs because I was embarrassed and didn't want to let people know I was struggling even though my grades made it super obvious. BUT. I finally went to my counseling center on campus. At first just to talk about feeling depressed and stupid and anxious about school. But she quickly suggested I might have ADD and set up the testing. It took some time and it was hard to admit to people I needed help, but there were so many people who did want to help me. If you go through your counseling center they can help you work with the academic services people -- you may get more time on tests or help with notes or a tutor or other non-medication services. 

Good luck! ADD is a tough one to deal with but you've got this."

Dogtraining,fnq06zf,t1_fnpwbwh,1587155208.0,Thank you so much! I will check these out. The tearables toy looks like a potential winner! I love the cardboard box idea as well. We were signed up for a nose work class this spring that's been cancelled but hoping to start her on that when things open back up. Thanks for your reply!
Dogtraining,fnpzxg8,t1_fnpwbny,1587155070.0,"We live in a townhouse so minimal outdoor space of our own for playing so we spend most afternoons at the dog park. She loves to lay there and rip the bark off a branch but this is also where the grass ripping happens so it really depends on her mood. 

I do have an antler for her as well as a couple bene-bone type toys that she likes to chew on but they dont hold her attention for too long."
Dogtraining,fnpzou6,t1_fnpvpph,1587154946.0,"I could try cardboard boxes, they're definitely a little heavier duty cardboard than those tubes. Thanks!"
Dogtraining,fnpzm3t,t1_fnptzpg,1587154907.0,"I used to buy cheap stuffies for my last dog and once made the mistake of getting one with the beans in the feet... I'll try this though and just pay better attention to the teddy bears I'm getting :)

The treat towel is a good idea, this dog definitely loves to use her nose. I think she'll love that. We've definitely been working on fetch and she's gotten much better/more interested but there's just something about a patch of grass that makes the rest of the world disappear."

Dogtraining,fm8zipg,t3_ftrkls,1585858894.0,At what age do puppies usually start moving to the right? And is there anything the humans need to do to make that transition easier?
rstats,fle921y,t1_fl2cye8,1585079867.0,"Hi there, thanks for your help! The name isnt a unique identifier unfortunately. In my data there are multiple locations per business name and I need to keep the license data at the location level. 

But despite that your code gets me exactly what I need -- license types by location, no duplicate entries. Thank you! So does that mean pivot\_wider automatically take into account all the other variables in the dataframe when determining how to collapse observations together? Very handy."
rstats,fle8bl0,t1_fl2a8bf,1585079479.0,"The name column is just a stand in for the name of the bar or brewery -- there are some that have more than one location, so one name might be associated with multiple locations. I'm hoping to end up with one row per location with three license variables to indicate whether a location has that license type (onsite, offisite, events). 

With your code (I appreciate your help) I have multiple entries for some locations --> how would I easily condense it so there is only one row per location?"

puppy101,f0p5is3,t3_d5xoz8,1568827632.0,I don’t have any advice but wanted to say thanks for asking the question - I’m going through this right now with my 5 month old golden retriever (!) and feeling like I must be a monster for my golden to feel so indifferent towards me. I’m hoping that time and cold weather bring out the cuddles a little more..
