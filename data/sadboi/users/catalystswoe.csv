The hardest part after getting out the hole we are in, is the call of familiarity in being in that hole. Don't make the same mistakes I did."

Nope. They are really a bunch of assholes. Been happier ever since I've gone no contact."
mentalhealth,fprzhtj,t3_gf4ia6,1588864915.0,"There is none. That is why you can do what you want, but care not to disturb others. 

Read about what you are interested in, listen to other people's stories, find the beauty in the most mundane things, feel the soft humming of the familiar machines around you, and let childish curiousity fuel you by observing things around you and asking why. 

We have the internet, search websites for what you are curious about. There are no dumb questions, only ignorant people. 

Read fantasy novels and digest every detail about sword fights, heroism, chivalry, magic, and the joy of experiencing an unknown land from another's eyes. 

Well doing these things will be worth it if afterlife just ends up with us stuck in the void."

Read, a lot. Fiction or non fiction. It will widen your perspective on things. You are already on reddit, why not read about other people's perspective? It will help you see what should be normal and what is actually wrong with the way things have gone around you. 

Reading fantasy helped for me as I am a bit of an overthinker. It might help distract you from your thoughts while eating up your attention. Especially with descriptions of a new or a forgotten land, mystical realms, and magic. 

I already commented on another post about podcasts. It helped me a lot keeping loneliness out. Find some genre you like, the internet has a lot to offer. And it gives the sense of seeming to be in a company with other people. 

And try to help others, it gives you a perspective outside of being in the box. Perhaps it will give you a different take on your problems."

depression,fpa07lt,t1_fp9zh7o,1588438177.0,Hmm. What if you put excerpts from research that would prove or disprove your opinions on how you became what you are now? That would help give it depth and realism to those 'regular' people. It could become big.

Try spending a day thinking about yourself. And only yourself. What you want to happen, what would you like to see, what kind of stuff do you like. Things like those. Dream, even if it seems impossible now. Don't worry about the process. Think about yourself for the moment. 

Read. A lot. And then you'll know what is the real normal. How to feel like a 'regular' person. You deserve better. And deep inside you know this."

mentalhealth,foyudoh,t3_ga8zr8,1588179344.0,"Hey. I don't know if this could help you like it did for me. I am no expert and all of these are just based on my experiences. 

Start a routine. Skin care, exercise, handicrafts, arts, or other stuff that could help you see slight improvements each time. Always set an exact time for each activity/routine. It will suck at first, as the starting point and keeping it up is the hardest thing to do.

Read on different topics. It doesn't have to be deep knowledge. Just surface level is fine. Feed your curiousity, just find out how things work. How rain forms, how seasons change. Even the most basic stuff. Enjoy them. Then, when you find the topic that interests you, only then you have to go deeper. 

Listen to podcasts, but only of those appropiate for your age. It is a great way to know about different topics and at the same time learn how to discuss topics and how to keep a conversation going. 

Read stories. Try to digest every single detail and imagine them. Start with short stories, simple ones. And probably the classic short stories, you could search online for better understanding of them. It will broaden your view. And you will see a bit farther. Figuratively of course. 

And that is all I could think of as of now. I hope everything works out for you. I will cheer you on."

dogs,fostzoy,t3_g988y4,1588038012.0,"Happened to me. A dog was abandoned in a box on an empty lot near our house. I found her while walking my senior dog. She was obviously scared. Baring fangs and growling at my dog. I returned later to see if I could help her. 

She was severely manged, full of ticks on her back, and barely have any fur left. She is very friendly to people, wagging her tail every time a person comes to feed her. 

She became a community project, people would come to feed her everyday. It was wet season on our country, so it would rain atleast once a day. I tried making her a makeshift roof just to shield her from the rain. People would improve it whenever they can. 

She eventually chose me over all the people who fed her. I was feeding her and she just jumped around with her tail wagging. It was that moment that, looking back, she chose me. She followed me home after. 

Stayed at the garage every night and left at mornings to go where she was abandoned. For two months, she gradually stayed at our garage longer and longer. When she was finally given a name and is accepted by our other dogs, she would still escape and go to the place where she was left. I think she was still hoping for that person to come back and get her. 

Bathing her was super easy. She is used to getting wet and being in the cold. After a few weeks of medicated bath, she is starting to regain her fur. At the first few weeks she would eat everything like it was the last time she would eat. 

She is a bundle of joy and energy. Everybody at our home is happy to be with her. She copied traits seen from our three other dogs. The energetic actions and responsibility of guarding the gates from our white dog, manchee. The graceful movements and protectiveness from my spotted mutt, duchess. And clinginess and the need to be the center of attention from our senior dog, duke. 

She is Bella. My happiness."
