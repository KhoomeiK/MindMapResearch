CPTSD,fq9z72b,t3_ghaozf,1589209896.0,"I have the same issue, caused by abuse from my stepdad when I was young. Any kind of short tone, passive aggressiveness, raised voice, etc sends off sirens in my head. I don‚Äôt freeze though, I generally get very defensive or start crying. No matter what the issue is. Makes working in customer service very challenging sometimes"
BPD,fq4sa8v,t3_ggqew3,1589082976.0,"My spouse(26m) and I(24m) met in art school, both of us coming from abusive relationships and families. We took a leap of faith and moved in together as soon as we started dating. He was in an unsafe situation and I was in the market for an apartment already. 

We lived together for a year before we got married at a courthouse. Granted, our first year of being married was a struggle. We both struggled with codependency and jealousy, plus getting over past trauma. We took out a lot of our anger on each other and didn‚Äôt know how to communicate our differences. 

We‚Äôre coming up on year 2 of being married (3 of being together) and I think our breakthrough was learning to compromise with each other. Often our biggest fights were caused by unwillingness to calm down and talk through issues. We learned each other‚Äôs triggers and soft spots, we learned what the other needs to feel valued. 

It‚Äôs a lot of difficult talks, tears, and eventually showing a side of myself that I wasn‚Äôt even comfortable with. It took a lot of time, patience, and forgiveness on both sides. It‚Äôs more than worth it in the long run though"
BPD,fpgjgaw,t1_fpgizqj,1588603907.0,"Oh yeah one of his negatives is he‚Äôs very aggressive and mean to everyone because of his trust issues and I definitely don‚Äôt want to pick up that anger. 

On another note you may or may not love this show, some people don‚Äôt like it because they relate to it too much, and then people like me love it for the same reason ü§£ it‚Äôs centered around living in poverty and dealing with fuckup parents"
BPD,fpgj7g3,t1_fpg8tt9,1588603771.0,"If you‚Äôre concerned you have autism instead of BPD really look into the causes of your behaviors, for example people with autism usually struggle heavily with identity when young so tend to cling to the identity of loved ones, repeating phrases and fixating on things. I used to feel a need to be exactly like people I admired even though it usually pushed them away. I ended up with a weird amalgamation of CPTSD and aspergers but I still find comfort reading accounts from people with BPD."
BPD,fpgishj,t3_gdadnp,1588603539.0,Probably not a good character to emulate but Mickey from Shameless...I‚Äôm a transgender man and feel his defensive masculinity and protective instinct for the people he loves. I‚Äôve been binging that show for months and find myself picking up traits from all the characters
BPD,foylz0l,t3_g9smkr,1588174904.0,"I spent a lot of my childhood/teenage years being gaslit for my input anywhere I went, I have aspergers so people would see me as socially ‚Äúdumb‚Äù and never actually listen. I used to deal with my emotions by exploding followed by isolation. They would control me for days to weeks at a time before I could see clearly. Communicating how I feel, even though I am now in a safe situation with trusted people, is still a challenge and I tend to make myself feel BAD for having strong emotion. 

What helps me is remembering what‚Äôs in my control and what‚Äôs not- in any given moment my reaction to emotions is my control. Usually it‚Äôs not worth it to fight back, but to bring it up in a calm, unbiased setting. Give yourself time to reach a calm and balanced state before communicating your feelings.

Long story short, your feelings ARE real and important to communicate. it‚Äôs good to learn ways to get your point across in ways to prevent misunderstandings on both sides. Be patient with yourself and others"

CPTSD,fn9qyk0,t3_g0eq31,1586782289.0,My mom made me read my sexual text messages between my bf and I at the time to the pastor at our baptist church.

I was still a virgin and very introverted so the whole thing was humiliating...you don‚Äôt know guilt until a church pastor looks at you like you‚Äôre the filth he wiped off his shoes that morning

BPD,f5u7f9b,t3_dp78ns,1572469421.0,"Not self absorbed, just searching for puzzle pieces to your identity. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôre really insecure about who you are, and struggle to find any positives, so it makes sense you want to cling to others ideas of your positives. Unfortunately this can lead to a really skewed perception of yourself, as your mind tends to hold on to strong negative opinions more than positive ones. They just seem to be louder. 

Sharing because I definitely relate. I found that asking trusted friends to affirm traits you think/don‚Äôt think you have is helpful as well."
CPTSD,f3zskr0,t3_dixzo4,1571276032.0,"Before even this step I think kids need to be educated on what trauma is. I struggled as a child to communicate my issues because I truly didn‚Äôt know what was okay and what was just normal discipline. I also thought my words wouldn‚Äôt mean anything because I didn‚Äôt have proof. 

Most kids won‚Äôt throw their parents or family under the bus either. Plus if the situation at home is abusive, intervening makes it even worse on the kid. 

This in theory seems like a great step towards child abuse awareness but I know if I had it when I was a child, it wouldn‚Äôt have helped at all"
