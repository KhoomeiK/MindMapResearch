learnart,fkdx1xh,t1_fkdb439,1584098550.0,"Thank you, I think I'll keep focusing on portrait drawing for the time being. And the features themselves. So I don't jump back and forth without figuring out what to actually focus on. Figure drawing I'd definitely enjoy, but for now that may bring an extra layer of difficulty."
ArtistLounge,fkdwl3g,t3_fhxpfy,1584098071.0,"There's one by moderndayjames, I think. Pretty sure he has the link on his youtube channel. But I tend to lose track of all the comments that are flooding by using discord, I don't seem to like it personally. But his channel is OK, there are dedicated rooms for feedback, progress, etc."
learnart,fkas2yr,t3_fhfy4z,1584018056.0,Done digitally in Procreate by using default HB pencil. Haven't got custom brushes yet.
GodofWar,fgim42s,t3_eyqc38,1580825517.0,I'm excited as well what might the story look like in the sequel. The Norse Gods are definitely angry with big old Kratos.
learnart,feqr084,t3_eqdk5f,1579345043.0,I love the vibrant colors you've got here.
learnart,feb5819,t1_fe6tgbz,1578955541.0,"Definitely figure, drawing expressive characters seems like it's fun - when I manage to draw it properly. Portraits although it may be helpful to draw I don't feel that it's something I'd like to do daily yet."
learnart,fe43ps0,t1_fe4259i,1578855514.0,"I did have fun drawing him. Surprisingly I've never drawn a character from animated movies before. But I might just go with it if it's fun. 

Edit: Just noticed that I did mess up his eye. Might fix that later."
KindVoice,fa6b5jl,t3_e7utf7,1575822940.0,Happy Birthday! Hope you'd have a wonderful day!
Advice,f0xulie,t3_d76vjh,1569047664.0,"As far as I'm aware nope. And I'm repairing insured iPhones  full time. If it's locked we don't repair it, and make it beyond economical repair."
Gotham,f0vz3yw,t1_f0vksxm,1568995237.0,I'm sure they can explore the setting of Pennyworth and first interactions with notable characters quite in-depth. The dark vibe it gives off is so nice. And I never skipped the opening theme. It's so good.
drawing,f0vd9ab,t3_d6rkp1,1568977218.0,"That looks really, really good. I wonder how the beak and the eye will end up looking. Looking forward to see it finished! Keep it up :)"
Gotham,f0rpn7c,t1_f0rp2n4,1568889897.0,"I loved Mentalist, up until last season. Something just didn't click with me about it. Oh well. Glad you're going to watch Pennyworth :) I'm fancying the british accents actors have, it's set in London anyway."
Gotham,f0pxq3s,t3_d61qki,1568849939.0,"Have you seen ""Pennyworth"" tv show? It seems really good, even though counts as a prequel to Gotham in a way. So far it's been enjoyable and a void half-filled after Gotham has ended. Same creator Bruno Heller."
lonely,ezhz5of,t1_ezhgpsi,1567918805.0,"That sounds like an interesting idea. Almost like a journal,  but I never seem to want to write anything in a notebook or whatever. Feels a bit odd. I'm reading a bunch of books on personal growth,  can't say that any helped me."
lonely,ezhylv6,t1_ezh9jb1,1567918580.0,"I get unusually happy when someone talks with me, I end up hoping that there could be a chance to become friends. Alas, nothing happens other than a general greeting. Not sure about the wrong people, I don't meet many anyways."
lonely,ezhxy8u,t1_ezhwune,1567918301.0,"Out there? Where? It's not like I can sensibly explore the whole Earth just to find someone. I do like to travel though. I can't seem to click with any people, it almost feels like no friendships can form the moment I start talking."
drawing,eywn3vh,t1_eywjvgn,1567533295.0,"You definitely nailed the exercise. I only managed to draw skulls, rendering never comes easy for me."
drawing,eyweorc,t3_cz6ptf,1567527743.0,Looks like a real deal. So good. The details are astonishing.
learnart,eytmwwz,t1_eytgdhp,1567440656.0,"I've skipped all of them before, even when I was serious about art. But might try nonetheless."
learnart,eytmt9w,t1_eytb3md,1567440584.0,Saw it. The same reference surely. Though I haven't tried to paint the one I drew. Never was good with painting to begin with.
learnart,eys075k,t1_eyrw3lh,1567383307.0,"Thank you. I'm willing to try drawing for the whole next month, might be fun to follow the themes of inktober."
learnart,eyrm8k5,t1_eyrk0ah,1567372267.0,Haven't planned to finish It. Not sure how might I handle more subtle details. Hair as well. I tried to roughly paint it but it turned out so messy that I decided to leave it as is. For now. Could try and finish it somehow.
ArtistLounge,ewmgrt4,t3_coy1v8,1565551279.0,"That's so sweet! Congratulations, truly! I would've been as happy as you if someone were to appreciate the artwork I made over the years. A bit stagnant recently though. But it happens quite often for me, I end up getting back on track eventually."
solotravel,ewi68zr,t1_ewi60gb,1565440037.0,"My bad, never posted here before I'll update the post. But for now quick bits of information- 

I'm based in UK,  it's comfy for me to travel from Stansted Airport. Not decided about the budget. The cheaper the better. Somewhat. Like not more than 300-400 pounds preferably. 

Mainly tourist attractions I'm interested in, but also I enjoy to just walk around the city and explore it slowly. No clubs, no pubs nothing of the sort."
socialanxiety,ewi5c4c,t3_coh5zs,1565439001.0,Just me and those who prefer not to notice.
Anxiety,ewew6v8,t3_cnmz0o,1565340545.0,Haha this happens every day for me lately. Sleeping for more than 5 hours seems like a luxury for me.
MakeNewFriendsHere,ew971zf,t1_ew96cb7,1565220653.0,Sure why not.
MakeNewFriendsHere,ew958s8,t1_ew93p60,1565219850.0,Glad you're positive about it. Personally I'm not convinced it's possible
MakeNewFriendsHere,ew92zhp,t1_ew900jq,1565218847.0,Might be looking in the wrong places probably. Haven't had the chance to meet those kinds of people. Yet.
MakeNewFriendsHere,ew8ztv6,t3_cn4rei,1565217516.0,Where are those people?
MakeNewFriendsHere,ew7nxu4,t1_ew6y3uy,1565194648.0,"I'd like that, I have discord so would be nice to talk there maybe plus the chat is better in a way. At least I can attach media. 

Over excited is not a stretch, I can end up talking without stopping and it makes the extroverted people wonder what's going on."
MakeNewFriendsHere,ew7nlok,t1_ew7c5pk,1565194505.0,Cool I'm up for a talk with you. Fun little fact - I've been in Minsk as well. 10 years ago once but still.
drawing,ew6nnhu,t3_cmxbwy,1565176969.0,That looks gorgeous! So detailed and if you had a photo of the doggo next to the painting I probably wouldn't tell the difference. Maybe the tongue might be the only difference I could see.
nier,ew0x1vg,t1_ew0vy04,1565009025.0,"A and B playthrough add a few subtle differences, for one 9S playable instead of 2B. Also a bit more backstory to machines when played as 9S. Plus hacking minigames are common during 2nd playthrough. Names of bosses are revealed instead of symbols during 1st playthrough as 2B. Just something from the top of my head."
nier,ew0ttl5,t3_cm9umv,1565005844.0,Which game exactly? Should have included that in the post somewhere.
Needafriend,evzmzni,t3_cm32up,1564961861.0,"That was touching to read, could we talk, please?"
MakeNewFriendsHere,evym73n,t1_evylx7y,1564935937.0,Hmm I reckon it requires multiple people to play it properly.
nier,evy535g,t1_evy4o46,1564922727.0,I'm curious as well.
MakeNewFriendsHere,evxt70t,t3_clrpsj,1564906504.0,What are those cards against humanity and how does one play? I'd like to try at least.
learnart,evw892z,t1_evw812q,1564857608.0,"Yes, other piece of paper. Usually it wouldn't smudge as long as you don't actively rub the drawing surface with it. Copy paper would do, it's cheap and you wouldn't need to use the extra paper from your sketchbook."
learnart,evw7o55,t3_clm1rm,1564857194.0,"Have a piece of paper under your arm in which you hold your pencil, should hopefully help. Or even under the other one. That way you wouldn't touch the drawing directly with your fingers. Been a long while since I drew traditionally though."
socialanxiety,evvcm1k,t3_clh7hc,1564831323.0,"Happens a lot to me. I can be outgoing when I talk with people I know really well, but when it comes to talking with people I don't  know I end up becoming nervous and stutter like hell. Especially if that were a girl."
socialanxiety,etmwtpg,t1_etlzdwx,1562970587.0,"Hasn't gone the way I anticipated, and it might be far easier if I didn't try to approach her at all. Couldn't even say ""Hi"" properly, without me being at a loss of words. At least she smiled once. I give up, talking to women isn't my thing. Should just accept that there won't be a single one who would like to talk with me. In a few months I'll be 28 and the thought of being single with each passing year makes me almost have a bit of a nervous breakdown once in a while."
socialanxiety,etmvxse,t1_etl30r6,1562969933.0,"Thanks. I tried to approach her but all I succeded at was making a fool out of me. She was confused about my nervousness, so I think it's better if I just avoid the embarassment and eyecontact as well. She's on different shift next week anyway."
Art,etlfqmh,t3_ccaaam,1562935046.0,That is so detailed! How long did it take to complete roughly? I imagine that required quite the determination. That's amazing either way!
nier,etkx33f,t1_etkamkk,1562911874.0,Thank you! I was a bit hesitant to post it though as its not finished and there's  lots of fanart posts with miles better artwork.
nier,etkwv7z,t1_etjwje0,1562911651.0,"Tyvm! I wanted to start with something more ambitious(2B and 9S next to each other, facing outward, with some background),  although that might have to wait until my art skills improve a little."
nier,etkwnwn,t1_etkm37k,1562911445.0,"Thanks a lot. I ended up getting back to drawing last week, prior to that had a year of inactivity. Ended up feeling a little too much frustrated over my lack of visible progress I guess. Like I can't really paint well, even though I'm amazed at artists who do."
nier,eszli8u,t1_esykl9z,1562363997.0,"Why is the same game called differently? The original Nier I mean. I don't think I'll even attempt to play PS2 drakengard games, they seem quite dated. Even PS3/X360s Nier looks a lot more slowpaced than the latest entry."
nier,esyl5f0,t1_esydpou,1562345079.0,"Yeah, it's amazing that I'm getting inspired to draw by a game I knew nothing about prior to my first flight encounter. I even have some general ideas what I would like to draw although finding the right references without them being exaggerated, or sexualised is tough. I want to find the background image under PS4 n:A game menu when you scroll down to see trophies, etc. No luck so far. But I'd like both 2b and 9s in the drawing, standing next to each other facing outward like that < || > Hopefully that makes sense. Plus A2 would be nice to be able to draw. But I don't have an idea how would I be able to include her in the same drawing yet. Might just do that separately and guess I'll just focus on drawing these characters who have impressed me immensely."
nier,esyk4gk,t1_esxej5u,1562344647.0,"Sadly I have no way to play other games since they are not on ps4 or at the very least pc. Though I would've wanted to learn more about who exactly is or rather was Emil. Since who we meet in game is apparently a clone. He mentioned Kaine during last fight with him, and he sounded like he's been tortured for millennia. Guess I could try to at least watch walkthrough. What is the drakengard franchise? Is it tied to Automata as well? Or just hinted at?

edit: Wasn't sure what was the actual name of the ""Drakengard"" games."
nier,esyi8pt,t1_esxxbgy,1562343870.0,"I've read and watched it. Left me a bit confused though. Like 2B was ""resurrected"" 72 days later, yet how would that be possible is unbeknownst to me. Also 9S was definitely dead and restoring him would have been quite the dilemma, which almost magically happens in the end by sheer perseverance of 2B. Alrhough she was devastated the vaccine had no effect at all. Also I am a little confused what exactly their relationship was/is. Siblings, lovers, or something else entirely, perhaps soulmates who despite being apart find their way to meet each other? And yet 2B was ordered to execute 9S over, and over again. That left significant impact on her psyche, I guess. Since in game she tried to hide her emotions, become distant from him."
PS4,epahbic,t1_ep9qe8v,1559128001.0,"Those undead soldiers from all three games annoyed me so much, and  I wanted all of the games to end faster after first encounter with each of those monstrosities. I do not even recall the antagonist of the last game, neither did I care about him much. Rise's antagonists were better.  And each location seemed very similar in SotTR, except tombs were nice. Never bought season pass and got rid of my copy of the game recently.

It was opposite for me once 2nd part of U4 started I got hooked, and last boss fight was awesome. Finally a bossfight where I didn't need to unload thousands of bullets to make the encounter over with... 

 Lost legacy follows Chloe and Nadine, at first I thought that's silly to pair them together but overall it was a nice game, slightly shorter than it's predecessor."
PS4,ep9ozo2,t3_bub5yw,1559113710.0,"The writing of these 3 games is very poor, sometimes made me cringe. Rise was decent enough, but Shadow is imo ""How to ruin a franchise 101"". The plot was so silly, main antagonists weren't as good as in Rise and overall quality of the game was downgraded. And no double pistols, could have been a nod at least during the end of shadow but nope. Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy were miles better in terms of storytelling. While tomb raider reboot trilogy had quite satisfying ways to kill enemies stealthily. I do not want to replay any of these 3 TR games, especially not the last one."
