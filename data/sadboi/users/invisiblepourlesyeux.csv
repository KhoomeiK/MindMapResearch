So you can‚Äôt build bone after that point, but if you‚Äôre still in that age range you may restore some lost bone density. Generally speaking weight restoration is considered restoring to your pre-ED biologically accurate weight. Since you were so young when yours started, wed want to look at where you were on your growth curve (%ile weight, %ile BMI) to get an idea of what full restoration weight would be. It can be hard to get over a hump with weight, but the struggle may be due to lacking appetite cues which don‚Äôt tend to come back fully until you‚Äôve been eating adequately for some time. 

As far as menstruation that‚Äôs fantastic you got your period back and definitely a good sign! It is possible to have a period and still be under biologically accurate weight, but I‚Äôm not sure if this is what‚Äôs going on for you. It‚Äôs hard for me to judge what might be going on without doing a full assessment. You may have your doctor test your estradiol (estrogen) levels to make sure they‚Äôve returned to normal range - if not that will at least give you some idea that you might need to restore further.

EatingDisorders,fj0bebf,t1_fizbcgo,1582895552.0,"I‚Äôm glad that I can help you feel less alone. When I was in college and struggling with my own ED, the only friends I had talk to me about their own struggles were both male. And neither ever got treatment so they aren‚Äôt part of that 1 in 4 statistic. 

There are lots of different reasons that can cause hospitalization or death - it can be liver failure due to the rapid weight loss, it can be organ breakdown from protein deficiency, or electrolyte imbalances leading to cardiac failure. I know it doesn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôll have trouble stopping now, but obsession with food is a byproduct of starvation. 

There‚Äôs a study known as the Minnesota Starvation Experiment where they took healthy men (screened for both physical and psychological health) and put them on a calorie restricted diet (I think 1500 calories). They all started showing a lot of the physical and psychological symptoms we see in EDs - obsession with food, food hiding, recipe hoarding, irritability, poor judgement and poor concentration,,
 depression, decreased energy, poor temperature regulation. And this is only 1500 calories! I don‚Äôt know any of my clients who come to me eating even that much. 

There‚Äôs this phenomena I see with my clients where after they are eating enough or once they hit a certain weight it‚Äôs like their brain just ‚Äúclicks‚Äù out of the obsession. And it‚Äôs a pretty stark difference. I‚Äôve heard so many people say that they‚Äôll stop at a certain weight/size/whatever but it never ends up being enough. I was one of those people - just didn‚Äôt want to be fat anymore and ended up with a 10 year eating disorder (that still pops up in my brain sometimes after almost 10 years of recovery).

Another study you might find of interest is the biggest loser study - they followed participants after the show and not only did most (if not all?) of them regain the weight, but despite weight regain they continued to have metabolic suppression of 500 calories a day. Despite being fat again, their metabolism was burning 500 fewer calories than it was before. And their fat mass / lean mass ratio ended up significantly worse. 

I know it is so hard when weight loss is supposed to be this magic cure everybody should be pursuing, but I don‚Äôt know that this approach is going to get you where you want to be. I hope you‚Äôll consider talking to someone, or if nothing else at least eating a bit more. Because I hate for this to be the next 20 years of your life.

EatingDisorders,fix0ldb,t3_faa2ke,1582809493.0,"Honestly this is all extremely concerning and it sounds like you have a pretty severe eating disorder. I‚Äôm an ED clinician and I do work with men - I think the statistics are 1 in 4 people with EDs are males, however that‚Äôs only diagnosed and my guess is that there are more that are not diagnosed due to stigma. Very few of my clients fit the stereotypical ‚Äúlook‚Äù of an eating disorder. 

I know you hate your body right now and it might not seem like a concern, but restrictive eating disorders can have the same life-threatening effects on your organs regardless of weight. There are people who end up hospitalized with organ failure despite remaining in an ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù or ‚Äúobese‚Äù body - all because they are eating so little. I would really encourage you to talk with a professional about what‚Äôs going on because it‚Äôs not going to be so simple to stop once your body is smaller. 

I have a male client right now with a similar story - at least similar in that he started restricting in a larger body. Despite being currently underweight he still views himself the same way he did when he was larger and it is an every day battle to eat. You deserve more than that.

You may also be zinc deficient after eating so little for so long which can contribute to taste changes and food aversions. 

There is also a significant impact of anxiety on the GI system - slowing it down, speeding it up, changing hunger cues. I would certainly discuss the anxiety symptoms with a therapist as treating the anxiety might make eating a lot easier, even improving your physical symptoms. Sometimes gastroenterologist even have therapists they can recommend that work specifically with GI concerns. 

If I HAD to give you an ED diagnosis I would go with ARFID, but a lot of people don‚Äôt meet all the criteria for any specific disorder.

Additionally - ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù and even ‚Äúobese‚Äù individuals who incorporate cardio exercise regularly are actually at a lower risk of all cause mortality than thin individuals who do not exercise (several studies from the Cooper clinic show this). 

I know the binging/purging part feels like the shameful/bad part & the part that you want to change.

I‚Äôm an eating disorder dietitian and with my binging or b/p clients I always focus on reducing restriction first to prevent nutritional/physiological triggers of binging.

AskWomenOver30,f8vcda4,t3_e29b3d,1574865943.0,"There are lots of skincare things others have already mentioned that may help with the appearance of aging, but it‚Äôs not a cure all. I think we also have to acknowledge the cultural attitude that women aren‚Äôt allowed to age (at least here in the US). There‚Äôs this weird expectation that we‚Äôre supposed to look like we‚Äôre in our earlier 20s for the rest of our lives. And we ALL eventually age - no matter how much water we drink, how much sunscreen we wear, what we eat, how we exercise. Bodies age. 

From a body image perspective, when we don‚Äôt see bodies/faces that look like ours it can feel like we don‚Äôt fit in. Not having regular exposure to bodies and faces with signs of aging doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt exist, it just means the images we are shown constantly are very curated and edited. Even the pictures our friends post! Like holy crap I never knew about facetune until recently, and so many times I can‚Äôt even tell when stuff is edited anymore. It‚Äôs hard to find, but try to seek out natural pictures of women at different ages. It can really really help to see ourselves reflected and normalized.

With the comparison to friends - remember that no matter what they look like now they will eventually age just as much. There may even be some distortion or exaggeration of the perceived difference based on our own insecurities. I‚Äôm also not sure how much makeup your friends wear or how many procedures they‚Äôve had or how much they spend on skincare each month, and you likely don‚Äôt know either. 

You might also try reading about cultures who have a greater respect for aging - it might help you to look differently on the process. I like to remember that a lot of the ‚Äúflaws‚Äù our bodies show are really just remnants of what our bodies have carried us through and carried us through the best they can. And signs of aging are signs that we‚Äôve lived longer than a lot of people get to. If we have the body of a 20 year old when we die, we‚Äôre probably not much older than 20. And what a sad life that would be.

I would also suggest looking into mindful self compassion - research shows that self compassion is actually more effective than self esteem in improving how we feel towards ourself. Self esteem is based on qualities/achievement that may or may not be consistent over time while self compassion is about how we treat ourselves - even when we‚Äôre struggling to like our situation very much. I love the Mindful Self Compassion Workbook - I‚Äôm not super far into it for myself, but the practices I have implemented have been so helpful for me to be less hard on myself.

Also - maybe he‚Äôs got some kind of fetish or fantasy that it‚Äôs difficult to orgasm without. This can be touchy because he might be too embarrassed or ashamed to bring it up, but finding out what helps him orgasm when he‚Äôs alone might be helpful."

TwoXSex,f6d0bqt,t3_dqx8b5,1572790215.0,"If you know that you are his only partner and you do decide not to use condoms, I would ask that he get an STD test to be on the safe side. Not all STDs carry symptoms, and I believe this is even more common for males (for example he may not have symptoms but you could). 

Condoms do reduce the sensation (as a woman I find it reduces the sensation for me too), but making sure the condom fits well is important to allow for as much sensation as possible. They do make some thinner condoms so that may help too. If you do choose to use a condom (as backup BC or for STD protection), make sure to pinch the tip when you put it on so there‚Äôs room for his cum and make sure he pulls out after he finishes. If he stays inside you or tries to keep going, some can leak out placing you at greater risk of stds/pregnancy.

Make sure you get plenty warmed up - lots of foreplay - so that you‚Äôre wet enough for it to be comfortable. If you‚Äôre not it can be painful (and may even still be somewhat painful if you haven‚Äôt broken your hymen yet). If you‚Äôre nervous or can‚Äôt make enough moisture on your own for whatever reason it is okay to use some lube! Take things slow and tell him if you feel uncomfortable or something doesn‚Äôt feel right - good sex is all about communication! Communicating what feels good, what doesn‚Äôt, and making sure all parties feel comfortable and safe :)

Also, don‚Äôt expect the penetration part to last super long (also a reason for plenty of warm up!). Part of this is that he has less experience so he may be more excited and cum faster, part of this is that the average time to ejaculation is about 7 minutes (whereas the average time for a woman to orgasm is 13 minutes, and some women take much longer). Try not to make orgasm the goal and just enjoy the experience - it probably won‚Äôt happen with it being you‚Äôre first time, and many women don‚Äôt orgasm from vaginal stimulation alone so don‚Äôt put too much pressure on yourself or on the experience :)

For positions - you‚Äôll have to experiment with what feels good for you. Nothing wrong with missionary! You may find you like doggy style as some women find this provides better stimulation of their gspot and better access to their clit for dual stimulation.  Girl/receiver on top gives you more control over the angle and depth of penetration which works well for me. Guy (or giver) on top with your legs over his shoulders allows for deeper penetration, but not everyone enjoys that and it might not be comfortable with it being your first time. I know this also makes some guys orgasm faster. Experiment with hip angles, moving with his movements. If you find a place that feels good just keep doing that!

Remember that you don‚Äôt have to know everything about sex or what you like just yet - so much of sex and sexuality is going to be exploring (either on your own or together) so take your time and know it gets better and better the more you get to know yourself and your partner!"

dietetics,f0duett,t3_d45w1e,1568558744.0,"Private dietitian here - I work with eating disorders which is more niche and work in an area with several treatment centers. I started working part time for another RD who already had a practice and worked 8-12 hours/wk (4 hour shifts 2-3 x/wk) on top of my day job. I left to my own office after discovering that practice was not a great fit. Fortunately my day job was flexible and valued me, so they allowed me to cut my hours to 30 hrs/wk as my business grew and I eventually quit to give myself more scheduling flexibility to further grow my practice. Being married helped a lot because I was able to be on my husbands insurance and while it was tight he was able to support us as long as I made enough to cover office rent, but fortunately expanding my availability helped me to grow. The biggest things that helped me get clients were networking with both therapists and treatment centers and taking (some) insurance. Most of my clients come from direct referrals from other professionals, so it certainly helps to be in a very collaborative field. Not a lot of RDs in my field accept insurance so I started getting referrals that way, and eventually got a pretty good reputation so I get more of a mix now. 

I absolutely hate the marketing /schmoozing part of things so I did take things pretty slow. I was very part time for 2-3 years before eventually trying to make my practice full time. I know it‚Äôs tempting to see everyone, but honestly be specific about the clients you want to see and get really good at it, and make sure you connect well with the people who can refer you those specific clients, as well as RDs with different specialties who can refer those that aren‚Äôt a fit for them. So if you want to do diabetes connect with hospitals, PCPs, and endocrinologists. If you want to work with GI conditions connect with gastroenterologists (trust me they are looking for good RDs). Communicate well and update your referral sources on mutual client progress (with a release) - really helps to build your reputation. Join with local professional groups within your specialty, bonus if they are cross-disciplinary. I‚Äôm sure there are other ways into this or things I haven‚Äôt had to deal with -  I know social media can help a lot with getting individual clients, but honestly I hate it so I don‚Äôt mess with it most of the time. 

To answer the last part of your question - I fucking love it. Not a fan of a lot of the business aspects, but it allows me to do exactly what I want to do and practice in a way that fully aligns with my own ethics. (which unfortunately I was having to compromise to get a paycheck from someone else). Also - I personally use Simple Practice, but billing/scheduling software is a GODSEND.

Also do not expect to make bank. I do okay, but self employment taxes are a bitch."
