Whoever told you this probably found their soulmate in college but that doesn't mean you'll find yours. I know someone who met hers when she was 14 and I know other people who didn't meet someone until they were into their late 20s or even 30s. My point is that it's different for everyone.

That's perfectly fine. Find time to explore if you need to. College is an excellent time for that. 

Relationships, and life in general, are not a linear path. They're vary by people and your path is not the same as everyone else's. I think you should start by just making friends and try to be social when possible.

TheLastAirbender,fkf1hbp,t1_fkezqib,1584125109.0,"You seem very set in your beliefs about this show so here are a few points before I step out. 

1. Lightning bending is a skill. The internet is not this making for a bad allegory. The internet is not something you *learn*. Take art for example, there are good artist and bad ones and there are those who are exceptional. Lightning bending was done by more advanced and/or exceptional benders. They had to *learn* and even then not everyone was successful. 
2. A melting pot is something where you are expected to give up your own culture and conform to American culture. They need to assimilate and ""be American"". The melting pot theory is literally based on assimilating and giving up that uniqueness to fit in. Which is what republic city was. That is not the case for all countries. No, Canada is not a melting pot as far as I have lived here. I have never felt the need to be ""more Canadian"" but have felt that from every trip to the states. Speaking as a visible minority. 
3. They explained the magic by explaining how the bending came to be. It was unnecessary and the whole Ravaa vs. Vatuu arc was weak. It was literally a light vs. dark thing where as in ATLA every nation thought they were the good guys and doing the right thing. Which was what made it a more interesting story rather than a good vs bad. There was a deeper look at morals rather than a black and white good vs bad.


If you're actually open to a different perspective on the show, this person makes some good points. Otherwise you seem to be reiterating what you've said and don't seem to be bringing anything new to this.

Showing why he exists is explaining the magic. It does in fact explain the mystery of who the avatar is and why he exists.

TheLastAirbender,fkew48q,t1_fkeufu2,1584121907.0,">The ONLY ""American"" influence we see in ALoK is a few Manhattan and Liberty island vibes in Republic City (which is primarily based on Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tianjin). Also, don't act as if ATLA was devoid of westernization.

LoK took away a lot of what made each nation unique. ATLA did have western influences but Republic City is a very American thing. It gets rid of the individual cultures all the nations had. It was a huge melting put, which is what the US is. You don't see the individual cultures anymore. It's not just the visuals, it's the political stuff that went with it. 

>How? The United Republic is its own culture and the other nation still have their own unique cultural identities. How exactly does one new city undermine that?

It's not it's own culture. It's a melting pot that is devoid of any unique cultural identities. The focus is a lot more political with Zahir's whole anarchy bit. That's a very American thing, to make everything about politics. No, not all countries do that. Speaking as a non-American, not everything we do is about politics. 

>it gives more depth to the Avatar lore.

Lore that I personally didn't think was very well done and therefore unnecessary. He basically stole magic from the lion turtles. Just makes him look like a prick honestly. 

>The internet was once only used by computer experts or enthusiasts. But now we live in the Digital Age where everyone relies on it. Things become widespread with time.

The internet and lightning bending are no where near the same thing. Lightning bending and metal bending were things that could be achieved if you were highly skilled but it seemed like every other Joe off the street could do those things now.

TheLastAirbender,fker73z,t3_fi1xrc,1584118985.0,"My issue with LoK was that it kind of took all of the world building that was done in ATLA and Americanized it all. I loved how different each nation was, they had their own culture, values, etc and LoK kind of destroyed that with Republican City. 

It bugged me how fast technology progresses too. It took about 50 years to get from no electricity to cars and cameras and whatnot. Let's not forget that it also seemed to devalue some things that were considered to be special in ATLA. Like lightning bending for example. It's not something easy and not everyone can do it but it's such a common thing in LoK that it kind of lost the magic. They use it like it's no big deal and that any bender can learn it. 

Speaking of magic, *never explain the magic*. When you explain the magic, it ruins things. They did not need to explain how the avatar came into existence. They exist for their own purpose and I think that was enough. She also seems to be a bit liberal with the Avatar State which makes it seem less important.

canada,fenufz3,t1_fent2jw,1579290938.0,"You live in a socialist country. Your money won't always be used for stuff you like and that's part of the deal. Don't like it? Move elsewhere. 

However, if you read the article it states that getting the money from Iran can take a while. What's wrong with helping out in the meantime? 

Accidental deaths that happen in Canada on a smaller scale can be dealt with here. People get payouts from companies or can go to court if needed. It's probably not as easy to do this when the accident took place outside of the country and most of the world is watching. I doubt most people get on a plane thinking they're going to die."
canada,feniepq,t1_fenhsl8,1579285358.0,"Not everyone has or can afford to get life insurance. 

Edit: Not everyone thinks about getting in a plane and dying. No one said it's the tax payers responsibility but for those of you bitter about ""the tax payers paying for it"" here's the math:

They're paying $25,000 to every family of the victims. There are 57 citizens and 29 permanent residents (86 people total). 

86 x $25,000 = $2,150,000 total pay out. 

As of 2019, the population of Canada sits at around 37.59 million people. Let's round that down to 37 million for the sake of this problem. 

So if 37 million people are putting together 2,150,000, how much would it cost each everyone? Let's see:

2,150,000 ÷ 37,000,000 = 0.058

Since we are talking about money we need to round that to the closest cent which would be $0.06. That's what you're paying to help with this. You are literally giving up 6 cents to help people these people. If you want to be petty over 6 cents to help someone out, then maybe you need to reevaluate a few things. 

 I would like to point out that this is just a rough estimate. Even if you are paying maybe 10 or 20 cents, what's the big deal? Are you honestly so cheap that you can't spare 20 cents to help someone out?"
AmItheAsshole,fehzzva,t1_fehwybr,1579127325.0,"I'm happy with how I was raised too. It's good that you know how you'd handle and allowance but that doesn't mean everyone else would handle it the same way. 

To be fair, my parents started off small. It started it $5 and went up as my expenses grew. Their general rule of thumb was ""If it's for school (or a necessity like food or clothes), we'll pay. Anything else, you pay for yourself."" Wanna go to a movie with friends? Great, that's what the allowance is for. 

I used to save up all the money to buy books and video games because they weren't something my parents were willing to pay for unless the books were for school. I think it was a good rule and it helped me understand how to handle my money and the difference between needs and wants. I budgeted my money a lot better once I got a job and it definitely helped with not spending it all on useless crap."
AmItheAsshole,fehvz57,t1_fehqsni,1579124961.0,">You are the reason he is ungrateful for letting him get used to something very unrealistic.

My parents gave me an allowance growing up. It was a weekly thing so I wouldn't say it's unrealistic. I know a bunch of people who got allowances growing up as well. It was like $20 a week and it taught me how to handle money. 

>My college was full of kids that never really had to work, and they were the ones getting drunk every night and doing coke with their dads money. I'm not saying this will happen to your kid, but you're increasing the chances of that. I would HIGHLY suggest giving your kid absolutely nothing besides necessities so he doesn't grow up in a fantasy land and have no idea what to do when daddy cuts him off.

Giving your kid money doesn't mean they ALL end up that way. Not all kids who get money from their parents end up spoiled. 

I think it's okay if the guy wants to help his friend out but asking for a raise is a bit much. I would suggest his son get a part-time job if he wants to spend all his money on his friend."

relationship_advice,fdm48b3,t3_em2win,1578539410.0,"I felt that way about my ex and it's part of why we didn't work out. We were together for 5 years but I always felt like I had to fit into his life rather than us building a new one together. He talked about it but it was always sort of about him and what he wanted. He didn't want his current life to change, he was happy to keep things the way they were which meant there was no room for me. 

I tried talking to him about it multiple times but he just brushed it aside or made excuses for why I had to make all the compromises in our life. Have a chat with him about it. If things don't change, maybe it's time to let go. You shouldn't have to fight for a place in his world. I spent way too long doing that and honestly wouldn't recommend it."
