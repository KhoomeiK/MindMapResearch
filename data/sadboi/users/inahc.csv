today, though, I woke up with a stomach ache and shitty dreams, so I decided fuck it, extra sleep is good again. and the nap did fix the stomach ache, but I had to promise myself hot chocolate to get out of bed afterwards, and now I'm here on the internet instead of cleaning the bathroom.

Anxiety,f1npbsk,t3_da630z,1569622695.0,"look into CBT, DBT, mindfulness/meditation, medication - just try lots of things and see what sticks. rewiring your brain does take time, talk to your therapist about how much time you can afford to take off and what your options are after that.  also, some medication will suppress your symptoms in a way that makes it harder to rewire your brain (benzos especially), while other medications (eg. ssris, snris) will make it easier to rewire your brain."
Anxiety,f1noci8,t3_da4dso,1569621955.0,"how about we look at this from another angle - maybe it's not about embarrassment at all, but about consent. Twice your boyfriend asked for your consent, and when you said no, he tried to argue you out of it. It's an understandable habit (I haven't quite broken myself of it either), but not a good one.

&#x200B;

No means no, goddamnit. And when you can trust someone to actually listen to your no, it's a lot easier to reach a point where you can freely say yes in the future."
Anxiety,f1g1cnz,t3_d98i1j,1569457711.0,"sometimes I'll pair an interesting thing with a mandatory thing - like, I have to get out of the house for an appointment, so after that's done it's easier to stop at something nearby before I go home. Especially if I can have chocolate afterwards. :)"
Anxiety,f1g0p05,t3_d9927h,1569457286.0,"I dunno, but I think it would be fine for *you* to find alternative ways of managing things, for your own sake.

Anxiety,f1fzquq,t3_d997cl,1569456670.0,"not during sleep, but I've had those when muscles in my head get too tense. ..although the dizziness I get when the muscles relax *after* having been tense, I think."
Anxiety,f1fml7o,t3_d9642h,1569447816.0,"the weird thing is, I can feel very relaxed when I travel, even though I don't exactly feel *safe*. like, I'm home, it's nice and safe and a relief, so why am I feeling less relaxed? maybe because I have things to get done... maybe just the lack of sunshine..."
Anxiety,f0k1nmc,t3_d51wyc,1568668111.0,"I didn't learn programming by studying, I learnt by diving in and making stuff for fun. Can you take a break from the studying and look for programming games, like Ruby Warrior or Human Resource Machine? or is there a game you like that has tools for making addons? or maybe you'd enjoy contest problems?

when it comes to actually studying... a lot of the time I'd stare at a goddamn blank wall until my brain was too bored to be anxious. it burns through a lot of time, but so did everything else."

Anxiety,f06j1p7,t3_d3ygk0,1568438907.0,"I'm actually *less* anxious on flights (maybe because I get to escape normal life for a bit?), but I've been on enough really long flights to be very prepared. Let's see if I can remember what I used to pack...

A kindle, of course. A battery pack for my phone, which has all my music. charging cables in case there's somewhere I can plug them in. Sometimes a paper book too. Enough food that I'll be okay if the airline meals are unusually awful (usually a couple of power bars and a bagel with cream cheese). Headphones that can be hidden by my hair. Water. neck pillow. sleeping mask (I won't sleep but at least I can rest my eyes). comfy slippers. socks and a warm sweater if I'm not wearing them, planes get *cold* sometimes. hard candies, even though I can pop my ears without them. paper and pencil and a few coloured pens. a pack of cards, just in case I'm sitting beside someone fun. laptop (which I don't actually own any more). plenty of kleenex. and for some reason my travel box has extra earplugs - I guess my old headphones didn't block enough noise?"
Anxiety,f06gm9i,t3_d3zh73,1568437416.0,"anxiety is really good at fucking up my muscles. usually in my neck and head, but it threw a tantrum a few weeks ago that made my *knees* hurt. :P

of course, knowing that the root cause is anxiety doesn't make the symptoms suck any less. I've found topical magnesium helps my muscles recover a little, and I've managed to retrain some of the muscles to be less susceptible (I adapted exercises meant for fixing a bladder issue, plus some of the mindfulness for pain management I'd been doing)."
Anxiety,f06fpb2,t3_d3um53,1568436816.0,"at one point it helped me to practice forgiving my past self for shit that happened long ago. I started with stuff where I could see that I'd just been a kid that couldn't have known any better, and slowly worked my way up to more recent things."
Anxiety,ez82n0w,t1_ez81h6a,1567732742.0,"can I ask which SSRI? I decided against escitalopram for other reasons, but saw reports of it doing that too. I'm thinking about trying mirtazapine, which sounds less likely to fuck with emotions (but I'm not sure if the sleepiness will turn out to be a good thing or bad thing, and I am so not looking forward to the weight gain...)"

Anxiety,ez81u91,t1_ez743yn,1567732215.0,"> The main reason for not immediately getting therapy is people knowing. 

that sounds like anxiety fucking with you. Unless you're still on your parents' insurance (and they actually pay attention to whatever info it sends them), nobody but you and your therapist needs to know, and part of your therapist's *job* is not judging you."
Anxiety,ez811hs,t3_czssd3,1567731704.0,"I've been researching anxiety meds today, and apparently mirtazapine might help with itching. I'm thinking of trying it myself in october..."
Anxiety,ez80gbf,t3_d096gc,1567731315.0,"well, the advantage of benzos is you only take them when you need them, ie a few minutes before the speech. the advantage of other meds is that in taking them all the time, they'll also help with other aspects of your anxiety. (once you find the right one for you, which could take months)

since the others might take a while to sort out, you could always get a few benzos to get you through the next few speeches and then start trying a daily medication (whether that's beta blockers, SSRIs, SNRIs or whatever) when you won't be speaking for a few weeks. just... ask your doctor before taking both at the same time, that could easily be dangerous."
Anxiety,ez1i140,t3_czssd3,1567648145.0,"I have an exfoliating shower cloth that's more scratchy than most; since I started using it my skin has been a fair bit better. I do my whole body every second day, especially arms and legs, in long moderately-slow strokes. I get a lot less ingrown hairs now too :)

I try not to scratch my head because it's gotten ocd enough to draw blood there sometimes. :/ I give it a good scratch (either with nails or shower comb) when I wash my hair twice a week and that's it.

I've also noticed that sometimes itchiness means there's a problem I'm not consciously aware of - maybe something I'm wearing is too tight, or I'm upset about something that happened, or I just need to pee."

DID,ete72iy,t1_etcd8dz,1562724588.0,"that makes sense, that you can only process so much trauma at once and need to slow things down so you can still function.

for me, it's always just been a matter of dropping into my mindscape and putting up walls/fences/etc. I.. don't really have a better explanation, I'm afraid :/ it's like trying to explain how to move my arm.

assuming you do get the hang of putting up walls, there's also the issue of remembering to bring them down again (or at least poke a little hole in them) when it's time for another round of trauma-processing. it can be reallly tempting to - oh. ohhhh. yeah maybe that's why we're such a mess the last few days, *someone* put up what were supposed to be temporary walls and then avoided doing any brain-maintenance for way too long (it's not fun, the avoidance is strong when I'm not around)) ... so, uh, yeah, maybe put something on the calendar to remind you to bring the walls back down later, we were really confused because we'd forgotten it happened and stuff was overflowing like the walls had become a dam, and pressure was building up...
