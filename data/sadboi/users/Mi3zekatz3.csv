queen,firoaqk,t1_fiqkznv,1582668188.0,The song belittles suicide. It makes to much light if it. I guess it‚Äôs fine for people who don‚Äôt struggle with it. For me it just isn‚Äôt enjoyable.
queen,fgoam1l,t3_ezeo03,1580964017.0,Don‚Äôt try suicide. For someone who has it can be offensive.
queen,fd8a7i6,t1_fd5ft3i,1578215799.0,He never was though
emetophobia,f7003m6,t1_f6z0nk1,1573322887.0,"I didn‚Äôt talk about taking meds every hour and of course you‚Äôll get sick every once in a while, but people behaving like OP posted are just rude and plain in the wrong. If they aren‚Äôt close friends and just acquaintances I‚Äôd drop them."
secularsobriety,f6t2v1e,t3_dsk8jr,1573143232.0,I think your own sobriety has to come first. I don‚Äôt go out of my way to ‚Äúrecruit‚Äù others. The decision to get sober has to come from the person with the problem anyway. If someone asks me about getting sober I will help them.
emetophobia,f6t0zne,t3_dsvvhk,1573142472.0,"Honestly I wouldn‚Äôt be friends with them anymore. 
What they did was just plain wrong. I‚Äôve encountered people like that before and told them how wrong it i and actually broke off contact. 
Wishing you well and I‚Äôm glad you have zofran."
queen,f6cxzhf,t1_f68i2oi,1572789619.0,"That‚Äôs the only Queen song I don‚Äôt like. Probably because I had 3 attempts and was rescued every time. 
I guess they wrote it as a suicide prevention song. It just doesn‚Äôt work for me. And I‚Äôm in treatment if anyone is wondering."
queen,f378ebd,t3_dfqrqr,1570722727.0,Crazy little thing on any station that doesn‚Äôt play Elvis. This might just be because I don‚Äôt like that kind of music and it still seems very in-Queen-like to me.
queen,f296ldx,t3_dcju9q,1570082939.0,It‚Äôs late is my absolute favorite so I‚Äôm super happy about these results.
4hourbodyslowcarb,f21hx51,t3_dbd01o,1569872432.0,There are high protein broths out there. Use the Keto ones. They have 10 g of protein. That‚Äôs the only way I get protein in the morning in me.
LifeProTips,f1vh7tq,t1_f1vbvt3,1569770849.0,"I told him not to do it in front of my son and also told my kid not to do it. That‚Äôs pretty much it. 
What I cannot understand is how a grown man doesn‚Äôt know that it‚Äôs disgusting."
LifeProTips,f1valps,t3_daslo1,1569768660.0,"So how would I tell my mid 40s friend that picking your nose in public is not a good idea and why the fuck doesn‚Äôt he know an better. This boggles my mind. I‚Äôm trying to teach my 8 year old not to do it. Just crazy. I told him that he shouldn‚Äôt do it around me since I don‚Äôt want to see it, that hasn‚Äôt stopped him from doing it in public though."
queen,f1v87cz,t1_f1tu9kd,1569767998.0,So maybe some kind of tradition or nostalgia thing then.... ?
4hourbodyslowcarb,f0njvdu,t1_f0nfdfu,1568771997.0,"I suffer from loss of appetite due to severe anxiety and depression, so I do intermittent fasting every day already. Loosing some weight that way is actually a nice side effect. I‚Äôm hoping to lose more with doing slow carb."
4hourbodyslowcarb,f0n4d3v,t1_f0mxnyk,1568760215.0,Yay
4hourbodyslowcarb,f0n4cit,t1_f0mdh6d,1568760204.0,"I‚Äôm super glad it‚Äôs not a problem. 
Today is actually my first day on this diet. I guess I haven‚Äôt read the whole book..."
4hourbodyslowcarb,f0n4a8y,t1_f0m9pig,1568760156.0,Awesome thank you. I shouldn‚Äôt eat sweet cheat day stuff in front my children.
queen,f01fqzp,t1_ezzlc2c,1568314158.0,Yeah I figured there was some kind of problem. Oh well we got it on NOTW.
startrek,ezyp4yn,t1_ezwc9i3,1568272132.0,It said Code not recognized ;(
queen,ezyo4zd,t3_d2iy98,1568271631.0,"I love the innuendo album except for I‚Äôm going slightly mad. Freddie‚Äôs voice sounds so weird to me
Edited for spelling"
queen,ezynnl6,t1_ezvzxbo,1568271393.0,I agree with all of these and would add It‚Äôs Late it was on one single as a B side. Not sure which one.
queen,ezyna0g,t1_ezxm09h,1568271187.0,It‚Äôs late is my favorite song!!!!
queen,ezyn8qm,t1_ezw0iit,1568271166.0,The cover is awesome however it sucks that you cannot see Roger on the front.
queen,ezymghx,t1_ezx2v2k,1568270745.0,I second this. Love the harmonies.
queen,ezym0qg,t1_ezy6mc1,1568270535.0,My favorite song on the album.
alcoholism,ezlbwaw,t1_ezkjs4b,1567974748.0,"There‚Äôs also LifeRing secular recovery and everyone actually has a chance to share and get feedback.  That‚Äôs one of the reasons why I really dislike AA. 
Go to lifering.org to check for meetings."
queen,ez8s5ns,t3_czjmok,1567756514.0,Do sad. Roger must have had a car phone. I cannot imagine how sad he must have been.
ptsd,eypi3ol,t1_eynz64v,1567300737.0,I just listened to that episode today. Sounded like an amazing idea.
ptsd,eyphxki,t3_cxv3am,1567300599.0,I‚Äôve written down my experience and I‚Äôm planning to make a book out of it. I have several traumas to deal with. I had my most recent therapist read it in front of me and he got very emotional and started to cry. That‚Äôs when I knew he was the therapist for me. I also read it when I‚Äôm giving a talk for abused women. Writing it all down has been really good for my healing process.
queen,eyeame2,t1_eydj9cd,1567031108.0,"I know not a question for me, but I love Get Down, Make Love. Mostly because of the drums and because of the awesome lyrics."
queen,eyeae9r,t1_ey8akk6,1567031016.0,I don‚Äôt like that one either because I attempted suicide 3 times and it almost sounds condescending to me. But then I also have a problem with doctors telling me that I have so much to live for. So far I‚Äôve never found another suicidal person who appreciated to hear that.
queen,ey4lipj,t1_ey3rhbc,1566796673.0,Awesome. Where those the maracas that took hours to steal according to Roger?
queen,exsiwnj,t3_ctd2r7,1566546054.0,I just love how the audience is going crazy.
queen,exqzu8f,t3_cu34y9,1566509393.0,I smell a troll
queen,exqzlbf,t3_cu2x09,1566509277.0,Love it. So cute looking
queen,exqzh8k,t3_cu33lm,1566509215.0,"I‚Äôm shocked by all those votes for ‚Äòin the laps of the gods‚Äô
I know everyone‚Äôs taste is different. ;)"
queen,exmdejy,t3_cthtl3,1566429375.0,I love this song. Thank you for giving us some background.
ptsd,ex4k0oq,t3_cqb6o4,1566006065.0,"I have the same problem. Lost 5 lb over the last few weeks even while in a partial hospitalization program. 
You are not alone ü§ó"
queen,ex0qdw1,t3_cqz6hi,1565919633.0,Not sure why you feel betrayed. Roger has stated several times that the song was about a roadie.  I guess nobody believed him which is really sad.
queen,ex0q2v3,t3_cqwl1u,1565919407.0,Are these John‚Äôs?
queen,ewpfrgk,t3_coj47e,1565640227.0,"This is my absolute favorite Queen song followed by Somebody to Love. 
I love how it changes throughout and is not repetitive. And of course I love Roger‚Äôs drumming ‚ù§Ô∏èüòçü•Å"
emetophobia,evyybwt,t3_clq3it,1564944420.0,Me every time especially when the ex husband just texts me that one of my boys is sick.... every single time I have to ask. He knows about my phobia. Still doesn‚Äôt get it.
queen,evsovq2,t3_ckxh2j,1564752696.0,"Just like everyone said because it‚Äôs different. I love under pressure and action this day. The rest is fine and I won‚Äôt skip those songs, however they‚Äôre not my favorites."
queen,evsol2c,t3_cku9tb,1564752476.0,I‚Äôm in
queen,evso6dt,t3_ckxfzd,1564752173.0,This picture is perfection
queen,evj85q6,t3_ck1e0a,1564557319.0,"This is amazing and I never comment on drawings. 
Definitely share the other band members when you draw them."
queen,evhgj5c,t1_evhfe43,1564526017.0,Okay checked it out. It‚Äôs really awesome thank you for recommending it. There‚Äôs no way to get a better audio quality though I guess...
queen,evhfe43,t1_evhd7f7,1564525508.0,Awesome I‚Äôll check it out
queen,evg8ym8,t1_evg7l8m,1564507348.0,I just noticed a lot of posts about OG Queen popping up. So hopefully this will keep up.
queen,evg86j8,t3_cjudu2,1564507055.0,Queen definitely isn‚Äôt the same without Freddie and John. However I think the combination of Q+AL is great and I believe Freddie would approve.
queen,evg7oow,t3_cjuf89,1564506865.0,It‚Äôs late because of the lyrics and the drums.
queen,evg6rda,t1_evg5sef,1564506529.0,I guess I misread your comment. And I absolutely understand that a lot of people feel that Queen basically ended when Freddie died. It‚Äôs just unrealistic to keep mostly everything past 1992 out.
queen,evg4moh,t3_cjre71,1564505714.0,"I love the album especially liar, keep yourself alive and modern times rock and roll. 
I think it‚Äôs one of the best debut albums ever. You can totally tell that they will be great."
queen,evg428z,t1_evfcgzg,1564505491.0,"I‚Äôm so tired of the talk that Adam sucks and that they should play with Marc. I mean... well you probably know Roger and Brian don‚Äôt want to play with Marc, which makes the discussion mute."
queen,evg33b2,t1_evf5y6d,1564505089.0,"Maybe it‚Äôs not ‚Äúreal‚Äù Queen to you, but to Roger and Brian it seems to be real. I think we should respect that. I fear this subreddit can not be customized to just a few people‚Äôs preferences."
queen,ev9zge2,t3_cixysj,1564335066.0,I went to see them in San Jose and there was no opening act. If you‚Äôre hugely pregnant and have trouble standing ask if you can enter through the disability line. ( not sure what it is properly called)
queen,ev9xr64,t3_ciy846,1564333877.0,"I don‚Äôt like the idea of a tribute band at all. No matter what band. I prefer the real deal, however some people just cannot afford a proper Queen concert, or they just aren‚Äôt playing close enough to them. going to a tribute concert is the closest they‚Äôll ever get to seeing Queen.
Actually my parents will see a Queen tribute band soon..."
queen,ev6dbbg,t1_ev35x8g,1564245403.0,"I‚Äôm not expecting them to do it. Just stating a preference. Also John was turned down by a lot and stated himself that he cannot sing. In a lot of interviews where Roger or Brian talk about harmonies they always talk about them having three voices (Freddie, Roger and Brian)
But I figured out through other sources that my opinion is not shared or not understood. Which is really weird. I have several friends who agree with me..."
Picard,ev02mbg,t3_chzz8d,1564130768.0,Nice breakdown. The presenter was SU PER AN NOYING lol
emetophobia,euz8qb3,t1_euyh07g,1564115211.0,Yes a lot of the people/professionals you actually have to explain emetophobia to are actual doctors or nurses. They know the words. I mean there a emi-bags everywhere.
stopdrinking,eupzy80,t1_euo69bz,1563967805.0,"I have over a year now with going to good AA meetings and never having a sponsor, reading the big book nor doing any steps. Whenever I mention that I don‚Äôt care for the steps I always get the impression that they think I‚Äôm not sober and their way is the ONLY way. I‚Äôm also going to LifeRing meetings, those are amazing. 
I guess I just take what I like and leave the rest. I don‚Äôt label myself as an alcoholic, I just say alcohol was my problem."
Picard,eufrgaw,t1_eudstu5,1563787891.0,First thing I thought was please no VOY cross over. I really never liked voyager at all. I think some janeway would be nice though.
seizures,eudnmrf,t3_cfzk10,1563722637.0,"I don‚Äôt know, but the same happens to me sometimes. I get the full seizure after effects though (headaches, sore muscles, sometimes I lose bladder control and bite my tongue). I guess those are tonic clonic in my case. 
You might have myoclonic twitches (not sure what they are called)"
queen,eub80nx,t1_eub62du,1563641816.0,I‚Äôm still wondering why and from where Roger stole them. Never found any explanation.
queen,eub7x2q,t1_eub6t4q,1563641749.0,Holy fuck that‚Äôs amazing

queen,euabxas,t3_cfgoh7,1563610376.0,Are those the ones for which it took hours for Roger to steal them?
queen,eu5cnrt,t1_ettrp13,1563474708.0,It started at 8:20 pm they always take their time. Amazing show.
queen,ettemgk,t3_cdcy7w,1563175942.0,I was there as well. It was awesome. So glad I got to see them. Doing alright sung by Roger was my favorite part.
emetophobia,etpv3cc,t3_ccvn5x,1563065405.0,"That‚Äôs insane. Why don‚Äôt people stay home or at least go to the bathroom and then go home. I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. 
I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be fine ü§ó"
westworld,etpuc31,t1_etppjea,1563064865.0,"Because season 1 was awesome and because of Aaron Paul. No offense taken, I think it‚Äôs a absolutely valid question and you might be right."
queen,et7d7j7,t1_et4mbcx,1562529229.0,Sadly I have to piggyback on this one. Had a failed attempt on the 4th of July.
queen,et7cx6w,t3_ca0gee,1562529083.0,The game tour. Backstage  waiting for Roger and testing if he‚Äôs really ‚Äòa good lay‚Äô
emetophobia,esm761v,t3_c8dy35,1562099602.0,"Is there any possibility that she‚Äôs pregnant?
Sending good thoughts your way. ü§ó"
emetophobia,eroy9jr,t3_c34zbs,1561092454.0,I‚Äôm the opposite. Can‚Äôt handle seeing or hearing it at all. It gives me nightmares and panic attacks
startrek,erawh3o,t1_er7vkgk,1560654646.0,I have in on my license frame ;)
Epilepsy,eqz31g8,t3_bzqlh0,1560393153.0,I‚Äôm utterly surprised that people still don‚Äôt understand our disease. No one ever questioned me taking medicine ever. I guess I‚Äôm the odd one out.
queen,eq1fj5v,t1_eq0zfmv,1559708135.0,I think they both look nice üòÉ
queen,eq0znts,t3_bwmygm,1559698042.0,"It‚Äôs hard to tell, but is this Freddie?"
queen,eq0zctg,t3_bwkm3r,1559697844.0,"I love it!!!! The second cursive especially the ‚ÄòI‚Äô reminds me of the way the queen members wrote. 
Why two different fonts?"
queen,epr3aa9,t3_bvjkwu,1559417510.0,What‚Äôs on the B site?
queen,eog77jf,t1_eofiq6c,1558552139.0,"Is there evidence for this claim. I know where he got it from, but that doesn‚Äôt mean he swiped it from Brian. It was outside of the theater where the we will rock you musical was playing. I don‚Äôt see a connection with the ownership."
queen,eofjeh2,t1_eoefuvf,1558535990.0,My bad. Didn‚Äôt realize that. Thank you for pointing this out.
queen,eody59t,t3_br7ulm,1558483758.0,"I think your rankings are very interesting. 
I love every single live album before the studio albums. I don‚Äôt really have an order. Probably a day at the races after all the live ones because I love somebody to love ;)"

queen,eocok8m,t3_brc62d,1558461406.0,I knew but I cannot recall what was said. I believe it was a homophobic slur.
