nintendoswitchlite,fqrpk0r,t3_ghikhq,1589589182.0,"I'd recommend the 8Bit Do Sn30 Pro, it's essentially a SNES controller with two joysticks added on. Or you could get the plus version for a better grip."
nintendoswitchlite,fqrgqf0,t3_gkh2cm,1589584023.0,Such a great game ! I sadly never experienced it as a kid but now that I have a switch I'm glad I'm able to experience nes and snes games for free

Minecraft,fn1uy6e,t1_fn1ssyw,1586570718.0,No problem. Oh I was looking up if my copy world would update alongside my main one or if I'd have to make a new copy every time I left the game
Minecraft,fn1qc2c,t3_e92qsj,1586567658.0,"Click on the little pencil symbol and go down to the bottom of the game settings. There should be a button called ""copy""."

Bikeporn,fmy77oq,t3_fxnih4,1586479612.0,That stem is looooong
Sneakers,fmy53a9,t1_fmy4y22,1586478302.0,Awh man I'm sorry to hear that :(
Sneakers,fmy4puw,t3_fxsjv5,1586478075.0,"I got them in a shop called Primark. Not sure what countries it's in outside of England and Ireland. Sorry that I haven't got more info than that :/ 

I'm not sure if you can buy them online but if you search ""lotto X Primark"" on Google you might be able to find them? Again sorry for the lack of info"
Sneakers,fmy4h8t,t1_fmy28fl,1586477929.0,"I think they're worth it yeah. I mean I'm a bit biased I'm a fanboy for sure hahaha. 
But yeah like they're a bit firmer in the heel due to the air unit, which of course isn't and soft as the foam in the toe, but in my opinion not to the point of discomfort. 
Honestly I'd say hold off if you're hesitant, just try them on in a store (when it's safe to do so of course , after everything goes back to normal.)"
ipod,fmxq3pg,t1_fmxpork,1586469694.0,"Oh yeah? I'll have to look into that, I'm only starting to learn about older iPods :)"

Sneakers,fmx8xw4,t1_fmx8rg8,1586460617.0,No problem!
Sneakers,fmx8lcz,t1_fmx85i0,1586460436.0,"I'm not sure, I've never tried 270s, but I'd imagine it's similar due to the similar midsole. But as far as I know the foam on the 2090s is softer"
Sneakers,fmx7unx,t1_fmx746m,1586460051.0,"Aw man I didn't even notice that haha. And yeah the loops are weird but idk I kinda like it. Even so, they're worth it for me for the comfort"
Sneakers,fmwvczy,t1_fmwuphp,1586453695.0,"The outer layer is definitely the same material as the React Elements, or at least very similar. 
But the material underneath is soft and super stretchy. 
Yeah like you could wear black socks and it would probably look okay, there is some black on this colorway but I personally prefer white socks."
Sneakers,fmwucqe,t1_fmwu75d,1586453185.0,That does sound like a good colourway!
Sneakers,fmwu25m,t1_fmws6ux,1586453039.0,"They're a brand called lotto. They're just cheap trackies. If you look up ""Primark X lotto"" you should find them. Sorry I can't be of more help I haven't personally seen them online"
Sneakers,fmwtu1q,t1_fmwphze,1586452925.0,They are super comfy! Idk if you've already seen [this](https://sneakerbardetroit.com/tag/nike-air-max-2090/) but thought it might be of interest
Sneakers,fmwtqfo,t1_fmwp1ns,1586452874.0,I wouldn't rock it myself but the colour won't affect the shoes because there's another layer under the upper so you don't see your socks through the shoe
Sneakers,fmwl5lk,t1_fmwjfbc,1586448542.0,For me it fits true to size
Sneakers,fmwl3pi,t1_fmwi728,1586448515.0,Yeah I can see that
Sneakers,fmwi2zy,t1_fmwhfuw,1586446975.0,Yeah the sole really gives me 270 vibes
Sneakers,fmwfsmb,t1_fmwfmcb,1586445802.0,Yeah I doubt mine will stay this clean for long. But hey I'm a believer in wearing my shoes not babying them so it won't bother me
Sneakers,fmwfm7a,t1_fmwfc5m,1586445709.0,"I'm surprised how comfy they are too. It feels like the sole is made from react, but it was never advertised as such so I'm not sure"
Sneakers,fmwfjel,t1_fmweg31,1586445670.0,I'm not a huge fan of shorts but tbh I'd say they'd go well with them yeah
Sneakers,fmwfgcr,t1_fmwbvqn,1586445626.0,Yeah they seem to be pretty different. I love how they payed homage to the OG 90's bit with a modern twist
Sneakers,fmwfbvc,t1_fmw6l6v,1586445563.0,They'll be worth the wait for sure
Sneakers,fmwf9c0,t1_fmw79xi,1586445527.0,They look even better in person trust me

redditmobile,fms1aoa,t1_fmrzrwu,1586343135.0,I'll agree there's plenty of issues on the android version don't get me wrong. I just don't think you should say that the iPhone version is inherently better because you personally are having a good experience with it.
redditmobile,fmrzcm5,t1_fmrz4hx,1586341094.0,"Type ""iPhone"" into the search bar of this sub and I think you'll find many people also experience issues with the iPhone version"

xbiking,fm2qwir,t3_fsenww,1585703345.0,What kind of bike was it originally because it looks like an awesome mix of a 90s mountain bike and a road bike

If I was you I'd just go for it (assuming you have a way to ensure the frame isn't too fucked lol)"
cycling,flvcvn0,t3_frdold,1585521156.0,"Yeah definitely some kind of old road bike, I reckon it was a ten speed, as they typically have two chain rings on the front. Most likely a sell frame too, which is definitely a plus in my opinion. Are you looking to buy it?"
