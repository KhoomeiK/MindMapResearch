lonely,fjjm7mq,t3_fdsm8h,1583403054.0,"Happy birthday! I turn 21 in a few months too. I don't expect to celebrate it as I recently lost / had to cut off a handful of friends for various reasons. But I think instead of focusing on the day itself, I'm going to think about it like ""hey, I made it this far despite not expecting to, I can keep going."" Cherish your dog, my dog and cat being me so much happiness so I can only imagine the bond you have with yours :)"

bipolar2,evm5dy5,t3_ckbd33,1564603502.0,"Hyper sexuality can be rather shitty to deal with. You also seem pretty manic/hypomanic in general. If you are able to make an appointment with your therapist I reccomend you do so. Your boyfriend can't help that he has a lower sex drive than you, each person is different and it's not really a ""men are this way, women are that way"" kinda thing."

brakebills,evae1px,t3_cj0tkj,1564345409.0,"In the very first episode, where it showed that Quentin had been in a mental health clinic, I knew this was going to be something different. I started watching the show a few months after I had been in one myself, and since then it and the books have been so helpful in getting me through some really tough few years of ups and downs. I'm now 20, and when I was deciding on my 2nd tattoo last year, I knew I had to get something related to the magicians. After some consulting with the artist, we decided on the brakebills logo with some added flair."
