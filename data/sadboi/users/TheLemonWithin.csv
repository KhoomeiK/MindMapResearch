depression,fp0xtu7,t3_gak2bg,1588219376.0,"Wow man, the things you listed that you've done while trying to get out of your comfort zone

You should be proud!  Honestly I feel similar with anxiety of being around people and being very insecure, and I was never able to push myself to do even one thing like you've done! You know you're capable of doing it, which is a good thing 

I think you can slowly just start being more honest with people, especially things where they would have no right to judge you like if you are wealthy or not. Dont let it all out at once of course, but just whenever theres a relevant conversation you can throw in some of your own honest experiences 

People can sometimes tell when someone isnt very genuine, and maybe people have felt that you were a closed book so they werent really sure how to properly interact with you. I think as you become more open and relaxed, you'll find your flow of how to express yourself to people and you will slowly realize theres never a need to worry about what people might think of you

You got this man! Baby steps! Even the smallest amount of progress is still progress"

I wish so bad that I could go back to when times were good 
It really kills me knowing that those times were likely the last times in my life that I would ever feel happy, and I had no idea how bad it could get after that 

Hang in there man"

selfhelp,fag6axi,t3_e929z6,1576041540.0,"It definitely sounds like anxiety/stress . I have such a similar situation and barely get sleep cause I cant silence my thoughts 
Im currently working through this too, but today I decided to really try to actively make a change and go to the gym starting tomorrow,  I'm also gonna try and see how meditation works for me, and even just focused breathing techniques while going to sleep 

The main challenge is dealing with your stressors head on. You can try making a list of all things that you may be currently worrying and stressing about (this list can be surprisingly difficult to make once you actually try and focus on stressors in your life)
But once you have an idea of all problems that could be making you anxious, you can see which ones can possibly be solved, and which ones you cant do anything about. Then you can have an idea of what you should try and change 

These are just a few things I'm trying to add to my life now too cause I can feel myself almost losing control 

I wish you strength man! You're not alone in this"

depression,f9fafnt,t1_f9f93vb,1575264297.0,"Yea man, I get it

Honestly the kicker for me was the length of time i was in school for ((after 4 years in college I started seeing my friends graduated and it made me miserable)). During the early years there was always *that point* in the semester where I just stopped caring for some reason, and that would cause my schoolwork to suffer miserably. Eventually, during like the 5th and 6th year, I was able to muster up even the slightest bit of motivation to push me through a semester where I was taking 5 classes. I think the feeling of having been in school for so long was keeping me going. I was so numb inside from all the work, but the accumulated feelings of failure from the past years kept me, for the most part, on track with my work. 

An, almost funny, feeling through school that oddly helped me was thinking about how, since my main stress was school, I wondered what it would be like to not have to stress about school, ""I wonder what other stress will burden me once I get rid of this school stress"", and somehow that feeling helped even though I was pretty much looking forward to my next stressor lmao. But oddly that was also a form of motivation cause I was genuinely curious if things would feel better after graduating, which i would never know unless i graduated. And that curiosity helped to keep me a bit more focused

And honestly, being stressed/depressed with a bachelors degree is a lot better than being stressed/depressed without one. The idea that I have options and credentials to make a living is pretty helpful to me, even if the stress/depression hasnt really gone away"

depression,f9f6smx,t3_e4o2ty,1575261107.0,"Based on how you wrote about your friend, I feel as though I am in a similar situation as them with just wanting to be alone

Maybe my perspective can help, hopefully

But honestly, right now I have isolated myself from literally EVERYONE in my life, because I dont fully understand what I'm feeling

But it doesnt mean I have stopped caring about them. I mean, in a way, i am at a point where i dont exactly feel any ""feeling"" towards anyone anymore (hopefully this is temporary), but i still know who was important to me before I started feeling this way, and i acknowledge it and still make sure that i will be there for them if ever needed.

For some reason though I dont want contact with anyone, my friends are constantly messaging me and I ignore them, I've even set their notifications to be silent on my phone so I dont know when they message me. But this has nothing to do with them, I havent forgotten them, but the way I am feeling has caused me to just not want to have contact with ANYONE at all, and I have no idea why. 

Honestly, you cant force your friend to feel better and you cant force them to contact you.... based on how I currently am, I get more annoyed than anything when they contact me because they havent taken the hint of me not answering
 ((I dont want to have to explicit say that I need space, cause that almost sounds temporary when honestly I'm not sure how long I will need to myself, so I really just want them to be able to accept that not getting an answer from me means they dont have to keep messaging me))...

 to me, I want them to just understand that if I dont answer then they can stop messaging me. I know that they care, but I feel more forced that anything when I am bombarded with messages that I dont have the energy to respond to.

I'm currently in a situation with friends, that I know care about me, but arent really allowing me any alone time and it just builds a bit of resentment towards them...


Anyways, what I'm saying is, give your friend the space they ask for. Honestly, it may be a long time, I've been needing this space for so long now, but if you were truly that close, they will come back to you for the comfort you can provide when they need it"
helpme,f9f5moz,t3_e4ocxo,1575260199.0,"I'm sorry to hear this man.


How old are you though? Honestly the first thought I had was that you need to get out of that house If you are close enough to being 18 years old., Although it's not physically abusive (based on what you posted) it's still a mental abuse that your mom is causing you. If your at least 16 (I think that's the minimum working age?) You should try and get a job. Anything, dishwashing, water, etc.  Once you can start saving up money you will be continually closer to getting another place to live, maybe with roommates to lessen the costs. Idk if that may be a drastic option, but it's completely unfair how you are being treated and unless talking to your mom about this might help, your main option should be focusing on taking things into your own hands. Then once you are old enough to move out you will hopefully have a nice savings account (supposedly 6 times the rent you expect to pay) and can go live on your own. 

Other option can be to try talking to your mom about all of this, but I'm unsure if you have already tried this.

I also recommend maybe try talking to a counselor at your school and getting advice from their point of view, I believe they have training for situations in a similar air as this one... Actually I definitely recommend this option fully. You need more opinions and to understand your options. 

I acknowledge your pain though man, and I am really rooting for you"
helpme,f9f4uf0,t3_e4sgpd,1575259591.0,"I'm not exactly sure what a ""weird"" walk would look like, and  Its not something I've heard often so I dont really have advice, but I do think that if you believe you would like a new way of walking, you can always practice a more relaxed kind of walk. Like when you walk anywhere pay attention to how you are walking, it may be annoying at first having to be so aware of it so that you can change it, but once you are used to practicing and walking in a new way, it will soon become a habit and you will make it your natural way of walking"
