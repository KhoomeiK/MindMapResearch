Anxiety,ff7ekdl,t1_f27uvdw,1579647734.0,"As someone also on Clonazepam and Mirtazapine, I am happy to hear that you've had no issues. I have been too afraid to try supplementing with L-Theanine due to fear of an adverse reaction.


Hope things are going continuing to go well for you."
ITCareerQuestions,f2n579a,t3_ddt591,1570312302.0,I would say this sounds along the lines of a mix between Jr. SysAdmin/Jr. Network Engineer/IT Support Specialist.
ITCareerQuestions,f2dqvkg,t1_f2dnnvv,1570161811.0,"Side note: I'm not sure where my company would rank, but I'm guessing in the F1000 since it's yearly revenue is between 500m-1bn and I believe the lowest ranked company in the F500 had a yearly revenue of over 4 billion dollars."
ITCareerQuestions,f2dq2xi,t1_f2dnnvv,1570161132.0,"Wow, thank you so much for taking the time to write out that detailed explanation. I'm going to save that for reference for hopefully many years of appropriate salary negotiations. I actually do know the salary range for my ""pay grade"", which I believe follows that level system across the board. I started about 4 grand over the minimum of the range, but roughly 20 grand from the limit for my grade. I'm not sure if that ceiling adjusts for each promotion or if I'd have to have multiple promotions before it'd be a topic of increasing."
ITCareerQuestions,f2dkbwm,t1_f2djzl4,1570156521.0,"Your advice is very much appreciated, and I didn't mean to be potentially out of place for asking for those details. I was just curious if you were in a management role and/or security role so you were giving advice on how you'd determine the value of your team or potential hires."
ITCareerQuestions,f2djsfj,t1_f2djkcf,1570156107.0,"I also don't have any certifications at the moment, but do plan to go for some in the near future. My degree and passion for learning the security-side of IT outside of my old position is what allowed me to jump into my current role even though I probably never would have made it through the screening process if they didn't already know me."
ITCareerQuestions,f2djkcf,t1_f2djd7d,1570155929.0,"That's actually what some people from my old department said. They suggested just holding out for 3-5 years and then jump ship for a significant pay increase if I wasn't happy there come that time. Do you mind me asking your title, years of experience, and CoL level?"
ITCareerQuestions,f2djdgc,t1_f2dh5nf,1570155781.0,"Since I'm am inexperienced in the protocols and risks of applying for other jobs while currently employed, is it likely to be burned by my employer possibly being contacted to verify my employment history? I can see that also putting pressure on my current employer that I have other options that see my value as an employee, but also causing bad blood if I don't end up changing employers."
ITCareerQuestions,f2dj58v,t1_f2dgwth,1570155604.0,"Non-ironic oof that my salary is that of the range of what someone in Help Desk is expected to make. No disrespect to the Help Desk route. Title isn't full of air as I perform duties expected of a Security Analyst. I start my morning off checking our SIEM's alarms, determine what are false-positives and what aren't, manage our phishing tests and semi-annual security training for all employees, manage our VPN's for traveling/remote employees, perform packet captures for troubleshooting networking issues and that nothing is moving as cleartext or a weak encryption, verify that the different golden images for deployments are up-to-date and secure, patch vulnerabilities that come back from weekly external and internal scans, etc. More always seems to be dropped on my plate, which I plan on using as justification for a significant raise or promotion when my next annual review is performed. Most salary ranges for my job title in my area range from 50-65 grand for non-lead or senior analyst positions. I know I'm underpaid, but feel down the rabbit hole of being blinded by the opportunity of moving into this position and the solid benefits/usually decent work-life balance most of the year."
