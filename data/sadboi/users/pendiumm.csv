The same way a ceo makes a few hundred times more than his employees despite it physically being impossible for him to do that much more work. It’s more about power dynamics and being in the position to exploit labour of those under you. It’s more about putting effort into long term things that will make money businesses/ education. The problem is Some people will never be in the position to work hard in these areas for very obvious reasons."

I figured I should do the same. first time I did it I made like 100 bucks. Funny thing is me and him are the only ones in our area who do it. So I’ve literally had him message me to buy a phone from me not knowing it was the same guy from before. I’m not sure if your in Canada or the states, but the site kijiji is good for this. You will notice that there is actually a lot of people buying and reselling for higher. It’s hard to do it without a car but when I had my car I would message a bunch of people and chill at the train station and have hem meet me a a nearby rester-aunt. People flop a lot and it can be time consuming but if you have a free day on the weekend, buy like 3 or 4 phones for as low as possible and then don’t buy anymore until you can sell the batch. Keep track of your profits as well and if you must take a loss or break even after having a phone l for around 1 week. Take the loss and move on to another phone. Try to buy phones between one or two generations older than the current one as those are the easiest to sell. If a phone is too old, you can get it cheap but no one wants it, if it’s too new it’s too expensive to risk buying it used from someone. You have to find that sweet spot where people are willing to buy used but where you can also get deals while buying."
poverty,fhf5frz,t3_csg3qu,1581536600.0,I used to buy and resell iPhones for profits of 50-100 dollars. If you have a car it can be easy to swoop up cheap phones and resell for much much higher in different cities. I used to buy phones in the rich area (where people would sell for way less than the worth) I always try to talk to the person on the phone because older people tend to not know the value of the phones as much as young. Get them down as low as possible and don’t take the first offer you get from people.

While true, this is called a fallacy of relative deprevation, just because others have it worse it doesn't take anything away from the suffering. There is ALWAYS someone who has it worse so technically the only one who can complain or feel bad is the person with the worst life on earth, which is dumb.
