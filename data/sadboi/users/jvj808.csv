Admin was horrified and is dealing with it, thankfully."
AmItheAsshole,f2ygh35,t3_delta8,1570491053.0,"YTA, but let me explain. When I was an 18 year old girl in college, my dad pressured me to get a business degree. I didn't want to. I wanted an LA degree. I didnt have a full plan (tbh, a lot of freshmen change their mind anyways). Halfway through college, my dad didn't approve of my career and religious choices (I decided I didnt want the career he wanted for me and I became Catholic). He pulled all funding from my life; tuition, food, everything. I worked four jobs and maxed out my loans to graduate. 

I am now 23 with a LA degree in a career I never thought I'd be in making almost 50k. I figured it out. I made it work. 

But, my relationship with my dad will never be the same.  So please, think super carefully. While I understand, adult children are not entitled to a college fund, it sounds as if this was an expectation in your relationship. If supporting her education is a hardship, I understand (it wasn't for my parents). If it isn't, please consider if the relationship with your daughter is worth the cost."
