It's not offensive to think you're bigger than you actually are because of a mental illness. And what's wrong is to say ""instead of fat say unlovable."" 

No. I knew I was loved. I just thought I was so much bigger than I really was. And so do countless other people."

I wasn't on bc when I lost my virginity and he didn't realize the condom had ripped. It was a terrifying experience to get that text while I was at work, and I was terrified for a month. For that reason alone I'd hop on it. 

Not to mention all the other benefits that can come from it. Help with acne control, better and more stable periods. I wish I had gotten on bc for those reasons alone MUCH sooner"

relationship_advice,fqvble5,t1_fqv7l4p,1589673820.0,"It wasn't normal pre-Covid. Before he was talking to me all the time, and we were together most nights. It was like a switch flipped. When I call he either lets it ring and go to voicemail or he ends it before answering, and when I text, most of the time it stays delivered and sometimes it's opened. But he's sent me snapchat streaks after leaving a normal text (like a how was work kind of text) on open. Lately he's been better about talking to me, but I've still been left on read, and can't count on him to answer a call, even after telling me to call. 

I really am not asking for a lot. If he can't talk that day, all I want him to do is say so instead of just opening the texts and not responding all day. A long conversation once in awhile would be great, but I'm more than happy to settle for that at this point. 

Now I'm more angry at him then upset. I was upset a lot over it during the month of April, I was really hurt. Now I just feel like he may not know if he wants to actually fix this problem, and that he may just be talking now so I'll stop asking."

A simple ""brb I'm going on Xbox"" would be fine for me, and I wouldn't get upset at all. Even if we can't talk all day, I'd just like to know that. Thanks again"
Advice,fquvj1j,t1_fquusa1,1589665191.0,"I'm happy to answer these for you! 

1) we've had conversations as of why before. There's been a lot of different things said to me, busy with a game, sitting in the living room, sleeping, the latest was that now his cellphone gives him a headache. His shifts are still the same. I'd never be upset over work, and throughout I've tried not to nag or anything. I hate to be a pain in the ass after a long day lmao

2) It has been one of the best. And I do feel that it could just be my nervousness getting the best of me now, but some of my friends haven't been so sure about my nervousness being the problem, so it makes me question that logic as well. 

3) He has helped me a lot. It's been the first relationship I've been able to feel comfortable and secure in as a whole. 

Thank you for the advice!"

Advice,fm3hfw7,t1_fm3gsec,1585723645.0,"I am moving out soon, as a cousin and I decided we want to live together by May, and she won't have an extra key. Giving my parents one seemed like a good idea at the time for emergencies, such as a power outage (I have a gecko at home who I absolutely adore and baby the fuck out of, and winters in upstate ny can really suck; and leaving him while it snows or thunderstorms stresses me while I work). It seemed like a good idea because I worry about the safety of my animals, and my parents and little siblings all know my babies' needs if needed. But once I live with a roommate it won't be an issue, there would be no reason for anyone who isn't us to have keys. My cousin is very much on my side with this, and wouldn't tell my parents a thing I didn't want them knowing while we live together. 




I have started to do those things with the phone, as I don't feel the need to listen to it, and I am not going to give her some sort of explosive reaction. She always tries to get me to apologize after, and so will my dad, but I always refuse and will ignore them. 

Thank you for the advice btw!"

This month was terrible for my mental health before all this, but I just hit rock bottom over it thanks to being let go from work. 

Some people are lucky. Some people still can afford everything even without multiple jobs, I'm just not one of those people, and while it sucks, I just have to make sure I get through it anyway.
