loseit,fkegaad,t3_fi11bz,1584112574.0,"Hey lovely! I relate to this post so much, in my opinion I think you should aim to eat foods that fit within your caloric goal for your height and weight (I highly recommend professional advice because eating too less calories can seriously fuck you over). Try to implement the foods that you really enjoy where you can. Itâ€™s going to be a stressful next while due to this outbreak and I donâ€™t know about you but learning to unlearn the habit of comfort eating can be extremely difficult especially in stressful times like these. Making good habits isnâ€™t easy and itâ€™s really just trial and error. Maybe you can even do your own recipe exploring  instead of eating mamas goods itâ€™s always nice to branch out:) just remember calories in calories out itâ€™s helped me so much. Iâ€™m not a health professional and Iâ€™d never claim to be! The beauty of this site is that weâ€™re all able to offer our own opinions and advice, hopefully this helped even the slightest bit! You got this girl. Message me if you ever need to x"

CPTSD,fkb2ps0,t3_fhgino,1584024911.0,"I was recently diagnosed with cptsd which I was shocked and confused, I didnâ€™t really feel that I was valid to have it (I hope that makes sense). I hadnâ€™t really known a lot about what it what until last year when I started dating my now ex boyfriend, at that point I became almost completely absorbed in it and tried to understand him as best as I could and what having cptsd meant to him so that I could support him and comfort him to the best of my abilities. Other than that I donâ€™t have any other experiences with it. 

I grew up in a very disfunctional household and have had very traumatic things happen to me, which have left deep emotional/mental scars and have had a drastic impact on my everyday functioning. I have self harmed and been suicidal, and often thereâ€™s times were I disconnect and feel as if Iâ€™m not me, and Iâ€™m not here. I feel like Iâ€™m blabbering on.. Iâ€™m not the best when it comes to expressing how I feel lol. Iâ€™m taking it a day at a time though. This community is so helpful."
