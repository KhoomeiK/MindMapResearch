I'm so proud of you for making it this far. Keep going. Reach out to NA or online communities for some support. If you've been taking drugs everyday for a very prolonged time you need to do the withdrawal safely or you can have more adverse effects.  Doctor would be your best bet but there are still people who can help if you cant afford one. Praying for you.

Or even taking time off for sick leave maybe use sick ei for a bit? Working yourself to death is going to make the pain worse and there is only so much that pain meds can do for longterm pain. Surgery can sometimes help but the waitlists in Canada are ridiculous. Plus sometimes you end up in more pain after the surgery. Lifestyle adjustments are something you should start considering if this has been happening for a while. Hope you figure this out.

Can even put the oil in your bath but be careful because the tub gets slippery.

 I also have prescription creams for a weird rash I get (pityriasis rosea). 

I use one of those super soft blankets when I get really itchy and when I can't handle anything touching me. 

A cool shower helps when you're on fire from the itchiness. 

Sometimes after using cream and the oil I like to lie in front of a fan and ""dry off"". 

Can also try an antihistamine!

ETA - if you're itchy due to dry skin you can also invest in a humidifier to help get rid of some of the dryness in the air for this time of year. A cream that drs often prescribed at my hospital was aveeno products. I have one for eczema that has menthol in it and that cools down the itching as well!"

Duloxetine bupropion, abilify are all meds I took but abilify ended up being too expensive w no insurance. I did find the abilify helped with my suicidal thoughts though. Maybe talk about adding clonazepam or something for the stress/anxiety you are under. I found that the most beneficial thing I could being to a psychiatrist was symptoms more than just how I was feeling. As meds in this field are often helpful with certain symptoms. Bupropion gives you more energy in the day time if you take it in the morning, duloxetine helps w overall depressive symptoms and pain if you have fibromyalgia like me. Abilify helps with suicidal thoughts and some of the more obscure symptoms. Talk to a pharmacist about all the medications you are on and the excessive suicidal thoughts you are having because sometimes these medications interact w each other making your symptoms worse. Esp w another SSRI in the mix. You'd be surprised how medication can interact and make those symptoms worse. Plus they can see what helped and what didn't in your file and maybe recommend different or alternative medications. I wouldn't stop them all at once though."
