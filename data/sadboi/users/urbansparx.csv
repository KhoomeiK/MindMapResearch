It wasn't even a year ago my psych first told me that how I was treated by my family wasn't my fault and it was like a bomb went off in my chest. Years of trying to be better, do better, almost begging for them to accept me and love me as their daughter/sibling/grandchild. Thinking maybe theyre right and I dont have Bipolar 1, I'm just lazy etc. Little things started to come to my attention, hugs... how weird are hugs? They're nice of course but they felt strange at the same time. Dawned on me I can't remember ever being hugged by anyone, they just weren't huggers? I dunno.
