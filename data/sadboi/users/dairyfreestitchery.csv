streetlightmanifesto,fozvnhp,t3_gai2hh,1588197673.0,"I have a theory that it's about a narrator talking about his mental illness. The fact that we are given it, or born with it, and not wanting it. Even though you were given this mental illness you can still push through it and treat it like a positive instead of a negative. That you are stronger because you work so hard through it.
