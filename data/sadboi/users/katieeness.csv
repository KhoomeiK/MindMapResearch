ENFP,fmzjs4q,t3_fy5ioc,1586522525.0,"I started my associates degree when I was in high school and I was determined to become a doctor, you know because that‚Äôs the most badass title one could have (I thought at the time) and I would be able to finally feel like I accomplished something. There was one small problem with this plan: I literally could not pass intermediate algebra and had to take it 3 times in community college. Besides that, I was earning straight Cs. I thought about nursing and actually became a nursing assistant which I work as now, but that made me realize I didn‚Äôt want to be a nurse at all. Eventually I transferred to university & flunked out in 2 quarters. 

It was very difficult for me to accept that maybe this career just was not for me. I don‚Äôt know what emotional attachment I had to the title of being a doctor but I certainly thought it would magically make me feel good and important. Long story short, I knew from being a CNA that healthcare and helping others was definitely the right field because I love it and I excel at it. I ended up going on some ride alongs with my dad at his fire station. Because I‚Äôm literally just like my dad it‚Äôs no surprise that I absolutely fell in love with it. 

It‚Äôs something new all the time, never boring, unconventional schedule, exhausting, and great money & benefits. It would allow me to travel and also pursue a healthcare career. It‚Äôs an adrenaline job and you never know what a day holds. It involves quick decision making & you are constantly under pressure. For my ENFP mind these things are absolutely exhilarating and fulfilling, I‚Äôm currently working through EMT school and I love it. Not to mention I‚Äôve done really well as far as grades. It‚Äôs the first schooling I‚Äôve actually done well in!

I think life has a way of leading us to exactly where we are supposed to be if we let go of our pre conceived ideas of what we ‚Äúshould‚Äù do. It‚Äôs hard to consider finances but I think there is a way here for you to use engineering creatively and make it a fulfilling career. It may take a couple tries and a couple failures and some bumps but if you hold things with open hands and just go for it I think you‚Äôll be able to find something decently fulfilling. Sorry this was so long! Wishing you the best :)"

Ex: being overweight is holding me back the most because of xyz reason. 

This is a big goal and there are many moving parts. But you can start by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to not drink any soda this week, and try to go for a walk every day‚Äù. Then slowly build up your habits week by week. Focus on one thing at a time and even one day at a time. 

I would say sometimes the cold turkey all or nothing drastic approach works. It depends on your personality type and your goals. But I find it super easy to burn out with that approach and end up worse off than I was before. That approach has worked for me only with school. I used to be a c student and nearly failed everything. I‚Äôm now taking my EMT course and getting As simply because I decided to put the time/work in and do a complete 180 with my study habits. 

Again it depends on your personality and goals. But just my 2 cents!"

ptsd,fjx2g9n,t3_ff8j3s,1583653678.0,"I can‚Äôt tell you that it goes away permanently, but I can tell you (as stupid and cliche as this may seem) time, practice and patience really do go a long way. I was in an emotionally/physically abusive relationship 3 years ago and I was raped 2x by this person. Because of the nature of the relationship and abuse I have pretty bad PTSD and trauma.

I want to say I can‚Äôt imagine what you have gone through and my heart truly goes out to you <3 our experiences may be different but maybe it can help in some way. A lot of my ptsd manifests as ruminating thoughts and thought loops that I can‚Äôt get out of, as in images, experiences, memories on a constant loop in my mind for hours. I could be in the dark doing nothing but thinking these thoughts for hours on end. Every day. Especially the very traumatic memories. It has caused extreme difficulty in my relationships, and forget even thinking about talking to the opposite sex. I avoided male cashiers or clerks for a long time because even interacting with them on that small of a level gave me extreme anxiety. Forget going to a guy‚Äôs house, I would go into full blown panic mode if we were alone. Certain places I couldn‚Äôt go or drive past, certain songs I would have to avoid, they would all send me into panic. There were lots of symptoms but that names a few. 

I‚Äôve been in trauma centered therapy for about a year and almost a half. I did a fair amount of EMDR, hypnosis and CBT. I can say with confidence where I am now is 10000000% further than where I was then. Instead of ruminating every day, I ruminate maybe once a month or once every two months. I can talk to a man and I can even have friendships with men. I can even go on dates without going into a panic attack (although romantic relationships still give me extreme anxiety we are getting there). I too still have nightmares about my abuser and they can be very painful and anxiety inducing. 

I don‚Äôt know if PTSD ever does truly go away. But was once a big, scary, thorny forest slowly gets a little more lit up and a little more green: instead of being lost in it you learn to find a path through it and you learn the tools to keep the dangers out of your way. What‚Äôs important is being able to open your toolbox whenever you see those dangers or triggers come up, and never being afraid to start over day by day if you have to. Deep wounds take so long to heal, they may not ever heal to be exactly as they were before, but that‚Äôs not the goal. It‚Äôs not to get back to who you were before things happened, it‚Äôs to find the strong, immensely courageous you underneath all the heartache and pain. I‚Äôm wishing you the best of luck and lots of love."

NewToEMS,fj987y8,t1_fj97x55,1583136379.0,Lmao I may as well tattoo it on my forehead thank you so much for the tips :) we aren‚Äôt in the trauma section until April but it will give me an edge to start looking over that stuff early
NewToEMS,fj97wvf,t1_fj96933,1583135979.0,Just under 3 months. I think the hardest material is in the first few weeks. It‚Äôs just a lot of information to retain at once. Anatomy and phys is difficult already but it‚Äôs just memorization you are right. Thank you so much for the reply
NewToEMS,fj97uvc,t1_fj97c17,1583135907.0,"Thank you!!! My class is just under 3 months, in Washington state the curriculum is very high level I feel like maybe more than other states just because ems is so experimental here but I could also be wrong. The biggest problem is I have to maintain an exam average to stay enrolled in the class and I struggle with exams. I have been studying every spare minute of every day pretty much aside from work and obligations. And I still feel behind at times. I think when we get to more of the skills portion it will be better since I am much better learning with hands on skills than bookwork and lecture. I will get my practical sheets going thank you so much for your help"

ENFP,fj95u6e,t3_fbah5f,1583133394.0,I feel this way about feelings in general. I can be myself and normal with a dude but once I start feeling something higher or feel attracted I start acting like a fool...lol it‚Äôs literally so weird. I feel this!
