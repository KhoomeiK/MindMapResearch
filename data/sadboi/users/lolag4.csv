SuicideWatch,fkhf69p,t3_fic73e,1584197326.0,So true
BDSMAdvice,f69uga5,t1_f66g39k,1572747613.0,"Yeah I tried it once when I was too frustrated (not something I'm proud of and I apologized and got punished), and it felt so aweful. It was terrible experience to intentionally break rules and I felt guilty and empty. Not enjoyable at all. I'm sure a lot of peer subs can relate."
BDSMAdvice,f6689cu,t1_f63ua4g,1572708544.0,Thank you for your input! You are right to redefine our dynamic is probably what i really need. It started way better than this. At one point he started to emphasize I'm only a slave and that was when how everything started to change: none of my needs matters etc. Thanks again
