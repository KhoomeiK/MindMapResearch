TheStrokes,fn5tof0,t3_fzjv5j,1586675514.0,"The answer is nothing, no band is overly special in that regard, it’s all just subjective creativity. Personally, I don’t really listen to music for the lyrics, I like melody, guitars, vocals, drums, bass, etc but I think lyrically the centrepiece of TNA is “At the Door”. To be fair, I’ve listened to a lot of music over the years and a lot of the time lyrics don’t have to make sense, as long as it has meaning to the singer, because the vocalist will likely be using metaphors and cryptic rhyming if needed, it doesn’t have to be Nick Drake or Bob Dylan level, and even their songs were just fun and creative in some sense. There are groups that are very lyrics focussed and that’s fine, but if I don’t enjoy the music then it won’t grab my attention. In the end, lyrically, you’ll listen to what makes sense to you as an individual, but a lot of bands write lyrics for the fun of the songwriting process coming together. So hence, an example, The Beatles - “I am the Walrus” and Talking Heads wish Stop Making Sense proves that sometimes we overthink the importance of lyrical meaning. Doesn’t mean you can’t write cleverly or write compelling music, but sometimes it’s a bit overstated in terms of overall music history. So, with Velvet Underground and Nico, the lyrics are really simple, take “ Sunday Morning”, all very simple, but has this beauty of feeling because the music compliments the lyrics so nicely, but it’s not something the everyday person couldn’t easily write if they put their minds to it and focussed. The more important process seems to be the blending of the lyrics and the music."

news,fn1gqeu,t3_fygekv,1586561662.0,"What could help a lot is a shift in the tone of the mainstream to help balance the mood of people. During the Second World War the radio and tv would play a lot of comedy and music and upbeat content to counter the way people were feeling in reality, this also occurred during the first gulf war. So a really good modern example of this would be the 1990s, yes we now have YouTube and Netflix, but in the 90s, mainstream culture was basically, everyday people, classy, upbeat dance music, classy and fun rap, guitars and bands were a big deal, which the everyday person could relate to, movie culture was great comedies and memorable original blockbusters, think, Jurassic Park, The Mask, Matrix and the list goes on and on...

Now if you look at current culture, it’s low brow pop music, crossover genres, which is fine, but a lot of it’s narcissistic. Housing is super expensive in every capital city, a cycle of fear based information, and media content is basically, “choose your favourite”, so a lot of people don’t relate as much, because of “ so much choice”. Which is also ok, but it tends to divide people’s opinion a lot more and that means more disagreements, more arguments. Which doesn’t help in times of a quarantine. So the only way to deal with it is to be sort of an oracle or a peacemaker, because it’s fair to say that arguments or arrogance just doesn’t get people anywhere, it increases resentment and there are far more diplomatic and nicer ways to get your point across, hopefully people stay thoughtful and empathetic in the whirlwind of these current times. Maybe slow down, think of how you can help others and maybe brighten up your own day or someone else’s."

I’m not saying it’s perfect, what is? But you might be right, I’m just saying that I didn’t have that many issues with the mix of this album after 5 or so spins so far. Also remember CD, digital and vinyl often sound different in terms of warmth. There is even an audio tape reel release of this album, so there is plenty to check out as well!

In terms of rickwalled, I think it’s tightly mixed the way they wanted the songs to sound. Again I need to listen closer, but I certainly didn’t stop the album at any point with complaints or worries about the mix.

It’s still very well balanced and mixed in my opinion and it’s a big sound nonetheless. I’m having no issues with the left or right channels either, even with a slight emphasis on Jules great vocals at the front and why not? It takes nothing away from the music, but again, my own opinion. I hear Nick and Albert clearly in both channels and the drums sorta fly in and out giving a 3D effect sometimes.

Lift - Minidiscs 
here: https://youtu.be/IDGdGdtD7To

True Love Waits (OKC session) - https://youtu.be/MuvMk_Ddljo

Here is my summary of my iPod minidiscs playlist:


The song titles are just words used in the lyrics, I have no idea if Ashes or Emperor’s New Clothes are the names of the songs.

Big Ideas (Don’t get any) - studio version, with some great backing vocals in the second half. Probably didn’t fit on OKC or the Airbag EP, but again, nude suits In Rainbows, but this is really top notch! The second half of this version reminds me of street spirit.

Last Flowers - long early version, lyrics a bit different, very Polyethylene but so good it’s a shame it wasn’t released. It would fit on the Airbag EP. An absolute gem. Make no mistake, this is a fully developed band version.

Palo Alto - , acoustic, lovely version, so dreamy. There is also a second band version, sounds nice.

Emporer’s New Clothes - unreleased but a good song, studio version. It would fit the airbag EP.

At the Station! - Really nice song, unfinished but very cool, going somewhere special.

True Love Waits - Dreamy, nice drums, synths, rolling synths, clearly a special studio recording, but probably didn’t fit on the album or the EP. 

Motion Picture Soundtrack - sorta Portisheady, nice strings, lovely version. A bit slower.

Lift - think the pinkpop version but a studio recording with an awesome intro that seems to be 
sampling a radio being tuned and a music box with keys, heavy guitars, huge strings, brilliant! Must have been hard to leave this one alone.

Customer Hotline - Unreleased, very cool acoustic song!

Funky Instrumental - Think Talk Show Host funky guitars, very catchy and very rock n roll!

Electioneering - a soundboard live version, but it sounds good.

Ashes - the piano is gorgeous, almost sounds like the early burn the witch teases from 2008, incredible song.

Only reason I mention all this is because I think the really keen fans of the band should probably be aware."

radiohead,fhh6ct2,t3_f3582c,1581595408.0,"It’s a classic album! That’s never changed, it’s just that each album after was highly regarded so people tended to vote “in the moment” of the current era! Under the guise of each new album has to be more experimental and progressive which whilst maybe true in terms of style, it doesn’t mean the root songs themselves are better at all. For instance an example would be, the songs on The Bends does have better songs than the songs on King of Limbs and arguably Hail to the Thief overall. It’s all subjective of course, because, yes, Codex is great and Hail has gems! but I think nice dream is a much better song than the gloaming. So it’s always an interesting subject to bring up with fans. But at the end of the day, people should like want they like and let it be, but that’s my take on it.

I think The Bends is on par with In Rainbows, OKC is on par with Kid A, but how you genuinely distinguish what is actually best, etc. it’s too hard. I just don’t personally gel with the idea that new means it’s default better, because it’s new and maybe used more eclectic recording style. 

If The Bends was recorded with the instrumentation and production from Amnesiac, it would be a better album than Amnesiac, because the songs themselves are stronger and more thought out arrangements. But again, my opinion. It’s why I think they were crazy to leave “Cuttooth” off the official LP."
