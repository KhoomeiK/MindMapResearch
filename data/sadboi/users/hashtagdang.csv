I know it’s going to be hard to not talk to other people but at least I can talk to new people other than my mom."

design_critiques,fnmr8dd,t3_g2k1sz,1587076624.0,It looks great! I'm surprised you are not a designer by now. It reminds me a lot of notion and slack logo. I would suggest adding a placeholder in your text boxes under Log in and Request Access.

design_critiques,fn3iu6f,t3_fz82pb,1586621613.0,"Hi there! I think the concept and overall design is great - I just have a few concerns:

\- ""Activities and things to do"" doesn't sound attractive. It seems like an afterthought - I think you can do a more enticing title.

\- You can use some color for header of ""Why choose us"" and ""How it works"" - everything is grey and I can only distinguish what's important based solely on size of the font

\- I'm not too sure why you would suddenly include a new font within your categories. It kinda threw me off because there are no indication of the same font previously

\- In the navigation, you highlighted ""add a new listing"" which I assume this is for the host and yet the rest of the page is targeted to a ""customer"" I think you either highlight Sign up for customer or Add a New listing with host details underneath

\- also for copy ""customer"" seems a little .. businessy. It would be fine if it was a B2B site but this is a B2C site. I'm sure there is friendlier language to address your user

Hope that helps!"

offmychest,ffrts2h,t3_euup3o,1580165653.0,"Wow. I was going rant about the same thing - I too am also struggling with getting back to the workforce. 

I have an almost three-year resume gap because I was struggling with major depression. While I tried to cover up with some volunteering and online courses, I didn't finish half of them because my depression told me that it is all hopeless. Why bother when I am so stupid, dumb, and worthless? It wasn't worth the effort. On top of that, I relied financially on my parents and stayed in my college town for years. Since I lived close to a huge tech metropolitan, the cost of living skyrocketed. It was the worse feeling to see my college town getting gentrified at every moment while I rotted away. 

A few months back, I decided I had enough. I end it all. I was going to relieve my parents and my sisters the burden of my existence. Unfortunately, the highway patrol officers found me at the brink of a bridge and had me hospitalized. 

After the psychiatric, I was still depressed and suicidal and wondered why I hadn't attempted a second time. I was so worthless, why not just die already? 

I realized that there is a part of me that wanted to live. Despite the constant nagging voices telling me to kill myself, I had to remind myself that I'm still here, fighting against this fucking illness. I'm here with all my imperfections, my anxiety, my depression, my self-doubt. I tell myself that at least I can show up every moment - because that is my victory.

All I'm saying all you got to do is show up. 

Sorry to hear that you are going through such a tough time."
