patientgamers,fqn2fmj,t3_gjpmze,1589487537.0,"Sonic Heroes! I haaaated this game when I played it at launch in 2004, for two valid reasons and one invalid: It was a glitchy mess that constantly flung me into pits for no apparent reason, the characters just will.not.shut.up with tutorial messages, and – unfairly – because it wasn't Sonic Adventure 3.

I got an urge to return to it last week, fully expecting to remember ""oh yeah I hate this"" and to drop it again. But I found that with the experience of age, what I once thought were random, unfair deaths, were actually predictable – though still unfair – deaths. But that meant I could learn how to work around them. The characters still won't shut up, but I can ignore that.

But what I realized most of all is that while I had fond memories of SA2, I only really liked the speed levels. And that's the entire game here. So once I learned how to handle the admittedly slippery controls, I actually enjoy way, way more of the game than I do SA2.

So I went from ""might try this for an hour"" to ""I'm gonna get all the emblems"" to ""I'm gonna get all A-ranks"" to ""well shit, I still love playing this, I guess all that's left is to learn how to speedrun it."" So that's what I'm doing now."

Edit in case someone googles up this problem: it was due to turning off the referrer header in Options > Privacy."

I've now spent every single free star the game has to offer and haven't gotten a single new 4* girl since the guaranteed ones on launch day.

PvP was already a ""instant quit if the enemy has phantom Nana"" and now it's going to be even more impossible. I think I'm just done with this game."
