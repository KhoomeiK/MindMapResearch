I'd really appreciate if we could \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ sometimes, that would help me feel appreciated."" (in the least passive aggressive way possible, i'm still working on that wording myself) Its almost like a Love Language kind of thing, and it may be the case that she's more than happy to show her appreciation, and just hasn't known how!

She has to take responsibility for her needs and desires, and its awkward, and she may feel selfish or slutty for wanting it. There's nothing wrong with her wanting to be dominated, but she needs to use more specific language to express that to the OP. You'll drive yourself crazy, trying to guess, and she'll still be unhappy, bc it wasn't whatever she imagined. Its super hard to communicate during/about sex, esp for women, so I might recommend Come As You Are by Emily Nagoski.
