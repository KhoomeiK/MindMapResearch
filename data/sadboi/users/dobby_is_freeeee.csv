He’s not actually that dumb , he is dumb in every way possible apart from in a business POV , and he’s looking at the country from a businessman POV and that’s why he’s stayed for so long , he speaks nothing but gibberish in virtually any interview he has but still makes sure the country is kept just close enough to normal so he doesn’t get any raising brows . Hitler , however, knew exactly what he was doing all the time and made sure everyone knew he knew what he was doing .

I’m (15 f) and I’ve self harmed and thought about ending it all for multiple years . Hell I’ve even attempted before , well , I more didn’t care if I survived , and when I did I just kept telling myself it wasn’t an attempt and I was just in the wrong zone . 

But , and I’m being completely honest here , it’s not always the words of he song or poem or whatever , sometimes it’s the meaning behind it . 

Maybe she likes the album because it makes her feel more understood , or maybe it makes her feel more valid for feeling the way she does . 

The one thing that has always made me feel worse is that I feel like I have no reason to feel shit ( excuse my french ) , it’s like I have no current reason after everything in my life to feel terrible now . Maybe that’s similar to how she feels ? 

it’s not the music that caused the attempt , maybe it didn’t help  , but it’s not the sole cause . I know your scared and upset and don’t know what to do , and I know you probably feel quite helpless . So does she . If I’m honest , depressing music has been proven to reduce suicide rates , but it also makes you feel more depressed when listening to it . Maybe you two could look for some music that she likes that while it isn’t depressing also makes her feel better ? I spent three years listening to cringey but horribly depressing songs like silent scream , Bullet , her last words and welcome to my life and every time while I felt worse I also felt calmer . But then I started listening to more artists like Cavetown , Sløtface , Anson Seabra and more songs like ‘all of me’ . 

I can understand completely why you don’t want her to listen to that album , but to her it must mean more than what it seems to you . To her it meant so much that it was going to be the last thing she was going to hear ,  so go through it with her , try to listen to it with her and try to get her to explain what it means to her . 

I hope this helps and I hope things go well , just let her know from me ( I know I’m a total stranger and you don’t have to if you can’t ) that it is going to be ok , this is the hardest thing to go through and you might feel completely alone , but you only live once , please make the most of it . You can change the world if you want to , the sky is the limit ! ❤️

Parenting,fk1xk7z,t3_ffw0v0,1583788872.0," First off , I’m so sorry for your loss and the fact that now your thinking about what’s best for your son shows what a great mum you are and how truly caring you are  

For now I think the advice you’ve already got is good , but for when he gets older : 

As he gets older I’d say that maybe make it normal to talk about his dad , don’t make it a forbidden topic as he’ll feel like his dad was a bad person . Just talk about him and tell your son what he was like , show him videos of when his dad was happy and make sure your son always opens up about how he’s feeling about it . And when you talk about your husband to your son , know that it’s ok to cry , but it’s also ok to be happy when you think of him . Just don’t shut the subject of his father away as he grows up as he’ll feel like he won’t know his full identity . 

I’d suggest saying something like  ‘daddy had a illness in his mind that he battled for as long as he could , but he lost his battle’ and when your son asks questions about it , answer them . Perhaps not in the most detailed way nor in the most adult way as it could make your son feel he has to carry guilt about it or look after you because of it , but just in a way that helps him to understand that it’s no ones fault and that his dad loves him no matter what . 

Maybe when your son gets a little older and wishes he could tell his dad about things , get him to write his dad letters and tie them to balloons and let them go in the sky , this will make him feel connected to his dad even though he can’t meet his dad . 

It’s going to be ok , I promise . It’s ok to cry , it’s ok to smile , it’s ok to move on . Just make sure you don’t forget . I’m so sorry that your husband lost his battle , and I’m sorry that you are in this position , but you can still be a great mum 

It’ll be ok , thoughts and prayers ❤️"
