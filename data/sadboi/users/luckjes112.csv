Why would you romanticize the propaganda image of a 'perfect family' in an era that is known for the birth of rock 'n roll, the famous 50s diner, greasers, retrofuturism etc.  
It's like if I had my interest in the 1700s and was obsessed with sheep farming."
TheRightCantMeme,fqt3zsu,t3_gkpufs,1589629221.0,"I think there's nothing wrong with romanticizing a certain era.  
I do it all the time. I'm obsessed with pirates both real and fictional.  

But you need to realize where romanticism stops and realism begins. That is: I barely know how to tie a knot. I'm trying to learn, but as it stands I would've made an awful sailor. Same goes for swordfighting. Again, trying to learn, pretty awful at it now.  
Just because you _want_ a nuclear family doesn't mean that you'd get one handed to you on a silver platter if you just time travel back to 1950.

But that's only half the problem.  
See, I love pirates. They were rebellious and ambitious.  18th century pirates tried to build their own country to get away from greedy kings. They built this country to house political prisoners, ex-slaves and of course more pirates.  
But I wont go out and demand that we start robbing merchants to make our living and that we keelhaul everyone I disagree with. That would be stupid.  

But these 1950s romanticizers _demand_ we give in to their aged obsession. They don't care about the actual family dynamics. They don't care if their wife has a personality beyond a pretty body. They will throw their kids out the minute they want to play with a toy that belongs to the opposite gender.  
They want to live in an illusion that everything is fine. And lash out at the idea that the world is more than black and white.  

To quote /u/diamundium, whom I've had a similar conversation with in the past days:  
> this unrealistic vision is so consuming as to be obsessive and irrational. I can't imagine any abstract belief being strong enough to take precedence over my support for my family members.

>They see the democratic ideology as a threat to the idea of an America that is destined to die out completely, in favor of an America that cares for everyone, not just the individuals that meet the criteria to have been considered 'American' in the 1950's. Spot on."

They like the picture of the classic 1950s nuclear family. But they don't like to see the psychology of the family or why it works or doesn't work.

I'm a romantic. I love history and I do have a romantic view of history. But I keep my romantic view of history separate from my factual view of history. I know that being a peasant was hard work, I know that I would've not been able to operate a flintlock, I know that I would probably die during the first famine.  

But these people truly don't see their romantic view of history as anything other than 100% reality. They think that the evil Democrats are trying to undermine their beautiful Fallout style 1950s retro utopia where you come home to fresh apple pie after a good day of work.  

Instead, we're just trying to gain rights for people who don't have right and make sure everyone's able to eat.
