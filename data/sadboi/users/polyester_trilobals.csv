I don't blame them for cutting me off; you're probably in a similar boat as they were. They felt trapped by me and responsible for me and my life. That burden should not be on anyone, and ultimately, you need to take care of yourself first.

I was able to get help for my ideation, and I was recently discharged from a partial program. I am safe, and I am currently speaking from experience (I don't want anyone to freak out).

This being said, if they do kill themselves, it is not your fault. I told this to my friend over and over again, and I meant it wholeheartedly. I wanted to kill myself because of me, myself, and I. We tell ourselves horrible things when we are depressed and suicidal, and we convince ourselves we aren't worthy. I get it. I've been there.
