running,fqs7ilk,t3_gkkq3e,1589600279.0,"So, I've posted about this before here but I've still yet to get it figured out. Basically, I was running 5-7 miles per day, 6 days a week for a total of 30-35 MPW for all of February and the first 3 weeks of March. All done on a treadmill. Then one day, out of nowhere, I could barely run 3 miles. My legs felt fine, but my heart rate skyrocketed early in the run and I hit 95% max within the first mile. Nothing had changed. Diet the same, sleep the same, pace the same. This only continued to get worse all through April. I took time off, came back, and I could barely run 2 miles. 

So I went to a cardiologist. Everything checked out fine. I had a blood panel done. Again, everything fine. I even had an MRI done as ordered by a neurologist. Fine, fine fine. I just ran 2 miles at a 12 minute/mile pace and nearly died. I'm STILL painfully, breathlessly recovering an hour later. Wtf is going on? 

Clearly there is something wrong physiologically. I was consistently base building in a typical linear fashion since January of 2019, when I redid C25K. Everything was completely normal until that one fateful day toward the end of March. Now, I can barely make two miles. Some days only 1.5. I've tried going as slow as possible. It makes no difference. According to my forerunner, I'm hitting 175BPM before finishing one 12 minute mile, and my HRM is ~185. Before this, I could run 7 miles at 10:30 and not hit over 165. The only time I've ever even hit 175 or higher is when I was purposely trying to.

What can I even do at this point? 

Also, it's not just running. Lifting does this to me as well."

It's sad. Joe's show was once so groundbreaking -- the only place where you could find a guy with some respectability and clout talking about conspiracy theories, hallucinogens, how to evolve as a man, martial arts and so on. Now he's become the modern epitome of a sellout. He has huge celebrities like Johnny Depp on. Millionaires like Elon Musk. Presidential candidates like Bernie Sanders. 

He's also become everything he hated. Joe was all about free use. But now his own company Bent Pixels goes after small users for copyright claims. They got Beige Frequency's excellent documentary about Shab's garbage career taken down. Joe's show is no longer live because he seems to care more about advertising revenue than being up front, raw and unedited. 

So sadly, I kind of hope the podcast just crashes and burns now. It's become a big commercial thing that's more often garbage than it is entertaining. I'll also never forgive Rogan for launching the careers of horrible unfunny douchebags like Brendan Shob, Tony Hinchfliffe, and even ""The Mommies."" Even fucking rapist Joey Diaz."

Thank you. This is really well said comment overall. The Charlotte WM match was one of the best women's matches I've ever seen, yet the ending was ridiculous. Just like you said...it came out of nowhere and ended too fast. Charlotte didn't work on Asuka's legs at all during the match. Then actually applies the figure 8 in a random moment of the match when they're both getting off of the ground. 

Then, most egregious of all, she can't post up on one of her arms, so it's a weakened figure 8 -- and yet Asuka still taps? And to be fair, she *did* last in it a little longer than most women who almost instantly tap, but this is the undefeated Asuka, at WM, for her streak and her first WWE title. I would have been fine with the ending had she passed out from the pain, or had Charlotte brutalized her leg in some fashion earlier on in the match. As it stands, that finish is my least favorite WWE booking decision ever."

She took nothing and turned it into something and I'm actually proud to be a WWE fan at the moment because someone's hard work was actually rewarded.
SquaredCircle,fq9844d,t1_fq89boe,1589189027.0,Yep. Cole is the worst announcer in pro wrestling today and the product would instantly be greatly improved if he never commentated another match again. Cole being off RAW makes a huge difference even though Tom is basically a somewhat less snarky Cole.

SquaredCircle,fq97y58,t1_fq89dqm,1589188851.0,100%. Asuka deserves to be the one to put The Man out of her misery. I think the gimmick has run its course and Becky has become a little stale. Asuka has all of the momentum in the world right now. She's been SO good that she's managed to get Vince MacMahon to be heavily behind a Japanese woman who doesn't speak English.
