I also plan to runaway from the house but that‚Äôs not a good option either. My dad is a cop and he can tracks me wherever i am. Running away would only cause me more trouble. And yes i do agree living independently would be a good start, i‚Äôm trying to save my money right now but i am not really sure if i still want to live like this for several years :("
