Anxiety,fqhm5vv,t1_fqhcf99,1589379805.0,"Thanks for this, I love all the big picture summary posts about vaccine developments, treatments, summer helping the virus subside, case counts dropping, etc. It certainly helps on days when I'm feeling down or anxious. I'm glad so many of us appreciate this group, myself included!"
Anxiety,fqex84s,t1_fqerwu4,1589315091.0,I did that calculation too (I've been keeping track on my own spreadsheet every day since I live in Illinois!) so it was reassuring to see the 13.7% number. Plus the 3 day average is still low because the 2 previous days had pretty low case counts.
Anxiety,fpvunuj,t1_fpv0817,1588952152.0,"""everyone has a voice in the sewer"" what a great quote because Everybody Poops!

That would be a useful metric that develops in real time.  I hope major metro areas can partner with them."

Anxiety,fpmcg10,t1_fpm2xak,1588730065.0,"There was a speaker about a week ago who went through the plan for contact tracing. They calculated how many tracers would be needed for the state, the hiring and training process, and all the different roles available. If I can find the link I'll post it here! But yes it is a big challenge."
Anxiety,fp3nut1,t1_fp3miqz,1588282617.0,"I am also missing our beaches and the lakefront, and hopefully they are available soon. I like in Lakeview and there's a few parks and areas that have remained open luckily. I like Chicago a lot: I know NYC gets a lot of hype, but I've found Chicago to be cleaner, full of tons of fun events and feels more like home :) also the Mayor Lightfoot memes are awesome ðŸ˜‚"

Whether the news is good or bad, it's given me some sort of media routine so I don't fall victim to the fear mongering headlines."

Statement from Dr. Fauci says it best. So happy to hear that more than just anecdotal evidence is available of how effective this drug can be!!"

Anxiety,floqf5s,t1_fljdu5y,1585343381.0,"Thank you. It's been tough, only his siblings (my mom, aunt, and my other uncle) and a rabbi could attend the funeral. I'm in another state so I wasn't home to grieve with them. It's a tough situation but trying to get through it the best I can."
Anxiety,flj245v,t3_fp3ivg,1585196659.0,"My uncle who lived in New York committed suicide this past Friday. He was bipolar and maybe the Quarantine and lockdowns there made him feel overwhelmed. He was alone in his apartment. 

Hang in there. I've had intense thoughts about self harm in the past, and every day you decide not to act on it and keep on pushing makes you incredibly strong. Try and make the best of each day inside- read a good book, avoid reading the news too much, cook a nice meal. Also there's mental health resources available if you need someone to talk to, Governor Cuomo had a link on his Twitter. All free services.

Just know you're not alone in feeling uneasy in this time. We can all get through it together!"
