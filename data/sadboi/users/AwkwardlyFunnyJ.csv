They have no education on the subject so just use it as a opportunity to spread hate because people prefer to spread hate than love or facts for that matter . It would make no difference if a apology was issue really what will it do? People will still have their own opinions . It's just the way the English were brought up to think the Irish were peasants who didnt speak their language and forced their language down our throats .

AMA,eskhyfo,t1_eskhjjb,1562065087.0,That's a long long long story.  Firstly it was a long time ago so I hold no hatred for the English over it as it's not their fault now only their ancestors . What is still ongoing and causes the bad blood is that the English people have such a fucked up view on it and think that their ancestors done no wrong . They dont see the famine graveyards here there is one in my area no one got a headstone they were all put into a huge grave dug by men who were barely alive themselves with the famine while the english still oppressed us and watched us starve to death and die with children in our arms and eat dogs .the attitude to this day is the irish deserved it when we didnt no one deserved it . It was a holocaust over 1 million people died of starvation and a further 1 million tried to emigrate and most of them died too.  The English stole part of our land and continue to insult us with it and then when ever a irish celeb does well England try to claim them as english.

I didnt think she was selfish as I know the pain she went through and how sometimes your convinced you are the problem for everything.  Kids seem down? Its because I'm not a good enough mom..etc she left them it fuckin hurt us all but I was never mad with her I was mad I dsint see her pain and I know I could of helped . Kids live with their dad they are ok but obviously it will hurt them forever but I'm glad shes at peace . My mother in law recently made a disgusting comment about selfish suicide is and said If I say someone hanging from a tree and they were alive I would leave them tbey were selfish and should realise it not get another chance . Well my god I went mad especially as my cousin died this way and she knew it.

AMA,eskg91n,t1_esj4pix,1562063575.0,It was every second or third night never any breaks other than that.  Every 3 nights for as long as I can remember but feeling like someone was there you got that feeling every day . We were a new build but different psychics described how centuries ago it was bog land and a young boy drowned in the bog land and his mother went mad after.  They each have said his spirit haunts our house as its literally where he died and he plays these tricks on us but then when hes angry scares us ans his mother haunts the place to trying to find him . He tried to move them on the son refused to leave ans he said the mother wouldn't leave until she found her son . It's a strange sad tale and I wouldn't of believed it from the two separate psychics they told us the same story bar a few small details 3 years apart. We looked into it and although there was no records back that far it was indeed bog land where our house is. Our house is a black xone we get no signal . But our neighbiur who lives only 20 feet away has no issues with signal or anything.
