(Then again, I guess in some religious circles your pleasure doesn't matter, just the husbands'!).

My mom has since become a little more liberal, and since I work at a sexual trauma center, I'm all about teaching kids the proper parts. I embarrassed the Hell out of her when I corrected her use of ""privates"" with ""vulva."" She said ""I do not see the need to use that term."" I gave her a stern talking to about how confusing it can be for a woman when we're told not to do x, y, z, to our vaginas, but we should be doing them to our vulvas (such as simple washing), or understanding hair growth, etc, and she couldn't even get through the conversation. I laughed about it later with coworkers, but at least my mom is getting better."
rimjob_steve,fmggnfr,t1_fmgdr5r,1586048620.0,"Exactly! My mom left us anti-masturbation pamphlets on our bedside tables! I caved and bought a vibrator my senior year in high school, and I think she probably found it after one embarrassing incident (it was a cheap Spencers one that turned on in my drawer somehow, but I ran up to ""fix something else in my drawer"" and was able to turn it off). The likelihood is she found it but couldn't bring herself to talk about it. Pretty sure she eventually found all those kinky notebooks too, but I will likely never hear of it.

I ended up being the cliche who let my high school boyfriend (frequently) bang me in the butt because at least I wasn't losing my vaginal virginity, but couldn't stop myself from sexual contact altogether. The guilt was palpable, and I frequently prayed for these urges to pass! I'm glad my husband and I slowly helped each other become unrepressed, but he ended up being the only person I've ever had penis to vaginal sex with, and vice versa! I no longer hold those values that a person must only have sex within marriage (not at all). I'm not religious at all anymore, in fact.

It's nice that we live in an age where via technology we can connect with others who share similar experiences. Just 30-40 years ago, we'd likely feel like we were the only ones! *Hugs*!"
rimjob_steve,fmgfia6,t1_fmgdj39,1586047878.0,"[Hypersexuality](https://psychcentral.com/lib/hypersexuality-symptoms-of-sexual-addiction/) is basically being overly sexual or even having sex addiction and is a common symptom in bipolar people. To put it in perspective, once I was introduced to porn in adulthood (thanks now-husband, lol), I once masturbated for almost 6 hours strait and the lady bits hurt for the next few days.

I already had bipolar traits by the time I hit teenage years, and due to my over religiousness, the hypersexual part was particularly guilt inducing for me, as I constantly thought about sex, what sex would be like, etc. It still gets in the way of a healthy sex life, as I tend to get a little perturbed if I don't get an insane amount of sex, but I've learned what is a reasonable expectation from a monogamous relationship.

It sounds all fun and games until you actually live it, and cause all sorts of arguments and feel frustration around it."
4chan,fmg3ayp,t1_fmg1295,1586040363.0,"Because it's not. Microchimerism is usually the result of having fetal cells left within a woman who has given birth. It can also be transferred in utero between twins, or from getting an organ donated. There is no viable research that supports the idea that people retain cells from others via sex. There is virtually no way to know if sexual intercourse itself causes male microchimerism because spontaneous abortions are much more common than people realize and could result in fetal microchimerism.

In fact, microchimerism may share a link to later degenerative diseases, such as breast cancer, thyroid disease, lupus, etc. You aren't at greater risk of those just because you're having sex (in most cases, there are possibly some anomalies such as HPV)."

But now I got fat and have stretch marks, and am afraid I'll never look okay naked again, because even if I lose the weight, the scars are still there. I think mine heavily fluctuates based on whether my body looks healthy to me or not, but I'm one of those people who really has to work an insane amount to stay skinny (weighing food, exercising an hour every day, etc), suffer from bipolar depression (have to work hard not to overeat during those periods), and am on medications known to make weight loss hard, so I don't know if I believe I can ever be fit again. :(

So, yes, if I'm a healthy weight, I like my body. If not, I don't."

There are some pretty funny/sad stories about Mormons/JWs getting married and thinking the girl was missing the ""hole"" or just not knowing what to do altogether.

I had a friend whose Baptist grandmother argued with her parents not to let her use tampons because it was penetrating her, likely ""broke her hymen,"" caused her to no longer be a virgin and was sinful.
