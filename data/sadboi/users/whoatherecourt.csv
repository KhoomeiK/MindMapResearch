Since I was 14, I had a specific goal weight. One day I found out I was 2 pounds under it. My first thought was about how much more weight I could lose."

bulimia,f9jzjj1,t3_e5bvtr,1575389474.0,"When I was a teenager, I used to purge once a week and that would be enough to keep me away from binging for DAYS. It was literally like the purge ""reset"" me as a teenager, and I was fine for the next 6 or 7 days. 

Fast forward 15 years. 

Last year I was at my worst (UW, Malnourished, purging up to 5 times a day every day). I had a huge epitome -- purging triggered the next round of binging. Purging doesn't reset me. It just makes me able to eat again. 

Sitting with the food in my stomach, as awful and anxiety-provoking and terrifying as it sounds, is one way I learned to break the binge-purge cycle. I hated how I felt the next day -- bloated, constipated, ""drunk"", rashes all over my face, my rosacea flaring up, sick because inevitably I would eat something that I was allergic or sensitive to. After a while, I learned that I didn't want to deal with how bad it felt afterward, which greatly cut down on the binging."
BingeEatingDisorder,f9jz80g,t3_e5ibo8,1575389264.0,"Binge cycles are so hard to break. I've been there. 

I used to restrict the next day after a binge, aiming for a 3 day fast to make up for all the calories I ate. This would inevitably lead to another binge, as the second I broke my fast, the survival food cravings would hit me. I kept repeating the cycle over and over, exhausting myself. What worked for me was eating breakfast. As silly as that sounds. No matter what I ate before, I would eat something before noon so that my poor body did not think I was going to starve it again for half a week."
