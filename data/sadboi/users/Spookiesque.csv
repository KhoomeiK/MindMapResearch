I ballooned in my late 20's due to major depressive episodes and continued up until now. I was 184lb right before I got pregnant and I'm 194lbs now (I'm 32). What's funny is that I was finally in the mindset to get healthy again right before I got pregnant. I had just gotten back from my honeymoon and was finally mentally prepared and looking forward to work on getting my body back. Wait... I'm pregnant? Wait... my depression is back on top of this? I have GD now, what? 

Enter the post GD sugar deprived engorgement of everything carby. Cinnamon rolls are love.

But now it's time. Time to stop eating sugar with reckless abandon. Time to stop drinking my calories. And time to start getting my ass off the couch.

My plan is to eat similarly to my GD diet but without the fear of a spike. I fear calorie reduction because it can drop milk supply and I'm struggling to make half of my baby's daily intake. Husband says we can get a treadmill with our tax returns. Once we get that, I'll be able to walk while baby sleeps and I'm looking forward to that.

My doctor said that due to how manageable my experience with GD was, it's very possible I may not have GD with my next pregnancy if I get back to my healthy weight. I have 18 months to get my butt in gear. I'm using this as motivation."
