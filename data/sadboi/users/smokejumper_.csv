First you are complaining that the game is getting more casual and 2 sentences later you are complaining that inferno is to ""hard""(?) and that you cant ""dick around""? What do you even expect from a competitive shooter?

The SG didnt change at all for all of csgo except being 250$ lower priced wich is a bit more than a flashbang for a short time to encourage players to play it. Now it got nerfed to Its actually balanced and got its old price tag so where is the problem here?

Csgo propably has one of the best hitreg of all shooters out there right now. People just cant understand that there are so many factors why they miss shots like not standing still 100%, the enemy moving, just bad aim etc. (Also there is a thing called latency wich is pretty much impossible to ""fix"")

The 128 tick thing has been long debunked and there is no noticable difference as this video shows and explains: https://youtu.be/a9kw5gOEUjQ

To the anticheat i only can say that i have encountered 1 noticable hacker since the time i started playing actively again wich is roughly 2 months ago. Prime is also completely free you just need to get to level 21 but i just dont understand why you even mention it if you first complained that the game is apperently flooded with cheatears since its free. So where would be the problem again even if prime would cost 15$?"
