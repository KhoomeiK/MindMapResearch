Gonna sink the ship? If there is approx. 150 cases or so why wouldn't they opened a safe place in some hospital and got them in.

You ain't gonna built a 5 star hotel. You are gonna built something with the leaves and sticks and smthn. 

I think the important thing is here to do a safe zone, send enough medical supplies and doctors and nurses.

If we think Japan is one of the most growing economies and have a technology, they can at least built a quarantine tent. And even if they can't they could at least separate the infected and not infected. This is not a bloodborne disease, it is so contagious. If this was Ebola or some stuff it wouldn't be this alarming."
China_Flu,fhgnlms,t1_fhgmoo9,1581572369.0,"Tbh China's regime might be shit on the good days but at the worst days they are doing a decent job of at least trying to contain shit. Most of the world is didn't even cared about this until shit hit the fan. 

Let's think this way, in that cruise ship people are isolated in their rooms if they are a passanger,  they might have diseases if it isn't corona. And they might die from it. And even not that this is an human to human contact disease, so lets say you touched something that may have been touched by a infected person or etc. 

Hospitals are common to spread diseases, for example most of the MRSA cases happen in the long hospital stays. Not in the outside world. Because if there is an virus or bacteria around and when you are longer period around it you have a more chance to get infected. So probably all that ship is now infected. And maybe most of them would die for it (I am guessing they are more elderly in that ship.)

Japan can do better and we all know it."

To be honest I have no solid reason to be this sad. You know when you lost your loved one or something, you have a reason. You can be sad and no one would judge it.

SuicideWatch,fg8bii3,t1_fg87yj6,1580614720.0,"Tbh I have a dog and dogs help in fact I think they understand people more than humans understand eachother.

I am a very nihilistic person. For all my life I searched for a meaning, and tried to do meaningful things but eventually I gave up. I have a damage, we all do to some extent. But my concerns were that whatever we do it doesn't matter in anyways. Cause even if changes a course of action of life events, we are all gonna die, and world's gonna end eventually anyway. So I was caught up in an existenial crisis. I was dissociated, spiraled, got even more depressed. And I stumbled upon a theory called Quantum Immortality which very ways affected me. I know it's just a theory. But If it is true, even if we die we continue to suffer maybe our conscioussness, or somehow in another-dimensional universe. Because I believe in this world which is full of rage, untolerance,hatred we don't come to get just tested from god or something. We came cause living is actually making a difference. Beating the odds is important whereas becoming a percentage of a number isn't.

So relatively suicide may be an answer to solution to this suffering but we cannot be sure it's a permenant answer. And it differs from what do you believe in life? And what you believe if any things happen in afterlife (which even if exists)

Anyway I am sorry for like talking about very complicated issues. I am not gonna say happiness, things will change blah blah cause I don't truly believe all of those things. I believe that some people are easily living because they just simply don't care or putting up a facade. They are not suffering, and even feeling happy because they don't care and move past any shit ever happend to them. And most of all, they don't think. So all I can say to you is, it's harder for some people to be most of the people. But even those some people might find some happiness after all."
SuicideWatch,fg856m6,t3_exchw9,1580609822.0,"I agree with most of your opinions and I think it is selfish for people to use the selfishness card and say ""But what would I do without you."" or somethings like that. I understand that people may not want you to die. But it's so selfish to say ""stick around for me"". I think that's the real selfish act. People should have the control of their own life.

Now the second part of my point, yes society is hypocrite and saying only to stick around because when you die they did their part. They tried to ""save"" you and failed. Now they feel remorseful whatsoever. But the truth is, fuck it. 

You don't owe anyone to anything except yourself. You are your own person. But before taking your life don't think about anyone except yourself. Cause suffering is bad, I know for a fact. But when you die, you WILL continue to suffer. Think like this, lets say in this scenario of yourself killing yourself is the painkiller. Now when you took a painkiller, pain doesn't go away. You just don't feel it for awhile. It's still there. THE ONLY TRUE WAY TO END YOUR SUFFERING IS NOT TO KILL YOURSELF, rather accept the fact you have wounds, you have pain. If you not acknowladge those things you will continue to suffer. But If you acknowladge it and not try to bleach every bad thing ever happend to you and then chose to show your wounds and live with it like a mf goddamn war hero."
