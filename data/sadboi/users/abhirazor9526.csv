cheers to you"
depression,fno1l8s,t1_fnntba0,1587108761.0,"I am sorry you feel that way...But here's the thing ...as painful as it sounds you have to work your way to earn everything..Just because you want or desire something doesn't mean you deserve it..This is the harsh truth of life i go through experiencing everyday..I have suffered through anxiety and low self esteem since i was a kid.. got through engineering , college , but was not eligible to be recruited by a firm..I was never quite confident of the idea that someone would even pay me for doing work.. because I was confident that I would suck at every kind of work 'cause my anxiety and constant overthinking would stop me from focussing on the task at hand. I got my first job at age 27 because i kept post poning everything due to the same fears..but by the time i went out in the world everything had changed...my peers were earning 4 times what I am.. some are married and settled , I on the other hand am 4 yrs late to everything.Talk about adding depression to anxiety...I just got off a job as a Network Engineer in a private bank..There was a girl over there I fell in love with ..still obsessed about her..having sleepless nights , dreaming about a future with her, but guess what?? I want her , but she may not want me back, she's ambitious , smart and pretty ...I am dead serious when i say I'm  in love with her..but she doesn't bother to even check my messages let alone replying to them..I don't fault her though,any girl would want to be with some guy who's well settled, earns a reasonably good salary...well i don't fit those criteria , I am trying everything I could to do so but I am afraid I've lost a significant amount of time..What I mean by this long post is that the world only looks for value, If i don't offer any to you then I am useless, You're 25 right ?? Still you've got 3 years on me, just add value to yourself, hit the gym , make yourself look better, learn an instrument if you can, If you are happy with yourself, people will start appreciating you.If you want to tell someone you want something from them you better have enough bargaining power ...and those hugs and kisses you crave might surely follow..Atleast that's what i like to tell myself..I know life isn't easy for a lot of us..but for some reason you shouldn't quit on your desires like I won't quit until I express my feelings to my crush.. Atleast i would've tried.."

depression,fmtl60x,t3_fx1mos,1586374615.0,God that sounds so familiar. I am about to turn 28 this August. Always been an introvert . i haven't been very socially awkward though but when it comes to the opposite sex I am just dumbfounded. I have always been anxious through out my life until now . Letting opportunities go because I was too afraid of screwing up something only to end up being the laughing stock. Hence I never approached a girl ever. I have been a pretty below average looker. I've always been insecure. I quit a job as network engineer 'cause the pay wasn't good enough. There was this girl there I was so crushing on and still do. We never talked much besides work while I was there. I did manage to befriend her on Facebook though. Got some dating tips from my buddy to help me out. But guess what she wouldn't bother even checking my messages let alone replying to them. I haven't slept well since the day i quit office. I just don't want to let go the one girl i feel genuinely affectionate for. My family n friends think of me as a loser and are just going to set me up with some strange person for me to settle down and have kids with 'cause I don't have it in me to do the one thing that almost every living creature does and that is find a mate i wanna be with. It just feels pointless to me to live my life just to live to work and not with the person I want to ...It feels unfair that I never even got a chance to talk to her ..but I am still hopeful of creating that opening only to get more depressed . Was going to ask her out to dinner and now this corona shit happens...Had no one to share this with ..sorry my reply is longer than your post .. It's 1 am as I type  this and I Just wanted to say that I am in the same boat as you ..I feel your pain....
depression,fmfhtgp,t3_fur5c7,1586027541.0,"The sad truth is it never gets better completely. Just when you go out do something and it feels like things are getting sorted out , then all of a sudden something happens and depression hits you back again. Getting muscles doesn't guarantee you get a girl. I am losing my mind over a girl who doesn't even bother checking my messages let alone replying to them . As much as we don't like to admit it people crave value in everything , living or non living. If i don't offer any value to you I am worthless .By doing something I might actually try to feel valuable for myself. Atleast that's how I am trying to deal with depression . Been trying to learn the guitar , I play a little everyday and i suck at it.  But I am trying to build value in myself to get my mind off of the fact that I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for a long while now and the one girl who i so adore is indifferent towards me and is only adding to my depression but I can't fault her though because I offer no value that she may want . I wish I was normal . Almost everyone who suffers from depression does .. but the hard truth is people won't get us and the only thing to do is adapt and get better at dealing with it ..."
depression,fm1u92e,t3_fsj41w,1585685112.0,"You're not alone...I am in a very similar situation right now. Family n friends (whatever little) I have don't understand me..The world only looks for value ..If i don't offer any to you then I am worthless... Haven't achieved anything in life in education , profession or elsewhere . Quit a job which was too frustrating for me..I did Ok while I was there , was a dependable worker. Fell in love with a girl who was my senior. Could never ask her out or even befriend her while I was there and now she doesn't even bother to even read my messages , let alone replying to them. Why ?? Because I offer no value to her . Some guy with an average IQ , below average looks , insecure and anxious , currently jobless causing me sleepless nights ever since the day i quit office. The world only craves value n as I get older I am losing what little I have to offer . Therapy is costly even in my country (India) ..Why am I ranting this to you ?? I guess it's only comforting to know you're not alone in this....."
