It takes an uglier turn when they put up with sexual abuse of their kids for the same reason. Women’s rights isn’t some stupid ass political bullshit; Women’s rights is preventing what I just described to you: Men raping kids and beating the blood, spit, and shit out of someone smaller than them because she can’t get more than a minimum wage job despite being able to fill any one of the higher-paying construction, painting, roofing, or lawn care jobs in her own damn neighborhood.
