AskReddit,fcvooqg,t1_fcul51q,1578006658.0,I’m in the same exact boat. I think having no expectations help. Don’t set any standard to how meeting someone should go.

TwoXChromosomes,fcpguvl,t3_ei9axq,1577863446.0,"I thought my 2019 was perfect. Recently finished school got a promotion at my job, etc etc, except 2 weeks ago I walked in on my gf of 10 years with her coworker naked asleep in our bed. I was going to propose soon, i was trying to get the ring for the 10 year but just needed another month or 2. We talked a little a few days later....she claims she needs help, therapy and maybe even AA. She wants to know if I would answer her call in 6 months. I was so angry when I found them that I called her brother and then my mother. Obviously they all agree we can’t be together. But am I wrong for wanting her back am I wrong for wanting her back now. The last 2 weeks have been a blur. Lack of sleep, food, energy, will to live honestly....  what’s wrong with me"
