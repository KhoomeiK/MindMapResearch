I could see how from Tammy’s perspective Kelsey is over dramatic and I don’t blame her for sharing her concerns with Peter. That said, Peter is stupid for telling Kelsey “so I heard you had a mental breakdown??” He could have worded that better. And I don’t condone them spreading a rumor about pill popping either.

That said these women all agreed with Tammy regarding Kelsey and then later acted like they didn’t. Sydney gaslighting Tammy was despicable. And she only called her crazy after Tammy called her out."

YOU ARE AT A RISK OF DEATH. If you had a daughter, and she was getting strangled by her bf, but told you “nooo I looove him I’m not leaving” you would smack her and forcefully take her away. That’s probably what your mom would feel if she knew this ABUSER tried strangling you.

I’m telling you you have to go. I don’t give a fuck what he tells you. This is your LIFE.

He is not a good person. Everyone thought Jeffrey Dahmer was a charming man, and Ted Bundy was a charismatic guy. Guess what. They killed people, and the former cannibalized them. Doesn’t mean shit how “nice” they act.

This is an EMERGENCY and a violent situation. You need to act now. Leave. Call a women’s shelter, get that order of protection, call the cops.

As for mom and family. Sadly they misunderstand ADHD the most especially for women, you know? Women are expected to be organized at all times and when they are not...they get treated worse than a man with adhd. Even now for me, my whole family is pissed at me for not cleaning my room etc after two weeks. Shit just kept popping up and I’m busy at school but I’ll get to it...they don’t understand that life tasks take a LOT more energy for us than for them....So I no longer put stock in what they say (lazy, crazy, slob I heard it all)

So take some time to rest and relax. Then slowly make your next game plan and move. I recommend the adult adhd toolkit, it’s a book.

This is your time, your life, and if they can’t support it, that’s not your problem. You have to do what’s best for you. Simply leave it at that, and they can’t dictate your life.

I’m not saying it’s easy.  I’m saying it’s really fucking hard but let it make you that much stronger, that much more determined to be what you set out to be. Did you know stutterers on average have a higher IQ? Some of the most talented singers, politicians, artists etc. stutter.

You are NOT worthless, and what they did to you does NOT define you. And the terror and panic you felt was valid and I’m here to tell you it’s NOT YOUR FAULT. None of this. The pain you feel now, don’t let it drive you to suicide because I am telling you, you are a man of strength and dignity no matter what happened.

Please please don’t let them win, and do whatever you need to in order to pick up the pieces of your life. You were raped, yes, but that was something that happened to you, it’s not who you are. As for what your girlfriend said...she herself is also traumatized and sadly, male rape victims don’t get the attention they deserve, so she also was probably unaware of how to respond. It happens more than you think...and if she still persists, then she has no empathy. There is a LOT of misinformation when it comes to dealing with men who went through this. 

Please, please get counseling from someone who can help make victims specifically. File a police report, save any evidence from the crime, see if the police can get video or witnesses, etc. lawyer now.
