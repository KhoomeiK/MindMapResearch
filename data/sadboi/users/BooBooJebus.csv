Doomers,fqzyoc6,t1_fqzxmb3,1589778785.0,"Pain is part of being alive. What makes a difference is not how much pain you experience or how severe that pain is, but how you choose to respond to it. Without the pain of loss, the horrible truth that all things in time descend into ruin and nothingness— the beginnings of things and pleasurable experiences would have no meaning. The endings, the pain, the bitter hopeless misery, are essential parts of the beautiful necessary whole. 

“Life is objectively a fucking shit”

I submit to you that you do not know or understand as much as you think you do. There’s only so much the tiny nodes of consciousness that we call our selves are even physically capable of perceiving, let alone comprehending. Life MAY be a fucking shit. I don’t honestly know. What I do know is that if I act as if I believe life could be good. One day. For me or for my kids or for my kids’ hypothetical kids. Then life feels much more meaningful. And this seems relatively consistent across human beings. Those who disagree are those yet to dig out of their hole. And some never do. 

When you are frustrated with your life feel it and let it pass. You are not your body. You are not your brain. You are a part of everything. Feel it let it pass be present. Meditate pray do whatever you have to. Find something"

musictheory,fquvxlg,t1_fqumzbx,1589665364.0,"Sloop John B was a cover. Brian arranged the recording but didn’t compose the song. The chord structures of most actual Brian wilson compositions starting around 1965 or so are actually extremely complex, often with large extended chords, extremely frequent modulation, weak root notes, stuff like that. Rhythmically, the music tends to be somewhat simple but the chord changes are unlike anything else. Even some of his most harmonically complex compositions like Don’t Talk, Wonderful, or Surf’s Up will likely not sound particularly complex to an untrained ear because his commitment to harmonious resolutions, music that feels good to listen to, is so strong. 

Like I don’t know if this is 100% accurate but here’s my from-memory transcription of a chord chart for the first verse of don’t talk:

Dm - Dm7 - Dm6/F - E7 - Gm6/Bb - Aaug - Dm7/C - Bb - Am - Gm7

Just extremely fun to play because the music itself is so rich and colorful yet sounds so ordered and beautiful and harmonious. 

Other favorite wilson progressions with these qualities include Stevie, Darlin, Til I Die, The Night Was So Young, Airplane, and Melt Away. Look any of those songs up on surfermoon if you want to learn some great pop songs with complex chord changes.

Edit: and the bridge of Still I Dream of It. Written for Frank Sinatra by Brian and never properly released. Amazing changes.

The other thing people often overlook is the type of tape being used. If you want a relatively full spectrum mix then type II or “high-bias” tape stock ideally less than 90 minutes is what you need. The normal bias type I cassettes have their own sound and it’s really cool as like an effect if you want really slammy saturated bass or something but it’s hard to use it just as an effect throughout a whole song because...

What they never tell you before you buy a four track is that they are all horribly calibrated! If you want to bounce out an instrument from a cassette recording to a DAW or ADAT or reel to reel or whatever you will notice a significant wobble when you try to line it up with the rest of the track. This problem persists to varying degrees depending on your machine but it is usually just as bad recording in as it is playing back. You can use the pitch function during your bounce to correct for this to some degree but basically if you want it to sound 100% you have to commit to a mix done totally on high bias tape stock imo and even then you’re sacrificing a lot both in sound and level of control over the project just basically for vibe points. 

I’ve gotten good sounding mixes with four tracks and they’re fun as hell and teach you a lot about getting you arrangement right before hitting record and stuff ime but they’re not all that musically useful in the long run. I’d go for at least a four track reel to reel if you want like a commercial product with that old school tapey thing. If it’s for demos then cassette is fucking great for that. The Beach Boys Stevie demo sounds like it was tracked on a cassette machine to me and it sounds fucking awesome!!

Edit if you have any other questions about four track cassette machines you can dm me there’s a ton of misinformation and I used one for several years. I can share some mixes I did with it if you want too!"

audioengineering,f7vmvfd,t3_dxq3xk,1574025177.0,"Keep your speakers out from the walls *and* treat the room. Bass collects in corners and reverberates back into the room so bass traps at your 90 degree angles are the most important thing IME. Diffusers and absorbers on the walls. Wherever sounds good to you. Even putting more furniture in your room can make it sound better. 

I think the space behind you is no big deal, possibly even a good thing. Tiny rooms will almost always color your sound and skew your perceptions so having the monitors firing into a big void is better than letting their signals bounce around a tiny cell. If you can cover the hole just with absorbers while you’re working, that would probably be good. Kill the sound as it goes out into the living room and kill more of it as it bounces back to you from behind. My priority would be covering those corners in the mixing room though. 

What’s the ceiling height? It’s pretty difficult to make any room with a ceiling 9” or less sound decent. If the room is really really tiny you’re better off totally killing it and covering everything up with absorbers IMO"

The other three channels were all then used to dub vocals. The bouncing, large rooms, echo chambers, and lack of dubbing on instrumentals accounts for the washy, “muddy” sound of those BB records. 

As far as BB vs Beatles albums fidelity in the 60s, the only album you can really say is “superior” in fidelity to any other is Abbey Road, simply because the recording tech used on that record was so much greater. But it’s barely if even a top 5 Beatles record because there’s so much filler and Beach Boys had caught up in terms of technology and fidelity by albums like Surfs Up in 1971."
