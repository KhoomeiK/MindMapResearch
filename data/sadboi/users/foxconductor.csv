It has been particularly helpful to think about more destructive behaviors as the little girl inside not getting her needs met- she‚Äôs young, traumatized, and has no idea how to take care of herself! She‚Äôs like 8yo, of course she‚Äôs flipping out. It is very healing to think about self-soothing as taking care of her, and opens the door for more compassion and patience.

BPD,fmvjjov,t3_fxlw0n,1586419269.0,"I am so sorry for this! I definitely empathize, I split a lot during sex and it can be really upsetting and frustrating for both me and my partner. 

It‚Äôs inherently a very vulnerable space, so it‚Äôs not entirely unsurprising. Even if we feel fine (!!!) and nothing weird happened, trauma responses happen at a very visceral level and we may not be consciously aware of what‚Äôs happening. 

If you‚Äôve heard of the book The Buddha and the Borderline, she has a few chapters about splitting during sex and relationships in general that I found super validating and helpful. üíú"
BPD,fmvj7ft,t3_fxm4t2,1586418916.0,"For context I‚Äôm 25 and I‚Äôve been in therapy (DBT and others) for ~7 years, on and off. Along the way there were definitely points where I felt like I had ‚Äúrecovered‚Äù, and I had in some ways, but looking back I can see I was still hurting and struggling to process. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll feel similarly about myself now in another seven years. 

I think the biggest change is stability. I know myself intensely, and I know that disruption to my life, relationships, and routine will bring a symptom flare up of some kind. I feel better equipped to weather those flare ups and still maintain basic self care without destructive behaviors. But there are certainly trauma-related things that make it really difficult, but I do feel resilient as I get older. 

My only goal through treatment has been ‚Äúless intense, less often‚Äù and I can say with a lot of pride that I have continued to surprise myself in that respect. I will never be ‚Äúcured‚Äù of BPD in the same way I will never be cured of my trauma, but along the way, and through advocacy for myself and others, I have developed an intense compassion and patience for myself. I try to care for myself as I wish I had been cared for as a child."

The small bit of alliteration there is very effective. I don't have a ton of feedback, I think this is a strong poem! The line ""thoughts violate baked walls"" feels a bit clunky, if there is a resonance or reference here it's not coming through as well. 

The second to last stanza is great as well. It's got a good rhythm to it, and the repetitive form emphasizes each pair of words in a nice way. I actually really like the first line of the last stanza! It's a shift from the previous lines and I think very refreshing in that. If anything, maybe toy around with the last two lines to complement that one. They're solid, and could be more impactful with a revisit to word choice.

survivorsofabuse,f94oqtk,t3_e3jkml,1575096170.0,"Thank you for sharing your experiences, I imagine you have processed and thought of this a lot over the years. 

I have some similar experiences- at age 6 and then again at age 11/12 I would play games with girls my age that I remember being sexual in nature. The weird thing is I don‚Äôt really remember the specific acts we were doing, but do remember pretending to be ‚Äúthe boy‚Äù while humping on each other, having our clothes off and hiding under the covers/somewhere private. 

I have always wanted to reach out to them, especially from when I was 11, but I worry they don‚Äôt remember and will be disgusted or do remember but feel very badly about it. I don‚Äôt remember who suggested it both times, but i‚Äôm scared it was me since I have two distinct memories with different girls. 

I feel like those experiences were formative in my sexuality, I started masturbating very early and am queer as an adult. Sometimes I wonder if I was abused as a young young child but don‚Äôt have any concrete memories. 

It‚Äôs hard to say if it‚Äôs harmful, or curiosity, or maybe some of both. I definitely empathize with you, know that you‚Äôre not alone!"
BPD,f94n8pn,t3_e3eytd,1575094375.0,"This is really, really incredible. I can only imagine some of the difficulty and struggle to research, prioritize, and push yourself, and as well the triumph and validation of understanding and healing. 

This is truly what we all, regardless of history or diagnosis, can hope for and work towards. 

I have a similar timeline- diagnosed at 19 and now at 25 don‚Äôt meet the criteria any longer. I went through extensive trauma starting at 6 years old through adulthood, and was fortunate enough, after a lot of pain and difficulty with the mental health system, to be in therapy from 19-23.

I wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm 100% recovered- there‚Äôs still an undercurrent that can swell up when grief and trauma occur, for sure. I‚Äôve experienced a lot of sexual assault and related trauma that has significantly affected my identity and sexuality. But every day I‚Äôm working towards the goal of, as my therapist described it, *less intense, less often.* 

This was really moving and validating to read. We are not incurable, we just need patience and healing- from ourselves and others.

But I was real heated that day, so first I was venting angrily all the things I was feeling at the moment, planned to look over it later when I was calm and write appropriately about the issues.

AmItheAsshole,f7jmyka,t3_dwg9lb,1573781426.0,"YTA- you‚Äôre teaching them a lesson to... what, focus their study intentions based on information readily available to them? 

Test answers would be different. I would posit that a copy of the test isn‚Äôt ~that~ far from a detailed study guide. All that‚Äôs going to happen is they‚Äôre going to intentionally study based on this information (which is still the goal: comprehension and diligent preparation) and get screwed because you have a point to prove with a student *from last year.* 

I work at a school. Our goal is not to corner students into learning hard lessons, but to support them in navigating the world and it‚Äôs challenges through honest feedback and motivation. If I found out about this behavior from staff, I would have more than a few words of feedback for you and your supervisor."
AmItheAsshole,f7jmdjf,t1_f7j1156,1573780958.0,"I hear you, but it wasn‚Äôt the test answers the student found last year or that they‚Äôre proposing to leave out, but the test itself. In that case, the students would still have to study and have a grasp of the material to know what answers are right. So even though they‚Äôd be studying the wrong things, it‚Äôd still be them studying, not memorizing answers. 

I also don‚Äôt have any sympathy for cheating. I just think finding out what will be on the test versus what the answers are going to be is slightly different, particularly in terms of how that affects their learning and comprehension."

SkincareAddiction,f6gg4dt,t3_dr92ow,1572825519.0,"A little background: 25F, currently living in CA. My skin‚Äôs always been very oily, but fortunately I‚Äôve been extremely lucky acne-wise and haven‚Äôt put a lot of thought into my skin over the years. Spent the last year traveling all over the country in a van, where my skincare routine consisted of Burt‚Äôs Bees cleansing wipes most days, and occasionally toner and some rose water when I had the chance. I recently moved into an apartment and had a lot of space and time on my hands while job hunting to pick up a new interest‚Ä¶ which brought me here. My field is emotionally taxing and skincare has been a really revitalizing way to practice self care. Now, onto it!

* Skin Type: oily (I think?) and dehydrated.
* Concerns: redness around my nose and mouth, working on understanding/controlling oil production. Also lifelong Sicilian dark circles.
* Current skin goals: reduce redness, protection from external irritants (looking at you, CA wildfires), balanced oil production.

**Current Routine:** 

**AM:**

* Rinse with cool water
* Lush Breath of Fresh Air toner- don‚Äôt really like this at all. Had a Lush gift card over the summer before I started my skincare journey, currently looking for a replacement. It doesn‚Äôt irritate me fortunately but I‚Äôm not a fan of the fragrance.
* 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine eye cream- just received this in my Dermstore BeautyFix box, and I‚Äôm in love. I was hoping for an eye cream for dark circles and this one is cooling and smells amazing. My partner says I smell like cookies after my routine and I‚Äôm not mad about it!
* \[it Cosmetics Confidence in a Gel Lotion moisturizer\] Only if I‚Äôm feeling particularly dry.
* Laura Mercier Tinted Moisturizer (SPF 30)- This has been my only ‚Äòmakeup‚Äô product during the work week and I‚Äôm pretty happy about it. I was able to find a perfect match to my skin tone and it doesn‚Äôt rub off or flake.

**PM:**

* If I‚Äôm wearing makeup: Pacifica Purify Facial Cleansing Wipes- these smell lovely and the texture is enough to get off eyebrows and mascara without irritating my skin.
* Cleanser:
   * TULA Skincare the cult classic purifying face cleanser- also from the BeautyFix box. This has a nice feeling, slightly odd but not bad smell. Kind of like baby powder. Not sure if I‚Äôd rebuy, but looking for a similarly gentle cleanser.
   * Pacifica Kale Detox Deep Cleaning Face Wash- I like this a lot, typically use it in the shower (about 3-4 times a week) for an extra clean feel. Smells lovely.
* Lush Breath of Fresh Air toner
* Caudalie Vinoperfect Radiance Serum- BeautyFix as well. It has a very runny texture that feels cooling and comfortable on my skin. I don‚Äôt quite know yet what I should be looking for in a serum, but I like this so far!
* 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream
* It Cosmetics Confidence in a Gel Lotion moisturizer- Man, this is the product that has been the most pivotal in my skincare journey so far. I am a very oily person in general, and have always avoided moisturizer to not ‚Äòadd to the problem‚Äô. For nearly a year I used toner and rose water only. When I discovered \~gels\~ I was very excited to try, and this product has not disappointed. It leaves my skin feeling silky and glow-y all day well into the night. Definitely a HG for me!

**Others:**

* Heritage Store Rosewater- now that I‚Äôm in the club I know I need more moisture (lol) but this is a nice refresher during the day or to set makeup. Prefer Mario Badescu but I couldn‚Äôt find it.
* Laneige Water Sleeping Mask- I would have never thought this oily girl would use a sleeping mask, but this has been a godsend when the air‚Äôs got my skin feeling terrible. If I use this at night, I add the TULA cleanser the next morning.
* Boscia Luminizing Black Mask- This is super fun to use for both the mad tightening and the peel off. I don‚Äôt use more than 1x per week this time of year but it‚Äôs a nice Sunday morning treat.
* Dr Dennis Gross Extra Strength Daily Peel- I‚Äôm not gonna like, I don‚Äôt exactly understand this one or what would adequately replace it (I‚Äôve got 2 left!) but I seriously love it. It doesn‚Äôt irritate my skin (more than it‚Äôs supposed to, I think) though it does make my eyes water! I usually follow this with the water sleeping mask and feel so clear and hydrated.

Being housing insecure is an incredibly complex and difficult experience, and it's easy to judge and try to police the way people use the money. These folks face a lot of barriers to accessing resources, judgement, ridicule, and violence from communities, and inescapable drug addiction. 

If you are giving money to people who are panhandling, you need to accept the reality that they are not bound to you and whatever story they told. Give and accept what is, or don't."

I think you're right in saying your dad is not an asshole for asking. Especially if you are his only child and he happens to be flying into your city, I can understand why he'd be excited and think you would be too!

Just the fact that you'll be tired I don't think is just cause, but honestly it's a pretty crappy plan. I could think of a lot of scenarios where I have layovers near people I love, including my parents and/or children, and wouldn't ask them to come to the airport at 5am. 

All the people ranting about how your father has 'lost countless nights of sleep for you'- it's not an equal sum situation. Our parents make sacrifices while raising us that are unmatched in many ways. Those sacrifices are made to help us grow up to be independent, critically-thinking adults who can set healthy boundaries. By empathetically telling him how you feel, you've done well by him and the sleep he's lost for you."

I have had very similar experiences and I'll share with you the thing I always do: give it 24 hours. Anytime I get a weird/upsetting/uncalled for message, I know my emotions run high and rarely respond the way I want. Cut yourself some slack and give it some time- if you decide to respond later, that's a reasonable thing to do, but we never help ourselves by responding while in crisis.

I totally know what you mean, but I think it's a well composed photo and people will want to see your face, so will probably swipe through and then see your other photos. #1 now is really nice of your face but is washed out, so I think better later in your set.

We could get into exactly why that sub is in the state that it's in, but with everything else we go through- I think it's best to leave it where it is. People are a lot better here <3"
BPD,euym3ov,t3_chwe8b,1564104880.0,"Damn am I sorry! First of all, there is no trauma championship. Your story is yours and your experiences are not up for anyone's judgment or ridicule. I'm so, so sorry you had to read messages like that. Even if we folks with BPD feel like imposters sometimes, there is no extent of our pain and suffering that would be worth faking. 

From this girl's very first messages, it's clear that she's hurting in a very, very, serious way. I don't condone or think what she said is okay in any respect... every hurtful thing she wrote, lashing out and undermining your experience, reeks of being in a lot of pain. I obvs don't know the context of the first part, but it sounds like someone was super inconsiderate and/or abusive given some recent trauma she's been through, and it makes sense she wants to invalidate someone else to feel better about how she was treated. 

I write all that not to diminish your pain and experiences. I just find, especially with people who have hurt me deeply, and repeatedly, empathy is one of the only tools I have. 

Space is probably good for you both. I wouldn't be surprised if she comes around at another time in your life with more insight about the way she spoke to you. Maybe not. But at the end of the day, you are doing the best that you can with the tools that you have. No slip up, argument, episode, or other misstep makes that untrue. 

Sometimes with self-compassion comes along compassion for others, too. It can be helpful at different points, but if focusing on empathy for her makes the sting of her words hurt less, hold to that. If focusing on yourself and the work you're doing (which I and everyone else here are so impressed and proud of you for!!) is what helps more, stick with that. 

In either case, distract, my dude! Dwelling on this and trying to think your way out of it probably won't help much. Regardless of context, empathy, perspective, etc... that stuff stings a lot. Give yourself a little extra love today, however feels best for you."
BPD,euyktla,t3_chufhi,1564104294.0,"I have had lots of group therapy experiences and mixed feelings about all of them- I think what it comes down to is what you want from the experience. It's different from individual therapy, while for both you could say ""what you put in is what you get out"" but I think that's especially true for group therapy. 

My first experience was incredibly eye-opening. The social anxiety was terrible at first, especially coming fresh off a long inpatient stay, but for the first time in my life, I realized other people felt the same things as I did. People who looked different and the same as me, were old or young or parents or homeless or anything- it was more than I ever could have expected. 

The second time I felt that way was when I found this sub. 

It's all about what your goal is. I think group therapy can be a powerful supplement for individual DBT work, but it's no replacement. I'd say give it some time, it definitely doesn't feel comfortable right away but it's worth giving it some extra time. After being to a few group therapy programs I was able to determine what worked for me and what didn't, but I wouldn't have known that later on if I hadn't stuck it out in the first one. 

Good luck, and excited for you!"

BPD,euyjo6r,t3_chvlad,1564103724.0,"Yeah, I can totally relate to this! My father did the same thing for many years, especially the doubling down when he realized I was upset. I always felt incredibly embarrassed not only to be the butt of jokes, but also because I was upset about it in the first place. 

I think parents doing this to us makes us feel like we‚Äôre unsafe around the people who are supposed to protect us. It makes us feel ashamed about our super normal reactions to being treated poorly, and we probably subconsciously second guess if we‚Äôre overreacting.

The double whammy of telling us repeatedly that they had it worse, etc etc etc (my father did and still does this) reinforces that we‚Äôre overreacting in some way, and makes us hyper aware of our emotional responses. It‚Äôs exhausting! 

I‚Äôm so sorry you experienced this, and that your mother treated you with such disregard. I hope you have peace from that treatment now ‚ú®"
BPD,euyikgo,t3_chw2ri,1564103126.0,"Hey! I‚Äôm sorry to hear you‚Äôve been having a difficult time, but glad you‚Äôre finding information and resources that help. 

Pretty much across the board, it‚Äôs known that there‚Äôs no specific medication that treats BPD as a whole, but drugs can help address and mitigate symptoms associated with BPD (depression, anxious or manic episodes, panic attacks, insomnia, paranoia, etc). Often times people have comorbid disorders as well, so medication can treat those other disorders and help with BPD symptoms as well. 

The one agreed upon treatment for BPD is a therapy called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, or DBT. It was specifically developed for patients with Borderline and many, many people have found solace and relief through individual and group therapies within this system. 

Because BPD is often rooted in trauma, and has a lot to do with attachment and abandonment issues, understanding the causes of these intense feelings often is more effective at mitigating symptoms than any blanket effect from a drug. 

Everyone is different, of course, and I hope you are able to talk to a counselor or seek treatment as you work through all this info. 

I can‚Äôt link anything at the moment, but searching DBT on google or on this subreddit would offer a lot of info on the specifics of treatment, as well as people‚Äôs personal experiences. I‚Äôve been in DBT for about five years now, and cannot speak enough to the profound impact its had on my life. 

Coming around to a diagnosis can be overwhelming to say the least, so I hope if nothing else you are able to find some folks on here to process with, or a trusted friend or loved one while you consider next steps."

This may not be helpful or applicable for you, but sometimes reaffirming physical touch and connection can help melt these thoughts away. The more they come, the more I want to stew, the more I stew, the more I want to distance myself from my partner. 

It‚Äôs tough, and I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in this boat. If it‚Äôs any consolation, I‚Äôm here with you at the moment, doing the same thing! If anything, it‚Äôs an episode, is not representative of our feelings or our relationship as a whole, and will pass."

BPD,euy5gh2,t3_ccocc4,1564095804.0,"You‚Äôre definitely on the right track here. A lot of the root causes of BPD (as far as anyone knows) are due to experiences and trauma, and DBT is an incredibly powerful tool to address unhealthy coping mechanisms and thought patterns. 

My therapist has a saying that goes like this: 

If you‚Äôre drowning in the middle of a lake, medication can get you out of the lake and into the rowboat. But it‚Äôs only counseling, DBT, etc that will teach you the skills to row the boat to shore.‚Äù 

If you feel like your symptoms are affecting your ability to generally live or complete basic tasks, it can help stabilize you, help you get to a point where you can put the work into therapy. 

If you‚Äôre mostly stable, maybe with some episodes here or there, but generally feel lost and struggling, good therapy can bring a lot of awareness to our behaviors in a way that‚Äôs life-changing. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy for 6+ years and still struggle often, but understanding myself and my impulses is one of the most powerful tools I could have ever asked for."
AskWomen,euky2ow,t3_cgqy2q,1563894555.0,"Sometimes it comes down to the littlest actions. When I have been in the lowest place ever, I kind of bargain with myself.

 ‚ÄúJust get out of bed and go turn on the shower. If you definitely need to turn around and get back into bed, that‚Äôs fine. But our goal is to go turn on the shower.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight now, I‚Äôm going to turn on my computer and open my email. If I don‚Äôt read or open a single one, that‚Äôs okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt this party, I‚Äôm going to talk to one person. Even if it‚Äôs a quick greeting. Then I can leave.‚Äù

Sometimes I only do that one task. But most of the time, the momentum and the reasonable expectation I set for myself makes it easier, and I‚Äôve often surprised myself with how much I accomplish. 

If you think about the gravity of all the things involved to do one task (get out of bed, get dressed, pack my bag, get in the car, etc...) it can get overwhelming real quick. So I give myself one, small first task to do. And if I totally give up after that, that‚Äôs okay.

We were together 3 years, then had a really messy break up last fall. Some toxic behavior patterns were coming up, and he was moving out of town which was putting a lot of stress on our tenuous relationship. 

Fast forward to a few months ago. We started talking again, going slowly, really fleshing everything out for the first time without walking on eggshells. We‚Äôve been traveling together since then, and it‚Äôs reaffirmed for me that he is truly my partner. When faced with difficulties, both individual and as a couple, that put us through the wringer and ended the relationship, through time and intention we‚Äôve managed to grow alongside each other, stronger and more intentional than ever. 

It makes me all weepy to even type it out, ugh. Learning how to be alone again after him was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve done, and when I came out the other side resilient, we were able to move forward and build a stronger relationship together. 

So, all that‚Äôs to say that this morning, we had the conversation we both knew was coming. What next? I‚Äôm applying to grad school and he‚Äôs job hunting, which could find us in a new apartment together or on opposite ends of the country. 

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot to discuss, but I want you to know I‚Äôm all about you right now. I know we can compromise and pursue what we want, together.‚Äù
