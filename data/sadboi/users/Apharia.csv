Hi,

I've lost about 20 pounds thus far and would like to lose a bit faster. I intake 1500 calories or less a day and workout for about 20 minutes of cardio a day(until it hurts). I was hoping to lose a little faster though as it took me months just to even get this far. I take meds that make it even harder. 

So I heard there are safe ways to lose 1 pound a week and was wondering if there was something I could do differently to achieve that goal. 

Thank you"
