u_Xiristatos,fl7qjzg,t3_fn5z6x,1584907252.0,"Yes... I just reuploaded this one again, but I had to do so because with everything edited and cleared up (and almost all the goddamn ties removed. The only three-way tie that remains is genuine, for Pokemon characters I really can't decide on whom I like the most), I don't believe I will feel the need to alter this one any longer. Sure, as is normal for many people, preferences change overtime, and even though I did make this a countdown of sorts, I am not too strict with specific rankings and such, which is how I felt it was rather simple to alter some spots without changing the entire thing.

But up until now, I felt a stronger sense of OCD in this one because of how I placed some characters... and of course those ties that ended up giving some separate spots less ""believeability"" (like Homura being above Madoka separately, but then two characters somewhere else sharing one spot), which I became annoyed by eventually. The only tie that remains is Number 41, the only genuine mixup I have and where I legitimately couldn't give the three separate spots, but I really do adore them all the same (and in the case of Klara, I adore her *already* even before her event has been fully released. She's that excellent to me).

Anyway, this should be it. Spectators, behold... and no more re-uploads of this shit."
u_Xiristatos,fkwtsy6,t3_fhkhs7,1584605505.0,"So I made yet another edit to my top thingy, and I absolutely won't bother making another upload JUST for this, so I will just leave the link to it right here: [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/OtiedGE.jpg)

As for why I did this: 

Fortunately for me, I don't have to feel conflicted whenever I solely replace a character in a spot with another one without editing the ranks of the others. This might seem like cheating because I'm too lazy to make bigger edits because of one change, and I won't blame anyone for thinking that (provided anyone gives a shit lol), but it's hilariously easy for me to change my mind on characters like that
While I prefer to represent my feelings in a ""countdown"" style manner, I am also not overly strict on any rankings, so to be truthful, I can just do with it whatever I like
And how I feel about a character isn't gonna be misconstrued because of how I operate
As for what those two spots are...

I do think that Sports Maxx is absolutely awesome, and easily one of my favorite JoJo villains, but once again, there's just too many of them that I find awesome as well, so in a way it can become difficult to decide. In a way, because of how I feel about JoJo characters in general, I start to think that having given Sports Maxx a spot like that may have been pushing it. I replaced him with that main antagonist from ""Just Shapes and Beats"", whom I find to be excellently portrayed in a game that has no dialogue whatsoever, and he just looks amazing with every move he does and pulls.

Then there's Star Butterfly. I still adore her quite an amount as well as her antics... for the most part, of course. But what I seem to have ignored is my own ""taste fatigue"" that could happen with some characters, and it depends on several factors. With Star here, it kind of comes with how fatigued I am toward the show in general... and I looked up the finale and stuff (because TV Tropes and wikia image galleries lol) and decided that I'm not a fan of the show anymore. Star and Marco I will still appreciate, but lately the fatigue has kicked in more and more, so she be go, too. I chose to ""bring back"" Magolor, who I've always been a fan of, especially in his debut time, but I kind of ignored that as well, which was quite shameful of me."

u_Xiristatos,fkbp99g,t3_fhkhs7,1584037247.0,"READ BEFORE EXPRESSING CONFUSION:

I felt like I had to semi-majorly update this little (not little) list of mine with some notable changes this time. I have my reasons for these specific edits.

Most importantly, and this is why I did this in the first place: I decided that determining ""rank spots"" for specific Pokémon was far more confusion-inducing than I previously imagined. 
Putting only three on this list (on two spots) absolutely doesn't portray at all how I feel about specific Pokémon.

There are just too many that I adore, and I realized (or rather, remembered) that they're honestly kind of similar to JoJo's Stands in a sense; they're just too much of an entirely different league on their own to talk about them completely separated. Now there are some Pokémon that happen to me outright characters in much the same way as the actual humans doing the important stuff, such as Ash's Pikachu or Team Rocket's Meowth, but while I like those two, they're not my personal Top 50 material...

The Number 46 spot that belonged to Alcremie and Hatterene has now been replaced by my three favorite Pokémon rivals... and for those of you who are inevitably wondering why on earth I'd already directly add Klara as a part of them when her event hasn't even been released yet, I don't blame you, but... she really has captivated me the *instant* I saw and knew anything about her. She really is one of those characters I'm seriously looking forward to with baited breath, because I *already* love every single thing about her. That being said, I felt it was most fitting to put those three here, because I do still take strong preference to Tim Curry Pollution, and those above him.

Then there's Number 23, which once belonged to Togekiss. Now it's Donkey Kong. Why? My daft head remembered... I absolutely love Donkey Kong, always did, always will. But again... daft Xiristatos. Conveniently, I still love characters like Monika and Thrax more, but my adoration for the king of the jungle should absolutely *never* dissipate like it briefly did.

Then there's Number 30, which actually has nothing to do with the aforementioned factor regarding Pokémon. Rather, it was Aran Ryan and Super Macho Man that were replaced by President Haltmann and Susie, for two reasons:
First, with the former two, something similar to the Pokémon thing became an issue, albeit on a smaller scale; there are also *way* too many characters from Punch Out that I really like, and it would also be overly chaotic to have like half of the entire roster as a spot on there... and also, with all that said, overtime I feel more and more that I just take stronger preference to all other characters on this list. 
That be me, Xiristatos... my interests being kinda like a roulette.

The second reason is that, similarly to Donkey Kong, I criminally forgot about how much I adore the Kirby franchise, and especially many of the characters in it. If my 2012-me created such a list, Magolor would have been on this list in a femtosecond, probably even Number 1... but then that changed significantly overtime, and even within the franchise, these two blue-eyed machine-enthused bobbleheads have endeared to me far, far more.

And then finally, for no other reason other than I just could and wanted to, I gave both Cioccolata and Secco a visual alteration. I just thought to myself ""that would make them look so much cooler"" and simply went with the idea.

And that's all. Time to ping and bring over the people who commented on the last version, so that they can see this shit."

depression,fdq8iwk,t1_fdpsanw,1578659238.0,"I seem to have caught on to that fact. I have also heard of people similar to your mother, who gaslight blatantly. It's pathetic as fuck. It would only naturally paint the idea in your head that *you* are in the wrong when that's not even slightly the case. You're not ""the crazy asshole"", you're the one being forced to endure an *actual* crazy asshole. You are every flavor of welcome, of course we would take your side here.

And I see nothing wrong with ""rambling"" a lot... I do it myself a lot, and it's true that it can be much, but as you said, it happens when we finally have the opportunity to vent about our repressed anger and shit memories without any unreliable piece of shit judging you for it. Use this subreddit to your advantage, rant all you desire, and people WILL respond to what you have to say and care for you. Just be honest to everyone and yourself at all times, which I can tell from here is something you have no reason NOT to.

I swear a lot... like, so much every day that it's become a primary part of my vocabulary. You may have gotten that impression of me due to the weirdly ""formal"" way I communicate, but depending on circumstances (which are severely common) I use not only swear words, but if I'm angry enough, I tend to become ""creative"" with whatever words I use to ""swear"" at something (I believe that just saying ""fuck shit fuck shit fuck shit"" is unfocused, all over the place and doesn't have much impact to it, but saying something like ""this rotten, drunk, aborted fecal matter"" is elaborate and extreme, so I prefer the latter). So no, you don't swear ""too much""... in fact, given your fuckass piece of shit upbringing, you don't swear *enough*.

Also, I despise the logic that ""an apology will resolve this issue"". I don't believe it does... just saying ""sorry"" doesn't cut it for me. You also can't just force an apology out of someone JUST for the sake of having an apology... in this case, it wouldn't even be genuine, the offender would just say ""sorry"" if they think they can get out of it THAT easily, no matter if they actually mean what they say. No, a REAL apology is something that comes naturally, where the offender ACTUALLY regrets what they did... but again, they shouldn't expect that to heal the wounds immediately, they should fucking better themselves. And even if a mistake gets repeated, if they at least have a believeable desire to improve, then that's what should be focused on.

I don't have to add more to that... your parents are radioactive skunk diarrhea spewed out of the hemmorrhoid infested rectum of a drunk redneck, and even that's putting it far too lightly. These wretched goatfuckers need to get the FUCK out of your life, forever. Family or not doesn't matter, wretched pieces of shit that make your life hell *are not family*. They're expendable medical trash.

As for that you're thinking of right now... I advise that you think about your decision *extremely carefully*. Only say it if you feel *absolutely* safe doing so... and I do mean ABSOLUTELY. If there is even a HINT of doubt or hesitation, pass... don't say it. You got that?
And you're right, just because someone is depressed or anything does NOT automatically excuse them doing genuinely horrible things. And with that, from what you just told me, you did *nothing wrong whatsoever*. You were just forced into this unfortunate and diarrhea-covered thermonuclear accident of a life, and it seems to have twisted your mind in such a way that you wrongly believed YOU were at fault for it...

But no, from the comments I've seen on your profile page, there's no way in hell that could be anywhere close to true. I'm glad you're starting to realize this more and more, and there are several more people right here that will listen to you. That shit this your parents do to you is gaslighting at its finest... or most rat-piss-covered, I don't know. And it's fucking ABUSE, don't let ANYONE tell you otherwise... the magnitude of something doesn't fucking matter, abuse is fucking abuse and it's fucking disgusting and infuriating as fuck, and people who do this should be ashamed and hanged by their fucking testicles if they refuse to change their ways.

depression,fdnvvrq,t1_fdlvehk,1578593905.0,"That is quite heavy... it's awful that you had to go through all of this. 
While what I seem to suffer from isn't identical to yours, I have definitely heard and read from people that did go through something to that same effect.

Being so drained of emotion that one would long for just about any emotion just to feel *something* is absolutely tragic, and it unfortunately is something that can result from such a long time of depression. It's an extreme form of apathy. As you said, your brain has gotten so used to feeling this way that such emotions like happiness will naturally feel that much more impactful... even the mere prospect of it.

I will admit that I myself am not fully sure of what's going on either. I definitely am not an expert in this area, but it's something that more than often will hit close to home for me, no matter where it may come from. What I said above feels like I was grasping at straws... I guess, I don't really feel all that confident about my intuition, whatever I have.

One thing I *can* tell you is that I can actually relate to how you feel, if on a different level.
With me, I actually can express emotions like happiness (through laughing strongly) fairly commonly, but being depressed or just goddamn tired of life itself is unfortunately MUCH more so. But the thing with me specifically is that I am paranoid as all hell... I constantly fear pissing off people I am associated with, I even always fear strangers who just look at me funny, because I end up immediately thinking that they want to harm me or something.

I'm not just paranoid, but I am a sort of ""chronic worst-case thinker"" who immediately paints the worst possible thing in my mind if something is so much as uncertain to me. I naturally strongly suspect my childhood experience (especially elementary school) to be at fault for this... I know this because when I was younger, I tended to be yelled at over even minor slights, and even *things I couldn't possibly have known were wrong*... by both parents and some teachers. I used to be a curious young boy, always looking forward to what awaited me tomorrow, but that changed.

There's more to this, but I would like not to distract from my point too much. Where I relate to you here the most is how strange the feeling of happiness feels to you due to how your mind got used to it... but a bit more differently. Sure, I CAN feel this way from time to time, more than I may pessimistically believe (such is me), but... it's so hard for me to keep it. I find it excruciatingly difficult to be able to actually *rest* and have my mind actually be at ease.

I have gotten used to being stressed so much that whenever there's a moment I'm actually happy, I ALWAYS at the back of my mind end up thinking that this is weird, and that there must be something ""behind"" it. My mind feels like the only ""neutral"" state it can stay in is constantly being worried or at unease... and it can be from any source, be it within my home, or me discovering some certain news or whatever. 

A major part of this is my family with which I still live with (I am 23 years old, by the way). They aren't horrible people by any stretch, but they're so exhausting to me. On a regular basis does someone start a fight with someone else over a minor slight (my father and younger brother being the most frequent offenders), and I despise the constant loud noise of a fucking bullshit argument. And they always complain about me not wanting to spend time with them, but never once consider that I don't want to, and that I find my time to be wasted with them... and that's just some of the basic occurences.

Legitimately the ONLY time I could feel close to truly at ease at home... is if my whole family is asleep while I'm awake, or they're just somewhere else entirely... where I prefer the latter by a wide margin, but just not here to stand in the way of whatever peace I strive for. I don't hate my family, I do care about them and their wellbeing... but I do feel that being at home with all 4 of them just ends up making me feel more drained, stressed out and just at unease in general with how they tend to behave... it sounds sick, I know, but this is how things really are for me.

So to summarize... no, I am confident that you're not alone in how you feel. Unfortunately, such experiences can be quite common, and in this subreddit in particular, you might be likely to stumble on another such a person with that kind of experience. What I told you now is just my own specific ""variation"" of this, but I do feel like what you told me just now hit close to home for me in any event. It's definitely a matter that should be treated in a case-by-case/person-to-person basis, but I do believe I've heard of experiences just like yours before... and my own does feel quite close to that.

I suppose this is all I can say at the moment. Thank you for reading this, if you have. If anything is uncertain to you, don't be afraid to ask."

ALL THAT aside, I guess there is a DAMN good reason to have attempted this:

To prematurely end V3, and that would have been something heavily appreciated by me, since I would've never had to end up seeing Chapter 4, where Miu died in the most aggressively stupid and childishly insultingly plot-convenient fuck-it-in-the-ass way I have ever fucking seen, to the point where with just about *every other death* in existence (even those really fucking stupid ones where someone inflates like a motherfucking balloon and explodes, what the fuck is always up with those?) will always make me utter, deep inside me; ""well, at least they weren't killed like Miu""... 

...and then to have *that* trial become the most shamelessly forced attempt at a ""heartbreaking moment"" that I have ever fucking seen, to the point where the other shamelessly emotionally manipulative (imo lol) death of Chiaki Danganronpa 3 would feel... 

...it would genuinely end up making me say ""well, it *could* have been slightly more blatantly emotionally manipulative""... no small feat in itself, to be honest. That death is also so shit to me that I could only damn it with ""faint praise"" like that... doesn't deserve hatred, since that's clearly what it wants from me.

Then again, this god-awful story of V3 that tested my patience for far longer than a full round of Monopoly played with a notorious real estate scammer and a mobster boss on death row *clearly* wanted me to feel the same for Chapter 4 (and almost the whole thing in general). To which I say, sure... sure it did piss me off, maybe in the way you intended, but it shouldn't once think that it has ""won"" or anything.

Because there's also no way in hell I will let the man ""win"" who kicked me in the shin, broke my glasses, urinated in that basket full of newborn kittens that I just found, ran away looking like Naruto who had an army of fire ants shoved up his ass, nailed a bunch of snails (lol, dat rhyme) all over my home exterior once I returned and rounded up everything with one final extensive stream of diarrhea on my car...

There's no way in hell I will congratulate that man just because he ""intended"" to do this. Just like I won't congratulate Kodaka for writing this storywriting equivalent of leftover jalapeno burrito diarrhea sprayed all over my face just because ""that was the point"" (~~though I guess I'd significantly prefer that latter over having my shins kicked, but that's not the point of my overblown excuse of a roast hueheueheueh~~)

To have *that* whole dumbass game end just like that and have Kirumi return to the people that desperately need her, because whoever that prime minister is or was, they're the most fucking moldy-sponge worthless excuse of a minister ever if they had to hand over his ASSIGNED DUTY to a maid (~~Oh I forgot, ""it could have been a complete lie entirely!!"", right? V3 is about as subtle at storywriting as a lit stick of dynamite up my arse~~)... but that would be an insult to moldy sponges, since *they can at least fulfill their fucking duties by themselves, even if poorly*. That prime minister can go get his scrotum stuck in a paper shredder, it would have basically the same effect for everyone, what with his fucking refusal to do his job.

So after *all* that said... I guess Himiko could have an actually justifiable reason for ending that moronic killing game with that idiotic gag of hers. 
Except that gag bored and annoyed me so strongly that death wasn't even in my mind anymore, and literally anything else could have been better than starting V3 in the first place for me.

I guess that's also why I wasted all this time shamelessly insulting ***6*** things before I even got to what I was going to say for Himiko. That's how fucking tedious her character was for me... I can't even shit on her right (not that I did anything right in the first place lol)

I mean, what did her actually excellent role in Chapter 3 bring? I guess a fair amount of time of me actually liking her... and her losing like *one* catchphrase, and then not too long after did I forget I actually liked her in the first place; that's how fucking bored I became... since, I already seem to have missed the point of these ""roasting threads"", even though that's like my first (and last) time here... That's how boring she is to me now, even after that god-awful gag was finally long behind me.

Yeah... there you go, my weak-ass attempt at ""roasting"" Himiko. Guess I can at least look at myself in that sweat-stained mirror of mine so I could remind myself that I managed to poorly insult 7 things in ONE pathetic wall of text... oh, I predictably insulted myself too, now it's 8.

Can I shallowly attempt one more?

depression,fcygjrr,t3_ejeyfi,1578079744.0,"I must admit that I tend to say something like that a lot... but while I can't provide genuine proof of my intent, I can only confidently say that when I say something, I mean what I say.
That being said, I do understand how implicitly awful such a line can feel, especially when worded or timed poorly, and *especially* when it's commonly said just so the one who said it can just stop right then and there, go away and feel good about themselves for having ""done something"". And yes, that's something that pisses me off a lot.

I guess it's because I'm someone who can feel extreme guilt and anxiety over just about *anything*, but there's no way in hell I can feel remotely good about half-assing an attempt to help someone, and just aborting it entirely... especially when that person hasn't felt remotely better at all. So when I actually do feel like I can't do anything to help, that I just admit to it... just complete honesty, even if it can be disappointing. I prefer honesty over false optimism.

While I feel like I have a strong sense of empathy deep inside, I never feel like I'm doing enough when I actually try to reach out to someone, and that can be worsened if I feel generally down or demotivated myself (something I'm feeling right now, as a matter of fact. But I can't ever just be like ""ok, I can't talk anymore, I've run out of things to say"" either, since that would only hurt more.

With that out, I absolutely never say ""You are not alone"" just for the sake of it; the only time I would ever utter those words is if I'm talking to friends and/or where I *know for absolute certain* that they aren't. But then again, I'm not really sure if that helps, either...

There's definitely a lot I have to learn of course, like accepting that no matter how hard I try, there's no guarantee that it will lead to a more positive outcome. Something like that should be treated on a case-by-case basis.

...I suppose this is all I can say at the moment. I was gonna come up with something actually purposeful for you, but I seem to suck at it, and as I pointed out, I'm not feeling very good myself, so... that can kinda bleed over into sucking a lot. Sorry for that."

danganronpa,fbnwr98,t3_edv99s,1577004227.0,"Personally, I think the reason for this apparent ""clash of logic"" might be because of how Hiyoko was treated in a ""cast dynamics"" sense, and for me, the scene at the beginning of Chapter 2 that many are referring to here immediately springs to mind as an example of this.

Now on the one hand, just on a base technical level, I think this makes a lot of sense for Mahiru's character; she puts higher standards on males than on females, which while it's sexism by definition (as u/ParkingContext brought up), doesn't mean she's an outright bad person or anything. 
She does mean well regardless, and I can easily see her defending someone like Hiyoko from a group of people calling her out on her odor... out of context, like just on its own, I see it as a believeable part on Mahiru wanting to defend someone who's ""outnumbered"". This can also work because she felt that Fuyuhiko was legitimately being threatening with what he said, so it made sense for her to call that out.

In context, it's fairly easy to see why this could be considered hypocritical entirely, but oddly enough, I entirely blame not only Hiyoko's writing and dynamics for that instead of Mahiru, I also see that as an example of why I find DR's dialog writing to be trash in general.

I have slightly warmed up to Hiyoko as a side note, but my biggest problem with Hiyoko even to this day is how almost no one reacts to *anything* she says. Genuinely the only reactions to her remarks that I could think of are Mikan ""EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK""ing all the time, Ibuki with her ""knife of truth"" thing (that I think her VA voiced quite badly, sadly) and Kazuichi having that one embarrasssing line in Chapter 1 that I'm too lazy to remember (something about ""I react better to praise"" or whatever), but then nothing else. Hiyoko's bullying feels like a ""sideshow"" to me that gets ignored very quickly, like not directly by the characters or anything, but by no one and nothing having any reaction afterwards (and I swear, *even Mahiru* counts among those), only these painfully awkward reactions I already mentioned.

Legitimately, it feels to me like because Hiyoko's bullying is this much of a sideshow, I'd say the whole ""Mahiru defense"" scene feels more like I was supposed to forget Hiyoko's bullying even happened. No, I don't mean that I feel like I had to forgive her bullying, no, but I can *only* believe that scene to make any logical sense if Hiyoko's bullying moments were to be *taken out entirely*, because literally no character EVER brought up any examples of Hiyoko ""being mean"", hell, no one even really objects to Mahiru being defensive over Hiyoko if I recall correctly. And if only I recall correctly, this thought of mine is also supported by *Mikan or Kazuichi not even being bullied by Hiyoko there to begin with*. The one thing she did was aggressively remark on how Teruteru deserves to be hated for what he did, which wasn't any of her typical ""sideshow bullying"" as I call it now, but feels to me like a believeable example of Hiyoko's actual depth by giving her a unique mindset (that no matter what intention, murder is the worst. At least what I can take away).

I do still consider it fair for people to believe this to be hypocrisy on Mahiru's part, it is quite easy to take it away as such, but I don't think Mahiru really did anything wrong... I believe it was just an unfortunate set of circumstances that came to be due to another character's ""blatant lack of comeuppance"" that made it kinda hard to take in.

And honestly, while I do really like Mahiru wanting to form a friendship with Hiyoko and the latter respecting that, a lot, I just think that that should have happened at a different circumstance than this... because honestly, I think the only thing one has to do to make Mahiru's ""defense scene"" *completely* believeable and respectable on her part without what I brought up previously to even be a problem is for Hiyoko to be replaced entirely here... my first thought would be Mikan. She seems like a perfect fit for being defended by Mahiru in my eyes. And I don't even like Mikan any more or less than Hiyoko nowadays.

That's what I can take away from this exaggerated example of double standard; merely a result of unfortunately positioned characters due to horrible writing on another character's part. Now as I made clear prior, Mahiru's general strictness of males over females is an important part of her character, but here I feel like it was taken unbelieveably too far (something I actually have a problem with many things in Danganronpa, funnily enough)... which is what would eventually end up spawning memes such as this.

And yes, I KNOW there's also different cultural aspects, and the original Japanese version to take into account, but I'm not the type to do that, I strictly look at what version we have right here... but taking it into account, I could theorize that it might possibly be a cause as to why that scene felt so poorly ""constructed"" to me. They must have edited the dialog without being able to alter when someone or who is going to speak... I'm not entirely sure on this, but I will take this as a possibility.

That is the only way I can semi-forgive what I still largely see as horrible writing, and much less ""Mahiru being a mega-hypocritical bitch who only defends bitches""... like, *MUCH MUCH* less. Either way, I can't be asked to see this scene as an example of Mahiru being... the above term in the same paragraph, because I can't believe it whatsoever... moreso, I see that scene as a result of insanely bad cast integration and dynamics, nothing more or less than that.

Same for the way Hiyoko's bullying is treated in general, really."
danganronpa,fblviuh,t1_fblny7d,1576971384.0,"That's a good example, too. Though I went for an even broader direction with what I said there; For example, if a character appeals to you simply because you find their personality and quirks to be endearing, or even relatable, it could get to a point where while you acknowledge that you have problems with their story integration and stuff, you love their personality so much that it doesn't matter much to you in the end.
Or for another example, a character could have depth that you personally find endearing and find that it connects well with the character, but perhaps said depth isn't explained more, or isn't even integrated into the story enough, but if you like that depth regardless, especially if you feel like it already makes you appreciate the character more, then that's all that matters in the end.

There's even more of these, but the point is the same; if you disagree with someone on something, keep it civil, because that person simply sees something you don't. And that's okay.

As for your last paragraph, I think I should have known better and earlier that it was more of a vent than anything, but I wasn't able to tell that because it was still so ""levelheaded"", like I didn't feel much passive aggressiveness, if any. 
But I do agree with what you say, I have seen people like this a fair amount, and being accused of hypocrisy like this can be a stressful experience, to say the least. It's like only one wrong step away from feeling like outright ad-hominem if ""broad"" enough.

Now to be fair, as I brought up above and in my last comment, it is still just as valid to have an opinion of a character even if you mostly base this on a singular aspect... after all, ""being mean"" is still something you describe as a personality. Like for example, you can find ""characters who are hyperactive"" to be generally annoying; it's based on a trait, yes, but you don't like the archetype in general, enough that it won't make you like the rest of the character. That does exist, and while it can feel ""simple-minded"" from an outsider perspective, it's still a valid opinion to have, formed by oneself and their own thought process, and they could feel this way even if they know of everything else the character has to offer, and choose to stick with their initial view. Doesn't have to mean they won't listen to discussion around the character, let alone refuse to even acknowledge what else the character has to offer, but ultimately trait-based opinions can still be just as valid.

I myself, however, do consider a character for more beyond the archetype, and I prefer to focus more on what's done with the trait, even if it's one I generally don't like. I'm not usually a fan of the ""overly confident support who keeps failing at being a support"" type, but Kaito is my 4th favorite DR character for just how well I found him to be presented. Inversely, while I generally really like ""stoic characters who are actually scared deep inside and just repress their emotions or try to cope"", I generally really dislike Himiko for feeling far too stubborn with her ""it's magic"" thing to the point of actual annoyance.

Just making this clear; there's nothing wrong with having even a ""singular-minded"" opinion on something. But being accused of hypocrisy over it is a different story entirely. I do agree with you that, no matter what, being treated in such a way *is* harmfully simple-minded towards the other person. I will respect opinions no matter what, but I will draw the line at hostility, or even passive-aggressiveness towards another person just for having a different opinion.

Anyway, just wanted to put that out there, though I guess I went on a tangent there..."
danganronpa,fbldfn4,t1_fbl1j2m,1576961404.0,"Ah... a mistake. I have to look into that. Also, it's true, your idea right there feels like it would make for much better meta because it allows for potential to *directly* address the prominence of a ""creator's favorite"".

And please, don't ever think that I would make even a slight fuss about you being a Himiko fan. For one, I can absolutely see why someone would adore Himiko, but even if I didn't, I would never judge anyone for liking her (same with me for anything ever, you know) regardless. She's just a character that irritates me personally. 

To add, just because I ""can't see what others see"" in something doesn't automatically mean I intend to be rude or anything. It only comes down to how one voices that (like, don't go all ""how can people like this character?"", that's shit), but generally speaking, it merely is an admission that we don't see eye-to-eye... and we already established how that's a completely and perfectly acceptable thing."
danganronpa,fbkkr95,t3_edra5e,1576951861.0,"How interesting... for me to be namedropped in something even more than a year later.

Either way, this was an excellent writeup. You laid out your opinion very much elaborately and I was able to understand your perspective entirely.
For the most part, I do agree with your points myself, though nowadays, my opinion on Hiyoko has warmed at least notably. I don't really hate her anymore, I think she has genuine merit and ""flavor"" to her, enough for me to be invested in her character, but that being said, the majority of my previous writing issues with her stand... *especially* the one you brought up in my name. That will always be my ""signature problem"" with her.

One thing I would like to bring up specifically here, however, is the ""what we have versus what we could have had"" thing (or hell, the last paragraph in general).

I do unmistakably agree on the importance of *differentiating* between the two, especially when you actively *want* to talk about a character's actual writing. But at the same time, I see nothing wrong whatsoever in liking/disliking a character/story/etc. even based on ""could have"" aspects... it's still opinion after all, and that can go a long way, and how one person or another values certain aspects in general can vary wildly, to say the *least.*

You could consider a character to have flawed writing in practice, but you can still heavily appreciate the attempt and intention behind it enough to still enjoy a character, or just have ""headcanons"" that make you more invested in them. I think ""investment"" is a very important word to use here. It's what matters the most *to me*; for example, I consider Mahiru to be a flawed character in writing and story integration (and I also agree with a fair amount of your points on her here), but she's a character that still has me heavily invested in her, and I absolutely adore all the side content with her. It's enough to make up for the problems I otherwise have, and still be able to love her all the same.

Of course, I can't speak for everyone here (nor do I intend to), but I think ""greatness"" doesn't mean there to just be no flaws whatsoever... moreso, it's about how we're able to take flaws and how much they will impact us, and whether or not we feel the positives make up for the problems we have. It's less about quantity, and more about its ""quality"".

For one other major example on my part, I consider V3's story to be one of the worst things ever... in terms of storywriting and character dynamics/cast integration, few things piss me off more than how things were handled there... but I actually adore most of the cast, and three of them are in my Top 3 outright (Korekiyo, Miu and Gonta), but of course, this is mostly *in spite* of my problems with how they were handled. I still love their characters and many individual things about them, while at the same time feeling like they were handled awfully in aspects (except for Korekiyo, who I felt singlehandedly made Chapter 3 my favorite chapter in the whole game... and the only one I actually liked towards the end). Simultaneously, in it, Kokichi is easily my least favorite main character, and though I can see genuine merit in him, he's very much responsible for (and the very front-face of) most of the problems I have with V3, enough for even the positives I had with him not to make up for the negatives.

In the end, what matters is how we just *feel* about a character in general. Sometimes we can't even explain it at all, we just see something that draws us toward it just like that. Sure, one can *try* comprehending it, but it really shouldn't be *required* to have concrete reasons to be able to like/dislike something, let alone justifications. Emotions are a very important part about us, it's what makes us so individual and alive, and many times can you just *not* explain it whatsoever... same can apply to fictional media. We shouldn't feel restricted in our passion for a character *just* because there's a flaw in them, even if it *does* bother us. Same goes for vice versa, in disliking a character.

This is one thing I end up seeing in those who love and adore Hiyoko despite (or fuck, even **in spite** of) the problems they have with her, and that same thing can apply to just about everything else.

But of course, I'm still mostly in agreement of your writeup. Still a good one."
danganronpa,fbk9lh3,t3_edqnbs,1576946912.0,"This was quite a fun read, though maybe it's because I'm a ""new paragraph after every fucking sentence"" kind of guy, but I guess massive blocks of text don't usually motivate me to go along... but I managed to pull it off fairly well here.

However, you should not disprove someone else because you don't see the same things they do, that's just being rude and kind of a jerk.

This has always been my biggest problem with these chapters; in fact, the only reason DR1's final chapter is the only one I almost legitimately like is because of the entire >!Mukuro/Junko reveal!< first half of the trial *before* the apparent ""climax"" of it.

> I don't remember it exactly, but there was a moment where Shuichi apparently realised ""Do you want to die"" was said in a joking manner, and it wasn't, there was no joke to that. More ham-fisted ""friendship"" to make the twist hurt more.

No, it is exactly as you remembered it. Maki tells this to Shuichi with her smile expression sprite, which lead Shuichi to think this in response.
It's funny, lately I've grown to actually really like Maki, mostly for her pleasant appearance and her more collected behavior that makes her feel more ""credible"", even with her ""assassin"" personality post-chapter 2, but even to this day my problems with her story and dynamics integration remain.

May seem confusing as to why I think this, but nowadays I consider V3's story and dynamics to be such a trainwreck (with a casualty) to such a level, that it has gotten to the point where barring *only* Kaito (and maybe Tenko, by virtue of Chapter 3 being the only chapter I ever liked in this shit), whenever I like or even love a character from it, almost always will it be **in spite** of how they're integrated into the story and cast. 

And this is funny in itself because I actually like *the majority* of its cast (Korekiyo, Miu and Gonta are my Top 3 DR characters ever, respectively. Rantaro and Himiko are the *only* characters I mostly dislike, while Keebo and Kokichi are the only characters I strongly dislike outright)

Shit, that went off the rails really fast.

> It would had been a bigger and more effective twist if MAKI was the mastermind and Tsumugi was a red-herring, but that's neither here or there.

Honestly, I would have *loved* to see such a thing... I mean it, with how often Maki gets praised by the characters no matter what she does, eats, breathes or even burps, I feel like this could have been an *actual* working twist in the meta-sense... the character to turn out to have controlled the killing game being the obvious creator's favorite? That could work greatly, if you asked me.

> First of all, it abandons the Golfer Project plotline

Minor grammatical error; it's called ""Gofer Project""

Not that I care about it either or anything, but I am quite intense with grammar and shit... felt like pointing that out because of this.

> Now, it's important to preface this with the fact that, everyone takes their own things away from media. Which is perfectly acceptable and in fact I encourage it, see things the way you want to see them. However, you should not disprove someone else because you don't see the same things they do, that's just being rude and kind of a jerk.

I absolutely agree with this statement, thanks for making it exist with your keyboard. 

Seriously, after seeing such ***simple*** civility abandoned so many times, I must ask: What's so difficult about this? To just move on if someone *still* disagrees with you no matter how many times you stubbornly try to hammer your own opinion in them (I don't mean having longer discussions and interactions in general, I mean these endless arguments with the primary (or only) goal of changing someone's opinion and then not relenting until ""the argument is won"")?

I wouldn't even be this mad about this if **both** sides of an argument were actually clear about what they were doing... or more importantly, if both sides made sure that the other person they responded to even *wanted* to have an outright argument to begin with. But no, I've seen a lot of examples of unwanted heated debates happen due to someone being needlessly pressurized and even interrogated **just** for having an opinion someone else just didn't agree with, which would be followed by the former naturally ""fighting back"" as a result... it's a stupid vicious cycle.

Whether or not something is a ""fact"" or not shouldn't really matter; people can make up their own minds as to what's ""right or wrong"" (And for many things, the concept of ""right or wrong"" is actually kind of fruitless with fictional media, which has subjective stuff all over the place), and while discussion with other people is of course a good thing and I absolutely encourage that (and yes, even *tonally* aggressive opinions are fair game), there just has to be this aura of civility and respecting the other's perspective in order for your discussion to end up peacefully... and you know, *all sides involved actually consenting to it*. 

Being stubborn and forceful in such a matter is bound to be annoying no matter what.
I don't understand what's behind this desperate desire in someone to change someone else's opinion (especially forcibly) just for their own satisfaction... hell, I ask myself as to what even *is* the actual aim in being like this? I don't see this as ""healthy discussion"" in any way... I just find it annoying as all fuck.

...sorry, got carried away again, but goddamn.

> I also want to say that while this wasn't the intent, that doesn't make it feel any less like the case. I shouldn't have to turn to interviews in order to see how I should feel. When you create a piece of media, you have to think about the impactions and accept that people won't see eye to eye on certain things

With everything I said above, I absolutely agree with this as well; authorial intent shouldn't automatically mean more or less than the audience's view. There's a reason the trope ""Death of the Author"" is a thing.

Yes, what the author has created is obviously what's visible infront of you, but when it comes to intent and implications, the results and reactions are bound to be different with the audience. And with V3 specifically, it pisses me off that the author's intent of what's behind this shit can only be deciphered through relying on secondary material, like interviews or even artbooks... and more likely than not did I end up not liking what I saw. And also, because the actual damn story itself won't make things any more clear to me, which while I love finding out things myself and analyzing details on my own accord (hell, this is how I've come to appreciate several Danganronpa characters even more, like Korekiyo, Teruteru or Miu), there comes a point where this constant uncertainty actually becomes bothersome... if not insufferable entirely.

I'm not shitting on anyone when I say that Chapter 3 aside, UTDP and Love Across the Universe are the **only** events I actually unironically like in V3, and as far as I'm concerned, they're my only headcanons. Fuck the main story with a radioactive element.

> I play games to get transported to a new world, to travel to new locals and met characters and I can grow attached to. Telling me that they all didn't exist, like that, felt like it didn't matter. Why should I care about it since the in-universe fans are clearly insane and totally not an representation for the fans, which is totally not sarcasm there.

While I actually do like the moral that resulted during this trial, this right here is possibly the biggest reason I resorted to ""fanon discontinuation"" here. There is no way I would ever remain invested in a media if it does shit like this... and besides, these are *fictional characters already*, so all the writing and presentation around them still applies no less... I don't feel like handwaving genuine writing flaws like this will automatically excuse it.

> I also found the whole ordeal with the ending the game to not matter, since they live anyway, which is basically a fuck you to those who think that they should had died to give it a bigger impact and to make the message stick more and it doesn't do anything to the people who dislike the ending. I've heard people go on to say that even though they liked V3-6's twist, they hated the epilogue and I can't blame them.

I just saw the epilogue as one final appropriate mistake (or rather, a middle finger of a mistake) for this piece of shit story. Nothing more, nothing less.

> I would also like to say that the fact that Kaede didn't kill Tsumugi is supposed to be an emotional moment, but she still did try to kill someone and at this point I didn't care.

Seems like a little character name typo there... also, I agree with you there as well. I felt this twist was entirely unnecessary and only existed to make the player feel even worse.

Which is entirely okay, of course. As I said (in great, unnecessary detail above), being tonally aggressive is alright, and I think it can give your writing some ""personality"" as well... as long as you remain respectful of what other people may feel, as well as accept the fact that people won't automatically see eye-to-eye and that there's no point in stubbornly trying to change someone's opinion through force, or just not relenting.

Something that *you* made perfectly clear, so you're perfectly fine in my book."

Yes, for being a complete Harem story by design (something I'm generally not too much a fan of), this one got me surprisingly deeply invested, and that insanely quickly as well (It took me a mere first glance at Nino (followed by the other quintuplets) to get me into it). The whole time I felt that the progressing relationships between each character was down to earth and natural, which made me able to appreciate each character on their own merit. Unlike with other entires of this genre (what few I've actually seen), there was not a single moment where I was even slightly angered by whatever was going on. As I said, it's... that simple, mild down-to-earth factor that helps here.

I admit that I only caught wind of this >!bride reveal!< only recently through this subreddit (I don't really mind spoilers all that much), so I haven't actually read up to this point to know what the details are, but I think I should be aware of the topic at hand. And to be quite honest, >!while Nino has always been my favorite quintuplet from the very beginning, I never really expected or ""demanded"" that she become the bride... I never had any such thought, I was going to be happy with any quintuplet getting that position, but I will admit that having Yotsuba become the one was still comparably delightful, partially because she's my *second* favorite quintuplet, but mostly because I felt that her becoming the bride was most appropriate (among many other things, the photo of young Fuutaro and Yotsuba comes to mind)!<

I'm not really a ""shipper"" type myself, at least for the most part. ""Two individuals loving and caring for eachother"" is genuinely the only ""requirement"" for me to appreciate whatever you have in store, provided you do it (or at least try your best to) in a healthy, believeable and ""down-to-earth"" manner...

danganronpa,f7ula2l,t1_f7ujeya,1574015770.0,"By ""forcing into an argument"" I am referring to what you just said with ""being harrassed for thinking differently"", I just seem to have worded it a bit incorrectly. In my experience, whenever I feel backed into a corner because someone decided to be confrontational towards my opinion, I feel like I have to instinctively strike back because I feel invalidated at the moment. But again, that's just me. I don't find it very easy to just back out.

And my experience with toxicity has been kind of different... no, I haven't really seen examples of ""people being toxic by not engaging in discussion"" all that much compared to just... people lashing out at opinions they disagree with.

I do absolutely agree with everything else you've said, like with the aforementioned ""harrassing people"" and the latter part about people being muted... that's something that should never happen to people. Silencing others just for their opinions is reprehensible.

Having a pleasant discussion involves people sharing their opinions and presenting them to the others, and if they're convinced by it, then that's something they themselves chose to do. Your opinion was just convincing to them. You should never *force* people to be convinced if you don't want them to feel invalidated.

I can't speak for everyone here of course... I see where you're coming from, absolutely, discussion is absolutely fun, and can come in many different ways, but only if everyone involved is in on it, and no one should *force* someone into an argument they don't want to be in, only to act like a dick and invalidate the opinions of others just because they disagree with it."

Thank you, I also need this. I always feel like I'm doing something fucking wrong."
depression,f7nc3d0,t1_f7mo586,1573894796.0,"I have saved your comment, because this is something I genuinely want and need to remember in the future. I'm someone that genuinely loves helping out (or at the very least try helping them out) someone that I can tell feels sad or burdened about something, because I can't just sit there and leave the person like that, there has to be *someone* willing to do or say something. I am however quite self-conscious about my ability in that, or whether or not I'm even doing the right thing.

Yes, I do instinctively try to give advice because that's the first thing in my mind... but yes, it's not something someone *always* wants to hear. To really want to help out a person, you have to kind of ""insert"" yourself in them and acknowledge how *they* feel in the moment. I try this a lot, but I do admittedly fall into some of the traps you and some others here have brought up.

It's true, I do say ""I know how you feel"" at the very beginning *a lot...* because it genuinely is the very first thing in my mind, because I think it's true whenever I read something someone has said. It does feel patronizing, I absolutely agree, but it just kinda comes out like that... I do however try starting a conversation that does include things about myself, because I feel like it can give the other person something else to think about in the moment, and let them know that there's someone genuinely willing to talk to them.

I also instinctively say something like ""you can always talk to me""... and even though I *do* absolutely mean it when I say it, I can see how it can cause more troubled feelings in eachother... like what you brought up about feeling like a burden (though I do remind them that they aren't and that I would say so if it was). 

But then there's also myself, where I usually don't want to realize that maybe I'm doing too much and that I'm just kinda turning myself into an emotional punching bag for the other person at some point... like, I can take that a lot, but then that's because I don't take care of myself and have a severe inability to say ""no"" because I can't stand the thought of disappointing or letting down someone I care about. So I prefer just being the emotional punching bag, because I have no reason to be unhappy if the other person can feel at least somewhat better afterwards.
I do however still know my limits, and while I almost always feel shameful about it, if I simply don't know what to say or do, then I will at least leave behind a message like what u/Heartdrifts brought up; ""I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I wish there was something I could say to help you""... I do still know that saying nothing is better than saying the wrong or meaningless thing.

There's... a lot more to bring up, but I am not sure where to even start, so I leave it at that... just thanks for your comment. I really do need it for future reference, because I do always feel like I'm not doing something right, even though I genuinely want to show that other person that someone cares about them."

I myself have some of the greatest friends I have ever met in a long time, and that in a ""closed community"" online, and the respect, appreciation and compassion I give to others is even given back to me by many, undoubtedly.

At the same time, I'm a paranoid fuck and at almost all times do I have these self-destructive thoughts like said community actually hating me and wanting me gone forever, and they just don't want to admit it to me. 

Just like you, I *know* I have true friends and there's no mistaking it in reality, but I constantly have these horrifying voices in my head (*especially* when I'm stressed or pissed off, which is almost always) that paint the absolute worst kind of picture for myself or how I see others, to the point where these images feel vivid, as if they're a reality about to happen.

And I'm socially reclusive and generally introverted myself most of the time, but then when I'm within a group of people or colleagues or (in the case of an online community on Discord) friends, I suddenly am so extroverted and outright speak my mind.

But then... yeah, this same kind of thing happens even there, and it can make me feel incredibly awful. At first, I thought it was weird... if I am already introverted usually and love being alone, why am I suddenly so upset when a circumstance happens in which I actually end up being alone?

It took me a strange amount of time, but I think I've realized it... it's not about being alone in the first place, it's more that being in a group of people that makes you *feel* alone that really hurts. The feeling of being left out... that's what really hurts here, and I am genuinely relieved that I'm not ""the only one"" who feels this same way when I read this... on top of that, I am *incredibly* sensitive to ""speed"", and can lose my composure very quickly if a conversation/chat goes on for too fast among multiple people... that just makes things worse for me, though I'm not sure if you feel the same way.

But always remember that this is almost *never* because of any ill-intent on your friends' part. They just happen to have an investment in something that you do not, or they just generally become more talkative among themselves. They're still your friends after all, and if you let them know of how you feel, then they should hopefully be understanding."
