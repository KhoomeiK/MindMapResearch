That’s what I’m getting at. This situation will spiral if it’s not regulated."
AmItheAsshole,fn30nm1,t3_fyy4ux,1586609662.0,"NTA.

My sister-in-law also raises her sons with YouTube videos. Both of the boys have smart TVs in their room with no parental controls and iPads that are constantly blaring YouTube videos with dirty language at the loudest level. They also live two hours a way. My fiancé and I decided to no longer drive to visit them when his parents do.

As a result of the bad language and violence, the younger one (6) hits and curses when he doesn’t get his way. (For example: If he asks me for a soda and I say, “no you already have one open” he’ll hit me)

The older one (just turned 10) has already been caught messaging people masquerading as young girls. 

and yet, his mother still lets him have unadulterated access to the internet.

So I say NTA. Sure, what you said was a little harsh, but if that’s the wake up call your daughter needs to hear, then so be it. 
In the long run your grandchild will suffer from his inability to properly share his emotions and thinking the violence and cussing he witnesses is normal behavior. He is a formative, young child who needs someone to show him what acceptable behavior is.
