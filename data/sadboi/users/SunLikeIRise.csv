I know from my own experience that it's SO frustrating to feel so anxious and it's easy to beat yourself up over it. Try to not let those thoughts get to you! Being anxious is a natural feeling and being down on yourself for feeling anxious is not only unproductive but it can be your worst enemy!"
Anxiety,fr084vf,t3_gltufo,1589786695.0,"Well, first of all,  anxiety over getting a new job is a completely normal way to feel! Even people who don't suffer from high levels of anxiety on the regular would likely feel stressed by getting a new job. It can be intimidating to find yourself in a new place, surrounded by new people, and learning a new skill set all at the same time. The same thing goes for interviews and job hunting in general - I'd be much more surprised if someone said they *weren't* anxious about it! 

I think that's perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind when facing these worries too - everybody you encounter in a workplace was once new to the job too. The person interviewing you was once interviewed too, and likely felt the same nerves you're feeling. 

 I remember interviewing at the last place I worked and being so freaked out that I was going to say something stupid...and then getting hired and being worried sick everyone was going to be annoyed with me or judge me for being unknowledgeable. But the biggest factor in conquering anxiety of unfamiliar territory is repetition, and over time by doing those things I feared I was able to gain confidence in myself by proving I was capable of facing any fears and learning from any mistakes. 

By the end of my time there, I found myself being the one giving interviews to potential new employees and training the ones we hired. I ended up learning that not only is the interviewer likely as uncomfortable as the interviewee (interviews are just kinda awkward for everyone involved) but that anxiety in an interviewee/ new hire is both anticipated and oftentimes taken as a good thing because it meant that person cared a lot about doing well and was likely to become a great employee after they'd had a chance to get familiar with the job!

I also have bad anxiety and and I completely understand where you're coming from, but ultimately if you don't put yourself out there you won't be able to prove to yourself that you're totally capable of meeting and conquering any fears you have. You got this! If my panic attack having, self-doubting, nervous wreck self can do it, you can too. :)"

Anxiety,fpqplgl,t1_fppji50,1588828640.0,"Same here - while anxiety makes a lot of things difficult for me, driving is the thing it's affected the most hands down. It was one of those things where I was so afraid that I would make a mistake and injure other people that it kept me from learning to drive. And then not driving made me more nervous to drive because I was inexperienced and therefore more likely to make a mistake. And it kept going like that until it became a full on phobia, I couldn't get behind the wheel of a car without getting tunnel vision and having a panic attack. I'm now 27 and finally, just recently, had a moment that allowed me to start working through that fear and start driving.

I wish I had been at this point sooner, it would have saved me so much heartache over the years. I could have had so much more freedom! Could have found a better place to live! Could have gotten a better job! Could have gone to a better college! Could have attended more fun events and made more friends! 

If I could help just one person avoid the mistake I made by letting that fear win and discourage me from trying, I'd be so happy! People make mistakes. But the fact that you're nervous about making mistakes in this case can actually be a huge asset to being the safest driver possible...and, of course, it's worth mentioning that with the safety features in modern cars, even in the unlikely case a mistake did happen that causes a wreck, the chances are that you and your passengers would be okay."

I've never understood why some people are so against the throwback Poms, it's just that much more dog to love after all!

I did some looking into it, and from what I understood the huge Poms are a sort of genetic mutation - since they're bred down from the larger Spitz breed, occasionally a puppy will be born with a ""Throwback"" to the larger dogs they were bred from way back in their ancestry, and oftentimes it's parents and litter mates are all the ""normal"" tiny size you usually see in purebred Poms! This is apparently also why they're so often abandoned - as puppies they look like a standard Pom, and when they grow to be two or three times the size that they were expected to be, people will (very sadly) abandon them. But, of course, I am neither a genetic scientist nor a dog breeder so that's all to be taken with a grain of salt, just what I've found from snooping around online. :)"
Anxiety,fpcac4v,t1_fpc92gt,1588493113.0,"Hey, no problem. :)
Also if you're a visual thinker like me, It's worth looking in to guided meditation visualizations. You can find all sorts of them for free on YouTube to try out - having a calming visual narrative helps keep my imagination busy for a bit so it can't keep up the million mile an hour over-thinking parade of anxiety that it tends to get caught up in. Worst case scenario, they're not your thing and you wasted 10 minutes listening to someone describe walking through a forest in a slow soothing voice."
Anxiety,fpc6tzi,t3_gcjuj6,1588489562.0,"Obviously what works for me may not work for you, but my approach is pretty much making lists and playing a game I call ""Now, or Later?""

Making lists is pretty straight forward - I'll write out the things that most need to be done and cross them off as they're finished. It helps me stay on track and not procrastinate the anxiety inducing things by being productive on non anxiety inducing things (""Oh I'll file taxes tomorrow, organizing my closet took all day. Whoops!"") And adds some nice positive reinforcement when you get to actually see yourself working through the list. 

""Now or Later?"" Is this - I'll ask myself about each task ""What is holding me back from doing this task right *now* and what are the consequences of doing it *later* instead?"" 
It works for me because the answer to the ""now"" is always abstract fear (""What IF they get mad at me?"") And the ""later"" is always concrete consequences (""If I don't have this difficult conversation, my problems will never be addressed, and my relationship/job WILL suffer."") And it helps give me a push to get whatever it is over with for the sake of avoiding the far worse unpleasantness later on. 

I hope that's helpful to you! And, hey, even if it's not, congratulations on being proactive about identifying your weaknesses and tackling them head on. I know it's not an easy thing to do!"
Anxiety,fpc53nb,t3_gcjofz,1588487896.0,"  First of all I absolutely relate to this. More often than not this is how my anxiety hits me - I'm having a perfectly lovely and day and BAM out of nowhere my mind is going a million miles a minute and I feel my mood completely shifting.

  Sudden anxiety can feel really heavy and weirdly permanent like...""Even though I didn't feel this way five minutes ago now it feels like I'm going to feel this way *forever*"" so something  that has helped me was part of my meditation/mindfulness app I use- they use the analogy that anxiety can be like storm clouds. You're feeling great and the sky is clear and blue, and suddenly these clouds of anxiety move in and make everything dark and chaotic. But it's important to remember that the clouds don't make that clear sky disappear, they just cover it momentarily. I've found that just the thought that the storm isn't going to last forever, that my ability to return to a good mood  is still there even though those clouds came in out of nowhere, helps me get past them sometimes.   Maybe it sounds a little corny but hey, it helps me so I figured it was worth mentioning."
