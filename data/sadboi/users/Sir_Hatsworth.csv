I do some amature production in a similar sized room and isn't treated it at all yet apart from having carpet floors. As for production is most of your work done using samples and soft synths? I could imagine DnB would be a great use case for some outboard synths or even modular.

I also don't have a sub and honestly don't think they are necessary when using 8"" speakers in a room that size, especially if you pair your speakers with some headphones that offer a different soundstage."
