There's nothing wrong with providing people who have lost their jobs due to government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic with some relief. But offering $600 bonuses through January 2021 would discourage workers from finding new jobs throughout the beginning stages of our economic recovery by paying them as much or, in many cases, more than what they earned in wages prior to the pandemic.

Just obsessed with that extra $600."
