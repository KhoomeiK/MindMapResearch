virgin,fo5f9v4,t1_fnwmpqd,1587524237.0,On a dating app! I still can‚Äôt believe I had follow through with a match
virgin,fnvdu1a,t1_fj6h89p,1587289562.0,Update: wow you were right.
sex,fnvdibe,t3_g402w0,1587289207.0,"Literally a guy who is sweet, attentive, and respects me turns me on.

Unsolicited dick pics and badgering for sex is a whole turn off. But you can‚Äôt tell men that. They take offense if you tell them that. Then they find another woman to harass."
virgin,fnvd0yv,t1_fnprcui,1587288683.0,Thank you üò≠
virgin,fnvd0n4,t1_fnti2t9,1587288673.0,"We met in a dating app a few months back. We realized we didn‚Äôt live far from eacother, planned to meet, and it just happened. He mentioned things he wanted to do to me and he definitely did those things lol"
virgin,fnvcyup,t1_fntc898,1587288619.0,"Well I can‚Äôt say it was the most romantic but it was nice. He just happened to be a sweet guy with a large backseat lol. We made out (my first kiss also), he put me on top of him and it just progressed from there. There were other activities too. Lol"
virgin,fnvcur2,t1_fnqw7d3,1587288495.0,"You‚Äôre so sweet. Honestly I would love to stay. I‚Äôm still a late bloomer at heart and that mentality will probably stick with me for a while. A little advice though, the guy I did it with, I didn‚Äôt make my virginity a ‚Äúthing‚Äù. I also initiated the sex talk myself, letting it be known that I wanted it."
virgin,fnvcr54,t1_fnpwadl,1587288385.0,"We‚Äôve been talking on a dating app for months, realized we didn‚Äôt live far. The conversation shifted and we decided to meet up. And boom. Lol"
virgin,fnvcotx,t1_fnp3v2m,1587288315.0,Honestly I‚Äôm not sure if it will be with this guy. Either way I don‚Äôt mind. But after doing this I realize I would prefer a steady partner. And thank you!!üíú
virgin,fnvcmtr,t1_fnojx7n,1587288255.0,"For now, realize that your current feelings are valid. Don‚Äôt let anyone make you feel bad for wanting to lose your virginity or make you feel bad for being a virgin. Also, believe it or not, you‚Äôll be happy that it happened at an ‚Äúolder‚Äù age. When it happens you‚Äôll be stronger mentally, more prepared, and you‚Äôll be able to fully enjoy the experience.

A big tip, don't make your virginity a ""thing"". Don't let it be a personality trait. I wouldn't even mention being a virgin until asked and even then you still don't have to tell. People are judgemental so if you don't allow them to see your virginity as a bad thing, they won't see it as bad.

Also while the sex was great, I see now that sex is definitely overhyped by the media, porn, and jaded non-virgins/ho's lol."
virgin,flyk0bd,t1_fj6h89p,1585603590.0,I keep trying to tell myself that I shouldnt force it but I feel like it will never happen if I dont force it :(
VirginityExchange,fk6o76b,t3_ffi2jq,1583908917.0,"I‚Äôm not sure how to dm someone directly from here but my dms are open if you‚Äôre interested. I‚Äôm a female, 25, also in SoCal. It seems like we‚Äôre looking for the same thing, if you haven‚Äôt already found it by now. Lol"
VirginityExchange,fk6nytr,t3_fg3ell,1583908658.0,What‚Äôs your Snapchat?

virgin,ffgp4gr,t3_esq4p7,1579911504.0,"I‚Äôm a 25 year old, female, virgin and I now regret not taking the chances to have s x when I had them. But that‚Äôs just me. In the same, I have friends who are your age who just lost their virginities because the opportunity was there but they have all sense been embarrassed by those men and regret it. Even wish there were virgins again. Honestly, just do whatever you can mentally handle. If you‚Äôre questioning it now, it‚Äôs probably best that you wait."
sex,ffgotfr,t1_ff49nfk,1579911288.0,"It‚Äôs crazy to me that people forget they they were once virgins themselves. There are also many people who‚Äôve spelt with virgins and we shocked at how great their performance was. 

Anyway, let‚Äôs dm?"
virgin,fejb8gb,t1_feci9w8,1579165249.0,I hope so.
virgin,fejb6h6,t1_fdzow3m,1579165169.0,Same here! I refuse to go on like this. I‚Äôm ready to get this monkey off of my back
virgin,feaxk1v,t1_fe10jj3,1578953242.0,I‚Äôm in California. There‚Äôs a lot of opportunity for it here and it still isn‚Äôt happening for me which adds on to my bad feelings around this
virgin,fdz4eiz,t1_fcumorh,1578786593.0,I really really hope each of us get to enjoy some more than incredible sex lives in the future. We deserve it.
virgin,fdz3bcl,t3_enebjc,1578786260.0,This is so relatable. I‚Äôm sorry to see other feeling as bad as me.
virgin,fdyz9jr,t1_fdwndod,1578785084.0,Sounds cool to find someone who loves you that you can have sex with regularly and love it. At this point I can‚Äôt even imagine someone wanting to hold my hand let alone even kiss me or have sex. I‚Äôm 25 now and not seeing much hope for me. I guess a one night stand would be good enough if anyone was even willing to do that with me. Sucks too because people tell me I‚Äôm a good catch but whatever lol
sex,fd4wrsv,t3_ejrxa5,1578171796.0,"I am so utterly jealous. Congrats. I hope I get to share my virginity with someone someday, hopefully before I die lol. üòÇ"

AskReddit,fcu11ix,t1_f6h4gsa,1577968889.0,Hey! Yea we should chat! None of my other friends really have time for me these days lol. Theyre too occupied with their partners.
depression,fcu0g0q,t3_eiusio,1577968212.0,Yes and it hurts. Ive been taking vitamin B12.  It seems to help for a little while but I feel that I crash into even deeper depression once it wears off. I wish there was an escape.
virgin,fctyuuh,t1_fct788p,1577966304.0,"Same here. It's a terrible feeling. And Im a girl. People say its easier for us to get laid and perhapes thats true, but it has definetly not been true for me which makes me feel even more isolated and less of a woman."
virgin,fctys60,t3_eirudg,1577966210.0,"Yes my last virgin friend lost hers a few months ago. I feel terrible. I'm the oldest of my friends and Im the least experienced, not that there was a competition. I just thought I would have experienced what its like to be wanted by now. Maybe even get kissed. To make things worse its so obvious that my friends think theyre more mature than I am. But hey, maybe theyre right. I'm in my 20s btw."
virgin,fby75lb,t1_fbg6z67,1577209728.0,Oh no doubt it‚Äôs way easier for girls. It‚Äôs just not for me lol.
virgin,fbewhbl,t1_fbehsns,1576795595.0,Yes for me I‚Äôve been ready but the opportunity hasn‚Äôt come. Even when I‚Äôve planned to meet a dude it just hasn‚Äôt happened. It‚Äôs getting annoying. It‚Äôs like the universe is against me.....or on my side maybe....I don‚Äôt know :(
virgin,fbeginn,t3_ebo3ie,1576785190.0,Where‚Äôd you find the sex workers? I‚Äôm looking for a male one.
virgin,fbegd3n,t3_ecxhdu,1576785103.0,I don‚Äôt have any advice but I feel the same. You‚Äôre not alone. And I‚Äôm a female. They claim it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasier‚Äù for us but that hasn‚Äôt been my experience at all.

AskReddit,f4prkpx,t3_d16uog,1571741231.0,I feel terrible
virgin,f2vryrw,t3_defme0,1570456646.0,"Best birthday wishes to you. I dont think I can make you feel any better as I feel terrible myself. I'm still a virgin also and recently, I'm officially the last virgin I know. Anyways, I often swipe right on Asian males. We have nice conversation but nothing ever comes of it really (but for me thats with every guy of every race). I'm sorry you feel unaccepted because of that. I feel unaccepted because of my race too. Dont give up though. I know you will find love someday. Idk why the universe has some of us waiting so long though. It's not fair honestly."
depression,f2vq55u,t3_cs2ogj,1570455978.0,The only reason why I don't kill myself is because I dont want to embarrass my mother (she had many miscarriages before finally having me) and the fear of going to hell. Otherwise I'd be outta here.
sex,eymo9p0,t1_eykffcf,1567214924.0,"Wow so it was really just your time. It kinda makes me feel better to think that when it happens, it happens in an instant and its done. I wont have to even think about it much after that. I dont want to act as though sex is a game but I do feel it would be a bit of a hurdle to get over. It'll be nice to know that someone finds me remotely attractive in that way."
sex,eymntwv,t1_eykr4b3,1567214554.0,Ok so I have 5 good friends that Ive asked and only one said she wouldn't deal with a virgin man. One girl I used to go to school with (not my friend) who would even consider herself promiscuous took a guys virginity for sport. She ended up doing what we hear most guys do and ditched him. I mean thas only 4 out of 6 women of millions but thats an ok ratio I think. And then of course I'd be open to doing it also.
sex,eymmzk3,t1_eylqbb1,1567213820.0,Yea these dating apps have been pretty wack for me. I dont have any male friends but someone here suggested joining a motorcycle club. I know they didnt mean literally but I'm going to try hanging out in places with more guys for the exposure and friendship.
sex,eymmqb2,t1_eym0gl2,1567213602.0,Wow. I appreciate that! Well I hope you're right. Thank you!
sex,eykk9oa,t1_eykc4qd,1567156263.0,Lol yea ask her then please lemme know what she saysüòÇ
sex,eykatih,t1_eyk94rs,1567143000.0,HA. I was born in Norcal. Hit me up! lol
sex,eyk8vao,t1_eyk81p1,1567140851.0,Lmfaoo well its alright.
sex,eyk8slk,t1_eyevgde,1567140774.0,I guess all the guys I've talked to never felt that way.
sex,eyk8r20,t1_eyf6yhn,1567140730.0,I'm stuck between finding someone on that forum and just giving up completly. I feel repellent and its really taking blows to my confidence. I don't want to lose myself being caught up in finding someone. I also want to get it done so I can move on and stop wondering. lol Thanks for sharing your experience and wishing me luck.
sex,eyk8n8q,t1_eyettff,1567140619.0,Ofcourse I sympathise with all virgins because I am one but I would sleep with a male virgin now as long as I found him attractive and was comfortable enough. Ive never really asked my girls friends if they would but I believe they would.
sex,eyk8ebk,t1_eyf2oba,1567140365.0,Naw its ok. Honestly Ive had a good bit of confirmation when it comes to my looks. I know I'm not everyones cup of tea and sometimes not my oenwn but I dont think looks are my problem.
sex,eyk8a1q,t1_eyfitoz,1567140240.0,"Yea. The word ""virgin"" seems to scare a lot of people off, both men and women."
sex,eyk83ss,t1_eyfdfhi,1567140062.0,Thanks for sharing your experience with me. You totally get it. Its really hard and being around people who sort of invalidate it make add to the issue in a very negative way. People also dont get that it is a bit deeper than just sex but just knowing whether or not youre a desirable human. I would even call that egotictical as humans were designed to love and be attracted to eachother. I actually feel inhuman sometimes lol. Thank you again for sharing.
sex,eyk7vcx,t1_eyeysht,1567139823.0,Thank you for understanding. I am going to try going to new places and meeting new people. It is a hurtful situation but I know Ill get through it eventually. And I'm from SoCal.
sex,eyk7p2l,t1_eyewj4w,1567139650.0,Thats a good idea. I do like in a small town in Cali. I def need to venture out.
sex,eyk7npi,t1_eyetczd,1567139612.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience. How did you meet him? And when it came time to have sex, when did you tell him that you were a virgin?   
I really hope I can find a guy who's nice about it. I would prefer to have it be a boyfriend if I can ever get a guy tobe interested in me long enough lol."
sex,eyk7hty,t1_eyetqwj,1567139447.0,I understand what you're saying haha. Yea I may try again or just let fate have its way. I just hope I can be happy about all of this someday no matter the outcome.
sex,eyk7dt0,t1_eyh6ve9,1567139338.0,I hope so. Thanks again!
sex,eyk7aha,t1_eyf165n,1567139246.0,I hope it was a good experience for you!
sex,eyk78m2,t1_eyetda1,1567139194.0,I'm so happy for you! I think it will definetly be worth the wait. I also have a friend whose been in a long distance relathinship for 3 years and they will probably be getting married so theres no doubt in my mind that long distance relationships work. Congratulations to you finding mutual attraction!
sex,eyk50tg,t1_eyfottw,1567137117.0,"I'm not a very bold person. I think I will try putting myself out there more. Even if it doesnt lead to anyting, atleast Ill get the exposure and have more chances. Thank you."
sex,eyk4v9c,t1_eyftgtz,1567136979.0,In Southern California
sex,eyk40el,t1_eyg100q,1567136219.0,"Youre right. I will save it. Nothing wrong with being a late bloomer. I just have to keep remind myself of that. Also ""sweaty armpits""? LOL"
sex,eyk3wd3,t1_eyg4iu3,1567136119.0,I get it. Ive had men ask me tons of rude questions when it came to matters of virginity. It is a turn off to many men. I see that now.
sex,eyk3snb,t1_eyg4orr,1567136026.0,"Yea I think thats an issue for me too. The inner force is probably pushing people away without me even trying. Also, I would sleep with a virgin man if I were attracted to him. But ofcourse I sympathize."
sex,eyk3emc,t1_eyg96qb,1567135690.0,Isolating it the perfect word for it. I like myself but I cant help but wonder why I can never get it right when everyone else can. Thanks for understanding.
sex,eyk3brp,t1_eygan96,1567135622.0,"Yea. Id love to know what it is about other women that keep men engaged but other than that, I give up worrying about it anymore. I know I only posted this yesterday but I've been feeling this way for a while so Im starting to just be over it. Thanks for you comment."
sex,eyk32ha,t1_eygfjvz,1567135405.0,"When she approached you, what did she say? How was her conversation and how did she hold your attention? What was it about her that led you to sleeping with her? I woiuld love to know.
I'm kind of afraid to approach guys just based on some other outcomes Ive had but when the time comes I will try again. Thank you for wishing me luck."
sex,eyk2roc,t1_eyh5ui2,1567135149.0,"I have considered it. But after reasing other comments and experiences here, Id rather just leave everything up to fate. Actually trying hasnt gotten me anywhere lol. And thats ok."
sex,eyk2oo7,t1_eyh8feh,1567135079.0,I agree with everything you've said. Im not going to even focus on it anymore. Ofcourse I have needs and I do wish to feel wanted atleast once. I'll just wait for that day. I'm not going to force it.
sex,eyk2i3a,t1_eyh8qed,1567134926.0,Yea I have a feeling that Ill probably end up dating someone for a while before anyting happens. The universe has plans that are mush different from mine. Thats ok.
sex,eyk2csx,t1_eyh9t1u,1567134807.0,Thanks for that. Yea I think I'm just going to focus on myself and focusing on the other things life has to offer me. I cant control how people feel about me and I have to deal with that. Ill just continue to build myself up.
sex,eyk23g2,t1_eyhbuhz,1567134590.0,Thanks for your feedback. Yea Im def not going to make my virginity my identity. I actually dont think Im going to bother trying anymore. Im just going to focus on more positive things that I actually have control over. The rest may come later.
sex,eyk1yqw,t1_eyhnsth,1567134485.0,"Thanks for your feedback. I cans see bits of this being true. I'm not really a ""catch phrase"" person if im honest. And as far as ""crying"" honestly Ive been going through alot lately (aside from the dating thing) and just hearing about everyones great news in life while having none of my own has been a bit hard on me. Not because I'm not happy for them but because I'm tired of never really having the opportunity to be happy for myself. Feeling like people will never accept me for me romantically does hurt and sort of adds insult to injury for me especially because I dont know how to fix it. But as far as first impressions I see where you're coming from. I dont feel I'm being anyone other than myself so I'm not sure if I can change alot of it but I will be more aware of it. I think I'm just going to focus on my degree and work. If the rest comes fine, if not fine. Thanks for wishing me luck."
depression,eyglm81,t1_exc3rgx,1567072134.0,"All I can really say is that I know how you feel. I‚Äôm also tired of being here. It‚Äôs dreadful. But I just can‚Äôt imagine leaving my mom here feeling sad, alone and embarrassed. I‚Äôm just going to have to suffer until I die naturally. Hope this doesn‚Äôt take away from any of what you‚Äôve said. Just know that you‚Äôre not alone in feeling this way"
sex,eyeu6s5,t1_eyepihq,1567039066.0,Some men have asked and some planned on meeting to hook up. I thought it‚Äôd be fair to the both of us to mention it but I see I shouldn‚Äôt. They either ditch me or assume the worst of me since I‚Äôm still a virgin at this age. I‚Äôm for sure never telling anyone again about it lol
sex,eyetojh,t1_eyeniuy,1567038854.0,Do you feel less nervous dating knowing that someone was even willing to lean in and kiss you? I feel I‚Äôve reached a new low. I don‚Äôt even think I could get a guy to hold my hand at this point.
sex,eyetjsk,t1_eyel1bh,1567038799.0,Thanks for the suggestion. Yea I‚Äôve decided 100% I‚Äôm never mentioning it to any future guys I talk with
sex,eyetd3a,t1_eyekwny,1567038724.0,"I hope I find success eventually. I think for me, I‚Äôm just not going to tell any of them anymore. Cause I‚Äôll never lose it if people are always going to be afraid to take it lol."

sex,eyet655,t1_eyedz3q,1567038644.0,Lol yea go ahead lol. And same! Another reason why I was considering getting an escort since I don‚Äôt have any male friends lol
sex,eyet1lh,t1_eyeb70a,1567038592.0,Thank is for that. I hope it‚Äôs true. Other men haven‚Äôt seemed to see it that way. Sucks.
sex,eyesxxo,t1_eye94r6,1567038551.0,Yea I‚Äôm going to just wait it out
sex,eyeswd7,t1_eye6hm5,1567038533.0,"Right! It sucks. And it‚Äôs not just the physical part of things but just feeling unwanted and not knowing what to do to fix it. 

I really hope you find someone who cares about you!"
sex,eyesrbm,t1_eye2cwf,1567038474.0,I understand. Yea I‚Äôve wanted my first to be with someone I actually likes and likes me but I‚Äôve sort of done away with it as it been super hard for me. But yea I‚Äôm sure there are men who aren‚Äôt afraid of commitment. I just haven‚Äôt met any yet. Sad because I‚Äôm not even looking for sometime this anymore but they never get a chance to find that out.
sex,eyesggw,t1_eye25vp,1567038349.0,"Yea you‚Äôre right. I think for me it‚Äôs just the constant being alone, and unwanted. And constantly being ditched that hurts the most. I def want the sex but I feel it‚Äôs such a simple thing I‚Äôm asking for and can‚Äôt even get."
sex,eyes9pw,t1_eydz6c1,1567038273.0,"We‚Äôre all in this together fam. If worse comes to worse, their are escort services"
sex,eyes74z,t1_eyerd8i,1567038244.0,Yea I think if I ever get there I‚Äôll tell a guy right when he‚Äôs about to go in lol. Or maybe just take control of the pace and y‚Äôall him afterwards lol. I‚Äôm not to afraid if the pain. I just wish someone would stick around long enough to get to sex lol

sex,eydwtpq,t1_eydrd3h,1567025775.0,"Yea I think many of the men who have ditched me were in it for themselves which I guess is a good thing for me in the end. But man, Im wiling to learn. And Ive masturbated so much I have an idea of what I want and can do LOL \*sips tea\*"
sex,eydwc97,t1_eydr1j6,1567025590.0,I appreciate you for that lol. Yea man. My virginity had mad dudes guy repellent. Im not going to mention it next time lol.
sex,eydw2db,t1_eydrim4,1567025484.0,"Whew I had to screenshot this one. I think you've hit the nail on the head in regard to how I'm feeling. Ive even found myself getting angry inside each time my friends tell me about ""the great sex my bf and I had last night"". One of my friends who's a couple years younger than me got her first kiss recently and I glad she told me via text because I actually cried lol. 

Thank you for letting me know I'm not alone. I feel intensely lonley at times because of this. I forget that Im not the only person in the world in this sitaution."
sex,eydvcqm,t1_eyds42x,1567025212.0,"Thats great! Im happy that you 2 found eachother. I hope that for myself. That has also been part of my issue. I feel like I need to be attracted to the person I do it with and I havent found that yet. And when I am attracted to the guy, he's not to me. *sigh* lol"
sex,eydv1oq,t1_eydt6i1,1567025097.0,Thanks for rooting for me fam :)
sex,eyduqo5,t1_eydu2vo,1567024982.0,Wow I am so happy you found someone to do it with who actually loves you and wants you! I know that makes sex 50x better. Honestly that was my first ideal scenario. I guess its just been hard for me to find to Ive kindof done away with it. But I mean its not too late!
sex,eydtiih,t1_eydnn7k,1567024519.0,Thank you for that. Yea Im going to keep trying. Im late but Im sure itll be worth it in the end.
sex,eydtepl,t1_eydnqxq,1567024477.0,Thank you for being kind. Yea I guess I get upset as I see everyone around me peeling off and being wanted. But I'm sure theres time. I just get frustrated at times.
sex,eydstdh,t1_eydnuiy,1567024236.0,Yea I can totally see that. I might be coming off as desperate and I def dont want to seem that way (even though I kinda am cause I be gettin' horny lol) but I think youre right. Im going to try to not make too big of a deal about it next time. Thanks for the encouragment.
