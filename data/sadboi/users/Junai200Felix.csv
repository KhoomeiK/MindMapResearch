FtMpassing,fm6qgjo,t3_fteic8,1585800412.0,You're definitely passing. I would say 19 to 23
selfharm,fm67p0d,t1_fm67gpr,1585788050.0,It's depression and dysphoria mostly. Thanks for even just talking to me tho

FtMpassing,fkw32lr,t3_fl02t1,1584582348.0,I would say a bit shorter on the top. It makes the rest of your face look rounder to me
