acupuncture,fc3z66t,t3_eg0udw,1577402415.0,"I second that. The Japanese approach is often much more gentle. Toyohari being the best version of Japanese acupuncture for trauma (although it can be difficult to find a practitioner). Toyohari is all about non stimulation. However, most practitioners are trained in the Chinese approach (TCM) which favours deeper needling and a stimulation of the nervous system (called de qi in TCM). This can actually have pretty terrible consequences for someone who is already struggling with significant nervous system issues. Also, healing from things like anxiety, depression and adrenal fatigue requires compassion on the side of the practitioner as they gently try to support full system healing. Make sure that your practitioner is experienced and genuinely interested in supporting that work and all that comes with it. Not all acupuncturists are particularly interested in the mental health side of it even though acupuncture and asian medicine in general have a lot to offer in terms of supporting the healing these things."
CPTSD,fbswkpt,t3_eeap1h,1577062130.0,"I can relate. I've had several good phases. And lots of bad ones where I find myself regressing, usually with heavy alcohol and drugs (not recommended btw). But in the past couple of years I've started to learn more and realize that its the trauma, an unregulated brain and NS, (and broken heart from years of twisted psychological abuse as a young child). Its a miracle I'm still alive. I realize that its a success just to stay alive, and try as best I can to heal. I've had a hard year myself where I lost a fairly comfortable existence due to my mental health deteriorating. Its sucks when that happens. The intersection between poverty, homelessness, addiction and trauma has been frighteningly real for me this year. But I'm hoping for a better year ahead."
stopsmoking,fbbjx4l,t3_eccrwm,1576702002.0,"Thank you for this. I am getting ready to stop again and this is weirdly encouraging. The last time was rough and I made it close to 5 days. I have to remember that its okay, that I'm okay, even if its a bit messy. Good luck on your journey."
stopsmoking,fawm7j3,t1_favas49,1576373008.0,That is the kindest response. Thank you.
BPD,fawl2xi,t3_eamaca,1576372734.0,I can relate. Maybe not the laying bed exactly but the despair. And how mental illness is heartbreaking. You're not alone.
stopsmoking,faoqioj,t3_e9zkgf,1576270281.0,"Its not willpower. You're not broken. Honestly I've been feeling the same way these past few months. Buying a new pack of cigarettes everyday. Smoking a few and then throwing the rest out fully determined it was my last and that for sure I will not pick up again. Only to buy more the next day like nothing ever happened. It got expensive doing that. And started to feel very insane and very hopeless. Wanting to stop but not being able to. Anyway, you can do this. Do not give up. I'm only 4.5 days so its not like I have the answers. But You can do this."
stopsmoking,faoq0xz,t3_ea77xs,1576269960.0,Me too! 4 days and 15 hours.
stopsmoking,falhx27,t1_faktpai,1576184647.0,"I'm drinking enough coffee to raise the dead. Probably not a great long term plan but short term seems okay. And lots of treats, like cake and pastries. Anything but a cigarette. I had alot of loneliness/despair type thinking creeping in late last night. Honestly that is the worst. I just tried to be kind to myself and to say nice things, like 'your doing really good' and 'its just going to take some time'. Good luck on your journey. We can do this!!"
stopsmoking,falhcyd,t1_fakhzur,1576184383.0,Thanks for the encouraging words!
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,f9vvcn7,t3_e75off,1575680756.0,"Thanks for this. I can relate to what you're saying big time. I have a degree and have worked in similar fields. Its a total mind fuck on many levels even when you're stable and doing good. Still, don't give up that you cannot do something in this field if not now then in the future. Try to have a long term plan, as it sounds like you invested alot in your education to get to where you are at now. I went through some pretty hard times realizing 'this is it?!' 'this is what I trained so hard for?!?' Its okay to take a break away from that kind of work to get some perspective and to keep focusing on your own healing.  If you have any unresolved trauma or mental health concerns find ways to start addressing this. Its dangerous otherwise.

Maybe you will decide to do something different. I've done lots of other things when it feels like I can't do that kind of work. Think about what motivated you to want to help others. I know the fire can die pretty quickly once we get out there and start seeing whats really up. Give yourself credit for getting up each day and having the courage to be clean, and to better yourself personally and professionally."
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,f9atv37,t1_f98xfsf,1575206343.0,">From my own experience of NA meetings we are all very careful to make sure we speak of how great recovery has been and not focus too much on our struggles, as we donâ€™t want to be the person not succeeding in recovery.

Very well said. I think there is name for that - inauthenticity.  There are very few meetings that I feel resonate at the level of authentic sharing, or honest sharing. Lots of ego, weird power dynamics, steps tripping, and so forth. But when a meeting gets vulnerable, hearts can heal."
BPD,f97in2e,t3_e47hc8,1575166097.0,This is funny. Thank you
REDDITORSINRECOVERY,f978tn2,t3_e45y3e,1575161997.0,"Thank you so much for posting this. For your courage.

I've been thinking alot about very similar things lately. I appreciate your ability to write it out so honestly and clearly. I am currently over two years sober and have been in recovery for many years. However, its been a rough year or so in regards to my relationship with the 12 steps process because every time I go to a meeting, and listen to the message of recovery, I don't believe in it anymore. Its not the people - innocent and damaged just like me trying to repair their lives - but the processes we are supposedly engaging in to heal. The 12 steps. In fact I have felt the whole process to be dangerous, unsafe, and insensitive, particularly to the nuances of healing trauma, or addressing the many aspects of depression and other mental health issues that so are often comorbid with addiction. I've left so many meetings feeling literally sick to my stomach because of the rhetoric I hear and the untreated trauma I see in the rooms. I think the concept of **spiritual bypass** or **spiritual bypassing** captures this concern, which is defined as a ""tendency to use **spiritual** ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks"". The term was introduced in the early 1980s by John Welwood, a Buddhist teacher and psychotherapist (this is quoted from wikipedia). I am familiar with the idea because I am also a recovering Buddhist (recovering from buddhism) who in my early teens and twenties sought buddhist practice very seriously in order to deal with alot of pain in my life with fairly catastrophic consequences that took years to disentangle. 

I think when we come into recovery (12 step fellowships) we are very very vulnerable, and therefore also susceptible to manipulation and coercion. We are told a lot of things. Its understandable that we latch on to the 12 steps and the ideas contained within because we very sincerely want to find stability and healing. I don't think that is a bad thing, and I have certainly found people who have done a tremendous amount of healing through working the steps. But just because it is what we are told, and what the big books says, and all that, does not necessarily make it correct. I have wondered very sincerely this year, that perhaps it is just the simple gathering of humans that helps us most. And that true recovery is found in developing a multifaceted approach to supporting the process of change we earnestly seek and need, to heal. And in some cases (most I would say) it also means taking the 12 steps with a grain of salt. And being very careful about how we approach our healing if we are to us them at all. It literally pains me when I hear experienced long time members trash therapy (there are many people that do this), or look down upon it as a secondary aspect of true recovery.  

Personally there will be no more 4ths for me. There was a lot of fancy footwork that happened but I now realize that this was another mechanism to suppress, distort, and bypass the very deep aspects of complex pain that I am only now having the courage to finally heal. And not through the program.

Stay strong my friend."
