It took me years to believe that again.  It got so inside my head, even this morning I remembered an old friend walking up to me after his wedding and telling me to leave after I'd travelled for hours to see him get married and I was so sad: he hadn't told me not to come, I wasn't reproved or dfd I just hadn't been out on the preach as much lately and he'd already decided I was darkening his life.  I was sad for the broken kid that I was then, and the bullshit that I let people put me through.  I don't do that anymore.

I recently woke from a dream in which my family had travelled the country to be in the same town as my wedding and spend time together there, in the same building as me, but not with me or attend my wedding.  In that dream I took my power back: I didn't humbly accept my penance, I approached and asked them 'so, why didn't you attend my wedding, was it some kind of flight snafu or something?' and when they stammered and said 'no sass, you know why we didn't attend your wedding' I told them to GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE which for some reason was suddenly where my wedding was but hey it was a dream. And they got the fuck out of it.

Anyway, I guess my point is that after years of trauma it is going to take a few years for your subconscious to catch up with you.  I used to be reminded every few minutes.
