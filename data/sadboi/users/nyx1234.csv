AskReddit,fqjtooj,t1_fqiw0jj,1589415046.0,"Oops, I guess I meant your second point, the one about how acronyms are pronounced. That was my bad, a simple mistake, and I promise I had no bunched panties while commenting haha. I just was pointing out a consistency issue (as in the A in NASA is pronounced “ah” instead of the “ay” for aeronautics).

My “I’m not an asshole” comment was just trying to convey that I don’t care that much what others say, not enough to correct them anyway... not trying to imply that you’re the asshole... and definitely not trying to upset you enough to get a rude, paragraphs long reply. 

Sorry to have offended you! I think there was a written-communication failure."

gif pronounced as jif is a hill I die on when it comes to what’s technically correct. But I don’t go around correcting others because I’m not an asshole."

Still delicious to me though :)"

BPD,fqgivhi,t1_fqfwymf,1589347445.0,"I totally relate. The shame around my past behavior towards someone I loved is so intense, sometimes I would have almost flashbacks to the terrible things I did and their reactions. I honestly felt completely disassociated and “out of body” at those times, like watching a demon take me over, and now I have to live with the memories. I’ve messaged once or twice apologizing over the years, but they don’t respond and I don’t blame them, I wouldn’t want to talk to my abuser either.

Luckily with therapy (DBT) and time I’ve recovered enough to be in a happy 3 year long relationship (~6 months married!). We still have our toxic moments (he has mental health issues as well) but compared to my past behavior things are vastly, vastly improved."
BPD,fqfxrhm,t1_fqfu9zi,1589333805.0,"Good for you that you haven’t lost control of your emotions in a way that hurts others on a regular basis but... read the other comments. Look around. Consider what ex-partners of those with BPD say. Clearly this is resonating with a lot of diagnosed people and their past and current partners. Whether we like it or not, the symptoms of BPD can easily lead to abusive behavior when not treated, and someone putting their head in the sand about their behavior because acknowledging it adds to the “stigma” isn’t going to help fight the issue at hand. 

I’d also argue some DSM V symptoms are hard to have without being an abuser. Frantic attempts to avoid real or imagined abandonment- “frantic” can often lead to manipulative behavior. Alternating extremes of devaluation and idealization in relationships- playing hot and cold with someone’s feelings is asshole-ish at best and can easily become abusive. Inappropriate, intense anger/hard to control anger- that’s pretty self explanatory, that yelling and screaming and throwing things can easily become abusive. 

So yeah. It’s not inherent. But don’t act like it’s not a very real part of dealing with this and something that many, many BPD people have to address."
CICO,fq4a0mv,t1_fq3ppqo,1589075174.0,I would probably weigh how much of it gets sprayed and then use the typical calories of olive oil to estimate! I think it’s still useful when you’re trying to use oil sparingly because it maximizes the surface area you can cover with a thin layer but you do have to be careful!
