prozac,fiofkjz,t1_fiocc3p,1582582294.0,"I started off on 20 mg in the beginning of January. By my next appointment, in the beginning of February, the Prozac stopped working all together, including side effects. So she bumped me up to 40 mg. This was back on February 3rd, and my side effects are still with me. Lol so I don't know if they will last long term."
prozac,fioaxju,t3_f8w4g1,1582579700.0,"My sexual side effects are similar to yours. Since starting prozac, my sex drive has been through the roof! I cannot stay off of my husband. It takes me about 3 times longer to actually argasm though, it takes FOREVER. But the orgasms I have are the BEST orgasms that I have ever had. 

Super weird that we are getting opposite side effects lol"
prozac,fhcg17i,t3_f2bmkp,1581462353.0,"Not really ""insomnia"" per se for me ... But I have noticed since taking Prozac that I will wake up around 4:30 am and it is really hard for me to fall back asleep. Also, I get really sick if I take my Prozac, then eventually take a nap. It can be really annoying. Have you talked to hour doctor about no sleep? Maybe they can prescribe you something that may help. My doctor has me on lamictal for my mood stabilizer and for sleep."
Anxiety,ffrwqhu,t3_euub8p,1580167608.0,"I have struggled with this for years! Phone calls are horrible for me. I will not answer nor will I call back. In 2015 my therapist got me a job at a call center and told me that it will help a lot. Well, I did great at work but if my personal phone rang, my anxiety still would not let me answer. I am still struggling with this today. I answered my doctors calls twice in one day last week because I was having issues getting my medication to the pharmacy, but I was so proud of myself for answering those calls. Good for you for taking that small, but exciting step! Best of luck to you ❤"
Paranormal,feauxh0,t3_eo2q6j,1578952409.0,Dolls in my bedroom are a big NOPE for me. I don't care if they are possessed or not. Still creepy lol
Anxiety,fearys0,t3_eo8s1a,1578951708.0,"My appointment actually went very well! I loved everyone there. I was very anxious until after I checked in, then I calmed down some. She put me on ProZac, Lomictal (sp?), and Ativan. I have been on ProZac and Ativan before, but never Lomictal. I am just so happy I actually conquered my fears and went to this appointment instead of just canceling it and letting my anxiety win. I go back in 3 weeks for a follow up appointment."
Anxietyhelp,fdwjr76,t3_emytgk,1578759478.0,"Yes! Before I go into an anxiety attack, my entire body will feel like it dropped. Then my stomach will drop and start spinning. Then the tingling feeling in my neck/head. Then my heart starts to race. Then I get extremely hot and start to shake. It's horrible."
Anxiety,fdw2h0h,t3_en6f0d,1578754341.0,"I am going through the exact same thing right now. I have not ate a full meal for a week now. I was able to eat a piece of toast the other day. I have some issues going on in my marriage that caused my anxiety to flare out though. This has happened to me before and I was hospitalized with Anorexia caused by anxiety. But I don't have a body image issue, it's just the fact that my stomach is constantly hurting from my anxiety and there is nothing I can do about it. I thankfully made myself my first doctors appointment since 2015 and will be visiting a new doctor on Monday. My anxiety doesn't like anything new so I'm getting worked up about going to see the doctor. Things go through my head like, what if there is an issue with my insurance? What do I say? How will I walk in? What if I get lost? So on and so forth. This anxiety literally controls my life, all the way down to my eating habits. I'm so sick of it."

Anxiety,fdri6nj,t3_emvpsb,1578684863.0,"I get very irritable with my anxiety. It doesn't matter if I had the best day ever, as soon as my anxiety hits, I get mean and cold due to being irritable. I don't want anyone around me, touching me, or making noise."
Anxiety,fdp7kep,t1_fdowyn1,1578621848.0,"The smoothies are actually a good idea! Thank you, I will try this!"
Anxiety,fdp7hgu,t1_fdouhm4,1578621794.0,"Thank you so much for this. I was able to eat a piece of toast. Your comment also made me cry because sometimes I forget that some things are not my fault. Again, thank you so much for your comment ❤"
Anxiety,fdl6r25,t3_elvyuy,1578517997.0,"I need the biggest hug ever right now. I'm going through a very difficult challenge in my marriage, and my anxiety is tearing me up. I haven't ate in two days because of the stomach pain associated with my anxiety. I don't want to have to put myself in the hospital. I could use all the hugs and positive vibes available. I wish anxiety didn't exist!"
