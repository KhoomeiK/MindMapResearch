Sometimes major holidays can make us really think about the things we may missing in life.

But people develop on their own in different ways. Try not to cutout people in your life (I understand it may be difficult). As much as we might not think about it, some of them may know what you are going through and may be able to help. 

If not, there are strangers here willing to put the effort in :)"
