But good news: they aren't the only people in the world. You can go for a hike yourself. Go out wandering and do what you love, and you'll find like-minded people along the way. Don't limit your friendships to people you know just because you've known them for a long time. An excellent friendship may be just around the corner!"

I used to swear quite a bit, but I trained myself to stop. And I agree, slurs and curse words are very vague and don't - contrary to the opinion of those who use them - actually help to express anything. They aren't constructive at all to proper communication between people. When you use them, your real feelings are not heard, and in fact, the person on the receiving end tends to feel more attacked, and therefore less likely to listen to your real concern as well. Pretty pointless when you break it down!"

mentalhealth,flalisx,t3_fnk22w,1584986242.0,"Your feelings are genuine and real and yours. No matter what other people say. If you say you are lonely, you are. As a female, I understand how someone who feels lonely would try to fill that void through intimacy. But sadly,  as you probably well know, that's just a quick fix that doesn't actually remove the loneliness. 

i think one of the hardest things to learn is that on some level, we are all lonely. No matter how many people we surround ourselves with, we can only connect with others for a short time. Even people who are married, or who have children, can engage in instances of connection. The only way to overcome this is to learn to connect with yourself and God (if you believe in God)."

mentalhealth,fhsp704,t3_f4jbh9,1581863644.0,"That's because we've put a negative spin on the word ""attention"". But when you think about it, ""seeking attention"" is just another way of saying ""getting help"" or even just simply connecting with someone, when you feel isolated and alone.

So yeah, maybe the wording is a little off. But if the world does pay a little more attention to the souls that are finding it hard to stay around, things could improve a lot more. Obviously, though, if that attention was given *before* anyone attempts suicide would probably be even better!"
mentalhealth,fh2b0pj,t3_f16rk3,1581243957.0,"Hi, 

There's nothing wrong with you. Just sounds like you're having a bit of a rough time. 

Mistakes are ok. There's no need to beat yourself up over them. Everyone, even people who seem super ""successful"" make mistakes all the time! If we didn't make mistakes, how would we ever learn? 

You're clearly able to articulate your emotions, so that's definitely a plus point for you in terms of social skills. Maybe you just haven't found your tribe yet? That's okay, too. Sometimes these things just take time. 

I don't know about your friends finding you annoying, because I don't know you. But you know what? I have people in my life that I love dearly, even though they have characteristics that are annoying, sometimes. They might talk too much during a movie, or chew loudly, or never be able to accept that they're in the wrong. It might bother me, but it doesn't stop me from loving them or wanting them to thrive and do amazing things. It certainly doesn't mean that I would be happy for them to be dead. In fact, I would go to great lengths to prevent that from happening, if I could! 

The thing is, we only get to know people's ""annoying"" quirks when they're close to us. When we've let them in and opened our hearts to them. So if anyone close to you finds you annoying, that means that they've already let you in quite close. And they've kept you there. You're valuable to them.

So even if (and I'm saying if because there is no guarantee) that someone does actually find you annoying, I very much doubt that they would want you to end your own life, much less be pleased for that to happen. They would be very sad. And they would be heartbroken. And they would spend their lives thinking what it is they could have done to help you feel more loved.

Have you tried to speak to someone about this?"
mentalhealth,fh2aj3z,t3_f1222f,1581243241.0,"I feel like everyone feels this on some level. Anyone who says otherwise is probably lying. No matter how much you work on yourself, there's always people out there who have done more work, so we feel 'inadequate' compared to them. The important thing is to just stop comparing yourself to other people and do the best you can in every given moment. Remember that we're all different, we have different strengths, and with and practice we can grow too! Believe in yourself!"

unpopularopinion,ff5rmn9,t3_cqujgj,1579607556.0,"I totally understand where you're coming from and it's a valid argument.

But sometimes, I just want to find examples of people that I, as a woman, can narrate to. Women and men are physiologically and biologically different and as a result, on a physical and emotional level, face different challenges. For my own personal progress, I want to see stories of women who have been challenged and who have overcome those challenges exceptionally well so that I can learn from them and grow in my own womanhood. 

However, because the nature of female life has, over the course of human history, been predominantly linked to the home and private life, it is natural that those stories are less visible. A lot of a woman's story is linked with that of other people in her life. There is a respect and a privacy involved, because the life is *private life*, not public life. So those struggles have been less apparent. 

Also, previously, women of one household or family used to live closer lives. Mothers and daughters and aunts and grandmas, in many cultures, would work together to prepare food for the family, to help in whatever aspect of life was deemed as ""women's work"". So young girls had readily available female role models who had experience in the tasks that they were expected to perform as they grew older. They didn't need stories of role models of person x or y, because they had a team of role models who surrounded them and inspired them everyday. 

Today, women are expected to be able to perform in a wider range of roles than before, but they are not trained to do those tasks well. The roles have been created over time for men, and women who are entering the workspace are both lacking in role models and the know how of how to, as a woman, navigate those spaces, without losing their identity. At the same time, the structure of domestic life has changed, and the role models she had previously are no longer readily available, either. A lot of people live without mothers, grandmothers, aunts or older siblings who can show them how to grow into womanhood.

If you look at the ""celebration"" of female women as a ""celebration"", then I understand your opinion. But I think if we look at this trend as merely a way for us to highlight the female narrative so as to help and empower other females to learn from our struggles, then we will be less opposed to this ""celebration"", because we see that it serves a purpose. It's not done just to make people feel good about themselves. It's done as a service. Or at least that's the intention."
