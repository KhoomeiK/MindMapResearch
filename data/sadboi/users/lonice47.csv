Being molested is an extremely traumatizing thing and depersonalization, in my experience, numbs your mind from feeling the emotions associated with the traumatic event. I hope that seeing a doctor and potentially discussing your trauma will help."

depression,f4m781k,t3_dkx9yc,1571675192.0,"I started going to the gym 5 times a week. I literally only started going for my mental health. Get a cheap gym membership or just start walking outside. It gives me a purpose. Sometimes I go in the morning and sometimes I go at night; you decide when to go based on when you feel you’re most energetic during the day. You deserve to have a healthy body and mind. It is so hard but so incredibly worth it. After going for a bit I started lifting and gaining muscle, which made me feel so much more empowered and energetic. It is something that most doctors tell you to do and I know how hard it is but it really is key. I don’t have nearly as much energy as I’d like to, and I still struggle with sleeping too much, but trying to start a routine is crucial. I’ve been going to the gym for almost a year now regularly and I can’t say it’s the answer to all problems, because I am still depressed and still have low motivation and energy, but it is a step in the right direction. Also, stop eating fast food. Your body deserves real food and nourishment and greasy food has always made me feel like shit and more depressed. Cutting down alcohol helps too. Also, TONS of water. It makes me feel lighter and more in control for some reason. Everything is a mental game. I pray you find the light to help you get through this hard time."
