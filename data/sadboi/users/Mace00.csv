offmychest,f6ys319,t3_dttzyo,1573294132.0,"There’s lots you can do it takes great strengths I believe in you. First of all please don’t shoot yourself i really struggle with death and change and it will make me really sad. I know I don’t know you but i believe in you buddy I’ll help you please don’t make me sad. Secondly, your goals are too far in the future you need to do the first steps. This could be getting dressed every day- it really helps. Or if you feel really brave you could try and go for a walk to the shop or walk around the block. I had to do that last year I didn’t leave for a few months it was the hardest thing ever! If that’s too much try and sit in your garden or wash your car or parents car at least it’s an outside activity right? If that is too much try opening your window get use to some fresh air it might help to build up to the big bits. If you can’t find a reason to do any of this run errands for your mum like posting some letters? Popping to the shop? Whatever she needs. I always found it easier if I had a purpose I would always go to the bank. Make sure you have headphones and lose yourself if you’re self conscious of what people are thinking like me. Play games in your head whilst you’re walking. I play “day what you see” so as you walk you’re like “a tree, a dog, a building, a bridge” really engages you in the now. Thirdly, if you want to meet new people once you are comfortable getting outa bit more you can sign yourself up to a fitness class or any class you have interest in and meet someone there. If not start looking for a job my first job I met my best friend. It just happens. I know you’re brave enough to do this I believe in you you have a purpose and a reason to stick around it takes a lot of strength to be that person and when you do you will feel invincible. I always have people say to me “OMG I don’t know how I could be you I would be drowning if I went through what you did you’re so strong” I personally feel like I’m not in behind in education I’m behind in my development but I get up everyday and go to woke and that’s what people care about. The strength to pick yourself up. You never know who you might meet along the way. If it helps get a doggie then you can walk it and other dog walkers will get chatting to you about your dog. Finally, with the porn. Don’t worry bro. I was an ex sex addict when I started working I’d watch it in my lunch breaks cause I just couldn’t drop it. Even when I had a boyfriend. It’s just like any addiction. You’re just bored and want something to do and you have a really high sex drive. Nothing to be ashamed of we’ve all done it. Don’t hurt yourself. It’s okay to watch porn no matter how many times a day. I always feel disgusting after I watch porn I’m usually okay and it passes. It is hard tho. Remember life is hard but tad not that bad.  It’s okay to not be okay. I’m not judging you. If you need to start slow win human contact again get an online BFF but don’t get too indulged in it a lot of people end up spending their life on their phone which they carry out meeting actual people. Just some support behind you is all you need. Pretty sure all of reddit will be rooting for you! You’re awesome keep it up! I know you can do this I believe in you!"

BPD,f5ka8t8,t3_do6ty3,1572258620.0,"That’s a shitty thing to happen but you need to remember BPD is a mental illness it’s not curable and if you have it you have to deal with it. You won’t ever get completely better but you can say to that swine who said that that you’re doing better than you were and you’re handling more than you did. Don’t let yourself get pushed down because someone thinks they’re a doctor. They don’t know your situation they may only see black and white. 
One thing I accepted from having BPD is I’m different and with that I express it, my fiancé and I want a fancy dress wedding because we want something different. I thought I was doing better and my fiancé turned round saying I was too impulsive again and I was like well fuck. 
BPD covers a lot of different things and not every single thing you can get a hold of or have under control all at the same time. You need to focus on the thing that’s bothering you most and keep a hold of that, maybe you’re anxiety is the most important therefore blocking any knowledge of your other symptoms that may stand out or act out atm. You said you’re anxiety was getting better that’s great! That’s all on you! I’m so proud of you for staying strong and fixing what bothers you most. 
Bottom line is we’re different and we’re coping as much as we can. Be proud of what you’ve dealt with today not any details you may have missed that you did in the week. Practice makes perfect. The best we can do is get by with what we’ve learnt and how well we know ourselves. You seem pretty with it and understanding and I look up to you. 
Remember it’s okay to not be okay - my fiancé’s favourite line ❤️ stay strong"

BPD,f16qxsh,t3_d82h7d,1569220821.0,I don’t think it’s the job in itself I think we as people with BPD need more time to our selves so we don’t get overwhelmed as every occasion is a highly emotional occasion for us and we would benefit from more time to ‘wind down’ than others would. For example others can do 5 full days of work and chill at the weekend. Me personally (I do work full time but I’d prefer) work 2 days in the middle of the week or maybe 3 days spread out in the week so I have that recalibration time with my thoughts and emotions.

BPD,ezwhzb8,t1_ezw3iac,1568217118.0,We both have the decency when someone is over emotional about something we will lay back and talk when we are both calm or understand that the other is overwhelmed and not retaliate. We are both equal in our relationship we both want it to work so we don’t even fight we just discuss. He also says a lot that he words things in certain ways because there is just some stuff he can’t say to me. He also picks it out in other people and say that they can’t say it to me like that because i just can’t handle it. I am very lucky he’s definitely a keeper. Just takes understanding and respect.
BPD,ezwhn4o,t1_ezw310p,1568216895.0,"You pick an emotion, assign a colour, easy. You need to figure out which emotions you feel the most so you don’t get over whelmed with colours to choose from. You don’t have to be creative you just need to think how can I get across my emotions easier. I started mine in my notes on my phone. Truth be told having my fiancée has helped he is very supportive and does direct me and check up on me. Although I decided to do my chart so I could recognise my emotions so in different situations I’ve got into the habit to take a second in my head and figure out wtf it is I’m feeling. The colours just make it easier for me to figure it out. You’re not doomed I’ll be your BPD partner, I got you, I’ll direct you 😊😂"

BPD,ezvlszy,t3_d2ddrc,1568183754.0,"I was doing a questionnaire for therapy and one of the questions was ‘in the last week I have intimidated some one’ so I asked my fiancé as we were going through it together and he said “does asking me what you want constantly so you intimidate me into giving you what you want’ (or something along them lines I can’t remember correctly what was said) 

Honestly I was absolutely beside myself I had no idea I was even capable of that! I didn’t know what it meant and didn’t know I could do it! The naivety of my actions and my emotions really can get me into trouble the worst part is I’m completely innocent to it but I hurt a lot of people. 

I said the other day, although it’s difficult to take in, I actually prefer when people tell me how my actions have affected them as I have no clue."

It’s unfair and darn right horrible I never ever got justice for both my encounters so I beg you tell an elder and explain your situation. I believe in you. They will deal with the abuser and I suggest talking to a doctor or getting therapy for yourself. It may turn out justice isn’t what it seems and it only heals 5% of it and you’re still struggling.

BPD,ezqp3x2,t3_d1w8n6,1568062195.0,"Never say sorry when you’ve done nothing wrong. I always apologise to my fiancé about literally anything I’ll accidentally nudge him and say sorry. I’ll say sorry for our table being delayed on date night. I’ll say sorry for stupid things that can’t be helped and irrelevant to us. 

When you say sorry you should say it because you are sorry for your actions not because you feel bad for how you might of made him feel when you’re trying to express your emotions. I’ve also learnt that people actually find it as a turn off when you over apologise because in their eyes it’s annoying. 

In our eyes it’s the end of the world! Whatever little thing that’s occurred and we’re apologising for it’s a big deal- remember it might not be to them. 

Don’t say sorry for something that can’t be helped and isn’t your fault."
