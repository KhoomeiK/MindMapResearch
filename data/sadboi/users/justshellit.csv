The US wasn't supposed to even have a standing army.

Somewhat true.  There were multiple purposes to the second amendment.  Lets actually listen on the people who wrote it and why they included it.  

""What country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance. Let them take arms.""
- Thomas Jefferson, letter to James Madison, December 20, 1787

""To disarm the people...[i]s the most effectual way to enslave them.""
- George Mason

""The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered, as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers; and will generally, even if these are successful in the first instance, enable the people to resist and triumph over them.""
- Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, 1833

""What, Sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty .... Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins.""
- Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, I Annals of Congress 750, August 17, 1789

""[I]f circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow-citizens. This appears to me the only substitute that can be devised for a standing army, and the best possible security against it, if it should exist.""
- Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 28, January 10, 1788

""As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms.""
- Tench Coxe, Philadelphia Federal Gazette, June 18, 1789

The second amendment isn't to protect the government as much as it is to prevent a standing army from trampling your rights.  While the context of the second amendment can be debated, the founders literal explanation of it cannot be. 

While your explanation is half correct, it also ignores the principle that it was designed as a counter to a standing army."

Even if they did use Incirlik, it doesn't mean anything.  Turkey doesn't green light operations out of Incirlik anyways.  

Either way, Turkey at the most played an almost non existent role. At the most maybe an asset or two on the ground reporting movements.  Either way, they were not informed of much of anything at all.  Even Congress wasn't informed."
syriancivilwar,f5gd4qk,t1_f5fca1w,1572192009.0,"> Some sources say that Turkey didn't even contribute intelligence though

The intelligence you mentioned wouldn't have been needed from Turkey. 

>where he is, who's there, at what force, do they have heavy weapons etc. They could've even asked the weather to see if it's safe for helicopters.

This would have all been available to US forces and CIA assets long in advance. The Turkish intelligence is not better than the US intelligence and the most basic of questions that you asked would not have been shared along intelligence agencies.  Instead as the raid is starting generally chatter appear between intelligence agencies and usually it's something along the lines of ""if you have assets in this area, get the fuck out"".  Most of the time it's your middle level intelligence officers scrambling to protect assets and informants.  While details are never shared because it's a sensitive situation, they scramble to tell each other to avoid the area.  

A lot of times these things are planned months in advance with a million other plans that are never done.  In this case only the top brass and those involved would have even been informed of the situation.  Leaks trickle down in the intelligence community.  When you boss has to go to the situation room, his assistants chatter, and his direct subordinates chatter, and once again they scramble to protect assets.  Unless a foreign country is directly involved or their air space violated, they are not informed.  If it's an air space issue, generally it's as easy as ""we are operating in the area, stay away"".  

If Turkey was even informed, and I doubt they were since Congress wasn't even informed...   But if they were, it would have been as simple as ""get your assets out of the area and stay out of the way""."

>Noone buys games from retail,

And that's how things work in Russia when games are not officially sold there.

>Most people just pirate games,

Yep because you are not the demographic that it's designed to be sold to. That's what you do when you can't buy it.  In America the vast majority actually purchase the games.  That's because we are the targeted demographic to buy the game.  It's marketed and sold to us.  Not to you.   It's literally on a TV commercial every 30 seconds here.  It's not advertised in russia, nor is it sold by a real publisher.
