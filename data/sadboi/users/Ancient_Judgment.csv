TeenMomOGandTeenMom2,f8t2y71,t1_f8rfoxu,1574794654.0,MTV lost me with Amber and her situation. Like I stopped watching everything they make. Then I see something in my YouTube recommendations that just fucking floors me. VH1 is putting El Chapos wife on Cartel Crew and giving her a sympathy/flexing platform. MTV is a garbage fire.

BPD,f4jwgy2,t3_dktvds,1571627691.0,I'm slowly sorting through the things that are actually important to me and trying to write things down. Like real deal breaker behaviours vs things that just make me snap or are a result of my own poor actions ( making the other person react poorly). I find it so difficult to hold onto the things I have decided are my fault vs someone else. It's like everything fades from my mind so easily one minute to the next and everything is 'fine' again. We'll see how it goes.

BPD,f48ullh,t3_djo7no,1571449333.0,"I get this too. I always expose just a little bit more of myself emotionally than a 'regular' person and I guess people are kind of attracted to something out of the norm that seems interesting. I am a bad friend though, I ice people out for no reason (brain just gets tired is the best way to describe it) and it must be very hard on people... Typing this out makes me realise how hurtful that sounds"
BPD,f3owjn2,t3_dheyea,1571031373.0,This idea is super endearing to me. I love it.

AmItheAsshole,f3j1wtm,t3_dfw4kh,1570945658.0,"NTA If it makes you happy then do it, sometimes it's fun being bad. I would only caution that it could be a major scene that overshadows all the effort and money put into the event."
BPD,f3iz2n5,t3_dh2r1z,1570944428.0,"It's possible that moving will help. Make sure you plan it out well and keep up with refining your skills, make the most of the clean slate you afford yourself! My mom has alot of issues and one thing I did manage to learn by observing is that obsessing about certain places that hold a special fascination either from positive past experiences or idealizing a new lifestyle that a particular geography affords is nothing but a waste of time if all you do is plunk your ass down in your new life  and wait for things to magically materialize. I'm just curious, are you talking a move from Oklahoma to Oregon or like from one end of town to the other?"
jerseyshore,f3ijjwj,t1_f3ihaas,1570937553.0,Ugh. It's so shitty and I don't want to agree with you but history says there is a serious non-zero chance that we will see these two get back together. Why on earth would you let the thing expire?
BPD,f3d5fhb,t3_dgiqwg,1570832129.0,It causes the absolute worst rage in me.
BPD,f3aetcn,t3_dg7y1l,1570770422.0,"I find that I absolutely take advantage of the opportunity to edit my online self. Everything comes out too angry, abrasive or jumbled and full of extra useless info in real life. I'm trying to learn to edit on the fly by slowing down my thoughts and trying to think about what I would need from the conversation if I was in the other persons shoes.  Its hard."
