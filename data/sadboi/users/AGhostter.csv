OCD,fhm1pze,t1_fhlyg2v,1581707404.0,"Thank you for addressing that it is abnormal.

I’m sure many people who suffer from OCD and social anxiety would enjoy the pleasure of social situations not impacting their mental state. Easier said than done.

Your advice is sound, but not applicable immediately and constantly at the current moment. I try to push myself to get out of my comfort zone once a day, this situation however was not the one I chose. I also used the flair to vent about it.
 Again, thanks for the advice"
OCD,fhixg6f,t1_fhiwnur,1581633786.0,"I need to see closer to front, that way less computer screens are in front of me which distracts me less. I am also closer to the professor which forces me, personally to remain more attentive. I also like routine and the same schedule, I suppose you don’t need that type of pattern but some people, like myself do. Sitting in a different spot increased my OCD thoughts today and disrupted my pattern.

So in regards to your options:

 I did sit in a different spot because the seat was “saved”. And again, perhaps it would be easy for you to sit in the “saved” spot and deal with the person, but I struggle with social interactions and confrontation. 
Anyways, thank you for your advice, I’ll try to apply it in the future"

Through my time managing the front desk I’ve discovered that is takes about 3 months for new hires to learn how a dental office operates and how to know our software confidently. 
She was struggling quite a bit with the software so I suggested that we start back at square one for a few days to help her.I had this conversation with her one morning before we opened that day, in the front room.
That afternoon she had a meeting with my parents (my mom is the dentist and my dad is the accountant) to let them know that I physically assaulted her and threatened her safety that morning... 
My father said he would review the footage from this morning and asked if she was confident sticking with this statement because it’s extremely serious. She said yes.
Well, my father reviewed our camera footage. She was on one side of the front desk and I was on the other side, about 5 feet away. I was just talking, standing there and then walked away to prepare for the morning. You could also hear me asking her if she would like to start learning the software from the beginning to help, nothing threatening.. 
Anyways she was fired the next day after that."
