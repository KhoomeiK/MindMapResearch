clevercomebacks,fnq0zin,t1_fnptkj3,1587155627.0,"fMRI is the most over hyped tool in psychology. Brain structure and function really just means ""what the brain looks like under fMRI"" in this context. In that sense, literally everything you do and everything that happens to you changes ""brain function and structure"", because brain states ARE psychological states. 

So in that sense, your original comment is correct insofar as it is impossible to act on one's psychological state without acting on the brain. However, it is disingenuous to say that talk therapy acts on the brain "" like medications do"". The goal of a medication is to enact a change in some body functionality, based on the properties of the medication. The goal of talk therapy is to enact a change in psychological states, which trivially requires a change in brain states. The key difference is that talk therapy is not targeted to enact specific brain changes, because we lack the scientific knowledge to design such therapy. Your article even says:

'However, a one to one correspondence between change in depression and change in specific brain areas may be over stated
...
 it also suggests that there is a large overlap in the brain changes associated with different holistic states of consciousness.'

The ability for fMRI to reveal information about psychological states is vastly overestimated by both interested laypeople and some researchers. 
I would personally argue even then he makes too strong a claim regarding the connection between fMRI results and psychological states given the actual evidence he provides, but that is another debate."
