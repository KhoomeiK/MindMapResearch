AMA,fo9wtwk,t1_fo7kfz0,1587633577.0,"Honestly, most university lecturers are there for their research work and just present information. To effectively learn you pretty much have to study yourself heaps and get help from TAs and classmates. It can be intimidating as an introvert but study group chats are useful and you don't even have to interact IRL if it's too hard.

Hey you're on reddit! I'm sure there are heaps of doctors and veterinarians who can help you out here or at least point you in the right direction. And there are newbies in every field - always. The great power of being new is the newer ideas and younger energy we have to offer, and eventually we will be replacing the professionals. So never underestimate that. Most people in professional fields realise this and are always eager to mentor people, you just have to find them, which is difficult for sure, but not impossible.

Yeah this outbreak has ruined it for many, and it sucks. But we will get through this. Good luck on your interview! Go in with a clear head and try your best and after that whatever happens, happens.
Have you checked with the bank on loan deferment or any other adjustment?

I have ups and downs with the lockdown. Somedays are way hard and I don't want to live. Other days are like I'm feeling everything and nothing at all and it's just frustrating, confusing, saddening. Somedays I can keep myself busy, i'm trying to get back into reading but my attention span is that of a carrot lol so it can be hard. But i'm trying not to give up. I wish it was easier, that's all."

AMA,fo7ig5q,t1_fo7gfr0,1587578881.0,"Yes definitely. A lot of times the theory males sense but practically it can be harder to make it work. Lots of trial and error goes in. But you also have to be smart about it and narrow down the trials to what would likely work than not.
Nah I definitely feel you, studying has been very difficult for me. And I'm graduating after many fails and slogging through the degree.

Biology is fantastic! I've always admired people who are good at it, cause I definitely suck.
That's a good dream to have, you should definitely consider following through.
And I know what you went through. University can be very overwhelming. I too spiraled into severe depression after my first semester. Take the time off. Relax. Volunteer at shelters and be around animals when the quarantine is over- I'm sure they bring you a lot of joy! Talk to more people in the industry and use that to gauge if you still want to pursue being a veterinarian.

I understand. My parents were difficult too. I was lucky enough that I found some work and kind of threw myself at it to distract myself and eventually moved out again. But it definitely must be harder amidst the lockdown. That sucks. But you're not at fault for taking time off. I hope you're finding things to keep yourself occupied."
AMA,fo7flkc,t1_fo7esav,1587577502.0,"To me electrical engineering is like voodoo. Some of the courses I'd to take were definitely not easy.  But you can be working on designing a phone regardless of three engineering discipline.

Primitive views are not bad as long as you're always asking questions and building up on them :)

Hey, don't beat yourself up. Did you have a major in your first semester? Which courses did you enjoy and do well in during high school?
And I think it is a good decision to drop and figure out what you like than just tread away through classes."
AMA,fo7dwij,t1_fo7ce64,1587576677.0,"I wanted to do fine arts when i was in high school. But also knew I need money to survive and my art probably isn't good enough to sell. I was decent at the sciences and was always fascinated by space and technology and chose to do engineering. In my time studying I took two gaps and both times considered switching majors but just switched from mechatronics to mechanical but still within the engineering domain. Didn't switch to anything else cause I just didn't know what else I like and would help me get work even know many engineering classes were difficult and made me miserable.

What you're thinking of is very classical engineering. Most engineers back in the day worked on building things- trains, bridges, buildings. But now it's in a everything around. Microprocessors in a phone, designing cameras, headphones everything.
But also in other domains, in recent years engineers have been in demand in financial sectors too because of the critical thinking we have. It does require some upskilling and training but it's very doable. So I guess we are everywhere! Haha"
AMA,fo7c0lf,t1_fo7bjba,1587575761.0,"I think sometimes it can be. Especially in engineering you can immerse yourself in studying and gain valuable skills and be appreciated.
Loans are hard though, I don't blame you. 

Wow I..honestly don't know. With everything going on I'll literally do any engineering job that I can get my hands on. I'm not particularly passionate about anything. But I've worked in project management and supply chain management so I'd be comfortable in those niches I suppose."

It's okay you're okay. Everything is rough out there. It's only fair you're having a panic attack so strong. But we can get through this. I hope in the moments when you breathe in, you can remind yourself that things will be fine someday again and find some calm in that. Online school can be hard and I'm sure you're doing your best. Just keep at it, whatever it may be. It's just another hurdle to get through and I'm certain you'll make it. Take care and stay safe."

That helps.
I guess sometimes when I'm okay with being upset about my situation I start questioning if I have a victim complex and am just ""pretending"" to be sick(or anything disadvantaged) just so I don't have to take responsibility for my actions. How do I work around this?
I do end up feeling very guilty about stuff. Like last month I had a cancer scare, I still don't know if I do have it or don't, in middle of all the tests. And I sometimes just think about that and can't focus on school and assessments and then feel heaps guilty cause I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do even though I'm still physically able. And being in the wrong mindset just ends up leading to misplacing my energy. Have you had to work around something similar and how did you?"
