myfriendwantstoknow,fmx3m9v,t3_fxo4v0,1586457868.0,"Hi! Most studies on mental health treatments show that medication alongside therapy is proven to be the most effective way to treat mental health issues. Any primary care provider would probably prescribe a frontline SSRI or SNRI that isn‚Äôt habit forming and can really help with depression symptoms and make you more open to the benefits of therapy. Like someone else said people with depression are just trying to get through the day, medication can help them get back to a functional level that can allow them to get to the root of their issues and eventually get off medications. I work with psychiatrist and they say it‚Äôs normal to stay on them from anywhere between 6 months to a year or even the rest of your life, for most people they are very safe medications.

As for therapy, if you‚Äôre in the US you can checkout psychology today, it is a magazine but they‚Äôre website has a therapist finder in your area and they are all verified and have info and details about their practice. Their contact info is on there as well. The thing about therapy is that you have to find a therapist that work for you so it‚Äôs never a bad idea to shop around if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable with the first few. Hope this helps and that your friend is able to help out his brother!!

I forgot to add, the thing with mental health is that you can only help that person as much as they are willing to let you help them. Really all you can do is provide and solace for when that person is ready to get better. What I‚Äôm trying to say is that you can‚Äôt force someone to seek out treatment but you sure can support them in their decisions and let them know that you‚Äôre there if you need them. Educating them and giving them resources could also help open their mind."
