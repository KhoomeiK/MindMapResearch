depression,foul4us,t3_g9n8rh,1588086046.0,"I've heard that Lists can sometimes be helpful. 

Try making a list of things you want to get done the night before and make sure to make the tasks small and quick to do. Put the quickest ones first and go down the list. 

The objective is to not take much time to think and just go through the tasks. 

It might take up enough time to get you through the morning and might make you feel like you accomplished a lot which might make you feel better the rest of the day. 

&#x200B;

I personally suggest trying out different things that people here are suggesting and see which one works best for you."
depression,foukm2x,t1_foud7tt,1588085786.0,"I don't think intermittent fasting is nonsense. I do think that if you don't have to then you shouldn't do it but it can be useful in some cases.

I personally get bloated whenever i have breakfast, so skipping breakfast and just waiting for lunch feels more normal for me. It also helps me feel more alert in the morning and helps me focus better. 

I can't say that doing intermittent fasting doesn't have its drawbacks and issues, but for me it's worth it for the benefits i get. It's just a matter of weighing out the pros and cons"
depression,fouj09k,t3_g9ndgw,1588084955.0,"I think i know how you feel. 

For me it is more like i died a long time ago and i'm just kind of going through a ""What if I hadn't died"" phase or at least that's how i see it. 

I think the memory part has more to do with it feeling like things don't really matter since i'm already ""dead"". Pictures help if you want to make sure you don't forget some things. Objects can also help a bit. 

I find that smells sometimes remind me of things and emotions as well."
