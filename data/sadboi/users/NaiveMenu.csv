My best guess is she probably got in contact with said ministry and told them God knows what so that they can watch over me while away at college so she wouldn’t have to be worried sick about what I could be possibly up to.

I’d suggest you search any college campus ministry and once you get a name do a deeper background search and check the pedigree of that particle ministry. Even type the ministries name with “escaped” or “cult” on YouTube and I’m sure you’ll find former members talking about the crap they went through to leave. Shits crazy!

It seems so far fetched but you’d be surprised how common this tactic is with many evangelical heavy Christian ministries. ESPECIALLY around college campuses where they prey on the vulnerability and naivety of students who are just trying to find there way. Smh!

TalkTherapy,fjx6a22,t3_ff9fls,1583658708.0,"I can relate to what your going through. Specifically the not being able to express myself because the focus is on carrying the conversation. 

Have you considered jotting down the things you want to express during a session the night before? That way when you see your therapist you can focus on carrying the conversation without the frustration of forgetting what you came there for. 

So when your therapist finally gets to the “what’s on your mind/what brought you in” part you can whip out your note pad and go one bullet point at a time. 

When I was I therapy,  between sessions i would pull out my phones notepad and jot down whatever I wanted to discuss during the next session and labeled the note “therapy notes” and locked it.

It’s an entire organization of people who participate in this crap so it’s not easy getting a harassment or stalking claim to stick. Also since there is free speech in America as well as public property(the lake I visit) evangelizing in those areas isn’t a crime. (Think about those religious fanatics on the side of the street yelling during pro events/concerts). It’s not against the law. On private property it gets a little trickier. I can call the cops and say this guy is following me around in the store or whatever. I’d more then likely be told the person is allowed to shop where they like since they are paying customers. If it was the same people doing the GS it’ll be so much easier to report them, however when the people vary by age/sex/weight/etc. it’s pretty damn hard to make a case for stalking when you’ve only seen them ONCE.

Anxiety,f84qrod,t3_dwtr8q,1574258279.0,"I’ve had many psychs over the years & just as many opinions on what could be going on with me. For some silly reason I held the docs opinion about my mental health over my own self advocacy. I would go to appointments and value a strangers assumption over my 26 years of living w/ myself.  This wasted so much time/energy/money. You end up becoming the docs lab rat and trust me that is no fun. 

I’ve been seeking treatment for yearsssss and it wasn’t until a month ago that I had enough of docs making educated guesses. I switched to a new psych & told myself that my voice matters & should be taken seriously. I started advocating for my mental health & became assertive and direct during appointments.

Before I would go to my doc and pour my emotions out with hopes they’d see how much crap I’ve been dealing with & treat me accordingly. This method wasted so much time because I left too much on the table for them to assume.

Now I don’t leave anything for assumption. When I go to my appts, I let the doctor know EXACTLY what I need to be treated for.

“I’m seeking treatment for anxiety, depression, moodswings, etc...”

If the doctor doesn’t agree with what your seeking treatment for then that becomes a secondary issue. I paid to have this visit with a doc to discuss treatment for the issue I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH. I’m no longer a lab rat or test subject for the doc & I’m in control of my treatment plan.

Do not blindly let your psych doc do as he pleases. Trust your self, be assertive & direct, ask for what you want, and don’t leave ANYTHING on the table for chance or assumption. Speak in a manner that lets them know to take you seriously  & most importantly RESEARCH!

If you research your potential diagnosis front and back including first lines of treatment etc. you’ll be in and out of the docs office with exactly what you came there for.

I’ve been through the ringer & it wasn’t until I was fed up that I started to grow a pair & stand up for my own mental health. Things will only go up from there.

Good Luck!"
