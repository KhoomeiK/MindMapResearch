The issue shouldn't be him using your biggest dildo and ridding it like a pro, that's something you have to work on accepting. Him like that isn't an issue.

The issues for me are keeping it a secret and using your dildoes. You seem pretty open and I think you would have no problem with him having his own dildoes. But since he has kept it a secret, therefore (I think) he can't buy his own dildoes with out making you ask him about it, he uses yours, completely unsanitary.

There is nothing wrong with him masturbating and wanting privacy on that issue (though making a video of it...suspicious) but he looks down on you when you do it,so there must be something behind that. I don't need to now how exactly my couple masturbates, but from what you wrote, this is something he has been doing as a kid, it is something important for him and it seem weird he has kept it a secret.

He seems to just undermine anything gay and yet keeps making jokes...he seems closeted or maybe has some issues, you should definitely talk about this in an open and loving matter, create and ambient were he can express himself and whatever question you have, don't sound judgemental.

And well, most of all, talk with you  therapist  about it, they will have a better understanding and process to handle all of this.

That is part of being on a show (I, wouldnt do it because I am way too sensitive and would spend all the time crying). I dislike people trying to censor other people.

Don't believe the whole he had a gf, because he wouldn't have involved his mom. But I also don't believe him as a naive man either. I think it was a combination of being 24 and believing stupidly things could change but also knowing and wanting to stay on the show."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj107wf,t1_fizuvyk,1582910698.0,"This got me. I wouldnt call her a sociopath, but...that smile. Like even Jessica had the character to not act all happy, she recognize someone got hurt and while she made a decision that was good for her and had nothing to feel sorry for saying no, I also felt realized that Mark was hurt. 

Meanwhile Kelly...smiles."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fj0zi0h,t1_fj0qewk,1582910318.0,"This so much! For me it was the reaction of both men. I saw Mark being ready to get a No, like things could go either way, but I didn't see Kenny ready for that.   


"" even Jessica didn’t do that, and people hate her for trying to see if she could develop chemistry with Mark. And damn did she try. "" Also this. I dislike Jessica for her interactions with Barnett and Amber, and while I also dislike that she sometimes lead Mark on, I also felt her hesitation of trying since they had good chesmitry on the pods and also letting Mark know she wasn't into him, yeah, in a bad way and to a Mark who had rose-colored glasses...but at least she tried."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fixq2nj,t1_fixa3jr,1582824835.0,I can't with this! 😂😂😂
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fixprgt,t1_fixjk0c,1582824691.0,Tell more. Did he say yes hoping she would say yes or to create some drama?
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fixpfzo,t1_fix8wb6,1582824545.0,"A part of me is hoping they already did a season 2 of LIB. Just like they kept season 1 quiet through 2018, I could picture already having a season 2 on the works."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fixdolr,t1_fiwo5d5,1582818330.0,Would believe this if she had just acted uncomfortable... But the way she acted with Barnett and Amber...naaah
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fix9wy3,t1_fiwo6hk,1582816055.0,"Yeah have a hard time believing that account. The way she treated Barnett and Amber is not what a real ""sweetheart"" would act."

tifu,fibe8dy,t1_fib1cso,1582320113.0,Wth at thinking the gf has a certain level of responsibility....ughh. Twisted kind of thinking.
tifu,fibdale,t1_fib7kyj,1582319559.0,I feel he remembers more than he wants to admit. Something must have happened for him to want to go to her room. I feel so bad for the gf.
tifu,fibbwwq,t1_fiapzj1,1582318737.0,"How did you know she was wet? You went to her room and just touched her there or what? Feel there is more to this story you don't wanna tell...

Either way all my sympathy goes to your gf. Hope this doesn't traumatize her for future relationships, if I was her, for sure I would. You should go to therapy and tbh stay away from alcohol, drugs and your cousin. Or if you still want with your cousin ( ew) at least try not to hurt other people."
TheCircleTV,fi7ovvz,t1_ffbdarc,1582225426.0,"My fave was Seaburn, the rest kept trying to make it about family and connections and being genuine and that was the most important thing...naaaaah, they all wanted to win. So for me Seaburn was playing the game, was being a contestant and he never had to change. He acted according what was going on...being in a reality show where you win by being the popular one. 
Joey was also a strategist and many times I felt he pushed the whole "" we are fam"" agenda."

videos,fh1j1im,t1_fgx49oo,1581216311.0,I am so sorry this happened to you. So unfair and painful. As a woman I feel completed disgusted by it and ashamed such acts can be overlooked because of gender.
instantkarma,fh1f8xs,t1_fh1b9x5,1581214438.0,"Okay , have the last word. You obviously need it. Maybe you are having a bad week and need a win, despite being a terrible win. So have the last word.

But, as promised... Disgust for Woody Allen has grown 10%!"
instantkarma,fh173ib,t1_fh15ng7,1581211530.0,"Omg! You are just a troll because I can't imagine why you are so invested on this to even mention anything about Amber Heard. I have not defended her and find it disgusting what she did. That doesn't make Woody Allen less disgusting in my eyes. And no, I will never feel bad for Woody, he keeps making money and living a good lofe...so booo hooo people dislike him. Welcome to being a celeborty. People will hate you or love you. Soooo...You know what...Everytime you answer me, my disgust for Woody Allen will grow 10% more."
instantkarma,fgz4s3i,t1_fgz210c,1581190717.0,"Not even gonna click that right now because lol...yeah Woody is a martyr of people who has been shunned by society, he is even in jail..oh wait.... Woody isn't innocent, but guess what? Unlike many who has been accused falsely, he is still free, still making movies and livingn his life. So what do you gain from all of this? The guy already won and you won't even consider Dylan's words...sooo, does it really matter to you if many people, including me, find him disgusting, when nothing wrong is happening to him? I hope that you are actually in other post defending people who are actually in jail. And yet you are defending a free men with no real repercussions. Again. The only thing I said about him ( and this has been the only moment that I said anything about Dylan because I actually respect her and with a person like you , I wouldn't go as low to use her) was that I found disgusting that he got involved with the child of his partner. It wouldnt matter if it was a woman or non-white, that fact alone makes him disgusting to me ( the rest makes him unbearable to me, but that was not my point) and making him look like a heroe who got tainted...pfffttttt. I can see him crying and wiping his tears with his money because I find him disgusting."

I don't wanna waste my time linking you stuff that discredits it...for what? So you can keep this campaign? I think he is disgusting for getting married with the child of his partner. Period. Will you change my mind? No. Will it matter in your life if I think he is disgusting and horrible? No. Will I be okay after checking this post with still thinking he is disgusting? Yeah. Will you be okay with me still thinking like that? Probably not, but I guess you can always read again articles that defend him and ignore those who disagree with you."

relationships,fdzuokj,t3_encilj,1578796218.0,"OP, if you are not comfortable in a poly relationship, don't be. You are not being selfish for not wanting to be in one. As well as he isn't selfish in wanting to be poly. What would be wrong is just thinking of his happiness. You happiness matters, you matter and you get to think and decide what you want from a relationship.

I would never be comfortable and if my couple ever wants to, even if it hurts as fuck, I wouldn't want to be with him and make us both unhappy with how sad the whole situation would be."
