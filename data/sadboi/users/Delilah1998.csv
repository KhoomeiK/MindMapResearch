There's nothing at all wrong with staying in the relationship and accepting her changes, there is also nothing at all wrong with losing your attraction and leaving the relationship.

Having sex with someone you care about/love is entirely different than with some random person you met at the bar. I can honestly say that only 1/3 one night stands were actually good, the other two were really disappointing. You basically go home after a drunken night with a stranger feeling unfulfilled and a little depressed to be frank with you. That's just my personal experience. 

I'm single at the moment and would definitely trade my current life of being able to sleep with whoever I want (and being tested for STDs and STIs) with being in a loving relationship. Some of my close friends have slept with 10, 20,50 people and they say the same thing."
