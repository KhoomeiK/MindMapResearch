Yeah, he's gotten better, but if you ever listened to Harmontown, he definitely expressed fear of trying things in the last several years. Especially if he won't have full control. He was always afraid of getting fired after the network decided they didn't want him in charge of community anymore. Hence the Gas Leak Year. 

That's why he was so happy when Adultswim did that huge contract to keep Rick and Morty going, he has it stipulated in his contract that he can't be fired. 

I think with Community, he doesn't want to mess it up, and it be bad. It's so highly anticipated. Getting the money for Glover wouldn't be an issue. Working around his schedule would be a little harder, but still doable."

The episode is called Hair Day, and it goes into the different options Black women have for dealing with their hair, apart from going natural. 

Essentially textured hair was considered ugly for so long. So black women did what they could to find ways to fit in with white women's beauty standards. 

The episode covers what happens if a Black Woman wants to go from having treated hair, to going natural, which means they have to cut off all of the treated hair, and start from the beginning, or if a wig is the option, or treating the hair. 

Its a very complex issue that many women deal with, and the episode is great at explaining it to people like myself, who have never had to deal with culture telling me my hair is wrong."
