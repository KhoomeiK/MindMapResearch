mentalhealth,fpeaepx,t3_gcx69t,1588543575.0,"I'm not sure about your preexisting conditions, but the body can take a ton of abuse for a long time from drugs and alcohol before permenant organ damage occurs.  There are exceptions, of course, like having terrible nutrition for two years because of heavy meth use or drinking a bottle of vodka a day for more than a few years, but the human body can take an ass whipping without permenant damage... especially for people under 30.

The two ways alcohol causes brain damage is vitamin B deficiency and acute glutamine neurotoxicity.  The vitamin b deficiency is caused by a mix of destroyed stomach lining that physically can't absorb vitamins after heavy, chronic alcohol consumption and poor nutrition.  Brain damage induced by Glutamate excito-toxicity is caused by trying to detox yourself when your physically dependent on alcohol cold-turkey or repeated heavy binge drinking.  This is a result of the alcohol leaving your system as opposed to alcohol intoxication, so it can be prevented with treatment.  Also, it's much more common in heavy benzo users then alcohol users.

With this being said, it is unlikely that you have alcohol induced brain damage yet unless you were drinking to the point of alcohol poisoning during those 5 years.

My theory is that changing their diagnosis would admit fault and open them up for a lawsuit.  It was better to not run any tests that might prove what I was saying was correct and for me to just go away... unfortunately for them, I didnt.

Over the course of the week, I rapidly lost weight, about 20-30% of my weight and kept checking in. I wan wondering the streets aimlessly, not knowing what was going on. My friends, random people, and my friends kept on calling cops and paramedics, but they would keep on bringing me to the same hospital, and the doctor would say, ""it's all in your head"".  I tried calling every number  I could find and was instructed to call 911, but they kept on telling me to go to the emergency room.  I even walked like 10 miles to the next hospital over when it was clear they wouldn't run any tests.  They knew me At this point.  Unfortunately, at their other locations, they would see my paperwork and of course me out immediatly. I didn't want narcotics like librium, just antiseizure medication or any tests to make sure my organs were okay from the rapid weight loss.  For about a month I was taking equivalent to 2 or 3 xanex and 10 valium a day ..so it was severe and life threatening.

After about 3 weeks of this, maybe more, I was pulled over for dangerous driving. I was a few towns over, but the hospital was ran by the same company.  At this point I had pretty much lost everything, and I knew checking in was pointless.  The police and paramedics said I could go home, but if I let them take me to the hospital they would make sure I was taken...the only catch is I would have to give up my car and my life that was in it to the impound. I did.

At this hospital, she tried to pull up my files, and they were blocked.  She was like, ""I don't understand what's going on, let me call my supervisor"". They tried to harrass me into leaving ama, I guess so they weren't culpable if something happened.  The stuff they did at this point is so fucked up that no one would believe, so I won't bother, but they fucked with me into leaving town.  It was scary.  It was probably because when they didn't treat me, I was going to all the homeless shelters and Church events telling them what I was going through.  I was on a delusional mission to publicize what they were doing to me and homeless people.

All that is fine and dandy, but now they are seizing my tax money to pay for my treatments.  That's the line.  Luckily, a employee at a local public mental health facility did check my urine for benzos during that time period, and I have Enough paramedic and cop visits on record from the time to coroberate my story.

There was damage from the lack of treatment.  I understand I am a drug addict, but that is a medical disease and withdrawing is a real medical risk.  Psychologically, mainly from the harrassment, I was terrified for about 6 months. Like, terrified of these people.  I survived, sure, but that shouldn't make it alright.  What they are doing is wrong.

I don't know what to tell you.  Personally, it's not surprising that your SO acted in this manner.  People are naturally selfish and they will act in their own self interest if and when they can get away with it.  People do with they want.

Unfortunately, your significant other does not want to be in a monogamous relationship with you.  Like, I think all guys want to have sex with every girl that would say yes and they are attracted to, but alot of them would compromise....say to themselves, ""well, I want to fuck that other girl, but this girl is such a good friend that it's not worth losing her and she cooks good too."". This isn't the case with your guy.  As long as he has the emotional leverage, he will do what he wants.  Your best bet is to make steps towards being more emotionally and financially independent.  It could be enough to make him legitimately want you again, but based on his character, why would you even want that."

Ultimately, the losers will be bussinesses that can't find employees to work for what they are willing to pay them...at least right now...the winners will be larger companies that can take the hit, pay a little more, and survive during the four months of worker shortages.

I understand that this is to support people in large, high cost cities like New York and Los Angeles, but in poorer, rural areas essential workers are refusing to work and self-sabotoging their jobs because unemployment is paying more than they could ever hope to make doing farming or manufacturing work.

A larger than you might think percentage of the unemployment claims are workers that are either refusing to work as a form of socioeconomic protest or who harrassed their employers into shutting down.

I know it's not right, but I actually hate my employer for allowing me to work and am going to find a new job as a matter of principle.  I can't work for an employer that would cheat me out of a paycheck double than what they are willing to pay me.

What gets me is they had to have seen this coming.  I don't understand what they are playing at...like, is this some fucked up political tactic to cause civil unrest?

What's even more positive is that people might realize that an economy dependent on people spending all of their money on what might turn out to be inefficient, unnecessary crap is inherently unsustainable.  There is so much more people can be doing with their lives than spending all their time working jobs that can be automated by machines, building machines that are designed to break, using energy designed to be expensive and inefficient...on top of it all, alot of poorer people have to spend 70% of their income just for the privilege of owning a car and having a place to live.

Like, old money and power that is passed through the generations, but new players come in.  The money doesn't matter once your this high up-influence matters more.  Money is a plaything of the bottom 98%.  Since these people control government, they can make money.

One way they get power is to provide a service or item that is indispsensable, but must be continually replaced.  Apple in China is a good example of this.  The Chinese government tried to shut them down in favor of their own cell phone companies, but the people protested.  Even though they have 10 generations of iPhones already developed and can arguably make it sturdy to the point where it would last ten years, they don't do that.  They could make alot of money, but they lose the power since society could function for 10 years on the cellphones already produced.

The owners of these new technology would be the new players...the new dynasties that are forming.  The oil dynasties are examples of old dynasties that either need to evolve or their line will perish.  Oil is cyclical-the new energy sources are not.  The reason we have global warming is because the emperor's of the oil dynasty or whatever do not want to relinquish power.  If they don't find another way to maintain it, which there is none in terms of clean energy, they will lose their societal indispensability and therefore their power.

Or, they could be inventive, and provide a new service to maintain power.  (Facebook, Google, iPhones)

Fortunately for us, enough new dynasties are forming to kick them out of power if they don't evolve.  Unfortunately,though,  in the case of oil, it might be too late for the planet.

Money used to be controlled by physical possession, which made it possible for an individual to obtain wealth, in this system it is impossible.  Money no longer exists yet it has the power to buy a government.  It's a Killswitch to prevent new dynasties from competing with the already established ones.  Since they control government and government prints money, they can make a new-comers money worthless.

Efficiency is an enemy to the statis quo.

Don't get me wrong, for most of human history we needed religion and manipulation to keep humans from destroying ourselves, but that was in a time when scarcity was a real problem.
