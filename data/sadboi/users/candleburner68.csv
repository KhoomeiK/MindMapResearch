AmItheAsshole,fj7nwoo,t3_fbv7ty,1583094426.0,"NTA!!! This guy clearly has some growing up to do. I would have done the EXACT same thing you did. How else would you prove that you‚Äôre on your period (not that you should need to ever ‚Äúprove‚Äù that in the first place)? I think this situation revealed a lot and you dodged a major bullet. Him and his family can think whatever they want, just know they are CRAZY and you are NOT ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù for what you did!!"
mentalhealth,fil06hq,t3_f8elfc,1582490829.0,"I think everyone just responds and copes with emotions differently. Some people cry in response to a lot of emotions, some people bunch holes in walls in response to a lot of emotions. I do not think it is anything abnormal. The issue a lot of people (including myself) face is society‚Äôs perspective on crying. They think it is a sign of weakness or it‚Äôs babyish. I say f*ck them. If you feel like crying... let it flow. Emotional release is good."
selfimprovement,fikk1pr,t3_f89j3y,1582481814.0,"I describe those thoughts (at least when I get them) as intrusive and unproductive. When I try hard to not think about them, it only gets worse. So instead, I like to adknowledge the thought and just talk it out inside my head and let myself experience it again so my mind will shut the f*ck up about it! Also, writing it down can be a really good way to get it out of your head. Also just remember, embarrassing stuff happens to everyone and everyone has recurring memories of something they did a long time ago. But it is also okay if it still haunts you every once and a while. What matters is how you cope with it :)"
mentalhealth,fikjg3s,t3_f89un5,1582481500.0,"I think the hardest part about it is that when people treat you that way, it makes it seem like it is totally in your control. Like you somehow do have control over it and you just are letting it get out of control. When in reality, you have absolutely no control over it and people just dont understand. So frustrating"
mentalhealth,fhiok3s,t1_fhio9nu,1581628774.0,I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. I understand that everyone copes differently but some people have no humanity at all i swear

Nurse,feyohta,t3_eqny8h,1579448295.0,Epocrates is a great app to quickly look up drugs (it‚Äôs free too!) I know it isn‚Äôt a book but I am also in nursing school and I am taking pharm right now and it has saved me
NursingStudent,fek4z1v,t1_fek4mtx,1579192717.0,Thank you!
AskDocs,fe2zz4m,t3_enj2v9,1578844641.0,I would try to schedule another appt with your doctor. You mentioned that you have been in more pain since your last exam. Breast pain/lumps can cause SOOOO much anxiety in women (that is why the American Cancer Society no longer even recommends self-breast exams if you have an average risk of cancer!) Also you are going back to school soon and there is already enough stress in that alone. If you would feel more comfortable getting it checked now then get it checked NOW. Any doctor should be accomodating to your anxiety/needs. Hope this helped!
NursingStudent,fdsilym,t1_fdsihi2,1578703449.0,"Okay, thank you. Good luck on your nclex!"
NursingStudent,fdshvg0,t3_emykcy,1578703045.0,"As a current student, I have a lot of anxiety arround:

-transitioning into the nursing field after school
-mean instructors/other nurses
-imposter syndrome
-staying out of/knowing when to leave toxic work environments

I think any of these topics would be super beneficial! You could also share how you studied for exams, prepared for clinicals, and passed your NCLEX! If you do happen to start a blog, please let me know! I would love to use it as a resource!"
mentalhealth,fdshior,t3_emwi3w,1578702858.0,This is so awesome!! I have so much trouble with this in my classes as well. Very proud‚ù§Ô∏è
obgyn,fdrl9ec,t1_fdrkuk0,1578686163.0,I have a PCP but he has told me before that he has no OB/GYN experience and would not feel qualified/comfortable enough to prescribe me anything. Thank you for the help! I will look into it
mentalhealth,fdrcy1k,t3_emu18q,1578682693.0,"I am so sorry you are feeling this way. So many mothers feel this way because during pregnancy the baby is idolized and no one gives a shit about the mom even though you are the awesome one carrying it(like your SO‚Äôs family)! It is very sad and I want you to know that even if you do not feel strong right now, it will pass. Pregnancy can make you very hormonal and all of these negative thoughts and ideas may be a result of it. There are so many mental health resources for pregnant mothers and mothers with post partum depression. I suggest seeking one of those resources especially because of the suicidal thoughts/ideations that you mentioned. You do not have to be alone in this mental journey. I am sure your baby wants to grow up with a happy momma. Best of luck to you <3"
mentalhealth,fdrbmls,t3_emv7gf,1578682129.0,"It seems like you have exhausted a lot of options! Kudos to you for trying to make a change. If I were you, I would see your PCP and have them recommend you to a specialist if they cannot help. If you have already tried that then maybe there is a deeper, psychological issue that you need to find out. It seems like you have a lot of anxiety built up around this so it might be helpful to talk to someone about it. Hope this helps!"
obgyn,fdraw5f,t3_ekni7q,1578681903.0,"This is not weird AT ALL!!!! Everyone has sex at different ages (or never) and that is OKAY. The whole social construct of ‚Äúvirginity‚Äù is so outdated and honestly harmful for young people. Do not ever allow doctors/people/TV shows tell you you‚Äôre weird. Also, I have been around some judgemental doctors who were rude when I told them I HAVE had sex. So it can honestly go either way. 

Regardless, if a doctor makes you feel as if you are in an untheraputic, judgemental environment because of it. LEAVE!! Walk out the damn door! Find a new doctor that respects YOU and your choices. Period."
obgyn,fdr9sdd,t3_el5zm5,1578681515.0,"How you feel while on the placebo pill will probably be similar to how you feel without the pills at all. This could change though because naturally during the menstrual cycle, different levels of hormones are present so you may feel more emotional/less emotional at certain times. Birth control pills are so tricky and I suggest just documenting the next couple months without the pill. Maybe right down in a journal when you feel like PMS symptoms are at their peak and when you feel good! Maybe you will find you like being on the birth control better or you will find that you feel better without it. Then, if you want to go back on the pill I would report the info back to your doctor."
obgyn,fdr7agu,t1_fdr6wf5,1578680497.0,Thank you for taking the time to reply! This whole situation has been a mess and I just posted this to get some clarity in this whirlwind of emotions I am feeling. This was very helpful. I hope you find a birth control that works for you!
obgyn,fdr70lz,t1_fdr5tv6,1578680336.0,"Holy shit thank you SO MUCH for taking the time to respond back to me!This was so helpful. It is just hard because I actually really like my usual ob/gyn but she is always so busy and impossible to get an appointment with. The closest PP to me is 30 mins away but I will look into it! As far as the Zoloft goes, that is exactly what I thought but I wasn‚Äôt 100% so I didn‚Äôt want to say that to her. Thank you for validating my feelings. When I called about the bad ob/gyn they treated me like I crazy!"
obgyn,fdfpfjx,t1_fdfpbt3,1578367054.0,Thank you so much for sharing your experience with me. This helps a LOT!
sex,fdc8nzv,t3_ekjkrm,1578269269.0,"If you feel like it is a situation where you are unsure if you should ask, just ask!! It is better to be safe than sorry. I think this is a great question and I am glad you are trying to learn more. Also, if you are consistently with the same partner then just have a casual conversation about it. ‚ÄúDo I need to ask you first? Or should I just do it?‚Äù Simple questions like this can spark a very helpful and clarifying conversation."
sex,fd5h2z4,t3_ejzbej,1578177572.0,"My birth control affects my sex drive drastically. It is usually only up for maybe a week out of the whole month of my cycle (i take the pill 21 days on, 7 days off. The 7 days I do not take it is when my sex drive is higher) If you feel like that is the issue, discuss it with your OBGYN at your next appointment!"
mentalhealth,fc65yd3,t1_fc603oj,1577473029.0,Thank you for taking the time to answer. I am always such a control freak and I feel like if I don‚Äôt have control over a situation it can go very poorly. Maybe that is something I can write down to talk about! Thank you once again for the tips:)
mentalhealth,fc65sxs,t1_fc5lqj9,1577472931.0,Thank you so much for taking the time to write back to me. That in itself means a lot. It sounds like you are studying and pursuing the right field! But ultimately thank you for understanding my question and answering in a theraputic way. I think I will be making an appointment after reading this.
obgyn,fc40z0j,t1_fc40wgc,1577403765.0,Thank you so much for your help! Happy Holidays üòä
mentalhealth,fblpi6z,t3_edvj5l,1576966950.0,"I feel this so much. I have severe anxiety and I tend to never live in the present. I easily allow my triggers to cause me to over think and I think about all of the things that I have to do in the future and it causes me to not be productive in the present if that makes sense. So before my negative thoughts and worries about the future can start to spiral out of control I think to myself ‚ÄúWhat do I have to do right NOW‚Äù. Or ‚ÄúWhat can I do right now instead of thinking like this?‚Äù Then I prioritize that and it distracts me so then I forget about what I was anxious about before. 

When I am with friends or family or a situation where I should be enjoying my self and I am overthinking about the future or other things. I try to use grounding techniques. They are super common if you haven‚Äôt used them before. They help me to kind of bring my head out of the clouds and help me to be where I need to be mentally. I hope this helped even a little!"
