Anxiety,flguc8o,t3_for25u,1585150469.0,totally agree with you. when I don’t endlessly search all the covid articles and just stay away i feel like life (in my home) is almost normal and safe. i had to tell myself that there is nothing new to see on it and I have all the info I need about trying to stay safe. the news is a horrific fuel for anxiety
Anxiety,fktqsb0,t3_fkayil,1584531488.0,yup. same. i’ve thought I had it since March 1 and I document every time I have been in public and start my monitoring of 2-14 days out. i’m popping a klonopin daily.
AskReddit,fjjxo8h,t1_fj4nors,1583415140.0,i agree with this x 100!!!! why is it never addresses when we have flu season/outbreaks? they’ll tell you wash your hands a million times but the finger lick page turning thing is never mentioned!!!!INFURIATING!!!
findapath,ff5svhv,t3_erhme0,1579608971.0,nope. waste of money on a couple of schools. went mostly for art. managed to get a BFA so I suppose that was worth it just to look good on a resume. Been working office jobs and am now in pharma. make a ton of money but it’s soul crushing. If I had it to do over again would probably do something with law or psychology. oh ya...44 and still paying back loans
oneanddone,ff2tmri,t3_epjv5g,1579523664.0,"I have one son and he loves being an only. He never expressed a desire for a sibling and even when I asked him if he wanted one he said “NO”. He sees friends with siblings arguing and such and knows how good he has it in our peaceful home. He’s intelligent, well mannered, well-liked and social...and HAPPY.  As far as real life experiences with siblings - I have a sister and I frequently felt lonely in childhood because of our 3 year age difference. We did not always get along and even now as adults I keep my distance at times. Personality clash. My husband is 1 of 6 and is the only one that had a child. So many fights and estrangement between them all. It’s really uncomfortable to be around. 
So the whole “give your child a sibling for their own good” argument is crap. The whole onlies are selfish and maladjusted theory is total bullsh*t. I don’t know why our society feels the need to make the minority group (families with one child) look abnormal. I want to tell them to STFU and go back to the herd."
KyloRen,fcp22xo,t3_ef76ya,1577848099.0,that’s beautiful
Anxiety,fb7c0uo,t3_ebryuu,1576584628.0,lived with anxiety and health anxiety for most of my life. every day is a struggle to change thoughts and to mitigate anxiety. it’s work and you have to consciously try to reframe the thoughts. I get it. I totally do and there are really bad periods for me sometimes where it’s absolute misery. some therapy helped but doesn’t cure you. it blows man but keep working at it. see all the good things in life.
Anxiety,fb7biif,t3_ebp5cx,1576584001.0,yes. all the time. If after the second try things are still a total bust I give up. I’m shy and I know I have to give it extra effort but there are some people I can’t break through too. probably  good too- they probably have the worst sense of humor or no sense of humor anyway.
jobs,ewe5knd,t3_bca8mi,1565315012.0,I feel exactly the same. I was a sellout and got a cushy office job which led to a golden handcuffs situation. What’s the term now “comfortably miserable”? All the advice I read on how to cope isn’t helping either like try to find something about your job you like and expand on that. Give me a break. The best thing about it is the paycheck. If I left tomorrow I wouldn’t give a second thought to that place or that terrible position. I’ve done so much thinking about how to get out of this that I can’t think about it anymore. There’s really no good solution right now.
