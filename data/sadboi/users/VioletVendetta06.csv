They want to deny that attitude has any affect on attractiveness but attitude is the entire reason they hate western women and idolize asian women. Then they’ll use the one shitty and shallow woman they’ve encountered as proof that all women are shallow. And dating sites!! I wish they’d get off those god awful dating sites.

That isn’t just a “mistake”, it doesn’t matter if they got caught up in the “moment.” Any person that loves and respects their partner wouldn’t even put themselves in a position where that’s even a possible outcome. And someone who actually loves and respects their BEST FRIEND also wouldn’t even be in that position. Being alone together is not an excuse. They really couldn’t control themselves because they were alone together? *Really?* Nothing is a good excuse for what they did to you!! Neither of them are victims. 

Sometimes second chances are not deserved. They just want to see how much they can get away with, how much you’ll forgive them for. Some things are unforgivable 

I’m sorry you’re going through this, know that it’s not your fault, and has nothing to do with you.

Plateaus suck! They can be frustrating. I’m the type to convince myself it’s okay to eat as well, so I’m a little worried I might eat too much when my fast is over. A hungry brain is an irrational one.

But even if you make it to 24 hours that’s really good! That’s still an entire day’s worth of calories now put to a deficit. Fasting is hard, especially when we have to be home all day, but I’m sure you’ll get out of your plateau soon:)"

I got back on it again but the thing i realized is, losing weight is so much more than not eating. It’s giving up your favorite foods unless you only want to eat tiny portions and go to bed hungry. It’s watching the people around you eat and smelling their food after your eating window is closed. During quarantine, it can be giving up the only thing you’re looking forward to; a nice meal.

I read someone say that you should treat not eating as a task, instead of a lack of one. Fasting is an activity. You’re actively burning fat, keeping track of calories, practicing self control, giving your digestive system a break, and working towards a goal. 

You got this! It gets so much easier after the first day."

Congrats on knowing so much about women though. You truly are the woman expert to know what every single women in the world likes and wants! It’s actually amazing that you know the thoughts and feelings of all 4 billion women on this earth. I should be thanking you for sharing this data with me and the rest of the world. Obviously women only date super attractive men that all look the same, because no ugly, short, disabled, fat, underweight, acne scarred, ect. men have ever been in a relationship and reproduced. 
Also of course there’s no self reflection or responsibility on any male’s part, it’s all women’s fault 100% of the time in every situation. Men don’t have ridiculously low standards because they swipe right on literally anything with a vagina even if they’re repulsed by her! It’s women who have high standards because they won’t fuck any man that throws himself at her. 

Lol. Have a nice day homie. Keep swiping right."
IncelsInAction,fppm339,t1_fpphadm,1588804808.0,"Me bringing up issues women face means incels don’t suffer??? Dude how do you even do that kind of mental gymnastics? You were the one to deny that women had any trouble at all, I never said incels didnt suffer. Can you seriously not grasp the idea of both parties facing challenges? Really? Also you go there as a last resort? That’s kind of setting yourself up for failure considering that dating sites are focused on looks FIRST, and if you don’t want to be judged on your looks it seems a bit counterproductive.

Anyway, I’m sorry that for some reason you think it’s women’s faults that men have low standards. You say women have all these choices to choose from and men don’t. Okay so why do you guys sell yourself to women you’re not even attracted to? You guys will scrape the crumbs off the floor and complain you didn’t get any better. Of course unattractive women have choices when men will take anything they can get apparently. Regardless, I don’t know where incels get the idea that unattractive women can easily get super attractive men. It’s just not realistic. I’ve seen *way* more couples where the woman is attractive and the man is average or below. A lot of women try very hard to be attractive to men and believe it or not, face rejection as well. Not every woman is beautiful and charismatic. There are women who wake up to no messages on their phones and matches from only dudes like you who swipe right on any woman that gets shown to them. 

“Funny they didn’t take into account their personality” for what? A hookup with someone they’ll never see again?? LMAO. 
Most women don’t go on dating sites for relationships because the dudes there are scummy, and that’s why there’s such a shortage of women on these sites. It’s safer for a woman to meet someone organically and not have a bunch of thirsty dudes that may or may not even be attracted to her begging for her to have sex with them. The ones on there are there for hookups. 
I love how it’s women’s faults that they have bad experiences because they “chose” the guy not knowing his personality (which by the way, no one knows until they message them) and he ends up being a jerk. But I bet you wouldn’t think it was fair for other people to say it’s your fault you got matched with a bitchy, obese, single mother of 6 because you swiped on literally every woman in your area without knowing their personality.

Like do you not see the fault in your logic here?

Either way dude, I’m sorry you’re having trouble finding someone online but like I said earlier, dating sites are toxic and a hella superficial way to meet people. It’s shallow from the start since you’re supposed to decide which people are matches based on looks alone before you even talk to them. I’m not denying you have issues finding a partner online but women have trouble too. Even if hookups are a different story, most women don’t find steady relationships online. In this current time, it’s harder to go out and meet people but when the virus blows over I’d honestly suggest looking at events going on in your area and try to find someone organically. But it’s your life, do you."
IncelsWithoutHate,fppc59s,t1_fppbolo,1588799609.0,If you want to believe that half of the entire population hates you based on a couple shitty people that’s your thing. Just know that women may not give you the benefit of the doubt for the same reason. Sorry you keep yourself miserable this way. I hope you wake up soon.
IncelsWithoutHate,fppac1g,t1_fpp8wsz,1588798691.0,"“Girls who look like that.“ very normal, average looking girls with no makeup and normal clothing? Lol. They’re just girls!

Dude girls don’t think much of guys who never interact or talk with them at all. They don’t hate you, they don’t think you’re below them, they just don’t think about you! If you make an effort to talk to them like you would with a male classmate/coworker, you’d probably feel differently. Women don’t want to be praised for every little thing they do and put on an untouchable pedestal, and they don’t want to be resented and belittled for not giving sex and affection to every man that wants it. Why is it so hard for some people to grasp that women just want to be respected and treated like normal humans. Either incels see women as some unattainable treasure or as subhuman “hole” that exists for the enjoyment of men. Women are neither. They are humans. You can’t generalize 4 billion people. Each woman is different, even a group of ladies this small is going to have vast differences in interests, hobbies, beliefs, personalities, ect. Women are not a hive mind.

It’s so weird to me that you guys find yourselves to be subhuman or wastes of space and yet also convince yourselves that women spend their time thinking about you, the quiet dude that sits in the back of the class and says nothing to anyone, and considering him to be less valuable than anyone around him. She just doesn’t know you exist dude. Talk to her like you would like someone to talk to you. See women as people before you see them as potential sexual or romantic pursuits. When you objectify people, you make yourself forget that they are just humans with unique thoughts and not some kind of status symbol you have to be worthy to “win.”"
IncelsInAction,fpp1r9g,t1_fpp0s8q,1588794447.0,"Nobody said women don’t care about looks. They said that looks aren’t the ONLY things that matters or even the most important thing. You brought up tinder, which is 100% based on looks and is a terrible example of women as a whole in the dating world. I said that you should hear how tinder makes women feel and think about men. I’ve personally known other women who’ve used the sites and it’s unanimous that there are tons of scummy and shallow dudes on there. Unanimous. And you say “bullshit”. As if no woman has ever had a bad experience on tinder. 

Obviously women still use it to find hookups because it’s a hookup site, but men do to otherwise these women wouldn’t be so “successful”. Also if you want to bring up people still using it despite their horrible dating experiences please explain why every dating site is populated 3x as much by men. If you guys are just suffering on there maybe you should get off. That’s what women searching for real relationships do instead of sobbing online and hating 4 billion people because of the 15 shitty ones they’ve encountered on a hookup site."
IncelsWithoutHate,fpozpn4,t1_fpoy1mt,1588793436.0,You kids are so delusional lol. Is this really what you guys think girls think about? Chill. You make yourselves miserable by putting words in the mouth’s of those you never listen to.
IncelsInAction,fpoy739,t1_fpoxcbg,1588792697.0,"I love how incels deny that women have any bad experiences at all, not that any of you know anything about women anyway. Also congrats on finding your favorite word."
IncelsInAction,fponnz2,t1_fpnq116,1588787546.0,So then change that??? Start being nice and respectful. Stay loyal to the people around you. Get into hobbies you think are interesting. Why do you act like these are things that are out of your control?

Even the “incels without hate” is full of hatred. I can’t feel bad for people who dehumanize half the population because they think they’re entitled to ownership over them. Sorry you hate yourself bro, maybe change your shitty mindset and become someone you deem worthy of self love. If having bad luck in dating makes you write runes all over yourself every day and destroys your entire outlook on life maybe your issue isn’t women."
