offmychest,f92m27p,t3_e3e00m,1575036435.0,"You can be a “mouth breather” due to many different factors. Random things like stress, anxiety, even allergies. It’s such a silly, stupid insult. Has nothing to do with intelligence or superiority. Don’t let this get to you!"
ABoringDystopia,evgw9g7,t3_cjkpt8,1564516866.0,"This is so painful to read. When it comes to our healthcare system in America, I almost feel like I’m scared to use it, out of fear of these types of bills, trying to take advantage of everyone. I still can’t get all my medical needs due to the fact that we don’t have a natural “right” to healthcare or in my case needed surgery... No one NO ONE, should feel like this. It’s outright disrespectful to all the people that have worked so hard to fight, attribute, and uplift our society. Just to have $10000 in medical bills, even with insurance."
