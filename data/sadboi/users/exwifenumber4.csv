People praise and call attention to themselves when they don’t do something sexual to someone. Because of the low effort to punish those who sexually assault, we have created a society that accepts it as normal because the people doing it in the first place have not been properly brought to justice. People think they’re special or a saint if they didn’t take advantage of another while under the influence. Like, as you should. You aren’t special if you’ve done the right thing, because that’s what everyone should be doing. The right thing is to not sexually assault anyone. Don’t take it personally."
