Horrorart,fo9hdf6,t3_g66fvh,1587619572.0,Extremely unique. Love this uniqueness. You should post more.
mentalillness,fnz1dzh,t1_fnz0m6p,1587383186.0,Like I said. Those are people who give up. Fight for your happiness. You will win if you keep at it. Even if it takes years. Don‚Äôt give up. Happiness isn‚Äôt something that is in a reserve or a specific quantity or like a storage or something. It‚Äôs something you create. I believe in you.
mentalillness,fnz07v4,t1_fnyyu55,1587382097.0,Anybody can punch through a wall just like how anybody can be happy. Those who are never happy are those who never tried or gave up.
mentalillness,fnyyphv,t1_fnvrpcr,1587380593.0,Success comes to those who put forth effort and prevail throughout pressure and failure. It‚Äôs literally RNG. If you keep punching a wall how long do you think it‚Äôll take until you punch through it? You won‚Äôt punch through it at all if you just stop punching it because of the pain.
mentalillness,fnvboun,t3_g40n1m,1587287252.0,"Think about how great you feel when you don‚Äôt give up and you do get what you want. Just like how failure is inevitable, so is success if you keep at it."
