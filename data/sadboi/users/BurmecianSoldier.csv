These two are much simpler outfits. 

I don't think there's necessarily an easier way to make the costume. That particular costume just happens to be a hefty task. If you can find similar things to alter that would probably be easier than making the whole thing from scratch. Like if you can find a black bikini with a similar style top you can just paint the triangles on yourself. If you can find similar bracelets to what she has you can just paint them gold. If you can find sandals in that style you can paint them white and make the little things to attach to them. You can make her necklace & accessories from cardboard/foam/worbla if you can't find anything to alter.
