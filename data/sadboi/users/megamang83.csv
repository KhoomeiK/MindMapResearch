It happened for about a year where I would work hard to pay bills and all but then drop off after it all was paid. My wife let it happen and to be honest that grew the pattern till she almost had enough and opened up about it. It did hurt and it put me in a sad state but for the right reasons though. I felt sad not because of depression but I hurt her. Honesty is key to a healthy marriage so please be honest with each other. Reading this was like having that chat again with my wife. I honestly feel for you right because the responsibility that your carrying now is huge and probably makes you feel guilty, sad and angry but please talk to him about it or better still send him the post you have put up. Depression is a shitty thing to have but what snapped me out was that I've always said 'I never wish this upon anyone' and yet pushed my wife into it and hurt her. Hope this helps, I really do hope it works out,  but there is a line where it's mental health and been selfish or taking the piss(sorry to say)."
