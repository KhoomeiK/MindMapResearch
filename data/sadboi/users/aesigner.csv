3Dprintmything,fmdm8pj,t1_fmd3bq1,1585971482.0,"I wish I could laser cut the sheets but unfortunately, Sorbothane can't be laser cut. Thanks for the suggestion though!"
3Dprintmything,fmd0dt0,t1_fmczof1,1585956573.0,"I did upload and get a quote for CNC machining the part on 3DHubs for approximately $200. I just submitted a request for a quote from Protolabs.

Thank you for your advice and feedback. Having this die printed in tough resin was going to be my last attempt before resorting back to steel rule dies/CNC machined parts."
3Dprintmything,fmczbwj,t1_fmcy3rf,1585955935.0,"I don't believe Protolabs offers the service of making custom steel dies. I have contacted a few custom steel rule die companies and was told that the geometry was too thin/small to accomodate with their dies. I have by no means contacted many custom steel die companies so I may explore that route further although cost is a primary concern. If cost were no objection, I'd likely opt to have the sheets waterjet cut but the quotes I received ranged from $200-$650 for a single sheet. 

I completely agree that no plastic or resin has the same properties, i.e. sharpness or hardness, as a metal steel blade. I believe my prior mistake with the test SLA die was to press it against a relatively hard surface, a cutting mat. I'm hoping by pressing it on a softer surface and material like cardboard, I'll avoid breaking the die when trying to cut through sorbothane. 

Thank you for the advice/wisdom, I have cut sorbothane sheets before with an exacto knife and completely agree. I found that swapping for a fresh blade frequently made for much cleaner and easier cuts. Unfortuantely this geometry is more detailed that I can comfortably cut by hand. I'm also hoping that placing the sorbothane sheets in the fridge for ~15-20 minutes to freeze the material and make it less gummy and more stiff will help make for cleaner and easier cuts."
3Dprintmything,fmcxpr9,t1_fmcwt83,1585954960.0,"Sure. It's my attempt/trial at a 3D printed die for cutting rubber, specifically sorbothane as a dampening sheet to go inside a keyboard. I've printed it on my FDM machine but the extrusion width of 0.4mm is a bit too thick to cut well. I've tried a smaller prototype with Formlabs standard resin and it was able to cut through in parts but broke under the stress/clamping force. I'm hoping tough resin will be able to withstand the force needed to press down and cut the rubber. I've explored other options such as waterjet cutting, ordering a custom steel die but have decided to give this a go due to cost constraints. Hope that answers your question and feel free to ask for any additional info!"

From my experience, the BKE lights were incredibly tactile so if you like the stock 55g domes and want a bit more tactility, I'd recommend getting the ultra light domes and perhaps getting a sample pack to try first. I tried lubing the sliders for the stabilizers and had them become mushy/sticky so I just lubed the stabilizer wire. Granted I used krytox 205g0 so that might have been too thick given how tight the stabilizer sliders fit in the housing. Downsides with at least the BKE lights are a pretty substantial increase in sound so you might want to get silexning rings if you get the BKE domes."

For me personally, evaluating the choice of materials, specs, advertising/marketing, etc. surrounding the car, it's clear that this car is meant to be used and not necessarily meant to be admired by people who would never buy/use a pickup truck. I like that it looks so unique and different from any other cars even if I do prefer the traditional/existing aesthetic design of the rest of Tesla's vehicle line-up. Some concerns/thoughts I have are safety of passengers in the event of an accident. Older car models in the 1950s were made of stiff metals and this caused the impact of any accidents and crashes to be absorbed by passengers in the vehicle. A lot of vehicles nkw are intentionally designed with a crumple zone to absorb this impact force. I'd be interested to hear or learn what techniques, if any, were used to mitigate or counter this. Only time will tell what the sales/demand for the car will be like and how usable/well-designed it is when it's actually driven by users."

MechanicalKeyboards,f77o7cy,t3_duovhj,1573467335.0,"From my experience and in my opinion, the Tofu has a lot of empty space which is conducive to pinging. If you're really not sure, you can always build the keyboard and test to see if you're happy with the sound without any dampening material. If you're not, I can say that MKUltra foam is a great option for reducing that pinging. I personally cut sorbothane sheets to place between the case and PCB, and PCB and plate and that seemed to work pretty well. 

To reply to the previous comment regarding MKUltra not replying, I've had the pleasure of meeting the owner in person at the Bay Area keyboard meetup and I can say he's a really good guy. He felt guilty about building keyboards to bring to the meetup since he wasnt fulfilling customer orders. He gets tons of messages and it's difficult to run a business by yourself from maintaining a website, making/assembling products, marketing yourself, working on new products, fulfilling orders, etc. I think it's easy to not see not a human on the other side of the screen but I can promise he's doing the best he can and I personally find his goal of making custom mechanical keyboards accessible to everyone through lower pricing and keeping his products in stock vs. group buys is highly commendable."
