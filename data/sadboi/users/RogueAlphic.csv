homeless,f3ngrxs,t1_f3m9lav,1570997981.0,"Wish I could even eat the left overs but they have cleaning staff that quickly discard and clean the food plates. 

I wish I could go south but I'm Canadian so I'm stuck dealing with this winter. Thanks for the suggestions though."
homeless,f3lg7a5,t1_f3idll6,1570975586.0,"Your absolutely right and like I said, I would have to be blood driven like my friend was. Like he was everything you described, frustrated and angry about his situation that he was using it to fuel him forward. I knew all along that's what it would take for me to obtain success, but I also know myself and I'm definitely not going to be able to do that. I'm finding it extremely difficult to want to stay alive everyday. I've had my life completely sucked and beat out of me. I can't even find gigs on Craigslist that would be suitable for me like general Labour. I don't have the physical strength to do even that so that basically cuts me out of the job market pool.   

And then there's the sleeping rough everyday. Even now I'm 36 hrs since my last sleep due to it getting down to 0 Celsius the past few days so this is just a sign of what's to come. These all sound like excuses but they're what I have to live with everyday. 

I just reread my response earlier and it brought tears to my eyes. I'm such a coward and wimp. I used to be so much better than I am now. A shell of my former self, a part I will NEVER get back. Just wish someone would put me out off my misery."
homeless,f3l8r50,t1_f3iq8up,1570973594.0,"Thank you from the bottom of my heart, truly thank you. I have tears in my eyes because I've finally found someone who gets me! I've been a people pleaser my entire life and tried to pursue corporate jobs and the like and they never worked for me. There was something that my soul rejected about the whole thing and was at that point only doing it for others and not myself. 

Eventually I stopped working for years due to the worsening of my depression, and we all know how bad that gets when your not working. I had no self worth because society judges your value based on how much money you make and I was making $0 for a very long time. I was also rejected by my parents which was the nail in the coffin. I've looked into other ways of making money but they all require you to have finances for you to invest into as well as a lot of time and errors. Entrepreneurship basically is my only path but because of my mental illnesses, no finances and current homeless situation it's nothing but a goal, a far off goal if that.

I'm truly glad you responded to this post and it makes me much more happy about my decision to post this. No judgement or criticism, just basically talking about your own life experiences and the struggles. Thank you for sharing your story, I really needed to see something like this, like you don't even know."
homeless,f3kyfgn,t1_f3ih3n2,1570970879.0,My heart goes out to you and your ex. Worse part is addictions get much worse once you are displaced. Hopefully she can find some kinda help because I know all too well that depression causes you to self medicate through each owns vices.
homeless,f3i7qn5,t1_f3htkcl,1570933262.0,"First off thank you for reading through my long post and responding with such an in-depth story of your life and time being homeless. I'm happy to hear that you preserved through and managed to break free of this cursed life, but I'm going to be honest with you, success stories like yours depresses me more. I know what I've tried and I've never been strong on my own. There are a innumerable amount of issues I'm trivialed with like not having shelter in below freezing temperatures and lack of sleep, eating, energy, feeling like complete shit everyday, etc. Like you said the path will be hard and I have no will to even attempt it any longer. I've lost the mental and physical battle out here and about to lose my welfare, my only financial assistance out here. Once that's gone I'm through. 

I'm sorry I know you are trying to help me, build me up to be better but I can't even fake trying to be motivated anymore. I just have no irl support anymore and being alone all the time, I've pretty much self destructed. Especially knowing I'm now going to be spending my winter homeless, I just want to die. I feel terrible that I have to speak this way to the one person who decided to respond to my post. Honestly I think I would have ended myself tonight had you not so you have bought me some time. I just can't hide my pain any longer. The places I had depended on getting me through the nights are now gone. I don't think I can do another night of this endless nightmare. I cannot think about the future anymore, only today, and I feel like I don't want to see tomorrow morning. Thank you for offering your advice and motivation though, I do really appreciate you doing this for me."
depression,f3h9rms,t3_dh11ag,1570920804.0,"I hear you man I'm 10 years older than you and have never had a irl girlfriend. I was rejected by every girl I've ever liked growing up and honestly don't even count the long distance relationship. It's all about the face in this world and you either have it or you don't. I'm sorry you are going through this situation, it's a tough and unfair world to be guy. Hopefully the surgery does something for you my man"

Been struggling ever since. The issue I had was I was on welfare and still paying her rent ( from the $330 monthly income) barely had enough for food and she thought I was living comfortable, like what? If there's one thing I learned since going through this is you can't rely on anyone anymore in this world. If you do at some point you'll eventually get burned bad, like 1st degree type burns."
homeless,f26t5df,t3_dc3moc,1570022670.0,"Dude I totally hear you on the giving up part, it's what's allowed me to keep going at this point. You gotta use what you can to get through the days and my lack of care for anything has kept me from offing myself. Use your frustration and hate for everything to keep you going, at least for now. I've been enduring this shit for 5 freaking months now and everyday I wonder how I made it this far, especially without some key items that would make it a helluva lot easier like a car and a job. That puts me in the highest tier of survival imo and if your in the same situation without those key necessities your top tier too. I know it doesn't feel like much of anything right now but trust me, there are people that would 100% off themselves right now if they were about to be homeless. Your a cut above the rest just by simply being alive and enduring through this torment.

I know it seems hopeless because let's be honest, it really is being in that situation. But I want to believe that everyone has a chance of getting out of this, we just have to be patient and wait for our turn. It will hopefully work itself out eventually. But yea man, I feel you completely on the giving up part. Hopefully we can by some miracle find a place before winter hits."

depression,f0kzkjy,t3_d5bewe,1568692793.0,"Very good post and I can relate entirely. May I ask are you still homeless? I am currently for 5 months now and have had the same experiences as you. Everyday something new would happen, so much so that I had to log them. I've got hundreds of stories I can tell now and those experiences I would've never witnessed had I still been living being an introvert shut in before. It's changed me, for better and for worse. My depression worsened but I've also meet so many people in the real world and now on reddit of all places. Souls really will find each other's no matter the distance we are connected on a deeper level.

It's hard sometimes, well most times to see the beauty of the world around you while living homeless because of the discomfort of being exposed 24/7. I struggle with this battle everyday and most days it's black and white but at some point I'm forced into seeing the greatness by what seems to be random occurances, but are they? Like you I meditate and think a lot and has matured my awareness of the everyday changing world around me, something that most people may never acquire in 2019. Anyways great read, I'm surprised you didn't post this in the r/homeless sub. I'm pretty active over there posting about my miserable day lol. I hope you got out of being homeless as it's a very humbling and enlightening experience but still, no one should have to do it for too long."

relationship_advice,f09cygs,t3_d4bfev,1568498476.0,"I had relationships like this before where I was unemployed but friends were outgoing and wanted me to tag along with them to events. Money was always an issue as I've always been in low end jobs to unemployed for most of my life. Needless to say, I had to part ways because it was MONEY holding the friendship together, I just didn't realize it until further down the road. Why are you and your friends burdening the guy that's already tight on money? And to keep count of how much he owes you all is messed up imo. And then to convince him to buy a ticket for an expensive vacation is baffling to me. Be honest and say you did that out of selfishness for yourselves, not because you just wanted him there. If you really wanted him to come, y'all should've pooled together money to AT LEAST cover his plane ticket. 

Imma be blunt and say you aren't his friend at all. Y'all are using him for your own convenience and when the debt gets high enough, you will discard him and move on anyway. Please do him a favor and cut ties with him now before next month. He deserves better friends than y'all."

At this point in my life I've just come to the realization that I'll probably never have a relationship or will experience sex. I drew the short straw so I don't even bother trying.

For the first time since I've been homeless (about 4 months and change) I decided to go to a shelter because that cold nights have been killing me lately, dropping down to single digits every night. Of course the shelter is full and there is no vacancies available anytime soon. I was sent on my way with a couple slices of dry bread. Hadn't eaten anything for days before then either. 

So yea basically I'm on my own. Lost the will to live completely. Only reason I'm still alive is because I'm a coward. Dunno how much longer I can endure this. I'm thinking maybe I'll just continue to sleep outside in the hopes of dying in my sleep from exposure."

I feel utterly worthless and each day is a struggle not to off myself. Even now as I write this I feel like leaving notes for people so I can just get it over with. People think it's easy to remain positive and hopeful that someday things will get better, but the question is....when? A month to a year from now? Or tomorrow? You just give up the fight to live at that point because your fight to stay alive is 100x harder than everyday regular people and the pain oh my goodness the pain. If only there was a way to visually see someone's trauma they are enduring, for I'm sure it would be obvious then to see who has lost the will. 

Anyways I don't want to detract away from this posts dedication to Aaron. I just saw this and I saw myself in Aarons place, possibly even a foreshadowing of my own death soon. RIP Aaron I totally get it and wholeheartedly completely understand, the pain was just too great."
SuicideWatch,ezuj1t4,t3_d2f1mu,1568153313.0,"I almost wept reading this, because I've been wanting that exact thing to happen to me. The pain of living while being homeless, unemployed, broke, hungry and totally isolated has broken me. I now seek death on a daily basis in anyway, shape or form."
depression,eztrzz7,t3_d2azwj,1568137325.0,Apply for Ontario works. It offers free eye exams and $100 towards a new pair of glasses. The glasses will be cheap and ugly as fuck but it will hold you until you can get something you actually want. Also Wal-Mart offers eye exams and glasses for $150 as well I believe.
homeless,ezmk8im,t3_d1jm93,1567993237.0,Wish I could do this but its far to cold to even be sleeping outside now. At least for me it is
SuicideWatch,ezmis3p,t3_d1jmql,1567992565.0,"My life has steadily gotten worse since I was born. No education or job title and homeless without anything to show for my 31 yrs of existence and I'm supposed to believe that life will improve? Well I don't believe in blind optimism. If someone is experiencing hell, they're to keep experiencing hell FOR the slight CHANCE that it will get better? Well not me not anymore"
SuicideWatch,ezmgeno,t3_d1jq42,1567991542.0,"Me too but add in bi polar and being homeless I'm surprised I'm still alive, but not for much longer...."
SuicideWatch,ezmg0ga,t3_d1jqso,1567991385.0,In the exact same situation dude. It's dropping down to single digits tonight. Thinking of stripping down and going to sleep outside and not waking back up.
SuicideWatch,ezmds5s,t1_ezmbhr0,1567990506.0,Not when you have to sleep in the snow your walking in
SuicideWatch,ezmdcya,t3_d1j1zc,1567990336.0,"Same I plan to ""check out"" before winter too. It's already like winter temperatures here so hoping I can die from hypothermia or something. Not gonna deal with being homeless for much longer"
dating_advice,ezmam7v,t3_d1d583,1567989251.0,"Well I'm 31 yrs old, totally unemployed and homeless and never had experienced sex, intimacy, kissing or holding a girls hand. Never really had females as friends. You have wayyyyy better odds then I'll ever have. I'm pretty much damaged and undateable. Your 24, you still have plenty of time."
relationship_advice,ezm8j65,t1_ezm4zvn,1567988298.0,Best advice right here. I 100% second this
homeless,ezm7ly8,t1_ezm5ij9,1567987804.0,"That will never happen as long as people value currency over life. Just look at life insurance, putting a $ to people's lives. Your worth more dead than alive. Barely anyone values anyone's life apart from themselves and anyone directly related to them. It's all about what you can do for them at the end of the day, which has destroyed us as a race of humans,"
depression,ezm725l,t1_ezm52z3,1567987495.0,"That's quite alright, your better off holding what little left you have in the tank, you'll need it. Society is doing exactly what it's supposed to do, consume the poor and protect the rich. I've given up on jobs, searching for over a decade with no luck will do that to you lol. I sleep currently in a garbage dump underground and sometimes in portapottys when I'm unable to go there."
depression,ezm6dl1,t3_d1iw24,1567987128.0,"You have very good insight. Very observant of the world around you. I've said it many times, ""the internet has been a blessing and a curse to humanity"". It's connected us globally but disconnected us from each other physically. Ever notice how some people prefer to talk in text messages over being in actual person? Or the phone even? Ours minds have transitioned into being more comfortable in the cyber world then the physical. Because in the cyber world most of our problems don't exist there. It's also really easy to be whatever you want because of the anonymous identity the internet provides. 

Basically what I'm trying to say is people prefer the artificial world over the real one. This hasn't happened ""by accident"" either. This was planned in advance a long time ago."
depression,ezm451h,t1_ezm21sc,1567986122.0,"Uh yeah I'm homeless lol. It's passable if I ever get a roof and a decent job but who offers those to homeless people? But more importantly, finding the will to live above all else."
homeless,ezm3q71,t1_ezm1qdk,1567985926.0,"Yea I used to have dreams of moving to Japan myself too. It was a dream of mine for half my life but all of my dreams and goals have drifted away and reality is all that I see now. There is no light at the end of the tunnel, I will be in poverty for the rest of  y life. I lost all motivation and like you frequently dissociate. If I didn't do that I would've offed myself already. I still get the feeling to do so everyday. This struggle is trying not to do so"
depression,ezm1w86,t3_d1ig7w,1567985098.0,Same for me but I'm homeless so I'm forced into seeing it everyday. imagine how I feel. I feel like killing myself today lol
homeless,ezm07m7,t3_d1hzpv,1567984313.0,I'm in the same boat. I live in Canada and Toronto is one if not most expensive cities to live in over here. Most people need roommates to split on the rent because the prices for apartments are sky high. It's only getting worse now as most landlords only rent to students for a easy flip. I see the homeless population getting worse every month and yet politicians won't even talk about it. This city is about to be the death of me
SuicideWatch,ezly86t,t3_d1gnwz,1567983405.0,No your not. Your a failure when your someone that's 31 yrs old with no education or real job experience and is current living on the streets waiting for a slow death. I'd happily give up my life to reincarnate and do what you did all over again.
SuicideWatch,ezlxk3h,t3_d1grac,1567983100.0,"I'm in the exact same situation but also homeless. My life has gotten significantly worse that last few years. Haven't experienced any firsts, never had a gf or a career job or a car or anything. Just a complete failure and I'm definitely where I belong."
SuicideWatch,ezlwijg,t1_ezlvojf,1567982646.0,Thank you and same to you. I hope all the best for whatever that may be for you
