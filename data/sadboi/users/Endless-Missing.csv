conspiracy,fo798f5,t1_fo75bkq,1587574418.0,"That makes a lot of sense, it does make me feel very thankful for everything I currently have. I could have been in a lot worse of a situation when this whole thing hit so I feel lucky. 

Thank you, I hope everyone can find themselves in better situations soon!


That's true, people have a lot more time to plan things out for the future, this would be a great time for it. And you're right, good can come from anywhere."
conspiracy,fo74kwa,t3_g5zhe3,1587572139.0,"I also noticed people are spending more time outside and doing other things lately. I live by a bike path and my partner and I see all the people coming and going. Lately a lot more families have been out riding bikes or just hanging out. I went on a hike and some dude was chilling in the forest in a hammock on his phone and tons of people were just out hiking at 6pm. I've even felt a lot calmer lately in my own personal life because nothing is happening for once. I can just take a second to breathe. However, there are pros and cons. Cons being a lot more domestic violence and deaths have been occurring. People are stuck with their abusers, that's something I can't ever stop thinking about. Or all the homeless who relied on a lot of the resources around town that are closing. All the extreme changes are interesting to see."
BPD,fnupun2,t3_g3zxuq,1587268014.0,Definitely understand this. It's what they say and do and how they care or don't.
BPD,fnt43bv,t3_fz9cyl,1587234230.0,Whatever happened to the bpd chatroom for this sub reddit? It seemed like a really nice place
conspiracy,fnnn3cc,t1_fneemh4,1587096324.0,Do you know where I can learn about that? I typed Dues Lutos into google and didn't get anything relevant and I'd be really curious to learn about what all this is and means.
conspiracy,fnml5ib,t1_fnkc74g,1587073412.0,"I was thinking about this because when I see people on  this sub reddit talk about witchcraft, magick, occult ect. I always notice they instantly place it in the devil worship category. But I know that a lot of people who practice those kinds of things aren't all devil worshipers. Some worship the earth, deitys, the universe or nothing at all and its very generalizing to look at anyone with a tarot deck and think that means their cannibal demon worshipers. 

And I don't think using the bible really holds up as a great argument for all magic being evil to those of us who aren't religious."
conspiracy,fmtuuqe,t3_fx08vg,1586379406.0,"I've heard about that phenomenon a long time ago actually, it's weird I'd document it, if it happens again maybe get a video"
conspiracy_commons,ffdggxl,t1_ffdejtr,1579820359.0,"Wow, I had no idea there was so many different secs. Also in the video she actually talks about the uncle sam factory. I think she may even be showing a video by the girl you mentioned. I'll definitely look into it more, I think there is validity in it. Tell me about some more stuff later! Hope you have a good day"
conspiracy_commons,ffdbk9d,t1_ffd88et,1579817360.0,"I've looked into MK Ultra a little bit in the past, it's pretty messed up. I find it all pretty interesting. And yeah I can confirm the trauma thing myself as well, I went through a lot of abuse in my childhood and I have a lot of repressed memories from it, it's the brains way of protecting you when it thinks you'd be unable to handle processing  certain situations yet. 

I guess I can see how those things link up, I can't for certain say that they stopped projects like MK ultra but I'm weary when it brought up because I feel like a lot of people use it to explain away a lot of things. For example, gang stalking. I don't buy it, I think it's a community of people who may be suffering from severe mental illness and their excuse for believing they are being followed is MK ultra though a lot of the things they explain sound more like paranoid schizophrenia. So I try and be careful when people use it in conspiracy theories. 

Media would be the best way, I buy that. 

I'll make sure to look into that documentary!

My bad, I misinterperted. I'm agnostic though and so I have a hard time connecting to things relating to God. And do you mean like devil worship or satanism? Because they are different. I had a satanist friend, they don't actually worship satan."

conspiracy_commons,ffd7x2k,t1_ffd3srw,1579815154.0,"Also, I just want to point out that I've know very effeminate straight men. Men who've had roughly the body shape of women and that have acted in ways some people would see a feminine. Straight man behavior is hard to really pin down especially with how people express themselves these days despite whatever sexuality they are. I was a massive tom boy growing up and I look like a boy to some people but I'm a girl. You guys say stereotypical straight man behavior  but not every straight guys acts like a stereotypical straight man."

conspiracy_commons,ffd6uut,t1_ffd6cu5,1579814569.0,"Could you link me to some explanations about the whole satanic thing? I haven't seen that either. I still reccomend considering some of the points in the video. He made a weird tweet asking the president to let his friend out. And on abuse, not everyone who was abused becomes abusers though it can happen. I'll consider the points you made though. But please watch the rest of the video, I think it's pretty good."
conspiracy_commons,ffd64b9,t1_ffd3srw,1579814155.0,"The theory  in the video is actually that he's trying to warn people about pizzagate and that he was previously a victim of it having been in the industry since childhood or people hes know were. If you get a chance to see the whole video she makes some really good points on all of this. His persistence to get people to listen to the song and watch the video which leaves a lot of not to subtle clues seems strange. If he was a part of pizzagate I don't think he'd be making everything this obvious. 

Justin being female is one I haven't heard before. I'd have to look into it to really comment on it."
BPD,feujjgx,t3_eqjfid,1579387134.0,"I have extreme empathy, I feel other peoples emotions strongly. If someone is sad, I'll feel sad, if someone is happy I'll feel happy. When I'm on my own I can go through tons of emotions in a short period of time. 

I think it depends on who you ask. Not everyone with bpd is the same so while I or someone else with bpd can be high in empathy some people may feel the opposite."

BPD,fejz648,t3_epikyu,1579189158.0,"Yeah, I feel this way a lot. Sometimes I feel like I'm back in the emotional state of my 13 year old self. I hardly feel like an adult most days. My mom left my life early and became a meth addict who was in and out of prison most of my life. My dad was super physically abusive and I most likely was born with bpd from him. He doesn't believe in mental health though so he'll probably never go get checked for it. I stopped talking to him anyways though so I guess it doesn't really matter. He dragged me through homelessness. Bounced around from family member to family member constantly being tossed to the side over and over again. My grandma at 10 told me to start being more mature then my parents. That I have to be better then them even then as a 10 year old. It sucks, I feel like my childhood was stolen from me sometimes."
BPD,feiqa9d,t3_epcdpx,1579144531.0,"Absolutely. I did the same thing with researching her, I felt such a connection to her and it made me super sad hearing how she died seemingly so alone. I feel like not a lot of people really learn about how her life actually was and just say she was some hot iconic sex symbol. She really was so much more and I don't think a lot of people saw past her persona. She really was lonely. I wish I could have been friends with her and helped her through all of that."

The day after I got it in I went to go jump off a bridge because I was feeling such intense emotional agony. The change it caused in me also caused me and my partner to breakup, everything was just hell. It made every bpd symptom of mine amplified to the extreme. I feel like I have some amount of trauma from the whole thing because I still have nightmares about that part of my life and just remembering is enough to make me cry."

I suppressed it like hell, this is actually the first time I'm even writing it out or mentioning that this was an issue for me. It stopped as soon as contact was cut. That doesn't really work for everyone but that's what worked for me. Just stopped talking to them. I just had to keep rationalizing. ""I'm in a stable relationship with someone I love very much, this weird temporary obsessive crush will not destroy what we have built together."" Because truth be told there is no garuntee that person is at all stable to be with and if it ends up not working out I didn't want to feel like shit for throwing away an amazing relationship for an impulsive unhealthy decision.

For me it started on tinder, after a breakup I hated being alone with no friends so I just said ""fuck it"" and started meeting people off of tinder, romantic pr just as friends.

I'm only speculating but maybe it could be like the development of full on psychosis? Again I'm not a profesional so I'd talk to your psychologist about it before buying into any ideas."
BPD,fed94a7,t1_fed8x36,1579004280.0,"Oh, that's interesting, yeah not sure what that means either. Well then if your just curious about what bpd is like I'd start by looking up the 9 symptoms that qualify people for having it and go from there. There are some good videos by medcircle on it as well."
BPD,fed8tdt,t1_fed8joh,1579003957.0,What do you mean by symptom in relation to borderline? Bpd is made up of multiple symptoms. Did your psychologist talk to you about it when they gave it to you?
BPD,fed8c5c,t3_eojm74,1579003461.0,"I have BPD as well as PTSD, I've heard that BPD can come with PTSD with a lot of diagnosis. I'd say do a lot of research, its helped me a lot. Also try the bpd chatroom here, I think it's also a pretty helpful place. But I totally get what you mean by you understand why you were so weird as a kid. That clicked for me too when I got diagnosed."
BPD,fed85ir,t3_eojxxw,1579003251.0,"Yes and no. Not in the same way as you described, I'd be way to guilt ridden to even do anything small and I usually give strangers and aquantinces the benifit of the doubt but if I know someone really well and I know their patterns and they change in a way towards me that I think might be negative towards me, that's when I feel that way. Wanting people to feel bad, even if it's all imagined negativity from them. But I can feel really really vile sometimes. I've talked to some people about some of the fucked up thoughts when they've happened because they are so intense and so awful that I can even make myself sick from them. When I'm manic and angry and feel that kind of evil feeling I feel like I'm someone else entirely. A different worse scary version of myself. It doesn't happen that often though."

If this is how he resolved this situation with me it's probably not the first time so I shouldn't look at it so personally maybe. I do hope I find friends who are good at communicating things with me, I feel like I always attract the opposite. I'll work on forgiving myself and moving on. Thank you for all of the support!"
BPD,fe7fzuh,t3_eo1hk7,1578914159.0,"Where to even start. Mom had schizophrenia and was a drug addict. I lived with her for the first tiny portion of my life but after losing my half sister to my sisters dad she couldn't be stable. Guess she just broke. Got sent to live with my abusive dad in California, we instantly became homeless. He always confused me. Sometimes he'd seem like he'd genuinely care but the next moment he'd do the worst things to me. It really messed up my sense of love. He'd beat me whenever he'd get drunk which was almost nightly. I'd hear him crying at night sometimes. I think he knew this was all messed up. Last I heard from him he told me to kill myself and that I'm a bum because I couch surfed in order to survive. (I'm fine now, living with my partner) 

Ended up getting sent to my grandfather and step grandmother. He has massive paranoia issues that rubbed off on me. I'm pretty sure I developed my anxiety and disassociation there. He was violent in a different way from my dad. He'd scream at me and make me stand in corners for hours on end. I was bad at math and he told me ""I'm going to stand here and yell at you like a drill Sargent until you memorize this"" he would deprive me of sleep just to talk down to me for being bad at it. Tell me that I didn't love the family when I couldn't do something. 

They eventually put me in foster care. Which also was a mixed bag, it had its fun times but the family I ended up with was also fairly toxic to eachother. The siblings would take turns ganging up on eachother, usually the younger of us. I was one of them. Even the foster mom and other adults would join in and mock you when you cried about something. Feelings were never valid there. I got called a walking bag of depression, got told no one ever wanted to take me anywhere because I was too depressed. 

Ran away to live in another state and take my chances with my grandma but she was always kind of a ticking time bomb. she's a full on narcissist and master manipulator. Everyone who's been in the family for a while has seen her take her rage out on me. I always suspected I was her target because I could always see through her manipulation and would call her out on it. I got suicidal, she refused me seeing a therapist and told me to just get over it and that whatever problems I am having can be talked out with her. Eventually I couldn't take it and the school admitted me to the hospital on a particularly bad day. She came in whaling with other family members. But as soon as she was alone with me the tears were gone. She told me I had chores to do at home. Not asking if I was okay or anything. She told me I was just acting to make her look bad. 

My aunt has anger issues to the extreme, never hit her kid or anything but shes definitely verbally abusive, tries to find fault in everything anyone says ever. She's basically the definition of the ""let me talk to your manger for non issues because I hate everyone"" type of person. My other aunt is schizophrenic and never gets help, she's spiraling out somewhere. My uncle is actually all around fine if he didn't have such a massive mother complex. Also found out he was treating my cousin like shit and would get me presents for christmas and not her. 

So all around my family is pretty trashed. Don't know my dads side much, they live in another country. I left out some bad details and didn't talk about some other family members that have done other things to me but these are the most reoccurring family members."
BPD,fe5wsbm,t3_env7cg,1578876688.0,"I have too. I've cried multiple times because I know there is nothing I can do to fix everything. All the Epstien stuff and how everyone of those people are getting away with hurting children the way they do. All the hate and misinformation governing peoples thoughts and decisions. I'm truly looking around and seeing how much bad people get away with all the time. And its sucks, I wish I could fix it all. It has been making me extraordinary depressed and and more distrustful of people."
BPD,fakwym8,t1_faammtp,1576174529.0,That could work too! If everyone started using that instead of FP I'd be fine with that. It's a matter of using it and people recognizing it so I don't have to explain what it means each time.
schizophrenia,fafqj5u,t3_e8yh2w,1576029367.0,"I do. My mom was recently diagnosed with Schizophrenia. I think she may have had it for a long time though. She use to say really weird things or say she saw things that weren't there. Not sure why I never considered schizophrenia before. Once when I was a kid she ate dog pop and kept repeating that this was all a dream and it wasn't really happening as my grandmother pulled me away from her sobbing. I have no idea why it never occurred to me not once. Then I ended up with BPD, lord knows if it came from her or my dad."
BPD,faactng,t3_e7zw34,1575907075.0,I always used the term FP because I thought it was just an easier way of saying a co-dependant relationship or having a negative attachment style. I never thought it was a good thing but I did think it was normal as in most people with bpd generally have these bad attachment styles since that's a part of bpd with a lot of people. I absolutley get not romanticizing the idea of FP's I always saw it as something that I needed to grow out of feeling like I need.
BPD,f9on9tz,t3_e60s52,1575508768.0,"Yeah, I'm 20 but I don't feel like I should be, I always thought it was weird and just a personal problem but I never considered it could be tied to my bpd or PTSD."
