However, because it *is* a money making machine and how many people have smartphones these days, ontop of how relatively easy they are to develop and market, it’s become not much more than a cesspool with only an occasional gem throughout.

At some point during post production, though, they changed their minds. It was far too late to reshoot the whole thing. So they just tried their best to make as many edits with minimal reshooting as they could to get a PG rating. This is why the final cut is so blatantly riddled with adult themes and innuendos. 

And I must say: It worked. I was pretty young at the time and I enjoyed it and 99% of the jokes flew over my head. They even made a sequel and marketed it pretty heavily from what I remember.

Your laptop is likely the one that is struggling. While the Vega 56 is starting to show it’s age somewhat, what you are describing sounds like textbook thermal throttling.

It also would help if we knew what games you’re playing. 200fps is seriously high framerates even for ultra high end gaming PC’s. You must be running older games for that to be possible. 

This would also further leave evidence to throttling, as if you’re achieving those kinds of benchmarks in games, it likely wouldn’t be much work for your system (or any respectable system for that matter) to begin with.

I would have spent an absolute fortune on CD’s, records and digital downloads within the 4 years i have used Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal.


Not to mention streaming allows me to find *significantly* more music than I ever would otherwise. My favorite part of all of it is finding an artist who has less than 10k followers and supporting them on social media, buying merch, etc.

In fact I went to a concert of a band i found via streaming, met and hugged all of them and got all of their signatures on a vinyl i bought directly from the lead singer himself in person. using just iTunes, HD Tracks or even YouTube just doesn’t allow stuff like that to happen.

CallOfDuty,fosyjl0,t1_fosm35b,1588040748.0,"Probably your internet. I have no issues finding lobbies on XBL, but on PC it’s unfortunately non-existent, which sucks. It’s normally the other way around but CoD on PC just isn’t very popular :/

Edit: may also depend on the time of day and day of the week. If it’s super late and/or during a weekday, it’s much harder."

eGPU,fojisaj,t3_g7t1vc,1587822034.0,"Error 12 is a PITA for AMD cards. Here’s how I fixed it:

Disable the PCI lane that connects your internal dGPU. Windows defaults to it, and if you disable it , it will use basic windows drivers for your display, whatever that may be.

Then go through your steps as usual. DDU, bootcamp drivers etc.

I don’t remember exactly which PCI lane my 2018 MacBook uses, and especially since yours is 2017, i won’t say for sure but you can find it in your device manager or boot into macOS and find it in your system information app.

I hope this works for you.

Korn,fojbffu,t1_foj68ra,1587815663.0,"I think the issue is that it wasn’t really a Korn album. It was a passion project Jon literally had to convince Fieldy and Munk to participate in. I think had it been a side project and maybe had some other metal band members participated, it may have been more well received. 

Jon himself ofc has disputed this very claim and while I can see where he’s coming from, he has indeed gone off an done more experimental projects afterwards. I think even he realized it and AFIK, they rarely if ever play songs off that record live because so much of it is studio electronic dependent. Just look at how many different dubstep artists were featured. Playing most (if not all) of that record live would require 90% sampling and backtracking. No room for fun, improvising and such on a stage.

A dream of mine is if Jon could have got together some members of other heavy bands (imagine Mick Thompson, Trent Reznor or a member of Cannibal Corpse pitched in!) and then produced something really wild.

Edit: For what it’s worth, I enjoyed it at the time if release, it’s solid for the right type of fan. It just doesn’t set well with Korn fans because...well, it’s a Korn album. Not everyone who listens to Korn enjoys that type of music."
Korn,foikp13,t3_g7l3r8,1587789091.0,Love seeing Untitled so high on the list. It’s such an underrated album. Too often korn fans get wrapped up in heaviness. I appreciate and adore the atmospheric sound of that record and all it’s experimentations.

PS5,fobnf0a,t1_foausk4,1587661617.0,"I think you misunderstood what I meant by mentioning folders specifically.
 
The deign of the folder system is akin to the XMB in functionality. In order to access, you scroll downwards. To access content, you scroll horizontally. 

While folders worked a bit differently in XMB, the GUI design choices are pretty apparent not just in folders but all across the interface in general. 

My point being, which it seems you do understand, is there is clear remnants of XMB and design influences from their legacy GUI."
PS5,foacihn,t1_fo9vd8t,1587644376.0,"I don’t entirely agree nor disagree. Especially when you add folders, the similarities become even more apparent. 

They are very different in some key ways, but in some others, are quite similar."
