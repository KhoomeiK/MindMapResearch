depression,fp2koug,t3_gav2bj,1588263411.0,You are very strong for dealing with all of this. Know that things won’t always be like this and life will get better.
depression,fp2kjai,t3_gavled,1588263334.0,You can help him by being there and supporting him. I’m sure he’ll be glad to just have you by his side. Continue to have hope that opportunities will come.
depression,fp2jhj9,t3_gax1zy,1588262819.0,I can’t seem to treasure the good things about my life either. I have so many things to be grateful for but I feel empty inside. I find no aspirations or goals to push me to live. I have no reason to wake up I just want to sleep forever.
depression,fp2j6yf,t3_gaxgoo,1588262674.0,I find life suffocating as hell too and use dramas and webtoon as a means to escape. Reality means having to face that I am a anxious mess with no one to blame but myself.
depression,fldle4b,t3_fo6pji,1585066863.0,I’m happy that the lockdown is forcing me to be inside. I hate interacting with the real world. No more social anxiety. Less comparing everyone’s better life to my own cos they’re all in home. It probably bad of me to think like this after all the damage the disease has caused to other people. But self isolation was something I wanted.
depression,fldkyvz,t3_fo6y02,1585066617.0,It really does suck to have an inferiority complex. I have one too. It’s like everything I do doesn’t measure up to what an average person can do. And I just don’t want to be below average. I just can’t seem to find my worth anywhere.
depression,fh7r7fo,t3_f1djgl,1581342458.0,"Yes I understand that too. For me I like being depressed because otherwise I would feel average, one of the masses. When I’m depressed at least I become ‘special’ in a sense. Where I can self pity myself. Obviously a very toxic mindset."
depression,ff4kje8,t1_ff3f3sm,1579565839.0,My parents believe suicide is cos you’re weak
depression,ff2nev6,t1_ff1pmk8,1579514734.0,"Yes!! I love Taoism I’ve been meaning to learn more about it. But there’s this theory (you have probably seen it in the ying yang) of balance. The sun balances the moon, good balances bad that is the way of nature. These Taoist were captured by the enemy and they didn’t break a sweat. Their  captors asked them why they weren’t afraid and they replied, it’s because we know there will be good times ahead these bad times are only temporary and will not last forever. Or something in those lines. Taoist are mother fucking badasses."
depression,ff2n66e,t1_ff2m74h,1579514355.0,We are humans we adapt and there is hope. Finding similar like minded individuals who can advocate change is the best way to help our crumbling society. I only hope there is enough time.
depression,ff2n3mq,t1_ff2lsbz,1579514247.0,"This is truly my opinion but we are living way longer than we are functional. 
Of course I don’t want my parents to die if need be but when they are unable to get up in the morning, to shower, to cook for themselves. The mental and physical toll of seeing yourself so weak I can understand. If you are old and believe you have lived a good life, contributed well to society and have nothing more to do. I think it is okay to give them the decision to pass on to the next life and whether they want to tell their families or not. To me that is the solution to bring back the balance."
depression,ff2mw4s,t1_ff21eru,1579513925.0,"I agree with you do not get me wrong I love technology. I’m always with my phone. Human advancement is a good thing.

Cities are great. I love visiting new cities to experience the lifestyle over there. And so I believe we can take parts of city life like all the wonderful things you have described. And remove all the bad parts. Remove the pollution, waste, competition, chemicals, factories, over eating.

Bring back bicycles, renewable energy sources, smaller communities, social media awareness, music, festivals, dancing, electrically powered public transport. 

It’s so funny to me how people pay to go to the gym for a workout when they could take out their bike and ride to work, or the shopping centre."
depression,ff2ml1n,t1_ff1uzzc,1579513441.0,"Yes it’s time the big corporates go back into their mansions. And we start giving a fuck about nature, our religions, our culture, our animal rights, our ethics. One man told me political leaders shouldn’t be leading our country. It should be the spiritual leaders who have the final say because they are the ones encoded with the ethics we need to coexist. Back during medieval times the kings listened to the church. It was only when church leaders fell from their pedestal to do bad things, that’s when faith in the church was lost and kings rose into power. Now it’s the corporates whispering into the politician’s ears and how ethical are they?"
depression,ff2m9py,t1_ff207e9,1579512952.0,"Thank you that is something I needed to hear. It’s nice to know someone has a similar opinion to me when I’ve been looked down for feeling this way , when my depression has been looked down upon as ‘dramatic.’ The rules will only change if we voice our opinions more and someday they will I believe that too :)"
