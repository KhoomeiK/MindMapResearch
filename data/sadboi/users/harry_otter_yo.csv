The fact that he said one way or another..wtf does that mean? Like he's going to get rid of the dog? I don't trust anyone who can harm an animal. The fact he was holding your dogs head against the ground and hurting her makes my blood boil. 
I bet your dog peeing inside has more to do with your boyfriend than the roombas. 
He isn't worth staying in a relationship with and I hope for your dogs sake you end it. I don't trust him not to hurt your dog again."

I used to walk my dog, come back up, leave the door open(I lived on the second floor of a two story apartment complex) go inside with my dog, let her off the leash and get her settled, get my bag and go to work. One day I thought to myself if someone wanted to hurt me they'd see this was my routine and know it would give them a window where I was vulnerable. So yeah I'm paranoid and lock my shit."

If you have any understanding whatsoever about reproduction, then surely you can make the choice to avoid having kids. Obviously accidents happen with birth control but don't complain that you have kids when you could have easily prevented it.
