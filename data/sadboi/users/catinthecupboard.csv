Here’s the thing about grief and time: it’s complicated. The moment your mother was diagnosed he began the grieving process. It’s what you do when a potential terminal illness takes over. He’ll grieve her the rest of his life. But you don’t get to truly see that. You never will. You get to see the scrape of the surface he is willing to share with his kids. The rest is a deeply personal private rock he will chip away at. And grief is unique for everyone. No one knows how they will deal with it until it happens. It might seem shocking to you, but how you grieve your partner will be shocking to your kids too. 

You also have no clue what your parents discussed before her death. Probably a hundred things no child ever wants to hear. 

It might feel too soon to you because there is a natural fear and anger that happens in these situations. You might be an adult but every kid’s first thought is usually ‘you can’t replace her’. He’s not. What he is doing is accepting that companionship is a vital necessity to his personal health and happiness. He’s lucky in that he does not have to start from scratch. He has a woman he has always known and cared for that cares for him too and now they want to attempt something new. It’s the next chapter, but it does not paper over the last chapter. You need every one to build the book. 

This woman is only a stranger to you. To him she is a piece of home and renewed life he is looking at as a beacon of comfort. That’s another issue: your father is also a separate entity that is not just your dad, or his wife’s husband. He had and has a life outside of all that, and I bet mom knew a lot about it. But it’s tough to witness that. This is the stage in life where he makes choices that are purely about him. Parents largely make choices influenced by their children’s happiness. So situations like this hurt way more because they feel out of reference. 

Him moving seems to be some of the biggest hurt here. I think a big disservice that has been done to you is how far you have been kept from the family in England UNLESS they were abusive. It’s tough because it isn’t home to you. It is for him though. Home in Australia was made with your mother. That home no longer truly exists. The memories are probably painful and he relives them every day. Perhaps it will feel more like home when his new wife is there as he works towards retirement. Perhaps it will be emotionally healthier for him to go to England. Until the dust settles these are all just ‘plans’ yet to be executed.

He’s not crazy. 

You are not crazy. 

All of this is unfortunately pretty normal. 

Pushing her away will not influence this to stop. 

You can put a hard line on this. At some point he will do the same with you. 

You get to choose how the rest of your relationship with your father looks like right now. 

My personal opinion? If you can afford therapy do it, it will help. And there is no excuse in this digital age to KEEP her as a stranger unless you want her to be one. Her being in another country has nothing to do with it, you can all remedy that really quickly. Don’t use it as an excuse. If you don’t want to know her, own it."

Always. I am almost always busy with something. Particularly when I am at my desk and you can visibly see me working. “Do you have time to talk?” is a far better question because it gets to the root of the issue.

I don’t know why this irks me but it does. 

And with family (for ultimate pettiness): “Any plans today?” If I had plans I would have announced it. I will announce it when I do. Having plans later did not mean I had plans earlier and kept it from you."

I also take kratom daily. 

Everything does something different for my body and together they all work a harmony that eases different facets of suffering for me.

I filled and finished my nails, then painted (and cured) with three coats of Miracle Gel, and then started working on this bad boy. I want everyone to appreciate this quality work. You too can get a thumb that weighs 1 lb by using undercured hard gel and cheap rhinestones. Start by slapping one on, going ‘that’s not right’ and never. giving. up. 

Also did anyone notice how I cured my Miracle Gel? When I got the load of gems off I finally started poking at my nails and realized that wasn’t right either. Miracle Gel is not a UV product. It does however dry pretty quickly because I was mostly fooled until I really started to touch them.

It’s a little mish-mashed because I was trying to  (and had to) use up some extras on my shelf due to running out of staples and not being able to rebuy until recently. This is listed from top to bottom, left to right. Not included is a Hada Labo Moist Lotion and Mentholatum Lipbalm. Both bangers and staples in my routine. 

My skin is combo. Dry from the cheek down, oilier nose and forehead, blackheads nose and chin. My skin likes to wriggle in moisture. I am always targeting redness and red flares. 

Cosrx Propolis Light Ampoule 30ml

They named this whole line ‘light’. I scoff! When Cosrx came out with a new propolis lineup I was pumped and bought it all. Packaging is cute, and I am a sucker for slathering bee goodies on my face. This ampoule is supposed to protect, enhance radiance and moisturize. The texture is thick, matching the honey hive vibe on the lid. Spreads smoothly and has a barely there scent. The whole line has a faint scent of... bee product. Not quite honey not quite wax not quite pollen. It’s entirely pleasant and vaguely natural yet medicinal. I like it. This is absolutely moisturizing, you feel it immediately by the weight and almost occlusive warmth quality this has. It feels good on! Would I say I felt an increase in radiance? Yes, particularly when using the whole line together. Huge? No. But this is a great line and ampoule for nourishing and moisturizing. Will buy again at some point!

Elizavecca CF-Nest 97% B-jo Serum 50ml

I bought this, tried it, and stuffed it to the back of the shelf until the end of March when I got laid off and ran out of other serums. I imagine a lot of us are digging into the shelf cause of COVID! Reasons I did not like it: the dropper sucks, the product is loose and the dropper is terrible so you easily spill, and I found it never really absorbed well or did much. It’s supposed to enhance elasticity, improve moisture and leave you dewy and healthy. When I went back to it I moved it around in my routine until it finally absorbed. It had to be placed at the base of things, right after my spritz and tone and before anything else. After that it was fine. I am sure it helped add moisture but I never saw solid benefits. It’s scentless which is a plus. Won’t buy again. If you do be careful of spills!

Scinic Propolis Ampoule 95 30ml

I always like this. It’s chock full of quality ingredients. I know Scinic had another (now retired) propolis thing people loved, but I hope this guy receives more popularity. This is a solidly made product that nourishes and hydrates. Thicker smoothe texture, little scent if any. The packaging is nice too, sturdy. I have dropped it and while my Mizon Black Snail AIO bit the dust (sob, literally day of lay off, smash) this sucker seems to just bounce off my hard bathroom tile and scoff at its audacity to threaten its power. I will buy again. 

Skin1004 Madagascar Centella Ampoule 100ml

This was a plateau breaker for me! It is highly reviewed and a cult staple from what I can see and it deserves its praise. By time I started this my redness was well stabilized but still there. This helped notch it down. Very thin almost watery, lots in the bottle, barely scented. Requires finesse to apply by fingers but the dropper is quality (Elizavecca take notes). I will buy again. I have been trying to buy again. I can’t seem to find it for under $80 including shipping that won’t take months. I am going to have to just orded and wait a while I think. 

Murad Hydration Prebiotic 3-in-1 MultiMist  100ml

Found this at my last pre-covid Marshalls haul. (Good day. Found Dr. Jart too.) I mostly ignore Murad but I am a mist junkie so this caught my eye. It has yeast peptides, niacinamide and ‘hydrating sugars’. It has a strong scent. I liked it but if you are sensitive to scents then this will be too perfumed. Now, the smell tickled me. There was a beachie style barbie in the 90s that came with this little bottle of perfume. This smell reminded me strongly of that one. I found it was not as hydrating as I need it to be. Nice, but mostly forgettable to me. The mister was on point however! I won’t buy again. 

Missha Misa Cho Gong Jin Essence 50ml

I bought this because pinknblossom was having a big sale and I have always been curious about this line. The packaging is pretty, it’s expensive, and to my greedy crow eye it seemed exciting. It has a strong fragrance but man... I could wriggle in it. I LOVE the smell. I don’t know what it is, but it is lovely. It smells lux. Did you ever peek up at a makeup counter as a kid, sneaking a whiff of some dramatic for grown women with fancy bags product while your mom bought perfume? This takes me there. As for the product itself... nice! Thicker light brown (herbal color I suppose) serum consistency, applies smoothly. Supposed to be anti-aging and brightening. There was a time where besides my spray and toner and moisturizer this was the only think I was using, and my skin did really well. No dryness, managed my redness well, and seemed to just overall be fine. I am definitely interested in buying again and checking out the rest of the line. 

Cosrx Propolis Light Cream 65ml

This has become my favorite moisturizer! Part of that new propolis line. The jar looks small but you don’t need a lot of this cream, and I go through product quickly because a pea-sized amount of anything does not usually work for me. This cream feels on the thicker side but spreads well and settles without feeling heavy. That being said, it is richly moisturizing. My skin absorbs it quickly. Same vague smell as the rest of the line, maybe slightly stronger. 

Etude House Soon Jung Hydro Barrier Cream 75ml

I have used the emulsion from the same line and really enjoyed it so this was a cream I was excited to try. Unfortunately I didn’t love it! Lots of product, almost no scent, the texture is a cream but I felt it had some gel similarities to it. Thicker cream, application was nice and smooth, but I found this cream felt a little gloopier than I expected. I use a heavy cream in the evenings to give my face a boost and this one never quite 100% absorbed or dried down. So I ended up with quite a collection of pillow fuzz the next morning. I won’t buy again, but will pursue others in the same line. 

Missha Super Aqua Cell Renew Snail Cream 52ml

Another sale purchase at pinknblossom for all the same reasons as the other Missha above! I also love snail products and feel my skin does excellently with them. This is a lightweight gel cream that melted into my skin when applied, creating a thin layer that was easy to spread. I found it cooling, moisturizing enough, and definitely felt like it increased firmness and plumped. The scent is an almost cucumber freshness. I liked this quite a bit, enough that when I was recently financially able to take advantage of another great sale, I bought two more products in the line to check out. So far nothing has disappointed. I will buy again. Missha has impressed me to be honest. 

BioDerma Sensitive Micellar Water 500ml

I buy this bulk at Shoppers when they put the 2 packs on a big sale and stash them like a squirrel. I get the sensitive because my skin is a fuss. Works fine for makeup, and I use it daily as my primary skin cleansing. No complaints here, just a good work horse that never makes me question why I spend money on it. (Elizavecca. Again. The dropper.)"

They’re the bar soap and nothing else face washers who are glowing at 85. Their bodies exist solely on doritos with nary a pound gained. Thry use 2-in-1 from the dollar store and come out with luscious locks. But I don’t count them as anything but one of the anomalies of life.

Money helps, it really does.

Another sign of true wealth is perfectly fitting clothing and stuff that lasts a long time. $500 work boots can literally be ‘oh these old things? I bought them ten yeard ago’ because they are meant to last. People with money tailor. Their wardrobe fits beautifully in a way it never does off the rack because they make it fit.

I only get salty about it when people try and claim everyone could have boatloads if they just worked harder or stopped drinking coffee. In my experience though, people of true wealth aren’t the ones making that commentary though. They know how they got there. A lack of coffee doesn’t usually make it."

Grief and grieving is normal, however long it takes you. You are allowed to suffer it. You are allowed to wallow in it when you need to. You are allowed to talk about it. Holding it back makes grief harder to deal with because you never quite release it. 

It’s normal if it is short or long. Normal to five years later have a random ‘oh no’ moment that slams into you. The wave will wash away and the shore dries up. 

The only time grieving is troubled is when it inhibits your ability to live your life for an extended period of time. Then you may want and need to seek help. Heck, you might want to anyways! One of my most useful events was my therapy session a month after my cat passed. I went in not intending to discuss it and spent the whole time on it. The relief was so huge after.

Skincare_Addiction,foqqwl8,t3_g90nu0,1587999186.0,"For me I had to do a multi-step attack. First remove the flake. Moisturizing a flake does not get rid of that flake. I used physical exfoliation on that area. Then I assessed my regiment and added an extra moisture layer. For me this is a thin Japanese lotion (Hada Labo Moist, the milky one, white/pink bottle) that helps prep my whole face. Without that layer no amount of moisture helps. My favorite regular moisturizer (I had to upgrade this, mine was not originally strong enough) on my whole face, and a pack/mask/extra cream around my sensitive zone before bed and even in the morning if it looks extra touchy. I favor Avene’s Cicalfate cream. My fav for that ugly post-cold upper lip and dealing with unexpected skin rebellion. 

I wash, exfoliate as needed and when needed,  spritz with whatever toner I am working on (usually moisture focused), lotion, spritz, essence, ampoule or serum, moisturizer, pack. 

I have combo skin, with my entire lower face dry and flaking around my nose and corners of the mouth. I am able to maintain a flake free balance now. It took a while.

It is a delight that suddenly everything has largely been made accessible. Suddenly it is no longer a virtue to grind by and struggle. It’s also aggravating. The disability community is pretty salty atm. Shit people have been told cannot be done and how dare you ask was implemented in a few days. 

I am privileged to be able to work. I work full time. Right when this was heating up our office prepped for work at home. Then we got laid off. My work environment is financially unstable and emotionally toxic. With CERB and EI I am safe at home and it’s scary but almost calm. I don’t give all my last vestiges of energy to work so I can cook and eat well. I can clean and sort clutter when I have the strength. And I am not angry all the time. I don’t angry cry that much. I’m less anxious. I am stressed, this whole situation is frightening. And I do NOT want this to be forever. But I want the world to take some valued lessons from what we can do for people who need extra support. And I also know I need to find a way out of my current situation. I have to make changes. I don’t know what they are yet but something is going to change."

It’s been two months since I took off my nails after a bad incident with a new builder product. (Terrified of polygel now. Btw, pro-tip from a dummy, do ONE nail with a new build product. Not all ten. That way if you don’t agree with it, you don’t butcher all your fingers.) I’m pretty rusty with shape and build but today was the day to do a new set and I love this color and couldn’t wait to use these gems. My first go encrusting an entire nail.

Besides double checking that, are your primer and foundation fighting against each other and/or your skincare? If things don’t agree with the layer beneath then it won’t do anything good. I’d write out your routine, in detail, check ingredients and see what maybe is out of whack. It can be way smaller than expected and set the whole thing off."

The weirdest hiring case I have ever had though was one guy who did email, and he interviewed well, great resume, but there was something off we could not place. Just a feeling that something was not right. So we said we would let him know we just had a few more interviews and it would be decided next week. He phones me the next morning to tell me that he would be away from his phone for most of the day and was very interested. And then he phoned me when he was back. He phoned multiple times a day for a few days. It creeped everyone out. I was caught between wanting to find out how long this would carry on and just wanting it to stop. Told him it was filled.

I bought these during the Black Friday sale. They were dispatched quickly and arrived fast via post into Canada. Every polish was well packed in its own little bubble envelope into the box. Small box for the right fit. Polish itself is richly colored and every one is so unique and layered with pigment, shine, and glitter. It’s the right consistency - not too thin, not too thick. I did two coats but you could definitely see its beauty with just one. Brush was a nice size. Packaging is cute. Overall great experience. If you have been wondering they are absolutely as good as they look. I’m hooked! It was so hard to choose and I will be definitely using up my polish budget there. 

(Top Coat is Seche Vite. Polish was shiny enough that in a pinch you could do with it on its own.)"
