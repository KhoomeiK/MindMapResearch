BPD,f2csj2h,t3_dctwt0,1570141998.0,"Wow I totally would do this. Jumping to the worst possible conclusion of being forgotten/excluded and then feeling shame and anger and fully hating that person and putting them in the toxic bucket. Thanks for sharing, this contexts really helps me understand splitting more."

BPDmemes,f1diyvn,t1_f1dh0rf,1569385796.0,"Itâ€™s ok, I grew up poor as fuck and my parents were basically kids from a third world country in America when they had my brother. Poverty, cultural and language barriers,  and lack of education sucks man. Hoping to be better for the next generation if I decide to have kids. Trying to learn how to forgive my parents. Shits hard man, but gotta keep tryin."
BPDmemes,f1diszx,t1_f1dgjti,1569385629.0,"Do it. Being judged for being sick fucking sucks, but itâ€™s courageous to go in and try to figure out how to get better. Baby steps. Nothing big needs to happen. Also, this is their job, and if theyâ€™re dicks report them."

BPD,f0k7xuj,t1_f0hb0w1,1568672609.0,"Yeah thereâ€™s always a possibility for that, but tbh that risk (for me at least,) is worth it. Iâ€™m also managing this with a doctor and if I feel worse or there are any side affects thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d bring up.  Iâ€™ve been on a wide variety of meds and while I wish there was one magic pill, I had to try a bunch to figure out what works. Itâ€™s an ongoing process."

Also where did you read that? Iâ€™d love to read as well as I learn more about this. Thanks!"

BPD,f08y2tn,t3_d47pxj,1568490151.0,"Yeah when I brought up my new diagnosis to my counselor she jumped to tell me that I shouldnâ€™t tell ppl about it because it had such a stigma. A friend decided to stop being my friend after all of this. It sucks.

Edit: spelling"
BPD,f04oulf,t1_f03ma0g,1568392271.0,"How do you manage rejection sensitivity? I mean I have so much to learn, but I think I get really angry when friends are assholes (or my bpd mind thinks theyâ€™re assholes,) and then I get all rage fire in my pit the world is ending feeling and I lash out.  Based on your experiences, how do you manage that anger and fear of abandonment?"

BPD,ezt800i,t3_d23wbp,1568123785.0,Yaâ€™ll are amazing. Iâ€™m so new to this and the sub is really helping feel not alone as I learn about the diagnoses and my friends seem to lack empathy.
BPDmemes,ezqota6,t1_ezqcmbe,1568062087.0,"Yeah Iâ€™m trying to work on that. I feel like give a lot, but I expect a lot and then ppl let me down and itâ€™s devastating.  How does one feel/care less?"
BPD,ezpwme6,t3_d1m5hm,1568050252.0,Same. I canâ€™t tell if itâ€™s my meds or not. Feel like it is.
BPDmemes,eznkt4l,t1_ezmu7c1,1568007446.0,Good point. Then when would you recommend the best time to open up yourself be?
BPDmemes,ezm3avi,t3_d1e4yf,1567985734.0,Omg yes. How do you know when to actually tell someone? I have people talk to me about their traumas and then I share or expect too much and I end up losing that friend. Any suggestions? Sometimes Iâ€™m scared no one will understand me and that Iâ€™m too much of a difficult person to be friends with.
