But I have a few core values and one of them is live to your integrity.  

Bottom line- see her whenever you want just tell me. And itâ€™s the part to the story that he is missing. 

I guess I could just ask him to send me a text or tell me in person? Idk"

lululemon,fko04i1,t1_fknz0xv,1584377458.0,"When you find one that fits you please let me know. I wear rebrok sports bra. I can send you the link if you want. I wear 32DD and my choice of sports are swimming, biking, running and rock climbing. I can get away with wear the align tank for rick climbing but I prefer High support for spinning and running"
lululemon,fk8lqf3,t3_fh2yqe,1583958443.0,"In movement ( my favorite)... 

fast and free. The best part about fast and free is there are two pockets so you can keep your car key in a pocket and a tissue or whatever in the other pocket. The pockets are wonderful. The fabric is awesome and there is a draw string.  

My other favorites are the speed up tight. Same situation with these guys, two pockets- the difference between the fast and frees and speed up is the fabric and the compression. The speed up has more compression ( in my opinion)

The fast and free shorts are bomb as well. I run long distance in those when itâ€™s warm out. Please try them for they are amazing.

I am a half marathon runner and no matter what I sweat through my tights. I am racing in the dc rick n roll half marathon at the end of the month and I will be wearing one of the three mentioned above. Probably whichever is clean that morning Lol"

I know that they do not hav pockets but man oh man they definitely are in my top 5 favorite workout tights.  I especially love my in movements for long distance runs and spinning.  They stay up for high intensity workouts whereas the wunder unders donâ€™t so i will def miss ordering the in movements. Funny because I tried ordering another pair about 3 weeks ago but they were sold out in my size, size 6."
lululemon,fgxleap,t3_ezuok9,1581173985.0,"I am using them for indoor bouldering and I have been climbing for about 2 months now and I typically wear my aligns when I boulder.  I donâ€™t like wearing my aligns for clip in or top rope climbing.  I def will not wear them for outdoor climbing.  (Side note- i do get hot in my  align joggers when I boulder but I donâ€™t get hot in the 
 leggings) 

..  I want to start outdoor climbing any weekend now so I will be searching for new climbing pants soon,  what do you usually wear when you climb?  

P.S.  I like feeling cute when Iâ€™m climbing cause there are so many guys.. sooo many people every time I climb and I have terrible social anxiety most times when I climb / mostly because I am so new to the community.  

Random question- what do you do to warm up for rock climbing? I do not have a routine right now but I want to put a few stretches together maybe even run a mile before I get started climbing."

adhdwomen,fb0fhes,t1_faxgvhc,1576425560.0,"I totally know the feeling of going public places alone.   It is so uncomfortable. 

I recently started rock climbing. And the other day I went by myself and I really really really wanted to rock climb but I needed someone to belay me.  So I went wayyy out of my comfort zone and went up to a complete stranger, Mind you I was so uncomfortable that my vision was borderline hazy, and asked him to belay me and we ended rock climbing for 3-4 hours and had the absolute best time of my life.

Sometimes I forget to just let life takes its course.  And sometimes I forget that I am pretty and I can talk to people and I am confident as hell.  

Life is filled with soooo many unexpected surprises and blessings if we as humans could just take a moment to stop what we are doing to really embrace and look at what Is in front of us."

AdvancedRunning,f8bvlod,t3_dzvxok,1574446351.0,My best advice is to plan out your run- which pace/gate/ music selection you will be listening too at each mile for the mile.  I used to feel this way but it just meant FOR ME that I wasnâ€™t pushing myself hard enough.  Moral of the Story is evaluate your run goals and gravitate your workouts to reach your goals and your boredom will vanish instantly.

Even if you are tired you will not sleep.  Do yourself a favor and just keep track of time when you take xr! Feel free to message me with any questions cause I used to be prescribed ir now I am prescribed xr.
