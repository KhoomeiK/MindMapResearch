kundalini,fpv5jso,t1_fp94tg6,1588935642.0,"No not scared but curious, cuz when this process starts the part of the brain which controls ur reflexes (tells u to react when u r scared) actually cuts off connection, which is a good thing, so you are no more scared of ghosts or any type of other mystical creatures!!

I was getting up every night at like 3:00 am and all, then one day all of a sudden I felt my feet get extremely hot as if someone was standing in front of me and I heard someone singing , it was so nice and soothing but it soon became high pitched and my ears couldn't hear it anymore. My advice is just go with the flow!!!"

But after doing it I still had that power, I con still control my urges but this quarantine has made me bored so I try to watch it. Look u can't avoid the inevitable, the one thing that happens during Kundalini is that u need more sleep and I don't get sleep at all!!!! So my advice is just clasps ur both hands and keep meditating u will feel the heat through ur hands that's when u know u are awakening my friend ðŸ™‚."

But I think abt killing myself plus start getting random thoughts abt ppl around me, while sleeping I get dreams that even I can't remember and my parents keep telling me that I was speaking while sleeping. So for me even sleeping is out of the question, but I am happy that it works for u m8!!"
depression,fm0j3s3,t1_flzwupr,1585659154.0,"I experience the same things so I either switch off my phone and don't talk to anyone or I never pick up any calls. It just feels so good to be alone, uk. I just can't say bad to anyone, cuz then I would end up either feeling bad or start thinking bad abt myself. Look I try to be the best version of myself wherever I go, but sometimes after being nice to everyone at the end of the day u feel depressed, it's like I am sure I don't wanna be affected by others opinions, but turns out u can't avoid it cuz that's how some ppl's f*cking brain is!!!!!"

depression,fl4w4o8,t3_fm77ql,1584822861.0,"Look man ik how u feel, I had migraine for like a month and I didn't go to school, ppl started calling me and were worried abt me(not true) but then when I went to school I saw that everybody didn't care well some of em did but then I realized that they all were just curious and nobody cared uk. Look m8 u can't control anyone around u !!!
U see m8 life is like sailing on a still river u can't go and increase the water level or uk even decide where it flows sometimes all u can do is just sit in ur boat(body) and embrace urself for whatever comes and just control it(boat). Giving up would be a coward's way out dawg, look ik u feel there is no other way out or something but pls don't do it m8 just try to go through this phase, I fu*king promise u that later in life u r gonna see urself and be like 'I am glad I didn't do this sh*t!'."
depression,fkydigx,t3_flb3fe,1584646586.0,"Look there is no point in being afraid of something u didn't do (only if what u r telling is true). I am sure nobody saw this coming but u can't avoid the inevitable my friend. Look rn u gotta do what u feel, but I see that's what ur question is so...... 
Go and pay ur respects(I am sure u already would've done it) or u could go and explain that u know nothing abt it(which could give a sign of guilt but I think it'll be a nice gesture). The last thing if you don't wanna do any of it just txt her brother back 'I am sorry for ur loss', and follow up if he asks u a couple of questions just answer them normally and don't get panicked or something cuz u didn't do anything. Follow any of them or try anything elseðŸ™‚."
depression,fkwklcr,t3_fl0jwh,1584595410.0,"I used to live that way my friend, and believe me there is nothing but hopelessness on this path. Ppl who stay alive for the sake of others are heartbroken most of the time in their lives. The only way to live your life is by being unconditionally nice to yourself and in ur case I would agree that u have fun in helping ppl but pls m8 don't forget abt urself while u help others ðŸ™‚."
depression,fkqeo1t,t3_fjthj0,1584442971.0,"I stopped going to school for a month, bcoz of migraine and guess what it was the most fucked up month uk why? Cuz I had dreams and used to get scared of it, had a lot of hallucinations and I even thought of committing suicide, my studies had gone into the gutters(it's still the same), but at the end when I went to school I became more depressed, while some ppl cared for me it didn't lasts for that long uk. I became the same guy being ignored by the people for some reason. But I saw myself deep down inside, that I was becoming mature that's cuz before this I used to be a attention wh*re who used  to do fuck*d up shit to get ppl near me but I told to myself not  anymore. In the first place I started thinking abt it while I was at home the whole month and I realized I have been alone (lonely actually) my whole fu*king life. Some ppl are actually good friends of mine but I try to be with the ppl and help others that has just broken my soul in a way that I am trying to heal myself from it. Ik  I am not a celebrity but even I sometimes need ppl who actually care abt me, not who just wanna know cuz of their Curiousness uk.... 
So friend if u think u are alone don't think so, if u don't wanna go out that's just cuz of being scared, believe me when I go out I see ppl staring back at me, and I feel like was he staring at me or somebody else, I mean that Kind of feeling should be avoided cuz you are a man of ur own and nobody can take your identity away from u. U can also just go out and stay near ur house to have a good breeze of fresh air(in the morning ofc). At the end I would say ppl get up everyday in the whole world cuz they have hope that something new(or bad which is actually challenging) will happen to them and they will enjoy and fight it respectively, cuz m8 all we have in our lives is to just HOPE that some day our life turns out to be a little better."
depression,fkqdin6,t1_fkq93xx,1584441612.0,"Well that's a view from one side but what if the person u care abt doesn't care u back, I mean what if u keep helping that person more and more and more. But he/she doesn't realize and ends up going with other ppl (who are actually good!!) but u end up being alone. Uk its just using other person to get charged, and then going away with the others, u see that person u helped sometimes doesn't realize how important u were, he/she would just ignore and go away. I would call it at first a stupid mistake done by the person who tried to help, only later not to be  thanked or given attention at the end."
