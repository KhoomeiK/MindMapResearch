classicwow,eub1c9p,t1_euasj4a,1563637328.0,"You can just as easily blame capitalism for the golden age of Blizzard gaming that happened and we all got to enjoy.

Capitalism is good because it lets us the consumer ultimately have all the power. Big game companies are disappointing us with their releases but you know who’s killing it? All these indie companies making amazing games. I like to use Hollow Knight as an example, an indie game I bought for $14 and put 100 plus hours in.

Capitalism is not the problem."
Christianity,etuia19,t1_etufmfr,1563213155.0,"Mary of Bethany is likely the one who anoints Jesus's feet with perfume oil, a bold and loving act that was incredibly controversial amongst his disciples who Jesus then rebuked after they attempted to scold her for her act of love. She did this in a room full of men... Doesn't sound meek to me, sounds like a strong woman.  


Esther and Deborah are responsible for saving many lives.  And there are other stories."

Song of Songs, Psalms, Proverbs, Ruth, Esther and every book in the New Testament.

I was consumed with him. Overtime he’s lost his ability to dive in and go ham and the community learned that focusing him was pretty easy and effective. I really believe this will help, but you will have to use cooldowns effectively or be punished."
heroesofthestorm,eqowuee,t1_eqoukwy,1560193429.0,"Chen has more then one viable build. They are all niche and completely dependent upon your comp and the other team’s comp. It’s why he’s so damn hard to play and get value out of, because mistalenting can screw up your whole game. This is a big buff. He will be much harder to kill while sitting in the backline now."
heroesofthestorm,eqovsfn,t1_eqolh21,1560193112.0,"Level 117 Chen here. They are buffs. He now has more utility, more active mitigation that takes place outside the drink while still having it and he will have more sustain damage but less burst. They’ve also made him more complicated to play."
