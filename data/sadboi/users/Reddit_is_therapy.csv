Could you give an update to your comment if you've come across any new information?

I agree that oils can denature capsid proteins, dehydrate them, but the preservation in a micelle doesn't make sense to me. There has to be some level of physical contact between the surface proteins of the virus and the oil. The outward-facing portion of the surface proteins is hydrophilic. How could this lead to the preservation of the virus?

>airborne viruses are much smaller (and therefore lighter) than coronaviruses and therefore can be pushed by the wind.

DrugNerds,fi14yxu,t1_f9vl3qa,1582050725.0,"An easy to refer to mental model could be this:

There are **a lot** of neurons in the brain. Head of a neuron has projections called dendrites and the tails of neurons can release chemicals called neurotransmitters.

There are 100s of neurotransmitters in the brain. What they do is pass on information from one neuron to the next. 

If the body relied on chemicals like these to physically travel for transmitting information, it'd be very slow. So what happens is that there are *receptors* on the dendrites. 

A neuron releases neurotransmitters aka information, and they go bind to those receptors on the dendrite of another neuron. This traveling is done in something called the *Synapse*.

Upon binding, the receptors receive a jolt of electricity. The receptor of some compound X would only get that kind of jolt from X or stuff closely related to X. 

Now, there's a lot of ignorance on this, so I'll clarify that neurotransmitters by themselves are not any special molecules. It's just that different areas of brains have different neurotransmitters.

For example, the neurons involved in controlling motor skills, like controlling your muscles, walking, etc use a neurotransmitter called Dopamine. Turns out that dopamine is also used by a different area of the brain where the neurons using it are processing information related to feeling emotions.

Yeah that's correct, but now starting to make the most of it. I'm associating different triggers with what I'm doing and what I want to do, so timers force me to stop doing what I'm doing and I have to be mindful of the fact that while I'm good at execution, I'm really bad at switching tasks. 

Remembering this usually pushes me now to switch the tasks.
Also, I read a lot and figuring out who I am and what I wanna do recently, so I am doing all the things I wanna do now. Like, even when I'm doing something (x) while avoiding something else (y), I'm aiming that the X is also some thing that I wanna do - basically taking control of actions, being active in what I do, not passively letting life happen to me.

>Depression is still a chemical thing too. Your brain just don't have enough happy chemicals /is unable to produce this much. So medication is great to break this cycle. Work together with therapy thought to learn to cope better with stuff to stay independent of meds if possible.

>Starting is the hardest. Altogether I can only really work when people are around. I'm already texted a friend cause I wanna work on weekends.

I'm actually pretty thankful for you to ask, cause that's how I red my comment from month ago. My life has improved a lot. Most importantly. I'm not constantly desperate. Also I just had my first test period at university without breaking down or at least be thrown into an depression period.

That's great! Most of the time I find it really difficult to appreciate that a lot of what I have today was once a dream of mine to have yet I take it all for granted.

>I'm texting with a fellow student who's adhd too a lot these days I just met cause I opened up. It's so great to be myself. And it's still taff but I'm okay and even happy generally.

Awesome! I've viewed these issues completely different. I don't think of people as good looking or bad looking. I think people look like what they look and that look may be appealing to me thus good or non-appealing to me aka bad but it may also be non-appealing to me yet appealing to someone else.

 Some popular actors are not good-looking, rather, they are looking like what they are and a large number of people find that appealing, but some people don't

Similarly, you may think you're being weird in public, or you'll embarass yourself if you do X, but it's not like that. You're not being weird. You're being yourself and some people may attach meaning to that as being weird because that's just not how *they* would act.

It's similar to cuss words: Fuck, shit, etc don't really mean anything by themselves. To a non-english person, they don't have any meaning. Their meaning depends on the context. A fuck can be a fuck-up, it can be sexual, it can be insulting, etc. It's the listener who attaches meaning, not the word.

All these analogies are for us, as humans. We don't really have to adapt to society or whatever people think. You just be yourself, and people will attach meaning to that. You can behave in ways that are what other people want you to do but they'll still attach meaning on their own and that's something we can't control.

Do we say intelligence is deriving from our behavior? I think it's because of our ability to predict, all the time. As I'm typing, I'm predicting what I'm going to type, and your mind is at the moment predicting the next word of the sentence.

Has anyone here read Hyperion Cantos books? It had similar themes


>There is a second intuition lurking unquestioned behind these stories: that the computer will actually be intelligent, by the very demanding criterion. This post looks at AI in 2019 and inspires a rival intuition.

We, humans, are intelligent and conscious. However, I can't think of a reason why the two must go hand in hand. I think that we could have intelligent beings not conscious, just like we have conscious beings (many animals, reptiles, etc) but who are not intelligent.

>What happens if AI simply optimizes to impress people?

A lot of people think that the scenario will be along these lines. If AI was given some task, it will follow those orders and optimize for best solution. If the task was to make person X happy, that person might be strapped to a bed and pumped full of drugs to keep him in the euphoric state.

Well, then that's another thing that we can introduce, especially with CV models getting really really good.

Good point 

>Don't make anyone wait excessively long for their ride

If a person is waiting on ground floor to go to floor 2, and the elevator is at floor 4 after coming back down from floor5. Someone at floor5 presses button, so elevator goes up. Someone at floor 2 presses button, and since it's in the way, it'd stop at floor 2 before floor 1.

Say, there are 5 people waiting on the ground floor to go to the second floor and one person on floor 1 wanting to go to ground. The elevator was at rest at floor 1 (one elevator in this ex) initially. What should be done if both pressed the button at the same time?

 It could be that the elevator has been preprogrammed to have priority of going in one direction, but again, if 6 people want to go down and 1 person up, and default direction is up, then it's not very optimal.

Had there been multiple elevators, perhaps they could've communicated and gone for each group."

>Pure statisticians often get caught up in solving a cool problem, and forget to think about the usefulness and application of the problem they're solving. If you go to JSM or any major stats conference, a Stat researchers talk usually starts with, ""Here's a cool problem, and heres a bunch of math about how I solved it.... and here is an obscure instance in which this might be useful"". A biostats talk usually starts with, ""Here was a real life medical problem that didn't have a solution, here are some stats and math I did to create a solution for this problem, and here is how it actually helped people."" 

This is very bad thinking. It's the pure statisticians who've given the tools to solve the problem others have solved. Without math and physics we won't have MRI scanners, no understanding of computation in brain, no ventilators. So saying that stats researchers are solving problems not applicable in real life is very ignorant.

Also, you've biased yourself by thinking that helping people is inherently a more valuable problem to be solved than other problems. Nature doesn't think so.
