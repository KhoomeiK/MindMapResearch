Yesterday at work, I overheard some co-workers commenting on a guy from 3rd shift that works out and stays in shape to eat more fattening foods and cakes. They're the same people that always talk about food and how they failed their diet and just gave up. My job mostly consists of people very out of shape and look like planets, so if anyone is trying to better themselves, they usually say ""ugh, look at you being healthy"" or if someone has a post-workout shake, they'll make it a point to say how much they love sweet tea and soft drinks.
