AsianBeauty,fqgonrc,t3_gisf4j,1589352212.0,"Hiya! I think my skin needs a bit more so Im thinking of introducing The ordinary's niacinamide 10% + zinc 1% to my skin care. Or should I go with Vit C instead? Maybe another active?

I have acne prone, dehydrated, oily skin i think? And the products i bought below really help but it's still a long way to a clear, glowy skin. I still have acne scars, redness and textures but nothing compared to how my skin looked before skin care.

I live in a very hot and humid country, only summer and typhoon season.

If you could give me your advice on these or other products or if I should use the alternatives i listed over the ones I bought that would really help. Thank you!

SkincareAddiction,fqec5nn,t1_fqe4gfy,1589305141.0,"I see, got it! Very easily confused as a moisturizer haha (at least for me)
Thanks again for differentiating and pointing out that I still need a moisturizer. 
Im liking Hada labo so far so I'll deffinitely look into your recommendations.

Have a good day/evening!"
SkincareAddiction,fqdxfg0,t1_fqdph2o,1589298267.0,"Yep! Tall kinda clear mostly white packaging with a red line between goku jyun. What about the premium one? Gold packaging. I read that its has a really rich formula can that one be counted as a moisturizer or maybe layer it?

Thank you for your help I appreciate it! :)"
SkincareAddiction,fqduxyh,t1_fqdq2dv,1589297041.0,"From my understanding Vit C makes your skin photosensitive and niacinamide does not. And as I haven't bought any spf ( I want to look for a good one thats locally available) I didn't look into Vit C. Also because of the general popularity and Liah Yoo recommends niacinamide. In addition from what I read that it helps with oil control.

Thank you for your suggestions! I'll definitely look and research for HA Serums/ Vit C and of course SPF :)"

Tachiyomi,fomc8xx,t1_fomardu,1587884901.0,"Okay. Just to be sure but is it possible that Im missing a folder stucture? Do extensions need to have a folder in tachiyomi? 

Mine just goes: 
Internal storage/Android/data/eu.kanade.tachiyomi.debug/(cache & files)

Files folder contains covers and downloads."
Tachiyomi,folc7bs,t1_fokehh9,1587859132.0,It just goes from pending for a while then retry. I have no network issues and I allowed unknown source installation.  Yep did download through the website and that works.
Tachiyomi,foj5dt9,t3_ft9s8l,1587809046.0,Hi! Im using preview r2112 (6d5b6b2f) and I still cant install or update extensions. Im sorry if Im misunderstanding anything but github says all systems are operational. Thank you.
LoveNikki,fnshz6p,t1_fnsefyh,1587222007.0,"That is what is worrying me. Its been a week, if Im right, since the update and I have contacted In game support. Im still coordinating with them but its been hard with this issue since I cant log in and all,  and they haven't given me any solution.

Really I haven't done anything, I just downloaded the update then bam. I want to fix this if its a problem with my phone before they roll out the hell event, but I've had this phone for 2 years and Love Nikki is one of the apps I installed first. I haven't had any major Issue till now.

Anyways, thank you :)"
