i knew that was going to be the start of a very unhealthy living situation because she’s already a very horrible person to begin with. this is emotional abuse! it’s exactly what Bob and your mom were putting you through. they’re controlling, and making you feel uncomfortable. i’m so sorry they put you through that. i think i honestly would’ve gotten into a fist fight with Bob about the cat and dog.. i commend you for not attacking like would’ve."
