They had a ton of infantry divisions, airborne was counted as infantry for numbering purposes, and 82nd and 101st survived till now. I can remember reading that the british 6th airborne (that was basically wiped out in market garden) was called the 6th so that the germans would wonder where airborne divisions 2-5 were."
DaystromInstitute,fqpimdu,t1_fqpfez6,1589547306.0,"101st was a not that unreasonable division number for the us army in ww2. There were only some of the numbers not active, but not all of them were frontline divisions. And after ww2 the 101st stuck, cause it wasnt  deactivated and keeping the number by tradition. I heard a rumour once, that tradition is pretty big for military people. Cant say if its true. /s

So im interested in seeing a pic where you wear a white or color dress thats form fitting and short and it has short sleeves, maybe there is a belt accentuating your hips. Your feet are in black heels maybe or not, whatever is comfortable. Sandals maybe. (do you dance a lot?) The dress has a wide cut in the front which gets narrower further down and reaches to your belly button, which one can barely see. Oh and maybe you wear one of those fine gold chains that accentuates the gap between your breasts (dont know what its called). And if the dress has a bit of lace, even better.

And as bonus maybe that white bodysuit?  :)"
