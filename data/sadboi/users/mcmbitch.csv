Hi guys! My husband and I are looking for a new home for our girl, Luna. Unfortunately her and our older dog don't get along anymore, and they just can't live together for any longer. 
Here's some stuff about her: 

- she's very smart. She learned her own name in 2 days and can learn a new trick in matter of hours. She knows sit, stay, shake and ""go crate"". 
- she can't live in a house with any other dogs. She is friendly with other dogs at the dog park, but she does have a dominance issue. I don't think she'd be good with cats either. 
- she's very energetic. She loves to play and run around. When she's super excited, she spins in circles like she's a windup toy. Her favorite toys right now are a bacon flavored hard toy and a stuffed sloth. 
- she has separation anxiety. She won't tear up any furniture or cry if you leave, but she will pee sometimes. We keep her in a crate when we leave, which she doesn't mind at all (she's crate trained). 
- she's very strong. She's a bit difficult to walk but it's doable if you're not a spaghetti noodle like me. 
- she's SUPER cuddly. She loves to lay or sit on you, especially under a blanket. Her favorite thing to do is lay on the couch cuddled up to my husband underneath a blanket. 

If you were to provide a new home for her, we will provide her crate, blankets, toys and food bowls. If you're interested, please DM me.

EDIT TO ADD: adoption fee of $50."

2. Many universities (I think) are just cancelling class and not shutting down the university, basically minimizing the amount of large congregations. Hopefully that's the case for us also. 
3. Talk to your boss ASAP. The money that student employees get paid with does not rely on revenue from the University, it's already set aside. Fight your way into still getting paid."
unt,fk0fsxb,t1_fk03r9z,1583755561.0,I second this - student apartments are usually about sold out around this time. You should only be applying in May/June if you're doing a normal apartment.

I've lived in 2 non-student apartments since then and both have been great. If you work in Flower Mound, Corinth is pretty close. I recommend Kensington Park."
