TrueFilm,fq5r7bq,t3_ggy20n,1589115205.0,"I have a lot of friends who adore films but have since gravitated to watching more TV shows. There's nothing wrong with that. 

Make no mistake, the past twenty years have given us some of the best TV shows in history. Long form storytelling just has a lot of strengths that traditional cinema simply cannot compete with.

Given the kind of shows you've been watching lately, it's hard to argue with the quality (outside of GoT for obvious reasons). That's a very hard bar to clear, but also because the TV shows you mention are some of the best in the history of the medium. And there are very few like it. 

On the flipside, I personally cannot get into TV shows unless they are literally the best of the fucking best. I can count the number of shows I've finished in a single hand, and most of them are among the ones you've already mentioned. 

I simply don't have the patience for it. I'm not going to wait until season 2 for a show to 'get good'. Nor am I going to hope that a show gets back its magic when it starts to slip by the 4th episode. 

My friends have told me that I should stop watching TV shows like films. They say I should appreciate every episode for what it is. But I can't help it. At least with a film, I'll get closure within two hours. But with a show, no way is a show gonna fuck me over after 8 seasons (except for you GoT, you scarred me). 

The magic of cinema, for me, is that it's a 1.5 to 4 hour adventure (sometimes more!) But it's always a new story, a new set of characters, and a new thing to experience (unless the movie is shit and there is nothing new). But I think the appeal of long form storytelling is that the opposite is true. 

With TV shows, especially good ones, you're not belabored with a new setup every two hours or so. You continue on this journey with characters you've already fallen in love with, in a story you've already invested in. This  especially true when every episode is rear loaded with a cliffhanger. 

Cinema requires a new investment. Every. Single. Movie. (Unlike Marvel films, which I call TV shows shown on the big screen, which is also why they're so successful). Which is why more people are binging shows than they are watching films. The emotional barrier for entry in watching a new film is much higher than watching the next episode of a TV show. 

It's neither here nor there. At the end of the day, cinema and TV are cousins in the medium of visual storytelling. I guess, I'm just trying to explain how your shift in preference isn't some strange anomaly. There are literally millions of people like you who love film, but so happen to currently prefer TV shows. 

It's definitely a mood killer to watch movies because it feels like a 'job'. And I also don't think you should force yourself to watch a film because it's a 'classic'. Going through a director's filmography just because you're a 'completionist' isn't  helpful either. The only time I go through a director's work back-to-back is because I want context (ex. How does Woody Allenâ€™s film 'Hannah and Her Sisters' compare with his film 'Interiors', when both films are about sisters?). I also take my time to lurk in this sub, read essays, write my own, watch videos, all in an effort to learn more about what I just watched. 

I'm not saying that this is what you should do, but after decades of watching films, this is how I've learned to appreciate films. I think going through a list is helpful ONLY if you have a specific goal in mind. If not, it will inevitably turn into a chore. You can start on that 100 films list, but don't feel forced to finish it. 

In the meantime, I think you should continue watching the shows you like. Watch the occassional film, and as long as you're getting any value out of it, I'd say it was worth it. 

P.S sorry for long reply lol"

All anti-fake news measures are currently being done by private companies not government. US  haven't been able to pass an anti-fake news law because it impedes freedom of speech. The closest they/we have are our libel laws (which isn't enough). 

I think both of you are on the same side. Both of you are saying that fake news is bad. But OP, which I agree with, is saying that without an (idealized) rigorous system of vetting, ""fake news"" is anything that the admin might disagree with. This is literally the approach of Trump.

To put things into perspective, I am not American. But I live in a country that has been in lockdown for just a little over a month now.

Every week, I am the one who goes out for groceries nad errands for both my household and my MIL, and every week I understand that it's another ever increasing chance of getting my family infected. My country is the hardest hit in SEA, my city even moreso. And as our deathtoll rises, our city is small enough to recognize that it's someone that is connected to us personally in someway.

That said, my intent wasn't to blame others, not only. But I refuse to take the route of helplessness while the people I care about are still healthy.
