I've suffered from chronic and acute depression with psychotic features, and been hospitalised a number of times, but I am doing much better now. When I was depressed it seemed to me that I was always depressed and had always been depressed, that my mind was inherently depressed and would always be that way.

I think my mind now is more peaceful than anything, I don't see my mind as being inherently dark or depressed the way I did before. Giving up caffeine is a good place to start improving something, try it and see how you go. Caffeine is a mind altering drug, it interferes in the natural state of the mind in ways that aren't part of the normal cultural representation of coffee as just a regular happy social and work behaviour. It's better to get rid of things like that from the equation."
AskReddit,flzyp6t,t3_exbwv5,1585638063.0,"My game changer was shifting my mindset to focus on deadlines and grades rather than my quality of work. I struggled all through my undergraduate degree with perfectionism, I wanted to obtain a profound understanding of the material and deliver an amazing piece of work. Sometimes I did but usually I'd bargain with myself over the deadline and the quality of the paper, until the deadline was past and I was losing grade points every day, it would always end up being a mess where nothing was getting done. I would often fail and need to take classes again.

In postgrad I realised I didn't care about understanding the material, I cared about getting grades. I made a commitment to always complete an answer to the question and hand it in on deadline, it didn't matter how good it was as long as it would answer the question which I knew would get me a passing grade. My professional academic friend calls it ""flinging shit at deadlines"". I got more and more efficient at determining what was in the material that was necessary to answer the question and making notes that isolated it from the rest of the material. After I made my notes I basically just threw them all into a document and restructured them to answer the question. My teachers handed out guides of the assessment criteria for the task and rather than trying to deliver a profound response, I made sure my response simply met all of the listed assessable criteria. After a while it became more fun, it was like a race to achieve what I could within the deadline. My ways of satisfying the criteria became more thorough and comprehensive, rather than more profound or deep or meaningful or groundbreaking or original or any crap like that. That's how I got to achieve high distinctions and top classes.

During undergrad I also had severe depression and couldn't concentrate. I would read the same paragraph repeatedly and nothing would go into my mind. When my depression was more resolved it was easier to concentrate."

Where it seems to me to be effective is to guide whatever specific appropriate therapeutic treatment towards recovery from some experience of disorder. No more no less. Because presumably a person who is experiencing no problem in their life, but who is contentedly going about their own version of normal, would never present for diagnosis. Blah blah blah.

Now that's enough of my delightful opinionising, caffeine is objectively a mind altering drug. Like alcohol, it is beyond culturally normalised, it is culturally saturated, so taken for granted as a normal part of life that it becomes invisible and difficult to question or argue about.

It is a wonderful experience to be free of drugs. Everything is better. For me, the worst thing about drugs including caffeine is the messed up sleep. My experience of sleep is completely different without substances. “Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care, The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, Chief nourisher in life's feast.” Shakespeare, *Macbeth*"

literature,fljgv2c,t3_fl8xbi,1585211994.0,"I'm nearing the end of ""Bleak House"" and I really relate to the Esther character. At first when I started reading the novel I thought she wouldn't be a significant character and would soon disappear, she annoyed me a lot and I wanted to see her gone, she seemed superficial to me. As I continued to read I found her more interesting and intelligent, and I realised that she is the central figure of the novel, more than Lady Dedlock.

I am conflicted about the novel. I see it as a novel intended to provoke social change and I'm admiring of it in that ambition. But sometimes it seems to go overboard as with the street children it is like, a calculatedly affecting, tear jerker type novel. I am completely OK with that too but related to that I'm most conflicted regarding Esther. Because to some extent she seems to me to be a ""perfect femininity model"" type character, Bucket even describes her as a ""pattern"". She must be a convincing character because I feel like I relate to her so well and she inspires me to have a better attitude about life. But still I feel she's maybe just a little bit ""too perfect"". Maybe it is just a mark of my own imperfections that I see her as being so perfect because I never thought Richardson's character Clarissa was too perfect like other people do.

So I should compare her to the character I really thought was too ridiculously and unrealistically perfect, Austen's Elinor Dashwood. So now I think Esther is a well formed character after all and I feel better about admiring her.

I think I relate to her more especially after she recovers from her illness and she explains something like ""That was all gone now."" Something about the way Dickens formed those phrases for her convinced me like he gave her special interior attention as a person, more than just a stock character. But I would be interested to hear if other people have opinions about the matter of Esther's ""perfect"" femininity."

I've struggled with complex psychiatric problems from late childhood and been treated as an inpatient a number of times. I've had many hours of therapy in groups or individually, psychologists, psychiatrists. (Surely and steadily doing much better now, and don't really see myself requiring therapy anymore.) Sometimes I have been more productive in therapy than others. What you wrote here reminds me of the most effective therapists I've had. They have an attitude like ""What exactly is the problem here? I need to help you resolve this issue and get you back to normal independent functioning. Because frankly, I am too busy to take your money to chat, when other people need my help!""

It gives me great consternation to see friends & acquaintances pursue indefinitely ongoing therapy for things that they should be able to do autonomously such as ""everyone needs a space to reflect"". These are people who have no discernible problem functioning in daily life who in my view, are warm and emotionally coherent, intelligent and considerate individuals, and have no need to constantly ""examine themselves"" or ""self improve"". They could be spending their time and money on experiences with their loved ones or alone doing a painting, working out in the gym, learning computer coding or a musical instrument, or anything that could be so fun and rewarding. I wish their therapist would encourage them to see themselves as competent in regulating their own emotions on a daily basis, rather than keeping them endlessly talking in therapy without any apparent goal other than continuing to talk.

I see a lot on reddit where someone is recommending therapy. Particularly in response to an OP who asks a question about something they are dealing with - what should I do, does anyone have any insights? ""Get therapy! It helps!"" It's a stock response that has achieved cultural saturation and it isn't a real genuinely thoughtful answer. OP is acting resourceful in independently searching for solutions, and they are getting told that in fact their resourcefulness is ineffective, they are incompetent to manage their life relatively autonomously and in their own community of family or friendships or other resources. Instead of looking inside themselves for something that their experience answers, people are feeling so helpless to give any meaningful help that they are outsourcing everything to therapists.

I have even seen a tremendously upvoted therapist on reddit say something like ""Don't ask communities for answers. They don't know what we know! See a therapist!"" True, but therapists don't know everything, haven't experienced everything, they don't know everything that the people in the community might know. Laypersons can be unhelpful... they can also be incredibly knowledgable and generously supportive and encouraging. It's so disturbing for me seeing the therapist express that devalidating view rather than more like ""If you've searched for answers, asked your friends, and you're still struggling with your problem, we're here for you.""

Thanks if you read all this, I don't expect you to agree with everything I wrote. I just want to say how refreshing it was to read your comment. I really value great therapy which saved my life and I'm happy to see a therapist like you express true belief in people and their knowledge, abilities, and competence to deal with life.

I read a post by someone at the smart recovery group that said that AA doesn't give a reason to stay sober. Instead, it promises that you will not be able to stay sober, you are an inherently diseased individual who will always relapse and drink. It focuses on the certainty that you will relapse rather than the certainty that you can remain sober and a reason and a plan to do that. Well of course people relapse under that kind of pressure.

AmItheAsshole,fkk88js,t3_fim7er,1584276883.0,"NTA This happened to me. My friend wanted me to play piano at her wedding. It was 6 wks away and I also was in charge of organising flowers and the photographer. I did the flowers and photographer but trying to learn something on piano was completely overwhelming and I failed. I was trying until the day before and I just couldn't do it. It was so stressful, it was not the way I ever wanted to return to music. Just say no it gives her the chance to make other arrangements."
LucidDreaming,fkjx63v,t3_fis9p2,1584263791.0,"I did this but it wasn't the exact memories, it was partial memories but they acted as a scaffolding for deeper memories of emotion. I gained a deeper knowledge of my emotions and the emotions of other people who were around me in the past. They weren't things that I had ""forgotten"" strictly speaking... they were things that I had ""forgotten about"" or overlooked or not appropriately remembered - significance of people and places to me. In a way, it was kind of better than memories replaying like perfect photography."

AmItheAsshole,fkjtwwt,t3_fim1b8,1584259489.0,"YTA. You must know that this is not an appropriate remark to make? It's very basic social behaviour to refrain from calling other people ugly. Try to see the good in people, and remember that you personally don't necessarily see ""the truth"". Remember, it's only a joke if everyone is laughing - if you're the only one laughing, you're a bully."

They aren't free to do whatever they choose just because they're religious and it's not discriminatory to prevent them from doing whatever they choose.

LucidDreaming,fkgaad5,t3_fi0nmt,1584153994.0,"Similar things have happened to me before where a loved one was in my dream and it was such a great feeling because more than anything, it gave me a powerful conviction that they are still with me.

SMARTRecovery,fkdwwzo,t3_fhp187,1584098411.0,"Awesome playlist!!!! I am definitely using this next time I find myself ruminating! A great counsellor I had taught me something similar, she says when I'm feeling something extreme that I treat it like a bus ride home, at the start of the bus ride I go really deeply into feeling the emotions and then halfway through the ride I start to come back to my surroundings, being home soon, plans of what I'm going to do with the evening, etc. She used better words in her explanation than me but I guess the idea that it is experiencing the emotion in a validating way but making it a time based thing and then coming out of the emotions. I think what you wrote is kind of similar but I love the idea of doing it with music because music is so emotional and I heard it has a dopamine effect to listen to music, I think it would be better than what my counsellor suggested."
LucidDreaming,fkdwbt5,t1_fkc11tl,1584097798.0,"I think because it's insulting to them to be told that they have no essential existence, they are just a figment, they have no soul of their own.

Dreams,fkduyyq,t3_fhuwcy,1584096269.0,"5 years is a long time. Are you ready for 5 more, or are things going to change for you?

You can transform the relationship into something else in your dreams. You can challenge the nature of the relationship through your dreams by doing things in dreams that disrupts the way the relationship plays out in the dreams, like for example, by a platonic friendship overture, or by walking away. It can start to change the nature of the relationship."
LucidDreaming,fkcaydf,t1_fkauze6,1584049298.0,"Your musical performance dreams sound wild! You should have a go at writing or playing them if you can, it's really fun and interesting. My instrument is piano, sometimes when I can't remember the melody I can still remember what I was doing physically with the keyboard. I have an app on my phone called ""Perfect Piano"" that records and I play with it on my train to work trying to reconstruct the dream. Sometimes I can remember some words or concepts of what the music was about and that helps too. I can't really think of anything in life that is as much fun for me as this... downhill skiing maybe, or walking around Venice, lol.

I agree with your remarks on the inner critic, that's all gone, it's just things naturally forming out of this primordial creative soup."

Exhaustion makes life a lot more difficult to deal with."
DecidingToBeBetter,fk70fvg,t3_fgk1u9,1583923698.0,"Procrastination seems to me to be very key to what you wrote. Do you know why you procrastinate? You could get a bit more actively critical about it. I was a huge procrastinator in the past due to perfectionism and it was a big step for me to prioritise deadlines over work quality, ie having a task completed at a particular time no matter how crap it is. My suggestion may not help you but I definitely would look into procrastination, why you (personally) do it, how to overcome it. Once you start achieving little goals it becomes kind of addictive, it gives you a bit of a high and you want more, it grows your confidence to look around yourself and gives you creative ideas about what else you can do to make life better. It's one of those times where doing stuff gives you the energy you need to do more stuff. But you really have to get started first!"

I don't think it means anything special apart from how amazing and strange the human mind and brain are. Something in there must have got switched on with the dream. It's really fascinating, it makes me wish I were a neurologist so I could research it."
