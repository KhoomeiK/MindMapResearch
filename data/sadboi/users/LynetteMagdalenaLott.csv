Even in Germany and any other country, I've been too has people driven by things that shape the EGO where they become ignorant. 

They measure values with a price instead of following a sincere path. 

Each country in all those different states has it's good and bad. 


The realities are the same even if some economic developments aren't as far as some countries are, it always begins somewhere. 

Before all those well-known countries became well-known, they haven't been developed this far as we know it today. 

They began to evolve because they did decide on a change. Change requires evolving. America was always the most powerful country the world knew about. I've come across plenty of Europeans who hate Americans. Mostly it was out of jealousy because of all the things. (I had to ask and the majority mostly answered in relation to materialism or stealing their men or women) 

Where others hate Americans I've experienced a totally different reality. 

Slightly over ten years ago, maybe about 15, I've been to a lot of clubs or bars. Surely here and there a few Americans. Mostly they have been the most respectful people I've met as well as the most self-aware. While they wanted to have a good time others started trouble to get them out of the club because they didn't have a chance with all the other females. So, they got the soldiers in trouble or started a fight so they would be thrown out. See, if some people would just respect people, in general, they would benefit from similar abundances. 

Isn't it ironic that one individual messes up the whole country is a rotten example? 

Isn't it ironic that if someone in the workplace gets out of control it's the company which is bad? 

Isn't it ironic that just because one state of a country is developed a bit further than others is blamed for being greedy? 

I could list plenty of other examples but no matter where we are in this world, NO COUNTRY IS BETTER THAN THE OTHER! 

Some will be further and some not but the ones not can decide for a change and evolve into what they want to become. 

There are so many other towns we don't know about with their own culture where they are stuck and unhappy. Therefore, they spread hate instead of changing. They always blame it on others instead of deciding on what could be possible.

It's the same with people. 

We are always one decision away to design our lives the way we want to.

It depends on the behavior you tolerate to enter your life. Plus, just because you come across Americans doesn't necessarily mean that they are originally from the United States. I've met plenty of people and for example, Africans, Russians or Polish people pretending to be American when they haven't been American because they assumed that this is the key to have a life without putting in any efforts. Even men who couldn't pick up chicks decided to pretend to be an American Soldier so they could finally land with someone. Therefore, it always depends on the intention behind a personality or characteristic pattern of an individual. What is the motive? Where are you standing in life to let others treat you horribly? How was your past experience that you tolerate misbehavior with a lack of respect? See, behaviors are universal. Meaning, mental illness, sexual abuse, mental abuse, substance abuse, physical abuse, and all other traumas are universal and exist in any country we can think about. We attract what we reflect. If you, for example, play the victim or weakened person, then most likely some people will take advantage of that opportunity for their own benefit. It's either eat or be eaten. You decide for yourself how you want to be treated. Will you tolerate furthermore that someone will mistreat you or will you let them fly out of your life and build a better environment for your own happiness? There is always a personal decision to be made. 

I wish you happy holidays üéÑ

I'm not trying to find excuses but I assume she is still pretty hurt because she never had the chance to experience a pregnancy. 

After all that you have mentioned my natural instinct would be to decide what's best for the baby, you, and your relationship.

Then search for an apartment in silence and move out ASAP until everything is secure to move in where you can feel comfortable and prepare for your family.

This would be my natural reaction because when your safety, as well as the safety of your unborn child, is at stake I'd do anything to protect all wellbeing and move forward and leave an intoxicated environment behind. 


I wish all the best for you and the baby üôèüèΩ

They intentionally cause a reaction to get the information they need. Who knows for what but the fact is that it doesn't leave enough space for those who would really need the support. 

Mostly their motive is to gain a better understanding because they have no similarities relatable to the cause of such serious illness of the mind."

mentalillness,fa8ex83,t3_e7ufce,1575845282.0,"PTSD is triggered by past traumatic events where impulse SURVIVAL is enabled by each flashback of the causing trigger. 

Let me share my story for the example to understand what I mean by that... (No Self-Promo) 

Just want to show a different perspective...

Now, let me ask you to imagine the following description.

Picture a little girl, which had so much warmth but was challenged by daily toxins. See her trying to understand love and hate, sexual abuse, mental abuse, physical abuse, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, suicide attempts, suppression, crime, advantage, disadvantage, and the difference between right and wrong.

Imagine her partly growing up in a foster system where her path became harsher.

Throughout her development, she experienced traumatic nightmares which inflicted her to be homeless in her early twenties.

Now, imagine that this little girl was me.

Yes, it did affect me throughout my entire life.

When your soul is forcefully damaged into millions of little pieces then hardly someone is able to escape such traumatizing inflicted experiences.

There was no way to go, no one to talk to, and no one to hear me.

Everyday became the silent voice of death within me. Each day I said that I don't want to be here anymore. Therefore, every substance abuse became my opportunity to harming me into death.

There was a lot going on within myself.

Specifically, when you have been told that you are worthless, you are nothing, you are dirty, and you are a prostitute as well many more toxins impacting your mental health.

Surely it was harmful enough but not the worst-case scenarios.

See, I grew up in a dead village where suppression was normality.

Therefore, negativity was my accepted reality.

I tried to become a voice but I've been forced into not having one because a voice is only for a specific ethnicity and that for my breed the minimum of existence is foreseen.

All these influences had a triggering impact on my behavioral reactions. All circumstances without processing the cause resulted in PTSD. Any song, word or violent behavior would enable a survival reaction.

Every second turned into frustration.
Every minute turned into rage.
Every hour turned into aggression.
Every day turned into a challenge that reflects anyone as the enemy.

Trust me, during such vulnerable time I had no other choice than die. That seemed more realistic to me and the best option for everyone.

I thought that if I wouldn't be here any longer, the suffering would stop but no matter what I did, I even managed to overcome death itself.

It took me several attempts to realize that I had a purpose to follow throughout my life.

Nevertheless, I was working hard for a minimum income. When I wanted to achieve more there was more resistance than expected. People tried to convince me that it was not worth it or ungrateful because no one would ever appreciate it anyways. They used any sort of manipulation strategy you could think of to get me out of the way or let's say, off their radar but after my last suicide attempt in 2013 I began to realize, that no matter how hard I try to die even by poisoning myself but still survived (which I literally did), it was clear that we are born to die but not on our own terms. We die by a prediction that is not predictable by humans. It is a much more powerful resource invisible to the blinds.

This became the turning point of my entire life.

Ever since I was a little girl, I've always been hungry for knowledge. I began at a very early age to read. Even medic books all the way to psychology even if I had no idea what numerous words have been defined as.

It came in handy throughout my new path though.

I studied the dictionary so I could understand words. I studied phrases to understand the meaning of a deeper sense. I studied synonymous to build my truth with logical sense and the most important thing I became to master was my authenticity.

While adapting the knowledge and combining it with all the experiences I had, I had the privilege to bloom into a self-mastering lesson.

Not only that but as well I finally evolved into a powerful resource for handling resistance, discriminations and much more challenging lessons throughout my personal growth.

My growth became my purpose. My purpose became my vision and my vision became my desire by supporting those throughout their personal growth with similar struggles.

Personal evolving is made for everyone and not only for a race, country or ideological believing system. It is for each unique individual searching for a leading spirit to achieve the freedom they have been hoping for.

Blogging,f9jye3f,t3_e5h34v,1575388711.0,"If you have a Facebook presence then hook them with curiosity by sharing the link on your personal page with a call to action.

Do the same but use Twitter for example with as many hashtags suitable in relation to the topic and the targeted market you are trying to reach. 

It's always good to research where your target audience is hanging out the most. 

Check who is most popular within your niche and see what is there to learn so you can optimize your skill and step your game up. 


The most important thing do:

Engage with each one as much as possible on the platform. 

Present yourself without an intended personal interest. 

I wish you all the best!

Why can't you take life anymore? 

What made you feel suicidal? 

Did you seek to discuss it openly with your family? 

I know, that you have been seeking for them to care about your impulsive intentions but some people, for example, feel forced to care by being confronted that someone is going to kill themselves. 

This is why instead of taking it seriously, they ignore it! 

Sometimes they even would comment, if you want to be dead you just do it and not announce it‚Äù

I've been there and done that... 

Never the less, if you are trying to be heard then try to speak openly of the cause and ask how they could support you. Try to engage them and tell them that you really really need them. 

If not, try to find a professional or someone specialized guiding you towards a better outlook. 

It's a tough road but you've been very strong until this day and that you have found the courage to share it with strangers shows that you are truly stronger than you think you are. 

I strongly wish and pray for you, that everything will turn out in your favor with the family üëèüèΩ

Have a lovely week!
