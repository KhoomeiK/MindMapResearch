learnmath,fpigtrq,t1_fpid9bn,1588640617.0,"Well, this is what I mean.

In programming, you have logical datas, in maths, you have logical datas too.

When you do programming, you have an idea => you convert it to a concept => you google the concept => you get a lot of programming concepts (that end up easy to understand).


When you read maths => you see a weird symbol => you check on wikipedia  => it brings you to a ton of articesl that you do not understand.


I am looking for a way to joins together two logic worlds that LOVES each others but sometimes seems to speak a different language.

Syntax in maths is beautiful and might be indeed complicated. But the _concepts_ should be the one that are hard to understand. Not the way to write them. Which is what I am trying to reach here. The way to write the concepts. The maths formulas.

>But to understand things like epidemiological models or operating systems you have to spend years learning words and syntax.

I am sincerely sorry to provoque you there(if I am). To understand one's logic : indeed, many years might be needed if the logic has not been provided.

But to understand syntax : syntax is the basic in programming (which is another way to write logic), one should not need years to understand it.
