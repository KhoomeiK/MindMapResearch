BipolarReddit,fj31t86,t1_fj2xrq0,1582963068.0,"i guess it just comes down to bipolar being a lifelong thing. prob identified bipolar symptoms 3-4ish years ago. at first i was confused because i was experiencing symptoms i didn't recognize. didn't think much when i got diagnosed. then as time went by i wasn't able to cope with it at all and still don't. every time i go to a treatment program or a new therapist they say: ""you have to want to get better"" but i don't have the desire. 

i just feel like the damage is done and irreversible. i don't know who i am anymore and i don't care anymore to find out"

bipolar,fhdi77g,t3_f2b9q8,1581487139.0,you're not overreacting at all. your feelings are valid. i would highly suggest therapy if you're not already going and finding a new psychiatrist. you need people on your side who will actually listen to you and help you. don't stop advocating for yourself!! keep going!! we believe in you
bipolar,fhdf7ld,t3_f2k4do,1581484514.0,"i've struggled with mental health since pre-school but 2 years ago i was diagnosed with bipolar 2. at first i didn't think too much of it since i was in and out of hospitalizations, but as time went on i realized that i would have to be managing this for life. i stopped going to appointments. stopped taking meds. stopped trying. stopped doing anything and everything i had to do for treating the bipolar. i am constantly in a loop of my mental health being pushed to my breaking point, seeking professional help, then stopping treatment just because i can't cope with doing this for the rest of my life.

stay on top of things, listen to yourself, and be honest. denial just hurt me in the long run. when i came across your post i thought about all the time between my diagnosis and now and i wish i could have saved my past self from the heartache. 

you got this! one day at a time."

bipolar,f5vor9g,t3_dpc04y,1572494764.0,"i had 12 treatments one summer when i was 18. at the time, i was really suicidal in an inpatient hospital. when i finished ECT, i was really happy and i got a lot better. they were finally able to discharge me because of ECT after being in the hospital for months. my first couple of sessions i couldn't really feel a difference but further into the treatment i felt happier, and lighter. the memory loss was a bitch and the muscle soreness was terrible the first couple of sessions. one of the doctors said my affect changed completely though. however, it didn't last because i fell off of treatment and medication. good luck to you!!"

BipolarReddit,eysdf5i,t3_cyft3m,1567394497.0,"i had 12 treatments inpatient. i was there for months for suicidal ideations, depression, anxiety, and undiagnosed bipolar 2. it helped me instantly, where many meds couldn’t. shortly after the treatments i was cleared to be discharged (would not have happened without it). the only downside is that i have no recollection of that time period. after the first treatment i couldn’t remember a single thing that happened that day"
BPD,ewqi4sk,t3_cplnze,1565666634.0,a couple years ago i moved out of town to go start college and went by a nickname instead of my name. i only became self aware that i was trying to start over when one of my old friends said that my nickname served as my alter ego. i constantly entertain the idea of starting over too.
