With Cardio, I can suggest plausible explanations. At the end, the rely on stats to come to the conclusions.

Sometimes as my second-mouse for the buttons I used this [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kensington-Orbit-Trackball-ergonomic-ambidextrous/dp/B000HEW0KW](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Kensington-Orbit-Trackball-ergonomic-ambidextrous/dp/B000HEW0KW). It basically has large button that I could use with the other hand, while using the first hand to steer the mouse. Might be worth considering. 

So the vim plugin is actually a browser plugin. I know that firefox and chrome have vim plugins but they are slightly different (different buttons do different things). I know it is a cliche thing to say, but your work should value you and your health much more than installing a plugin or extra software. 

So a lot of RSI are quite poorly characterised in terms of what is actually happening. We define them by their symptoms and we do not necessarily understand the cause (which might not be there, it could be combinatorics of different factors). One of the major symptoms is the chronic inflammation which is known to be a bad signal for most things. So the steroidal injections removes the inflammation. Ibuprofen might be for this reason better than paracetamol because it also reduces inflammation. Aspirin is much weaker (I switch between it and ibuprofen). 

I have not tried surgery because I learnt how to manage it and I never felt like getting rid of my savings by disabling my hands for months, which I need to work. I don't really have a good reason. It is not as bad nowadays so I should not need a surgery. If at any point it goes downhill, I might consider it. 

I believe more in sport. I think it has little to do with muscles often. Grip strength is surely important if it is an issue, so for that reason it it good to have it in mind. I would do cardio more. There is the most evidence that good cardio helps than anything really. I am thinking about looking up these things and share them on this subgroup. Sounds like a good thing. 

The worst thing is anxiety and stress nowadays. I am not sure if I'd develop it (at all? to the same extent?) if my hands did not have these issues. Depression and other mental problems due to chronic illnesses and disabilities is a regular phenomena."

Is it the aiming or pressing the buttons that aggravates your condition? I used to switch my hand and used left hand one day and right hand another day. I also used a mouse that is vertical (and it sucks to use it but at the time it was perfectly helping).

I further used application to avoid using mouse in general. I have basically the whole linux environment that allows me to rarely use mouse. 

For example, in the case of a browser, I use a vim plugin. This means that I can press hyper-links without using my mouse. 

I also remember in one review that stress is a factor. I can't tell you what helped exactly, because I have reoriented my life around it, and tried to many things. Was it the tread mill I had? Was it the sport I did all the time?

I am at the point where I am also more happy and slightly less stressed. And that apparently is a factor too. Stress in general - which incrases inflammation - which is the ""source"" of the issue in hands. I am also taking a bit of aspirin and ibuprofen pills (and occasionally use the topical cream). They are anti-inflammatory which means they might be addressing the source of the issue. Prolonged inflammation affects negatively the cellular environment.

RSI,f59fjie,t1_f56opge,1572087250.0,"I am sorry to hear that. I hope it is going to go away. I remember reading some stats and it says that most RSI resolve themselves in 7 years (with most of these being in the first year or two). So hopefully it is not going to be longer. 

I was in a similar position around 7 years ago. I finished back then my thesis and started having my RSI and started a full time job that made it worse. So I was not on the lucky side. Luckily my employer back then was somehow supportive. I still have it but I manage it better nowadays. Occasionally it comes back - and then it is a real downer. It led ultimately to psychological issues (I'd like to believe) but it is not all bad. Management and enough really helped.

If you have carpel tunnel syndrome, then you would be in the group that surgery is the best way to go.

But you mention that you have pain in your pinkie and ring finger so that implies that you have an issue with your ulnar nerve only, which is not carpal tunnel syndrome. If you look up ulnar nerve you will see the division, here is a[https://m8malone.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ulnar-nerve.jpg](https://m8malone.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/ulnar-nerve.jpg)

RSI,f502sap,t3_dm2a28,1571920830.0,"Make sure you do not aggravate your condition. With my hands, I noted that I get pains if I put pressure on my hands in a certain direction. The opposite direction is fine. I can't have my hand pushed in my direction (e.g. benching). But pulling my hands away is fine (e.g. climbing). However, others have is different. 

Also, you should remember that most of the evidence for RSI and sport comes from cardiovascular health. I have not seen any actual trials showing that particular muscle building resolves the issue. It's a condition related to inflammation, and I can't see how muscles exactly resolve this. 

If others see any papers / evidence, please share.
