TeenageSuicideWatch,fkyjl2m,t1_fkxsmxe,1584650017.0,Thanks for replying to my comment and I appreciate the advise but it was all just a rant to get things out of my system. But it’s nice to hear that about the sexuality thing because I guess it’s so difficult nowadays when everyone is supposed to fit into a label and I just can’t seem to find one.
BPD,fkwyhji,t3_fgh8zj,1584611495.0,"Fuck. I was questioning whether I had BPD or not cause I read it somewhere and I though hey that sounds pretty accurate . I’m going on reddit to check more out. And I thought to myself, honestly, “why are you doing this? There is nothing wrong with you stop pretending there is, you are just a little insecure, shut up.”. And then I saw this post and started reading.... halfway through I burst into tears and realised. Fucking finally. Ever since I was little I’ve always been labelled as overdramatic and my mum always got so mad when I wouldn’t concentrate on her (or anything). Even after I grew older and stopped supposed to be having tantrums I would continuously get over emotional about the smallest things like going on a walk with my mum. I don’t think she’s realised that somethings wrong with me or if she does know she’s in denial. I’ve spent my free time obsessively researching any and all personality disorders, since I’ve realised this isn’t how other people think so thank you. thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you . THANK YOU. I cant believe I’m saying this but glad other people go through the same shit as me ( although I don’t wish this upon ANYONE)."
