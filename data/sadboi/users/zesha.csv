It’s also admirable that you want to help. I know many of my friends became exhausted trying to deal with me, especially whoever was my Favorite Person (FP) at the time. That was back when I had no idea what BPD was and just thought I had depression. I do feel better after going through DBT, though I still have times I slip back into old thought patterns. 

My friend that I met in DBT actually recently suggested someone by the name of [Dr. Daniel Fox](https://www.youtube.com/user/lcruz71)  on YouTube. I’ve only watched one video so far, but I did like his analogy of the “stray cat of depression.” Actually, perhaps that’s how you can get her interested in the idea! There’s a lot of videos online regarding BPD. I think the creator of DBT, Marsha Linehan, has some videos you can find on YouTube as well. 

One thing I will caution: don’t go too far down the rabbit hole in a single day. I did that when I first was diagnosed with BPD because I was terrified. I learned about it from my case manager. I hadn’t even known I had been diagnosed with it, and my case manager has so little empathy I couldn’t trust her to ask questions. It’s easy to read or watch too much, so take breaks when you need to. Don’t sit there for hours reading and end up with a nasty headache like I did, lol"

I hadn’t even really heard of it at that point, and I wouldn’t be officially diagnosed with it for another two years. It wasn’t easy, but DBT was very helpful. Even for those that don’t have a personality disorder, I think it would be useful. It may even help you cope with how she’s acting.

LockedAway,fnqh5o4,t3_g2uv5s,1587164512.0,">I was finally referred to Patricia because it was deemed that I need meds and only a psychiatrist can do that. 

Well, that answers some of my questions from the last post you made...

Psychiatrists are not the best at relating, at least in my experience. They're good for giving you medications and if you have complications, either finding something to help keep the problems at bay or finding something new. But they aren't trained in the same way a therapist is. They have a bit of training, but as my newest psychiatrist has admitted, they're prepped for the medical side of things more than for the emotional side of things. 

This does explain her choice of tactics for trying to get you to talk. If I've read your post correctly, she's already tried the silent staring, which is supposed to make you uncomfortable so you'll just start word vomiting. She may be able to give you some guidance, but a therapist would be much better able to give you information on coping skills and other techniques to keep you afloat.

I do get where she's coming from trying to get you to try meds. They can help. But as you've said, you have to keep food on the table and you don't really have the time to adjust to a new medication. So if she can just, y'know, try to help without shoving meds down your throat, that'll be great.

The brother was worried about his missing sister, then a month later I think he was summoned by the demon lord to fight the hero and his companions. The hero interferes with the summoning and kills him while being formed. The demon lord took his soul and fled, resurrecting him in a dead body as a death knight I think?

AskReddit,ffmu6fr,t3_etywzw,1580058947.0,"I had an argument with my then-boyfriend and it got really heated. He had been talking a lot with another girl and was distancing himself from me, and I said he was doing it to hurt me. Long story short, I cut my arm pretty bad and then went out to a parking lot and downed as much of the Trazadone I had that I could stomach. My bf refused to call an ambulance but he gave my address to my friend in NY that I had been texting goodbye to, and she called them. They gave me activated charcoal, sent someone sort of mental health evaluator guy in to see me, and kept me about 5-6 hours. I left with a $5,000 hospital bill. 

I attempted two more times that year and it was generally the same. Arguments would happen or I’d get really down and instead of doing anything to stop it, I’d feed into my thoughts and plan until that evening, then attempt it. Years later it turns out that on top of major depression I also have borderline personality disorder, and looking back it’s easy to see where the two intermingled and caused chaos. Couple that with the fact the bf I had at the time was verbally abusive and it just really paints how much of a mess it all was.

As of today, my depression and BPD are managed decently most of the time and I have a loving and supportive boyfriend. Things aren’t 100%, but it’s nice to not be thinking of how to kill my self constantly."

I personally know of one that managed to get into social work… and hated it.  As much as she wanted to help, it became too much too quick and she burnt out in less than a month of starting. 

I’ve also come to notice that, when I get a glimpse at my case worker’s notes, she seems to have… either embellished it with lies or she’s just projecting whatever she wants to onto me and writing it down. I think perhaps that may be another reason for being nervous to cut services. As for why I’m seeing her in the first place, that’s because my psychiatrist stuck her nose where it didn’t belong and demanded I be set up with one. It is the biggest waste of time. My case manager doesn’t actually *do* anything, aside from expect me to have appointments with her every month. Well, she says every month, but a lot of times she pencils herself in right before my other appointments and doesn’t tell me. I personally find her to be a nuisance. 

>I'm a large man who generally rocks a borderline homeless look, and I still get people who do that out of nowhere, including once in the middle of a convenience store while I was waiting to get a drink. 

It’s crazy that looks don’t seem to matter. I could probably dress up like that doll Chucky and people would still do it. I don’t quite understand how people just have a sense that some random person on the street won’t lure them into a back alley and murder them. I’m ok with it every once in a while, I’ll talk with people so they can get it off their chest… but I’m truly not interested in hearing how much a person hates their sister, their sister who pays for a roof over their head and asks only that the house be kept decently clean. I could just be opinionated though. *(shrug)*

> So many people say they want to understand or want to get better or want to whatever...but they kick, scream, and drag their feet on doing the actual work required to do those things or to make better decisions for themselves. 

Mm, yes, literally 90% of the people I’ve met. I still fall into this trap sometimes. I’ll feel so incredibly drained and not want to deal with it, but I won’t be to the point where I physically cannot do anything. Eventually you either get sick of things and start making changes or you embrace the melancholy and turn into a person like my mother, who does nothing but sit around drinking all day. Doesn’t do laundry, doesn’t cook, just drinks, smokes cigarettes, and calls people on the phone to whine about a past that doesn’t even affect her anymore. I eventually had to cut her from my life though. Every time she’d talk about my dad, she made it out to be my fault. I had enough on my shoulders at 15, I still have enough on them now, so I don’t need someone to try to make me feel like someone else’s death is my fault.

> And then you get into the question of whether or not people can actually understand or not. 

People always say they understand, but many don’t. For instance, I’ve been uncomfortable in a situation before and tried to leave and been physically restrained by an ex-boyfriend to make me stay in it. I’ve also very stupidly been convinced to go to a bar and allowed someone else to drive, so when my anxiety whacked me upside the head two hours in, I just got an, “I understand,” as she continued to sit at the bar. I say no to that person all the time now when asked to go anywhere, and she always calls me lame or says, “Fail.” What a lovely, understanding friend.

> The biggest mental health upgrade I had for my life was just allowing myself to feel my feelings. 

And probably the hardest. I feel a lot of anger and that’s something my family has always taught needs to be stuffed down because it’s not proper to show anger. I’m still trying to get myself to let it boil over. I’ll feel it get close and then it’ll die off because the intensity scares me. I’d like it to actually get to a point where I can release it. 

> People could do a lot more with the mental health field right now if they would realize that those professionals don't fix us. They're just a tool for us to fix ourselves with, no different than picking up a hammer to drive a nail. All the help and therapy in the world won't help someone if they won't put in the work. But there's always room for improvement. 

Ha, but you know as well as I do that professionals and those they treat view it the same. That the professional is going to fix everything. They can’t, though. They can’t see exactly what’s going on in our heads. They can give us resources, tools, but they can’t be a surgeon and open up our heads and fix it that way. There are a lot of people that want a quick fix. Mental health, though, is a lifelong pursuit."
SuicideBereavement,f5vju42,t1_f5so58g,1572491117.0,"
I had a counselor once that told me probably a bit too much about her life. Sometimes it was nice to know that yes, she was an actual person with feelings, troubles, same crap as me. Other times I felt like the session was more about her. I had a different therapist admit to me once that she herself had a therapist, because, like you said, burnout is a real problem. If I could go back, I’d probably pose the question: then why don’t we just teach people healthy ways to deal with their emotions? Like honestly, we could at least throw those DBT videos from Marsha Linehan up as part of health class. It’s better than what we have now. 

Back on topic though, I’m always afraid of running into the people I’ve transferred from. Truth of it is I see them all the time and we don’t acknowledge each other. At all. So I’m not sure why I’m so scared of this case manager of all people. Though, to be honest, case management has never actually done much. She’s my second case manager in 7 years. And I kind of only have her because my psychiatrist made a big deal out of me getting one. Truly, I just want to stop seeing her. It’s such a waste of my time. 

> Relapses, overdoses, suicides, watching people suffer on a daily basis, having those same people lie to you regularly.

Now you just sound like you’re describing my coworkers, minus the suicide. But we work retail. I burn out a lot from coworkers telling me their problems because they just can’t seem to grasp I’m not a therapist. Customers do the same. I am a magnet for people to tell their misfortune. I’d rather be the opposite and repel people but I haven’t gotten that “resting bitch face” thing down. 

I have noticed that I’ve had to sit down and explain Bipolar vs. Borderline to people—and sometimes that Bipolar isn’t one size fits all. My boss has it but he mostly hits mania before falling into depression and then being ok for another year or so. Or that’s how it was explained to me. Trying to explain to people that don’t have a mental illness tends to prove... challenging. “But isn’t it all the same?” If only. 

After multiple times of trying to get family to understand my illness and then just... not understanding or freaking out over me being upset, I’ve become more comfortable telling internet strangers and friends that live more than 100 miles from me because hey, whoever is able to understand at this point. I wish it were the case that family and nearby friends understood, but... they don’t. For instance, one day I was basically overloaded with emotions and from being around too many people, and my uncle told me to suck it up and go see my aunt in the hospital. She had a stroke and couldn’t talk or walk. I get she had more problems at that moment but what if that had been the day I had enough? The day I just... went missing for a week? I don’t think I’d have done anything drastic, but if pushed I may consider living in my car for a week as far away as I can drive. I don’t have the money for it... buuuut desperation.

> I regularly hear people say that you shouldn't compare yourself to other people. But in my case I had to, because I had been mentally ill for so long, since I was a child, that I didn't understand what emotionally healthy and happy even looked like anymore.

Exactly. When some of your earliest memories involve having a mental illness, you’ve got to look for someone who has some sort of base that is healthy. Now no one in my family has that, even the ones that are supposedly “normal” as they like to call themselves. So like you, I’m going to have to see an outside perspective to become a person I want to be. Otherwise I’ll be like everyone else in my family, trying to hide the fact that someone’s daughter is physically abusing her husband. (They want a family reunion this year. If they’re smart they won’t invite me.)

I feel like the only reason I’d look back at an outline personally would be if I got stuck, to try to figure out what’s holding me up and get around it. I don’t want to cling to the past like I used to. There are still parts I’m not over, things that happened to me that I have to work through, but I’m not clinging to things from like 20 years ago. The amount of pessimism I had for the world back then.. not all that appealing to my current self. 

I’ve made plenty of bad choices while unwell. Despite that I hold out some hope for the world, but it’s like what you said—realism backs it. We could do a lot with the mental health field and people could recover if given the right tools. For now it’s still mostly being in the right place at the right time, but I mean... the field has gotten better since I started seeing therapists 15 years ago. Maybe in another 15 years they’ll tweak it a bit more. I certainly hope they do. 

I like the way you put that. Too many battles to face in the present and future to keep fighting one that’s long been over. It’s good not to forget the past, but you can’t relive what’s already happened and change it."
SuicideBereavement,f5rf6sn,t1_f5r4a2j,1572393370.0,"Really? That’s a shame. I was just given a case manager and she was the one that tod me. “You’re aware of your diagnoses, correct? Major Depressive Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder?” I wasn’t entirely surprised because I had someone tell me before that I exhibited signs of BPD, but the way she said it—as if she had no emotion to her whatsoever—just made it hit a little harder. I spent a good two weeks waiting to see my therapist and during that time I did actually go a little crazy trying to cope with the knowledge. My case manager has not found any empathy even seven months later. Personally I’d like to be rid of her but she was pushing to have me hospitalized not long ago so now I’m terrified to be like, “Look, you’ve done nothing but make my life worse.”

No, writing never seems to be able to fully capture how emotions make us feel. It’s close, but until we can implant our feelings into others with simulators that are probably still a couple decades away, it’ll never be 100%. Thing is I did see where they were coming from with the BPD diagnosis. I just felt betrayed that no one had ever told me, and this callus woman that doesn’t know me and is showing 0 emotional support of any kind was the one that let it slip as if it were just common knowledge. It did not help that I could see the screen she was writing on and she kept typing “bipolar disorder” instead. She noticed I kept looking and insisted that she’d fix any mistakes before she submitted it, but y’know. What annoyed me was that they’re two different illnesses and I didn’t want a third to pop up on my record. 

Family seems to be the most against the whole medication thing. Actually I’ve noticed my own family freaks out over little things, which is why I think my dad never mentioned his suicidal thoughts. My grandma knew he had depression (I did not, though after the fact it was fairly obvious) but I know from experience that she is not the one to talk to about suicidal thoughts. My first attempt ended with her yelling at me that I had nothing to be depressed about. Naturally, I attempted two more times after that. I avoid telling my family a lot of things because they can’t handle it.

Ah, good old Maslow. It’s been a while since I’ve heard that name. That’s actually a great idea to use to help outline things. Actually, this site breaks down the hierarchy really nicely. Thank you for this resource!

That’s not an experience I’ve ever had regarding a crush, though I’ve definitely had the blank book moment with other things. I’ve gotten lucky and never had it happen with a customer. I get called stupid enough. 

Today has been long and exhausting, but I’m going to try to start outlining the things that I feel are stopping me from living a more fulfilling life. As many times as I fall down the rabbit hole of depression, I need something to keep me grounded. Have you ever looked back at your outline and seen all the progress you’ve made since you first wrote it?"
SuicideBereavement,f5r9ljg,t3_doiyze,1572390537.0,"I think the politest way to go about it is very quickly but calmly say, “I thank you for your condolences, but I do not wish to discuss this further, especially at work.” If they try to hug you, say something like, “I appreciate the gesture but it brings on too many emotions. Please refrain from touching me for now.”

I don’t know about you, but being hugged when I’m upset usually makes me more upset. There are very rare times I want to be touched. When my own father died I didn’t want to be touched at all and I didn’t want to talk about it. It’s how some of us cope. Coworkers or not, they need to respect that you have to grieve in your own way.

If you still feel you need to allow them to do something, perhaps you could try to mention a card or perhaps some of your favorite candy would be a good substitute if they really want to help in your process. You never have to read the card if you don’t want to. You can give away the candy. The sentiment is nice but... you don’t really know them, they don’t really know you, and from the way you’ve typed it they definitely don’t know your dad. Perhaps even by telling them not to touch you or talk about it they will feel relieved they don’t have to bring it up. 

Or if anything good is about to happen, deflect it. My dad died a week before my birthday. I didn’t come back until my birthday and whenever anyone asked, I’d tell them and the moment they started to say, “I’m so sorry,” I’d respond, “Don’t be, it’s my birthday.” Still not entirely sure how that worked but most of the students didn’t say much else about it.

I had never seen so many people get so triggered over me looking into what something was! I lost count of how many friends said I had become obsessed with BPD. In reality, I just wanted to know what to expect. My current psychiatrist, a different one from the one who diagnosed me, insists she doesn’t see it in me though so *(shrug)*.

Part of me would like to ask my boyfriend if it bothers him that I mention my dad sometimes, but I’m going to wait a day or two. Today is his last day of 5 days working in a row. The job he works at stresses him a lot, plus I’d rather ask when he would be more receptive to talking about it rather than taking a nap.

An outline, hm? If you don’t mind me asking, what was an example from it? The first thing that comes to my mind is my lack of assertiveness and difficulty saying no, so I spend far more time being annoyed with people when if I had just told them right out that no, I didn’t want to do X, Y, or Z for whatever reason, things would have gone smoother. I’m sure there’s plenty more though. That’s something I’ll have to think about.

Im glad to hear that it’s helped, though! Many people don’t really sit down and focus on what’s making their lives less than they want them to be. Doesn’t mean it’s easy, but I’d like to believe it’s worth it.

It doesn’t hurt *as much* anymore. I’d still prefer it if he were around. But I never really felt angry at him.

I can attest to that since about 4 years later I was hospitalized. A single look at my records showed my father’s suicide and that’s all anyone wanted to talk about: how I hadn’t gotten over it. One nurse even asked me how old he was when he died (47) and then proceeded to say people lie about their ages all the time. Thing is... I had no clue how old he was when he was alive. I did the math after to figure that out. 

I’ve seen a lot of different people that don’t understand grief or think they do. I still miss him deeply. I’d still love to hug him again. I’d still punch the next person that tells me he went to hell, should anyone decide to be that stupid again. I feel most of my problem is that I’ve become confused as to what closure looks like. 

I don’t really know what the difference between a grief counselor and a regular therapist is, but I may bring it up with my therapist when I see her tomorrow."

depression_help,f583sao,t3_dn4apw,1572048155.0,"Over the last two years I’ve stumbled upon several trails. I love exploring them and if they look any good, I’ll bring my boyfriend with me the next time we have a day off together. The last time we went trail walking we spotted two white tailed doe, sat by a river watching a boating team practice, and found out what the underside of a raised highway looks like (there’s a lot of graffiti, some of it even well done.)

Despite how bad my depression has been lately, and despite how often I go down the rabbit hole and forget these memories, when I do remember I still enjoy those memories. My boyfriend likes to push me farther than I thought I could go, and I’ve been down forks in trails I had never gone down on my own and made it through an entire loop (1.5 miles or so) because he wouldn’t let me turn around. I never regret it. My feet do, but they get over it. 

I would highly recommend parks and trails to anyone. If you can find someone to go with you, even better. I love being out there alone but the memories that being with another person makes just... it gives the place something special.

Good on your fiancé for doing this. It’s easy to overlook just getting lost in nature when your own brain is your worst enemy."
SuicideWatch,f4vdzow,t3_dly1a8,1571840975.0,"Everything in a therapy session is meant to be confidential unless they believe you are a threat to yourself or others. As another user already said, thoughts do not always equal intent. But suicidal thoughts are generally commonplace with a mental illness. If they hospitalized everyone that said, “I’m having suicidal thoughts,” the psychiatric wards wouldn’t have the capacity for them all.

If you’re concerned that your parents would become... less than bearable if they knew, you may wish to bring that up with your therapist. It’s normal for a parent to worry if their child is suicidal but if they start with the, “You have nothing to be depressed about, others have it worse, *I* have it worse,” that won’t be helpful to you. Therapists see those reactions a lot, so if you ever do decide to tell your parents, ask your therapist for a good way to break it to them or have them in the room with you and your therapist. 

Short answer: Yes, you can tell your therapist without them running off to tell your parents. Doing so would break HIPAA. Unless you say they can give information to your parents, the only thing they will ever know is what you tell them."

overcoming,f1vvii3,t3_dauhyq,1569776492.0,"This reminds me a lot of how things were for me when I was put on Cymbalta. I had just come off 200mg of Zoloft (after around 150mg it stopped working and it was just side effect after side effect) and my psychiatrist put me on 20mg of Cymbalta. Within a week I noticed I wasn't myself, and it was causing panic attacks the likes of which I had never dealt with in my life. I told my psychiatrist but she insisted I just needed to increase the dose to 40mg. Turns out I did not need to increase the dose, Cymbalta was literally making me worse. I quit taking it and had to go to urgent care to get something for the panic attacks, because my psychiatrist was literally unreachable. 

Stay vigilant. Keep track of your symptoms. Take a list if you have to, because psychiatrists don't like changing medication if they think it's working. That can become incredibly frustrating.

I hope that things keep getting better for you, and I'm glad it seems you have a wife that really loves and cares about you. Perhaps get her to help you keep track of any changes in your mood or personality, that way you can bring them up. Like I said, if they think it's still working and you're just having a ""minor side effect"" they likely won't do anything besides increase the dose."
overcoming,f1k3vp3,t3_d9hwt0,1569531452.0,"Yes, whether it be because it took all the energy I had to go out or because I realize now I have to go back to living life. 

But there’s tons of different reasons for it, and seems to depend a lot on the person and context. For instance, I saw one of my high school friends for the first time since graduation (roughly 7 years) and after the night was over I was sad because I do really enjoy her being around. On the other hand, sometimes I hang out with people and I have an amazing time, but when I get home my mind immediately starts pointing out things I “did wrong” to bring me back to “normal.”

So it’ll depend on the situation for what you do to not feel as bad. I personally do a lot of distracting through videos, games, reading, and occasionally drawing."
overcoming,f1g5uag,t1_f1g0dhn,1569460576.0,"Sadly it really has gotten common. Most of my friends live with family because it’s just not affordable to live on their own—or their physical/mental health has caused them trouble. I do hope you’ll be able to go back to work in the near future to a place that isn’t a drain on your sanity. 

I know a lot of people with anger issues kind of just get ignored until things get severely out of hand. It’s something I don’t understand.  I’ve seen it in “normal” kids I went to school with too. Bunch of pent up frustration and anger, no idea how to manage it in a healthy way... one kid broke a teacher’s arm. There have been chairs thrown in the cafeteria. And that’s barring the pistol they found in a kid’s backpack. If he hadn’t been acting odd and the teacher hadn’t noticed, a lot of people could have ended up dead. The kid got bullied a lot and I guess it got to a breaking point for him. Unfortunately I have no idea what happened after that. There was a brief mention of counseling, but I never saw him again. 

Life sucks a lot. I get that. But I find it irresponsible to let someone who has a history of aggression, whether they have a disability or not, just... be brushed off like nothing happened. Another example: my brother is somewhere on the autism spectrum. He gets angry easily. One day our mom tried to tell him to turn off the tv and go to bed and he wouldn’t, so she turned it off. He body slammed her. She only weighs like 90lbs as opposed to his 170lbs or so. I think he had to have held back, but even since that event she refuses to get him therapy and says, “He’d never hurt me.” Even though he did and I’m not sure how she survived it."
depressionregimens,f17cv0s,t1_f16y8vx,1569240827.0,"I see, that is a difficult place to be. Since you’re on your dad’s insurance I’d say try to appeal to him. Describe how talk therapy really doesn’t feel helpful to you. Express how it feels like a waste of time and money when there are others who need therapy.

There was a point when I was in a DBT group. Some of it was helpful, most of it was listening to a select few people talk about their lives. The one skill I remember best is called DEAR MAN. [Take a look](https://www.mindfulnessmuse.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy/using-d-e-a-r-m-a-n-to-get-what-you-want) if you want. Whatever ends up happening, I wish you the best"
depressionregimens,f16c9i6,t3_d7y00j,1569208204.0,"You don’t have to be cooperative. You can tell them, “I don’t want to talk to you.” You can tell them you think it’s pointless, or that you hate it. Or... you can say nothing at all. You can sit there and just stare at them silently. (A few psychiatrists I’ve seen use that to make people uncomfortable enough to open up. It’s pretty creepy.)

I hated therapy for a long time. It didn’t feel like it helped and trusting therapists, or anyone, was difficult. It took until last year before I could finally open up to a therapist fully, and I’ve been in and out of therapy for 15 years now. 

If I had to hazard a guess though, your parents are pressing for you to go because they’re scared. A lot of people don’t understand depression. It’s something they struggle to comprehend, which just makes things more frustrating. It might not be a bad idea for your parents to see a therapist, actually. Help them process and learn about depression. 

Otherwise just doodle or read or whatever in session. They can’t make you say anything. I’m not sure about your age, but when I was released from hospitalization and had to see a therapist, after a while I just stopped showing up. I was my own transportation and scheduled my own appointments so I’d just cancel them or not show up. Eventually they took me off her list of clients."
IsItBullshit,ezfccdf,t1_ezez0t3,1567875889.0,"I can’t really speak for countries outside the US, but I’ve been on several different SSRIs and SNRIs over the last 10 years and none of them have affected my ability to drive and the only person I’ve ever known to come close to “banned” from driving had let their license expire not long after they had gotten out of the hospital for a suicide attempt. They were still allowed to drive, they just had to see a psychiatrist every month or two. 

Like a lot of others have said though, it’s unlikely your employer can get a copy of your medical record. If you don’t want them to know anything about your mental health, don’t tell them."

Reheating food reminds me of the meal preps I see every now and then, which might also be a good thing for them. Give them something to eat without having to really do much, and if they aren't hungry right away just put it away for later.

I didn't know that lung cancer tended to spread to the brain like that. I'm hoping that if nothing else, they can do something to reduce the symptoms."
