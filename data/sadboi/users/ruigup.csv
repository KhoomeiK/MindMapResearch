depression,f8xn7gd,t1_f8xmr2f,1574924876.0,"Thank you. 
I think I've already told them a couple months ago or so. It's not that they're not supportive or anything. I just don't like putting the burden of information to someone I love and care about because I think it would already be too much for them to handle. I feel the same with my friends. I only have a quality set but I don't want to burden them with that anymore.
Self-help books, I've never really considered, so maybe I'll give that a try.
I also believe in time therapy. I also believe that within time, there are a set of things I myself have to do as well in order for it to work.
Maybe waiting helps but maybe it won't if all I do is wait. 
Okay, so there's a lot going on in my mind now and I'm afraid it won't make sense anymore.
But what I'm trying to say is I agree with all that you said.
I'll look into self-help books. 
I really appreciate your time. 
Thank you."

ladycyclists,f7jzcu4,t1_f7izaka,1573790378.0,"It is a fixed gear bike indeed. I have to admit, I enjoyed riding it when I was living in the city where the roads were better and flat. Where we live now, it's hilly. I wouldn't mind it if I was as active as I was before, but I feel I need to get back softly to riding first before going out there again. I do have trainers here. I'm setting it up so I can use it in the morning before I work (or maybe WHILE I'm working?) and then maybe when partner doesn't have work, we can ride together again. 
There's a nearby province (around 60kms one way) we used to go to and I'm aiming to go back there again soon.
I'm not entirely sure about the safety of this place as I haven't really explored it yet. 
I will let you ladies know what happens."

Nung elem days ko lalo, pag vacant time sa school, patintero or agawan-base with classmates tapos taguan naman kasama mga kapitbahay sa hapon. 

Siguro kanya kanya lang talaga ng pagpapalaki ng mga bata yan. Kung tutuusin, may mga bata nga din nung 90's na lumaki sa sega at family computer, pero nakakalaro mo pa rin sa labas paminsan minsan."

Talaga bang kasama na sa curriculum ng MAPE yung Filipino street games? May narinig lang akong dalawang high school students dati nagkukuwentuhan na parang kasama yata sa practical exam nila yung patintero. I was like, ""talaga ba?"""
ladycyclists,f7ghpvr,t1_f7gh4p0,1573704199.0,"It's crazy. When we moved, I felt like a fish that was taken out of the river and dropped in a tank. I didn't know anyone and don't know any places, plus it's far from where we used to live so it's kind of suffocating. I still feel the same now. 

You're right, though. I should just get on it and go wherever. I appreciate your time on this. Thank you! And be careful while you're driving. It must be very cold there. Keep warm!"
ladycyclists,f7gh75j,t1_f7fvii5,1573703767.0,"Tell you the truth, before we moved here, I went riding at the neighborhood spot where we used to hang out. The guys I used to ride with saw me and noticed how much weight I've gained and pointed that out to me. I never thought it would bother me so much. I wasn't used to that kind of comment. 

But I guess us moving here in this new, middle of nowhere place did give me some sort of advantage since no one here knows me and no one can make that kind of remark to me. Damn, I never saw that angle until now. Geez.

You're right. My weight shouldn't hold me back. They don't know me. No one would care. I can do this!

Thank you so very much!"
ladycyclists,f7ggqpm,t1_f7fcvo3,1573703392.0,"I wish I could find like-minded ladies here, but it's just me and the neighborhood grannies. Haha! 

I'm not sure what you call this place sandwiched between the city and the province, but yeah, there's not much cyclists here. I should really go out more.

Thank you for your time answering!"
ladycyclists,f7ggkeu,t1_f7fj9cq,1573703246.0,"I agree. I'm not a people person, but oddly, I like it better when I ride with other people. I used to go on long rides with the neighborhood cyclists, but since we moved, there's no one else to go with anymore. My partner still does ride his (bike messenger) so I'm left on my own. 

I wish we had that no-drop cycling group here, too. Maybe I should start one in the future? Lol! Thank you ever so much!"
ladycyclists,f7gg9dp,t1_f7f8a4p,1573703000.0,"Thanks for the motivation! I'm in an area where it's less than pleasant to ride on and there's really nothing to see (we moved here beginning of the year) but I guess I could use that as a challenge or just not think about it anymore.

I used to do that before, too. Ride everywhere I need to be, except going to work because it was a 15km ride one way and the roads here are hell for cyclists. 

To me, it was more like I just wanted to be somewhere else so I could stay as far away as I possibly can on two wheels. The exercise is secondary. 

Good luck on your next race!"
ladycyclists,f7gfk3k,t1_f7eyq5x,1573702446.0,"That sounds like a piece of good advice, the ""be a dog on a ride"". I'll think of this when I ride.

Indeed, I get to think about riding more when I'm out doing something else. Like, when I'm walking to the store I think ""I should've ridden my bike instead"". I'll try that, too.

Thank you so much!"

Thank you for reminding me about it!"
ladycyclists,f7geyco,t1_f7f5hqg,1573701985.0,"It's a sad, desolate place out here where we live now. We live in the borderlines of the city where it's almost the province but not quite. I do get to see the swimming carabaos near the sports complex once in a while if I'm lucky. But besides that, there's really nothing to see here.

I'll go exploring nearby places and provinces when the time comes. Thanks for the tip!"
ladycyclists,f7gek2m,t1_f7f5a90,1573701679.0,"It gets overwhelming, really. That's why I stopped making new years resolutions eons ago.

I work at home and haven't really explored this new place we live in now. You could say we live in between the city and the province but there's not much sight to see here (at least that's what I'm told) and the terrain isn't all that good. 

Wow, that's a lot of excuses. Sometimes, I literally talk to my bike (name's Chicken because it's a Cheeko lol not funny) and say sorry to it because it's been gathering dust for so long. Sigh...

Writing this comment now made me realize how much BS I tell myself that it took so much of the time I could've spent riding. I wanted flats when we live in an uphill town. Cycling clothes don't fit anymore. Bla bla bla.

You're right. I should just get on with it heading nowhere. 

Thank you."
ladycyclists,f7gdlnm,t1_f7f0cyc,1573700969.0,"I agree. I'll take a look and see at that book. Maybe it's really me just forgetting how to do that. You know, how, as an adult, you find yourself a lot saying ""I wish someone older and wiser were there to tell me this or that""?"
ladycyclists,f7gde5z,t1_f7eyuzj,1573700817.0,That sounds great! It must feel amazing after a long race. I always used to just watch on the sideline. There's a neighborhood race every weekend where we used to live. That's as much of a race as I can get to. Haha!
