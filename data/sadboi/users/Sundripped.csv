Advice,fr3ptab,t3_gm4nxs,1589863045.0,"I'm 20 and I'm a sensitive guy, if you want to become heartless... Don't do it. I've done it and it's awful. The summer before freshman college I wanted to be a stone heartless guy cause that will keep me safe and make me attractive.

No, not even close. It made me hate myself even more eventually, and in the end I was begging the void for my emotions again.

Trust me man, it's better to cry and feel pain than to feel nothing and just not give a single fuck about anybody. I didn't care about strangers, my friends, my family, and my gf (even when the whole point of my heartlessness was to get a gf). They could have died and I felt like I would have been fine and not cared too much, that's how heartless I felt. It's a sad and hopeless existence to say the least. Nothing is fullfilling, nothing matters when you don't care at all 

 If you feel pain that means you feel love, and it may not feel this way now but it's better to feel pain and love, than to not care at all and feel nothing for anything.

I've been through it, and I really believe you shouldn't do it"
