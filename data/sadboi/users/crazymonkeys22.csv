That’s all I’ve noticed from my natural treatment so far. Not knowing about what’s going on in your body for so long & being affected so strongly is a very sad and frustrating experience.

Lyme,f475fah,t1_f46pvvw,1571417580.0,"It’s a long list, I apologize:

Most Frequent & Debilitating: Tingling in extremities, tinnitus, lock jaw, blurred/double vision/shaky eyes, extreme sensitivity to light, mental health issues (anxiety & bipolar II depression), myoclonic jerks, extreme irritability, brain fog & memory issues (honestly so bad sometimes - I couldn’t remember how to get home the other day. It feels like my brain is just not working), digestive/abdominal issues (have improved with diet changes - but growing up I was in & out of the hospital with no explanation as to wtf).

Frequent but Less Worrisome: dizziness/head rushes, jumbled words/stuttering, aching neck/back/knees (I fractured my neck 7 years ago so I’ve always attributed these pains to this, but now I have no idea), phlegm in my throat (constantly for the past year), difficulty peeing/peeing all of the time 

Least Frequent: difficulty breathing & swallowing while eating, chest/rib pain - my left lower ribs need to be reset every once in a while because they move outwards), random bouts of my heart feeling like it’s shaking my entire body bc it’s beating so hard & fast.

I’ve been diagnosed with mono, IBS, generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar II disorder, pretty sure my doctor thinks I have slight hypochondria at this point.

Edit: I even know I forgot a couple in here. I feel like it’s important to note that I really am a rational person. I honestly believe my health anxiety is a reaction to my symptoms & not the other way around. I was bit by a tick when I was 6yrs (26yrs old now)."

Serverlife,ergh3ds,t3_byyw5r,1560839093.0,"I may be repeating some of the advice already given, but my top tips would be:

1. Prepare as best you can when you’re not working so you feel more prepared at work! Bring a menu home & study it, practice holding three plates (two on your strong hand - there’s a trick where you lay the first plate on your forearm and balance it with the base of your palm & your pinky), learn the table numbers (which you already know if you’ve hosted there), memorize the beers on tap, house wines & bar rail (I write out a list and memorize it so I can say it the same way every time), choose a favourite app, entree and dessert from the menu in case someone asks for a suggestion, go in early to your shift & play around on the POS.

2. Don’t be afraid to ask for help. No one expects you to be a hero. It’s better to ask for help than end up in the weeds & start making mistakes/forgetting things!

3. Remember that even if you mess up completely at a table, that’s just one table and they’ll be gone soon. Life goes on. I used to obsess over my mistakes & upsetting tables, whereas now I just do the best I can & if I screw up I apologize to the table sincerely & then move on.

4. Ask your coworkers for the “best tips” they have on serving there. Each restaurant runs a little differently so it could be helpful.

5. Do your side duties! Don’t piss off your senior staff because you want to leave early.

6. Just be a nice person. Apologize if you mess up, explain that you’re new to serving and still learning, try to make conversation with your tables, help your coworkers if you have the time, respect the BOH, All that good stuff.

If you’re freaking out remember that it’s just a job :) You have to make some mistakes to learn. I have dropped a tray of drinks on a pregnant woman, forgotten about an entire table’s order and only realized 30 minutes later (and then forgot again for another 30), dropped 3 meals when the first three were at the table already...10 years later & I find it hilarious to look back on all of the crap I did when I was a newbie. 😂
