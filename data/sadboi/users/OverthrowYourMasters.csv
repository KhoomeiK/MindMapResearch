if you want a psychiatrist (not a therapist) thats board certified, listens to you for more than 15 mins, and takes youre entire case into account when prescribing, get ready to pay over $300 per session. it's not that they're greedy. their training is incredibly expensive and difficult. the number of psychiatrists in the US is controlled by limited access to training (med school, residency placement, mentorship, etc.). no matter how much money we put into paying psychiatrists on a social level, the demand is too much for the supply. there arent psychiatrists sitting around hoping they get customers. theyre booked out for months in many cases. so it's not a matter of funding for patients to access care. its a matter of creating more psychiatrists, which surely has political resistance."

think about this. if you're uneducated in science, what's the difference between news channels? none. you pick the one that is most attractive cause you don't know about legitimate research. you don't have the skills to critique information to reach an objective conclusion. so you go with the one that is the most engaging. after all, if youre not watching tv to serve an atypical specific purpose, it's just entertainment.

Even the secret service has to be sick of his self-centered approach putting their lives on the line.  Let me be clear, **I am in no way advocating violence**.  A presidential assassination wont undo the corruption he's shoved throughout our Federal Government or the support he's gotten throughout the country.  This is a propaganda war.  If he's gone, the next buffoon will be ready to take his place.

I'm am certain that in 5-10 years, we will learn that the extent of corruption is like a glacier.  We're only seeing 10% of the whole shit show.  Think about it.  He's got the executive branch on lock.  The Senate and Attorney General (and the FBI by extension) have given him the go-ahead. He is working with the understanding that there will be no consequences to pay.  This is beyond the corruption of the Bush family.  I believe this presidency will eventually *trump*  Benedict Arnold as the prototype for the American traitor.

The numbers regarding COVID19 that we are seeing are entirely false.  They aren't allowing testing.  Of all the people I know personally that have tried to get a COVID19 test, they all said it was a mission: taking three days, multiple providers and locations, and eventually, had to figure some convoluted way to get tested.  And the kicker is that they are healthcare workers!  yeah, I'm sure there are people that are getting tests easily, but that's certainly not the case for a good portion of the population.
