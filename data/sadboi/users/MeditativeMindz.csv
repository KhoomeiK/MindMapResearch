The Smiths (your line about oversized clothes is very Smiths like, fantastic).
Kate Bush

It would be super lucky if you get a camp site visitor the same day the plot is made for sale however I wouldn't bet on it.

If you don't get a camper or find someone you like on a mystery island, then a complete random person will move in. Of course is a camper does appear after a new villager has moved in, and you ask the camper to move in, they could select the newly added villager to move out so they can move in.

Leon and Claire are already in the RE Engine and have animations to go from the 2nd remake game. Chris has already been in the engine in RE7, but he would need 3rd person animations to be added. 

I could definitely see them adding some more masterminds too, either Nikolai, Wesker, maybe even some saddo from RE6 like Simmons.

There is a lot of fun to be had trust me! Enjoy!"
residentevil,fmedyvs,t1_fmec5hs,1586000466.0,"I prefer the originals to both RE2R and RE3R but that's because I love the fixed angles and the cheesy dialogue.

The game has the same amount of action as the original. RE3 original had more action than RE2 original and remake, and the same is here with RE3R. 

Some areas are cut which is a slight disappointment if you have played the original as some of those areas would have been fantastic for this updated engine. There are less puzzles. RE3 original had some of the toughest puzzles in the whole series and the remake only has like 3 in total. Nemesis is still fun, but is underused in this game. In the original, he chases you for about 80% of the game. And that 20% when he wasn't was either when playing Carlos or fighting Grave Digger (who is also missing in the remake). 

I would highly recommend playing the originals on PC if you can either before or after you play this. Just so you can see the differences yourself. You can get some nice HD texture mods and it makes the games look like some indie game from today. 

If you're a fan of the series, you have to get it either way. I loved it. Sure it took me 4 5 hours to be on standard difficulty (7.5 hours if you include cutscenes and files). Which is roughly the same time as RE2R. But I am looking forward to playing through with different weapons and on the 2 extra difficulty modes as well trying to earn that S rank.

It will no doubt keep me entertained for the oncoming few weeks. And like RE2R, I'll keep coming back to it evert few months for a playthrough too.

RE3 has two additional difficulty modes compared to RE 2 which mixes up item placements and enemy behaviours  that's replayability right there. I loved it, wish they had kept some elements of the original like the Clocktower, or Nemesis's behaviour, but that is just a small gripe. There are a lot of unlockables to get and challenges to complete to unlock new weapons like new knives or pistols for example.

Resistance for me is a lot of fun. But I love multiplayer games like Dead By Daylight where it is 4 weaker characters vs 1 strong character. There are skins, weapons skins, taunts, sprays, different abilities to unlock for both Survivor and Mastermind. As Mastermind, you can even unlock different zombie cosmetics. For me I will be playing this a bunch. No doubt they'll add more maps and characters too."

In the original, the Clocktower is seen as the mid point of the game I guess, Jill was supposed to be rescued by a chopper there but Nemesis shoots it down which leads to the boss fight.

The Grave Digger comes after the park section, which they removed from RE3 Remake too (although I am not bothered about that, it was easily my least favourite segment of the original). This was where the Gamma Hunters (now in the sewers for remake) and worm enemies were. You also ran into Nikolai here in a cabin which was also completely scrapped. The grave digger would have looked awesome in Remake so I am surprised they didn't include it, albeit even if it was like they did with the Aligator in RE2."
residentevil,fmd2yxt,t1_fmd0xqq,1585958173.0,"Well it depends on how you play RE Games. I did my first run on standard and it took 4.5 hours in game time (7.5 hours including cutscenes/file readings). However, there are a total of 5 difficulty options, two additional unlocks. A hardcore difficulty playthrough has averaged for most people at 8-12 hours including multiple deaths and cutscenes. Then you unlock Nightmare, then you unlock Inferno. If you want to S Rank, then that'll require another play through right there. There are also collectables to get, and unlockable rewards such as costumes, weapons, and infinite ammo weapons. 

Then you have Resistance, what I have played is very fun but I love asymmetrical multiplayers anyway. In that, there are a bunch of cosmetics to unlock from taunts, skins, weapon skins. You can unlock new abilities, equipment etc. Daily challenges. So if you like playing Resistance, then you have so much you can work towards.

So is it worth full price, for me yes as I will probably be playing through the campaign about 4 times to 100% the game. And then Resistance could keep me entertained for several weeks. If you only care about playing the game once and not touch resistance, then no. Definitely wait for a sale.
