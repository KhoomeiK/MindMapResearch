bipolar,fqlg8vh,t1_fqkn3d2,1589457241.0,"Yes, my behaviour is often branded by others around me as being caused because of bipolar,an example was when someone thought I had overeacted eg being upset by a friend of my X-boyfriend's suicide, it made me anxious but another person thought I was depressed as they knew about my diagnosis.  People want to label your behaviour when in reality you can't even experience what would be a normal response to a situation. I always feel like I'm under a microscope when people know of my bipolar. I have recently been asked 'do you suffer from mental health problems', well the only suffering, is caused by other people who misinterpret your thoughts and feelings.  As the saying goes, 'i'm alright, it's all the others'"

bipolar,fitabpc,t1_fita28a,1582711872.0,Do you think stress/life events are a trigger?
bipolar,fit7a3l,t1_fit5ui0,1582707762.0,"Thanks that's interesting, you're lucky to have had the benefit of therapy for 2 years, I've never been offered therapy during the 20 years since diagnosis"
bipolar,fisyj8y,t1_fisq9n3,1582697346.0,"I agree, I have had a period of relative stability and experienced some big life stressors but luckily I haven't become manic. When I was first ill with bipolar, it was often when life was good and things were going well for me that I would go high or if I went down, I just couldn't identify why. My mum and brother also have bipolar and there seems no rhyme or reason as to why they go up or down."
