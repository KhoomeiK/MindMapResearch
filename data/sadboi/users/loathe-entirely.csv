Ahaha that is such a good bonus of being on a sloop. The majority of galley’s and brig’s will leave you alone because they don’t think you’ll have a lot of loot but how wrong they can be! We have a system to unloading and selling, we’ll park the ship on the dock where the merchant is and then one person drops all the loot onto the dock itself from the front of the ship while the rest of us run back and forth to pick it up and sell it.

Now they have a lotttt more content (including a solid PVP mode called Arena if you like ship battles) and I’m really glad we went back to it. If you do the Tall Tales they have an overarching storyline and I believe there are nine in total so does take quite a bit of time to get through them all.
