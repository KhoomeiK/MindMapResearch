Sounds like it could be the medication, porn can cause erectile dysfunction because it’s so much dopamine, basically dairy eggs and meat causes inflammation in the body and clogs arteries and milk lowers tesosterone in males because it has real esterogen that gets used by our body I’d suggest drinking soy milk instead,"

Yes i have been very suicidal and I still am I almost ended my life a month ago, and you want to know what gets me by?

I think you should bring it up but I wouldn’t say often but from time to time and just make it clear sometimes when you do eat food be more encouraging about it.

What changed my point of view and made me become vegan was the documentary the game changers. I like tmy health and that made me be very open minded and susceptible to changing based off that documentary.

Everyone  reacts differently to information based on what is important to them, With that being said there are many approaches you can take to changing them to become vegan you just need to know where to hit them,
For example:
A - Is global warming most important to them?
B - Are the lives of animals important to them?
C - is health important for them? As you may know vegan diet reverses all cause mortality, increases longevity etc...
I’m in the process of changing my mum with some facts day by day she comes in from a money perspective that it’s dear to go vegan and that she needs it for her health, calcium for her bones iron for her blood etc just lies that she’s been fed, the main thing is to hit them where you know will open there mind and not to overwhelm people with information because you can come across as crazy"

depression,fmcxgvs,t1_fm985qa,1585954813.0,"Just because we ate meat doesn’t mean we need it to survive, so that debunks the whole argument of I need meat to survive, you can have  a perfectly balanced diet and get all your essential amino acids from plant based foods along with all the protein you need with out mass murdering animals that your eating and also wiping out total species to extinction in the Amazon because we need more land so we can farm corn and stuff to feed the cattle that your eating, if I know one thing in my opinion humans came to earth to love it not to destroy it it’s because of cognitive dissonance people know it’s bad but they don’t give a fuck because they believe the lies of society that you need it for a balanced diet, that it’s healthy when in fact meat is carcinogenic and causes a lot of diseases, heart attacks, cardiovascular disease diabetes, erectile dysfunction the list goes on, also contributing to global warming because more than half of the green house gases come from live animal stock"
