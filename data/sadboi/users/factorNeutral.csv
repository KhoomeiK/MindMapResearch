Here you have an industry here “failure is not an option”. You have to be certain that the device isn’t going to malfunction and kill someone.  Given this the industry is slow moving, for good reason! That is to say that these crazy quantum leaps aren’t too common in the medical device industry (but I’m happy for an expert to correct me). 

Additionally, given how large and profitable the dialysis market is I’m relatively sure (~80%) she isn’t the only one looking at how to make dialysis faster and easier to do. There is probably a good reason why existing manufacturers of dialysis equipment didn’t chose to go down that route, likely due to the fact that these medical and engineering tradeoffs for smaller size and faster dialysis wouldn’t resonate with their market. 

Now, these tradeoffs could be acceptable for use in remote areas and developing countries (markets which are sadly mostly ignored by big pharma and medical device companies) where a machine transportability and speed (so one machine can service more people) are paramount."

I’m saying that journalism is missing nuance. The article contains very little information that wasn’t included in the title (most extra info that was included was supplemental). 

I think 10x the cost is conservative, FDA trials can cost $100mm+ dollars and take years to complete before the company sees a cent in revenue. Health care device manufacturing has to follow stringent standards which makes at scale manufacturing very expensive. 

Additionally, there are always healthcare and engineering tradeoffs for making something smaller. I’d like to know what they are. Is there a higher risk of infection? Does it require more disposable parts that are expensive? Does it use more energy? Does the higher flow rate make this device unsuitable for patients with certain cardiovascular / blood / renal conditions? I’d be surprised if the answer was no to all these and similar questions."

My intent of this comment is to criticize bad journalism.  

1) When they say $500 what they mean is that the bill of materials for the prototype is $500. A lab prototype’s BoM likely isn’t using certified medical grade components which would be used in a commercialized device

2) if this device is commercialized there will be a fixed cost of production that isn’t included in the “$500” BoM. 

3) The cost of getting the device approved by the FDA, plus the fact that successful medical products need to pay for the development costs of products which don’t make it through trials also needs to be factored into the sales price.  

All said and done this machine would likely cost significantly more than $500. 

Additionally, I’d imagine that shrinking the size of the machine and the time it takes to complete treatment has some medical and engineering trade offs. I’d love for the article to speak to those. Those trade offs could be worth it in emergency situations and for traveling / bush doctors in remote locations. However this article frankly pushes the story that a teen built a dialysis machine that’s nearly an order of magnitude better in cost, size, and duration of treatment than the existing state of the art, which I find very hard to believe."

Psychedelics have helped me to process a lot of what happened in my childhood and the learned behaviors those experiences caused. However, it’s a real gamble whenever you use them. If you really do have your mind set on trying them I’d suggest the following:

1. Basic set and setting, having a trip sitter etc
2. Please check for drug interactions, let your psychiatrist know what you’re planning on doing
3. Take a small dose, my experience as someone with bipolar is that small doses are significantly easier to navigate and have ended up being more rewarding for me. You can even try microdosing to make sure you don’t have an adverse reaction.
4. Make sure you go into the experience after a number of good nights of sleep and not having done other drugs / alcohol for some period of time. You are taking a large risk so you’ll want to remove as many other risk factors as you can.
5. More importantly, make sure you get a multiple good nights of sleep after your experience.

AskReddit,eoii7is,t3_brzuwa,1558620270.0,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar I several years ago. I feel psychosis is really misunderstood. While it’s an extremely dangerous state to be in (both for oneself and others), I feel we move too quick to dismiss the subjective content of the experience.

In my opinion the experience isn’t meant to be taken at face value. When examining the symbolic and emotional underpinnings of the experience one can get a deep sense of one’s hopes, dreams, fears and generally just a deep perspective into one’s consciousness. While I’d never want to be psychotic again, I treasure the opportunity I had to experience that state of mind. I do understand that I am speaking from a place of luck and privilege. The situation could have turned out much worse, and others cannot even think about their past experiences without risking another episode."
AskReddit,eoih170,t1_eohxnpx,1558619515.0,"While I tentatively agree, currently it is near impossible to distinguish poor coping skills from serious conditions until serious symptoms present themselves (e.g. psychotic episodes, suicide attempts), if they do at all. 

Given this, I feel like comments like these tend to muddy the waters,  aren’t really productivity, and can hinder efforts to be more transparent and accepting. Additionally, therapy and other mental health services (other than medication, where over prescription is a problem) can benefit both ones with debilitating illness  and those whose simply have poor coping skills. 

In my opinion, outside of the over medication discussion, this distinction really isn’t that helpful."
bipolar,eoh4l6g,t3_brwd5l,1558572756.0,"Thanks for sharing your story! I was diagnosed as BP1 a few years back after a full blown psychotic manic episode. I’d say I was manic for around a week before being brought to the psych ward. 

First I want to say don’t blame yourself. Mental health is a very tricky situation, and especially if one generally has a naturally quirky and colorful personality it can be hard to pull the trigger and drive someone to the hospital. I was speaking with my parents on a daily basis during my episode and it still took slightly over a week for me to get admitted.

To answer your main question, I find with my own experience (as well as with others I’ve spoken with) there really never is a singular cause. My experience was caused by a confluence of a significant life event (ending of a relationship), a difficult drug (psychedelic) experience, marijuana use, as well as frustrations with years of related mental health issues (irritability, anxiety, depression etc...) and what turned into an obsessive longing to get better, as ironic as it sounds. 

Hearing what you said, I understand that your daughter’s THC use worries you and your husband and is a low hanging fruit to eliminate while on the road to recovery. Yet, my own use (as well as many others) stems from a need to self medicate. When you don’t know what the hell is going on with your mind, drugs (especially marijuana for whatever reason) can provide a consistent soothing experience in the midst of a chaotic world. What caused me to examine and curtail my own use was understanding that dynamic and how it would never provide the relief I was seeking. 

Right before I entered the hospital my father  “came down” on me regarding all the negative behaviors he believe I had exhibited in the past (my drug use, overconfident nature at times etc...). While I know that he was reacting to a stressful situation in the only way he knew how, this experience forever altered my relationship with him. I still love him, but I cannot think about him for more than a few minutes without reliving that moment of self loathing and hatred as I listen to him berate me while I was already down. 

I am overjoyed to hear that your husband is waiting until she recovers to speak with your daughter. I understand that as parents you bring perspectives to the table that I cannot understand first hand. However I implore you to phrase that eventual discussion as one which seeks to understand the details of how a self medication habit works and how that negatively affects one’s mental health while simultaneously giving one the impression that it’s helping. 

When it comes to her BF, I think it’s important for him to understand that even with the best intentions one can end up hurting someone, even if it’s through implicit enablement. 

Sorry for the long post. I hope you find this helpful. Feel free to PM me if you need."
