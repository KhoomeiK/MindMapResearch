What makes it banter is the other person engaging and enjoying it, instead of retaliating to maybe gain some power. Banter like this usually doesn’t work with kids and their parents until they’re late teens (I don’t know how old your son is, so I apologise if he is in his late teens), because the parents have more power over the household. Besides, even if all of the things I’ve mentioned weren’t issues, there’s still the fact that what your husband is saying is in no way structured to be funny. Banter between friends (like your husband is trying to do) isn’t that direct. It sounds like he’s just being mean. For example, me and my friends might call each other ugly, but it’s not just straight up “You’re ugly”. That’s just rude, no matter if you were trying to be funny or not. We would usually add it as a comment to something they’ve just said. Like the friend would be talking about how much deodorant they got for Christmas (?), and is hop in with “I think there’s a reason for that, if ya know what I mean”

What your husband is doing is degrading and while he might mean it in a positive way, this most certainly is not going to have a positive impact on your son."

I am pretty damn violent myself, but there is NO WAY in HELL I would ever do anything to hurt a family member, except maybe the cousin who acts similar to your sister does (I only see her about once a year though so I’m lucky). If your sister lived in my house with me... she would not have acted like that with me because I would have ended up pouring glue in her hair while she slept, throwing all her shit into a bonfire, and I would punch her back twice as hard when she hit me, no matter what she said about calling the cops. 

You see, I do hit my cousin back when _she_ is like this, but I always make sure to have a recorder in my pocket whenever she visits because of things like this. After one or two more visits, I’ll have enough evidence to get a restraining order _at least_, even at my age (15f). Seriously, some of the shit she’s said to me is similar to what your sister has said, about suicide and the like. I suggest you do the same, but make sure you have enough evidence before doing anything with it. It’s all about the element of surprise with these things, if you take it to court or something and there isn’t enough, she’ll know you could be recording her next time and she’ll do things a bit more secretly. Maybe throw water on you and _then_ proceed to spout nonsense."
