I do feel for your mom too...it’s hard to blame her for not wanting to uproot herself at this point in her life. And I guess your brother had tried to be helpful in his own way, but now he’s just being heavy handed. The only other thing I can suggest is for him to talk to your other siblings. Maybe if all of you guys can take turns staying with her on weekends (say one weekend a month for each of you), the load would be lighter.

The loss of your dad has taken a toll on you and your whole family, and I’m so sorry."

If he insists someone should stay with her, it might as well be him. She’s his mom too. And no amount of abuse from him will change the fact of you having a lease to pay.

I’m not sure why he won’t listen to reason from you, but I hope things work out well for both you and your mom."

How about YouTube? I’ve seen videos for strength training (with and without weights), stretching, and aerobics. You guys can do them together. :) I don’t know the extent of lockdown where you’re at, but in my area we’re allowed to step out for walks as long as we don’t go anywhere crowded. So no group activities, and staying close to one’s community is best, but you and your gf can still go and move around a bit. Just being outdoors helps some.

Don’t beat yourself up for not getting there yet. Your parents laid a lot of burdens on you. They *did* hurt you in really fundamental ways even if maybe they didn’t mean to. You’re allowed to process everything that happened; you’re allowed to feel hurt.
