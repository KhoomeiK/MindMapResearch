The real question is why isn't everyone?  Before you pursue any strategies to limit this behavior pick up a responsibility, a good habit, or a fulfilling hobby.  Being up early or being well rested enough to do that will be all you need.

I declined.  She attempted suicide, but fortunately it didn't work so my kids still have a mother.  Now she's living across town with some loser and is desperately poor.  Nobody had to get these hands for me to feel vindicated over the heartbreak.  You'll have a similar story.  Her choosing someone else will mean less and less that you are the inferior man and more and more as evidence that ol' girl has a fractured guidance system.

I think that she just decided she was gonna leave and picked one known problem with you and is using it as a rationalization.  Depression is sometimes comorbid with intelligence, a good sense of duty, and a laundry list of other admirable character traits.  I'll again encourage you to be careful of your narratives.  Stuff happens.  The things that we treasure can be taken away from us.  I have felt the same way about the duty to my own children.  It comes from a noble place but in an honest assessment you can see how your ability to rationalize your existence is dependent on a few factors right now.  You would want the next guy your ex gets with to be a good person who likes kids and treats yours well, but by framing your narrative thusly it's almost a way to weasel little tendrils of control into your ex's situation.  No need to feel worthless if your kids wind up loving their new step dad or if your ex decides to be a harpy and find an arbitrary reason to try to fuck with your custody.  I can tell that you're a thoughtful dude and that's good because you need a plan right now for how to be okay even if all kinds of ratchet shit happens to you.  Work on planning how you're gonna weather some of the potential problems you're in for.  Know who you are and disconnect your agenda from other people's potentially stupid decisions.

People leave for all kinds of reasons, but she didn't have to leave you because of your depression any more than an army wife has to leave her soldier when his legs get blown off at the knees by an IED.  Now that being said if you can admit that depression was impacting family life and there were things you could have done then the better narrative is ""depression (which can happen to the best of us negatively impacted my ability to maintain a relationship and as a result she chose to leave rather than stick around.""  This is a little big more empowering and slightly more true of a narrative.  It also means that there are things that you can do and none of them include controlling your ex's behavior unless you make sure to court order some things into your custody agreement.  You can work on trying experiments to control symptoms.  I'd suggest the book F*ck Feelings.  Also make sure you get yourself in front of professionals, establish good personal routines, and become an expert on your Self.  People function at very high levels even with serious depression and I want you to be one of those people.  Also, things are probably likely to get worse, so if at any point you develop suicidal monitor yourself closely and if you start to plan it out get yourself under the observation of family or doctors because it's probably a temporary chemical trick of the mind."

So from a starting point of honesty and a minimum of neurosis about what is I will undertake activities for which the goal is the activity itself, not its end.

Not only that, but ""full potential"" is a phrase rife with fiction and ambiguity.  One would have to create a narrative of words and thoughts to describe what it meant for them in full detail only to self-flagellate when they fear that today's performance may cause an irretrievable loss of some of that coveted potential.

I'm saying that I've tried goals, plans, schemes, dreams and contrivences, visions, and forward thinking.  All to disappointing and sometime hilariously ironic results.

I think that riding on the back of optimism as if it were an ox, keeping myself in a high vibe state, and resolving to make the present moment good while focusing on a wholesome aim to be a ""decent person"" and ""help others"" might make for less personal anxiety.

After all.  Maybe one's vision of their full potential pales in comparison to what might happen in real life if we aren't so fixated on control.

Lao Tzu says ""When I let go of who I am, I'm free to become what I might be.""

To presume that we have enough information to apprehend a true vision of our ""full potential"" seems a lot more unlikely to me right now than a relative certainty that I might like to dance to Rage Against the Machine and that something like fitness might emerge from that choice rather than the choice to remain in bed in the fetal position crushed by the inevitable loss of my ""full potential""

Now it goes without saying that you have a very good point about the pitfalls of aimlessness.  I'm just running an experiment for the next little while based on these ideas.  I'm practicing faith that the next step might arise organically.

For some reason when on the frequency of self hate it's easy to cherry-pick a handful of qualities about ourselves that we deem to be ""bad.""  And then cleverly focus on those qualities in ignorance of the other qualities.  Another fun trick is to set a goal or desire cleverly just out of reach so that it can be used as evidence for a deserved self-flagellation.  Both of these lines of thinking can be recognized as fictional, but its awfully hard to see ourselves clearly from a state of self-hate.
