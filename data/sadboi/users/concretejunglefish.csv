food,fnr0upk,t1_fnpz32b,1587176602.0,"It’s really tasty, it’s sweet but spicy. There’s fish cake and spring onions in it. I’ve added bacon and a boiled egg with runny yolk for added flavours. 

I’ve been wanting to try making this for awhile now since it’s one of my favourite dishes that I always order out. This lockdown has given me a reason to. Gotta curb that craving some how!"

PanPorn,fla1ug3,t1_fl9yji9,1584974763.0,"Not OP, but I was given this as a gift in the same shade and omg the balm is so good and thick. Personally I like it, it last longer than most lip balms I’ve used. It’s also much nicer smelling/tasting than others I’ve tried and surprisingly it lasted me a lot longer than usual with everyday use. Would def recommend!"

askSingapore,finswpw,t1_fimlg5m,1582569509.0,"Personally, not in Singapore as I’ve never worked part time there but there definitely are, you just have to look."
askSingapore,fim4360,t3_f8l4in,1582517604.0,"I’ve done all the colours you can think of. Personally, I’d say do it? You’re young, probably going to study. The only thing I think you might worry about is getting a part time job while studying but honestly, as someone who was living both in SG and London during that time, even now, I’d say don’t let someone’s opinion on something small like this stop you from trying out something you’d want to do. The worse that can happen with hair is you either dye it back or cut it. It’s not the end of the world. Don’t let small people get in your way. 

My advise for hair colour itself, if you’re afraid then gradually brighten the colour over time. Or try semi permanent hair dyes like manic panic, arctic fox as they’re good if you’re scared to do it or fickle and also much less damaging especially if you have bleached hair. 

In terms of jobs, I am in the arts so I don’t have an issue with it affecting me and work but I think most people who do want to have such colours do so before they start working full time as most sectors such as law, banking etc won’t allow it so they do it before."
london,fc4bit4,t3_eg31pp,1577411902.0,"Seems like a very nice chilled day to me. I just slept in and cleaned the house really, besides plying a bit of fortnite here and there with my friend. Love the BA stuff you do thought they look cool btw. Been alone since the 24th Dec cause everyone in the house is off so it’s just been really quiet. A quiet peaceful day is always better than one filled with a lot of drama, so I hope you have a good New Years too 😌😌"

The one closest to me signals letting me know I could cross and I did, believing him that the traffic light was green. Only to be nearly hit my a car at full speed. I turn to him in shock as he laughs and gets ready to turn. It is because of him that I now get very anxious and scared when crossing roads even when I know the traffic light is green."

expat,evcys7h,t3_cjc9wh,1564426284.0,"Aww I hope you get through it. For me it’s still all so new and the cultures are far too apart so I’ve learnt to take things with a grain of salt and learn to be patient as while it may seem like your old life, so much has changed within the last 5-10years that while everything  may seem and feel familiar, it can be very different. Give yourself time to adapt, be patient and keep busy. As then you’ll start getting used to things and push yourself forward. 

While I do feel homesick to a country that isn’t even mine, I guess I’ve learnt to not dwell on it by keeping busy or giving myself something to do or look forward to. Maybe even remind myself other possibilities that can happen too where I am. 

You’ll be ok. Good luck too with the move and I hope everything will go smoothly on your end :)"

Thank you so much for your help btw it’s been very informative. May I ask if you know, as they ask to provide the actual copy of previous visa entry which I have a BRP. Do I need to provide both the originals as it’s been over 5 years and I don’t have both the passport and old visa anymore, only scanned copies but they’re asking for originals.... 

Again thank you so much for your help and am so sorry for the delayed response."
