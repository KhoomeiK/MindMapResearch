AmItheAsshole,foz0jnz,t3_gaa8t7,1588182583.0,"YTA and a big one at that. I'd feel horrible if my boyfriend said that to me, and my self esteem would take a huge hit. I'd also begin being resentful of him for choosing how I should look and act with my body.
You wouldn't like if I went up to you and listed all of the things I hated about your appearence, or at least disliked. And you'd begin to get mad at me for always questioning your looks. Maybe you'd lose interest in me, because after all, what kind of friend would be so rude knowingly? Maybe you'd think I wasn't a friend after all..  You'd get sad, and upset that I said those things. 
If your girlfriend wants to dress this way, it's really up to her, and only her. You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you love her personality but don't like her looks, you can't just pick and choose. You've gotta make up your mind about if you're okay with this, and if not, then there's two (maybe more that I haven't thought of) options. 
1) let her go, and allow her to be as she is, or/and wants to be. It's okay to have preferences, but forcing them onto someone is never right.  
2) accept that she's not your doll, and can have her own style without having to be scrutinized by you. Maybe find something to do you both enjoy together, and try to move past her style not suiting your taste, instead of getting caught up by her looks changing rather than her personality staying the same. 

Either way good luck, and I hope you realize that it's okay for her to have her own style, and actually a bit toxic/obsessive for a partner to decide how the other one can look/act."

I don't think a licsenced psychiatrist would define a cold bath as a suffient reason to base a PTSD diagnosis on, based on the fact that the criteria that has to be met for something to be classified as traumatic enough to envoke PTSD has to be either life threatening, violent, chocking to an extreme degree (such as for example a family member dying, or a close friend dying), sexually, psychically or mentally abusive,  or disturbing to the degree that no one could have gone through such a thing without getting effected long term by it. If you already have PTSD mixed with autism, that can for sure make you more sensitive and give you an unpleasant time, but to call it full on traumatic is maybe a stretch in my opinion.

I might be cynical, but I really don't think that a paper cut in of itself I a trauma that gives a person ptsd. I understand if one already has a trauma connected to blood or getting cut, that it can then retraumatize the person, or if a person fell in the harbor that the cold water can retraumatize one, but I don't think that simply being caught off guard by cold water can traumatize you to the extend of getting ptsd.
