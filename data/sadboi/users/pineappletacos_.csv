relationship_advice,fppp8gi,t3_geobig,1588806504.0,"I haven't read any comments, so forgive me if I'm repetitive. But EFF THAT. What was the the fucking text? Does it MATTER? UGHH. I would feel exactly like you. I would be angry. Unforgiving. Everything. And I'm twice your age. So. Good for you for not being pressured and sticking to your shit. Bring angry never helped anything, but if you're angry, YOURE ANGRY!  

You will forgive him. You both will grow up and he will have this life long lesson which I hope he learned from first of all, and you  also have this totally different life lesson and grow to realize, he was 18.  He was a kid too. And although it did cost you breaking your neck, could have died, been paralyzed....he was a kid. Is it an excuse? No. Does it make it okay? Fuck no. But!!!!! People make mistakes!!! We're not at all perfect. Some are better than others at decision making but .. who can draw the line there??? 

I guess whats important is you're alive! But shame on parents for trying to rush and force you into forgiveness.  It'll come.  It will. You will remember that you LOVE your brother. And as you grow you will love him more. And the forgiveness will come. So.... Don't rush. Don't feel pressured. Let time do its thing, but also I think it's really important to not exacerbate the situation. 

You know, you're the younger sibling here if I read correctly. So it sucks that you have to be a little more mature In the situation, but there's definitely no need to make him feel any worse, make your parents feel any worse, or make yourself feel any worse. So don't be nasty. Just reassure them forgiveness will come, at your own time. And stop pressuring you, as it adds to the anger!!! You have  broken fucking neck because your brother made a dumb decision and now you have to go through all this AND feel pressured to ""forgive him""?   No.
 You have every right to be angry!!! Don't forget that. But use it for good. :) Do some art. Write a song. Write an angry poem. Do your physical therapy and work HARD. Come back BETTER. STRONGER.

Does that make sense? I hope I didn't come across like your parents. Be you. Your feelings are valid. Negative or not. 

I'm glad you're alive ."

I used to be productive.""  *Insert more bullshit excuses here*  

I had a routine where I would start in the morning and stop by noon so I could still sleep at night and function as a normal person. I was so depressed and lazy that I just really loved being UP.  I got too comfortable with it and kind of, failed to realize the reality of what I was actually doing and how serious it was. 

My best friend got arrested one night buying and I was honestly scared straight. (I was not with her but I helped bail her out) I didn't want my parents to make the connection so, I quit cold turkey that day, relapsed once and hated it.

No man or woman or friend goes before my husband. Sorry. I have no need to secretly go to lunch with men. And if I ever do go to lunch with a man, which as you said, men and women CAN be friends, I have absolutely no problem letting my husband know ahead of time, rather than after the fact.

relationships,ev0tbpb,t3_chqo21,1564146181.0,"This shit annoyed the fuck out of me, (not your post, but their behavior). It's really fucking stupid if you think about it. Totally unnecessary and disrespectful, and if they say nothing is going on, well guess what, being sneaky and not sharing plans, and going out of your way to spend extra time with someone else, MAKES IT LOOK LIKE SOMETHING IS GOING ON.  I really think anyone in your position would feel this way and they need to cut the shit. It's fucking inappropriate, period. 

Think about it. Do you ever hide anything from anyone? And if so, why?  Why can't he tell you the morning of, that he is having lunch with HER. If there is nothing more than a friendship, what's the harm in letting you know? 

I've actually lost a friendship over this. I was getting married and my friend kept inserting herself into places she had no business being.  She told me one day that my fiance asked her to help him pick out a ring for me. I got so angry. I went back to my fiance and said, ""if she has anything to do with picking my ring, I'm going to lose it. I do not want her sharing stories at OUR wedding about how SHE picked MY ring. This should come from you, and even if it was the ugliest ring, it would still be from YOU, and I'd love it. ""

He was very confused. He said he never asked her anything. In fact, she came to him and said ""you better take me with you to pick out her ring.""  I was so confused. Why would she change the story like that? (My husband is many things, but he doesn't do drama and he doesn't lie.) Why does she want me to think my fiance wants her to go with him so badly? 

Anyway, call me insecure if you will, but I told him I'd like US to distance ourselves from her. I needed time as newlyweds and time to grow with my new husband. And it was important that I felt safe and secure in the early stages of our marriage. I felt she was toxic to us and although I didn't think my husband would do anything with her, he is a nice guy.  (She would often text him as well, instead of texting me. She would ask him for favors when she needed a man, even tho she has brothers and a father. And she would invite only him out to lunch.)

The fact that my husband was up for it showed I was more important. If he would have said, "" no, she's my friend too, I will not stop hanging with her behind your back"" idk what I would have done! Maybe I wouldn't have been married for the last 7 years. 

The point is, she was my friend for 10 years, and I don't for ONE SECOND regret distancing myself from her. I don't care how much fun I had with her or how long we had been friends. Whether it was malicious or innocent, she was causing problems for us.  Friendships will come and go, but my husband is my forever.  I needed us to be first. 

Friend and I talk again. We're okay, but things will never be the same. She's engaged now, and I cannot even IMAGINE texting her fiance, trying to go to lunch with him, or just hanging with him one on one and NOT TELLING HER. 

Sorry for long story of my life, but I just related to this so much. I just wanted to share my experience and that I may have lost a friend, but I was still happy every single day with my husband. People are jerks and inconsiderate, and I hope you get to the bottom of things. And whatever you decide to do, i hope husband LISTENS and UNDERSTANDS and STANDS NEXT TO YOU IN SUPPORT OF YOUR FEELINGS, as a partner in life should. 

Best of luck!."

Different diets work for different people and if she needed bread and pasta in her life daily , more power to her. I never ever made it sound like what I was doing was BETTER. It just worked FOR ME. 

She was so against no carbs. She said it's not good for you. Not good for your brain. Blah blah and I said okay. Then eat carbs. What's the big deal?  You don't have to explain yourself to me. But vegetables are carbs too. Not just bread and pasta. 

Fast forward a few months, she is now restricting carbs.  I don't get why I have to constantly defend myself and my ways and now she's jumping on the bandwagon. Is that a friendship? 

We talk about everything! Sex, poop, boogers, food, happiness, sadness, You name it, we've discussed it. But god forbid I tell her how a 10 min workout will be done before she knows it?!?!?
