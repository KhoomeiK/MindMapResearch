My husband has stuck with me through depression of varying  degrees over the years and I'm so grateful for it. Looking back I know I wasn't thinking and acting like myself so it means a lot that he could see through it, I know it wasn't easy. But his doing that also taught our sons what a partner and parent does. So I know it sucks but if you possibly can, try to work through it with her. You're modeling for the kids you're raising of what it means to be a good human being. 

 I hope you two can work through it!"

Your pointing it out will only make her hurt and angry. She may be depressed which would explain the lack of activity and hobbies. I suggest talking about that rather than weight, the weight is only evidence of a larger issue. If you can help her work on possible depression, she will learn to get back to herself,  take more pride in her appearance, get interested in your marriage again, find passion in hobbies again...the weight issue will get better as those more important issues are dealt with in a healthy way."

I usually respond well to medication but this one.... dizzy, spaced out, nauseous, stuffy nose, blurred vision, edgy, extremely anxious...4 separate people pulled me aside and asked if I was ok because was not myself at all. Rode it out for a month then pulled the plug. You have to give things time but you also have to know when something just isn't working for you. I hope you find your good mix, stay positive!"
Mirtazapine_Remeron,fcad0ki,t3_egna3d,1577567058.0,I just tried adding mirtz to my current effexor dose per doctor suggestion and it was the worst 4 weeks of my life. But I can't say it was the combination I think I just personality didn't process mirtz well. I've read others do well on it
AskWomen,fc9ur4r,t1_fc8m06l,1577558514.0,"As a female who sold cars for 7 years and am now executive manager at a dealership I don't get how this still happens! We are taught and trained and experience that in 85% of households the woman is the primary researcher and decision maker. She definitely knows more about the household budget and probably knows more about the car than the husband and salesman put together. I have a million stories about it LOL. I try to recruit as many females as I can into the biz, it's a great career and maybe we can get the Neanderthals to join this century, or condesend to them and ignore them to only talk to their wife."
mentalhealth,fc6zx2v,t1_fc5kbca,1577493830.0,"You nailed it! Acceptance of the reality isn't defeat or surrender,  it's smart and friggin hard to do. I've learned to own it, go through long periods of healthy and balanced then relapse.  My Dr. said the same thing you did: ""if you had diabetes we wouldn't be having this conversation about going off meds. Your depression is a long long road. The same way the dark days will pass, so will the bright days. You need the strength to stay on the meds when you feel good so you can stay strong and healthy to work out of the dips."" Time has proved her right over and over."

antidepressants,fb2n38e,t1_fb1kd7r,1576454045.0,"I just went through that a few weeks ago! Needed to switch from cymbalta to remeron and it was 3 weeks of horrific symptoms. But not knowing if it was withdrawal from tapering or intolerance of the new drug made it that much more difficult. Best advice I have is find a pharmacist who you trust,  they are more accessible than most doctors and are extremely knowledgeable about these drugs and their effects and can coach you daily!"
