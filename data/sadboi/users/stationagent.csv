You can't make mistakes if you never make any choices at all. They figured just keep everyone. They would have gotten away with too, but only in a solid economy. I see a few opportunites for AEW in this crop, but even bigger names could be freed up soon. I'm sure AEW will be cautious. I see them taking the revival and anyone who can help the women's division, but beyond that they have to be selective. Rusev would be a huge of course.

I've introduced three people to AEW who had no interest in wrestling at all, and the person who sold them all on watching more was Orange Cassidy. I think they will find more attractions and then the baseline quality will make the difference.
