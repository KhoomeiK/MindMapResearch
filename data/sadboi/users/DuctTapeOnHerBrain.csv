zoloft,f5xeuda,t1_f5wzebw,1572539803.0,I am not a big fan of positive thinking. It's never been my thing. I am just trying not to worry about bad things. I appreciate the suggestion though. I am glad that the fb group is working for you. It is comforting to ask questions and also be able to help other people.
zoloft,f5wxkkg,t1_f5uvi47,1572532202.0,"The soonest appt I could get for therapy is Dec and I am guessing it's not going to be the best care. I am dreading therapy actually. Talking about my life makes everything worse and makes me have attacks of anxiety. I can't talk about stressful things without crying. I cry at almost every doctors appt unless the doctor is scary and I am too scared to cry. I just need to do everything I can to avoid anxiety. I need to not sweat the small stuff. I have always been frugal and I try not to spend money because I think of that as being a way to avoid stress, but when it results in a panic attack because my bus transfer is going to run out and I might have to spend an extra 1.75 to get back on the bus.. well I now realize how ridiculous of a worry that is and now that I see how much harm anxiety can do to the body.. I mean I wish I could go back and fix every stupid money-saving anxiety moment I ever caused myself. Not worth it."
zoloft,f5wwl9p,t1_f5uy3ol,1572531756.0,Has a doctor or pharmacist told you how much magnesium and potassium is safe to take per day?
zoloft,f5uohtp,t1_f5umkku,1572476716.0,My doctor wanted me to switch to prozac but then I started to feel better the next day so I stuck with the zoloft. Who knows what kind of side effects I would get from switching to a whole new drug. It could get so much worse. I suppose it could also get better but I am too nervous to change after what I have been through. A lot of people will say that 12.5 is too low of a dose to help but these drugs work so differently for people. Most would say that 12.5 mg is too low of a dose to cause side effects but I really felt them. I might be more sensitive to the drug and maybe the low dose can help. I don't know.. My main issue is anxiety. I didn't have major depression until I starting trying prescribed drugs. Now I am scared that is just part of me. I do feel depressed by my anxiety and chronic pain and life in general now. I feel really scared too. So I don't know if I can go off these drugs. I am more scared than I even used to be.
zoloft,f5ukzui,t1_f5ujwjp,1572475321.0,"I am on week 5 of 12.5 mg. I have had a billion side effects so increasing scares me. Especially since it has given me some days of frightening depression. Like real bad.. And my anxiety got worse for a while too. I am not sure if I am better off on this drug or off of it. I don't know what I would go through if I tried to go off of it, even on the lowest dose. I am terrified of both options. I have had days of calm and days where I feel giddy and days where I want to die and days where I am scared of everything. At this point, I am sticking it out because it might get better and I am scared I will get worse going off it and have to start all over. Join the positive zoloft support group. It's a good group."
zoloft,f5uiecu,t1_f5tpwou,1572473912.0,"How many weeks are you and how many mg? I have had blurred vision on only 12.5 mg. It is fairly common off ssri's, I think. It is amazing to me how doctors act like there are no side effects or they act like they don't know what they are. It's scarier if they truly don't know. Someone suggested I join the zoloft support group on facebook. I did and it has been really helpful in finding people to connect with and ask questions in a more personal way."
zoloft,f5tljvk,t1_f5t817n,1572460921.0,I have seen other people talking about having the exact same issue. I am in touch with my doctor though. Thanks.
zoloft,f5t1ctt,t3_do9t6r,1572448213.0,I have very bad neck pain since starting zoloft. Like a burning pain on the back left side of my neck. I hope it's not from jaw clenching.  Who told you that the neck pain is from jaw clenching?
prozac,f5csx5x,t1_f5c495v,1572140671.0,Thanks for the info!
prozac,f5b7bjy,t1_f598cfx,1572118193.0,Thanks! Turns out my prescription didn't get approved by insurance yet. So I am still taking the zoloft for now. I will see how the next few days go. At first I didn't have an appetite on zoloft but it came crashing back and now I want to eat all the time. I hope prozac doesn't make me even hungrier.  Did you get headaches on prozac? I have heard they cause headaches for a lot of people. Are you sleeping through the night now?
prozac,f58csy7,t3_dbz0a3,1572053607.0,My doctor wants me to switch from zoloft to prozac. I am 4 weeks into zoloft and worried about the switch. How are you doing now? Please tell me everything! Are you glad you switched and why did the doctor want you to switch? What mg were you are and are you on? Thank you! I have not taken my first prozac yet and I don't know what to do.
prozac,f588n32,t1_f568i8m,1572050850.0,"I am on the lowest dose possible. Perhaps she was thinking that if I am reacting this much to the lowest dose that the drug isn't for me. I am not sure what was behind her reasoning. I am on the fence about what to do. Has the prozac helped with muscle stiffness and pain at all? 

My arms feel horrible; like they are filled with panic juice."
prozac,f567r8w,t1_f56661n,1572019704.0,"Thanks! I'm tempted to keep trying the zoloft for another week before switching, to see if I feel better. I'm always such a nervous, emotional wreck at the doctor. She sees me at my worst and maybe prescribed a new one based on how hopeless I seemed. I go back and forth between feeling kind of okay and super hopeless or anxious. She said that the ssri should not make me feel worse but most people say it takes 4 to 6 weeks at least to feel better so it clearly makes a lot of people feel worse and then eventually helps them. I like my doctor a lot and find myself wanting to do what she says but I also keep getting a feeling to keep trying the zoloft. My pharmacist sent me home with more zoloft by mistake and it almost felt like a sign. Ahhh. I don't know what to do. Thanks!"
prozac,f564317,t1_f563jcw,1572018272.0,Thanks. I keep seeing people write about the irritability. I don't want to be snapping at everyone. Mu doc switched me from zoloft after 3 and half weeks and I am worried that I didn't give that one long enough of a try. I hope prozac is the right fit but who can be sure? I am glad you like the change.
prozac,f562ns0,t3_d4tavn,1572017633.0,I just noticed this was a month ago. How was the change for you?
prozac,f562kt4,t3_d4tavn,1572017590.0,"I just got switched from zoloft to prozac, if you want to keep in touch and relate on experience."
Hashimotos,f4qj5cr,t1_f4pvea8,1571753997.0,Please keep me in mind when you find out your results. I hope everything is okay for you. Hopefully this all just goes away for both of us. :)
HealthAnxiety,f4lsxhw,t3_bkvsq5,1571670972.0,I have this too. We should all keep in touch with each other to see if we can find some relief. I started having whole body vibrations in early September. I do have bad anxiety. I have had anxiety for years though and the vibrations are pretty new. It's very uncomfortable and I worry about MS etc.
BFS,f4lrcsk,t3_bzhjar,1571670484.0,I have this exact thing. I feel vibrations all over my body since early September. The last couple nights I have heard a buzzing in my right ear when my ear is on the pillow. I have bad anxiety and was recently prescribed zoloft. The vibrations started before I started taking any meds though.
Anxietyhelp,f4lqrni,t3_c6hwyi,1571670311.0,"I have this too! Please keep in touch with me. I want to know if it ever gets better for you and what you are doing about it. I have had these vibrations since early September. I definitely struggle with anxiety and was recently prescribed zoloft. The vibrations started while I was panicking one night and then they happened again a week later. That caused me to panic so bad I ended up in the emergency room. But sometimes I now feel the vibrations even when I feel calm or think I am calm. It's worst when I lie down to try to sleep. Also, I feel the vibrations after I eat, It feels like there is a heart beating hard in my stomach or my stomach is turning in waves. I feel the vibrations in my feet and legs and arms too. It's very distracting and uncomfortable. I don't know what to do."
zoloft,f4lou61,t1_f4ln9r2,1571669738.0,Thank you! :)
Hashimotos,f4lk9gx,t1_f4judiq,1571668120.0,"The doctors have not put much thought into my issues yet. I was prescribed zoloft for anxiety and the depression I have recently acquired due to everything that is going on. My issues started with a sharp pain in my arch. I don't know what caused the cripplingly sharp, electrical shooting pain in my arch but it's been there since July. The pain often causes panic because it hurts so much and I have not been able to tell if the panic is causing the vibrations or something else. The vibrations just feel like waves inside me. Like my stomach is churning or moving or there is a heart beating inside it. Sometimes I feel the vibrations in my feet and legs and arms and I don't know why. It's worst after I eat and when I lie down. I don't know if I already said that. It's very light but distracting. I have an appt with my PCP on Friday and will ask her to look into it because I am concerned that it is not going away. Hopefully I can get approval for a new MRI. Keep in touch with me. We can be FB friends if you want someone who understand what is going on. Or we can just be friends on here by staying in touch. I don't know what  spinal tap is but it sounds scary. I have an appt to get an EMG in Dec."
zoloft,f4lio9v,t1_f4jwj96,1571667520.0,Okay. No problem. I'm here if you ever want to talk. Thanks for being there for me.
Hashimotos,f4jaoyx,t1_f4ja5fr,1571616036.0,"That's scary. I had an MRI a while back that showed I have a brain cyst. Perhaps that is partly why I have such bad anxiety or maybe not, but I have had the brain cyst for a very long time and the vibrations just started. I hope it's nothing serious. Does it feel like your whole body is just sort of vibrating? I often feel it in my stomach right after I eat and it's worst when I lie down. It often extends into my feet, legs and arms and sometimes it starts there. I sometimes ask my BF if he is moving or if I am vibrating because I feel movement even when I am still. Is that what you experience? Do they have any solutions for you yet? I hope it's not MS."
zoloft,f4j7fjc,t1_f4hzk2q,1571614298.0,I just joined the facebook zoloft group. Thanks for the suggestion. Should we be facebook friends or is this better anonymous? I'm not sure which is better. Send me a message with your name if you want. I completely understand if you want to keep it anonymous.
zoloft,f4getu9,t3_dkfwpw,1571580404.0,Be careful. I have read many stories of people who feel great right after they atop taking it but then they get hit hard with depression and anxiety a bit later. Probably best to taper off slowly at least or talk to your doctor.
zoloft,f4geked,t1_f4e8ik2,1571580284.0,My doc gave me that too. I have been really scared to try it on top of the zoloft. Has your experience been okay with it?
zoloft,f4ge0pa,t1_f4cr20l,1571580166.0,I'm glad it went away for you. I'm hoping none of the side effects are forever ones.
zoloft,f4gdens,t1_f4ct7ck,1571579927.0,"It's mostly just a feeling of vibration that I get. I don't know if that counts as a tremor. I found a bunch of other people with the same problem on reddit last night. Nobody seems to know what it is. The best we all can do is assume it's anxiety. It started about 6 weeks ago. Before I started on any medication. I felt a weird pain and that panicked me because I was thinking I was on my way to being better. The pain made me feel like I was back to square one and I started panicking and crying and then the stomach turning started and it sort of consumed my whole body. Then it happened again a week later and it's been happening on and off since then. I don't know if the pain is causing it or the panic or both. I feel like I don;t know what to do with my limbs. I am always trying to protect them and they end up feeling in the way and heavy a lot, even though they are small and not at all heavy. I can't remember how I used to relax or sit normally. Healthy anxiety is strange. I find myself worrying constantly about health issues that would make life harder, but I often find myself hoping for a health issue that would bring on a quick end. I don't want to die. I want to get better, but I worry that I won't and if I were dead, it's not like I would know. If it were out of my control, it wouldn't be my fault and people couldn't blame themselves or be angry with me. Also, it's not like I have any desire to try something. That sounds terrifying. Thanks for talking all this out with me. People keep telling me not to listen to other people's stories about being on zoloft etc, but truly it is the only thing keeping me kind of okay. I watch this guy on youtube 'Aaron's Anxiety'. He just talks about his experience on zoloft and lexapro and he seems to be doing really well now. He's got a big beard and a friendly face/attitude and he relaxes me. When I feel really alone, sometimes I just put him on in the background, even if I have already watched the videos. That makes me sound really pathetic. It's just that I used to be a reasonably happy introvert. I used to be really good at amusing myself and never bothered to make a lot of friends. Or I didn't know how because of my anxiety. I did the wall of text again.. I am new to reddit.. Ha"
Hashimotos,f4crhjc,t1_eyprq6m,1571532933.0,I am 38 F and started having these issues.  Are you in KY? That's where I am.
Anxiety,f4cqrbt,t3_d6ln3p,1571532672.0,I have this issue too and it's driving me crazy. I got the same google results. I struggle with bad anxiety and recently started taking zoloft. I hope the vibrations go away soon. Sometimes I wonder if they are related to pain. Sometimes it seems that pain triggers the vibrations. Or it could be the anxiety from feeling pain.
zoloft,f4cpz7x,t1_f4cnib7,1571532386.0,"I have hydroxyzine. I feel like it works occasionally but if I take it 2 nights in a row, I don't feel any benefit. i don't get it. I have 10 mg tablets. I am hoping these vibrations are just anxiety, even though that scares me too. I am also worried that it could be a sign of MS or parkinsons or something. I need to stop googling things, but it's hard to do when you're desperate for answers. I got on zoloft for anxiety, Depression was never my issue until very recently. I am definitely depressed lately though, due to my injuries and pain. If those problems went away, I think I would just be dealing with anxiety. I also do melatonin when I can't sleep but it only gives me about 3 hours sleep. I never wanted to be someone who took prescription drugs and I can't believe I am , but I don't know what else to do. I am hoping to be one of those people that finds relief from 25 mg. Ha Maybe not possible but I am really scared of tapering off the higher doses.  I keep forgetting that I can do paragraphs.. My apologies for the walls of text."
zoloft,f4cmka0,t1_f4bvzjo,1571531136.0,What digestive issues did you get? Did they get better when you stopped taking it?
zoloft,f4cl3jp,t1_f4abkq2,1571530574.0,"Wow. Everyone keeps trying to tell me that if I increase my dose that the side effects will be much shorter than the initial side effects. It is frightening to hear that it lasted weeks every time for you. I have been having a lot of trouble sleeping and such high anxiety. The increased depression might be the scariest part and it's having the highest impact on my relationship. I tried Lexapro for a couple days before this one and the side effects seemed scarier, but the dose was slightly higher to start (equiv of 25 zoloft instead of 12.5).  I keep wondering if I should have stuck with that one and cut the pill in half to start. I am just barely at 3 weeks so it sounds like I might just still be in the beginning side effects of  zoloft. I definitely have no interest in sex right now but I also stopped getting my cycle from stress, I think. Do you mind if I ask how old you are now? I am 38. 

Also, have you ever gotten weird body vibrations with your anxiety? Sometimes it feels like my whole body is vibrating, even when I am laying very still. It's maddening and I can't sleep when it happens. I definitely need someone to give me a benzo scrip for occasional extremes."
zoloft,f4aagh8,t1_f48vhpy,1571491373.0,Were you still struggling with an eye problem before the zoloft or do you attribute this blurriness to the zoloft completely? Are you finding benefit from the zoloft? How many weeks in and mg are you on? So far it's been all bad for me and I am on my third week of 12.5 mg. I can't imagine increasing but giving up scares me too. Today I feel so depressed. I woke up like this and I can't shake it. I've lost all my interests. I don't know how to feel good or even okay.  Have you felt these mood swings on zoloft?
zoloft,f48uiof,t1_f48u72w,1571449269.0,My pupils are not dilated. I just have the blurriness. Were your pupils actually dilated?
zoloft,f48ty8a,t1_f48epn8,1571448819.0,Just tonight I started having a problem with my eye. My vision is suddenly blurry. It never has been before.  And the same thing happened with my arms. First it was one and then the other. Are we the same person? I am on my third week of zoloft and am hoping the blurriness is a temporary side effect of that. I'm getting pretty freaked out. Did zoloft give you any blurriness?
zoloft,f48c91o,t1_f488uc9,1571436083.0,"I don't think it's plantar fasciitis. I have that in the other foot and it's nothing like that and the exercises for PF don't seem to help anything. My PT seems to think there is just lingering pain that needs to be worked out but not a problem. When I think there is a new issue, he will say it's just soreness. I hope he knows what he is doing. I hope he realized just how bad the pain is. It seems to get worse when I wear my orthotics so I am thinking about trying to go without them. I hope that doesn't create a new problem but I am at the end of my rope. I am so scared and feel so alone. I have nothing to live for except the people who love me and I can tell I am becoming a burden to even them."
zoloft,f47pywg,t1_f47puai,1571426184.0,"I definitely stopped using my arms too, until they became useless. But it seemed like they were already useless and needed rest so I was so scared of injuring them further. I still am."
zoloft,f47puai,t1_f46r1gg,1571426100.0,"Thanks. I definitely feel like I was getting nowhere with doctors and they didn't really care. My physical therapist seems to think he can help. I hope it's not going to make my pain worse. Sometimes it definitely seems like it is. I have a severe pain in the arch of my foot. It feels like a pinched nerve, like someone is stabbing me. The fact that it won't heal scared me into a panic attack that landed me in the ER. I don't know why this is happening. I didn't do anything to the foot. Nothing that stands out as being a cause of this. My forearms and hands gave out too. That lead to more panic. I have been laying around for months. Things seem to get worse instead of better. I don't know if this ART/Graston ISTM works on feet or whatever I have. My physical therapist doesn't think it's a nerve issue but how can he possibly know. It's so frustrating when people assure you that you will get better but nothing they do is making you feel any better. Thank you for writing to me."
zoloft,f46m3i0,t1_f46derj,1571410593.0,I'm in physical therapy and my therapist keeps saying we can fix the pain. it will just take time. That feels so impossible and I don't know how he can be so confident.
zoloft,f46doi6,t1_f46cp9z,1571407419.0,When did life get this complicated? It's so hard to find the will to keep going and keep trying. I feel like I don't have a choice about that either though. Thanks!
zoloft,f46b7b7,t1_f450vsa,1571406520.0,Thanks. I am on a pretty low dose right now. Been having a hard time on even the 12.5 mg they started me on. I have so much pain though. I am hoping to not have to increase too high to get relief.
zoloft,f3yisqt,t3_dirgme,1571254628.0,I would ask a pharmacist. I have heard that there are a lot of cold medicines that you cannot take with an ssri. You can call your pharmacist and ask over the phone.
zoloft,f3twj6q,t1_f3qq81k,1571147798.0,"First I lost my appetite from anxiety and panic. Also, I think, from trying various medications. I think zoloft continued to take away my appetite for the first week and a half. Then I was suddenly very hungry. I went from not wanting anything and force feeding myself to having to go back to portion control over night."
zoloft,f3qcuzw,t1_f3q033c,1571072894.0,Thank you! I appreciate you saying that. :)
zoloft,f3ppt8a,t3_dho2xo,1571063089.0,I am with you. I am only taking 12.5 mg for 2 weeks now and I don't ever want to increase. I'm still in the side effect phase and hoping this all passes soon. I keep getting so dizzy that I nearly fall over. It's terrifying. Increasing mg does not feel safe. I either want to find out that 12.5 mg is enough or just get off of it. It doesn't seem like 12.5 mg is something you can wean off though. Hard to cut the pills much smaller in any kind of even dose.
zoloft,f37eum4,t1_f36zrrj,1570725050.0,Thanks. I have hydroxyzine but did not feel much relief from it when I tried it previously. I might try it tonight. I keep trying to see if I'll fall asleep on my own and then it's too late.
zoloft,f37eohi,t1_f37a4g6,1570724983.0,"I never smoke or drink and I have cut all junk food. I have never done drugs. Did not have much appetite after my panic attack and it's slowly coming back and I am trying to keep being as healthy as possible. I'm basically doing everything right and still struggling. If I wasn't injured, I truly believe I would be able to handle my anxiety without meds, but these injuries have really taken their toll on my mental and physical health and I don't feel like myself anymore. I realize I am on a small dose  and have considered every possible scenario for what is going on with me. I take detailed notes every day. I never used to clench my jaw, but I do think I have started since taking zoloft. When I woke up today, my teeth hurt. I have been practicing deep breathing when feeling extra anxious. It's surprisingly hard to do. I used to manage my anxiety through exercise, but I have barely left my house in months. I tried Lexapro at 5 mg and had a lot of immediate scary side effects so the doc put me on half the lowest dose of zoloft for that reason. Thanks!"
zoloft,f36kh68,t1_f33atui,1570713644.0,"Thank you! I keep hearing this and so I am trying to stick it out. I am taking daily notes as a reference of how I am feeling.

zoloft,f36k4i2,t1_f33avux,1570713484.0,"I am hoping not to have to increase my dosage to more than the minimum because I don't want to be on this medication forever and would like to avoid having a hard comedown. I am a bit of a mess right now, though, so I may be out of my hands. I am currently take only half the minimum dose 12.5 mg. I am having a hard time with that so going higher really scares me. My doc gave me trazadone for sleep but adding an anti depressant on top of an anti depressant really scares me. But I may have to take it if I can't regulate my sleep soon. I am almost 2 weeks into zoloft and had my first really bad zoloft headache last night. Also some severe dizziness. I almost fell over twice. So I am worried the trazedone will make me fall down. My doc won't do any benzos or harder stuff. I don't have access to a therapist until at least Dec. I don't have the best insurance. Thank you!"

I don't think women like me for some reason. I once moved into a house of 6 or so people. 5 women and 1 man. The man and I quickly became friends. I thought the women there were sort of okay with me.

Ha.  My very best female friend in the world hated me when she first met me in '96. For no reason other than she thought I wouldn't like her. She decided to protect herself by hating me first. I think a lot of women do that. 

I am introverted and self conscious. I will likely never be the type of person to walk up to a stranger and start a conversation. I treat my anxiety naturally and am not interested in ever taking any medication. I actually think the anxiety helps protect me from getting too close to dangerous men and women.  The only woman to ever approach me, while out and about, also seemed like a pimp! Ha. I used to need to carry a little carry-on suitcase around with me. To occasionally carry heavy things to and from home because I don't drive. I think that people thought I was homeless and that made me a target. I am suspicious of everyone now. 

I actually live in a pretty nice part of town. I don't know why there are so many pimps here."
