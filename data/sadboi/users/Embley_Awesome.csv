raisingkids,fqxtvfo,t1_fqxrvjy,1589737780.0,"No problem! Parenting is so hard, I like to try to share whenever I have relevant experience. 

Here's another tactic that worked for us (although we didn't plan it), but your daughter might still be too young. When our daughter bit our son, I shared the story in a group chat with our family and friends. Everyone she saw that day in person and via video chat (including myself and my husband) brought up the biting incident and told her it wasn't okay that she bit her brother. I think she heard it from a total of five or six people that day, and she has never bit him again.

I only ever intended for my husband and I to scold her but I think having aunts and a grandparent do it too really hit home with her.

Anyway, good luck with everything."
raisingkids,fqxh9fo,t1_fqx7o4a,1589732280.0,"Most importantly, anytime she is trying to hurt you, you need to tell her no and then remove her ability to hurt you further, even if that means putting her in a different room for a moment. She needs to learn that hurting people means she can't play with them anymore.

I'm having a harder time with how to deal with the cousins, but I think if it were me I'd just be really on top of her behaviour when she's around them and afterwards when she's acting like them. I think I'd remove her when she's not spitting (whether that be time out in a chair or time out in the house / in a room, whatever works).

The key is to send the message that playtime ends (or pauses) when she is displaying negative behaviours. I hope this helps!"

Parenting,fnl5t0h,t3_g2f807,1587047552.0,"My kids are a year apart, so I ended up introducing screens to my oldest earlier than intended as I was suffering from terrible pregnancy sickness when she was only 5 months old.

Anyway, my oldest is how almost three and although she doesn't spend a lot of time with screens (usually a max of two hours but an average of 30 minutes) she does watch tv and use a tablet. Developmentally she is about 6 months ahead of her peers and in terms of speech, she's even more ahead. I have also noticed that she has learned some things directly from TV (specifically from Blippi on YouTube).

Although she does watch tv, my husband and I choose what she watches and don't give her free reign to change it up (her cousin was watching toy unboxing videos on a tablet for hours a day at this age, so avoiding that), and we limit her time. Plus we are generally right there while they are watching tv to talk them through it and engage them (unless we're cooking dinner or something, of course).

Marriage,fhkpqdg,t3_f3qo2q,1581688906.0,"I'm at a SAHM to two toddlers and it's impossible for me to keep up with the house work. Here's an example of why this is so challenging:
* when I try to load the dishwasher, at least one toddler comes to try to empty the dishwasher I am currently filling, or repeatedly close the door. So usually I just pile them all up until naptime or some other time that they are distracted (like during their limited amount of TV time which doesn't even keep their attention for more than 10 minutes so I have to work quickly)
* when I want to fold laundry, I also have to wait until they are asleep. If I try to fold laundry around them, one will just work on messing up the clothes I've already folded. If I try to leave the room and fold laundry in my room, at least one of them will sit banging on the door and crying the entire time.
* then I try to put the laundry away, and my kids just keep closing the drawers (while my hands are still in them) and almost slamming the drawers on their own fingers.
* if I try to tidy up toys, my son will take the bins I just filled with toys and immediately dump them somewhere in the house. 

That's just an example of me trying to complete a couple of chores around my kids. So basically, I have to do dishes, laundry, food prep, and much much more during the just over an hour of naptime (and that's if they actually both go to sleep), and then the rest has to wait until they are in bed.

Anyway, I hope this helps you to better understand why it's so difficult to complete household chores with small kids around.

Edit: as others have mentioned when you factor in prepping meals and snacks, Diaper changes, trips to the potty, the supervision little kids require, etc. It really doesn't leave much time for housework anyway."
