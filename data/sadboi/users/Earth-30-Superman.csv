TBI,fnln09a,t3_g2bfes,1587056298.0,"I had a TBI when I was nine, I was hit by a car and flew 60 ft up in the air, landing head first on the ground. Dying, then put in a medical induced coma for three weeks. I was not supposed to live, I was supposed to die, or either be a vegetable for the rest of my life. 

That being said, it’s a journey. A harsh one. I’m still learning and adapting to it all. Before my TBI, I was an athletic kid, I was fast and easy going. After, I couldn’t play sports anymore. If I got hit on the head again, I’d die. Anyways, there is more to my story, but it gets harder, then easier depending on the route you go. How you handle it. Want to handle it. It’s difficult as all hell—to have an abrupt stop in a path you were already going, then reworking with a sudden new one. 
Anger, defeat is a sign of it. You are not alone nor will you ever be alone. 

I suggest trying to meditate. It helped me. It takes practice, but the outcome is incredible. Read on the brain, that also helped me understand each part and the issues of my own, turning my weaknesses into strengths or then replacing them with something else. 

It’s a long journey, Friend. It is also a tough one. No one will understand you for a long time, so during this time, take the time first to understand the new you. 

If you need to talk, just message me!"
