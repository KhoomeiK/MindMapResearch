My girlfriend has given me a stronger will to live and shown me that things can get better. I don't have to suffer and that she'll be there to be my emotional support when I need someone the most.

If it was just sex, what if I'm not good at it and then we just stop talking to each other. What if that's all she sees me as and doesn't really care about me, am I making a fool out of myself. After that point you feel yourself going soft and then you worry about that until your just sitting there with a limp dick and she is wondering what she is doing wrong.

Kept on losing my erection and not being able to get one until me and her talked through it. She told me how much did care about me and that my friend was an ass.

Any little fault I made she would utter lay into me and make me feel like I was an absolute piece of trash. It made coming home after work a nightmare as I had to walk on eggshells around her because I was so afraid of setting her off and having her yell at me.

I cried a lot, I felt like if I wasn't so garbage she wouldn't have to yell at me. Then after a while, I realized it wasn't me it was her, we went to a therapist and in the nicest way possible she told my wife that she was surprised I dealt with the abuse for as long as I had. 

She got better for a while then slowly everything went back to being my fault and I just couldn't do it anymore. We separated, she moved halfway across the nation and we are working out the divorce agreements now. It was hard at first, nearly destroyed me, felt super low and made to feel like I had destroyed a beautiful marriage.

We are both in a better place now, she is dealing with her issues and I've found someone who genuinely appreciates me. I've got other problems that I'm dealing with but it's nice to know that no matter how stressful things get my girlfriend has my back.

It's not like I wasn't able to perfectly afford the situation before my separation. It isn't like I am almost finished my degree and have the opportunity to advance myself into a more lucrative career. It's not like my spouse left me in a situation where regardless of where I go the debt would follow me. It's not like I'm making progress to pay off these debts and will be back on track to getting my life together before the year closes.

Look I know I'm being kind of an asshole here but this whole situation isn't so much of a black and white kind of painting. There are many reasons in which I have decided to stay here instead of moving off to some other place. Right now I'm just trying to make the best out of a bad situation in hopes that in the end I can make a better life for myself.

Mine is estimated to be around $5k so I am going to use that money to get out of this situation. It doesn't really matter where I move, the debt I have will follow me where ever I go. I have some family here as well as friends that I don't want to leave and I plan on going back to finish school once fall comes around.

I have paid off a few things in the last few months and I am trying to keep this train rolling. I am going to get myself out of this situation and having goals and keeping to them gives me  confidence that this situation is temporary.

Currently crawling myself out of this hole one day at a time. I am hoping in a few months, after I get some more of these debts paid off, I can get myself back into an apartment. The only thing that has me worried is that's my work is going to be closing down in a few months and I'm not too sure I'm going to be able to find another job.

If I stay until the place closes I get a severance but I'm still worried that I won't be able to find a place to work before that money dries up. This job worked out for me so well It just bums me out It's closing they provide throw out food for me so I don't have to spend money on groceries. Just being a general friendly environment for me to hang out before and after work has been healthy for me mentally.

AskMen,fcvxdew,t3_ehmkp5,1578012255.0,"I'm 28 year old due that has split from my wife of 9 years earlier this year. Living a city the doesn't quite feel like home and I'm just trying to figure myself out. I have a great circle of friends that I wouldn't trade for the world.

The Good: Started running again, lost 45 lbs in the process and completed my goal of finishing a marathon. Then I started weightlifting and got back about 25 lbs in muscle over the later half of the year. Also in the home stretch of the year I got with a girl that I work with who is WAY out of my league and that has been super nice.

The Bad: The process of the divorce has left me strapped for cash and we just got told a few weeks back that due to a merger our grocery store was going to close. I'm sure I'll be able to find another job, but I don't know if I'll be able to find one that pays as well as this one. Also the girl I'm with doesn't really like to hang out unless we are having sex, which is cool but maybe I'm just stupid for thinking it was something more.

The Ugly: My ex moved back to her home state with our kids so I can only FaceTime with them for about 30 mins a day. It really hurts to see them growing up without me, but they are also happier then they were when we all lived together so I try to count it as a positive. Also all my money is going into my car and child support for my kids, no money for an apartment so I'm currently living in my car. It sucks and no one in my circle knows, but I fear the girl I'm with will find out and dip.

So yeah that's my current situation, my goals are to just stay alive for one, finish my degree and get myself into the gaming industry. I'd like to get back into an apartment, but with all the bills she left behind that will probably have to be a 2021 thing. 

As for the girl that I am with, I don't really know. I really do like her and I'm pretty sure she feels the same, but at this point I'm just going to ride this train until it stops.

inthesoulstone,f8o7psd,t1_f8o76ii,1574666432.0,"They tend to be the poster child for what I don't really like in marvel movies. Namely weak villains  that barely have a screen presence, scenarios or story beats which can be interesting but are never really utilized. Also humor for the most part that falls flat (most referring to ant man and wasp here.) 

The section of the films that I like are the Luis story bits, but they aren't enough to carry these movies. I do like the cast for the most part, the exception being Michelle Pfeiffer but that is because they give her nothing to work with."
inthesoulstone,f8o1dqu,t1_f8njfi3,1574659161.0,"It's not fact though, it's a matter of taste and opinion.

I won't down vote people who I disagree with even if I get tanked for mine."
inthesoulstone,f8o16n4,t1_f8nxcvl,1574658963.0,"Hey that's a fair assessment. I like Ragnarok quite a lot, but the Asguard scenes kinda threw the pacing off as well as the sour send off of two of the warriors three. I liked the dynamic between Thor and Hulk, but I also wish there was a bit more for Banner to do in the film. 

Banner as a whole seems to get the shaft as far as screen time and overall character development, most of which seems to happen off screen. Then again the attempt in Age of Ultron was a bit clumsy in my opinion so maybe it was for the best."

All of these movies have moments in them that I like and appreciate, but the farther down the list you go the less these moments can save the film as a whole for me.

Edit: I guess I shouldn't be surprised by the down votes, but I was just giving my personal list. Would like to see those who downvoted to at least post your list, would like to know what films others hold over others."
