queensuniversity,fqz8jnz,t1_fqyytjr,1589762124.0,"I hope you and your class will be on campus as well! I just think this year’s first years are going to have to face a lost of unfortunate circumstances, and I don’t know if it’s best to get your hopes up about it.

There are still things to get excited about, like being a member of the Queen’s community (which is very tight knit, even at a distance) and you’ve still made it into a great post-secondary institution! I don’t mean to minimize your experience, but there are some positives to focus on!!"
queensuniversity,fqywx7x,t1_fqytasm,1589755965.0,"Queen’s hardly generates a profit from residence when you compare their other lines of revenue. International students pay over $40,000 in tuition every year (not just first year). There’s about 3000 international students at Queen’s, so that’s $120,000,000 right there. Yes, the money goes into services and support for those students, but it’s not like they have to form from the ground up services and assistance programs. That’s where the money is.

When you consider the cost of upkeep (i.e. beds, furniture, building integrity), custodial staff, maintenance staff, front desk staff, hospitality services (i.e. your food) and staff, campus security, facilities staff, student government/student staff, not to mention the slew of damages incurred that must be constantly repaired during the year, the $15K they get from 3500 first year students just doesn’t compare ($52,500.000). 

I should add that the university is also losing money in not opening the residences for the Summer hotel accommodations they offer, as the money they make here doesn’t really have to be put back into damages (it’s mostly respectful adults and children with parents, not alpha teens punching out ceiling tiles) or student services offered by most of the support staff mentioned earlier."

Sounds pretty inconsistent."
confession,fqljt5c,t3_gjjrzs,1589459935.0,"I think in order to harass someone so heavily after an interaction requires the vilification of them. Like you have to turn them into a purely negative and hateable person in order to do that. How is that any better than what this customer did? They judged you off of one piece of information, and then you did the exact same.

Sounds like a majorly missed opportunity for self-reflection and growth. The fact that you’re still buttering your own balls about this is a tribute to that. Grow up."

she was abused a ton as a child and young adult, (parentally, domestically) so everyone thinks her behaviour is justified — which of course means i am family-enemy #1. and i texted the older sister that basically raised myself and 2 other siblings, and she ignored me. 

today is a fucking ass day, thanks for taking another one from me, mom."
