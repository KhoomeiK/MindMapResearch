Even at the vets office they never said otherwise. But, either way, she is so cute and crazy and fits right in."

AmItheAsshole,fcsr4zd,t1_fcsqrjf,1577923004.0,I agree! They should start teaching it in sex ed
AmItheAsshole,fcsoo7h,t1_fcsfwru,1577921239.0,I was just always embarrassed. Growing up that was the thing to be clean shaven all the time and if you weren‚Äôt you were gross and being judged. But hair is good for the body. It helps protect against all the bacteria and what not that what‚Äôs to get into your skin. Learned grown men and not boys don‚Äôt care if you have hair or not. That was a relief lol
AmItheAsshole,fcso92u,t1_fcrbn00,1577920947.0,Just the hair growing back. Can get ingrown hairs and it itches like crazy in a place is not lady like to itch lol

He laughed and said he‚Äôs not there for the hair he‚Äôs there to make sure I‚Äôm okay. Haven‚Äôt fully shaved since üôåüèª

therapy,f9exrog,t3_e4s2gi,1575254306.0,"Start with what you‚Äôre comfortable with. Everything doesn‚Äôt have to be unleashed in one appointment. 
Remember to breathe and don‚Äôt feel embarrassed about your thoughts or feelings. They are yours to feel and work through and that‚Äôs exactly why therapist are there for you! Hope all goes well and stick with it, even when you don‚Äôt feel like going and talking. I‚Äôve been feeling that way lately but make myself go and always feel better afterwards."
