I wasn't very much at all, and I definitely remember that this album was one of the first ones that she got me really into.  Oasis and Blur were kind of a hard sell for me at the time, but I loved this right away.

I'm also a drummer, and listening to Danny's playing on this made a concept click for me that I've found so helpful and exciting, and think about all the time when I'm playing.  Not to get too music theory on you, and it's hard to describe in typing, but his drumming always has an underlying pulse of 16th notes running through it.  Even when he's playing something straightforward and simple, you can tell those 16th notes are running through his head all the time, and they bubble up into his hands from time to time.  It makes the fills super natural and just makes everything push forward and gives it all the propulsive energy that I love about it."

A couple of those people were actually dancers, and asked my brother what this dance was.  ""The Alley Cat!"" he said.

Soon after, the dance studio those two attended had a banquet.  After dinner there was some dancing, and the attendees were asked if anyone knew the Alley Cat and could demonstrate it.  You see where this is going.

Those poor poor girls jumped up, ""We know the Alley Cat!"", and proceeded to do Chris's version.  The aftermath was awkward."

Above all, make sure that while you're doing this research, you have the mind of wanting to understand it on it's own terms.  Don't try to look for ways that these things are evil or immoral.  Understand first, then figure out if it's really harmful, or just different.  Those two things can be hard to discern sometimes.

I bet your daughter won't give you the names for these things because she thinks that you aren't coming from a place of trying to understand and learn about her interests, you are trying to find evidence of why it's evil.  If you stress to her that you will use neutral sources to look things up, or prove to her that she can explain them to you and talk without you flipping out. Understand that she is different from you.  Trust her.  It can be hard, but it's worth it.

I don't think the ACLU is arguing against a mandatory quarantine.  It's not an enforceable thing right now anyhow, it's not like the police are detaining anyone.  They are specifically arguing about the constitutionality (specifically the 4th amendment) of giving the police the ability to pull you over because of your license plate.  

Like I said, I'm not necessarily against this.  The ACLU isn't even suing or taking any action/actively trying to stop it.  They are questioning it.  They want the state to be careful and accountable for possibly violating the rights of citizens.  

I understand the argument for suspending constitutional rights during a crisis.  But that's not what they are arguing.

AmItheAsshole,flalnzm,t3_fniztj,1584986323.0,NTA.  He wants you to punish your son into going to see him.  WTF.  Don't feel bad.  He can die angry about it.

zoloft,fkyunu4,t3_fli23f,1584656516.0,"I asked my doctor, he said there‚Äôs no real danger, but explained that alcohol can block the effectiveness of the medicine. I found it to be true.  I didn‚Äôt go crazy when drinking, didn‚Äôt get extra drunk off of less alcohol or anything, but along with a hangover, definitely felt off the next day or two.  So just know that if you feel symptoms coming back the day or so after having a good amount of liquor, it‚Äôs not permanent, and just part of the price of a drinky night.  NBD."
