CysticFibrosis,fpl0mzv,t3_ge0m7z,1588704291.0,I didn't have any pain when I started but I already had some scaring on my liver from a few courses of psedomonas and MBA treatment and the trikafta has added to the damage unfortunately. Not massively for the first year but it will add up.

Please be very proud of yourself and it's okay if you think about it, but just tell someone and you'll keep going. I haven't attempted in around 7 years now but it's still a struggle. Well done and I hope you have many great years ahead."
