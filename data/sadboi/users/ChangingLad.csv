pornfree,etqtap3,t3_c7rfc7,1563101292.0,"Relapsed after 16 days. It was a CRAZY short journey filled with positivity and happiness, but thoughts of my injuries still not healing after a month got me depressed and my mind started filling with thoughts of porn. 

Number 1 tip: The second you think about porn, think about something else that makes you happy."

NoFap,es95nkf,t3_c6iznp,1561727965.0,"Yes it is harder for a teen to stop. If you're 14 you still have years until you realize you fucked up and wasted thousands of hours of your life fapping to porn. Someone who is much older, like 25, can't afford to waste anymore time. They MUST retake their life unless they don't really give a shit about life."

NoFap,erxls3s,t3_c4i83j,1561387970.0,"Bruh this is what i've been telling people here on noFap. Its ok to relapse. As long as you never give up the noFap lifestyle. you WILL continue to rewire your brain to want less and and less porn. I started off fapping every day and with a year of noFap, I can go 6-7 days without craving porn until I reset. However if you're looking for a relationship, it is NOT okay to relapse. Accumulate your sexual energy and use it for things that make you a better person. Use it to workout, exercise, learn new hobbies. Work on yourself and make yourself representable and then find a relationship."
depression,errgexe,t3_c1ug9l,1561169755.0,haha miss the times when I wanted to be a youtuber at 11  years old and I would get so happy uploading videos. Now at 17 i just wanna tell everyone to fuck off and be myself and not think about anything ever
NoFap,epnn1on,t3_bv4yyx,1559330042.0,"You will NOT beat years of addiction in a single try. When I first started off noFap I could handle 1 day, and months and months, it slowly became 2 days, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days. Almost a year in, I have gone from fapping 365/365 days to calculating about 75/365 this year. As time goes by, your porn addiction will weaken as you continue to deny it."

NoFap,eoguz82,t3_brmqft,1558566323.0,"> What I learned about nofap is that you need to persevere

Yes. Believe it or not, if you persevere your streaks will only go up. dozens of 1 day streaks, then dozens of 2 days, then dozens of 3 days.. and so on."
