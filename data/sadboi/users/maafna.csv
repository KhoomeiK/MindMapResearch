CPTSD,fr0p8pz,t1_fqx4vlt,1589803089.0,"What's your location? and how old are you? I'd love to follow you too :)

My boyfriend and I... last night I was sure we would break up and we both said things I couldn't see how we could go back from. So either we do and actually learn something or we break up. Maybe this is finally the time that I learn to be single while I'm not in the midst of a horrible depression...

He's great in many fronts and I learn from him but Jesus, he has some wounds, and he gets in fight mode and won't notice it, I feel unheard and disrespected, and on several occasions, I've said something hurtful (the last was ""this isn't the man I fell in love with, this is a disgusting and fearful man"" and then he latched on to that and was dysregulated for hours, one moment he's calm enough to come talk to me then not. So yeah, it doesn't sound healthy, does it?

I'd feel shame writing this because I assume you read this and say, ""fuck, isn't it better to be alone?"" and maybe it would be, at least on some parts. But I do enjoy being with him when it's good and I do learn and like you said, fuck is it expensive to be single... I don't want to stay with him because of money, gross, but I can't pretend I don't have financial concerns. But when he acts like last night? I can't imagine that he'd help me if we break up. But when he's calm he says of course he will. I can't trust that, though. Worst case I'll have to ask my parents for money.

It's just that I'm not sure how long I can keep with online work. I was just told someone couldn't assign a task to me and I freaked out that this website kicked me out because I'm not a good enough translator.

I'm doing a lot of free work now with this food distribution and  I want to get involved with a company someone we met set up about psychedelics in Asia. Of course I hope this turns into something eventually but I'm also really doing it because I believe in these two things. So, that's new for me. And trusting myself that I can actually get the job done. And not freak out from stress. And yes, moving to a new country and trying new things to feel better when some people are too scared.

Right now I can't see myself moving somewhere new because if my boyfriend and I split I would probably want some familiarity for awhile... if it happens soon... otherwise who knows, maybe I will want to start over.

I have friends back ""home"" (especially one who is now like my spiritual friend and I am so lucky to have her) and my brother's wife is pregnant, but I am SCARED to move back. I totally feel what you mean about childhood holding me back. Like, my father says I ""just need to believe in myself"", ok cool, but he doesn't understand how they never actually taught me to do that? In fact I was told that I was smart so I ""should"" do well in school (despite moving to a country where I didn't speak the fucking language AND move form play-focused kintergarden to sit-down first grade at the same freaking time) and that tutors and psychologists are for weak people because people have to help themselves... ok dad I'm 9 how do you want me to help myself....

So I get told I'm smart and have potential but it's just such a challenge to be emotionally regulated. You don't snap back that easily from being suicidal as a child. I! Neither of us! I'm not sure what the specifics are, but I know I definitely don't give myself enough credit. And who do I need to prove myself to by being ambitious with a Master's and career? Sure, I wish thinking about money didn't put me on the edge of a panic attack, but I am where I am...

worldnews,fqsg8gl,t1_fqsf5ox,1589606429.0,"So... his parents don't set proper boundaries and follow-up, don't consult a specialist, and yet you assume a specialist wouldn't help and the kid needs to be ""disciplined"" with hitting?

They don't need to give the kid their credit card. It's probably easier for them because they work and don't want to spend the energy, but of course they're creating a bigger proper in the long run.

And it doesn't sound like they ""befriended""him either. Being friends with someone is also listening to them, having an open and honest communication, and yes, setting boundaries. Letting your kid do whatever they want isn't being their friend or being loving - it's being a neglectful parent.

The kid has a video game addiction for a reason. It's filling a void - and that void can also be filled by genuine human connection. 

This isn't about the kid needing ""tough love""- he needs love, period. 

So yes, there are many specialists who consult on how to parent or how to deal with the discomfort of an angry child, or there are family therapists who can see the whole family together and improve their dynamics. 

Again, if you would consult someone about physical health why not mental health and the future of your children? There is no shame in not knowing everything - no one does. What is shameful is being so set in your ways and opinions you refuse to consider other viewpoints and consult other people.

I can tell you I was depressed as a kid, I skipped school, when I was forced to do something of course I did it, but my parents hitting me never really taught me anything. In might have gotten me to do what they wanted at that moment, but it also caused me long-term harm. The same outcomes could have been achieved in other ways."

Has behavoirs he doesn't like? He has so much shame that he'd rather pretend it's not there, or he says he doesn't know what to do about it. So I'm basically going to demand we start being active about it or I leave. It will be hard on me emotionally and financially but I also know I have to start putting up firmer boundaries and work to create the relationship I want and not settle for less.
So, if we break up, I'll probably have to be a lot more careful about money. Maybe move to a cheaper place - I was thinking of trying Sri Lanka, but that would mean starting all over again.

I was introduced to something called Human Design. I don't fully believe in it, officially speaking, but it did strike a chord with me as it highlighted things I've struggled with all my life. Basically, there's some website you put your birth date and hour and it gives you a personality chart with a million variables, one of them is that everyone is one of four ""energy types"", with one of them being 70% of people. Those people have reliable, consistent energy, and they're kind of the ones who are more ""meant to"" be workers and parents, while the 3 rarer types have different roles. 
If you have a minute and are interested, could you let me know which type you are and if you identify with it?

She is obviously biased, but she was kind of like ""I don't recommend having kids, it's a lifetime of anxiety"". She admitted she wasn't really interested in having kids to begin with, but she obviously really loved her son. 

My boyfriend has a happier story, he loves his daughter and she adores him, but they live in different countries, the love he has for her isn't enough for him to live in a country he doesn't want a future in. And he told me that if she asked, he'd tell her not to have a kid or to put it off (she's 23) and focus on herself. But he also speaks about how cosy it can be with children climbing in bed with you, and jokes around with me about having a kid. 

So, yeah... it's really nuanced. 

But I don't feel there's anything missing in my life that kids can fill, so I won't do it now. I hope I will be strong enough to deal with the eventual regret if and when it comes."

the negatives outweigh those things to me. And I don’t want to be driven by negative things to bring a human into this world.

But then here I am again, back at anxiety central trying to feign excitement for my pregnant friend although I feel disgusted, sad, jealous and left behind.

I feel this. I wish I didn't, but when I hear of someone else who is having or planning to have kids, I think, ""oh, you too?"" I feel disappointed and a fear of being left behind, the only one who ends up not having kids. Of course, I know there are older people without kids, but it's also a matter of meeting them and getting along."

Fasting before taking mushrooms helps a lot too. Nothing to throw up and it's a lot ""cleaner"" feeling.

Just would like to point out there isn't really a way to do this legally. You cannot work in Thailand legally online and pay taxes. I'm sure many people would do this if it were an option. But the only way to do it is to set up a fake business and ""hire"" a Thai."
