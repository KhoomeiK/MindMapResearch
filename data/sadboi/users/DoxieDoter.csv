As attendance was impossible to take not making it to class bc of lack of motivation wasn’t an issue and I’m ok reading by myself. As long as the class was straight from the book it was fine. Actually my chem prof wrote the book for our class and lecture was him literally reading from the text and if someone asked a question he would say read the text. The exams were night exams. Got an A in that one :)

AmItheAsshole,fiok4ix,t3_f8pj8i,1582584846.0,"NTA at all I honestly have no words for the so called “friends”. Seriously who does that!?! I would never ask someone to throw me a party just because they had more money than me. As much as it sucks to lose these people as friends they probably weren’t true friends anyway. You are still incredibly young and one never knows what turns life can take. Growing up my family was upper middle class. My father was self employed and my mother was a “domestic engineer” (fancy way of saying housewife if not know) while I was in college my mother was diagnosed with metastatic breast to bone cancer. Back in the early 80s when my mom first had breast cancer they weren’t as knowledgeable and told her after 5 years she didn’t need to worry so when it returned 15 years later with a vengeance it was too late. Anyway we had health insurance but it didn’t include prescription coverage as it was never an issue and we were a relatively healthy family. 3 years battling cancer at over 10,000 a month in medications really added up and we almost lost everything. Honestly I’m impressed that you have the know how to not waste at your age."
