feel bad ➡ binge ➡ guilt ➡ purge ➡ relief

Then goes back to feeling bad. The professor said we need to stop this cycle somewhere and this following thing is how we usually see the most improvement on. We stop the binge with one sentence he said.

You absorb about 50% of the calories from carbs while they're in your mouth. 

That's where the digestion begins. And carbs is usually what we binge on. So if you've binged and then purge, you only lose about half the calories from it, even if that much.

The thought is really triggering at first but it helped me stop binging for a while."

Out of the ones I've read of that list, Dracula was definitely the most striking one for me.

Bram Stoker's Dracula though, that was one of the best books I've ever read. Amazing from start to finish."

AskDID,fqzz1ot,t3_glouib,1589779069.0,"I have conflicting feelings about this. I trust you're well meaning but I really don't think someone who doesn't have DID should write someone with DID, since you would never be able to fully understand how it is, like I wouldn't be able to understand being healthy.

But if you're really adamant in writing, watch a lot of videos about DID and ask everything you're unsure of. Also remember: people don't suddenly develop this disorder. The signs, symptoms and habits are there. For example: I've been talking to my alters for as long as I can remember, and they'd respond. I didn't know other people didn't have this kind of thing. If you write someone who was healthy and suddenly comes to work saying they're called Alex now and the host is dead, you will have done a terrible job.

Again, I don't think you should be writing someone with DID at all, but if you must, at least make it as accurate as humanly possible."

I lived with my nmother for 12 years in total, I lived with my grandparents before when she was out and about living her life. I admired her for going to uni and working at terrible places before, but now I see she just wanted to live her own life and would probably prefer having my grandparents look after me for as long as I needed, while she was off doing her own thing. Through the years there has been stuff she does that I just can't accept, they'd make a long list. I'd try to talk to her and she wouldn't change. I'd try to fight with her and she wouldn't change, and she'd fight back worse than I did. I'd lastly write her a wall of text or a long letter explaining what she's doing wrong, and then she'd stop doing said things for a while, until going back to her old ways.

I'm currently not able to cut contact with her, but when I'm able to, I really want to just cut her off. She's not going to change her ways. She's not going to become the mother I want, even the mother I deserve. She's going to be real nice for a while and then start with the abuse again.

It sucks to be in a situation like this. We didn't deserve to have these kinds of parents. But I want you to know that we don't have a responsibility towards them to keep them in our lives in spite of everything they did and continue doing. Everything they did was their CHOICE, and if they chose to hurt us over and over, than it's completely justified that we choose to keep them away."

The people who matter the most to me are the nicest and most logical and compassionate ones, and if they learned everything she did to me she would pretty much be shunned from the family, or at least would have a lot of explaining to do. The least I can do is fucking talking to SOMEONE about everything she put me through.

I'm also trying to mildly trigger her to go to someone that actually matters, who would then try to mediate a peace between us. I'm hoping she'd go badmouth to grandma about me. That would give me the green light to go tell the aforementioned people that matter and tell them about everything she's done to me in the twelve years I lived alone with her."

explainlikeimfive,fqx9wze,t3_glgge5,1589728706.0,"We usually eat packaged goods that are really high in sodium already. There's very little need to get any more after you have your regular meals, since we add salt to everything we cook as well. Sodium is in pretty much everything we consume, since all plants and animals have sodium in their cells as well. 

Salt needs water to be passed through the body. It needs to be a solution. So every bit of salt you eat causes water to be retained. Too much salt passing through your blood vessels causes too much water to be passed through as well, which caused high blood pressure, because there's literally too much water in your blood vessels. When this happens regularly, it wears down your heart, because your heart is a muscle and it has to beat the existing blood pressure in your vessels each time it contracts to be able to send blood through. Your heart can't just grow like a skeletal muscle does, so high blood pressure causes your heart muscle to wear off, new tissue to grow that's basically just more weight on your heart, and if you continue this too long your heart just gives out.

There's also this aspect that if you're eating something high in sodium, you're probably also eating things high in sugar and cholesterol, high in calories. Which results in obesity and diabetes, as well as fatty deposits forming in your blood vessels, which prevent enough blood to pass through the vessels, which causes the cells that need that blood to die.

That's pretty much why doctors tell people to eat less sodium!"

I'm not trying to underestimate how serious your problem is, but I can't tell you ""oh you have an eating disorder"" because I'm not qualified. However there's nothing stopping you from joining communities of people who suffer with it and are hopefully recovering from it, for a place to share your struggles. 

I will just suggest this: stay out of ed communities on tumblr and instagram because I've been there and those will just make you sicker. If you want a community of helpful people, this subreddit is really good for that.

Also, if you were to talk about your struggles around eating honestly, your counsellor should be able to be more help. You need to do it HONESTLY, because unless you tell them how serious it is, they won't be able to be of full help."

What I mean to say by this is, dissociation might make it impossible for you to reach those specific goals. I know for me those things have barely improved.
However if you get to know the other alters on an individual level, let them have the control of the body while you're observing etc. you can recognise them when they're influencinh stuff like your gestures, and you might be able to know a thought sounds kind of like a thought that person would have.

EatingDisorders,fqtbsgc,t3_gksno8,1589635561.0,"The problem with eating disorders is that they are always there. Kati Morton explains it as they hide somewhere in your brain and when you're under stress, they come back wearing another dress. We may be doing really really well, but we always have to be careful and realise exactly where we stand from those ed thoughts, and if they're getting too close, we need to take precautions.

There's no reason to feel shame. A pandemic is a serious thing, and we as a species need socialisation so the lack of it makes us feel even worse. Johann Mari has this theory that lack of social contact is a reason why we develop depression and anxiety, because everything aside from our outer brain layer is the same as it was when our species lived in Africa. If you got seperated from your tribe back in the hunter-gatherer times, chances were you were going to die. Either by hunger or thirst, or by some animal hunting you. There's nothing more natural than you feeling depressed and anxious, he says.

My first advice would be to tell a friend, and your therapist if you're still in contact. Tell them about it. Talk about what's bothering you, what thoughts go through your head. Talk about the lack of control. You will see that pretty much everyone feels that way currently. Sharing your quarantine troubles and hearing how their mental health has been affected might help, but also them showing compassion for you will help.

Second advice: if you can, stay with a friend or your boyfriend. I don't know the conditions around you or quarantine rules in your country but if possible, stay with someone else until your mental health gets a bit better. This goes back to the idea of being with someone else would feel better, but also if you have to eat in front of someone else, you might feel more compelled to eat properly. Or even just eating your meals when they do would have you eat at least some stuff few times a day.

I'd also advise to have a journal, not to log in food or anything, but to rant your feelings in. I use my journal to write in it as if I'm in a therapy session, since not being able to see my therapist is taking a toll on me. I've seen significant improvement using a journal. Not as good as a therapist, but still pretty good. 

Just know that you're not alone. A lot of people feel a lot more stressed and like their mental health deteriorating because of the situation we are in. It's important to realise that a lot of things are out of our control, and it's OKAY. You don't have to be in control of something. It's okay to feel stressed and lonely, because that's what we are. It's okay to have your emotions. You don't have to keep it together or stay strong or anything. Kati Morton has good videos on youtube about Covid anxiety, and even she is really anxious and doesn't know how to process everything despite being a therapist. It's okay to not be in control. Things will be uncertain for a really long time, with a new kind of normal for everyone. The only way out of this is through. Stay safe ♥️"

I am finally at the heavier end of a healthy weight but I have an eating disorder from all the ""fat ass"" comments from my uncles. My grandmother, very concerned, would always say ""you need to put some less food in that mouth, you're going to be ill when you grow up"" but she did it so often. Because of her at my worst I know i haven't eaten for days at a time.

Nmother when she was around never EVER told them to stop or support me. Like I understand people from a small town not knowing how to support me to live a healthier lifestyle, but this woman is a teacher who also did masters in childhood psychology, and she NEVER helped me be healthier, physically or mentally. But after years and years of this, she then started to yell at my now old grandmother for putting me down and cooking unhealthy food, as if that's what made me fat in the first place. We only ate homecooked, and they were healthy Mediterranean food btw, it was emotional eating of junk food I did as a kid that made me gain. She was still making it about her own though because that didn't happen until I had to get treatment for insulin intolerance or depression. She was paying for them. 

Even now at 26 I don't know how big girls can be so confident and stylish.

I wanted to go to a doctor and I told nmother several times I wanted to go but didn't have the energy. I didn't expect her to do anything but now I think that she should have been more anxious about it because I literally couldn't turn from side to side and let her know about it as well. Didn't think to take me to a doctor. After two months I was able to go one day and turns out I had a vitamin D deficiency, so as severe as it was it has been very easy to turn it around. But I spent two months in bed and she wasn't concerned."

I have a really good understanding of how many calories something would be so I turn to that if I need to. I barely do anything now that I've graduated and it's quarantine time, but I just use my BMR and then some extra exercising. So far it's slow but I am losing weight and losing fat to be exact. My measurements have been dropping significantly since January. Whatever works is good I'd say."

AskDID,fq8fbso,t3_ghb93k,1589164922.0,"I've been aware of a couple of them since I was very young. My first memory of talking to them is from age 7. In middle school our diary has entries signed by them. However being aware of an alter's existence and knowing something is wrong are two very different things, especially if you're in a neglective abusive household. In university after several years of immense stress, followed by a massive breakup followed by several years of depression and anxiety, my head was bursting with activity. It felt like I had a beehive in my head because I could hear all other alters' every single thought and speech. I think there were around 26 alters at the time. I figured it must be ADHD because my mom and grandmother has ADHD and I showed other symptoms. Seeked and got the diagnosis. However the medicine they gave me made me really really sick mentally, so they tried to figure out what else was wrong and that's when I mentioned the voices in my head and some other symptoms. Assessments failed because some therapists are extreme assholes here. I researched on my own, found some sources, then some friends, then all capable alters came to me and introduced themselves. Took a year for me to heal enough from the therapy experience to seek help again, then I found my current therapist and got my formal diagnosis. Fast forward four years and we have 19 alters altogether with fragments and dormant, about 5 active alters that contribute to everyday life, some big traumas have been processed and we're going strong against all odds.

AskDID,fq5aes8,t3_ggpi72,1589097984.0,"Heyyyy welcome to my territory because I have a very recent experience with this, getting three alters (one fragment) in three months of abuse, from an adult, to us, an adult.

What I would look for if something like that happened again would be behaviour that I'm not familiar with to happen, as if an alter I don't know is coconscious. This can be a different accent, a different walking style, a reaction that you wouldn't give, or in my case something as big as a catatonic episode.

Another thing I might look for is thoughts that are seemingly misplaced. They might sound like they come from me or someone I know, but out of character. Might be self depricating or upset thoughts, might be the same sentence being repeated over and over again.

In our case one alter just came to full existence really soon after the abuse started because he had a lot of apathy towards the situation, while another alter took about thred months fully forming after the abuse ended. The fragment also integrated into the second alter in those three months because they weren't needed anymore and we as a while system took good care of each other after the abuse.

And of course, a stressful situation, a lot of dissociation and depersonalisation are also signs you may be getting a new alter, but I'd also look for if you have a feeling of being stuck in the situation. The reason an alter forms is when the person dealing with the trauma doesn't have the resources to deal with it. If you take good personal care of yourself during this stressful time, and if your system is stable enough that they'd help in the inner world by taking care of themselves and each other, then you'd most likely minimise the risk of getting a new alter. Allow yourself to express emotions even if in secret, talk about it on here or forums (psychforums has a really active DID forum), journal about it, talk to friends about it. If you have the chance, minimise the time you are exposed to this stressor. Use grounding techniques when you're dissociated and try to be in the moment and try to find alternative ways of changing the situation you're in, if possible.

Also know that getting a new alter isn't always a bad thing. The alter that in total took six months to form has literally changed the entire workings of our system and made us much healthier and helped everyone so much dealing with their trauma. Her work inside has been a real game changer for us. She has currently adopted one of our most traumatised littles, helped him immensely on top of everything else she has done, to the point a constantly crying little has grown up a few years and is actually a content, lovely kid.

A split is undesirable but sometimes the brain knows what it's doing and it can give you someone the system needs desperately."

AskDID,fpwqxlm,t1_fpvyeyb,1588968340.0,"I agree wholeheartedly, I just want to add one thing to this.

Based on the trauma, different alters do have different levels of existing. There are one dimensional Emotional Parts, for example an alter that only exists to encompass a feeling of extreme anger or extreme physical pain. While most Apparently Normal Parts will have a much more three-dimensional existence, they will be able to experience a wild array of emotions and thoughts and likes and dislikes. So one part, like a host, might feel like an ""original"" based on how multidimensional they are compared to a system of mostly emotional parts. That's mostly based on the complexity and the time of the trauma that caused that alter to take form."

Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fpvb1jg,t3_gfm99w,1588940474.0,"Sounds like a concussion but also there's a mental issue called ""dissociative fugue"", which is someone seemingly healthy with no prior problems with dissociation will ""lose time"" and find themselves somewhere. It sounds to me that you may have entered a fugue state and maybe had a concussion during this fugue. The stress of the whole process of this plus a possible head trauma would also explain the migraines later."

I'm much better now but I still have a lot problems understanding social cues, I can't speak up and ask questions during seminars because I feel like I'm about to get a panic attack as soon as I think about it, and if something is important to me I will prepare my sentences and possible responses beforehand in my head. I don't know how long it'd take me to be fully comfortable, however I am much better now after focusing on it for a few years (between ages 19-23 I focused on socialising a lot, watched people socialise and try to figure out their patterns)"
