The fabric is strong enough to use, no worries. You know how birds pick up animal fur and soft things to make their nests? I imagined that's how they get most of their material, as well as all the loose feathers they drop around. They use magic to enforce fabric and seams as they make it, because it's super easy for them. It allows the fabric to look very rippable while still holding body heat as well.

Not all gifts are taken when they move. Some may have been edible, some may have been living things like regular birds or a lovely flower they planted next to the hometree, or it could be a song. Sometimes gifts get recycled, like ""the person I got this beautiful, shiny coin from is no longer with us, but I bet they would've loved to know you so I give it to you now"". The thoughtfulness of a gift is the most important thing about it.

The perfect gift a child may give to their mentor would be a small version of what they would give to their parents, like a small cloth decoration, forget-me-nots or a handful of yummy beetles.

And yes, sometimes someone has so many things they can't carry their bag and have to do two trips. It's dangerous and not recommended. Giftgivers don't get offended by that, they would rather their friend is alive and healthy. Insecurity about the amount of gifts is more for children who want be popular among their friends, but the adults know that most of the more meaningful gifts are often nonmaterial. As for the space issue, they can make another bag and hang that on a treebranch if they have so many material things.

As mentioned, birdfolk are considered one of the wildfolks - secretive and fae, much attuned to the flow of raw magic and nature. They're originally from the northern parts of Cenur, where climate is very cold and can be compared to real-life Alaska.

Birdfolk are small and slender, only about 140cm in hight. They're light and breakable with hollow bones. Their facial features as humanoids are soft and dainty, eyes are round and black. As birds, they look very much like wrens.

Birdfolk communities are called flocks. The flocks are typically about 10-16 members strong, with at least three breeding couples. They build their homes to be easily dismantled if required, and are carefully hidden. They don't make weapons and would rather flee than fight, but when necessary, birdfolks use magic to distract or stop their attackers. Best plan is usually a very bright flash of light, switch to birdform, and a hasty escape.

Making their home hard to find and movable is not only a defensive stragedy, but it's also because birdfolk are migratory. They don't farm or even store much food. Most of their diet consists of seeds, plants and quite an impressive amount of insects. They can also feed on sources of magic when times are hard, but it leaves them light blue. ""Lean as a blue bird"" is a phrase often heard in the north.

Even though they are usually people-shy and timid, some flocks have gained the confidence to hold singing and dancing shows in exchange of coin. They also have one tradegood much valued by many; fabric. Traditional birdfolk clothing fabric is white, thin and airy, and much more expensive than the lower quality duty-fabric meant for everyday items.

Romance and love are highly appreciated in the society. They have numerous lovesongs, -stories and -poems dating from thousands of years back, spread through oral tradition. Elves, fellow romance appreciators, have taken to writing these down whenever they hear new ones. Birdfolk also give lots of gifts as a social thing. They put much thought into finding the best flowers, shiniest stones or smoothest furpatches to give both friends and family. There's a lot of symbolism they follow to not accidentally declare romantic love to someone other than their spouse, or let their child know they only see them as a friend.

When it comes to religion, birdfolk are pretty relaxed. They don't outright worship things like other wildfolks, but they do respect the mighty bear spirits.  Great Eagle and Great Mallard's marriage/union and their one hundred children are a thing they look up to, as well as Great Fox's tales, but even then it's more of an appreciation for the romance and not the religious aspect that draws them. An exception to most of the race is a small population living on Alga island where the community has picked Great Raven as a straight up religious figure. They would be considered fanatics by the rest of the birdfolk."

They hatch from eggs as birds do, go through a bird's childhood, and once they're strong and feathery enough, leave the nest. Most can't still reliably fly, so as a defense against predators, they learn to change shape instead. These babies are cared for by their parents and other community members until they're old enough to learn flight.

Once first flight is reached, they're considered children instead of babies. They also learn basic language instead of cheeping.

In puberty, birdfolk drop their mottled grey feathers that grow back off-white, either tinted with yellow or brown. Women have ever so slightly rounder hips than men, which can be seen easiest when comparing the two side-by-side. Otherwise they're very difficult to tell apart by outsiders. Their voices develop fully for elaborate songs and are the best way to identify individuals.

Adulthood lasts from age 10 to age 70. At old age birdfolk's feathers turn either ashy grey or pure white. Barring accidents and diseases, birdfolk would naturally live up to 90. Unfortunately they have a lot of predators that cut lives short."

Yes, they're racist. They don't like how meek and weak humans are compared to them, especially when humans are genetically so flexible they theoretically can have children with any other humanoid race.

I do have a race called elves as well. They're slender and fair, men can be described as pretty instead of handsome, their ears are classically pointed, and they live up to 400. They are vegans/vegetarians. Besides all that, they're very small and short, about 140cm at most.

Green gold and blue silver are jewellery metals enriched in magical energy, and they are far more resilient than their counterparts. If a metal vein is exposed to a vein of heartstone, it absorbs some of it's magical energy. You'll never know it's magical until you try to spell it or work it, when it starts turning a green or blue hue.

Moonsilver is a type of blue silver that's been purified to the point it no longer turns blue, but white instead. This is an arduous process of many days.

Dragon iron is the remnants of the dragon god's feathers and they retain their power of fire. There are quite a many of them around, and the larger ones have been made into legendary swords, daggers, arrowheads and even a shield, but there are a few big ones that have been broken into shards to use in other works as decoration.

To infuse magic into a work, you carve runes into the metal. If you want the spell to remain active all the time, you either add in an absorbing rune or fill the carvings with magic from your heartstone. Potentially you could use one of the magical jewellery metals. This method though means that the item will eventually need to be recharged.

My brother stayed the hell away from that mess. She focused particularily on me due to my drastically different values and less than desireable looks.

She was 14.

This caused me to lock myself into my room for about two years. I would go into the kitchen and hoard fruit to eat. That's all I ate and ended up losing half my hair for lack of nutrients. If she and her friends were home (often barricaded into the kitchen) I just went hungry to the point where I stopped caring if I ate or not.

At that point I had no idea what to do with my life, was graduating high school, had social anxiety, monthly breakdowns, and made a plan to off myself.

Then my mother decided I was being too much indoors. She started hounding me about getting a job and finishing my driver's lisence I didn't want in the first place, pressuring me about getting along with my toxic sister, and like a cherry on top of the shit-sundae, belittling me about everything whenever I had the courage to go sit in the livingroom. That driver's lisence fiasco was a shitshow of it's own that contributed about 45% of my overall stress.

Her clothing is carefully tailored and very high quality, her jewellery is tasteful and contains her favourite gemstones, and her hair is done in the time period's styles. I don't know what any of those look like, because I haven't decided what the present day looks like.

Keeping her status in mind, she must have had an education at some point. This means she is outwardly graceful and perfectly mannered, smart and perhaps wise when it comes to some matters.

She is also pretty young, only in her early twenties. She's not as knowledgeable about the world as she'd like to be, and has a lot to learn about ruling and politics. Everyone has their eyes on her. Perhaps she's still studying formally as well.

While she is graceful, well-educated, elegant, well-mannered and smart, she is also kind, diplomatic, and doesn't take shit lying down. She can't, and she won't. A noble disses her?

What I did at school was add salt to the dough and replace some of the sugar with farine sugar (brown sugar? But moist?). I had to tweak the sugar around a bit before I got to a consistancy I wanted.

You did nothing wrong and there's nothing wrong with you being yourself. She's overreacting to the slightest things you do. She's yelling at you for not going out and doing stuff? You're not her! And it really plucks a nerve with me because my mother sometimes nagged me about it as well.

Her yelling at you about being a third parent is either her projecting her insecurities or a power move.

If you had let the kid fall, you would've been blamed for it, I guarantee.

One thing that really stood out was you saying how you owe her. Unless you borrowed money from her, you owe her nothing. Children at the age of 10 don't owe anything to their parents, because parents are supposed to care and nurture you anyway. You don't even owe her your loyalty if you don't want to give it to her.

If you think it's still possible at this momemt, sit her down one evening after your siblings are in bed and ask her how she is. There's a possibility she's lashing out, but you won't know it if she refuses to even talk to you. If that's not going to work, it's best you put some distance between you. Her behaviour is not healthy to your mental state, so remove yourself from the situation if she's not going to change.
