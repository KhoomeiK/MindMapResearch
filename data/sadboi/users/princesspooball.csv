Tldt:Trump has a small stake through a mutual fund in Sanofi, a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine.

The president’s holdings in Sanofi are valued at up to $1,500, meaning he would not stand to profit much from the company’s stock performance.

Experts told us that Trump’s holdings do not violate federal conflict of interest laws.
