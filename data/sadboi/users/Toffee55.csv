ptsd,fr3mbjp,t1_fr0xozc,1589860593.0,"It does get better but it takes time. When I was first hit with it I could only get an hour of sleep a night, then two, three, etc. I take trazadol for sleep and started taking Zoloft (sertraline). I am up to 100 mg right now but think I need to have that increased. I was on duloxetine but it did nothing. 

Even though right now I am staying at my expartner's apartment and we are hunkering down in lockdown during this Covid thing and I have no idea what the future is going to bring I am still able to sleep at least 6 hrs or more, so even though the CPTSD intensity has increased due to the shock of the breakup (20 yr relationship) and basically my whole life being upended the CPTSD has not reverted back to how bad it was in 2018. 

So, yes, it does get better and I have been seeing a psychologist who specializes in trauma, PTSD, has worked with veterans, etc. I have much more work to do but I am hopeful I will continue to improve over time. Just be gentle with yourself."

His parents, well, hell. Probably one of the reasons he is the way he is is because of them and they obviously don't want to take ANY responsibility in doing the RIGHT thing here. All they want is to cover it up and make like it's YOU who is in the wrong. That's completely (\*@&#& up. And if THEY had found that video, they would have done NOTHING. 

I am just so, so, very sorry that this has all happened. I have PTSD and I know the hell that it is. That you dealt with this head-on and taking such heat for it, you are a fricken BOSS! You ROCK and you are my hero! I know you don't want to be a heroe, you just want the life that you had back but with a man that you thought you knew. 

I think, in time, down the road, this event will be better able to be viewed in retrospect, and, some of the heat of it will be dissipated. Time and therapy will help.

You've been exceptionally bang on with it all. You did it all in good time and you've protected your niece and child. You can feel GOOD about that! You are a true mother, a true protectress!

DeadBedrooms,fpbzp6u,t3_gckurd,1588483107.0,"Well, it sounds like she isn't putting in the effort? No, it's not normal to wane like that. I was HL in my relationship and it didn't wane for years and years. What ended up making a DB for me and my now ex was his family - they were a bunch of narcs and crushed him and we let resentments build between us, mostly him. He was heavily avoidant.

Aside from entering into counselling to get to the heart of things, I think she's not going to get it. Healthy good relationships are give and take, and lots of communication but also knowing yourself. You two are quite young. It may be an issue of maturity on her part as well. 

And OP, when I was her age I'd be doing it every day or every other day and I'm female so, yeah, you are not weird but quite normal. Get to counselling and if she refuses then what can you do but say I love you but if you're not willing to get to the bottom of things then I have to say good bye. You deserve to be loved well in all ways especially since you are offering that. Love needs to be reciprocal or you are just setting yourself up for heartache. Good luck!"

Somehow, some way you are going to make it. My relationship of 19 yrs ended and I am similar in that my career was linked with his and I don't know if we will continue or not so there is the financial insecurity and I've been out of the workforce for many years due to health issues. So, I hear ya, but somehow, someway, it's going to work out. It doesn't mean it won't be hell till you make it. I am very glad to hear you have support from family and friends. That is HUGE!!!

I have no family to fall back on but luckily, we are still friends, sort of like family and he is covering all my costs. I am actually staying with him during this COVID thing. For us, it was us both breaking down under stress caused by his family and life. 

Hang in there. You are going to make it. Things will become more clear as time goes on and good to hear you are seeing a counselor. You may also want to speak to a lawyer asap to figure out what your rights are and how to secure financials for child support, etc. Hang in there, be kind to yourself."
Divorce,fpbxvcz,t3_gcg34c,1588481619.0,There are a lot of things to consider. Did you ever have any counselling either for yourself or as a couple? Getting your own counselor may help you to figure out what you are feeling and how and what to talk to your now ex about. What are the reasons it ended and have those things been rectified? I am not for or against getting back together. A lot of people do and are happy and some do and then realize they shouldn't have.

So, yeah. I WAS getting better with the PTSD but when it all broke loose that our relationship of almost two decades was over well that just escalated everything. I am currently doing ACOA meetings (12-step meetings) which has been helpful and as per that program investigating the religion of my childhood to help me through this time, and it has helped.

He was psychologically ravaged by his toxic, narc family. They were the major reason we ended.

Divorce,fop4viw,t3_g8ma81,1587953131.0,"Take it slowly. I would also suggest reading some good books on the issue of infidelity as suggested in a previous response and to get yourself to a good counselor to discuss this BEFORE you go to couple's counselling. You can do online easily. Then, once talking this over with your counselor you can decide if you wish to reconcile and if so, under what conditions. And, a question to ask or think about is, okay, so she said the old boyfriend isn't who she thought he was. Well, who did she think he was, what qualities did she think he had? That may give you some insight as to what, perhaps, she may not be getting in your relationship? 

My 19 yr relationship ended in January this year and I have come to realize that we BOTH made mistakes, held resentments, lashed out, withheld. This really is an opportunity because it will probably go one of two ways; either you'll sort it all out and your relationship will be stronger than ever, or, you realize that it can't be saved, isn't what you need and it will end and enable you to take all that you have learned and have happiness with another in the future. Either way, you gain. Good luck and I am sorry for the pain this has caused you. It sucks, for sure."

ptsd,fop37st,t1_foltskw,1587952087.0,"Yvw. I'm right there with you. Reach out. I just finished a 12 step study group's first meeting that I almost didn't attend (online with ZOOM) because, again, that's a part of the disease, wanting to isolate, fear, etc. And towards the end I actually felt some peace. Imagine that. And then the voice again of ""you're alone, nobody loves you, be afraid, your ex doesn't love you."" and on and on and on. Then I stopped that last one, you're ex doesn't love you by saying back to it, ""Oh yeah, then why am I staying with him at HIS apartment during this whole COVID thing?"". He could have said NO and made me stay, alone back at my apartment, but he didn't, did he? And that voice had nothing to say back, in that moment. 
So, it's a moment by moment thing sometimes.
Just hang in there and never, ever give up. 
There is a program that is suppose to be good, it's Dynamic Neural Retraining System. I bought it and worked it a bit but right now just feel overwhelmed but I CAN see how it might work. My psychologist told me about it as two of her clients have done it and said it has helped them a lot. One thing though, if you are going through a new relationship break up (which I am, hilariously) that it might not be the time to do the program. I tell you this because it wasn't on their site when I decided to buy it but told me AFTER I bought it.
Much love to you, my friend. I wouldn't wish PTSD on anyone."

He left in early February and now I am at his apartment as we cohabitate together through the COVID thing. Your story gives me hope that somehow, we'll find our way back to each other. 

There are big changes that have happened that drove us, him, to this point. We did go to counselling and that was very helpful to figure out why he deadbedroomed me for a year and a half. There's a lot of healing he needs to do and I as well. The story isn't over yet. I have no idea where God is leading me in all this but I know the answer is to treat each other with compassion and kindness and for me to have courage. I think he just needs time to sort things out and I have to let him go to do that. It's been one of the hardest things of my life, and I am going through PTSD as well so that just makes it more challenging. But, I have faith that good will come from all of this.

DeadBedrooms,fnv1pl0,t3_g3wqo5,1587277394.0,"First off, man, I am just SO SO sorry. It absolutely and completely sucks. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. It's the most brutal thing to experience. 

Yeah, my ex, whom I am actually staying with, at his apartment, during this covid thing, had a head start on processing. He didn't leave me for another. In his case, it was huge resentments that he let fester and fester rather than confronting me with what I said that he felt hurt by. His attachment style is HUGELY avoidant and he fucking punished me with it. Yeah, I am still hurt, I mean, I vacillate because I know why he did and all that and in a lot of ways I don't hold it against him, but then again, yeah, that fucking hurt, a LOT. 

So, I feel ya. For me, he told me he no longer felt romantic love for me first week of December and moved out first week Feb. The kicker here is he still cares very much about me, does not want to have me out of his life. Long story. And, in a way, I feel the same way but you know, I'm not as devastated as I was just a few months ago. In the last few months I've been able to have those rose-coloured glasses slide down a bit and am seeing things I hadn't seen before and feeling that. He admitted that he hadn't been a very good partner for the last few years (he completely withdrew, for good reasons but still, it had a HUGE emotional, sexual, psychological and physical impact. HUGE. I was recovering from PTSD (that his uber toxic family caused) and when he broke the news that he wanted out, after all I sacrificed for him, well. And here I am now, in a city that I moved to for HIS career, etc. Not EVER, EVER doing THAT again. Lesson learned. 

So, yes, at first I was still very much still ""in love"" with him, but that's fading as I am seeing more and more that, hey, you really hurt me and you really did suck as a partner and I made all kinds of excuses for your behaviour. You'll see, as time goes on, your feelings will change. You've got to be on your side now. 

It's absolute shit what you are going through now. At least she didn't deny it. Now you know, as absolutely ungodly, hideously awful that is, now you know. 

And if I were you, I'd get a counselor and you can do this online.  I am still seeing my psychologist (now zooming) that I got almost a year and a half ago when I developed PTSD. Thank GOD I had her cause when this hit, I really needed someone who was up to speed on me. She got it right away and she basically diagnosed him. He's also got PTSD but isn't dealing with it. He's still doing what he's always done - avoiding what he needs to face (maybe I""m wrong) but this time it's not my job, never was, to fight his battels, to point out things, etc. That's where I went wrong. 

So get that psychologist/counselor to help you navigate this while you are in lockdown. How I do it as my psychologist will talk and I type in chat to her so that way he doesn't hear anything. It's a small one bedroom.

Unfortunately, you're not the only one going through this as so, so many are now and especially in this lockdown situation. It's shit, it feels like a new hell realm you never knew existed but I'm going to tell you this. Maybe, just maybe, this is the beginning of a better life for you? I know it sure as hell doesn't FEEL that way right now, but imagine how you felt when you were being born. It must have felt scary and wtf is going on, and coming out of that nice warm space and into the cold, and you were crying and all kinds of strange sounds and shapes and things looking at you (people) but you didn't know that?! Imagine how scared we must have been as new borns, totally helpless, not knowing where we were, who we were with, not knowing we even exist as us! Imagine!

So here you are, completely dazed as everything has completely changed! What was familiar and warm and comforting has now been stripped away and it's like being laid cold, barenaked in the middle of a blizzard. What the &#\^\^# just happened!?!?!

But, hang on. We are at the beginning of a new life. It feels like shit now but once we come out of our collective homes after this covid thing has cleared away a LOT of us will be walking into a completely new world and a completely different life. I don't know what mine will look like yet because there are a LOT Of things that need to happen between now and then. The only thing I can do, to keep my sanity, is to just take things one moment at a time, one day at a time. 

Hang in there, get help, lean on friends, use ZOOM or facetime or the phone to connect to friends and family for support, the ones that are there for you and will get it. I told two close friends what was going on for support.

Anything that is still standing be it a house or what have you, in order to have it continue it has to be maintained, the foundation needs to shored up, you name it. Nothing is forever but maybe, just maybe, something is for now and for awhile and that might just be enough."

Big hug and I hope at some point in the future you will be able to look back at this time and say ""Yeah, it hurt like hell and was one of the worst things I had been through but now my life is incredible and I hadn't of had it end, I would never have all the goodness that I have now"".

Divorce,fnn4vxi,t1_fnml7ju,1587084465.0,"Wow, this is so poetically, beautifully, tenderly written. I can feel what you describe. Right now, with my PTSD and living with my ex (we are friends now) till this COVID thing is over and then I just don't know what's next. But maybe, just maybe, there is a plan unfolding that I'm not aware of and part of that plan is a beautiful future filled with love of community, new friends and perhaps that special one to share the rest of my life with. I sure hope so. We'll see what and who and all as things unfold. It's sure hard though, at times, infact, terrifying. But then there are moments of it's going to be okay. He left in early February so these are early days."

Thanks for that."

The facts are even confusing or conflicting, hard to reconcile. So, I'll just take things one thing, one day at a time. That's really all I can do."

I wish I could get back together with my now ex, as I sit on his couch here while he works on a project as we hunker down together to get through this COVID thing. I wish you the absolute best and much happiness."
deadbedroom,fniieea,t1_fngx1xx,1586980526.0,"It's a tricky thing, isn't it. I wish us both, I pray that somehow things become clear and the direction to move in is made more evident. I pray for us both and our SO. Even though he has left me, he needed to be single and on his own, somehow I still love him like a SO. I am working at leaving him with God and asking God to help me in the ways that I need to go, to heal, etc. This is definitely one of the hardest things I have ever gone through."
deadbedroom,fnii288,t1_fngzm2y,1586980360.0,Well that's a whole different story then. There's a lot to work through there and I do know how much work a special needs child is. It can be completely overwhelming!
Divorce,fngjont,t1_fne9bea,1586934392.0,Thanks for your honesty. And you're right. That was my first marriage. It's just the way he was hard-wired and he lied like a log.
Divorce,fngjji1,t3_g181b8,1586934260.0,"THEIR the ones who should be ashamed, not you! They both lied to you! And yeah, just watch, that old saying, ""If they'll do it with you they'll do it TO you"", is TRUE! I've seen happen over and over again. 

It sucks but at least you didn't spend one more of day of your precious life wasted on this sack of crap. It hurts, it's not your fault. You went all in with your heart and love. You have NOTHING to be ashamed of! May you meet your TRUE love who will treat your heart like it's made of the most precious and fragile material on earth. May you finally know true and loyal love. May we both know it."
deadbedroom,fngiqv4,t3_g1cohk,1586933527.0,"She went to counselling twice and said that's it. I have been in counselling on and off over the years to deal with big matters. It takes WORK and EFFORT to sort out your shit so that you can be a better you for yourself and thereby for others. 

There's obviously some deep stuff happening there. My money is on built up resentments she's not sharing with you. Sounds like she might be an avoidant attachment style? Either way, how can you not want to sit close to someone you love and to cuddle and make love. I don't get it. I still don't get it. My marriage ended and it was because of long held resentment (by my now ex that I am sitting beside because we are housing together during this COVID thing), that he had when he didn't communicate to me that what I said had hurt him. He buried that deep and it festered and festered. He also DB'd me for over a year and a half and basically, honestly, disappeared into video games and the screen because that was his way to cope with a toxic and unbearable family situation that was a never-ending shit show. His family ruined our marriage. He is also heavily avoidant so even though I tried to start conversations to deal with the DB and stuff, I got nowhere. He'd just shut down.

It wasn't until we entered into couple's counselling where everything came out, what I did tha the felt hurt by and then what he did that I felt hurt by. And that was that. He ended it. So I did finally find out wtf happened but the damage was done (by his family and by him not doing proper relationship maintenance. You can't fix or apologize for something if the person doesn't TELL you. 

So now, here I sit, with him. Still love him but also deeply hurt, still by him. And honestly, I don't how long it's going to take to heal from all of this. 

My ex took responsibility for what he did and didn't do. That he admitted he put his family, hell, even the cat first before our relationship. And he was deeply, deeply sorry, cried buckets. A lot of remorse when it all became evident. Your wife needs to fess up!

If she's not willing to take responsibility for her shitty attitude towards you, then that's it. And by the way, the kids don't come first, first self-care, then you, the relationship then the kids because THIS Is what happens when the kids come first. A broken marriage. You just can't ignore your spouse and expect everything to be great. People need love and care. They need to know they are appreciated, cared for loved. 

You sound like a lovely human being. There is someone out there just waiting to shower love, attention and affection on you. Go find her."

CPTSD,fncxlac,t3_g0vwou,1586850756.0,"Yep, I do that too. It's a part of thinking we have control and in a lot of ways we don't. And yes, it's part of the amygdala hijack, those thoughts. I have them too. And yes, it's exhausting and I have to work at distracting myself or changing the station so to speak by thinking of something happy or imagining something happy/pleasant/good."
Divorce,fncx6t1,t3_g0y49c,1586850337.0,"Well, as tough as that was all to hear, this could be the beginning of some real true communications with your daughter. She's becoming an adult and her telling you that was, well, pretty adult and you can feel good that your parenting allowed her to develop in a way that she can confront and communicate. This could be the beginning of a better relationship with her, and, with yourself. Think about things, get a counselor if you don't have one and go through it. You'll be stronger and better for it."

DeadBedrooms,fncwh08,t1_fn8tm5q,1586849605.0,"The self-confidence thing will change with time. I have noticed mine has and it was pretty freakin' shaky back in December when all this bust loose. The ending of this relationship really, now that I take a good look at it, was about 90% because of his highly dysfunctional toxic family and how he dealt with that (poorly). It had very little to do with me. As he said during one of our many talks as our relationship was unwinding. He said he wasn't a very good partner, and you know, in some ways, that's true, he really sucked. When you start to get some distance your viewpoint about yourself will change and the confidence will come back."

Divorce,fncvrrb,t1_fn9ttau,1586848884.0,"It's a really good time to expand your social circle. That's one thing I realized is that I had no social circle here in the city I moved to for HIM, and that left me at a real deficit. Lesson learned! So, I am now slowly getting to know people and make new friends. It's going to take time, especially with the COVID. I am also leaning on my established good old friends I have to help me through this."
Divorce,fncvlhl,t3_g0hlmq,1586848710.0,"I so hear you. My 19 yr relationship ended with him leaving beginning of February 2020 and in March I am at his apartment during this COVID thing. I had the panic attacks (have ptsd) during the unwinding of our relationship and still dealing with it. We went to couples counseling and there I found out about attachment theory. I am currently of the anxious type and my now ex is heavily avoidant. Also, the ending of the relationship stirred up latent abandonment issues that my psychologist brought to my attention. Yep, I can relate to all you are saying. We want to stop the ""fall"" the loss. It literally feels or felt like I was going to die wihout him. I know that has a lot to do with the PTSD as well. 

Maybe you and he can continue as a friendship? Not expect any sexual or romantic stuff but as dear friends to keep each other company through this and support each other as you both continue to look for ""the one""? That might work :) It's a time where we can use all the friends we can get."
DeadBedrooms,fn91380,t1_fn8tm5q,1586755998.0,"Nope. I had that part, self-confidence issue, but I am realizing it really has nothing to do with me. It was HIS problem, not mine."

DeadBedrooms,fn8rqsv,t1_fn7bzqp,1586748546.0,"Honestly, I feel ya. I have no idea what lies before me but I have to just have faith in God (that's my path) and that the pain I am going through now (ending of our romantic relationship but continuation of friendship) will somehow all make sense in retrospect. I just keep putting one sometimes very shaky foot in front of the other. Just imagine when this whole COVID thing is over. Life will truly be a new experience. I want to make my life over with it."

DeadBedrooms,fn8rdq4,t3_fzwknf,1586748277.0," I totally understand. It's a very painful thing it does cause sexual problems in oneself where there weren't any before. I know. In some ways, I am actually sexually aversive now because of our DB. My ex was withholding. It was because of his own stuff and a little mine, ours. But he's super avoidant and he let resentments build. And now, I am housed up at his apartment (he left) because of Covid. Life is weird. So yes, I don't know what will happen but I just am kind of shut down sexually myself now and I use to have a sexually healthy life. Oh well, much damage has been done but maybe one day it will all be well again. My heart goes out to you."

I had a tough day today but have managed to have some peace in the later evening. I think lower cortisol in the evening helps as well. Thanks again SO MUCH and I hope you are doing well where you are :)"
ptsd,fn43yhx,t3_fzbitw,1586633573.0,"WOW! I really needed to hear some positivity and hope around ptsd as I struggle with another morning of dread, fear and suicide ideation. My marriage of 19 years ended just two months ago and long story short, kind of had a melt down - ex came with me to hospital and agreed to have me stay at his place till my meds loaded. I was just not able to cope, barely moving. Then two days later Covid hit and I am still here , a month later. He still loves me and actually is supportive, now. He also has c-ptsd but doesn't realize it. Super toxic family system that killed our marriage and nearly he and I. Both in counselling separately. 

It's like you say, my brain is locked into the past. It believes the past is all that will be. The trauma loop my limbic system is in is convinced that no good will come of anything, I had two long term relationships that I thought God wanted me to have and then both gone. The first one was abusive, that I finally woke up to but the second one was with a really good person who was just so absolutely damaged as a child by a psychopathic mother and narcissistic and enabling father. They used their other son, a disabled son, as the hook to keep my ex always in their hooks and the series of dramas, stresses, litigations, you name it. They crushed him. He is heavily avoidant attachment and I am anxious attachement and we both went down into that sick family system.

And now, I have cptsd and so does he and honestly, sorry for teh long windingness of this reply, but my limbic brain just keeps saying it's better to die as because of the past \*you gave your life over to God and look how THAT turned out\*. I feel like I am in an epic battle for my life here. I'm 57 and currently living with my ex as we stay at home and ride out this covid thing. To what end? Who knows. Yes, I must find hope wherever I can because, I KNOW that there is the possibility that life could be good again and maybe, just maybe I'll be third time lucky in love at some point in the future. So much healing to do. Thank you for your post here, as it gives me some hope!"
