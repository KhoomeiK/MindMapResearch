His friend understands it because he is in pain too. They don't see any option to end the pain, so they attempt suicide. 

Both fail. But after the failed attempt, the first man realizes that his foot is all healed and there's no pain anymore, so he tells his friend that ""things were never that bad to begin with"", he should've been patient and he's grateful to be alive and ""suicide bad"".

abusiverelationships,evlnrqg,t3_ck66ot,1564596942.0,"Not an empowering story!!

I was with my boyfriend for 4 years. Things started good, went on to be amazing, nearly perfect. Somewhere, somehow things changed after the first year. We 'fell in love'. He started becoming possessive and so controlling. I completely changed myself to what he wanted me to be.

I wore what he approved, ate what he approved, my schedule revolved around his, I gave up all my friends and could talk to only a handful of people that he approved. I gave up on social media because he didn't like it. I was specially close to two of my cousins, both male, he became insecure about that (Like, I like my cousins but still, ew) so I stopped talking to them.

Worst part is, he never forced me to, I did it to please him, but I did it of my own will. Things were going well enough for me. Anyhow, last year, April 22nd 2018, I found out he got married two weeks before that (April 8th). That was a... shock, to say the least.

I confronted him, he nearly hit me, we were in a public place and I had a huge breakdown so the cops got involved and everything. 

He says he was forced into the marriage by his family, I believed him. He had already talked to lawyers about divorce, I believed him. He didn't want to tell me because he didn't want to worry me, I believed him. We could run away the next day, I agreed. I planned everything, cleared my savings account, packed my bags, and waited for him. And waited. And waited.

He never showed up, switched off his phone, house empty. That's some ghosting. And that, internet strangers, is how my abuser left me.

I went into crippling depression filled with self harm, suicidal thoughts, attempts, the package you know. And that was how I went about it. I don't remember more than half of last year. I've only just started to open up about things and regain the confidence and self esteem I had lost. In fact, up until a few months ago I didn't even realise that it was an abusive relationship. Strange, what conditioning can do.

Would anything have prepared me for it? I don't think so. If I had recognised the signs earlier, if I had not pushed away my friends, hundreds of ifs."
