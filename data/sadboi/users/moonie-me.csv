So the moment I learned about the first confirmed case in India, I was like... ""they are fucked..."". Life in India is hard. These people are poor (apart from the ultra-rich 1%). Some are crammed with their large families is small flats, some don't even have a home (e.g. the lowest caste people, rickshaw drivers, they sleep on their rickshaws). They can't just lock up at home and wait it out, order groceries and have them delivered. They can't even drink tap water! The overwhelming majority of the population lives hand to mouth. Quite literally. I can't imagine how India will cope.

That said, the term ""health issues"" is very broad and ambiguous. Drinking sugary drinks as well as sugar-free drinks may lead to teeth deterioration, that's a health issue. When it comes to the ingredients found in diet soda, each of them may affect the body differently, if consumed in excess.

**Aspartame** has a bad rap but is by and large harmless. ""*Experiments have shown that the doses of aspartame required to pose danger to humans are far larger than what any normal person could consume in a day. The FDA has set the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for aspartame at 50 mg/kg of bodyweight - the equivalent of a whopping 18 to 19 cans of diet soda*."" So it's perfectly safe.

**Acesulfame-K** \- ""toxic if consumed in very large doses - but the amounts of acetoacetamide found in spoonfuls of Ace-k are far below dangerous levels.""

**Sucralose** \- ""*The acceptable daily intake for sucralose is 5 mg/kg bodyweight per day, but the typical person‚Äôs estimated daily intake is a significantly lower 1.6 mg/kg per day. Human trials haven‚Äôt reported any significant dangerous effects for sucralose at all - but similarly to studies on aspartame, some research has found a relationship between sucralose intake and migraine headaches.""* You might want to check how many mg you're consuming per day and limit it to below 5 mg/kg.

**Saccharin** \- by far the most controversial out of the four. Studies on animals have found close linkages between saccharin intake and the development of cancer (in rodents) and impairing glucose metabolism (also in rodents). Some studies in humans suggest that saccharine may lower glucose tolerance. However, these studies are inconclusive and for now, there‚Äôs no compelling evidence to suggest that normal doses of saccharin pose any harm to humans. You may want to limit it.

Most diet drinks also contain significant amounts of caffeine. Look up your recommended daily intake and try not to exceed it. Flush your mouth with water after drinking a soda and brush your teeth often. 2 sodas per day is not too much, you don't need to worry. :)

Here are some articles and studies, if you'd like to research the subject more closely:

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27934644](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27934644) \- CONCLUSION: Regular SSB intake, but not diet soda intake, is associated with a greater increase in insulin resistance and a higher risk of developing prediabetes in a group of middle-aged adults.

[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27797893](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27797893) \- CONCLUSION: Diet soda consumption was associated with higher ESRD risk in this general population sample. **Further research is necessary** to validate these findings in other study populations and to examine potential mechanisms through which diet soda could impact kidney disease.
