Other than that I've been practicing hard swapping between chords. Also started Pentatonic scale position 1, but im still slow for it so I need to practice that hard too.

It's pretty easy for PS1,2 since people already made the emulation ultra good (with couple of games exceptions of course) so Sony can just make one team and just make it better. Even with the PS3 emulation, it starts to get good with some titles, and even with the exclusives. I believe 200% that if Sony puts some really good engineering/programming team they can figure it out pretty easy, also it has pretty good specs (the PS5) so it would be able to handle it. For CD's it already has a chip on the optic drive (on the PS4) but it wasnt activated so it needs re-programming on that part to enable it. Yes it's not easy, but it's pretty achievable."
