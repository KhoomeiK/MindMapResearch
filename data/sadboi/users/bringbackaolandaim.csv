socialanxiety,fgkhrkm,t1_fgkcx9s,1580865859.0,does that help?

DadForAMinute,fdcz1xk,t1_fdcd7gt,1578288601.0,"I don’t know if this would change your mind but it’s because the guy who did it was a relative who was 4 years older. It went on for three years but because I was 4 and the guy was 8 and learned from being abused himself, my abuse isn’t as important. However he was really awful the way he abused me for those three years, my dad doesn’t seem to believe me. Lawyers and psychologists have told me that it was a big enough age gap that he could be help legally responsible and we were in different stages of development, giving him power. I’m sorry I’m saying so much I guess if my dad can’t see the awful he did I want a dad who can, even an internet one haha."

ptsd,ereylou,t1_erexn5i,1560795878.0,"After digging I found out the daughter doesn’t live with him thankfully. She seems him once a week, but he hates the mother of his child because she doesn’t want him with the kids alone, which shows me that at least someone is looking out for the little one. As far as navigating situations like my coworker, I have no idea. I feel like since being diagnosed I’ve found mostly a nice balance, but sometimes the wrong person finds out and it’s the WORST."
socialanxiety,erey5rk,t1_erc98ia,1560795586.0,Im so proud of you! And so happy for you. I hope things stay on the up!:)
socialanxiety,erey2d1,t1_erbxibt,1560795522.0,"Omg same! I had a set of acceptable T-shirt’s to wear out that were not too basic but not too ‘in-your-face’ whatever that means lmao. Now I wear merch of bands, podcast, etc., And only get a LITTLE anxious about it. Everything’s a process!"
socialanxiety,erexq8i,t1_erbvvs0,1560795300.0,Thank you! It’s so nice for another tall girl to relate. Most people think I’m insane when I say I feel like I stand out or feel less feminine somehow. This comment really made me happy:)
socialanxiety,erexl4i,t1_erbrjrf,1560795202.0,"It’s really nice! Still afraid to wear fake lashes, but the fact that’s my biggest issue is big for me haha. Honestly though self growth happens throughout your whole life and i got lucky to get over it at 20s. My mom said she didn’t really grow into herself until her 40’s, and she’s still doing it. Overall self growth is a everlasting progress, and I’m proud of both of us for being as far as we are now!:)"
socialanxiety,erexagx,t1_erbrb50,1560795007.0,"I’m 20 too, and about 5’11 now as well. Honestly I’m proud of you for trying to branch out even if you haven’t yet. It took me a process of over 4 years of small changes until I got to where I wanted. It’s a huge process but like as clique is it is, if I can do it really anyone can."

ptsd,ereww8k,t1_erer7qs,1560794743.0,"This!! God I remember someone at work asked why the bosses were so cool with my missing shifts, which I said, “I have PTSD,” to shut him up after his rant about how he wishes he could too. He just says, “war or rape?” Just like that. Like, legitimately asking me if I went to war or was raped to get PTSD. When I denied to answer, he said, “my 9 year old as PTSD from rape, but I don’t think it’s as bad as she puts on.” Made me realize a lot of people who disregard are so completely ridiculous to anyone else listening. Most of all though, made me want to save his poor daughter."
ptsd,eqru2ro,t1_eqrtq08,1560269895.0,I know it’s really hard. Just try to remember you aren’t alone with it. I’m glad you get to see your therapist.
ptsd,eqrt8bp,t1_eqrb89v,1560269320.0,This is really good advice. Everyone I’ve talked to (including myself) who has done EMDR has had amazing improvement. It really helped me the first six months of my diagnosis especially.
ptsd,eqrt3e3,t3_bzdowh,1560269223.0,"I used to wet the bed whenever I have nightmares regarding my own abuse. My therapist said this is really normal, and regarding sexual assault, a lot of people who have been abused as kids/ teens wet the bed, it’s really common, just not something talked about. I suggest when you’re stressed to sleep on a towel, set alarms to wake up and use the restroom, and wear panty liners. It’s hard to predict sometimes, but better safe than sorry. But mainly I just wanna say don’t be ashamed of it; because it’s normal."
ptsd,eqrsneh,t1_eqr54vd,1560268909.0,"Idk if this is the most appropriate thing for this sub. A lot of people have PTSD for childhood trauma and to be really honest with you, DDLG is disgusting. Not something to compare people who have trauma to."
ptsd,eqrsj82,t1_eqrj91s,1560268826.0,"I’m the same! I used to go to parks every week after being first diagnosed with PTSD, and just listen to music and go on the swings. I always felt weird and creepy about it even though I just wanted to live some childhood fun I didn’t get. Really nice knowing others get it"
ptsd,eqrrx0a,t3_bz7gxg,1560268412.0,"My therapist said this is normal. I really enjoy doing things that are kinda childish and make childish jokes because I missed out when I was younger, and it’s a very normal thing. I thought I was alone with this, but she said that she had many patiences who did the same thing."
ptsd,eqhxwy0,t3_byhoo6,1560073522.0,"I feel this so hard. When I was first diagnosed with PTSD, I’d have panic attack a few times a week where I’d just yell how I had to go. Go where? No clue. But I needed to get to wherever it was I was going, and would sob because I had no where. I’m a lot better now, but sometimes I’m still like “I have to get to the next point” having no idea what it actually is."
narcissisticparents,eqdu5q8,t1_eq9ivau,1559995082.0,"No it’s fine it’s long! Looks like you had a lot to get off your chest, and you’re welcome to message me and rant whenever you like. I found moving out really helped. I moved countries about a year and a half ago (it led to months of arguments lol) but it was ultimately what I wanted to do and the best decision I’ve made so far. Following my dreams and being myself despite my past has made me grow, and become the person I want to be. I think getting away from nparents is such a life changer and as great as I imagined as a kid lol"
narcissisticparents,eqdtrem,t1_eq92yg1,1559994917.0,"Yeah I get this! I’m 20 and I’ve learned to ignore it, however I get very pissed off when he does this in front of my 6 year old sister. She’s too young to know not to listen to him, and she’s already developed anxiety due to having nparents. I just wish I could do more to protect her."
narcissisticparents,eqdtkez,t1_eq6sic3,1559994837.0,"No it makes sense. I’ve been ripped apart for crying too, for dumb stuff. You were justified in being upset and your ndad was just being an ndad. I hope things got better for you!"
narcissisticparents,eqdtaq8,t1_eq6l54a,1559994732.0,"Same. Honestly this thread has helped so much. My former therapist brought up that he could be a narcissist, along with my mom (his ex wife) saying the same, but there’s something comforting finding a community of people who relate. At the end of the day when he says he’ll die, if my little sister isn’t there, I say “I mean I will too,” but it just seems to annoy him. Would be lying if I said his annoyance wasn’t a little satisfying lol"
narcissisticparents,eqdsx3n,t3_by34fs,1559994578.0,"I don’t remember I time my nparents DIDN’T say this. I think it’s super common. I find it helps talking to close friends or even a therapists to reassure Im not being dramatic, even when deep down I know I’m not, because hearing it from your parents is gonna sting no matter what."
narcissisticparents,eq5w26y,t1_eq5tj7e,1559815772.0,"I’m glad someone else can relate tbh. Grew up thinking this was normal and the other day friends gave me weird looks saying their parents NEVER did that. Only realized recently how much of a narcissist he is, especially since he’s been doing this as long as I can remember. He is fairly healthy besides high blood pressure, so there’s not really a reason he’d die. He always brings up car accidents etc."
ptsd,epykuhc,t3_bwk8ud,1559640791.0,Thank you. Really needed this today. People like you are such gifts to the world. Thank you
narcissisticparents,epw1qbb,t1_epw066w,1559562522.0,"Also, I have reported him to the police, but in that state nothing he did under 18 counts, even though my other cousin, also his cousin, was abused by him when he was 12. It’s quite fucked."
narcissisticparents,epw1my2,t1_epw066w,1559562414.0,"The issue is he was only 4 years older. I was 4, he was 8. So they say he’s not a peadophile, but “it was natural to be attracted to someone his age.” If you look in my post history I explain it n r/ptsd. It’s a fucked situation"
ptsd,epfyvbp,t1_epd27re,1559204140.0,"I moved to a different country, and I honestly am not sure how the health care system here works, which is the issue getting therapy. I’ll look more into it. Thank you for the advice :)"
ptsd,ep51vb9,t1_eouwcws,1559049315.0,"I’ve read this comment a lot. It really really feels nice to have the support. Having someone, especially an internet stranger, seem to care so much is almost overwhelming tbh. I’m really really thankful."
ptsd,ep51q0e,t1_eow0qev,1559049256.0,Thank you. This really really warmed my heart. Saw it yesterday and came back today to cheer myself up a little:)
ptsd,ep51lpa,t1_eowhj9o,1559049204.0,"Thank you. I did EMDR for about 6 months, and it really helped, however i moved states and couldn’t go to that therapist anymore. I’ve found it extremely hard to be open with anyone besides her, and haven’t gone to regular therapy since, due to a lack of trust. I know this is kinda off topic, but if you have any advice for growing the balls for therapy, that would also help haha."
ptsd,eoyw49q,t1_eowr30c,1558947695.0,"I’m glad you got to get that off your chest, and honestly it makes me feel better knowing someone else has gone through this. Most people weren’t abused by another child, and if they were I’ve found most families to be more excepting than ours. I hope life gets better for you. You’re also welcome to PM me whenever. It’s such an awful situation and having someone there who understands is really nice."
ptsd,eove09l,t1_eoupan4,1558893510.0,Thank you. Really means a lot to have support.
