istp,fpsekki,t1_fprh82m,1588872149.0,"I think I understand you.  To you, spending weekends together is enough, to some that is unacceptable.  People are different.  Currently I'm with an ISTJ and small talk is nonexistent. Weekends are enough. But in previous relationships (always ENFPs) I felt obligated to send ""yeah"" and ""ok"" and include them in everything.  After 13 years of dating I've learned to establish early that I will not respond to statements if I have nothing to say about them.  If she wants a response, ask a question.  If she's merely providing me data, I do eagerly read her messages even if I don't respond.  I am quite the talker for an ISTP so if I have an opinion, rest assured I will share it.

This goes both ways, when she feels down or unappreciated she feels free to say so and I can easily provide my opinion with supporting arguments on what an incredible human being she is.  She understands my lack of need for validation leads me to neglect providing it for others.

Tl;dr Ask him to pose a question if he's seeking feedback.  Explain how you feel about your space.  Share this post, even.  


EDIT: All these female ISTP comments are shocking. I've only met one other ISTP ever,  a 55 year old female coworker.  Our type seem to be good at hiding."
