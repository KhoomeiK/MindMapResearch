Work on your happieness and self acceptance. You are the seed of generations of suffering and effort. It‘s decades and 100rets of years in you. And you are here. Be proud of that. Something that survived all of this can never be ugly. Live that way. Be proud of yourself and your family. And you will see how the world is changing. Lots of love.

Well, if you fully trust your doctor, that‘s your decision. I personally had only bad experiences with Doctors of the modern world and big pharma. I believe it‘s all a big lie. And the key to happieness and health is hidden from us. I was where you‘ve been. I‘ve almost killed myself. Out if desperation. Because my body and my mind were useless. No doctor could help me. So I went to another country and tried the real medicine. It showed me the way. And now I am happy to give this knowledge to anyone who wants to heal too. Maybe we can talk in private.

Why not giving this experience your full attention? When he came back, I told him: thank you, but nevermind. 

For me it was about worries. The worries to forget what I am experiencing right now. And the more we worry, the more it‘s gonna happen. So I decided to trust, that this experience is gonna last forever. And till now, it is. I wrote a few things down after the whole ceremony. But just some side notes for me. I think I would‘t need them though. And I think it was a good decision not to write down while inside. You wouldn‘t stop and take a picture yourself, or write something down, on your wedding day, would you? In the best moment, when you say „I do“, would you interrupt to write down how you feel? Or is it better to enjoy the moment. I think feeling is more important here. And real feelings you remember forever. That‘s my opinion. And I am happy with my decision. 😊❤️🙏🏼"
