Psychic,fl7z188,t1_fl7su2p,1584912417.0,"your oracle card is number 36, Blend into the environment, which features an octopus. Like an octopus you posses great intelligence and problem solving skills. You have the ability to hide from the spotlight, and might not get as much credit as you deserve. People may underestimate you. However, you have a great mental agility, and know how to get things done. You have the queen of spades, which reinforces that intelligence and wit. However, you are also very empathetic, honest and have strong moral beliefs. You have the 9 of clubs, which suggests you have endurance, or that you may even be a bit stubborn. You are persistent and don't give up easily. This translates to integrity, and again, working with the queen of spades, you have a backbone. Finally, you have the 7 of hearts. You are a bit of a daydreamer, and may need to be more realistic. Your intelligence and mental agility gives you a strong imagination, which sometimes may need to be reeled in. However, you can also use that imagination to problem solve in unique ways."

CPTSDmemes,fkxotk4,t1_fkxkdn9,1584632526.0,"nah I know someone with NPD who is hurt very much by these types of messages and feels like they can't be involved in cptsd communities despite having cptsd.

NPD is classified not only on behaviors, but also on internal symptoms such as mood disregulation, and needing outside validation often. There's no reason in particular why a narcissist can't improve their behavior or have healthy relationships if they acknowledge their problems and work on them. Theyre still going to have NPD, but they arent going to be an abuser. 

and while I get your point about trying to not take it personally and realize someone just had a bad experience, its different when you get that message over and over again from the same communities. they cant visit a lot of forums like this bc then they start panicking and thinking theyre a really bad person and they just dont know it, etc, etc

but bc they cant visit these kinds of forums, theyre now limited on support and help they could recieve considering they have cptsd. they feel super alienated. 

so like, maybe try to seperate narcisism from emotional abuse

yes a narcissist can be more prone to emotional abuse 

but theres no such thing as narcissistic abuse. its just emotional abuse by a narcissistic person. and not all emotional abusers are narcissists."

then, since you know about pete walker, Im assuming youve got access to his books or perhaps his articles online? He details how to get out of an emotional flashback. I more or less do his suggested steps, plus some other techniques

and many people have food allergies or food intolerances that would make a low carb diet burdonous. each person needs to decide for themselves what balance of foods truly make them feel good and give them energy. its not the same for everyone

if you like your diet, then thats excellent, but I wouldnt recommend it to everyone. I know this is mostly testimonial, but I did a low carb diet and it made me very sick and tired the entire time. even when I stopped it took at least a week to build myself back up. but of course it did this! I was literally telling my body that it couldnt have what gave it energy. And I was eating a lot of dairy when I am lactose intolerant. I also cannot have alternatives like almond milk becuase I am allergic to almonds. I ate food with almond flour because it followed the diet. I had heart palpitations. my income and intolerances simply didnt work for the diet and the diet didnt work for me. I am much healthier eating many different foods with a variety of macroingredients. 

my parents were awful fad dieters though, and at this point I really cant see any diet other than ""strive for nutrients and variety"" as good."

Im thinking it may be an intersex fish. It also chases the one adult female in a similar way Ive seen mamy male guppies do. Also the ""gravid spot"" it has is pink and unfertilized. It also may just be a decorative pink spot on the guppies body that mimic it. 

Its three times larger than the only adult male I have. The phoro doesnt show, bc I chose one that best displayed the anal fin, but it has a blue and violet irridescence to the body and it brightens up every day (Ive currenrly only had the fish 5 days, they are a group of rescued guppies, most juveniles, with 1 adult male, 1 adult female, and this mystery fish) I had theorized it was possibly finrot until it started chasing the adult female."

CPTSD,f5oimk1,t3_dojs77,1572319180.0,"This can go a few ways, depending on what kind of upset I am. 

When I was young I was made out to be too needy when I was being mostly normal. I would get in trouble for complaining and figured out early on that trying to express my feelings and upsets just got me lectured.

So, I now find it very hard to seek connection when I am upset

A) bc I do not want to be percieved as needy or a burden 

And B) Im just used to dealing with things on my own this point, and trying to involve someoneelse can be stressful.

Often too I'd been lured into expressing myself, just to get in trouble. So I may not necessarily trust someone just bc they say they want to help. 

It can also involve a fear of abandonment. Allowing someone to be close when you are hurting is intimate, and it means that that person can now hurt us.

I suggest talking to them about it once they are feeling better. They may still not come forward with everything, but its important for you guys to understand eachother."
