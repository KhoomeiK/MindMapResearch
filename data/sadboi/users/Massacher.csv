nvidia,fqzobxq,t1_fqxv0o4,1589771656.0,"I figured out how to get it working shortly after I posted this. Since I'm using Voicemod as well it can interfere with RTX voice. I have to launch it first which it does automatically on startup and then launch Voicemod. So essentially my mic is used three times. Once by RTX Voice, once by Voicemod and once by Windows. 

Yes I have RTX Voice set in Streamlabs OBS. It wasn't sticking at first because of the conflict with Voicemod."
nvidia,fqwzeta,t3_gl9p90,1589722011.0,"**Status:** UNRESOLVED

**Computer:** Custom built by me

**GPU:** GALAX GeForce RTX 2080 OC 8GB

**CPU:** Ryzen 7 3700X 3.60 - 4.40 GHz

**Motherboard:** Asus ROG Strix X570-E Gaming

**RAM:** LPX 16GB (2 x 8GB) DDR4 DRAM 3200MHz C16 Memory Kit - Black

**PSU:** Corsair RM 750x 750Watt

**Operating System and Version:** Windows 10 Pro version 1909 build 18363.752

**GPU Drivers:** 445.87

**Description of Problem:** I am using nVidia RTX Voice and I know it is supposed to block out background noise but it's doing the opposite. It's picking it up.

I use Streamlabs OBS as my streaming software. I also have Voicemod which has a soundboard. I was experimenting with the different voices but they are all too difficult to understand so I abandoned that. I am using the v2 beta which has the soundboard. I have the Pro license so fully functional. Anyway to my point.

I am testing my stream by recording. I have my speakers and microphone in the mixer. My microphone is using the NVIDIA RTX Voice plugin/app but it's not blocking out the sound of the game I'm playing. It's even picking up the sound of my PC fans! Up until now I had a noise gate and some other filters to block out background noise. I thought I'd give this new app/plugin a try to see if it does a better job. Why isn't this software doing the job it's designed to do?

**Troubleshooting:** I have tried using the Noise Suppression filter on my microphone and set it to the maximum available, -60. Still it picks up my game audio and any other sounds nearby."

Open up Chrome and you will see that the webpage is still there but it has to refresh. I suspect this is probably what's happening with your streams not being saved. 

If you want to access settings you have to do it on your PC. Or open on Twitch in a web browser on your phone and access from there."
Twitch,fqqixgx,t1_fqqij13,1589566318.0,Yes I have. But it lacks some features. I stream from my PC where I have more control. The Twitch mobile app is mainly just to view streams. To store past broadcasts you have to access your settings on your PC. The mobile app doesn't have that.
Twitch,fqqgmvt,t3_gkcvk1,1589565182.0,"VODs are saved if you have the setting turned on in Twitch settings. Go to Settings then Channel and Videos. Turn on Store past broadcasts. They stay for 14 days. 60 days for partners, Turbo and Prime users.

The record button in Streamlabs OBS records the file directly to your hard drive. It won't show up online. Unless you upload it manually to youtube or something. You can't upload videos directly to Twitch unless you have affiliate status.

To save them you need to highlight them. You can select an entire video and highlight it. To do so go to Video Producer and press Highlight on whichever video or videos you want to keep. A window will open up that shows your video in a basic editor. You'll see a yellow bar under it. Move your mouse to the start of the yellow bar until the pointer changes into two arrows. One pointing left the other pointing right. Drag it to the start of the timeline. Do the same for the end of the yellow bar. Then name it or leave the title as is and press the purple Publish Highlights button. It will take a while to process. But once it's done the video will be saved permanently."

I've often been told I'm arrogant and not empathetic or sensitive to other people's feelings. It's true. I don't care how I make other people feel. It's ironic I want to be understood and for people to emphasize with me but I'm not willing to do the same. If people don't like me for whatever reason I don't care. I've never cared what people think about me. 
I often say things that can be controversial or offensive to some. But I don't care. I've spent most of my life online. I never really learned social skills like other people when in school. I just did my own thing. And in my mid to late thirties I found out I have anxiety and depression. Some days can be very difficult. Other days I feel fine.

Also why do so many FTs just zerg everywhere? You're denying Preds the chance to hunt. Soon as we get close to OBSERVE you, nothing else you turn and shoot. So the only option is to kill the team asap. Our objective is to prevent you from getting to the chopper. Not an ideal win but it's a win. I'd much rather the game go on for longer. Fourteen minutes and then maybe let you get to the chopper. But most likely not.   
And you all complain that the game is boring. You're the ones that rush through the objectives. You don't actually play. You're too concerned with doing the objectives. To hell with the objectives. Do it like in the movie. Spread out and have fun with tactics. Keep Preds on their toes. Being all grouped up and rushing is boring because Preds can just caster spam you to death and we will keep on doing it until you get it through your thick heads that the game is called Predator HUNTING grounds.
