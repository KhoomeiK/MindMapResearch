bisexual,fqhj0oe,t3_gilhii,1589377971.0,My heart broke for one of my friends after pride last year when she told me she didn't feel comfortable going to pride events and LGBTQ+ spaces anymore because she's married to a man. She was one of my biggest inspirations with coming to terms with my own bisexuality because she was always so outspoken and confident with her bisexuality from the first day I met her. It makes me so sad to see her losing some of that confidence because of the attitudes she sees in the queer community.
BisexualMen,fqhi7pl,t3_giyd0m,1589377514.0,"I only  have a please-be-gaydar, and unfortunately it's almost always wrong...

But in all honesty, there are some things that can make telling if a guy is gay or bi easier such as certain mannerisms and ways of talking. Not all gay/bi guys give off these signs and not everybody who does give off these signs is gay or bi. The only way to really be sure is if the guy talks about his sexuality or gives an undeniable sign (like directly and obviously flirting with another guy)"
AskLGBT,fpphxow,t1_fpp425s,1588802596.0,"There definitely is a big contributing factor of poor writing in the portrayal of LGBTQ+ characters and stories, but actors can still be limited in their capabilities. They are still people and are subject to unconscious biases that can affect their performance and how they interpret and act out the script they're working with. Like I said in my first comment, this doesn't mean that cishet actors won't be able to give a good performance as an LGBTQ+ character, but it could make it more difficult to bring a believable and non-problematic queer character to life.

I guess if I really get down to my core thought with this, I would say that to accurately and respectfully show LGBTQ+ characters, especially if they are a prominent or leading role, there should be somebody in some part of production, whether its the actor, the writer, the director, etc. that is part of the community. It could help a lot with creating believable queer characters, avoiding characterization that is harmful to the community, and ensuring that the stories being told reflect our experiences. 

Regardless of this, I won't turn down a show or movie that has a good portrayal of LGBTQ+ characters just because there's no LGBTQ+ people taking part in production. I would like to see more queer people working on those shows/movies, but it's still great to have stories showing LGBTQ+ characters and helping to normalize us in a healthy way."
AskLGBT,fpo4f4h,t3_gega80,1588778182.0,"I think one of the big problems with straight/cis actors playing LGBTQ+ characters, aside from it already being more difficult for LGBTQ+ actors to find work, is that it could reinforce negative ideas about already marginalized groups.

For one thing, a cishet actor will not fully understand what it feels like to be LGBTQ+ and what experiences that brings to life. They can do research and talk to people, but they still won't truly know what it's like. This could result in the actor unknowingly relying on stereotypes that have been perpetuated by society because that's what they known. There are still a lot of negative stereotypes about the LGBTQ+ community and even the ones that aren't outright negative can still have harmful effects on the community. An LGBTQ+ actor will be more likely to be aware of these stereotypes and to give a more genuine performance. This doesn't mean that cishet actors will do a bad job at portraying LGBTQ+ characters, but it might be more difficult for them to really show all of the aspects and depth of a queer identity.

The other big issue is that there are still many people that believe LGBTQ+ people make an active decision to be who they are or that they're just faking it. Seeing people who are cishet in real life play LGBTQ+ characters reinforces this idea. This is especially true with cis actors playing trans characters. It's very common to hear people talk about how a trans women is just a man putting on a dress and vice versa. When they see a cis actor playing a trans character it validates that idea to them. They know that person is really just a man, so obviously (in their mind) that proves trans women are just men and any man can just put on a dress and sneak into the womens restroom to spy and do whatever they want. This idea is extremely harmful and dangerous and has been a huge contributing factor to trans people being harassed and physically attacked. Other parts of the LGBTQ+ community face similar problems (gay conversion therapy, bi/pan people are really just straight/gay and pretending, ace people just haven't found ""the one"" yet, etc.) but in our current political/social climate I think it's most harmful to the trans community."

Hearing women use the word makes me much more uncomfortable since it isn't usually used as a slur against them. I wouldn't use the d slur because it is not targeted at me and it's not my place to reclaim it. I feel like the same should apply to queer women using the f slur.

I'm sure there are other queer men who don't see anything wrong with it though. In general I'd say read the room and when in doubt err on the side of caution and avoid using it."

mentalhealth,fkwe1h5,t3_fl0977,1584589907.0,"I can't imagine how hard this is for you, but try to focus on how strong you and your family are.

Your son has 5 respiratory conditions, but based on what you said it seems like he's built a great life for himself. He's spent 29 years growing into a great man despite the challenges the universe has given him. He is strong and he is aware of the precautions he needs to take. Think about how he will use this strength and this knowledge to get through this hard time. 

And you are strong too, even if it doesn't always feel like it. You have had to fight your own thoughts every day, something that is unimaginable for so many people. But you've made it here now having raised a beautiful family. You made it through every day of depression and you are here expressing your love and concern for your children and their families. Fighting against depression like you've done takes so much strength, and I believe that you also have the strength to make it through this.

Everything that's happening now is scary. Seeing the news about the spread of the virus and living with all of the changes that the quarantines and shutdowns have caused is stressful and frightening, but you and your family are strong and have so much love for eachother and you will all make it through together."

It's important for her primary doctor to know about her eating habits and exercise routine to be able to properly care for her, and if any medical issue or emergency were to ever come up while she is with your ex it is important that the doctors treating her have as complete of an understanding of her health as possible. This includes what she eats and what she does for exercise."

For me I had two meetings with the psychologist where he asked a lot of questions about me.

It was a lot of questions trying to see what symptoms I may have experienced and seeing how things affected  me. 

Between the two meeting he gave me a form where I had to rate how prevalent different symptoms are in my life and also gave me one for somebody who's close to me to fill out.
