Sometimes I find this sub can be a really toxic place. I'm just surprised the armchair psychologists have yet to come out of the woodwork."
AmItheAsshole,fqxggkg,t1_fqx5dt6,1589731917.0,Gotta love it when you get a window into someone's life and people assume they know eeeeverything about it. Yikes. We're witnessing a lot of projection I guess.
AmItheAsshole,fqxf22h,t3_glg09m,1589731259.0,ESH - your boyfriend behaves incredibly badly when he loses and telling him to get over himself is totally justified...but in private. Embarrassing someone in front of their friends is a bad look no matter whether they did something wrong or not. He won't learn from this.

BPD,fqa17ai,t3_ghk70p,1589210962.0,"I relate to this a lot. Its explaining this feeling to someone who doesn't get it that's the hard part. My partner was just in the room getting mad at me for being upset over ""just bickering"" and ""only remembering bad stuff"" and like.. yeah ok that's true but it doesn't help? Like you said baby steps. You're going to be ok. I believe in you. I know it HURTS but you're aware and you're trying!"
oddlysatisfying,fpwlccg,t3_gft4c8,1588965480.0,It reminds me of a Miyazaki film! Almost looks animated :)
BPD,fpgsxwr,t3_gdd8o9,1588608938.0,"Hmm. I both agree and disagree with the last idea. I feel like it could be taken the wrong way, as in taken as a free pass to put all your shit on someone else and condemn them when they can't handle it. I think it can be really difficult to know what kind of support you can reasonably expect out of a romantic partner who simply doesn't struggle with the same things that you do. 

I feel as though maybe what was being suggested is that once you've gone through a lot of healing and recovery there are certain aspects of trauma that need to be worked out within interpersonal relationships...but if you're at a place where you'd rather work on yourself alone I think thats perfectly ok too. You should never put yourself into a situation that you don't feel ready for or prepared for emotionally. I think people with BPD have the potential to get really hurt and to really severely hurt others within relationships and only you can really know what's right for you at this time.

My biggest takeaway is just maybe that even if you feel like you've worked through a lot on your own and you're in a much better place, it's still reasonable to assume that things will come up in relationships that wouldn't even emerge when you're on your own and to be kind to yourself and not blame yourself for not being fully ""recovered"" before entering a relationship."
BPD,fosqmm3,t3_g997cb,1588036032.0,It always leads back to abandonment for me. When I was a kid my mum always went overboard to throw me a huge party every birthday and I learned to associate celebration and gifts with affection/love so i expect the world every holiday and am always let down lol. Very triggering. I can only really perceive love in big gestures and extremely thoughtful planning and if I have to express that its already ruined. Not healthy but oh well.
BPD,fnc7y2k,t3_g0puu9,1586830553.0,"I'm in this right now tbh so seeing this post actually almost broke through the fugue of ""meh"". My boyfriend is currently mad at me and rightfully so becuase I've been irritable and impossible for the past few days but I can't figure out what's underneath it all and I want to be like ""hey I hate this too"" but that's playing the victim and it's not fair. All that to say. You'll get through it. Everything isn't bad (maybe)."
BPD,fl6wmd2,t1_fl6wgcw,1584885806.0,"I understand that you're trying to be helpful and present the viewpoint that no one improves without extensive work on themselves. This is true. Everyone who struggles with their mental health has a lot of work to do. However, consider whether this is something that is helpful for these people on this thread to hear. Did anyone ask to be told they're not doing enough? Nope. Sounds to me like you're coming from a selfish place. I'm sorry that you're feeling so angry. I wish you well ♡"
BPD,fl6w78d,t1_fl6seou,1584885330.0,I needed to hear this today thank you.
BPD,fl6w55m,t3_fmycoa,1584885268.0,"When I get this I feel it's because I'm reacting to my partner's moods. I think in my experience people with BPD have trouble getting past the honeymoon stage of a relationship without wanting to flee. For me its because there are only certain ways for my partner to behave that seem ""loving"" and I need to believe that I am actively being loved every second of every day...so that ""something's wrong"" feeling could just be my partner being in a mood or being around me without actively interacting from me. I usually take that feeling as a cue that I need some alone time. It's not foolproof and I still find it hard to go against a gut feeling even if I know I'll feel entirely different in an hour or even 20 minutes. I think every relationship is different though and every gut feeling is worth examining before you decide whether or not to listen to it."
BPD,fl6vqn4,t1_fl6ugy6,1584884830.0,Therapy is great. Getting help is great. Not everyone can afford or has access to real help so maybe try not coming into a safe space and shitting all over people assuming that they don't see their own faults and shortcomings.
BPD,fl6vlbj,t3_fmrmif,1584884709.0,"I mean yeah absolutely that's my deepest wish...but also no not at all. For the first time in my entire life I'm in a really healthy relationship and its allowing me to see that the things that I WANT so badly aren't necessarily the things that I need. It's really challenging to overcome the feeling that being possessed is the only true way to be loved, and it hasn't entirely gone away, but I think seeing evidence that you're really and truly loved on a day to day basis without being abused and controlled can put some of the expectations that we (people w/ BPD) have from love into perspective."
BPD,fl5kzd5,t1_fl52w4o,1584839239.0,Oof I hear you. I've been stuck inside since monday evening and I sleep late every day now. This virus has robbed me of what little schedule and motivation I had and now I'm all moody all the time lol. Anxiety and mood swings is all day everyday lately.
BPD,fl51kmu,t3_fmlmkv,1584826416.0,Yup. That's exactly what it feels like and man I think the biggest thing people don't get is how exhausting it is to constantly be on this emotional rollercoaster. Thank you for sharing ♡
BPD,fkauxee,t3_fhcoxq,1584020064.0,"I feel like this is definitely something I used to do. When I was a child even I had personalities that were named like 1, 2, 3, 4 etc and I had one that was created for mom to like and one for dad to like and one that was like one specific personality stereotype like ""tomboy"" etc etc. I think it comes from feeling like the different people in your life expect different behaviours from you and value specific personality traits. As soon as you feel truly accepted by a person I feel like all of the construed personalities just fade away around them. All that to say though, I don't think that strictly monitoring your behaviour and how you appear to others ever really ""goes away"" I think it's possible for certain people who make you feel comfortable to bring out authenticity."
BPD,fkarsg5,t3_fhaj6k,1584017844.0,"Yes this is me lol. It's frustrating though because crafting a personality isn't intentional, to the point where I almost feel it's less that I'm creating the person they want me to be and more that I'm initially kind of a blank slate that people can project onto. Its difficult for me to have and keep male friends and I've even had past relationships where I could sense that I wasn't been seen and appreciated for who I genuinely was.

I personally feel like for this kind of thing to happen, it isn't entirely one sided. The kind of people you want in your life aren't the kind of people who are going to spend months and years in your life without bothering to figure out who you really are (even if you don't know yourself!!)"
BPD,fk3nq8d,t3_fg98ob,1583840957.0,Oh yeah it's totally possible for one person to really trigger you. I personally have 2 people that bring out the BPD in me (my mom and my boyfriend) and other than that I'm very high functioning. I think it's impossible to sustain an incredibly close relationship with someone for a long period of time without having them trigger you because that's basically what BPD does.. affect relationships. It doesn't mean that this person is bad for you or that you're bad for them I just think the closer you are to someone the harder its going to be not to let your BPD affect them. That you're conscious and aware is good I would try to figure out what the specific triggers are for you in this relationship and try to remove yourself from the situation when you notice them. Being alone when you might otherwise lash out is a good way to put BPD in a corner lol
BPD,fh1cy0k,t1_fh0zroo,1581213604.0,"Oh my god this is terrifyingly close to my whole childhood experience. Any time in any kind of conflict as a child I would repeat ""I wanna go home"" through tears like a mantra, most often if I was actually in fact home with my mother. Home has never felt like home for me. I'm still searching for a place where I feel entirely safe. A place that belongs to me. I think it has something to do with always feeling like my thoughts and feelings were wrong. If someone else was right it was their space/home and since I was/am always wrong I have none."
BPD,fgjxtqj,t1_fgjtgql,1580853500.0,I wish you the best but this may not be the best place if you're working through things surrounding BPD. I'm sensing a tendency to project and I'd like to extend a friendly reminder that we (people with BPD) are not all the same and that this is primarily a safe and non-judgmental space.
BPD,fgjk7gs,t1_fgj8sew,1580845747.0,"Yeah! I guess my problem is that because of my black and white thinking I always go into an argument thinking ""I'm right you're wrong"" so if I'm presented with something that indicates my own wrongdoing that makes sense and feels correct to me then I completely switch sides and become unable to defend my side any longer. Thank you for your support!!"
BPD,fgiwz5p,t1_fgiw1lx,1580832710.0,"Thank you for your input. I'm specifically looking for input/advice from someone who has BPD and would be able to understand what this feels like on a visceral level but a friendly reminder about accountability is always good! I'm choosing to focus on that in your comment because the rest felt a little out of touch. I'm not going to report or anything but just a friendly reminder that on this sub making generalizations and assumptions about people (I.e. ""you have yet to learn a real lesson, a change in beliefs, your stuck blaming your self when your alone, yet taking no accountability when your out."") Isn't really the way to go. You don't know me or my life, only this sliver that I have chosen to share. I'm not quite sure why you're talking about ""discard"" but it seems like you've maybe been hurt by someone with BPD and I hope that you get the help and healing you need. Best of luck!"
BPD,fgiprmb,t1_fgiphpl,1580828118.0,You are valid and important ♡
BPD,fgip459,t3_eypy19,1580827675.0,"Just in case you're thinking of ""abuse"" exclusively as being hit or raised by explicitly violent and terrible people...trauma can be caused by someone who loves you so much and tries their best. Abuse can come in the form of inconsistent or conditional love. I.e. mom/dad only likes me when I'm ""good"" (whatever good means to you). If you have a good relationship with one or both of your parents, even if they are wonderful people, it doesnt necessarily mean that you weren't exposed to abusive behaviors as a child. 

Children are really really delicate and they don't understand consequences and relationships in the way that adults do. My mother was a hands-on SAHM who spent all her time with me while I was growing up. She did the absolute best job that she could. She took me on trips. She enrolled me in every extracurricular possible. She read to me and sang to me. My wellbeing was her absolute priority from birth until now (22 years later!). But still I've had mental health professionals identify her as the source of my BPD. There are things that she did, ways that she behaved, behaviors she had that were harmful to a young child. 

Sometimes if there isn't any form of traditional abuse occurring or if you're conditioned to it, or if it's coming from someone you love and value, or if it's not perceptible from an outside perspective it can be hard to recognize. You might think ""but there are people who are ACTUALLY abused"" and you might talk yourself out of the validity of your feelings but if the symptoms are there then the cause also has to be."
BPD,fginyv3,t3_eyq9wo,1580826872.0,"Hey I was just thinking about this today! I've had conversations with friends and mostly everyone I know seems to fight very rarely or not at all with their partner. I don't know whether it has to do with mental health or upbringing (i.e. seeing parents fight...even though the two things are often linked anyways) but I do think that its likely that relationships - whether romantic or platonic - are harder for us than for people who are maybe more neurotypical. 

Regardless of whether that improves with therapy.. my personal opinion is that it doesn't necessarily have to matter. Even though almost all my close relationships with family and friends and my partner can be kind of stormy sometimes and that wouldn't be for everyone.. it doesnt necessarily indicate disfunction. We're just doing the best we can with the tools we have, which are similar to that of a high functioning toddler and as long as we don't practice acceptance to the point of stagnating and continue to try and improve and grow... there's no reason why that's an inherent bad thing. 

Everyone's relationship is different and being on the lookout for disfunction doesn't mean comparing yourself to your friends. I remember when a friend of mine told me that she and her boyfriend who have been together for like 4 years have fought only a handful of times I felt so so bad and worried about my own relationship...but everyone is on their own journey and ours happens to include BPD"
BPD,fg83jh4,t3_exf46l,1580608576.0,If you push someone away on purpose and they stay then they truly love you. If they leave then they never did. Of course that's totally untrue and unfair but try telling that to our little damaged toddler hearts lmao
BPD,fg8320g,t3_exc1v5,1580608200.0,"It's really hard to let things co-exist in your mind...for example. That you may have hurt someone and been difficult to be with, but that you are also someone who deserves love/care and empathy. I know because that's my constant struggle. But all the same, those things are probably both true. The best thing you can be is self-aware and it sounds like you're well on your way. People who are conscious and concerned about the way that other people view them are generally the most liked because they're reflective and over-thinking people. I think the people around you probably appreciate you more than you know because as hard as BPD can be within the confines of a relationship, our anxiety makes us caring and attentive friends. If you can afford/make time for it I highly recommend therapy, but you don't have to ""fix yourself"" to be deserving of love. Never fault someone for not being able to handle your BPD but never doubt that there are people who won't even consider it work. I believe in you!! (Also get a diagnosis if you can because there are other things that are similar and it can be affirming to know for sure)"

BPD,fc09f3z,t3_efbc22,1577283908.0,"This was me for a really long time and I honestly think that BPD has a lot to do with it. We mould ourselves into who we think they want us to be and once that's done we become easy to use. I began to realize that I was choosing whoever seemed interested and attaching myself to them right away but also going along with whatever they wanted and then wondering why I was never in a stable relationship. 

I'm not saying to go after people because that's scary lol but if you start paying attention to what you actually like in a person instead of whoever is showing interest it becomes easier to find someone who wants to be with you in the same way. It's the most attractive thing in the world to be wanted but generally the people who only want sex are more evident in showing interest. 

This is easier said than done, but what I did was to start putting myself in situations where I was able to meet the kind of people I genuinely enjoyed being around! 

I spend years being used and hating myself because I thought I was good for nothing but sex but I've spend the past year with a really wonderful and loving partner who truly loves me and I honestly didnt think it was possible. But it is! You're wonderful and worthy of love OP and I believe you'll find it."

BPD,fb9chtm,t1_fb9cbw9,1576635027.0,Mostly no but my current partner is bipolar and oddly it's the healthiest and most fulfilling relationship I've ever had! I have had really close friendships with other female borderlines but never had one as an FP.
BPD,fb9bnhm,t1_fb9b9pj,1576634412.0,"Oh I definitely distance myself from a friend FP when I get into a relationship. Not intentionally. It's like, I'll naturally transition them subconsciously into a normal friend and either it works and we just have a little more distance or they get upset and leave my life. Out of my former FPs only one of them is a close friend still."
BPD,fb98vex,t3_ec4qak,1576632372.0,I wouldn't say that I have trouble forming lasting healthy friendships but once I hit high school my FP has always been male (I'm F) and I have a consistent habit of having a platonic male best friend FP between romantic partners--if I'm in a relationship my SO is usually my FP. So I would say that I have noticed a gender trend for myself... and I also have a complicated relationship with my mother... so I definitely see at least part of this theory making sense.

I think it's something about BPD that makes people who love us less than we love them more interesting. I used to think that I was just picky but I realized I was seeking people out and pursuing them and they may not have been the right choices. Another thing is that with BPD we have this undeniable need to please. You might be giving off signals that you want the same things that these people do from a relationship because you're modeling your behaviour after theirs. Just a thought. I know I for sure used to do that. In not wanting to come across as ""loving more"" I would pretend that all these sorts of things like casual dating and open relationships were cool with me and even my idea, and I honestly think my previous partners may have had no idea how miserable and mistreated I felt."

BPD,f89lx8j,t3_dznzqs,1574375366.0,My experience with this is that people who are neurotypical and fairly untraumatized make feel like even more of a monster in comparison. If I'm with someone who exhibits problematic behaviour at least I'm not alone. Even if I'm being treated badly. There is a balance though. It's possible to be in a stable and healthy relationship with another person who's been through hell. It's not that its wrong to be drawn to broken people. It makes perfect sense. They just have to be as self aware as you are and just as prepared to work on themselves otherwise you're just crashing and burning together forever.
