The only reason were still here is because the rent WAS cheap so we were able to save to be able to buy this coming spring and they were the only place we found that accepted our dogs. 

She literally does nothing. The apt was given to us with literal animal feces smeared everywhere, used condoms everywhere and she just told us if we didnt like it we didnt have to move in. When we visited it didnt look that bad, guess they fucked the place up extra good before moving out. The place had cockroaches, we had to deal with for months before she finally called an exterminator. It's been horrible. The regie has not taken any of this seriously. It fucking sucks.

Best bet: move. It sucks I know but the regie will do little to nothing and it will take a long time before they even look at your case. 

Drafts: we shrink wrapped our windows and bought cushion to try to keep some warmth in, did some caulking all out of pocket. We also have no working heaters in the basement.

Bathroom: same shit. No plugs, no fan. Full of mold.

The entire house maybe has 5 plugs so we established a network of extension cords and plug/unplug as needed. There are massive holes everywhere that I've tried to come with frames so it cuts the draft and looks a little more aesthetically pleasing.

Sorry this is happening to you. And sorry I'm not more optimistic."
