FortNiteBR,foot3yc,t3_g8pk05,1587945890.0,Here I am again to complain about Malice on the shop for the 6th time in a row without her Pickaxe and Wrap. I just don't know what is happening.
FortNiteBR,fodnkzu,t3_g6xz1p,1587686902.0,I thought those Neon Llama/Lion and Cat/Bunny skins would be in the shop since they were in the live show.
FortNiteBR,fo6o6yn,t3_g5womk,1587563414.0,I would die for a Phasma Skin.
FortNiteBR,fo4zvur,t1_fo4zi6l,1587514540.0,Oh I see like a mascot. Very cool indeed his design is way unique. Thanks for the info.
FortNiteBR,fo4zqw5,t1_fo4ziy1,1587514460.0,Thanks mate!

FortNiteBR,fny8a22,t1_fny7xqz,1587355887.0,"Yeah, you're right! The desert was my favorite place. I like to think we're just in the very early beginning with our new map so new things are popping out slowly, the old map was very boring at season 1 to be honest, it was a truly journey seeing how it evolved, let's hope for the best!"
FortNiteBR,fny7vki,t3_g4ln9j,1587355595.0,"Beautiful mate! Sometimes I miss Athena, this map was perfect specially around season 8~9."
FortNiteBR,fnhpmsc,t3_g1twje,1586966659.0,"Loved how you displayed Midas hands and Chaos goo stuff coming out his eye and mouth. Looks like something straight out of Hannibal, which is my favorite show.

In conclusion my dick hard."

FortNiteBR,fnbx2be,t1_fnbvin9,1586824035.0,I only use Deadpool with girly items and I think it's not only funny but faithful to the character as well! You should try.
FortNiteBR,fnbwtft,t1_fnbvh1h,1586823893.0,Yeah the old prices are a little bit too insane for my wallet as well but fortunately I got around 2k from Battle Passes.
FortNiteBR,fnbubt4,t3_g0uqq1,1586822479.0,Yesss Rainbow Smash! Now my Deadpool set is complete.

FortNiteBR,fm9nnzp,t3_ftxksy,1585872491.0,Nitelite is the kind of skin we could swear seeing every which day on the shop.

FortNiteBR,flbo545,t3_fnuxpo,1585008787.0,"They will never bring Malice's Pickaxe again, wont they? This is the FOURTH time (yes I'm counting) in a row they put Malice on the shop without her pickaxe and the wrap. Why?"
FortNiteBR,fkiwxae,t3_fis77a,1584230581.0,Ok but what the fuck out of nowhere
FortNiteBR,fjlsgky,t3_fe4obf,1583453410.0,"They should refund everyone who bought that skin earlier on, remove it and then release only one skin with all those variants."
FortNiteBR,fiwy4vc,t3_fab64f,1582807386.0,I would love if we had a green ooze ripley :(
FortNiteBR,fis6u3g,t1_fis5j26,1582679072.0,"I understand your point, but I got this screen on PS4."

FortNiteBR,filitvz,t3_f8ictv,1582502577.0,The sunbird choice on shop rotation may be due her kind of resemblance to carnival costumes here in Brazil.
FortNiteBR,fi5896l,t3_f6k0t8,1582157147.0,Third time with Malice on the shop without her pickaxe. For gods sake.
FortNiteBR,fhcblte,t3_f2a5ww,1581460140.0,I think the right questions are corrupted by WHAT? HOW? WHY? This season doesnt explain anything at all. At least on chapter 1 we got something right and there and we had patch notes which came with some info.
FortNiteBR,fgh1nzi,t3_eygpk4,1580774570.0,"Ultra Sour is one of my favorite wraps, got it last time at the shop. Looks very good ingame."
FortNiteBR,ffh0gp2,t3_etgt39,1579919802.0,My PS4 Pro is almost exploding and freezing in this Season I cannot even imagine in the near future with this chunky update
FortNiteBR,ff4mkc5,t1_ff4lp3u,1579567246.0,Did his wrap already come to the shop?
FortNiteBR,ff4mi4t,t1_ff4k46p,1579567203.0,Nice to know! Seems right after all.

FortNiteBR,fdykt3y,t1_fdyk5nh,1578780843.0,"How could they give me nothing IF I'm paying for the Battle Pass? You are being delusional. I'm not complaining about free rewards, I'm saying the old system used to give us more rewards since there were individual missions for each skin and those said missions gave us cosmetics which were not inside the battle pass itself."
FortNiteBR,fdyhjh3,t3_enao9l,1578779865.0,And it gave us way more rewards.
FortNiteBR,fdigh3q,t3_elkakg,1578442362.0,They are not in the same set although when they were released people often used them together so both the skin and the pickaxe are know commonly associated.

FortNiteBR,fbc4evh,t3_eckvzd,1576715398.0,"Remember when they said that those banner skins and items were the first of many which would use the same feature? It was 37 years ago, feel old yet?"
FortNiteBR,fb2ori4,t1_fb2oo9r,1576454919.0,Gonna try again! Thanks for the advice. Nice snap tho!
FortNiteBR,fb2om9g,t1_fb2ocef,1576454843.0,"Yes! Its basically all I ever wanted for her. There are the comics by Marvel too, they are awesome and the art from those are speechless. Man I really wish Phasma had more development on the main movies."
FortNiteBR,fb2oaw7,t3_eb70gv,1576454675.0,I want so bad to take some screenshots but replay on ps4 seems pretty broken :(

FortNiteBR,faiksg2,t3_e9fkp2,1576110251.0,"I wonder why the hell not releasing the others poll skins since they are already done and the development team put time and effort on them. I mean, they are losing not releasing them. I cannot understand."
F13thegame,f9tqq47,t3_e6otzk,1575636656.0,I really really really love this game besides every which problem it has. It was very important to me and I made strong memories playing with. It is very sad what happened...
FortNiteBR,f9tqb8r,t3_e6ndu7,1575636351.0,"Now I see how I liked the old map and the previous care Epic used to give to BR, the current situation of the game feels very outcasted."

FortNiteBR,f9ok832,t3_e68god,1575506648.0,My wallet has never been so safe since all the centuries wallets exist among us
FortNiteBR,f988cqk,t1_f987bys,1575175153.0,Man thats a bummer. I don't have them neither those pickaxes but the original one looks awesome even not being dual. It's a bit frustrating having so many cosmetics items and seeing the same ones arriving to the shop daily and when they came the set is missing parts. I really wish Epic did a better take on those selections or maybe making the shop a little bit bigger.
FortNiteBR,f9873uj,t1_f981ejd,1575174713.0,True. I really like how that wrap is clean.
FortNiteBR,f986q85,t1_f97tuso,1575174582.0,What did happen to them? Didnt remember.
FortNiteBR,f973snr,t3_e460ng,1575158645.0,All I wanted was Malices Pickaxe and it is the only thing from the set not available. Sad.
FortNiteBR,f8x5am3,t3_e2qe02,1574908617.0,I absolutely love this color scheme. Very late 90s.
FortNiteBR,f8x5361,t3_e2r4z9,1574908455.0,"Fortnite on PS4 have been atrocious since the second update after Chapter 2. Full of bugs, lag spikes, freezes and the list goes on. I'm felling Battle Royale being left behind, hope I'm wrong."
FortNiteBR,f8u1lks,t1_f8u14i6,1574816791.0,Nice to know! This is actually awesome. Ive been playing Battle Breakers a lot. Thanks for the info. Cannot wait to get him.
FortNiteBR,f8tyn2n,t1_f8s9csa,1574814560.0,Is he? Damn! Didnt know that. Makes him even more cool for me.
FortNiteBR,f8tybes,t3_e27ghm,1574814320.0,"The first community votes was excellent, but i always thought that the winning skin should come to the shop with an special price to make things better and also give the votes a proper meaning."

FortNiteBR,f8e1niz,t3_e0gqa4,1574516273.0,Totally strange we getting only one Stormtrooper skin which also belongs to a set and its own rarity but nothing else at all. I was really excited about a Cal skin and BD1 as back bling. Thats a shame.
deadbydaylight,f8dk5rt,t3_e0chwb,1574494775.0,My life will never be complete without this Ghostface.
FortNiteBR,f83bn0f,t1_f83b2z0,1574208605.0,Totally forgot about those. Its funny how currently they could easily be a selectable styles skin.
FortNiteBR,f83axby,t3_dytbko,1574208160.0,Most expensive shop yet?

deadbydaylight,f776voe,t3_dqkx7z,1573445669.0,I have never seen a Battle Pass so terrible in my life. From all the cosmetics items possible they chose fuckin keychains which isnt visible AT ALL and flooded the pass with them.

FortNiteBR,f5x5zvq,t1_f5wvrkt,1572535920.0,I am dealing with absolutely every topic on your comment. Are you having problems with emoting and freezing as well?
FortNiteBR,f5wmap7,t3_dpmdav,1572526701.0,Im having very odd similar problems on my PS4 Pro. It's literally unplayable right now for me. There are a lot of lag spikes and freezes. Even when I try to emote middle game I got stuck with no action seconds enough to get destroyed. Those zombies when they appear crashes my game as well... Its being annoying.
FortNiteBR,f5vmvcw,t3_dpfao6,1572493322.0,"Im so glad I saw this I was thinking my PS4 was dying. Yeah Fortnite is really really bad right now, cannot play without having some weird crashes/freezes."

FortNiteBR,f4kxzkf,t3_dkvp90,1571659487.0,"Not mentioning the fact that you could also get way more items like pickaxes, backblings, gliders and wraps because they were outside the battle pass in their own challenges now they are in the battle pass itself."
FortNiteBR,f4guy7y,t3_dkf9v8,1571585029.0,Anyone really liked the skins from this battle pass? I know they have a motif going on this season which is something like gi joe meets action man but its kinda underwhelming
FortNiteBR,f45qrud,t3_dje8sc,1571390611.0,I would laugh so hard if this is what happened
FortNiteBR,f450eip,t3_dj7n6t,1571362981.0,"I really really really hate how they messed up the battle pass, doesnt seen any worth it doing those challenges.
