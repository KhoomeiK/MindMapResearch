The majority of claims that *aren’t* dismissed are injuries due to the physical administration of the vaccination - basically, arm and shoulder injuries because the needle hit something it shouldn’t. 

That and exceedingly rare allergic reactions are what is meant by “vaccine injury.” (And death from those reactions is even rarer. Like in the low double digits from all the time *since they started keeping track*.) Anything else is being manufactured by people with agendas and parents in denial, like that notoriously anti-vaxx mother on social media who blames vaccinations for her child’s death... even though the medical examiner ruled it asphyxiation due to mom rolling over on her while co-sleeping."

You still have a pet owner who lets their pet go wherever it wants. There is no other type of pet where this is an acceptable practice. Cats may not tend to bite people, but they themselves are susceptible to all sorts of nasty things. 

When you get a pet, you’re making a commitment to its health and safety. You can all downvote me as much as you want, but the facts are on my side. There is a reason many shelters won’t adopt out a cat if the prospective owner says they will let it go outdoors. But hey, you go ahead and let your cats out, and enjoy treating that feline leukemia, FIV, and FHV."
worldnews,fqtugnh,t3_gkrkz1,1589646337.0,"For me it’s not even about the ecosystem. I will never understand why you would want to get a pet, love it and take care of it, and also just let it roam around outside without supervision. 

I’m not talking about, say, a farm with barn cats. But pretty much anywhere else, I find it inexcusable. You can’t do it with dogs and it shouldn’t be allowed with cats either. 

Whenever I bring this up people defend it by saying their cat is “used to” it. Newsflash, just because it meows doesn’t mean you have to let it out. Yes, I have two cats that would love to go outside and often tell me so - loudly. The answer is a closed door and the word “no.” It’s not that complicated. 

Outdoor cats get into fights, get injured, get stuck in places they can’t escape, get infections, get fleas, get taken by larger predators, get stolen, get brought to shelters by well-meaning people, and simply wander too far and get lost. Often they just disappear, but sometimes they limp home with injuries that are expensive to treat or require euthanasia. With very few exceptions, there really isn’t any good reason to let a cat wander freely. They are either house pets or wild animals, pick one because it can’t be both. 

Feral cats, of course, are a whole other problem. I’m a big believer in trap-neuter-release programs, but those cats still have an environmental impact, so I don’t have an immediate answer for that problem that doesn’t involve culling. Although stepping up TNR efforts would reduce the cat population, it might not work fast enough to really help."
