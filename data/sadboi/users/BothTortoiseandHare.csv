Yes, it's going to involve going round and round a subject comparing sited fact to misinformation until the conditioning cracks, but it will crack if you stay respectful and on topic. Might not be the 1st or 15th discussion, but the willingness to respectfully return to the discussion will ultimately win the day.

_Ex: Hillary's emails are not responsible or related to the Trump administration's Covid19 response. She lost years ago, and Trump has been in charge since then. If the rate of infection doesn't warrant mass testing, how can we know the actual rate of infection without testing?_

relationship_advice,fomz5r3,t3_g8b957,1587908158.0,"Short answer, no. He's gone too far for too long with not caring about your pleasure during sex to realize any sort of mistake without some kind sting. It's okay though, because he's 35 years old and not a child, so he doesn't need to be coddled and he won't die from hearing your truth. I suggest couples counseling. He may not like it, but you don't like not orgasming, and you're feelings are important too right? 

Also, and I know you say it feels uncomfortable, but communicating what you need to orgasm is healthy, natural, and logical to do in long term relationships. Relying on hints or suggestion got you exactly where you are, so there's nothing to lose by just being honest. If he ignores it completely, then you've lost nothing. If he hears something that might be ""interesting to him"", tries it and sees your reaction to it , then replicates it, you've made some progress?

Ultimately, because of the power dynamic in your relationship, nothing will change unless you plant your feet and stand your ground on the issue. Being crude, you want him to make you orgasm, but he just wants to orgasm. Since self gratification is a thing, there's really no incentive (other than the proven ineffective ""you're unfulfilling in bed"" and ""I don't orgasm during sex with you"" incentives) for him to conform. I'd highly suggest some couples therapy to get someone on your side in this."

relationship_advice,fo2r455,t3_g4ws1j,1587471926.0,"On the one hand, I agree with your husband to a degree. The first time out of the nest is an experience and is important in recognizing the true value of responsibility. However, I differ at two points.

The first, there should be a return clause. You don't want to baby them once they leave, as they have a lesson to learn, but it's also not a punishment. Having your son return home after trying the first time is better than seeing what the effects of homelessness and desperation do to your son's character. 

The second, and really most immediately relevant, there is currently a global epidemic. This point in time right now is different than normal and should be respected as such. The normal and sculpting struggle of survival is exacerbated by the situation, and changes most aspects of the experience. A couple of examples being moving and emergency job hunting.

Can't really ask/bond with new neighbors over pizza and beer while they help you move during a quarantine for a highly contagious virus, potentially missing out on a future lifeline. Likewise, if something threatened his position at his job, it would only be prudent to job hunt. That whole process is in flux because of this, and this is where the dangers in desperation and homelessness factor in.

TL;DR: A similar experience helped shape the man I am today, but the situation right now is different than the one I faced or your husband is remembering. If this is all happening anyway, just make sure your son knows(and remind your husband) what ""home"" means."
