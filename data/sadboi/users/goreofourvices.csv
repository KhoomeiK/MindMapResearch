None of that matters in this case. The point I was trying to make is that you're a dick. OP desperately needs help, so they come to a subreddit where trained professionals offer advice.

People that don't see a person in need, rather someone they can preach to how **insert medical thing here** is bad and they should try **insert pseudo-science here**.

That said, you need to find another doctor. Find someone that will listen to you and genuinely try to help. I can't believe that with nausea, early satiety, frequent urination, increased thirst and potential weight loss, no one thought ""Hmmm, this could be something, let's get some tests done to figure it out."" This isn't something that they should ignore, and you shouldn't either. Sometimes you need to stand your ground until someone listens to you. Tell your doctor and tell your parents that what you're going through is making your life significantly harder. Make them listen. I know how annoying stomach issues can be (and I have a fear of vomiting, so I totally get you), but this may be more that just a stomach problem.

When Edelgard was announced, I was hyped because everyone else was (I know nothing about FE lol). So I thought, what the heck, Imma spend my hard earned orbs on her. I got to 10% focus rate, which made me a wee bit annoyed, so I decided to wait until the last day. I set a rule for myself to not go below 70 orbs and save them for a ""special occasion,"" whatever that may be. However, considering I already spent 100 orbs without getting a single 5-star, I broke the rule. Oh boy, if I only knew.

If math serves me right, I spent almost 300 orbs. **300 orbs.** Not a single 5-star. No legendary heroes. **Nothing.** I reached *14% focus rate* and I had 10 orbs left. I lost so many, what is another few? I got two green orbs and both were *3-star Arthur*, as if the game was mocking me. And yes, I cried myself to sleep last night.

gaming,fk1lcs1,t1_fk1kyrs,1583781999.0,So spam and reposts don't bother you at all?
FL_Studio,fk1kxjg,t1_fk1kglq,1583781755.0,"To be fair, the solution was posted before the joke."
JustUnsubbed,fjqbrh8,t3_fekin1,1583570712.0,"I have unsubbed months ago from both this and r/damnthatsinteresting because people just upvote blindly. There was a post about a ""1 in a billion green lobster."" It was so obviously fake, and someone even linked the original image. None of that mattered though, since the post got to 10k upvotes anyway."
JustUnsubbed,fjq9n9f,t3_femk6u,1583569884.0,"I find it funny how he keeps trying to post on r/facepalm, gets called out, says he doesn't know what he's doing... but keeps posting anyway."
JustUnsubbed,fjq898y,t1_fjq6ym7,1583569419.0,"Yeah, but it still somehow got 200-ish upvotes."

fantanoforever,fjo3398,t1_fjn7gis,1583519531.0,He also seemed to be on the verge of crying when he was talking about autism in The Allegory review. I love how sincere and empathetic Anthony is and isn't afraid of showing it.

JustUnsubbed,fjijfmx,t1_fjia3z1,1583368969.0,"You're absolutely right, but what else can you do? You can try to block every account you see that has over a million karma and stay away from popular subreddits. It may not truly solve the problem but, if you like the good content that sometimes gets posted, it's probably the best choice."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fjiiync,t1_fjhyszm,1583368670.0,"I can't tell if you dropped the /s or if you're genuinely serious, but just in case... a kid who is able to experience life and utilize the brain is not the same as a developing organism that didn't even form a brain yet."
JustUnsubbed,fji647w,t3_fdjvjs,1583361231.0,"Posted by *the* karma-whore himself, GallowBoob. What a surprise.

Do yourself a favor and block him. He is a disease that afflicts many subreddits and blocking him should make your browsing less shitty."
lostredditors,fj9wge0,t3_fcakeo,1583161216.0,Can someone explain to me why is OP getting downvoted to oblivion pls
TumblrInAction,fj6yhx4,t1_fj6wb5h,1583082793.0,"Yes... Yes, it really is. You have trans people on this very sub, who are also tired from crap like this and are also met with animosity from the hateful few when their views are criticized. Even *if* there's more than a few, I still think they're not representative of every trans person."
TumblrInAction,fj6vvl2,t1_fj6uv3y,1583081283.0,"Mate, you phrased it as if every trans person is like that, which is absolutely not the case. This post just showcases a vocal hateful few and it doesn't represent every trans person on the planet."
TumblrInAction,fj35ihm,t1_fj34p3h,1582968319.0,"Yeah, the phrasing made it seem to me like the person was calling an old lady weak because she isn't fighting. Being weak simply because she's old didn't cross my mind at all, even if it makes most sense."
TumblrInAction,fj34jjp,t1_fj343xk,1582966891.0,"Oh. Yeah, that makes more sense."
TumblrInAction,fj33c5o,t3_fb7ggx,1582965166.0,"Wait, why was the old lady weak if she tried to avoid violence? I don't get it."
AskReddit,fitpnu5,t3_f9rbri,1582726506.0,"God fucking dammit, I am so tired of these sex questions reaching hot every single day. It's like this subreddit is filled with only horny middle schoolers who have yet to discover that there's porn on the internet. Fucking stop."
whatisthisthing,fithrgn,t1_fitgyw2,1582720453.0,OP is supposed to respond with that.
JustUnsubbed,fiompru,t3_f8v5wq,1582586243.0,"I thought TIFU meant ""Today I Fucked Up"" Not ""Time I Fucked Up."" And how is this even his mistake exactly? If it was the daughter posting, I'd get it. There's no ""Today"" or ""I,"" just ""Fucked Up."" It seems like the post fails to follow the basic rules. Twice. Or maybe I'm missing something?"
