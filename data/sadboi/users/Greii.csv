schizoaffective,f6uab96,t3_dt2791,1573160162.0,"It's important for professionals to differentiate a substance-induced psychosis from a primary psychotic disorder (such as Schizophrenia). If it was just a psychotic episode due to the substances, then the symptoms will disappear after days, weeks, or months. However, if it's the onset of a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia that was precipitated by the substance use then the symptoms will probably continue or come and go. 

So, after those three months, I'm guessing they'll evaluate you again. I'm glad you're symptom free at the moment, sending good vibes so that it stays that way!"
