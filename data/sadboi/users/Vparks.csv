relationships,fpgb4iu,t1_fpf5qx5,1588598934.0,"Exactly. I started dating a 28 year old when I was 21, and he was condescending about almost every aspect of my life. Movies I liked? They were childish. Music I liked? People playing guitars all sounded the same. This extended into the way I did domestic tasks too. Like he claimed I never washed the dishes correctly, or didn't put things away efficiently enough. Meanwhile he lived off of baby carrots and blocks of cheese and couldn't be bothered to clean his bathroom in the entire 5 years he lived at his appartment. 

OP, it's not that you're actually doing things wrong. It's that he wants to feel like he's better and more knowledgeable than you."

I've only gained 3 pounds since isolation began, but it's like when things get too quiet, my brain immediately jumps to ""BAKE THE THINGS"". And not even healthy things...stuff that'll make me feel better about being stuck inside with nothing but grants to write. 

So far this household has consumed: 2 banana bread loaves, 1 chocolate cake, 2 batches of chocolate chip cookies, 3 batches of scones (2 cheese, 1 English-style), and a newly born sour dough. Now that I've gotten wind that Nigella Lawson has a recipe for Olive Oil Chocolate Cake, and a myriad of delicious looking cookies...I don't know if I'll be able to help myself. 

Give me strength to put the flour away."

science,f71pc0f,t1_f6zr5ff,1573345124.0,"SDO scales can still capture people on the left though! For example, radical feminists score highly on the SDO scale, and they are considered a left group. It's just that the scale correlates more strongly with conservativism."

science,f6zc778,t1_f6z5p2r,1573314503.0,"It's a little of both! In psych, we're primarily concerned with how a measure can predict unique variance. So if a measure correlates really strongly with a different, existing measure, it's harder to say that it predicts something uniquely. However, I do believe SDO and conservative both predict other outcomes uniquely (that the other does not) which is why they are kept separate, and why SDO is still considered valid."
science,f6z5js3,t1_f6z56ui,1573309634.0,"Some researchers consider it a drawback in that there are definitely Liberals with SDO tendencies, and the scale tends to miss them.

So there I am, waiting with my boyfriend at the Lazer Tag arena, and 6pm comes and goes. And goes. And goes. At around 6:45, a friend-of-a-friend who I didn't know very well arrives, and excitedly joins us outside the arena. I didn't want to disappoint him, so the 3 of us go inside and play a couple of rounds with the kids who were there having a party of their own.

I've long since broken up with that boyfriend, but the other attendee? He's one of my closest friends.

You will find your people. And sometimes they'll be there for you when it's least expected. In terms of your upcoming birthday, I wouldn't be afraid to do something; even something low-key and accessible like a bar date would be a safe choice, while still allowing you to see people.
