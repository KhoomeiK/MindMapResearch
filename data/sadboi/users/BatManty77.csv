Anxiety,foa0wm3,t1_fo8wr50,1587636878.0,"Thank you, this really does man a lot. It's kind of a breath of fresh air reading someone go ""no what your feeling is valid and normal"". 

I really am considering staying home and telling my manager I physically cannot come into work. Because you're right and my boyfriend said something similar, it's just a job. That being said I'm already working part time (actually it's about 10 hrs a week give or take). So any idea of me stepping down is just quitting.

Also, my manager is aware I have some pretty severe mental illnesses and up until now has been the *CHILLEST* person about it, but I've also been medicated regularly since I started the job. She does quite a bit to accommodate me, things like covering for me when I have a panic attack, keeping other employees at a distance from me, letting me go home if my attack is really bad. (I've never had a manager this kind about it all). So I definitely will go to her and see what she has to say because I do think she might be able to help a little.

Sadly though, part of the reason I am the way I am currently is because I don't have health insurance. It's why it's been so difficult to obtain medication and why I can't see a therapist. So Im just kind of stuck right now.

Thanks again though, your words do mean a lot and make me feel loads better."

True of anyone of any age but I've found in life that teenage boys typically don't care too much about what other ppl want and put their goals first.
Additionally, this absolutely sounds like a ""well if we just have casual sex then she'll fall in love with me"" ploy and I have kill bill sirens about it u dnt need tht."

Coronavirus,flr8mu3,t1_flqr3dx,1585415215.0,"I work in a grocery store in an area where there have been a good amount of cases on the east coast and little is being done. Both because we just don't have the capability to do much and also because the gov hasn't really put any precautions in place. We've implemented sanitizing stations all over, bought extra gloves/masks for the public, and tried to stagger our registers when we can. It doesn't seem to be enough as there are just too many people who come in and don't care.
I've personally been out of work for a week because of illness and I am currently sitting in the local Urgent Care to be tested.... More needs to be done to effectively ensure the health safety of customers AND employees"

I'm sorry you're going through this, but know you're not alone! There are tons of us out there who get the same thing. I would suggest that you see a doctor and therapist (you can get online therapy if you don't feel safe leaving the house yet) so you get a proper diagnosis and start on a path to overcome it!"

If you delete you're account it's gone. My cousin (F11) just got finished up with the police recently about a pedo case that was left inconclusive because they had no way to track them. 

I (F22) use Discord openly albeit *extremely* carefully. It can be a very dangerous app for minors if they aren't careful. That being said ANYTHING a minor is using on the internet should be monitored by the parents, regardless."

I figured it was a feeding bite, I wonder if I startled him and that was a mixed response or something."

KidsAreFuckingSmart,fdn6zzq,t3_em4rd9,1578579014.0,"Part of the reason toddlers are sometimes better at using hoverboards is because they haven't had the time to gain muscle memory for standing yet. They're not ridged like grown people or older children. Even if they do stand and walk, toddlers are still ""floppy"" in that they still move their body in the direction they intend to go. So once they stand on a hoverboard, their bodies naturally do what's needed to control them. Albeit it's not always the safest thing, but it's neat if they have as much control as this cutie!"

As a general rule I always inspected products for customers and if it didn't look right I'd order it in for them. 
Overall you can USUALLY count on the bras, the jeans, and the intimate wear (not the underwear) to be well made. It really is such a shame though the lack of proper work for clothes they charge an arm and a leg for because they know the market is so small."

I have family that lives near where the walking dead is filmed in GA and one day I saw some of the zombie extras in the supermarket and about lost my ever loving shit.
I am kinda getting over it a little now though, O can play 7 Days to Die and Fallout games now with only mild anxiety if I play in short bursts and even watch some zombie shows/movies if they're poorly done and campy. Personally I like Zombieland and ZNation on Syfi."
