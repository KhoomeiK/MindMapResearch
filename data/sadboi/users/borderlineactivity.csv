I have been active in 5heads, awfulcontouring, bad younique, lulano, etc. for a long time. I’m ashamed of myself. It’s so fucking gross and mean. I don’t want to contribute to anyone’s low self esteem, depression, suicidal thoughts. Go ahead and defend yourselves all you want, in no world is this acceptable behavior. Especially for GROWN ASS WOMEN. I hope y’all never have thousands of people online tearing you down, picking you apart. I feel lucky it hasn’t happened to me, yet. Before you post next time, ask yourself if you would want someone to post this about your daughter, mother, best friend, and yes, even yourself. No one is immune to online bullying. A cheap laugh isn’t worth destroying someone’s self esteem y’all. Much love."
