Nootropics,fqfwniu,t1_fqfumod,1589333170.0,"Have you considered cannabis? Or even cbd? Psychiatrists love to push those meds I get it, and can see through it

I was put on xanax at 15 and took it daily until 19- once I started smoking weed, now i only smoke at night, im 23 and work full time as a preschool teacher, go to school at night and then smoke at night to come down from the day. I used to have horrific anxiety, antidepressants takes it away initially but it‚Äôs a quick fix, if you want off, you need to look inward and work on yourself. Put in the work! Meditation and breath work have helped me tremendously with anxiety and same with yoga! 

Start small, do a few yoga stretches, you dont have to commit to anything crazy, take a few deep breaths, ground yourself and focus on your senses

If you had anxiety before going on zoloft than it may return, so be mindful that you may need to work on coping mechanisms! Luckily the brain has plasticity and behavioral modifications and changing your thought patterns can help, i find reading has helped me alot with this, as well as journaling!

We have been conditioned to believe that the right treatment is a pill- because that‚Äôs where the profit is, if doctors could make a larger profit off of cognitive behavioral therapy then that would be the first course of treatment, but it is time consuming and doctors want to see as many patients as they can (notice the nice car in the parking lot? My psychiatrist just got a new tesla model x) the system is broken and unfortunately they dont do what is best for you long term, it‚Äôs sad and corrupt but true. 

So try something that makes you feel less anxious, move your body, don‚Äôt overwhelm yourself and start small, and if all else fails, weed is an excellent natural alternative to benzos üòÅ

It‚Äôs hard when adderall especially has become such a street drug and a lot of college students use it to have an upper hand at school while us with actual adhd take it to reach their ‚Äúnormal‚Äù level

I sometimes catch myself with this self image that I am a drug addict and assuming people probably think I have a drug problem because Im a chronic weed smoker and i dont hide my adderall usage. I did have a problem a few years back with taking ritalin each time I went out, probably didn‚Äôt help shape people‚Äôs perceptions of me but I dont really mind, I am who I am and I am trying the best I can.

We are adhds in a world designed for us to fail. The system is made for one type of student and we often slip through the cracks. Adderall isn‚Äôt something we‚Äôd prefer to have to take but it helps us manage in this corrupt society. We do what we can and all else we must forgive ourselves, we cant carry the burden if the world‚Äôs mistakes and we have to do what is best for us.

Like yeah I miss working, im a preschool teacher and I dearly miss my kids. But i was getting so burnt out and i go to school online on top of working full time, my mental illness have made me take off so much time over the years and now i push myself to catch up yet still have so much guilt. 

I also love that Im not feeling as left out as I usually do, i love staying at home especially in the winter and dont care to engage in social situations but still always feel left out. I love this time

Honestly though ive been thriving. Ive wanted off of zoloft for years and finally had the time to take to get off of it. 

Also I always thought I must‚Äôve had some extreme chronic fatigue- turns out I just get extremely exhausted and overstimulated around people. Ive never had so much energy! Ive been nap free since quarantine began, completely unheard of for myself!!!!"
breakingmom,fqbl48d,t3_gey9uv,1589239018.0,"Remember that kids feed off of your energy, if you‚Äôre feeling depressed and emotionally avoidant/ distant to her she‚Äôll like act in ways to get your attention. 

If she‚Äôs hurting herself it seems like she feels like she is the problem, please don‚Äôt put that on her, I had a parent like that and I am still struggling with the notion that I am it‚Äôs all my fault. Please be patient and careful of how you act around her. The ways you parent in the early years can save a lot of trouble later on. 

I understand 2s are hard, they don‚Äôt call them terribly twos for nothing. Im a 2s teacher and have 10 of them each day, trust me I get how they can be, and it can be soooo frustrating, but they feed off your energy big time. 2s are of the mindset that they now understand the world to some degree and they must be in control, dont punish, rather guide them in the right direction. 

I understand and can sympathize with what you are going through, especially at this time, but it makes me really upset to hear that you feel you need to go back on your meds because she is causing you to be depressed again. Please lose this mindset, she‚Äôs just a child, your child, your creation, please dont put this on her, this will do great damage. Go on meds if you need to, i take welburtrin as well, but taking meds isnt a quick fix and you need to additionally put in work to make yourself better, change your perspective, have gratitude for what the universe has given you. 

Try to find peace in the little things, understand that she‚Äôs just learning the ways of the world. They are smarter than you think, but they‚Äôre still babies and need to feel secure, loved and understood. Tantrums are hard, but when you teach them to understand and talk through their emotions it gets much easier, from my own experience this has worked with many children. Please also understand that children inherit your temperament, often it is so hard to parent yourself, but learn to and it will make parenting your mini versions of your easier. Think about what you were like as a child, how your parents were, what worked for you and what didn‚Äôt, then consider your own child and what they may need from you.

Please take responsibility for yourself, please don‚Äôt blame your child, she‚Äôs your responsibility, please don‚Äôt make her feel that how she acts is the reason for how her adult care takers act, this is backwards and detrimental, trust me it is, as ive spent all mother‚Äôs day crying after realizing all the pain and guilt she put on me for making me feel i was the ‚Äúproblem child‚Äù and therefore at fault for all of her problems. So please dont make your child feel like you hate her, if you do okay that‚Äôs your thing but it doesn‚Äôt need to be hers. Make things right with yourself now, work is just a distraction from yourself, look inward to find the actual problem. And no you child is not the root of the problem. 

They way you treat and act around at this age sticks with them, their brains are literally being wired now and they‚Äôll pick up on the coping mechanisms that are modeled by the adults around them. Remember that they‚Äôre having a hard time as well during this time. Just because they are young and naive doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt pick up on what is happening around them, please don‚Äôt make your child feel unwanted, it will bite you in the ass when she becomes a teenager. 

If you want her to behave a certain way, model that behavior, lead by example, dont simply just expect her to know better. Talk through reasons why we don‚Äôt act a certain way, and what we should do instead. Create an alternative, there are many simple ways to channel their exhaustive energy in positive ways.

When you treat/see your child as ‚Äúterrible‚Äù or a ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy- and she will likely continue her life at home to fit into the version you made her out to be. Especially if you are saying these things around her, children pick up on tone and context even if they don‚Äôt understand the word. She‚Äôll likely start to understand that she is actually the problem and why mommy is so mad/sad she‚Äôll continue with this trend if behavior because she‚Äôll start to believe it is what she is, especially if she isn‚Äôt shown a compassionate alternative. 

So please be patient, and figure out you own shit, leave her out of it. It is one thing to know your depressed/anxious, but learn about it, educate yourself on your own trauma, learn where your roots are, why you have the coping mechanisms you have ect. But please keep your children out of it, be accountable for you own shit. She didn‚Äôt ask to be born, she didn‚Äôt ask to be apart of you problems, she‚Äôs done nothing wrong. She‚Äôs a child, she‚Äôs growing through trial and error as we all did. If you were dealt a shitty hand during your own childhood that‚Äôs one thing- but please don‚Äôt continue the cycle."
offmychest,fq88yav,t3_gh3fbu,1589160908.0,"I feel you completely- my mother is completely egocentric and only wanted to have kids and be a mom to babies, once we got old enough I was the one who looked out for my brothers and made sure they had their shit together for school. She taught me her signature when I was young and from then on had absolutely zero interest in our lives outside of the home, while home we got to face the brunt of her manic irrational episodes, often alcohol fueled. Growing up with her was an unpredictable nightmare and emotional trauma. I started calling her by her first name at 8yo and was instantly labeled a disrespectful brat by outsiders. No one ever believed me how awful she was, or understood why I despised her, because she was so fun and outgoing and hilarious. It was always me being made out as the brat. 

I learned to be my own mother from a young age, I have a natural maternal instinct but mothers day makes me feel isolated and in the shadow. Over the years I have became a substitute mommy for so many young children who needed it, i felt a motherly responsibility for my brothers as early as I could remember. I am a mom by all definitions except I don‚Äôt have my own child yet. It‚Äôs also hard being away from my preschool students for so long. But of course my mother gets all the credit, showing her face when it benefits her or makes her look good. 

It‚Äôs hard to see social media blow up on mother‚Äôs day for people like us, it‚Äôs hard to see all these happy mothers and daughters and not feel guilty, but i was brought up to be told I was the problem, never her.

lawofattraction,fq3m90p,t1_fq06opw,1589067854.0,"Wondering what your experience is with manifesting your SP? Im new to this whole concept but it‚Äôs something that in a way ive always practiced and felt about the universe!

My SP has been my absolute favorite person since I was 15, we were best friends for years and I always felt i would marry him, ive never had a relationship or friendship where I feel the way I do with him, even now when we aren‚Äôt together and not really close friends anymore we are still drawn to each other and he has always made me feel like I am the most important person in the room to him. 

I had fantasied about us together for years, and at 21 we finally kissed one night, we walked around town for hours in the middle of the night realizing we both had felt the same way about each other for years. It was the most amazing experience, everything was magically and i was fully in love and felt it in return for the first time- but we were young, stubborn and both immature and not the best at being vulnerable and expressing what we wanted- so it lasted a week, and the last night when we were ‚Äútogether‚Äù he had told me he didn‚Äôt want to date me because he was going back to school and he didn‚Äôt want me to get jealous but wanted to keep hooking up- after years of falling into these types of situations with guys I would refuse to be in this situation with HIM and was heartbroken that he didn‚Äôt want to commit. Like I said, I was 21 and also have a history of being a bit dramatic and attention seeking when i felt hurt. I did some things I am not proud of but nothing that was too detrimental, and to begin with he had already been accepting of who I am and always made me feel loved even at my lowest. 

Im 23 now, so that was 2 summers ago. Since we‚Äôve been around each other a bunch, it took a little while but we‚Äôre not awkward or avoidant to each other anymore since all his best friends are my best guy friends, and had been initiated as ‚Äúone of the boys‚Äù i tend to be around the guys a lot and it might make him jealous, also probably didn‚Äôt help that I briefly dated one of his friends following our fallout. But since we‚Äôve both done things to spite each other, ive always done it to get his attention, i don‚Äôt condone this of my own behavior. Last summer we were at a 4th of July party and he brought his girlfriend, he would kiss her but still be watching me the whole time, my friend kept catching him checking to see if i was watching. That same day he kept telling me what a smart girl i was and telling me to transfer to an ivyl league, all while avoiding introducing me to his girlfriend- they broke up soon after. He is finishing school now and will be living nearby again. Ive never been able to get over him, i feel i have this intuition that tells me that we‚Äôll be together again. Ive dated a bunch if people since, nothing lasted, most were out of spite, and after each minor heartbreak i simply grow more eager to get back to him, even when seeing other guys nothing compares. 

Not sure if it‚Äôs my ego, or the efforts Ive done to work on myself and breakdown codependency- but up until this post I mainly saw this obsession I have with him as a key part of my love addiction, the fantasies and magical thinking, am i making him out to be better than he really is? I even have realized that I started this day dream fantasy world with him at 15, and now has likely become a coping mechanism to avoid myself feeling unloved and unwanted, always convincing myself he still loves me because he views my snapchat story

How does this play into manifestation? Or am i just adding to delusion? Im a very spiritual person yet I have a deep interest in psychology and figuring everything out. But what if i spend my energies manifesting and convincing myself we‚Äôre in love when that might not be what he wants, what if i did too much damage? 

I did wish him a happy birthday this year in march, we texted just as we used to talk as friends, he eventually stopped answering. I didn‚Äôt take it to heart because I know we both have ADHD and ive done the same to others, but it also made me feel unsure, like if he loved me he would call or he would try. Ive also been told That i am intimidating and kind of a lot so that could be a factor. I just scared to fully let myself manifesting something that can get my hopes up and possibly just feed delusion. I can rationalize why I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him, but deep down I‚Äôll know ill never stop."

I started with going if zoloft to start get to whatever ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù i can, but being 24 and essentially only being a sophomore in college after yearssss of school (and almost 80 credits that count for nothing) i cant afford to not be taking adderall, i cant get any work done whatsoever without it, and i need to maintain my 4.0 or i wont be able to afford to transfer!

But also curious to hear what your friends experience was?"
Nootropics,fpq4fbw,t1_fppj97h,1588814956.0,"Thanks for your input! My going off zoloft is supported by 2 doctors and i have been talking about it for over a year and this quarantine gave me the time to do it. Ive been essentially on antidepressants for the last decade (since i was 15) and they make me feel very trapped and clouds my passion and motivation. I always advocate for them when needed, and they have helped me come up from rock bottom, but I am of the belief that these have also been pushed on us and humans are not meant to be on antidepressants forever.

I do have a plan with my doctors that if my anxiety fully comes back once off zoloft, I would return to prozac as I prefer that over zoloft, but I stopped taking prozac cold turkey at 19 because, hey i was 19! After a manic depression away at college i came home and they put me on zoloft and welburtrin- been pretty great for years and have helped me go from a college dropout with no energy or hope for life- to having a 4.0 while going to school at night and working full time as a preschool teacher and just got my own classroom this year!! 

That being said, i had finally brought many pieces of my life together but i still felt a great deal of my inner self being clouded by zoloft, when I initially went on it i lost the part of myself that was overly confident and that loss of mindset would drag me under every now and then. My anxiety growing up was mainly physical, but after a lot of research Im starting to see that most of my ‚Äúanxiety‚Äù symptoms were essentially apart of loss of control I feel from ADHD- stemming from executive functioning. So weirdly adderall in my experience takes away a lot of anxiety for me

I am aware that i shouldn‚Äôt try things before researching, but to be fair I do consult my doctors, do a great deal of personal research and understand how the brain functions. I was using me better judgment, but unfortunately the hormone factor threw a wrench in to my trial. 

When i do see things warning of a manic episode- it doesn‚Äôt scare me, as I usually only have hypomania sometimes you need that fire under your ass to feel something for a bit, when you grow up with a bipolar parent, chaos is a craving, mood swings are somewhat comfortable and familiar, feeling strong emotions is familiar to me and i can handle it- what loses me is the agitation, and when im agitated my temper really shows and i cant be around people or even sounds 

Mentally ive been the best i have been in awhile, i have so much energy, i likely lose it all while around other people. My doctor agree i was cut out for quarantine
I do yoga every night and def will tonight, it‚Äôs just hard to get yourself to do something in the moment of pure irritability, not sure if you‚Äôre affected by this, but hormones have a mind of their own and it‚Äôs almost like I lose myself at certain times in my cycle, im makes everything else i do to make myself better seem worthless 
So yeah, dont really know if I made any sense, as my ADHD is horrendous and adderall is having little effect 
But just wanted to note that I tried this because I knew i was doing well, and I wanted to try something natural to have for the next time i fall under the dark cloud of depression, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with planning for the storm when you‚Äôre doing great! 
And i know this rant or your reading it doesn‚Äôt fix things, but in a way it helps, it helps to know you aren‚Äôt alone, and that you aren‚Äôt completely misunderstood, and that there are people who have experienced things you have before that might have some ideas, so i do really appreciate you taking the time to write it all out, it does mean a lot to lend out advice. Thank you!"

Ive been practicing yoga for years and is usually my go-to, but while in this state I couldn‚Äôt even consider doing anything without feeling overly agitated, i have had many anxiety attacks over the course of my life and this one was like no other- and also had no environmental influence to why I broke down 
Breath work definitely helped me come down from this after awhile"

askdrugs,fppcvlr,t1_fppavhe,1588799984.0,"Ive been taking adderall for years and this has never happened so severely, adderall actually helps my anxiety because it helps me focus and rationalize my thoughts for the most part, unfortunately with hormonal changes throughout the cycle adderall becomes ineffective, i think the sam-e is the problem here but cant find similar experiences others have had on the web besides people praising it which is troubling to me. Welburtrin was a godsend when I started it but after a few years it losses its spark, it also doesn‚Äôt help with ADHD as much as people like it would to, adderall has been the one thing that makes it possible for me to be in school, but it is so aggravating that my toxic hormones stop it from working, with PMDD i am very negativity effected by hormones that people usually don‚Äôt experience 
Very frustrated because i can never seem to keep my streak going of keeping my shit together, hormones make me feel absolutely helpless when it takes over for 2-3 weeks per month
Thanks for responding though sorry for the rant"

I always go into relationships hoping (and over fantasizing) for a real long term relationship- but seem to attract and only be attracted to the emotionally unavailable- which in turn ive recently realized that i too am emotionally distant and avoidant of being vulnerable about what i want. Everyone ive dated just wanted to hookup with me- never putting the amount of effort in that i did, always attracting guys who ‚Äújust want to have fun‚Äù and aren‚Äôt serious when im longing for an actual connection and commitment. I know im capable this, and have many deep meaningful connections with friends and guy friends. I seem to come off as flirty yet very intimidating to some. But also unpredictable/ dramatic. I also tend to think it‚Äôs things wrong with me when this keeps happening with guys. I also have a weird hyper fixation on dating guys I graduated high school with(im 23) and also go for the guys who tend to be the ‚Äúhot one‚Äù or the former captain of the football team. I am aware that I am overcompensating for having no true romantic experiences in hs until late senior year. I may be a tad stunted. 
Anyway sorry for the rant. But ive been working on my self/ doing inner child work along with studying my personality type. Found this group so suiting and intriguing."

zoloft,fm9r2dr,t3_ftmztx,1585874648.0,"Not sure what your diagnoses are but this is my experience 
I have ADHD, generalized anxiety, mild bipolar depression with seasonal affective disorder 
Ive been on zoloft for about 4 years and adderall for 2
I would say if you dont have depression, dont go on zoloft unless you‚Äôre anxiety on its own is horrendous 
If you are anxious due to the adderall, possibly try another adhd med, personally i smoke weed at night to come down from the adderall but in general adderall takes away my anxiety 
Zoloft is hard to get off of, any antidepressant is, youll lose motivation and wont help with adhd, way harder to stop taking an ssri than adderall in my experience, they dont say they‚Äôre addictive exactly but in reality to get off of it is at least a month of withdrawal 
Buspar doesnt do shit in my experience 
Doctors don‚Äôt always know what‚Äôs best, psychiatrist push meds because that‚Äôs what they get paid to do- ssri needs constant refill each month so they‚Äôll prescribe them to keep you coming back
Best of luck"
