BPD,fooqgxa,t3_g8ftns,1587944299.0,"I was around the age of 18 when someone (who was diagnosed with BPD) mentioned that I may have it. I looked into it and related to a lot of the symptoms, but kind of shrugged it off at the time. I had struggled with depression since the age of about 11 or 12, wrote a lot of dark poetry about dying, started self harming when I was 15, was very emotionally volatile, but I was also very outgoing.

In 2016 when I was 23 I finally sought help for my mental health. I started seeing a NP Psychiatrist first. She diagnosed me with bipolar simply because my mother had it. About a month after seeing her I attempted to take my life for the first time. I didnt seek help and I survived, so the Monday after I reached out to a therapist. I saw him for the first time the next week and we briefly discussed BPD. He would later tell me he didn't officially diagnose me with BPD for over a year because he didn't want me to deal with the stigma attached to the label. That same year he diagnosed me on paper (2017) I would attempt to take my life again and ended up in the hospital. They discharged me with ""mood instability"" but hid BPD in the diagnostic codes. The first time a psychiatrist straight up ""diagnosed"" me with BPD on the spot was when I was inpatient the first time this year, January 2020. The psychiatrist started going through the 9 diagnostic criteria with me and I had to stop him and tell him I had already been diagnosed. I ended up doing an outpatient program and the psychiatrist there was trying to figure out if I was bipolar or not (because I had been diagnosed as both). I ended up back inpatient because I became very suicidal very fast and when I went back to the outpatient program my therapist and psychiatrist there both told me I was definitely BPD. Which was both a relief and a horror because I had, in my mind, become that ""stereotypical BPD person"" when for years I had been more of a quiet borderline type.

There's a good chance my father has BPD and my older brother, but neither of them have been diagnosed with it. My father never will be as he doesn't seek help for his mental health, but there's a good chance my older brother might be because he is in the process of seeking help for his mental health.

Right now (at the age of 27) with a decent cocktail of medications and DBT under my belt I am doing much better than I was earlier in the year, but it's something that takes constant work. However, I am decently stable at the moment and willing to do the work - which is a major component into whether or not someone gets ""better"". 

Edit: So focused on the questions, I forgot to mention that I am terribly sorry for your loss."

I'm sorry you had that experience though, it sounds absolutely horrifying. I have also had experiences where I've been in crisis, gone to the hospital (the same one as the first time) and by the time I've gotten evaluated the crisis has passed and they've sent me home.

BPD,fo838m0,t3_g68t0s,1587589119.0,"So January of this year I was suffering from dysphoric (or mixed) mania. I was extremely exhausted and suicidal. I wrote down everything I was feeling to read to my therapist. That night I got the best sleep I had gotten in a while. The next day, I read my novel of feelings and experiences to my therapist and the moment I finished he told me I had to be admitted. He would not let me leave his office. 

Thankfully he was able to call one of the best hospitals in the area (because I had had really bad experiences with my last involuntary inpatient stay at a local hospital). He allowed my wife to come pick me up and take me to the hospital instead of having me taken by ambulance. I was nervous and scared because my last experience had been terrible.

This was totally different. Everyone was there ""voluntarily"" (except for a couple of us who were mandated by therapists/emergency rooms but even we had to say we were going voluntarily). The groups that were run were actually helpful and all DBT based. The psychiatrist met with me every day because I still wasn't sleeping. I met with a therapist 3 times a week. The staff were all very friendly. We got to go for daily walks outside (scheduled) and we also got to walk outside to a different building for meals and another building for arts and crafts. 

Eventually after many medication changes, I started sleeping again and my mood became more stable. 

I was discharged into the care of my providers and my psychiatrist screwed up my medications. I ended up going to the hospitals Intensive Outpatient Program. I was thrown into another crisis situation and I went to my therapist in the program and asked to be readmitted because I was highly impulsive and suicidal again. The second time around wasn't as great as the first time around, they had a psychiatrist change during my stay and my therapist didn't know what to do with me, but it was still very helpful. 

At what point should you consider hospitalization? This is different for everyone. For some it's when they barely get out of bed because their depression is completely debilitating. For others, it's mania based - you're not sleeping, you're irritable, you're doing too much, for others it's you're constantly suicidal, you have a plan, or you're incredibly impulsive. Other times people go in for medication changes just because the medications they are on are so intense and withdrawal could prove disastrous.

Basically you have to know yourself and what they call ""red flags"" - these are the behaviors and feelings that alert you to the fact that your mental health may not be as great as it could be. For me it's irritability, not sleeping, constant suicidal ideation with intent, isolation, impulsive behaviors. What do you think yours are?

That was a tangent I'm sorry. 

I think if you feel passionately about social work and about helping others, you should totally jump in and just be as honest and open about your experiences as you can while understanding and owning your whiteness and white privilege.
