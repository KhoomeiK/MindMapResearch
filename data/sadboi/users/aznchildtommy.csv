headphones,f9wsd3g,t3_e739g4,1575697984.0,"Waaaaiiiiittt a second. So how are they compared to your Sony WH-XM3? 

I bought mine and had that initial sense of euphoria and just kinda felt like I heard music in a way I never have before. My ears were almost having an orgasm listening to music using TIDAL’s app where they provide lossless music. The details were immaculate.

I didn’t think it could get significantly much better. Is it primarily the bass when it comes to difference of audio quality?"
TopsAndBottoms,f9plu1m,t3_dwtmd9,1575541698.0,"[GOOD]

- Rimming is essential. Vary pressure with tongue. Unbeknownst to some tops, some bottoms are really sensitive. I enjoy, even more, the slightest graze of his tongue on my hole. Sends me over the edge when a top combines that with kissing my cheeks, not ignoring all the surrounding area.
- Tease his hole. Let him feel how hard you are. Slide your dick between his cheeks. Personally, feeling a guy’s hard dick slide against my taint or balls or dick inadvertently is so incredibly hot.
- Make him feel really wanted. Kiss his neck and back when you’re fucking him here and there. Rough fucking is hot, but sometimes a little sensual fucking is even more hot.
- Let him know you’re enjoying his hole, if genuine (makes him more aroused / more aroused bottom = hotter sex for both)
- Start off slow. Sometimes bottoms have to adjust and acclimate before being able to even enjoy it, otherwise it can be just psychologically, and not physically pleasurable.
- Varying speed also works. Kept at a constant, you become a little desensitized. Your nerve endings just adapt to the constant. Sometimes deliberately going really slow allows your bottom to feel every inch and every curve and vein of those inches. Can really get them off.

[BAD]

- Aggressive rimming
- Going straight in at 90 mph
- Overly condescending in dirty talk
- Being void of any sound, whether it be moaning or heavy breathing even. The worst crime is being a silent cummer
- Force fucking when your bottom says slow down, or hold on. Some tops either seem to enjoy that or thinks the bottom is just fake saying that to be coy
- Fucking like a robot in a monotonous position"

I think it’s hard to remain optimistic, I know this, but you still have to.

I stand by the notion for myself that I have to stay strong in order to help other people in a way I wish I could be helped and supportive. So maybe that’s ask another thing that helps me too."
depression,eqs4yt8,t3_bzc9jt,1560276821.0,"Everybody in this same boat, I urge everyone to remember that the moment and feeling *will* pass. It may come back, but it *will pass*.

Sometimes I can get so overwhelmed by the depression that everything seems so useless, bleak, and absolutely despairing.

But making peace with the fact that it’s okay to have bad days, it’s helped me tremendously.

I’m not complicit with the situation but rather be conscious and create both a realistic and positive voice and remind myself in these moments when everything seems so dark and heavy.

I personally heard this from RuPaul — how we all have an inner saboteur. That inner saboteur is a voice that always tells you you’re insufficient, inadequate, and other things. Some people have it better, some worse. But for the ones who have it worse, it’s important to balance it out by creating a “cheerleader” that also feeds you the good things to off put it.

And remember, it gets better!"
antidepressants,eqs442y,t3_bzdzz5,1560276263.0,"Can I just recommend this book? It’s called Mind Over Mood, it’s a cognitive behavioral therapy workbook.

I believe that meds are only suppose to be used as a supplementary in an entire regime, which includes therapy to guide you.

I think as depressed people, we can be easily lost — and having a professional outside of ourselves to guide us is important.

I personally believe besides from “chemical imbalance”, our thought patterns and subconscious play a huge role.

So if you can’t afford the psychiatrist or therapist, seek out other things like this book to help you through the process. I believe it can give you a few tools or practical ways of managing your thoughts and emotions.

Best of luck and I commend you acknowledging your struggles and doing what you can to get better! Which, it will!"

But even determined by these ethical doctors, there’s no such said scans or quantitative tests that show an *absolute x* that needs *absolute y* to treat the depression accordingly.

Sometimes it’s a shot at the dark, and the patient who may have some sort of genetic susceptibility to the mental illness may not even know if it’s working for them as it should be, only trusting the doctor to continue taking the meds without question.

And that’s where I come to a conflict at the situation."

antidepressants,ep8mifg,t1_ep4o9wl,1559096904.0,"So it seems like to me, your level of happiness or maintaining something that is manageable *consistently* is indefinitely reliant on the anti-depressants?

My own humble opinion, or hope, is that you possibly can overcome it given the right circumstances. 

I think for me, when I quit — I have just never have done it at a stage in my life where I have general good stability with the most optimum circle of support surrounding me to help me stand on my own two feet sans medication.  There’s always so many factors at play that work in a way where it weighs down on me, allowing the depression to come collapsing onto myself again.

But even though I’m aware of that, I personally will still persevere and try stubbornly."

antidepressants,ep8lfix,t1_ep8jpka,1559096480.0,"I agree with both, but more interestingly, the first point. I myself don’t know enough, but I do know the brain and our nervous system is ridiculously complex. And when it comes to the psychological aspect of our brain, its a very abstract idea to me. Something so abstract that it’s really hard to quantify in a way that is concrete, and ultimately, that leads to only speculations/guesses/hypotheses.

I also have a very strong conviction that everyone’s reality, or its perception of, is entirely different (obviously), but to reduce/deduce the common symptoms of negative feelings and emotions into one single disorder of depression, implying that it’s similar enough to have the same medical treatment to treat it is a little absurd given the nature of complexity with individual minds. 

It’s why I wish there was enough testing to show me facts and numbers in a way that shows me the medication is catered in the most optimum way to treat my unique depression, whether its genetic (internal) or external factors. I’m really not good with words or explaining things, but I hope that makes some form of sense."
antidepressants,ep4gs3r,t3_b6r3wj,1559039843.0,"1. Sertraline 50 mg

2. Low libido —> low confidence —> caught up in head during intercourse —> erectile dysfunction —> repeat cycle

3. Sex shop has these “sex shots” that are mimic the effects of Viagra & Cialis very well. Can be found on Amazon known as “ManFuel”. Could take only half a bottle for full effect.

4. Temporary fix, but after taking the ManFuel here and there — after some time, it allowed me to confidently and comfortably enjoy sex again. After some time, maybe 3-4 months and over the course of 5-6 bottles (10-12 doses) I was able to build a better, positive relationship with sex. What felt like was natural, it just came back to me and I was able to have sex without even thinking or feeling any of the sex-detrimental effects of the anti-depressants. Ultimately, I concluded that yes, it is a side effect, but it compounds psychologically as well. The subconscious can affect both negatively, or positively."
antidepressants,ep4fcl0,t1_ep472dj,1559039107.0,"I haven’t been able to experiment as much as you have, but I’ve tried Sertraline alone and with the combination with Wellbutrin, and then the last one I quit was Escitalopram. I have to say, the Lexapro was the best out of it all. Whether it was my second time on the rodeo or because of the medication itself, I seemed to do better on it, but I just... still wanted to quit. I guess I thought I was ready and pulled the trigger prematurely.

Perhaps, really, I was DETERMINED to be able to conquer this on my own. The thought of being on antidepressants was depressing in itself. I also convinced myself that I needed to deal with my emotions and feelings raw without relying on foreign medication to the body. And as I read your comment, I almost feel naive now that maybe antidepressants really do play a crucial role for many people.

I just fear the dependence ultimately. I fear missing out on what it could maybe be like without my body and brain being artificially altered. I fear unknown long-term effects within my brain’s nervous network.

Currently, I’m trying to find a therapist with the medical and psychological knowledge to help guide me through this process and help me better understand my depression both medically and psychologically. In hindsight, I probably should have successfully seeked one out prior to quitting, but it’s hard to find a good psychologist that is covered through my California “medi-cal” insurance, alongside the combatility factor as well.

In any case, since I have already quit, even though I’ve been having many bouts of emptiness and despair — I’m convincing myself that I’m gonna be okay. And that it’s only normal that I feel this way and that it’ll be temporarily.

It absolutely sucks to be cursed with depression whether it’s inherent or brought upon by whatever traumas in life. But... this is my first post in this forum, and it’s great to know there’s many other people who go through the same thing and can understand.

I’m glad that it works out for you though. I think I decided to quit at the wrong time even though with the best intentions. Financial issues & finals season doesn’t help one bit lol"
