Which one to get depends on how large loads you expect to have, the size of your array and the size of your battery bank. The controller will charge the batteries from the PVs, and has an undervoltage cutoff for the loads so you don't accidentally damage the batteries. They typically autodetect 12/24V. You can then buy a 12/24VDC -> 115/230VAC inverter for stuff that can't run on DC. [Otherpower.com](https://otherpower.com/) has some more useful information."
