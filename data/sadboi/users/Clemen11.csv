Yo recomendaría buscar un terapeuta cognitivo conductual. Suelen tener tratamientos más rápidos y al grano, pero los psicoanalistas (voy a decir algo re controversial en este sub, pero en este caso me parece acertado) suelen ser bastante sólidos en problemas de la índole sexual/erótica, así que también considera terapia por ese lado. Estás en la capital del psicoanálisis, así que eso encontrás seguro."
argentina,fr5s1jj,t3_gmpzdu,1589913696.0,"Okay. Primer paso para tratar esto es reconocerlo. Ahí vas bien. Después recomiendo una consulta con un psicólogo o psiquiatra. Empezaría por un psiquiatra, y éste va a ver si necesita derivarte a un psicólogo. 

Lo que te puedo recomendar es que evites ver cosas donde niños queden sexualizados (child beauty pageants, algunos animé cuestionables, inclusive algunos programas de Disney, por ejemplo), y que busques controlar tus necesidades sexuales apuntadas a los chicos. Cuando sientas una urge para hacer algo, intenta canalizarla. Por ejemplo, yo tengo una persona que me cae mal. Muy mal. Cuando pienso en esta persona, en vez de ir a reventarle la cara, hago pan, y me desquito amasando. 

Busca cosas que te ayuden a controlar y canalizar estas necesidades que puedas sentir. Un profesional de la salud mental va a ser muy importante en ayudarte a encontrar estos mecanismos. 

Es muy valiente admitir esto, no sólo a vos mismo, sino a otros, y buscar ayuda. Espero que la encuentres. Te deseo lo mejor."

relationship_advice,fqvck6x,t1_fqtujk3,1589674402.0,"This reminds me of the story I read about a med student who was doing their pediatrics residency at a clinic, when they got an antivax parent as a patient. The antivax mother said, in essence, that vaccines are a tool for the government to mind control children (typical conspiracy theory stuff), to which the med resident decided to contact his supervisor about and explain the situation. The resident mentioned they saw a look in the doctor's eyes, who then said ""watch this"" (in a tone that I like to imagine resembled [this](https://youtu.be/fPNdWnwuBDI) video), before both him and the med resident walked back into the clinic. 

The doctor then proceeded to say something along the lines of ""the idea that the US government is using vaccines to mind control people is a fake propaganda campaign started by the Chinese government to weaken the American population's immune systems so that their secret use of biological weapons via chemtrails can be more effective."" In a dead pan, super serious tone. 

The lady left the clinic with a modified vaccine schedule for her kid. 

If your boyfriend is anything like this, you will either get him to understand that he should stop psychoanalising every single fucking thing you do, or you'll learn something about your boyfriend that maybe he didn't know about himself. I wish you the best!

Also, I am a psychology student, coincidentally studying Freud right now. Psychoanalising everything is counter productive. Not everything has a subconscious meaning. The way you tie your shoes, or which side of your teeth you brush first won't reveal much of you. That is what you're used to doing. Period. To quote my fantastic psychoanalysis I teacher, ""some Freudian psychologists are more Freudian than Freud himself. Even Freud questioned his theories and tried to evolve them, instead of sticking to the dogma.""

Also, Freud warned heavily about the absolute dangers of both analysing others without being analysed yourself, and about analysing without proper training. There's also the risk of over analysing everything, and assuming that your interpretations are always right, and insisting on them instead of checking with your patient. Freud's close colleague, Sandor Ferenczi (who other psychology students will give me flak for even mentioning him, but that is only because they didn't study him) mentioned that any interpretation should be presented with an ""I think"" or ""as I understand it"" before or afterwards, as the therapist does not know the patient as well as they know themselves, and sticking to your own interpretation instead of the patient's is a clear cut sign that you need therapy yourself. To put a Freudian joke into this, ""check your narcissism.""

The book ""A Man's Search For Meaning"", by Viktor Frankl - a book that should be read by as many people as possible, due to its historical significance, in my opinion - shows an example of someone attending a session with Frankl, after starting psychoanalytic treatment with a clearly incompetent analyst. The patient was unhappy with his job. The therapist, for five years, insisted that the patient was unhappy with the job because he had to respond to authority figures, which reminded him of his father, and he hated his father subconsciously, so he needed to reconcile himself with his father.

When Frankl got this patient after the previous psychologist was stuck for five years, and heard all this, he simply suggested ""why don't you find a job you like instead?"". Two months later, the patient was considerably happier in a new job. 

I got a bit side tracked there, but what I meant to show is that your boyfriend is neither qualified, nor competent as an analyst, and should not attempt to be one, because it will be wasteful both to him, and to everyone else. Also, I will finish my ramble off with the following phrase. 

""Analysis outside of a session is an act of aggression."""

The political banners hanging from all the balconies, the political posters pestering the walls, the incessant political indoctrination by some teachers (one being our current president, for example). All that made me decide ""fuck this"" and I went to study someplace else. 

Currently, I attend a religious, traditionalist, right leaning University. I lean a little to the left, definitely non traditionalist, and absolutely non religious. I get away with holding beliefs so different from the university's ideal, because I have freedom, which is actually rather unexpected coming from the place that, politically, isn't the most keen on my ideals. 

That said, both my university and I agree that collectivism can be detrimental to society, as seen with populist movements from the Twentieth Century (Nazism, Facism and Communism being the clear examples), as undermining the individual freedom and individual identity of a person to foster a collective idea fueled by a victim/perpetrator idea is gonna be detrimental, as people tend to waiver individual responsibility and get the worst out of them, as Lebon (a sociologist from the turn of the 19th century studied) pinpointed."

Edit: I wanna mention something. Cotorras are a plague animal that destroys crops and habitats of other animals, so technically, even if my joke wasn't a joke, setting a cotorra nest on fire (which could sometimes hold up to 60 or 70 birds in them, since they have collective nests) could potentially be an ecological and environmental benefit overall. Here in Argentina, there are some natural predators, but as of right now, cotorras are outbreeding the rate at which caranchos and chimangos are picking them off, causing crop destruction and displacement of other animals due to resource competition, putting some other species at an increased risk of habitat loss, and they also harm some of the trees they nest on, as their nests can weigh close to 90Kg in some spaces. 

A good example of why this lack of natural predators is dangerous, is Spain, where someone imported cotorras back in the 70's and they have been reproducing wildly and destroying local trees due to their nests, displacing local animals, wrecking fruit trees, and sometimes caving in roofs due to their nest weights."
