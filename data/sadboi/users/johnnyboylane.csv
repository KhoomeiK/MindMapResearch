depression,es6yin9,t3_c614t6,1561660094.0,I've found that minimizing the amount of times I do it has been key. Otherwise I just feel more and more like shit.
depression,es3uyf8,t3_c5psr2,1561571174.0,"Somebody put it to me this way the other day. ""I guess we're in for a long fight with our brains, but it's one worth having.""
I constantly feel the same way. For me it's been working on shutting down that part of my brain. I've been doing mindfulness meditation and it's quite the challenge but I think long-term it should help me work to better live in and enjoy the moment.
Hope that helps!"

As a religious person myself I shudder at how your own parents treated you.
I can assure you we are not all like that.
I just want to let you know that you are truly loved by so many. Now I can say that includes me and if there's anything I can ever do to help you, please just let me know."
