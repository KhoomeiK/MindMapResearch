AskReddit,fq0jflr,t3_gg63my,1589032803.0,"Last year.

I was about to graduate college and I was finishing off my classes with a study abroad trip to Italy.

It was supposed to be awesome, I would brush up on my Italian, eat good food. The works.

But shortly after getting there, I felt physically terrible. I was getting really winded just after going short distances or going up stairs. And I felt crazy pressure in my chest.

After a huge breakdown, I ended up going to the ER thinking I would die.

The story is a lot longer but I'll try to sum it up. I basically had Generalized Anxiety Disorder and it was causing my body to go crazy with red flag symptoms. Which only added to the anxiety.  I had never suffered so much in my entire life. It single handedly ruined the trip.

It even persisted for several months after I got back. After a few trips to the ER on bad nights and several months of therapy, and meds, I'm finally feeling normal again. But it really opened my eyes to mental health.

Tldr: brain go boom for half a year. Not fun."
