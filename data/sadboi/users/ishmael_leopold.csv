Futurology,f76hf2f,t3_duhbp3,1573428052.0,"I never understood the investment in hydrogen. Ever since the Tesla Roadster came out, it seemed obvious that battery tech had arrived and that the future would BEV. Like, what's the sense in building out a separate hydrogen infrastructure if you can just work from an existing electrical grid instead?"
climate,f7669ni,t1_f764yok,1573423673.0,"I agree that the case for human extinction is dramatically overstated. If history tells us anything, it's that people will always look out for themselves, no matter what happens to the living things around them. Some of us will survive. We'll just be living in a deeply broken, violent, demoralized world. And there will be no serious hope of recovering what we lost. I also agree that it's probably too late. Not because we lack the technology, but because we are socially/morally incapable of preventing harm. As a society, we're not actually capable of greatness. We'll continue to do nothing because at the end of the day, we're not capable of caring proportionately. We'll just do what our ancestors have always done -  make problems, deny they made them, die smiling and leave their kids to live with the consequences."

We just think they are because we move the goalposts to wherever we happen to end up and write self-congratulatory histories. The transition to clean energy will happen exactly as quickly as market forces dictate, and no faster, because the dumbfuck public can't care about things that don't affect them today. They won't tolerate the deep changes needed to stave off disaster, and they'll go smiling to the grave, believing to their bones that they were good people and the libs were wrong, as they toss the keys to their children and grandchildren condemned to live in the world their ancestors ruined. There won't be public action, and there won't be justice. There never is."
climate,f762ego,t1_f75v9o9,1573422016.0,"I don’t understand why you think that a historical precedent for our rate of warming which suggests that the extinction of 90% of life on earth is possible doesn’t justify extreme worries. Our civilization has never gone through something like that. We’ve never had to feed eight billion people under those conditions. We’ve never had to feed anyone under those conditions. We’ve never needed to safeguard hundreds of latent-Chernobyl nuclear reactors under those conditions. And assuming some of us make it through the other side, which we probably would, what kind of world would we be left with? It took 10 million years for biodiversity to recover after the KT event. On a human time scale, that means never. Tens of thousands of human generations will be condemned to live in a sour, breathless ecological blast crater because 3 generations of human beings couldn’t be bothered to prevent it. That’s why people are blocking roads. That’s why people are worried."
