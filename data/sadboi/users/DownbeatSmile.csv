I'm more than happy to give my name when calling (or being called) - in fact it's one of the first things I do when I pick up/am put through. I don't even mind giving my surname out on the most part.

In fact, when he said it had happened, I was incredibly dubious and my first question was ""Can you provide any source for that?"". I let it slide, because I had brought the topic up I accepted I wouldn't instantly be able to pull up a source for a conversation topic someone else had brought up, but I also didn't accept it.

&#x200B;

I didn't ""play"" myself, because I didn't admit he was right. I also said I didn't believe his claim and I'd need evidence of it before I'd believe it myself. This was an informal conversation with a stranger on the street. I had somewhere else to be, so the conversation didn't last more than a few minutes, but I wanted to look into it more later. If he left that conversation thinking he ""got"" me, then fair enough, but he didn't.

Note: If you're talking about ""you"" in a general sense, fair enough, but don't assume I ""let this guy win"", just because I didn't immediately call bullshit on a claim I didn't believe."
