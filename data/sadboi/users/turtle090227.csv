I think reassurance is important, possibly try get her into a sensible eating regime. Discuss body positivity around her . Talk about her friendships ( a lot of the time its peers have an influence) . I remember as a kid I used to be told I had to go on the bottom of the piggy back, and it‚Äôs the little things that usually play on your mind."

MDMA,eyjviix,t1_eyjv7ks,1567129387.0,Yea I guess it was a dumb title. Also because of the fact I‚Äôm a girl it probably is killing me off easier than if I was a man. But I was wondering if anyone had any similar experiences to me really... I guess I may have to give it a miss but I feel like I need to. Sort of like an addiction but I‚Äôm in control . It‚Äôs difficult to explain :/

MDMA,eyjs0ww,t1_eyjrk9p,1567126699.0,:) glad to help. Try to persuade ur friend not to aswell! He doesn‚Äôt wanna be fuckin up his life for 5 hour buzz it‚Äôs just not worth it.
MDMA,eyjr0c0,t3_cx7s5v,1567125925.0,"So not worth it!! You‚Äôre completely asking for trouble , and you are totally not a pussy for not doing it... in fact  you are the smart one. MDMA is the hardest thing to act sober on, your jaw is swinging left n right and your pupils are massively dilated. If you want to be caught by your teachers or snitched up by your friends go ahead. But remember you will be able to do all of this soon anyways. If you are curious about the drug take it at home, play some music you enjoy and have a dance in your room in peace. Taking at school is asking for trouble. It‚Äôs legally required for teachers to report drug use to the police so unless you want them at your door, do the wise thing. Don‚Äôt let friends peer pressure u , ur better and wiser than that !"
LSD,exgpo3y,t3_cspoda,1566270733.0,Easily i wouldn‚Äôt stress. Just relax and you‚Äôll be fine
