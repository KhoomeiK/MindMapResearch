I’m tethered to my ex until my son is 18 because of child support. If it weren’t for those measly monthly payments, I would be able to move out of state or out of country (my ultimate goal) without issue, but I’m stuck where I am for at least another 9 years."
depression,fliwddu,t3_fotwll,1585192355.0,"I actually disagree with your sentiment, OP. I have chronic depression and I’m a recovering addict. I am almost 7 years clean now, been on a medication (that actually works!) for 6 years, and have been in therapy for 5.

I think the problem is that your classmates aren’t verbalizing what they mean accurately. 

I TRULY WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE that fighting depression and other mental illnesses day in and day out is the BRAVEST and STRONGEST thing a person can do. I have tried and failed suicide a few times, have been in drug induced psychosis, lost the ability to even make dopamine (due to extended drug use on top of the crushing depression) and honestly, I’m so lucky my attempts failed and that I was able to hang on by my fingernails through all that shit. I’ve fought basically every day of my life to get where I am now and I am SO goddamn strong for getting here. I’m also immensely proud of myself. My life is beautiful these days, despite still having to wrestle with my depression daily. It’s not nearly as big of a beast as it used to be. I’ve worked everyday to fight and be bigger than my monsters. 

Essentially, I think the way to look at what your classmates said is “fighting depression takes courage, strength, patience with yourself, and a whole lot of determination (and definitely some luck)”.

I totally get your anger and it’s valid, but try to reframe it as a positive and a compliment!!! Calling a person weak for not being able to continue on is of course offensive, but I think oftentimes “Normies” don’t understand how difficult it truly is. For us, suicide can seem plausible and like the only true solution. It’s not, obviously. But making the decision to fight day after day to get to where everyone else is anyway is fucking BRAVE and REAAALLLY HARD. So it makes sense that normal people see it as “weak”. We’re at war with our own brain constantly and most people don’t know how exhausting that is! 

Rather than be angry about it, realize that YOU ARE STRONG AS FUCK! Everyone who fights mental illness is WAYYYYYY fucking stronger than normal people!!!"

Parenting,fk6kfcn,t3_fglwne,1583904927.0,"First of all, you said you don’t have the brains for school, yet your grammar is perfect and you articulate your thoughts beautifully. I’m a young mom. I dropped out of high school, had my son at 18, worked retail for the longest time and now I’m 27 & finally getting my degree (yay) but FYI most people in college are dumb as hell. Like way waaaay dumber than me, a single mom who didn’t finish high school. I can tell just by reading this post that you are PLENTY smart for college :) 

Second- YOURE AN AMAZING PERSON. Taking in your cousins kid to keep the lil babe out of the system is an EPIC choice and says a lot about you as a person. You’re already leading by example, even if she doesn’t know it yet!

Third- other than having basic needs being met (food, health, cleanliness etc) kids literally only need love. No one knows wtf they’re doing. Anyone who tells you otherwise is a goddamn liar. If you love that baby and do your best, you’re winning! Parenting is the HARDEST job and it literally never feels like you are doing it right, but as long as you care (which you obviously do) and you love the kid as much as possible, you’re going better than a lot of parents. You’re not going to mess her up, promise. 

Fourth- guilt about being a working mom and missing a lot is honestly the plight of the modern woman. It sucks so much, but it’s necessary and she will thank you for it!!! When she gets a little older she’ll be happy to have the socialization daycare brings, and you’ll be happy she has a routine, and is able to get her energy out during the day :)

You’re doing great. I know it’s hard- but try to lift yourself up. Being a young single mom is TOUGH. My parents were abusive assholes, so I get how isolating it is when you can’t rely on family, but try to be your own cheerleader. You deserve that from yourself!!! If you ever need someone else to remind you how fucking awesome you are, I am literally always here for my fellow women, especially when they’re as badass as you."

The way he talks shit about you now only proves your point that he was far too emotionally immature for you. Never let someone tell you your standards are too high, that only means they’re too high for that person specifically. You know what you deserve and what you need. He was incapable or unwilling to give it, and that’s HIS problem, not yours.

Ephebophillia is a term used for people with a strong sexual preference for people in their late teens (15-19) and I don’t think any person without this predilection would want to date someone so vastly inexperienced (in life) than them. I mean, I’m 27 and 16 year olds are literally cringeworthy to me. I find them awkward (both socially and in their own skin because THEYRE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED YET) and the thought of being sexually attracted to someone so much younger is revolting. What could I possibly talk to a 16 year old about? How could I relate to them intimately?

KindVoice,fgbc8bz,t3_exfojl,1580660532.0,"I think location can make a big difference! Is there some sunny window nook you can sit in to study? 

If you don’t mind my asking: what kind of relapse are we talking about? I’m an addict and I used to use uppers which I would correlate with things like studying for the first couple of years of sobriety. If we’re talking addiction, I’m a big proponent of taking ALL risk factors out of the equation for at least the first year of sobriety, which includes school. I put school on hold for the first year or two which really helped me to get better coping mechanisms in place before I put myself in potentially stressful situations. 

If it’s more of a mental-health related relapse, definitely try not to put too much pressure on yourself! It’s okay to just look something over briefly and then put it down and walk away for a big. Try to reframe studying from this daunting thing looming over you, to something you have a choice over! It’s okay to not study, but just keep in mind not studying could ultimately make you feel worse than you’re already feeling.

KindVoice,fdpo1n3,t3_eme800,1578634243.0,"27 F- Ok so I come from a dysfunctional household where the same thing happened to me. In my case, my mother is an addict. She attacked me, I ended up being the one arrested. I was lucky in that once she sobered up a few days later, she dropped the charges. I was never held in jail though...

As someone who has been through the chaos of growing up in a dysfunctional environment with not enough love to go around: I think it’s really awesome that you want to be there for her. Having someone to rely on and trust is rare for people who come from dysfunctional families. 

That being said, be careful. Life isn’t a fairy tale. I was a fucked up person as a result of the abuse. It took years of therapy to not lash out the way it was exemplified to me as a child. We model what we see. You seem kind and genuine. Just remember to take care if yourself I general, but especially while this is unfolding. Try to come to terms with the fact that right now it doesn’t seem like there’s much to be done.  Do whatever you can to minimize your anxiety. 

Obviously the most important thing for your girlfriend is a lawyer. I had a separate legal case against my parents as an adult, and I paid more money than I could afford to a good lawyer and won. It’s honestly worth going into debt over if her parents are as awful as they sound. Just advice from personal experience.

Once she’s out of jail, definitely find some local women’s shelters. They will have the resources she needs to get on her feet again. I would also suggest a counselor. There are state run programs in most places that offer things like this.

Best of luck to you both !"

GenderCritical,fcmduud,t3_ehul1t,1577771720.0,"From a psychological perspective: probably because it fits the narrative of what women in our society are: helpless. If a transwoman is murdered or endangered/ harmed in some way, we can sympathize as a society and say “poor thing” easier than we could if it were a male victim over the age of 18. Men are meant to be able to hold their own. In our society, it’s shameful enough to be gay (aka the ultimate sissy). To be a victim of a crime is almost met with a “served ya right” mentality. 

As far as women of color go: it’s astounding how real the concept of “the less dead” is. Unfortunately our society values whites women above women of color. Women of color rarely get the justice the deserve.

As far as male perpetrators goes: I think there’s no mainstream outcry against it because it would spotlight the power dynamics of systemic sexism, much like the #metoo movement has been doing. It would also call into question the integrity of men as a whole, as our leaders and society makers, and shed light on some of the animalistic behaviors that all men inherently possess. It would threaten their place in society because it would highlight the worse of what “manhood” is and is capable of being.

I think the best way to combat this is by giving compliments to other women you deem prettier than yourself. Genuine ones. Find a thing that you think is gorgeous about the other girl and point it out! Nine times out of ten the girl will be so happy for the compliment that their happiness will be contagious. It’s like conditioning yourself. You’re replacing your negative emotions with something outwardly positive. Plus, honestly- everyone is an insecure mess. Sometimes a compliment from a fellow woman makes a HUGE difference in a persons day. 

Losing potential friendships because of your own insecurity is such a life. You’re better than that! If you weren’t you wouldn’t be looking for help conquering it :) 

We all get like this sometimes, but try and remember: everyone hates themselves at least a little. Ignoring a beautiful person because they’re beautiful is just as fucked up as ignoring an ugly person for being ugly."

I can’t tell you how big of a difference medication can make. I’ve also been in therapy for basically forever and it’s truly life changing! 

Medication and treatment aside, if you want to reframe the thought patterns you’re having let me just say that I have been to some of the darkest places a person can be with depression, and having survived it, my happy moments in life (of which there are SOSO many) are so much more beautiful. I have a profound gratitude for each moment that I don’t think people without mental illness could ever really understand. 

So sure, it sucks to be different and not have happiness come as easily; but it’s honestly a blessing in disguise. You can’t have light without dark! And because my dark is darker than most, I think my light is brighter than most :)

AmItheAsshole,f35hwqd,t3_dfp1yq,1570678221.0,"Sorry, OP. Although I hear where you’re coming from and more notice would have made a huge difference, YTA. Your sister is clearly struggling, knew she needed immediate inpatient attention (which btw basically means she’s either suicidal, homicidal, or delusional) and the one person who she trusted with her child handed that child over to strangers. I hear what people are saying about CPS having a bad rep and offering services etc, but the truth is that your nephew will be in foster care and it might take her months after release from the hospital to get her child back or even see her child again. CPS workers are vastly underpaid, overworked, and are not as compassionate as one would hope. Your sister likely would have had CPS involved once she got to the hospital anyway, because she would tell them all about her life in an attempt to get better and they would offer their assistance, but the major difference is: the child would be in her custody, not the states. Once a child is in state custody, it is very difficult to get the child back. She clearly loves her child if she is seeking help. I can’t imagine how devastated she will be when she is out of the psych ward..."

For me it’s my favorite bath bomb, a face mask, some charcoal toothpaste, a good podcast and picking out an outfit for the next day that will make me feel gorgeous (while still being comfortable). These are those little things that we completely forget about when we’re depressed- but basically just showing yourself compassion and treating you how you would treat your child or best friend or whatever. Take you time, whatever that means for you!"
KindVoice,f2ol3ns,t3_ddto07,1570329879.0,"Hi! You’re awesome!!! You have so many hobbies and skills and interests and I truly think that’s admirable!! Try not to feel so pressured by society. We all do things and find things at our own pace. 

If you want to try to test the waters, I’d suggest trying some dating apps. You likely won’t find love but it will put you in the dating scene and make you feel more comfortable with the typical ‘mating rituals’ of modern dating. Plus, a lot of these apps are specifically for hookups (idk if you’re into kissing a rando or not, but if so this is an easy fix to get it over with!) 

Keep your head up man, you’re doing great!"

When I’m depressed I’ve gotten in the habit of allowing myself to feel the shittiness in full, validating that it’s OK to feel that way, but also showing myself compassion & love. Just remember that it won’t last forever! It may *feel* like it’s going to last forever, but I promise it won’t. You’ve got this, man! You’re stronger than what you’re facing :)"

Men are historically more violent and oppressive, but that doesn’t mean women aren’t also violent and oppressive. Women are sexually violent. I just don’t think it’s fair to call rape a “male issue”. Women are rapists too. Period. We’re not exempt because we have vaginas. Is it more commonly a male problem? Sure- but let’s leave some space for the victims of female rapists to feel validated."

Men underreport rape. Boys underreport rape. And this is doubly true if the rape is done by a woman.  We don’t live in a vacuum. Men are not the only ones capable of rape or violence. Feminism is supposed to be about equality? Let’s get our facts straight and not attack an entire gender when women are just as capable as being horrible people as men."

Your dick size really isn’t the end all be all. I promise. As long as you can make a girl cum it truly doesn’t matter in the least. Make yourself a fucking legend at eating out and fingering and bam you’re golden. 

Keep your head high, this bullshit will pass. Your friends clearly suck as human beings so it’s time to move on and find a different crowd. Be grateful you found out now and not when something tragic happened and you really needed the support. 

People who ostracize others for their bodies are actual garbage."

His work is so deliberate, has a sense of motion, passion, purpose, and is honestly such a joy for me to admire. Seeing this particular work in person brought me to tears for two reasons: 
1) it’s more beautiful than I ever imagined in person- seeing every brush stroke was surreal.
2) this man literally sacrificed his mind for his work. Mixing paints cost him his sanity, and there he was in an institution seeing and manifesting beauty that I got to enjoy generations later and he never saw a dime for his talent. I felt like I was with him for a moment and was overcome with gratitude, grief, joy, inspiration, marvel, and I totally lost it."

mentalhealth,f1gja9d,t3_d995sc,1569468520.0,"first of all: I’m so happy for you!! It takes a combination of guts and humility to acknowledge that what you’re experiencing is nothing to be ashamed of and that you are worthy enough of self care to go out and seek professional help. So many people are too ashamed of misinformed or think too little of themselves to do this and it is legitimately a MASSIVE accomplishment to take that step so you should be so proud of yourself. 

On mindfulness: it’s obviously borrowed from Buddhism, and although I was aware of the concept prior to treatment, the revelation that I could use it as a tool for my mental health was astounding to me. What your therapist is teaching you is CBD- so great job on picking a therapist also! I found out about CBD (cognitive behavioral therapy) when I was in an outpatient mental health program about 9 years ago and it honestly changed my life. It’s so so easy to get caught in a negative cycle with anxiety, but just taking a minute and remembering to breath and take inventory of where you are, what you’re doing, what you’re feeling and try to be more present in THIS moment is that the most useful tool I’ve ever had. When I get really caught up in anxiety, depression, obsessive thoughts etc. I do a trick one of my councilors taught me which is: going through as many of the senses as you can in that moment ie: 3 things I hear, 3 things I feel, 3 things I see, etc. and reminding yourself that you are here right now and nowhere else- the past is gone, the future is far away and right now is where you are and you should be present for it! 

The hardest part for me was not judging myself when I caught myself in negative patterns or behaviors. My therapist always says “treat yourself with kindness” and there’s this meme I’ve seen that talks about taking to yourself how you’d speak to your best friend, so rather than being judgemental of myself when I’m cycling into depression and anxiety, I have been working on allowing myself to feel what I feel, tell myself that it will pass and that I am okay and this doesn’t mean I’m “failing” at being healthy, and then practice some grounding techniques. 

You’re doing great and again congratulations on starting therapy!!"

-Getting over the idea that I NEEDED it in order to cope with life
-Learning healthier ways to cope with life
-and then maintaining the desire to continue living healthier. That’s really the hardest once, I guess. 

I don’t have “cravings” necessarily, because drugs ruined my life. But I definitely have moments where I think “fuck...it’d be so good to escape this feeling with drugs rn”. It’s not always about the drug itself, but it’s always always about the desire to escape."

creepyencounters,f0yzc5i,t3_d75vnv,1569082480.0,"This sounds a lot like what Noreen Gosch preaches about her son, Johnny Gosch. If you’re not familiar: Johnny was abducted and never found. Police refused to believe Johnny was abducted and insisted he was a run away/ really avoided getting involved at all. Noreen was HUGE on changing a ton of laws in missing children’s cases. She has always maintained that Johnny was scouted and then abducted to be sold into a child sex ring for the elite. A lot of people think that the loss of her son caused her to spout this wild theory, while others give it credence. She describes encounters where men would take pictures of Johnny from their vehicles and then drive off prior to his abduction.

Given the whole Epstein thing, I think the notion of elite pedophiles is in the forefront of people’s minds (at least for now, anyway- I’m sure it will fade into obscurity eventually as all these things do). It really makes you wonder though...how ‘crazy’ is Noreen Gosch?

Regardless, you definitely dodged a bullet OP. At least you got away, even if your picture is in the hands of some creeps. Smart thinking on your part!!"

mentalhealth,f081zx8,t3_d43dwd,1568473601.0,"Hi! I think this is the most common feeling with depression (at least for me). I’ve learned that when I feel this way, I typically have been neglecting myself. Life can feel especially shitty when you are just going through the motions: ie, going to the job you hate, coming home and eating whatever, staying up late to do nothing in particular (like browse the internet) because there’s a need to escape reality. The best thing for me to do when I’m feeling like this is refocus myself on things that make me feel good! For example, I like baths and suspense novels- so I will go out and buy myself a bath bomb, a new book, and if I really need a treat- a new pair of super comfy sweatpants. Treating yourself like you matter is so super important and I think sometimes we completely forget to give ourselves the things we deserve- the little pleasures in life! Something as small as wearing clothes you feel most yourself in can really help. Taking the time to check in with yourself and what you can do to improve your routine can be huge for how you feel. I hope this helps!! Just know we’ve all been there and most of us will be there again soon lol but there are things you can do to help yourself out of it :)"

AmItheAsshole,ezy0s1o,t3_d2uish,1568254621.0,"NAHH-As a woman, I think my primary concern would be: did he say this to me before he said it to the world? Unlike other people on the thread, I think this is more about the intimacy of it all first and foremost. This seems like the kind of conversation you should have had with your wife before posting a memorializing public post. I think if you talked through the desire to honor her, what your thoughts about death and tragedy were, etc she probably would have felt more secure in her relationship with you. It’s probably not a jealousy thing so much as a betrayal thing. I think being open and honest with her about what your intentions were before doing this would have prevented her from feeling slighted."
