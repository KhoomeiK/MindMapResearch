dating_advice,foyai0l,t3_ga3kux,1588168861.0,"Yeah, that's another hurdle in dating you have to cross over if you're depressed. If you feel like nothing in life matters, you stop having passions, you stop caring. You don't have to impress your partner anymore so you stop trying. Then you go about life, and instead of talking it out with your partner you both just carry on and pretend that nothing's happening because that's easier.

Have you talked to them about it ? If he doesn't want to put in any effort even after you talking with him and telling him then both of you don't seem to be compatible. Of course, not everything is clear cut. If you like other parts of him but not that he isn't passionate then focus on those parts of him. No one's perfect"
