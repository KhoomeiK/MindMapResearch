Anxiety,fcvo9yn,t3_ej29di,1578006402.0,"I just wanted to drop in and let you know you're not alone. I remember I felt \*exactly\* the same in my early 20s when I sort of fell into the adult working world and wondered, ""Is this what it's like all my life? Because I'm sick of it already.""

I can't say exactly what your path will look like or give you any magic bullet advice, I can just say over the years I've had jobs I hated and jobs I liked. I've never really felt \*passionate\* about a job the way some people talk about, but I've gotten way more accepting of the fact that that isn't just the way I'm wired. But at age 40 I'm in a situation where I feel good about my job, have arranged me life so I don't have to work 40 hour weeks anymore, and can honestly say though it may not look like much I'm living my best life.

I feel like overall my early 20s were the hardest part of it all, though obviously mileage may vary. Hang in there! Don't give up on arranging the life you want, even if you have to do it in small increments. And try not to make yourself upset comparing yourself to others."
