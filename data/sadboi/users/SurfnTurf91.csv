We had a famous actor attempt to build a massive home in our small beach community but because it would greatly increase the surrounding rental prices that mostly service industry workers lived at they denied the zoning and construction of the home. Well they petitioned the town hall and then they subsequently denied it. 10000 sq foot homes are never ok just like being a billionaire is NOT ok!

Ah okay so technically you are right but most of these communistic societies today lean to the nationalization side. Did not know that though, thanks.
