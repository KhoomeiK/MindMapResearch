She wanted a ""real American"" experience. By my senior year I think we finally had a cheerleading team, but there was no coach and only 3 or 4 students. They weren't allowed to do jumps or lifts, so they pretty much just stood on the sidelines, waved their pompoms, and shouted some cheers. I only ever saw them once, at a basketball game. 

Also, our football team was the laughing stock of the school because the team was terrible. Ultimate frisbee were the popular kids.

For reference, I was not coordinated enough to play any of those sports so I ran cross country and track."

And as to pulling out, also just messy and sticky and can be hard to clean even if I’m not worried about the mattress itself. I’m not saying what she’s asking of you is reasonable, but I am similarly “phobic” from time to time and if I don’t want to deal with the mess after my partner is completely fine with me asking him to put a condom on.

BipolarReddit,fn3ly6b,t3_fz608f,1586623383.0,"I’m so sorry you’re going through all of that, and want to tell you that you can talk to me if that would help at all. I don’t currently have Reddit notifications on but I can turn them on if talking to someone will help you. Just send me a message. For reference, I am 26F and was diagnosed at age 20. 

Regarding some advice, I was to first say that while I have not been exactly in your shoes, I have had many, many episodes of suicidal ideation and obsessing over plans. I felt that way just two weeks ago (for the umpteenth time), and I’m so much better today.

For your specific situation, here are the things I would encourage:

1. Look for a therapist anywhere in the US that might take your insurance. If it’s a local company that might be hard, but even then there are probably in-network providers that you wouldn’t drive to but can still see now because pretty much all mental health providers in the country are doing some degree of, it not 100%, telehealth. And many are looking for new clients because with the economic downturn + telehealth complications, they are losing clients. If you’re comfortable telling me your insurance company name I can even help you with this, because I know it’s overwhelming to navigate. 

2. Find a psychiatrist. A good therapist should help you feel heard and less alone, and also give you a healthier conversation than your friend is currently capable of, but without meds it will be so hard if not impossible to actually feel happy again. Even if you are already on medication, these are unprecedented times so it’s very possible for previously effective medication regimens to no longer work. That happened to me, and now I’m trying new stuff. It’s not perfect but it’s a work in progress. It’ll be worth it when I get the right medication/dosage.

3. Please take a break from this friend. I know you love her, but the relationship you have with her right now is unfortunately very toxic for both of you. It’s clearly not helping you, and I’m sure it’s not helping her either to be essentially relying on a friend for mental health care, especially a friend who is in such a hard place right now. Additionally, the things she has said to you demonstrate profound ignorance and lack of understanding of the reality of the disorder. This is not her fault, in my opinion. I’ve heard many depressed people say things about wishing they had mania, and honestly I get it. If I’m just hypomanic, it’s great until it’s not, at least for me. She also might be really relieved to have a diagnosis, which is also understandable. Having a diagnosis, even if it’s a hard one, is better than being lost in the dark. However, she does not seem to be considering the downsides, and she probably just doesn’t understand yet. This isn’t her fault, but it is very damaging for you. If she is really your friend, she will come around to understanding if you tell her you need to be left alone for a while. 


4. Get in touch with someone who cares about you besides this friend. You have us here regardless, but if there is someone in your life who already knows you (parent, sibling, cousin, old friend, even an acquaintance who you trust but aren’t necessarily super close with), they can help in a different way than anyone on the internet. And they care about you. If you don’t want to talk to anyone about this, that is also understandable. But I didn’t want to leave that point out because having a support system is a vital part of managing this condition, at least from my experience and understanding. 


Hang in there. It will all be okay in the end, and if it’s not okay now then it’s not the end."

But my surgeon said with how visibly inflamed the nerve was when they actually got in there, that it was pretty much expected for it to take some time to calm down. It’s starting to get a bit better, to the point that the incision site is more painful than my leg.

My friend was raised by a single mom. Her mom got pregnant by accident and decided to keep her, and told the dad he could be involved or not but she was having the baby. He panicked and ran away and my friend didn’t know her dad at all. When she was a teenager, I think 14 or 15, one of her dad’s family members died and her mom decided to take her to the funeral because she felt like it was the right thing. I don’t think my friend wanted to go, but long story short she went and now, at age 20 something, has a relationship with her dad. She sees him from time to time, and he is good to her. 

There’s obviously a lot there, but her dad changed. People do. However, your ex sounds threatening and self-serving, so I would proceed with a lot of caution. Maybe wait until your child is older and see if she wants to meet him? Getting the courts involved isn’t a bad idea, but definitely trust your intuition. You know better than anyone whether this man should have any role in your child’s life or not."

I don’t know if this is any help, but my mom’s parents were both cremated when they died, and we waited until after they both passed to bury their ashes together in their home country. The burial was 8 years after my grandmother passed, and 6 months after my grandfather. We had a memorial service shortly after, but then the ashes sat in an urn in my aunt’s house (I think?) until the whole family could gather. It was a very delayed ceremony, but it finally felt like a real funeral. We cried, we laughed, we hugged, and we celebrated my grandparents. I met family members I had never met before, and in the end it didn’t matter how long it had been since their deaths. 

I know it is going to be so hard not to have a real funeral right now, but I wanted to share my experience in case it gives you any comfort that saying goodbye can still be real and meaningful even if it’s months or years later.

They won’t evaluate you for financial aid if they haven’t accepted you, but if you’re waiting on an acceptance or were waitlisted then getting FAFSA in ahead of time can help you get your award faster. But really you don’t have to do it until after acceptance."
medschool,fj2xlr0,t1_fj2qzm2,1582957753.0,"I use the Complete Anatomy app and it’s quite helpful, although my school paid for it so I’m not sure how much it costs. Does your school have a prosection with labeled structures? The 3D learning in prosection was the most helpful thing for me!"
ChronicPain,fhqsm4c,t3_f4gve6,1581810510.0,"I know the feeling. Chronic pain isn’t just pain. It’s a whole mess of a situation that affects every facet of someone’s life, and I am all too familiar with that. Feel free to DM me if you want to talk."
me_irl,fhd6lxf,t3_f2ek5e,1581478435.0,When I was 8 I used to bring my older brother’s toys to school and sell them to boys in my class. He never noticed and when I finally told him about 15 years later he was pissed.

tifu,fh71pg8,t1_fh5djet,1581312138.0,So true. Every time I bring it up I regret doing so and swear to never mention it again.
AskMen,fgyewav,t1_fgyem6i,1581182637.0,"A foot in a year is a LOT holy shit. How tall are you now?

medschool,fgp1cfq,t3_ezhz8m,1580994049.0,"I felt that way until very recently, when I started spending just a small amount of time doing things I actually enjoy. It makes a huge difference and makes it feel worth it. I’m not doing a lot - just volunteering once a week and doing a bit more shadowing. But it makes me happier and brings it all back to helping humans."
