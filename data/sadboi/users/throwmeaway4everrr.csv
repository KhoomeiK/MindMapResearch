Exfoliating before shaving and using moisturizing shave cream might help too. For the ingrown hairs, a warm compress can help open up the follicle so you can pull the hair out if it's not too irritating."

Warning: contains some talk of menstruation!


I went to the gym bright and early this morning and I used the bathroom when I got there and I realized I didn't bring an extra tampon. I went pee and left in the tampon I had put in this morning. I did 20 minutes on the stair climber and then some dumbbell shoulder presses and rows, assisted pull ups, and a core routine. When I went to the bathroom after my workout, I realized that my tampon was gone. I was wearing underwear and yoga pants, so I don't know how I could have lost it, but it was gone!


I worked out really hard, but not so strenuously that I would ever imagine something like this happening. Assisted pull ups are really hard for me, so maybe it could have happened then? How would I not notice? How would it fall out and out of my underwear and all the way out of my pants? I obviously couldn't go look around the weights area for fear that someone might see and know it was mine. I am MORTIFIED. What if someone saw? Can I ever go back? Should I just die? I usually work out in the evenings, so maybe if I never go in the morning again then I'll never see these morning lifters again? Of course this would happen the FIRST TIME I ever work up the courage to use the men's weights area.


I guess there is a chance it fell out when I went to the bathroom when I first arrived, but I usually notice. Please someone tell me it's happened before or that it probably didn't really happen or that it's going to be okay, because at this point I just want to die.


TLDR: I think my tampon fell out at the gym this morning. Can I ever go back?
