It's not drawn out over tons of episodes like S-Town, but the stories are pretty unforgettable. If you want something a bit more tech related there is a podcast called Darknet Diaries. It's all about cyber crime and the underbelly of the internet. Listen to episode 6 titled [The Beirut Bank Job](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/6/). It'll blow you mind. [Ear Hustle](https://www.earhustlesq.com/) is another good one all about life in the prison system.  
  
Ill give you two more but these aren't super related to crime or crazy people directly but I think you'd really like. The first one is gonna sound crazy but trust me, it's really good. [Dolly Partons America.](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/dolly-partons-america) It's hosted by one of the guys who do the Radiolab podcast. It's way more than just a look at Dolly's music career. It explores some really interesting subjects. The last one is one of my all time favorite podcasts and it does fit in with the criminal/crazy theme, [The Church Of What's Happening Now With Joey Coco Diaz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCsdBNTBvVA). This guy is not only hilarious, but he's been through some shit. On his own very early in childhood, was a coke addict, kidnapped a guy, been in prison, was a thief, worked his way into comedy, and is one of the most hardcore but sweet guys I have ever heard. The stories he tells are insane and fascinating."

The lead vocalist has an amazing unique voice that I can only describe as sounding like Tom Waits swallowed a pissed of cat and it got stuck in his throat. If you don't know who that is what I am trying to say is it's gravely, high pitched and snarly, but oddly beautiful. Fantastic guitar work too."
Michigan,fr2zifj,t1_fr2s20n,1589846927.0,"It happens man! I've seen some of the most level headed people I know do/say some crazy stuff the last few months. You also might be 100% right. It's hard to tell these days. I was ranting to my friends the other day and my buddy pointed something out to me, and it really made sense of all the craziness online. He said, right now everyone has a ton of free time on their hands, can't really go anywhere, are freaked out and need to vent. There is a lot of unknowns right now and we don't deal with that well. Mix all that together and [""baby, you got a stew going.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr2PlqXw03Y). A really shitty stew. I tend to save my angry call outs for people who really REALLY deserve it, and even then I sometimes come back and apologize and we end up having a really rational discussion.    
  
I'm not trying to shame you or anything, I get it. I just see my own actions in your comment and thought I'd do a sort of pay it forward type of thing. I hope you and the person you responded to stay safe make wise well thought out choices, and we all get back to some sort of normal soon."

Looking into their comment history it seems that it might be someone who wants to use it as a way to ""shove it in peoples faces"" which if that's the case then they are a pretty shitty person, but it might also be someone who really wants to take a look back themselves and be able to see the data without a ""doomer"" or ""reckless"" slant.

It didn't really do anything but come off as hostile and honestly there is plenty of that out there right now. People are freaked out and there are a lot of reasons they should be, and I'm not talking about only virus related stuff. Our government is fucked and clearly no where near prepared, our economy is super broken, people are at each other throats...this place hasn't been America for a while. I think we would be in agreement there. This circles back to my original, but harsh, point. Let's take this opportunity to get to fix shit. Never in our lifetime has there been a better time to come to get her and try to make some changes. Even if it's small steps, even if we all have to bend and get uncomfortable for a bit. No one wants people to die, No one wants to take away your rights. People are concerned for public health...that is not a bad thing. People are concerned about freedoms and making money...that is not a bad thing. So if we're all fighting for good things why are we fighting each other and not working on making changes?"
southafrica,fqy1ve2,t3_glcx6w,1589741238.0,"I feel ya partner. From the US. My personality have always been pretty laid back. I have been talking with by buddies online for the past few weeks while we have been off of work. A majority of discussion has been covid and the events surrounding it. Like many we vent about things we see and hear. One of my friends called me out in a really surprising way a week ago. I was venting and upset and he first pointed out that I am always the gentle mild mannered caring one of the group and he noticed that I was reacting in anger a lot more than normal. He said that was more his role in our group and asked if I was alright. It's nice to have friends who care like that, but it did really make me see that I was getting too deep in the waters. The main point is what he said next and it really rings true. He said that there are A LOT of people with extra time on their hands right now to spout nonsense and the media is eating this pandemic up like hungry hungry hippos. It sucks and it's sad to think about but take this into consideration. Media loves controversy. Social media does not dictate how the population feels. In the US it's RAMPANT right now because we are also in an election year. Not to mention all the bots and fake accounts. Shit if I was nefarious and wanted to spread disinformation this time right now is prime to do so.

I'm just trying to make people realize that if this 1-uping culture continues we are going to fall farther and farther into a broken country.

The interview with Fauci where he said masks were not suggested took place on March 8 on a CBS interview with Jonathan Lapook. Fauci did say masks did not seem to help in reducing the virus and did not suggest them. As of March 8 we were not even close to being in the middle of the pandemic. As of March 8 the US had just hit 500 cases and 22 deaths, again no where near the middle of a pandemic. I should also point out that about April 3 the CDC first started suggesting the use of facemasks. If you want sources you can Google the information it's well documented.

“Drag that tyrant RealScottAdsit's out to the front lawn. Fit him/her/them for a noose,” to which a user responded, “Either President Trump sends in the troops or there is going to be a midnight lynching in at RealScottAdsit's house soon.”

You won't become prospers at all if people keep getting too sick to go to work. Do you really think a lot of people are going to be willing to go to work when a member or two of their staff has the virus and faces getting it them selves or spreading it to their loved ones? This is why we open SLOWLY. People are acting like this has been going on for a year. It's been less than a few months. If a business and or civilians can't pause for a few months without facing financial ruin then that infrastructure is SEVERELY broken. Not due to their negligence but due to deeper issues that have been ignored for way too long. I could easily turn the whole ""well you should have saved money in case of a crisis"" right back on to these businesses the same way they so arrogantly told others to do that. Welcome to my shoes. These people just want to go back to the way it was but are not realizing or willing to accept that the way it was is really messed up.

Instead of just reopening he should be hounding his government leaders about what the duck they doing to to ensure he can reopen or more importantly what they are doing to protect people from this.

I'll be up front with you it's a self-help type of book, something I would never read until I read this book. I'll be up front with you at first it seems a bit hippy dippy sounding, but it has some really interesting points about how our minds work and how to change negative thinking patterns.

If you back track Easter was just over 3 weeks ago. Yesterday was the exactly 3 weeks since the first protest that took place in Michigan which set off tons of protests around the country. We know for a fact that a lot of those protesters were not employed and that they were from various cities in the state. I don't know if NYC had protests like other states though. How many of the protesters are going to admit that they were out? How many of them would consider themselves as ""staying home""?  How many people saw those protests on TV and we're not happy with being home but sheltering in place and decided ""Fuck it""? It is quite possible  that a lot of cases if traced might lead directly to or be residuals from the protests. Of course there are going to be other factors that will play along side of that.

[
The Dismemberment Plan - Crush](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yw8WMhUzjew)  
It's a cover of a late 90's pop song. The song is about being in denial about having deeper feelings for their crush. The original is upbeat and poppy like you would expect from a 90's R&B song, the the cover turns it into something much more sinister and creepy.  
  
[She Wants Revenge - Tear You Apart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzgTnK3agPM)   
I am not sure if this song is about animistic lust or hatred. Probably both.  
  
[Blue October - The End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2A5OCSMvrw)  
This is the darkest creepiest song I have ever heard. Basically a guy watches his ex and breaks into her house.  
  
[Bauhaus - Crowds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVDdm3GvdUk)  
Super simple discordant piano with subtle guitar and and singing that feels like taking an emotional dump. Make sure to read the lyrics for this one, so venomous!  
  
[Ween - Buenas Tardes Amigo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uv-gT9lNa1g)

Michigan,fpm3f05,t3_ge6ak9,1588724759.0," Here is my thinking on this. What do YOU have to be embarrassed about? Were you one of those LARPing bullies who were there? Was there anything you could do in that moment to stop them and change their mind? Probably not. So what do YOU have to be embarrassed about? You are from a state that has a pretty badass Governor who actually seems to give a fuck about the people that live in her state. So much so that she's not afraid to speak up when needed. All the stuff on TV where they make fun of Michigan, you need to look at that as they are not poking fun at you, they are poking fun at those protesters. And rightly so! They are not laughing at us, they are laughing with us....laughing at the protesters. I'm proud of where I am from and I'll be damned if I am going to let some cosplayers mess with my head like that."

I am betting it will continue to rise, but the simple fact is that no one knows. All were doing right now is trying to predict the future on the small and crappy amount of data we have. To me the 2-3 week method just makes sense. Want an accurate idea if where we are currently and where we might be...2-3 weeks back. It just makes logical sense.

The TV show is a mix of wacky/goofy/weird comedy with some hilarious interviews. The podcast is more interview improv where a guest usually plays the straight man (serious/normal person in the conversation) and other guests play quirky characters. Been listening to thepodcast for YEARS and it never let me down.  Both Schwartz and Middleditch are frequent guests and also are some of the best episodes. Pro tip: Throw the podcasts on while doing dishes or another boring task.

Since you like all these rappers and a lot of rappers use samples from old school songs check out [Whosampled.com](https://www.whosampled.com/) to connect to older songs you will recognize but probably don't know. It will lead you down a rabbit hole of music for sure.  
  
My suggestions would be the following:  
The Talking Heads (funky, awesome percussion, neat background vocals. Remain in light is a good album to start with.)  
You might dig bands like The Black Keys, Clutch or The Shouting Matches. They have a very heavy blues rock influence but make some killer songs to keep you moving.    
Tame Impala is a good suggestion too. Trippy, lots of electronic elements mixed with rock."

We are so busy fighting we are missing the opportunity to come together and fix what is broken. Complacency and denial are why we are stuck in this cycle. The further we wade into the waters the harder it is to get back to shore without a panicked and violent struggle. It's like a lot of us know things are bad and we try to fix it in ways that worked before but we aren't being taken seriously. We should be grouping together to work towards making our voices heard by our government. The question is ""How?"" Like you I am not sure how to do that short of a revolution, but that thought is terrifying. I don't want to see violence or blood, but if it means a positive change and a better future I will fight if I have to. I am going to do everything in my power to avoid that but before anything like that happens we need to come together...at least stop with this school yard bullying bullshit that's being pushed as a ""good thing"".

I do understand there are asshats out there who use depression as a crutch to get attention but often times it's not because they are ""just fishing for a compliment"" The point is this person stated they were having a tough time dealing with some aspects of life and hindering their creativity (which can be a big time release of that depression for people) and you come along and just tell them they are fishing for compliments. On top of that what if they are? What if they need a pick me up and no one in their circle is listening or providing that help for them? Or perhaps this person finally made a breakthrough in their current state and is happy they were able to pull themselves out of it and decided to share in their victory and now you're comment is shitting on that. I made my comment because there is a huge misconception that depressed people are just attention seekers. Go take a look at r/anxiety and read some of the posts.
