Gifted,fqahv2h,t3_ghkdgu,1589219333.0,I think the ways we put stock in 'intelligence' (at least in the US) is often a detriment. Intelligence does not simply mean one thing & often institutions forget this. People who are perceived as intelligent or 'school smart' aren't always wise. They are not always emotionally intelligent & I think this is something we look over.
Gifted,fqahmjq,t3_ghofqw,1589219220.0,Being smart & enjoying participating in class certainly earned me no points with my peers until I reached College.
