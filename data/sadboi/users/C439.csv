relationship_advice,fpnc6ib,t1_fpnb893,1588757705.0,"Thanks for answering, this so far has been the most informative. Yeah I was even with a girl in 2006 that had an abnormal Pap smear and I didn‚Äôt knew what that meant back then. I was with other girls years later and were all negative. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I had it back then as a male silent carrier and it cleared by the tine I met her in 2012 or so. It all dawned on me when she told me, so I didn‚Äôt make much a fuss. She was always tested negative our entire 7 years together. She was scared I literally would leave the bar in an Uber, after I got up and had to use the bathroom after she told me. But of course I didn‚Äôt 

But what you are saying is correct. My view on her has changed from the rose colored glasses. I was a 28 male and she was 22 at the time. Now she is 30 and I‚Äôm 37, so it‚Äôs come a long way in those 7 years. Just never thought she be like the way she is now. But I get people change and with new environments will act differently. We always prided ourselves in a couple that was immune to all that drama. But now it‚Äôs like meeting a new person that was once perfect in my mind and now has mental health and flaws starting to show. I won‚Äôt lie I‚Äôm a decent looking guy, but was kinda a shit show when she met me as far as my life, job and drug issues. Over time she helped me to be a better me and I thought I really knew her. But as time passed through separation, I started seeing the real her and also the real me. I noticed my faults, but also a lot of things I was blamed or felt bad about that were not my fault."
relationship_advice,fpnbgn8,t1_fpnb75y,1588756960.0,"Not mad at all! Probably comes off that way, because being together 7 years you think of the future. And me as the man at 37 was not making but 13hr and living in a small town. She had big city dreams and made it happen. It seem she thought I couldn‚Äôt do it, but I did. So yeah those things do figure in when you‚Äôre getting serious and thinking of kids, marriage and all that. It seem to be something she looked at as far as moving things a step further. Personally I didn‚Äôt make much a fuss and believed I get there eventually"
relationship_advice,fpnb9en,t1_fpnavtk,1588756756.0,"I get you. Yeah if I got back with her, I‚Äôd probably have to consider a vaccine shot that covers most strands but not all and wait for her to show clear on a Pap. Even then I would have to presume I have it from probability if I slept with her regularly. Condoms don‚Äôt do much to protect from it like other things. So if it worked out no issue really...but if it didn‚Äôt work out I have to tell every other girl I try to date I have it. Not really trying to add that on things to tell a new partner. So it‚Äôs kind of a big deal as far as other girls and stigma. If we got married or were really together it wouldn‚Äôt really matter. Her sister has it and is in a great relationship and her mom even had it at some point. It‚Äôs that common most don‚Äôt even know they picked it up till they are in their 40s and it comes back from suppression. I hear yah, it‚Äôs 4am here and I‚Äôm getting tired as well lol"

However they can be silent carriers to women. It shows no signs most the time and causes a cellular structure change that could possibly lead to cancer 20-30 years out for some if not regularly checked. HIV is something entirely more deadly and different. HPV is so common it‚Äôs estimated 70% of sexually active people will get it without knowing, and possibly clear/suppress it in 18 months without knowing.

Bestbuy,fhrc7v2,t3_f44mhw,1581822606.0,"We had a lot of students post Apple that were part time leave tbh. It wasn‚Äôt worth the 12ish dollars for them. Issue was it was very stressful, but staffed so tight no room for call outs. So when people do, you constantly being called to come in. It‚Äôs kinda like customer service customers that are already upset, but with a reservation line clients will get upset about because Apple is taking too long or it‚Äôs just chaotic. 

 I was a cia and FT ARA for 6 years. My entire team has left between October last year and my manager left today. We were all there for 6/8 years, and some 2 years. The turn around has become crazy. But yeah a lot of CAs would study in the back during dead nights. However a lot of CAs ended up working closer to 30ish hrs a week due to high turn over from CAs getting burnt out, and the time it took to train new people. For even a part timer, it‚Äôs not unheard of to work from Wednesday till Tuesday of the next week. It was ok for those out of school looking to get some resume experience if they didn‚Äôt mind the pay. Most CAs that are still there pretty much just got baked all day, tried to take it easy and take a zen approach to not get stressed out. That was my long term experience. I‚Äôd do part time if it was staffed right, and pay was $15. We had only 6 agents for everything and the highest pay for even most tenor ARA was $13.50. 

Blue shirt role they can find coverage. A short staffed precinct hell will rain down, if a call out or you have something with school come up...because no one can replace you from the vast amount of cross trained blue shirts. Keep that in mind and see what the head count/labor situation is at your store. Is it on the margin line or well staffed? Talk to all current agents and I mean all. Some will have different experiences given tenor and job situation.

However if you work at a store that has lots of labor with 2-3 CAs a day and at least 2 ARAs a day it‚Äôs not too bad, but still stressful. It‚Äôs just at least doable... not being pulled in 20 directions, and called outside of work all the time to come in on off days and nights. Stores vary a lot and some are completely understaffed, I‚Äôd avoid those for reasons mentioned. Also secure your pay! Go on Glassdoor dot com and see the average rate and what the going rate is in your store. Once you get locked in, it‚Äôs hard to make a yearly even if you hit personal goals, unless you‚Äôre at a top store. 30% is all store on the raise evaluation and the rest are arbitrary questions the GM will pick in favor or not."

Playing by myself never happens anymore. I guess it‚Äôs just when I tell my friend I‚Äôll play I go out my way. But for the most part the game is secondary and we end up talking about life issues while playing. I‚Äôll usually have a few beers as well to try and relax. Otherwise, I use to really get into them, but I end up just looking at my phone sitting in bed hours upon hours after getting up now. Then it gets late and repeats the same depression cycle."
BreakUps,ffs1fgk,t3_euvuow,1580170799.0,"Yeah, but on the flip side when a girl starts pursuing me, I sometimes get tired of going out and keeping up constantly. Can be a real drain on personal responsibilities and finances... to make a lot of time for someone you‚Äôre not even sure about. 

But yeah, in a long term relationship it is not uncommon to become complacent and settle down. 

It‚Äôs just you don‚Äôt want to keep the same shitty job, and not work on yourself during that time and it‚Äôs easy to fall into that trap. I‚Äôve been on the end feeling good with my ok job that brought in enough, to have a decent townhome and afford dinners out. But never really thought about the next step sometimes. 

Getting out is good, but man doing the single thing in my 30s, and the balancing act of living my life to make it better, and fit others into it can cost me on sleep and overall well-being. Are you going to say no to a cute girl that‚Äôs chasing you, when you are dead ass tired, don‚Äôt wanna go out and she wants to get drinks? Sometimes even single I have to turn a girl down, so I can keep my self priorities in order towards work and furthering my education while not going broke.

I do miss my old 7 year though. As I have other options, but they don‚Äôt seem like the most stable in comparison. But I guess I‚Äôm moving forward with myself better, and realizing what I like and don‚Äôt like. Some girls I see things in them that I did or use to do, and it‚Äôs a big turn off. So I‚Äôm learning to see from the other side as well."
trashy,ffa9ymz,t3_esdti9,1579730769.0,"That‚Äôs messed up.  But there‚Äôs law and moral basis. You be surprised how many 16 year olds girls with fake IDs, tattoos, look older, and at bars there are. You gotta watch it! I was 23 once over a decade ago, and a 16 year old girl I knew was 6‚Äô1, enrolled in community college, already had sleeve tats, got in any bar. I knew her through playing music, her parents were not around much, and she was mostly left on her own. It made her seem a lot older than she was. I would have never known hadn‚Äôt a friend told me. I did date her 3 years later, when she was legit 19. But had no idea until then, and was surprised. I myself at 16 took the ACT and tested into college and left high school early as well.

But I also knew a guy who was aware a girl was 14 and he was 27. Once everyone found out, we kinda distanced ourself from him. He fled the state, his parents kicked him out the family business, and he made a huge series of bad choices in his life. It all came full circle after awhile. I always thought something was off about that guy. Last I heard he was homeless living in a squat somewhere after drug abuse, law problems and blowing all the opportunities he had."
GeekSquad,ff55j2q,t1_fewm5y4,1579580825.0,"Most you can do is put heat on them. I know I‚Äôll be downvoted, but call corporate, ask the store to file an escalation and give a detractor. 2 or all 3 of those will get something going. Although the detractor(survey) will hit the agents and not the service center...Geeksquad managers and GMs tend to freak out about it, along with corporate on them. They just want to get rid of the situation ASAP. Svc center everyone hates and they half ass the job a lot. Any agent in the store would never do that, and would do anything to make your experience a good one(so the detractor is iffy) 

But sometimes the GM who‚Äôs the Geeksquad managers boss, won‚Äôt do much or approve until it gets over them. For something to be done on a store level or a gift card to get a new one. The sticker is normal, but the clasp and off titled fan grinding is unacceptable work. The store needs to be reimbursed by the svc center, or corporate will give the ok the store will do it. Or the GM will just take the hit depending on the price and level of store.

Cosmetic damage and chips are what they are for accidental. If the fan is truly messed up and clasp was broken before(but that‚Äôs gonna be hard to prove) the fan issue is your biggest case to go forward with after all the send backs and that should be the focus of the claim. As that is not cosmetic damage, and a functional piece of the computer that should have been fixed properly."
Bestbuy,fd1pbd8,t3_ej17ip,1578134701.0,"If you put that on your app, you‚Äôre more likely to get the job and then negotiate 2 days for school or something later. I‚Äôve been involved in looking over the interview process, and seen really good candidates passed over, because they didn‚Äôt have open availability for a day or two they needed. Usually job history gaps were judged, and open availability came first and then actual skills/background, when I saw how my store at the time hired over the 6 years there. Catch 22 because sometimes you can be scheduled 10 days in a row with a day off if they start it mid week. I was both part time and full time. However the part timers seem to be able to get a week or so off easier non paid/approved a lot more vs the full timers, usually taking the roles of unofficial lead, for entry level pay barely able to ever get PTO approved. 

Both FT and PT has there perks. For school I much prefer part time for sure. Full time after nearly 6 years was very consuming in and out of work. Def had to have some mental health time forced by my doctor in my later years there, before I moved on from the job.

All that aside funny thing is most our part timers got a lot of hours 8 months out the year that would be almost considered full time. Just depended on time of year, personal sales and also turn over rate, waiting on new hires to get on."
suboxone,fd1gyq7,t1_fd07eh2,1578131253.0,"Yeah if you go that long of a purge for a week, you can either go the next 3 weeks till most subsides...then end up with paws off and on for months. Or get on a very low dose at 0.25mg and likely OP would be ok. I was off 8 months after 11 years. Tapered real fast in 4 months from 5mg-0.25mg. I got through a lot of the worse. But mentally my brain and temperament was almost over the place, caused a lot of personal issues and had bowel issues for many months out. Mental and bowel movement issues stayed with me for close to a year.

I went back on 0.25mg with subutex after being off sub 8 months clean, because it‚Äôs cheaper and easier to gauge. My doctor kept me off the sub program and just does 1 bottle of 30, 2mg pills with 2 refills a normal visit. That‚Äôll last a year for me mostly. 

I worked out those 4 months for my detox during taper after 11 years, and had the perfect detox I thought! But it was all a big lesson! I learned mentally and physically not letting my body get use to a lower milligram longer, was a complete shock.... to just do a 4 month taper after so long. I did stop for 4 days recently to see how it felt. I had w/d and it sucked, but there was no insomnia with the helper med and was easier on me with my current low dose vs my rapid taper last year. I also even skip days here and there. So slow and steady does work out, but most of us want to just hit 0.5 and jump, deal with it. Most make it the first few months, and then after mental depression and ongoing issues of adjusting, end up back on in some way or an antidepressant for years. Or going down a rabbit whole on other meds, to control the damage/repair lingering.

The med really gets in your body with long term use over a year at over 1mg or more with no breaks, taken daily. The body needs time to get all those natural chemicals back even after the withdrawal. I‚Äôm very in favor people holding at 0.25mg for a bit, to let the body adjust and rebuild with lower dosage with a healthy routine vs an instant jump after a week or two. 

Once below 0.5mg the body is starting to realize and healing, then a lot of people jump. I‚Äôve had more success with low dose jumps after a year on while trying to earn my natural chemicals back. Big lesson learned from my 8 months off last year and start of this year. It sucks, but I kind of now have a good understanding of the short term low doses vs trying to taper fast and jump on a higher dose taper. The body will be making up natural chemicals for months or up to 2 years to come, way way after for awhile that will cause random discomfort, and mental stability issues to crop up, till it settles. Low sustain dosing and then going really low is very helpful for the post detox and keeps PAWS away. 

I know this is long, but one thing I never thought of was post detox what would happen? I only thought about the first 30 days and the next month or two after. There‚Äôs a lot more if using long term that I would of prepared for proactively, would I have known. I‚Äôd just like others to have that info from my lessons learned."

I may have stayed at 14hr for part time CA while in school...it‚Äôs def not a bad deal for that.

There‚Äôs nothing like wasting money, and trying to force chemistry that may not be there, then be stuck 35/40 miles from home on a 3 hour date you don‚Äôt want to be on. 

If you‚Äôre looking for a hook up, then way better chances. But sometimes people have luck with a real partner. Just a numbers, trial and error game done on a bigger scale.

I know people out of IT in business and data entry that have tried applying but go nowhere, then went the recruiter route and within a month relocated and were making at least 40k. It‚Äôs surprising and not so surprising, just how much more you can make by leaving Geeksquad.

Basic IT and remote are pretty popular. Usually pays $18-$25 where I‚Äôm at in a poor state. My Geeksquad paid the auto tech just 13.75 as the highest paid member. Not even me the ex full time 5 1/2 ARA made that. Meanwhile the store 18min away had ARAs making 14-17hr.

With PTO when you leave I know it depends on state and sometimes your GM. I didn‚Äôt think I see my PTO money on my way out with a voluntary leave. But either it‚Äôs my states law, or my GM leaving for another job the ASM filed it for me maybe. But it was still nice to get that back. 6 weeks just seem so little if you‚Äôre a FT and most FT usually are ones that have been around 2+ years...not always but most all FT has to put in the time in my area to get it, unless it was an emergency and a job no one wanted. It‚Äôs crazy but my old store hasn‚Äôt shut down, but the turn over rate has been the highest I‚Äôve ever seen. They are just giving out jobs starting at 11.50-12.50 right now, they need people so much.

GeekSquad,fcosf0x,t1_fclz0yk,1577840290.0,"Yeah I left. We started as a one zone CIA when I joined, and transition into a 2 zone within year or so. That was one way they got me on pay. In 2016 I was making more than others there. Then getting my yearly was difficult because depended on the GM with those arbitrary parts that ask:does he unleash the power ect. All subjective questions that don‚Äôt make sense, as I get a good on one that meant the same as the other. The yearly felt very gauged against us, with yes or no answers and no metrics to go on accept all store revenue.

I hit all my metrics before that and would get my yearlys. But they stopped about 2/3 years ago. Always told I need to inspire my team members to do better, and the store didn‚Äôt do good enough...which is 30% of the yearly. All that horse shit 

But I agree I use to work 8-4:30 or so with at least one weekend day off, and one week day off. Once apple came in, and I decided to go back to school..goodbye any family time, or having dinner with my gf at the time. Regardless of pay, before Apple it was an ok enough day, and I didn‚Äôt feel I hated my job at least."

In the end after AASP took place everyone outside the GSM and one guy left, district manger who was a great guy got layed off due to consolidation, half the store left, no GM there anymore after 10 years with the company as of now. There was a lot going on when I left in October. 

I was making 13hr after 5 1/2 years only full time ARA and felt like an assistant manager with my duties and then some, bop labor cut a month after Apple was like come on! We had lots of computers, random Apple reservations holding us up from work, no more morning hours 11-8 now, and was expected to keep a 1-2 day turn time. Was also getting lots of txts calls on my day off. I was going to stay around a bit longer, but at 13hr and my tenor experience we couldn‚Äôt come to an agreement after 6 months post aasp. Probably didn‚Äôt help my GM was on the way out, district was cut and all the other changes. Complete chaos and now I‚Äôm back in school, freelancing my work and looking for a better job. I just held out and tried to work with them as much as possible. Love the people at my store, but hate the way the new reorg payed no attention to anything, but cuts and had the audacity to post all those mental health fliers everywhere.

It was just hard to back the promises of the support we sold. Also felt the backlash from angry customers daily in person and on the phone. I hated I couldn‚Äôt put the clients first, and had to deal with so much work overload. It was a very manic work situation in the end. Was unable to offer an honest day work to the paying clients. Everyone pretty much agreed it was a mess. But some of the leads have no choice, as it‚Äôs their family‚Äôs income... as they continue to try and find new work in the mean time."

However make sure this is the last thing you send! I know it‚Äôs stupid but adults play games. Right now from her tone...and I‚Äôve had the same speech she is giving you. She‚Äôs probably a little sad, but knows you‚Äôre there and an option to hit up at her connivence . You on the other hand don‚Äôt have that benefit, and it‚Äôs only gonna fuck with you. You need to go no contact and journal yourself here or on paper, in your phone and keep it private away from her. 

Trust me, she‚Äôs gonna keep you in the background while you get the brunt of it. Her wording seem that it was done, but she still cared, but it might not be done later ect. All typical things I‚Äôve had before at one time or another said to me. The more you let her know the more you open those wounds and she will still feel she‚Äôs in control.

Now is a time to just go missing from her life. You‚Äôll will get better and move on. I‚Äôm also willing to bet 30 days to 3 months she‚Äôs gonna not see anything from you online or a message, and hit you up as soon as you‚Äôre doing better. It always seems to happen like that. 

Stay strong and I urge you for every possible good outcome, to go off the grid with her now/NC while you still can and feel good about it. Don‚Äôt keep it going with this kind of one sided ‚Äúi dunno‚Äù conversation on her end. It‚Äôs a horrible limbo to be in on your side if you keep contact."
suboxone,fbw3uor,t1_fbryiwx,1577140446.0,"Yeah that‚Äôs how I‚Äôm seeing it after I was off 8 months. I hurried my taper for my gf at the time and just to say I was off, get some time off work and get on with life. Being on 10 years at 5mg and doing a 4 month taper, wasn‚Äôt the brightest idea. I‚Äôm just glad I can take 0.25-0.5mg and be fine with no issue. When I tapered from 5mg, and got to that low dose it was hard. So really it‚Äôs just like a reset like you said. While I take the 0.25mg, it‚Äôll give a chance for my brain to reset, coming off the bigger dose. Looking at it like steps in the long process of healing physically and mentally.

On such a low dose I can actually feel depression, cry and have strong emotions, as when I was on 2-5mg I was so complacent and didn‚Äôt feel those things. I‚Äôm taking this time to work on myself and plus side is when I‚Äôm ready I can just jump...or I can go super low and be less complications.

I know when I tried in early December I hit 4/5 days and felt the hard w/d but could actually sleep with the clonidine for 8hrs. That was impossible getting off after 10 years. So my detox should be closer to a 18 day thing next time in my experience, starting on a low dose and getting off a low dose.

My plan is to find work, go to school this January-May. But if I don‚Äôt find a good salary job by May, I‚Äôm gonna give up the apartment over the summer, move home and detox most likely as I won‚Äôt be doing anything and a retail job is not worth it to not take care of me. If I can pull a salary job, I‚Äôll stay on it with a water taper, skip days and when I get some vacation time do it again. 

That‚Äôs kinda the angle I‚Äôm taking now. But I still skip days and what not. But if I go 3 days without and beyond, I‚Äôm in bed for 2 weeks, which is way better than last time. I have hope!"

ExNoContact,fbivw8t,t3_edjdaz,1576916843.0,"Good for you. We did the break up at the start of February, still talked and then eventually hooked up over the summer and started talking. 3 weeks later she got a surprise job offer an hour away and nothing has been the same since. I just stay NC and give her space. But I have different user names and I see her post in forums I‚Äôm on every now and then passively, like its meant for me and that‚Äôs tough too. It‚Äôs like she wants me to know every so often she is absolutely not dating, her friend told her to go on a dating app I saw her on and she still cares about me but needs to be alone. It‚Äôs hard to read all that and get away from the online stuff. I‚Äôve done the blocking and all, but it still comes around especially on reddit if they know where you frequent. 

It‚Äôs def difficult and I‚Äôm trying my best not to get caught up in it."
ExNoContact,fbivkd7,t1_fbijigd,1576916375.0,"This is true. It takes a long time to be friends if it‚Äôs someone you still love and even harder if it was a long term. We just can‚Äôt be friends, and have about an hour distance between us now. NC is about all we can do. Problem is if we see each other we both know it‚Äôll lead to hooking up, and then a day or two later uncertainty. It‚Äôs a cycle that sucks and realized friends is not on the table. I‚Äôve been friends with ex‚Äôs many years later though, but just casual or online way. But the friends thing will just hurt and then hurt more when one or the other gets into a new relationship and they disappear, if trying to do it right after the break up."
ExNoContact,fbivaqp,t3_edm92o,1576916011.0,"Def! I‚Äôve had times where things are going well and I‚Äôm busy so it‚Äôs easier to get along through the days. But my situation sucks, because I‚Äôm in a small college town waiting for classes in January and searching for a job as I had to leave my old job of 5 1/2 years that kept me busy. With her she moved to a big city with a job that came out of surprise, right after we started talking again. She even had her best friend end up moving out there and they are single as well. So she has this big new life and I‚Äôm kind of living our old life. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a lot more difficult at times for me than her. The only thing that gets me is any contact we had before N/C or passive posts she made in other forums...knowing I‚Äôll see them. 

She stresses on how she is absolutely not dating, will always care for me, love me and all that stuff. Yet it‚Äôs like a hold or something. It feels like I get to suffer the brunt, while she is trying to have her fun, but not upset me, and really push she is staying single right now for me to see. It‚Äôs difficult at times, but I need to not read into it so much and move along. This has been dragging out a year of NC off and on. I really feel if she still lived by me, she be talking to me and that just makes me feel shitty. It‚Äôs only because she was doing that before the move. Makes the NC more complicated."
BreakUps,fbiulvy,t3_edi5nd,1576915034.0,"Mutual breakups and good term breakups are difficult. I‚Äôm in a weird situation myself where we stayed in contact for 10 months and got back together unofficially for a day or two mid summer. Since she moved on a job offer, it kind of sent any rekindling down the drain. We pretty much had your typical long term relationships issues, but still liked and loved each other. I had anxiety a bit like you and she had her own problems not knowing why she was so emotional or not feeling well about things at times, just very indecisive every 4/5 months after awhile. Also we worked on communication issues. All real typical stuff every normal relationship will have to deal with and be a point of breaking or working through it and staying together. But that also takes maturity and wanting to on both parts. Experience counts in these instances I found. My ex is lesser experienced than me, so I‚Äôm more NC hands off and stay out of her way right now.

I‚Äôd be careful with this though. If it was mutual you may end up scaring her off, if you try too hard. I‚Äôd wait a little bit for things to calm down and see if she comes to you after 30 days or so. Imo you got to come at it like a new relationship and fresh. Show some change and growth...otherwise it‚Äôs pretty much repeating the same thing. That just my experience. It‚Äôs best to rekindle it in a light, date night, subtle way, than to push it with any long letters or trying to go out of your way to overly explain things too much. Any talking seems to always go better in person I find, and keep any phone or online chat to a minimal till an actual meet up occurs. It‚Äôs so stupid, but these situations can have one or the other acting different after the fact, because they don‚Äôt want you to think they are weak or not doing better without you, even if it‚Äôs the opposite."

When a women can spend the same on clothes,eating out with friends, drinks and shopping in a month. I always buy one or two things a year, she would buy stuff weekly adding up.

BreakUps,fb3tcqa,t1_fb3suwu,1576488043.0,"Yeah, there‚Äôs just all kinds of people. I know people content living in an apartment together, some have mental issues and it still works. Then I know some that may have one partner who is perfect on paper with lots of opportunity, they didn‚Äôt have at the start and they surpass you in some ways. Those are difficult calls to make if you still love each other, but life is pulling you into different directions. Myself I‚Äôm playing catch up after a 7 year relationship where I was equal. But then doubts started happening, she got a better job offer than me, moved to the city. Now I‚Äôm staying back in a college town going back my senior year at 37 while she is 30 already been there done all that. On the flip side I have friends pulling 90k that have divorced, because their girl wants to party and can‚Äôt get their life together still chasing them. 

I hate to say, but I feel men take on a social constructs of maintaining stability and being equal or top dog. Women find stability attractive in a man, and it‚Äôs def in our DNA when raising children. While men can be successful and be fine dating or marrying a cute waitress that‚Äôs not financially stable and just want to love or support her. I‚Äôve found myself many times on both ends of the rope, and realized outside of initial attraction. The qualities both men and women desire on a primal level are completely different in some ways. 

I wish I had an answer and no ones life is perfect. I think as humans we overthink and conform to a lot. We have the consciousness to think about these things and get hurt. Animals on the other hand just mate and go through the life cycle. We‚Äôre just more aware and for better or worse have a brain that tries to make sense and add emotions on top. The same way we come to terms with death that other species don‚Äôt think about.

It‚Äôs rough and I think life is just living in the present, planning for the future and going along for the ride while adapting. That‚Äôs how I try to look at it"
BreakUps,fb3sgmb,t3_eb9wex,1576486630.0,"I agree somewhat. I think keeping the spark going and maintaining the relationship is a choice. As you get older and grow into the relationship, time, money, work, life goals, schooling, where to live ect. These all come into place more entering your late 20s early 30s. If your behind one partner, it can cause big issues. I realized this myself from dating younger. What a 23 year old girl is ok with is not much, especially if you got a good job and a condo. But bring it to 28-30 and now it‚Äôs an entire new thing. Your partner may want more than you can offer, or hard times happen financially or you want to live in a town and they want a expensive city life. Also the bedroom you have to keep it alive, keep putting work in even though you‚Äôre tired from that 12hr shift. There‚Äôs just so many things these days we all stress about, that in our early 20s aren‚Äôt that big a deal. Women and men are so different in what they want, how they feel and how they develop into adulthood. 

I went through couples counseling and all the stuff I mentioned and put in a lot of work. But I guess I should have put in more work, as looking back complacently of what I thought was a happy life...turned into an inevitable time bomb. It just became so complicated to sustain on many levels...emotionally, financially and physically. I wish everything was just 20 something puppy love and simple like that. People love each other all the time and leave due to growing apart in all these ways. Sometimes it‚Äôs down to timing, and being on the same page at that crucial turning point in life. Everyone is different, but the modern day world and dating has become so complicated imo, in comparison to our parents that bought a house and married at a young age."

But something about the app feels like a casino game and the gold and pay walls. As a guy I was surprised how many pretty girls I just swiped no to. If I met them in person I may not. But it‚Äôs weird for me to not meet and talk in person with initial attraction and chemistry. I‚Äôve done online dating back in 2010 and every now and then, I‚Äôd meet someone cool. But a lot of times it was false advertising with slim angles or photoshop and 50/50. When that happened Id still be nice but leave early. 

We all have baggage and I‚Äôm cool with mental health, health issues, divorced. I can look past those issues and some niche things if it is right. But I cringe with the apps, being either hyper sexual 21 year old hook ups putting my health at risk, or it being a completely different person than what is seen online.

AmItheAsshole,fad37ld,t3_e8b87k,1575953938.0,"75k is still a lot of money to pay debts or sell a home and flip for a new or pay off a house! Hell, I only got 25k and it‚Äôs what I want to do with it. So far 10k has gone to dental, health, debt and school. Trying to get a good job so I can tuck the rest away as a nest egg. I‚Äôm receiving more through out my life but will be very spaced out. I do wish I never took my apartment in my situation and moved back home with the parents to stack up to 50k in a year instead. But it goes fast if you don‚Äôt watch it. 3 of my friends got several millions in the last decade and get 70k a year payed out. But for some of them it‚Äôs almost gone after a decade of not buying land, investing or working. Most travel and live in nice condos with no jobs the last 8 years or so.

One friend was the smartest! She bought a big rental property in mid city New Orleans in a nice area and lives in one, and the other 3 rented out at 2,000 a month. So she can take vacations and do whatever she likes at a whim with her theater degree. She‚Äôs pretty much care free at 37 to do what she wants.

Even my doctor has finally admitted it‚Äôs a thing. It played a huge role, but I‚Äôm sure some other things did as well like genetics. If you‚Äôre one that goes every 4/6 months and get a check up and use dry mouth mouthwash it can be prevented. But I started in 2007 so it was new then. 

Do some research on it for real, and you‚Äôll be amazed at how many stories come up about teeth issues on forums, but down played by the companies that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúpossibility‚Äù.

Arcade1Up,fac95lb,t1_fabu5gs,1575935490.0,"So they pretty much added the new screen/board and a light up marquee as a plus. I think going forward it makes sense to use the new screens and boards attached to the back. From a financial standpoint it makes more sense for mass production. The light up and stool thrown in is just an added bonus. I think with the street fighter they will continue to get rid of old stock and then eventually revision it with the screens they use now. I doubt they are currently manufacturing any of the machines with the old screens and computer. All the older stuff is back stock. That or they just drop street fighter. Which I doubt. Adding better controls is still more a premium thing. I put my own in and it cost me like $22 a stick and $1.00 a 2lb spring in my mk2, replaced the monitor in it and pit a PI in it, ordered a premium light marquee and it‚Äôs awesome!"
suboxone,fac70s1,t1_fabuh8m,1575934538.0,"I agree with all that.. but yeah the last part about gf/wives. I don‚Äôt get it either. My ex thought I get off and all would be ok after a few months of therapy. And it was some months/weeks and sometimes not. But she got inpatient that I was flustered after a long work day one day, and had to run an extra errand or two I wasn‚Äôt able to the day before, making me 15min late to get together and then broke up with me after 7 years and only 8 months of my being off sub. Then cited I just don‚Äôt put enough effort into spontaneously driving an hour away to the city and doing all these early morning spontaneous things...well some days I still have stomach issues off the stuff and being at Mardi Gras or a big city on New Years, or a Saints game party with no bathrooms is not gonna work for me all the time. But I hid and sucked up my personal PAWS misery a lot to make her happy. That she just will never know  

It kind of added up that the weakness I showed in my personal life off the meds, was unattractive and not going to work for them. But on the med I was able to do all these fun things at the cost of feeling a bit less or sometimes being emotional blunted. I don‚Äôt blame my my ex I blame myself. But I was weak and if the break up didn‚Äôt happen at 8 months and all fell apart I might still be off if she had the patience. I had 25k in savings, both full time jobs and the plan was to get off and a house and get the future rolling. I was ready to protect that at all cost. Then it left and I was tested and strained with financials, moving, school, confusion and previous depression I was fighting. It was just so much and left me confused, because I did all the right things. 

But I‚Äôm still thankful I was off 8 months last year. It allowed me to take a crumb now at 0.25 or even skip days. Hell before my detox last year anything under 2mg I couldn‚Äôt hold barely. So I was able to get back on a jumping dose. So I know I can jump anytime I want without a taper now, and I don‚Äôt have constipation or any of the side effects on the normal doses vs my new micro dose. That‚Äôs an accomplishment for me! I just have to maybe get to the root of my depression with antidepressant, therapy and get the rest of my life in order before I decide to do it again. 10 years at 5mg and a taper in 4 months was too fast I think and odds were highly stacked against me I know

I‚Äôve found with a partner off or on it won‚Äôt change the relationship dynamic much, it‚Äôs for you not them. It‚Äôs the stigma they don‚Äôt like and family/friends saying things that usually there biggest issues. They want you to be perceived as the normal perfect partner. But life isn‚Äôt like that. People take antidepressants that have huge complications like no sex drive, irritation, crying spells, dry mouth, insomnia and those give withdrawals and no one says anything about it.

Thank you for the info, and sharing your experience. This forum has given me so much hope today! I finished my class schedule today and got my advising completed, reached out to my network of IT friends and have one meeting up for dinner tomorrow to start working on my resume. I‚Äôm just going full steam for now and hope things will work out in time."

Arcade1Up,fabofnq,t3_e8fpf7,1575926310.0,"I think the cabs will be revisioned at their leisure. Once the cabs start clearing out with the old ones, they will probably take feedback and release revisions. I converted my mk2 cab with stereo, light marquee, Sanwa with 2lb springs and extender on one. Pi in it with a 4 waiting to go in. Great machine and I‚Äôve gotten so much out of it!  I think sf2 will see a revision but may be awhile till they sell current stock. I‚Äôm sure we know by summer at latest if it‚Äôll happen or enough interest is out there. 

There is probably a better incentive now that the newer gens use the new screens and game boards. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll mass produce one thing making it a second gen  than keep producing old, as the cost wouldn‚Äôt make sense to me. Same board different game vs 2 different boards just cause?

suboxone,fabheyb,t1_faa2of1,1575923272.0,"Start tapering now a little. General rule is drop 0.25mg every 2 week. I wouldn‚Äôt jump off anything over .5 but would try to get to 0.25mg for 3 days at least by end of April or the days before jumping. You want to clear out as much time as possible.. it can take a month to really get through the w/d. The hard w/d are usually day 4-15 but doable with clonidine and helper meds. 

I‚Äôll say I‚Äôve been through detoxes and have gotten clean then back on small doses after all that hell. A lot of success depends on your life and stress levels. The most successful was when I took up jogging the moment I knew it was gonna happen, set up legally time off work with my doctor in advance, had a therapist I saw starting week 2 to allow some sick time. Had a supportive gf at the time. It just was very planned out and in a low stress peaceful environment. Nothing that needed my urgency...that helped tons alone with cannabis big time and relaxing as much as possible to get through. 

It‚Äôs difficult because even after 30 days you will feel better and month 2 you feel successful. For me just dealing with stress of work,gf,family,school it was a lot and even months out I just was sinking in myself. I was recommended antidepressants and a bunch of stuff. Detoxing is just 1/3 of it for long term users. 

The people who tend to stay on low doses 4mg or less under a year seem to get off easier in the long run than those on for 3+ years. If still do it and I‚Äôve detoxed 2-3 times and learned each time my down falls. You gotta stick with it no matter what once you feel better! Everyone usually goes through typical withdrawals but after 1 month it‚Äôs different for everyone how they fight depression or anxiety as there body adjusts over the months slowly. The mental tends to linger after 30 days but most physical is out in 30 and ramps up day 4/5 and slopes around day 9 through 14. Then it‚Äôs just feeling fatigue and lack of motivation the last 2 weeks with some minor stomach issues. Middle week 3 I was on 2 vacations flying on a plain."
suboxone,fa9pje4,t1_fa9odo0,1575885002.0,"Thank you, it was just hard after finally beating it last summer and getting to February, 8 months free. Then to be back on it again. I really thought getting off it would be better after 3 months, but things got worse. I was in standby always needing to use the bathroom for 7 months. Taking a trip with my ex to the city or out I had to decline a lot. It was good to be off and like a badge, but my daily life took a huge hit, with mental breakdowns at work, depression ect. I was hoping I could do this quickly since I left my job 60 days ago. But with January coming up, I really need to focus and make big moves in my life. I feel struggling to maintain that being off sub badge is not worth possibly failing school, fumbling job interviews, stomach woes for months ect. Hopefully when I‚Äôm in a more secure home and financial situation, with my degree that can be my reward to myself. Worse case scenario I do good and get a good job after I graduate and eventually take a leave to do it or right after I graduate move back home and do it. 

But thank you, I‚Äôve been so distraught especially with my break up, returning to school as an older student and moving around so much after she moved away and trying to find a decent job. Sometimes plans just don‚Äôt work and I do wonder if I never got back on in February how I be...but I can‚Äôt dwell on that. It‚Äôs a new week and I need to go kick some ass lol"
suboxone,fa9o7rn,t1_f9ml4q8,1575882924.0,"A few days late replying, but I went 4 1/2 days and thought heavy on it. Tonight I took 0.25mg, not because the pain...it was peaking though. But because after looking at my 4 month 5mg/0 journal last year, getting 8 months out and back on, I learned something. I was suffering months off the med big time, I was out of work two months on fmla depressed and suicidal 6 months after I was off the meds. 

I have school coming up and need a new job by end of February. From what I was feeling, reflecting on and being on such a low dose. I decided I‚Äôm going to follow my doctor‚Äôs recommendation finally. He told me I should stay at 0.25mg and introduce an antidepressant. My last detox even 8 months out had me socially crippled practically from the adjustment.

So I decided I‚Äôm just gonna take my 0.25mg, start the antidepressant this week, focus on health and get to a good place. I need to be there for what could be my dads last Christmas. I was so depressed off the meds I missed all the holidays alone in a dark room last year. It was horrible. 

I think I will continue to skip days. And after 4 days taking off it should help get my tolerance lower to dose once a day now and skip days I‚Äôm not doing anything. Then possible try a scale of taper later on. Bottom line is I got caught up on what I thought would be 2 times a week and ended up getting me again as work flew by and so did the months. Was grieving a broken relationship and had suicidal thoughts come back. I even relapsed on 2 Norco at thanksgiving. 

So i think your advice may be better. I really had a BIG time adjusting off it last year even at 8 months. I didn‚Äôt know how real depression could feel once I did that 4 month taper after 10 years. If anything I learned I have to prepare more and let my mind adjust slowly along with an antidepressant so I can get it right. I don‚Äôt know when that might be, but I want to finish my senior year this year with no hiccups first and be healthy...then I think I‚Äôll have the mindset, health and adjustments I need. 

Physically I think I can handle, but mentally I‚Äôm not in the place period, and it took a lot of back and forth with myself to come to that conclusion. Trying to detox and then getting back on with a new plan can make most feel shitty. But I just could foresee how difficult it‚Äôs gonna be if I do it and how sluggish and mentally unstable I‚Äôd be commuting to school 3 times a week, bathroom horror commuting  an hour away and also trying to do job interviews very soon.

Next time I‚Äôm gonna have an actual plan and not say screw it because of stigma and just because I have a few weeks free time. It takes more effort than that. I feel some shame but I‚Äôll get over it. I only said I do it, because I had to leave my job, thought my ex might look at me in a better light,  and seem like a good time, but I‚Äôm not good enough yet."
suboxone,fa9nggb,t1_fa9loxw,1575881747.0,"Oh yeah the detox sucks for sure. When I did mine last year I got 8 months off. But I worked hard for that and was working out for 4 months and top shape health. My now ex and I had a plan at the start of year and I saw a therapist who helped with it. It felt like a long time but by week 3 most of the grueling stuff was over. What was hard was the after. You get this pink cloud at day 30 that you did the right thing and are free! Well, I found out I was severely depressed by month 3 and drank like crazy, sobered up month 4 and kept going. Was out of work two months being treated with antidepressants, and it took 7 months for my bowels to get semi normal. I couldn‚Äôt go anywhere to far from my house and was in the bathroom at work 2hrs a day! 

It‚Äôs hard and I commend those who do get off. But it can be difficult as it does change your serotonin. I found I‚Äôll probably need to be on antidepressants a good year before I jump again and be physically fit, have support and not be distraught like I have been. I wish it was as easy as getting through the withdrawals, but for me that‚Äôs just 1/4 of the battle and the only one I can say I can do. I know I can get off 120%!  But it‚Äôs the after and quality of life that has hurt more. Once you get over the anxiety rush and stomach aches come day 4, use helper meds/sleep and let the time go down. It just seems forever but passes quickly after end of week 2."
suboxone,fa9l8bq,t1_fa9knod,1575878564.0,"Egh, I gave up for now. I just posted about it I did get to day 4 1/2. But I was really conflicted. I don‚Äôt have side effects at 0.25mg-0.5mg. When I was at 2 and above oh I strained to pee with constipation.

But thing is this may be my dads last Christmas, I gotta get rolling on work now, got some bad news I wouldn‚Äôt be able to take my college courses I wanted. So now I can only take one at a community college an hour away. Also I relapsed thanksgiving on pills, yeah I didn‚Äôt tell anyone but you now. I started reading my blog detox of 8 months I was off sub, and i had a lot of issues more so than on the small dose now, because depression. As the poster above stated I probably have depression and the small amount is keeping me stable. 

I decided to hop back on 0.25mg and start these antidepressants I put off. I know I need them. Also cutting down the drinking and filled the house with health food. I‚Äôm not taking it as a defeat, I just know it‚Äôs a long process after the 30 days and after the lows I sank last time...I don‚Äôt wanna mess up my living situation or possible life right now. So I will get my depression and drinking in order first, get healthy and when I‚Äôm in a good position again go for it.

At least it‚Äôs a small dose and I will be still skipping days. So maybe the taper later will be a water taper and give my mind time to rebuild. I was on 10 years and jumping off was just a 1/4 of the battle I fought. I had severe depression and suicidal ideation 6 months off the sub. I wish it was just get through the w/d and you‚Äôre back to normal. But the brain does not work that way for some. I‚Äôm gonna just get help for my depression first and then pregame later out when I‚Äôm healthier and more sane. I got out of a 7 year break up and that has had me all over emotionally as well. I have to just put in more work than I have these last few months."
suboxone,fa90yaz,t1_fa4rkcs,1575859606.0,"Cons: I lost 6 of my teeth and now wear a partial, it dried out my mouth and just fell apart after the years. So dental issues is one. Urinary issues at higher doses 2mg+.  Big one I would have up and down energy. A lot of the time felt emotionally blunted with my ex. A lot of people have reported side effects similar. Mostly complacently, mid day tired with naps, not having enough energy after work ect.

For at 0.5mg, I didn‚Äôt experience this as much all the time or if at all on a small dose. But after 6 months that dose stoped working, and I knew I‚Äôd have to move up or stay on. Even on 0.5mg I was having mostly emotional issues come back 6 months after I restarted the dose. Started to get into drinking a lot as well. 0.5.mg and 3/4 beers at the local bar almost every other night. I upped my sub for a few days to 0.75mg at night when I felt emotional...and of course I choose to stay in or have one beer to socialize. I knew it was not sustainable and I have to move up to 1mg for 2020 possibly.

60 days today, I left a job I was at 5 1/2 years. My life is all over the place, but I have savings and some school coming up. May change my living situation again to save more in March if work doesn‚Äôt go well. The last 2 months was a very very unhealthy time for me with drinking, and in some cases abusing my meds on occasion, going out partying. It just didn‚Äôt feel sustainable and then I think of all the costly visits again and no insurance anymore right now. 

I‚Äôm planning to see if I can get through to end of December off sub ok enough, and then start an antidepressant I held off last year, before I got back on sub.  Hopefully it all ties in with school and finding new work...if not I guess back on some sub till my life is whole again."

AmItheAsshole,f9p2254,t3_e658dg,1575519459.0,"Wow NTA. I‚Äôm similar and do freelance from home, have savings and go to school. So I have a nice spot in a desirable area with an extra room,shower/bath and all that. It‚Äôs set up for a good bit of privacy. I have another friend that always has a 2 bedroom when he rents alone. 

However be WARNED.... I let someone live with me once and did not know how crazy they be. Turns out when I had to get the cops involved the state law in my area says, anyone who live in a place for 2 weeks has rights to stay there. I had to get his mother involved and family to get him out! He refused to leave and would leave his stuff, but sleep elsewhere and come by when I was out. Really horrible situation. Since I was subleasing it and I was the main lease holder, I‚Äôd have to go to the landlord to get him booted if it wasn‚Äôt for his mom carrying him off. At that point I could have been fined or lost my place. 

Since then I‚Äôve learned to only let a single occupant live in my place, they have to be employed with at least a decent job history and or someone I know 2 years or more. The last part helps, but acceptions are made. But I‚Äôm very weary of letting late night drunks, couples and people who jump jobs a lot stay or rent. I always set a 4-6 month term upfront and go from there. I look at it like an application. You always want to try and have someone who‚Äôs professional if possible be a roommate. I have a friend looking at my place now who‚Äôs a programmer, that works 5 doors down and I worked with 3 years prior. He is going through a divorce and no kids, wakes up early pulling in 60k and is an all around hard worker/good guy.

Never let a friend just move in like that. It can get really bad and legal issues can arise if they want to get nasty and you‚Äôll be at fault, unless you own the property yourself. Couples can be a hassle as well with guests over a lot, maybe the other half is messy not paying rent and I like my privacy. Many landlords even establish party rules, and how long guests can stay. I recommend you follow up on your state rules as you go forward, if you don‚Äôt own the property. Give them a proper 90 day notice."

I see so many older people 50 and above with physical or chronic pain and they seem to get along. When I had my partner of 7 years a lot of these things vanished, because I was too distracted laughing eating ice cream, going on trips together and after we broke up I realized I was starting to depend on her to bring me up. Then here I am and it‚Äôs a huge struggle. Every day I try to think what can I do to better my life? I was so miserable in a job of 5 years. Recently I ended up just leaving that job that had medical benefits, enrolling back to school, cleaning a little every day. And just trying to not think about my physical issues the best I can.

suboxone,f9m9frh,t3_e5leg5,1575447336.0,"It‚Äôs a tough situation if you been on long term. I did my first in 2007 from 2mg-0.5 and jump in 10 months. I slept through the whole thing with 5/6 days I was just passed out from the clonidine and took hot baths. By day 12 I was feeling better. The remainder of the month no sleep issues, but had minor aches when working a kitchen job and eventually left that job to heal a bit more. The second time I detoxed from 6mg-0.25mg after 10 years was rough. It did take about a month to gain some normalcy and bowel issues were there for 4-5 months.  

I got back on 0.5mg for 8 months after being off 8 months after 10 years. Today I‚Äôm going cold turkey! I may have a bad month or by day 4/5 just feel shitty for a few days, followed by minor aches. I‚Äôve realized the correlation of how long you take it. Those years def add up, and can make most of the hurdles during the taper and then a long sleepless month. I‚Äôve found 2mg to a taper I‚Äôm under a year to be the softest as you don‚Äôt have so much build up. You‚Äôll hurt a bit, but I didn‚Äôt find it as hardcore as a being on it with a taper for over a decade.

The biggest issue is getting back on. Why the hell would someone like me that was on 10 year and got 8 months out get back on! Well when shit hit the fan with heavier work load, gf not ex of 7 years left, I lost my apartment and shuffled around, started back school first time in 6 years trying to keep up with full time work. I didn‚Äôt handle these things well. My doc tried everything with other meds for 8 months. 

We came to the conclusion I have underlying anxiety/depression the sub helped and covered up and also he thought maybe doing a 4 month taper after 10 years my therapist help me with...may have been a system shock. So he put me back on subutex 0.5mg daily to get through the hard times and go back on my taper. Now I have a month off and will try again. 

Will it stick this time, will I be back on? I don‚Äôt know. But for me going through all I went through to get off and back on and off, I‚Äôm gonna give it a shot for 3 weeks and see where my head is at. If I have to go back on 0.5 again in January so be it. But I‚Äôm gonna try something different. I had many reasons to get off, but I won‚Äôt go through all that as I‚Äôve gone on long enough ranting"
SuicideWatch,f9jdkrs,t3_e5asgv,1575368916.0,"I completely agree. Then I had a coworker do it and leave a note I saw that said: Tell all my friends I loved each and every one of them;last sentence on earth. I have no idea how he did it so easily. But that guy was carrying a bible, guitar and never took off his joy division t-shirt for 3 months up to that. He just was walking on another planet I couldn‚Äôt step too. He even hugged me really tight, and a goodbye and then said nothing a week before he died. That was 2 years ago, and I shed a tear now in this moment. So anyone who says people forget, they don‚Äôt.

He had a close friend kill himself a year before and a few others, the whole day at work he was a mess. It set off a chain of suicides from his online buddies. It‚Äôs weird to think about, but I talked to him every shift for 2 years like it was a phase. He cried, walked out and came back in a lot. I just felt I went through that at his age he will get over it. 

He didn‚Äôt and I was left jaw slacked that he fucking really did it a few months after he quit his job. I went and saw him in his casket to pay respects. It was surreal and it still doesn‚Äôt seem real...and here I am. It was very real and I‚Äôve tried before. But this was a friend dead that wasn‚Äôt a drug addict for once, or someone with a burden past I knew of. He just had something wrong with his emotions, and felt things very extreme. Love, hate, fear, he just honed in on a singular emotion, and wouldn‚Äôt let go in those moments much like a panic attack or not able to escape... so on a one way track, unless he could come down.  I believe he was on the autistic spectrum although he hid it well. One too many disappointments, and that was it for Will. 

It was just a series of disappointments and let downs, although he got lots of girls, and was a talented person. He just couldn‚Äôt deal with emotions, and I suspect during an argument with his ex fianc√© he hung himself. 

She carefully hid the txts, till his mom got into his phone and saw them. I helped the family recover all his music, and it was a really hard day at work. I offered my services for free outside work as well to mix his music. We worked at Geeksquad/Best Buy together. I recently quit after 6 years, too much mental exhaustion and pain.

Only thing that sucks is it‚Äôs gonna be a long wait on preorders for that one. I got in on the second or third pre order batch of the model d when it came out. They kept pushing the date back every month. Took me about 3 months to get once it came out. Guitar center seems to get the hook up, but always puts an earlier date than other sites to get orders in, but it‚Äôs usually pushed back similar to what the other sites already ‚Äúrealistically‚Äù had up"
edmproduction,f9inwqb,t1_f9ie1u5,1575341735.0,I agree completely. I flatten my midi tracks and shelf them as clips in abelton to have alternating versions of a 4/8/16 bars. Then just turn the midi off and shelve it for back up. Keeping everything midi all the time you just get lost in changing things and also sometimes playback can differ each pass if not audio. I try to have as much audio as possible with only one midi track running while I‚Äôm working. I like to move fast and chop the good parts up to audio and keep pushing.
edmproduction,f9in5lc,t1_f9imk4w,1575341197.0,"If you‚Äôre looking for a good priced poly that covers all bases, I recommend a used or new deepmind 12. The desktop version used or new is priced really well! They are becoming very affordable at $450-550. Run it midi to your daw or get a keystep to go with it and you have a ton of potential there for a workstation that will cover the Juno 60/106 type sound as well as bass, ambient and many others.

Personally my first real one was an MS20 in 2014 and it‚Äôs mainly lead and bass duties with some ambient as well. Still one of my go to synths for starting ideas, and bass,plucks,leads. I also picked up a model d, but that‚Äôs just a sound I wanted in my productions and more a complimentary synth. 

So I say for mono bass an ms20 mini is great, and for poly all bases, a deepmind would be great. Anything else in the poly world, and you‚Äôre gonna be looking at 1,500 or more in a lot of cases for a full featured poly synth."
Arcade1Up,f9i63wv,t1_f9i4g2m,1575329176.0,"Interesting, I was playing it the other day on my modded kit, and it felt really natural on the Sanwa sticks and highly playable. I know with the snes and console versions we were use to using a thumb pad and it was still cool. Hell, house of the dead for Dreamcast I beat many times with a controller."
edmproduction,f9i5g2p,t3_e53rt1,1575328717.0,"Honestly with music, unless you are gunning to use the newest and greatest vst plugins, with multiples and running at above 88.2khz...you can make music forever. Did it back in the late 90s early 2000s with no analog gear. If you have analog synths you use heavily, and the bulk is stock plugs with 2-3 nice mix plugs then really you won‚Äôt have many issues on almost 90%  of computers. The first song to be done all in the box (but I‚Äôm sure they had nice mics and high end analog pres) was rick martins first hit, and that was what 1999? Goes to show making music isn‚Äôt in the the technology arms race, unless you depend on stuff like Diva and Serum to fill in 40+ tracks of your work flow. That‚Äôs another reason I‚Äôm so happy about real synths getting cheaper! I only use drum samples and an occasional vst synth. Other than that most CPU is reserved for mixing plugs, like eq and compression."
Arcade1Up,f9fav2y,t3_e4rpz5,1575264710.0,"I have a pi on mine and play all 3. You just will have to adjust the volume on 2 and 3 on a keyboard(- +). Some were made with preamps inside, and the roms a duplicate of that. Other than that you get a lot of other cool games. 2 button games go over well, street fighter style games, you just have to adjust to the button layout. I love mine and modded everything I could on it."
edmproduction,f9f7lzk,t3_e4t5nh,1575261747.0,"I‚Äôm there with you. I ditched my old digi002 and went with one of those high end mastering converters and an api lunchbox and spent a lot in 2010. So I have just quality 2 channel setup as I didn‚Äôt figure a drum machine. I thought about a mixer and going in stereo then cutting up the kicks and snares parts ect. But it seems dumb compared to a midi setup with samples. Look/ask on the r/synthesizer sub reddit. Those guys would be able to lead you in the right direction, most I see have a dedicated mixer of sorts."
suboxone,f9f6xyp,t1_f9f5swv,1575261219.0,"Yeah, but with school work coming up around January 6th. I got to do it by Tuesday or not. I got stuck on it wanting to get off for 5 years because I had to pay rent, had a gf living with me and health insurance I needed to keep. I have the time now, but from past experiences now 37, I know that free time doesn‚Äôt come easy the older you get, and you‚Äôre in adult life. I don‚Äôt wanna get a good job or go back to school and have to give it up to get off. So it‚Äôs kind of a situation thing... I‚Äôm low enough. I think I‚Äôm gonna give it a try. Spending tonight and tomorrow having a good day. I cleaned my place and got $280 worth of food, supplements, boosts, shakes, teas, cannabis and it‚Äôs all locked down if I choose. I‚Äôm a bit scared to do it again...but worse I get back on in 2-3 weeks because I don‚Äôt think I can handle it with my attention/anxiety and depression with school and work. I like to go another month of tapering, but I‚Äôm out of time. It‚Äôs now or who knows when I‚Äôll get another chance. In my 20s I had many chances to drop it all, but now I got to do something."
SuicideWatch,f9f5zwf,t3_e4pu54,1575260479.0,"I‚Äôve tried booze, weed, herion, coke, benzos..on my way off opiate maintenance meds. Can confirm they all get old after awhile and you just end up in the same place or worse...with an addiction you can‚Äôt rid yourself of because you have to work and be accountable for daily life. I still smoke weed but like once a week or so. If I do drink I try to go out to a bar with a friend or do online video games. It‚Äôs not worth using other drugs to feel better. I did for a decade, got off and surprise I‚Äôm depressed as fuck still. Experiences, achievements, exercise as stupid and repetitive it sounds works better...but I know it‚Äôs hard. Therapy is a good place to start along with little steps of self care. Planning your day the night before helps take anxiety and pressure away I find the next day..because it‚Äôs all set up for you"
SuicideWatch,f9f46dy,t3_e4p214,1575259098.0,"In a small town myself, break up after 7 years, jobless living off savings, been in bed the last 2 months with depression, and about to go through a 30 day opiate detox at home alone. I‚Äôm in no shape to go through it...but I‚Äôm on the edge at times too man. I was for 2 months, then wasn‚Äôt for a month and then was. It‚Äôs just all over the place and life can be a mess sometimes. I‚Äôm afraid of my own feelings and with my detox, feel it‚Äôll hit me really hard and I may go, I dunno. I don‚Äôt have any real advice. Just saying I feel yah, and hope things get better."
suboxone,f9ezcmv,t1_f97f2bv,1575255493.0,"I got off 6mg for 8 months and back on at 0.5mg the last 8 months. No taper pain because I started back on a jumping dose. I do get all the benefits with out the side effects. Wanna get off again, but if I don‚Äôt, at least I‚Äôm on 0.5mg steady for first time in 10 years vs 6mg. I count that as an accomplishment"
suboxone,f9eyx09,t1_f96s8g4,1575255162.0,"Man I got off it for 8 months last year and the shits never stopped. My stomach just never returned forever. But yeah I had to get back on at a micro dose of 0.5mg now 8 months. Considering jumping Tuesday, but not looking forward to the return of that. With the micro dose I have no sub side effects either, I had at 4mg plus... with straining to pee or frequent visits at night and dry mouth. I found an equal medium being on a small dose. But do wanna get off again, just not sure I‚Äôm physically and mentally ready at this point."
suboxone,f9eylur,t1_f96oz6w,1575254924.0,"You have a point...I was on sub for 10 years and also was a 2007 on and off person when it came out. I was back on by 2009 and off again in 2018 then back on in 2019. I‚Äôm sitting here tonight at 0.5mg-0.25mg daily and skipped days, supposed to jump Tuesday again...but I‚Äôm not scared of withdrawal. I‚Äôm scared of the after with trying to focus on school, depression and all those things we both know. I‚Äôve been on it a long time and while I‚Äôm at a low dose with a month of nothing to do, it‚Äôs the perfect time. But I‚Äôm also worried about if 45 days out when I‚Äôm in school and work if it‚Äôll eventually get to me and make me cave in and flunk out, stop working ect. I‚Äôve been on both sides recently 8 months off and 8 months back on. It def has its pros and cons. The hardest part is after the withdrawal for me and the pink cloud goes away. The w/d is just a waiting game and seeking comfort during the first 2 weeks or so and dealing. When raw emotions hit and I get months out it gets hard."
