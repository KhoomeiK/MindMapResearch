Futurology,fnaki59,t3_g06443,1586799075.0,"Coming from someone who has grown up around religion and religious people but is an atheist, I should tell you this, people will always believe in something. I've lived in China for a while and although they say they are 100% ""atheist"" the amount of superstitions and beliefs they still have (zodiac, lucky numbers) was so strong it was kind of strange. I think humans have a natural tendency to be drawn to religious aspects so to speak. Religion has existed since the dawn of man and is not going to go away ever in my opinion. 

Some kind of church will always exist, take for instance The Church of Perpetual Life, they're not christian or believe in any kind of God, they believe in immortality, and are called Immortalists. Even communism could be considered a type of religion (look at all the USSR states and communist China, they all had a main figure of worship - the head of state. Could be an example to your answer of what could happen). How I see it religion is ""a belief system"".

Another point, in the 19th century people were terrified that science was going to turn people atheist and be the crumble of moral and religious society, 150 years later and religion still remains very strong in society despite all this new technology and science that we surround ourselves with. (FYI the whole extraterrestrial argument doesn't work, or the whole dinosaurs and evolution argument would have ended all religions by now). 

The reason Im saying this is that even though you might say ""lets assume all people leave religion"", the truth of the matter is that there will always be some kind of religion no matter what happens. Even something like capitalism could be considered a religion. Money on its own is just a number or a piece of paper, its our belief in it that changes everything, you could say people even worship money. What Im getting at is that at the end of the day people will find something to fill that void themselves one way or another they won't need a government to do it for them.

What will happen to churches and what not? Just as society has changed over time in history people adapt somehow some way but these changes are rarely ever instant/happening just one day all of the sudden its gradual changes. An example to your question though is non-theist Quakers who engage in Quaker practices and processes but without god in the picture. Also do keep in mind that not all religions are theistic, several are non-theist."
SuicideWatch,fna77pu,t3_g0dgke,1586792332.0,"I definitely felt what you felt before turned 18. I didn't want the responsibility that would come as I'll grow into an adult. It seems so scary and uncertain. I was terrified I just wanted to end it all.

The age of 18-21 is honestly really confusing because I thought it was all going to come at me at once, it really didn't. Everything was a gradual process and kind of one step at a time, many mistakes but learnt on the way and definitely wasn't the end of the world. With more freedom comes more responsibility. There are definitely pros and cons in both cases of more or less freedom/responsibility. Everyone I know personally prefer being an adult than a teenager, including myself (honestly anything but a teenager I rather be a 7 year old kid).

I study neuroscience and I should mention a very important point is that your brain is still developing, and will be until you're around 25 years old, you say you can't fix it, however your brain will work on it for you as it changes. What you worry about in the future will definitely change as your priorities and brain structure changes, honestly you'll look back at yourself and think man some of the shit I worried about, so silly. So don't beat yourself up about this. Some parts of adulting can be hard but its not terrible at all, might seem daunting at first but honestly you just get kind of used to it and get to enjoy the benefits of the freedoms as well.

All Im saying is, you'll be fine, you honestly doesn't realise what you're is capable of until they've done it. And at university you'll be on the exact same boat as so many others like yourself."

Taking responsibility of ones temper if they have one, responsibility of ones health including mental health, I can go on.

Responsibility is supposed to be a very primitive masculine instinct for the survival of the family/tribe but because of nurture responsibility can end up waning or disappearing completely and I’ve seen it all too often in toxic situations where they promote irresponsibility - fuck girls without condoms, if they get pregnant, run, “STDs pff, I’d never catch one I can tell when a girl has one.

If you have major issues that comes from how you were raised by your mum I would really recommend this book called Mom Factor, and if you’re interested in psychology it’s even better, the book Boundaries from same author is a good one too. Do remember it’s never too late to change or improve and there will always be stumbles on the way, progress isn’t straightforward and never will be.

Ive had to deal with major outbursts from my father and he hasn’t been the easiest to say the least because of alcoholism but he always says sorry afterwards and that means a lot to me and him recognising his issues and simply wanting to work on it is huge to me. I would never in my life want him to pass away even though he can be very difficult and he does suffer from depression, him committing suicide would hurt me so so much more than living with his outbursts.

And also your mind will often make things out the be so much worse than it actually is, i suffered from suicidal thoughts for years as well but fortunately not anymore, but I know how hopeless you feel but I promise you you’re really not hopeless.

For some people simply being out and doing things in nature works a whole lot better at improving their mental health than antidepressants or a therapist. You can’t just say nah therapy doesn’t work, maybe not for you but for others it might, it’s no good to put others off from trying it because it might be the best thing for them.
Personally my suicidal thoughts went away when I moved away from the toxic place and toxic people, stopped all meds and stayed in the countryside for a while, this can sound crazy to some but for me it did really work, I’m not suicidal nor depressed anymore. Before that I was on antidepressants and I was seeing a therapist, he wasn’t bad, he helped me in other issues it just didn’t work for me in the aspect of suicide.

TooAfraidToAsk,exq7lcy,t1_exq5t8b,1566498896.0,I do want to mention that the universal psychological properties of colour are a completely different thing from the cultural symbolism of the colours.
TooAfraidToAsk,exq5t8b,t3_ctz6cn,1566498257.0,"I work with colour psych for a living. Blue is the colour of the mind and it’s psychological properties are calmness, trust and logic - you’ll see a lot of banks using this colour. Green is positive, reassurance, balance and peace. Orange is abundance, comfort and fun/passion (I’ll get more into how all this changes in a combination of black). Contrary to popular belief red is not for danger, it can be aggressive but it’s main properties are energy, survival and stimulation.

I’m sure the blues and greens have explained itself already why they’re used for the things you asked. In stop light green is a an a ok reassurance sign for go. When it comes to red with the stop sign it’s not a danger sign, red is a colour that calls for action because it’s so stimulating and and that action is to stop and take notice. It also increases the pulse rate and makes time seem to pass quicker than it is. Another contrary to popular belief red is not actually the most visible colour but it does have the tendency to appear to be nearer than it is. Blue on the other hand appears to be further than it is hence why it is not used specifically in traffic lights.

Back to orange, when combined with black it’s properties become the opposite, it’s a sign of deprivation. When it comes to warning signs it can be either yellow or orange combined with black, both produce a very negative reaction. In nature and aposematic animals this combination is actually one of the more effective warning signs communicating ‘keep away I’m not good for you’. This would explain your question whether these things are age old primitive and yes they are. For instance the reason green is reassuring to us is because lots of greens indicate presence of water and unlikeliness of famine, it’s a primitive reassurance.

For the blue berries being dangerous argument, keep in mind that the blue pigment is one of the rarest in nature, we’re more likely to relate blue to something other than poisonous berries, such as the sky or the sea. There are poisonous red berries but there are much more other things that are red too that are not poisonous, the combination of black and yellow though doesn’t have many other natural comparisons but ‘not good’ sign.
I do want to mention that we don’t know why for sure some of these colours give the psychological effects that it does it’s still being researched, some are quite self explanatory on a primitive level, but why these colours are chosen for certain things is because of the universal psychological effects they have on us, a lot of it is chosen in intuition because of evolution.
Hope that explains things for you :)"

AskReddit,eond0ag,t3_bsgy1k,1558709485.0,"Very young, good time is when they ask about how a baby is made, explanation can be kept extremely simple, that will also give the opportunity to say that someone touching them down there inappropriately is not okay and is not normal, neither is them touching someone else which brings consent into the conversation and letting them know that they should talk to you if they feel uncomfortable about someone.

Next talk can be when they’re a bit older in their preteens or teens when you talk about things like STD, importance of protection, bring up consent once again because it’s extremely important, especially in a time where they may easily be pressured into it when they’re not ready or even want it."

AskReddit,eona3jo,t1_eon962x,1558707684.0,"Depends on what kind of popularity though, I’m talking about the shallow kind. Being confident in oneself is much better than simply striving for popularity at school.
Massive majority of the popular people I know from school are doing badly in life while those who didn’t care for popularity but were confident in themselves do well."

AskReddit,eon90ss,t3_bsg6w8,1558707032.0,"You will have so many insecurities about anything, how many friends you have, how you look (especially with a still developing body but wanting to look like an adult etc.), what experiences you have - like if you’ve been to parties or if you’re a virgin or not (which frankly should be the least of your concern at that age), if you’ve had a boyfriend (which is not important at all), you may even be insecure or embarrassed about your parents, the list goes on. 
Matter of fact is majority of these things will be totally irrelevant to you when you grow up so try not to stress about it because it’s just your developing brain that is prioritising unnecessary things that really don’t matter at all in reality not when you grow up."
AskReddit,eon8160,t1_eon6f7c,1558706425.0,"That’s not the kind of connections you make in middle school or high school. Popularity at that time is virtually pointless and at times frankly stressful, only to realise none of those people will have contact with you after you leave high school.

Networking as an adult is different, it’s no longer about the sole shallow reason of having the title of “popular”, there’s more benefits to making connections as an adult and often times have long term benefits in many different ways rather than superficial short term benefits."
