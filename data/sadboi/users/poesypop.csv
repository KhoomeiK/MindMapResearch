HomeschoolRecovery,fqcf7jp,t3_ghhshl,1589256726.0,"Remember that everyone is mostly thinking about themselves, so all the little awkward things you're picking up about yourself probably go largely unnoticed. We tend to think everyone's noticing us as much as we are noticing ourselves, they call it the spotlight effect in psychology. But they really aren't.

I know for me it's easy to put more socially experienced people on pedestals. They seem like they know all the right things to say, while I'm just making shit up as I go along. But the longer I've been away from home, almost seven years now, I've realized they're all just winging it too. There is no perfect script you're failing. Awkward silences and conversational dead-ends are just part of it for everyone. 

On a more practical level, I find conversations roll easier if I give specific details. If someone asks me how I am, it works better if I say ""Well today I spent three hours in bad 90s true crime YouTube spiral and ate my weight in potato chips"" than just good/tired or whatever. Also don't feel bad to run on about yourself if there's a lull in the conversation, it's totally fine to just bullshit about how you've been thinking about dyeing your hair red or learning spanish or writing a novel, even if it's kind of random. It feels shallow and self-centered, but it often leads to deeper stuff. And they'll chime in with ""oh me too"" somewhere along the line and you can turn it back on them.

It's hard to motivate yourself to self-educate without a teacher or parent paying attention, especially when you're dealing with mental health stuff and when home isn't a good calm place to work. 

I agree with your other commenter that prepping for the GED is the place to start, they had great recommendations on how to go about that. Khan Academy is great for most subjects, and you can track your progress which always feels good. Coursera is another great option, you can take online classes for free and interact with other students, which might help with the loneliness. 

For day-to-day, I'd create a homework space in your house if you can. A desk or an armchair or anywhere you can clear away the clutter and distractions and sit down to work. Then I'd set aside a time every day to study, say 10am, and start as small as setting a timer for 20 or 30 mins. Make yourself a cup of tea, turn off your phone, and set a timer. The important thing is to show up every school day in the same spot at the same time so you can begin the build a habit.

But like I said before, it's not that I want to give up free will, I'm unsatisfied that the options have to be limited to either continuing the cycle of abuse or giving up free will. If there's a God, and he's the god of the bible, and he was able to create both Eden and Heaven, then why don't we have both free will and a lack of abusers now? 

I was taught there were no carnivores in Eden but after a cursory Google search seems like there's no specific verse about it. I'm more interested in human abusers, since we don't have to eat each other to live."
Christianity,fdyor9b,t1_fdu27kb,1578782063.0,"I feel like I'm just saying the same thing over and over. I can't imagine a different way for the world to be constructed.

To say he's incapable of creating such a world is a logical conclusion, but then he's not all-powerful. Besides, according to the bible, he's already done it, first with Eden, eventually with Heaven. 

I don't really care if you personally have empathy, but your perspective on ""randomness"" lacks it. Maybe this is just leftover from studying Jesus back in the day (over the Old Testament), but I don't believe any logic system that doesn't include empathy can have the full truth.

At this point we're just arguing the same things and I'm finding it pointless. We're not going to convince each other."
Christianity,fdsafl1,t1_fdpyzw6,1578698074.0,"I agree that there is no evil. I'm not sure the bible would, but it looks like you've decided to cherry pick the text so it doesn't really matter. People operate based on their needs. If they have everything they need from every tier of Maslow's pyramid, they'll be well adjusted, content, kind, and productive in society. If they're missing something, they'll look for it in the wrong places. (And you're right, biology affects us too. Most serial killers suffered a major head injury before their killing sprees). Maybe Hitler never got the message that his voice mattered. Maybe he was uncomfortable with differences because he was never allowed to be different, we know he was abused by his father for any perceived failures at the military school he attended. Maybe losing so many siblings at such a young age made him cut off all empathy, making it almost impossible to make real relational ties. That kind of emotional isolation is so destructive. I think there is some personal choice in there, there are plenty of people who have suffered abuse and loss who didn't go on to become abusers themselves, let alone commit genocide. But I don't think Hitler is ""evil"" in the sense that he had something irrevocably dark in his soul that ""good"" people don't. He was damaged, and he chose to indulge the impulses that came as the result of that damage. As a result he twisted into something horrifying. I don't believe he deserves forgiveness. There's no recompense for the decisions he made, the devestation he caused, abuse or not. But ""evil?"" ""Good?"" I think those are religious concepts tied up in the idea of souls and eternal consequences, not actual reality.

That being said, my heart will always be for the victim. I care a lot more about the murdered Jews than Hitler. Besides, caring for those victimized by abuse hopefully leads to fewer abusers. It's as productive as it is human. 

We need empathy for both. Siding with Hitler to prove your empathy totally ignores your cold perspective toward victims of suffering. Sure, include Hitler as a child victim, you should. Doesn't change what you've been saying.

I don't really think we're arguing about anything real anymore. This last round seems more personal than logical."
Christianity,fdp61dy,t1_fdmpj0b,1578620829.0,"I don't believe in a talking snake because I don't believe in the Bible. A physical snake or not, it's a metaphor that either can be trusted as a parable about God, or the Bible is nothing but an old book open to anyone's interpretation. Your view is not orthodox Christianity, some would consider it heresy. I don't care about the religion you made up in your head. I'm not responding to just anyone's odd little creative thoughts. I'm pushing against the Christianity that I was raised with, that the people in my life believe in or reject. I moved constantly as a kid, and as my dad was a pastor I was exposed to a more representative cross section of the church than most people. Pentecostal, reformed, southern baptist, assembly of god. When I moved out, I attended a tiny Christian school that taught me Latin and the classic texts, Augustine, Aquinas, Plato, Aristotle, through the eyes of the bible. I lived in NYC with a missionary group with their own perspective on theology. I attended a non-denom Bible college. I lived in a Christian community house for three years. In some of these places people talked about the snake perhaps being a metaphor for what God was doing. In none did people write their own story based on their own opinions, they had respect for the bible. Your view is entirely secular, I'm surprised you believe in Christianity at all.

Sure. Maybe life is a dream. Maybe people's suffering doesn't matter. But that's not biblical either. Jesus' heart was for the widows and the orphans, the outcasts, the weak. He *cared* about the quality of people's lives here on Earth. You can say God wanted us to take care of people because he's training us for what comes next, as if compassion is a badge on our boy scouts uniform, but what a small, self-absorbed way to see the world. That's not the kind of sight the bible teaches.

Christianity,fdlrg9f,t1_fdlgi9o,1578530731.0,"Yes, we're creating our own paradise. Suffering is absolutely the engine of by which society evolves. We're finding good in the bad, we use what pain teaches us it to help each other and build a better world. But that change is human. You could say it's divinely inspired, but I'd ask again why he didn't divinely inspire earlier. It seems like he was happy to provide Eden, a life without suffering. All I ask is: Why did he plant the tree of good and evil? Why did he allow the serpent to crawl into it's branches? 

To say there's a God who like a school teacher assigns suffering to us like homework so we learn and grow is an incredibly privileged statement. When my roommate was growing up, her family took in a woman raised by a satanic cult. She was born without a birth certificate because she was intended as a child sacrifice. She was spared that, but her life was an equal punishment. She was ritually raped over and over again by her father and other men of authority. She wasn't allowed to attend school and nobody cared enough to teach her at home, so she never even learned to read. She was completely isolated from anyone but her abusers. She was afraid from the day she lived to the day she died. Even when she grew old enough to leave, she had multiple personality disorder that coupled with PTSD left her completely unable to function. My roommate would wake up in the middle of the night to her screaming and breaking everything in the house. Or when another personality showed up, she'd have to rock in her arms this 40 year old woman crying for a bottle and a pacifier. Most of the time she was unable to communicate at all. She couldn't work or take care of herself or maintain friendships. Her pain was unimaginable, even the more mainstream satantic church would never condone the way she was treated. Eventually she committed suicide. 

Could you look at her and say: ""Well, God needs suffering to teach us lessons?"" Why does she have to pay the price for society's evolution? Is ""randomness"" fair for her? Is she really being lovingly prepared for the next round of existence?

I don't want a dream world that conforms to my every wish. I don't need my own personal heaven. That's not what I ask from a good God. I ask him to save little girls from rape and abuse. 

Your argument shows a stunning lack of empathy. This is a huge reason why I left the church. Apologetics completely drained of all humanity. Logic left alone to smile smugly at itself. Listen to what you are actually saying about actual human lives."
Christianity,fdlezef,t1_fdjyr3b,1578522589.0,"""I'm only happy and only good things happen to me"" seems shallow when it means I get to live an upper middle class life with a perfect house and a perfect family and a perfect white picket fence. It's not shallow when it means a world free of gross injustice, where everyone has access to basic human rights.

It's easy for you and I to say that suffering enriches life, makes us stronger, makes us appreciate the good, teaches us to rely on God. For us to argue the finer points of what really counts as ""basic human rights."" We are privileged, we have access to Internet, access to extra time to explore it, access to education that taught us to write and and read argue like this, access to enough relative stability to be able to think beyond basic survival.  What about people who have none of these things? Who are born in pain and die in pain? My parents are missionaries in a third world country, they can tell you stories that make you scream for justice. Not Someday justice. Immediate, crushing justice, and immediate salvation & healing. Tell me that an all-powerful, all-loving God is in the room with a five year old girl being gang-raped by her uncle and his friends that paid for the privilege... And says to himself: Someday, man, I'm really gonna get those guys. Someday that little girl will be safe and happy in my arms. You know, when I get to it.

I can accept that suffering is a given, I'm not complaining. I'm luckier than most. But I can't accept that an all-loving, all-powerful God would postpone his judgement until after people's lives. You scoff at the idea of a world where people never experience suffering, but isn't that what heaven is? If God created heaven, why would he leave us here on Earth?"
Christianity,fdji5pt,t1_fdjd4ua,1578471893.0,"Suffering is a spectrum, of course, always. I've been lucky. But what about the other people you mentioned? Orphaned by the Black Death, raped and forced to marry your rapist and maybe even watch him rape your daughters, lose child after child to what are now preventable causes? Do they get to claim that they've suffered? Do they get to ask God to stop their pain? 

I'm not expecting a powerful and loving God to give me every shiny toy that catches my fancy. What I would expect is an intolerance for abuse and a generous hand when it comes to drinking water, clothes on your back, basic shelter, kindness. 

I do appreciate my healthy days more since my diagnosis. Perspective is useful, it teaches us gratitude and compassion, which when healthy leads to happiness. I think we agree here. It's a meatier happiness than your friend's dream world where every BMW is her favorite color. Maybe a better word is joy.

But this kind of perspective is useful because our joy is limited. We have to ration it. We say: ""Enjoy the sun today, because yesterday it rained and tomorrow it might rain again."" Or: ""Enjoy that you can enjoy! There are others who were born in pain and died in pain."" You see this as the dualistic nature of joy itself. That while we might experience a good thing (getting a BMW), we can't see it without having experienced lack (I'm incredibly grateful to have my beautiful little beater car after years of bussing). 

When I say I'm angry with God for choosing between free will and suffering, I'm really angry that with his infinite imagination and infinite love he would create a place that requires suffering in order to see goodness. We can't imagine another way for the world to be. But maybe heaven is that world. Where we feel with every fibre of our being the green grass under our feet, the glass of water we drink, the bread we eat transforming into the strength we use for each breath that fills our lungs. Where we aren't spoiled and angry like toddlers because we've outgrown our incessant wanting. We've forgotten happiness in our joy.

I can accept suffering as the way of the world. I'm lucky to have a lot less of it than many other people. I can choose gratitude and compassion, and maybe even find my way to some joy. 

What I can't accept is that an all-powerful, all-knowing, all-loving God set up the conditions for this world where so many are in pain, and where we are so broken and numb that we need pain to even feel joy."

I would say if drifting apart doesn't work and you need an official friend break up, don't shame her. This isn't an intervention, don't offer an ultimatum. She already knows where you stand on her lifestyle. Just say the friendship doesn't feel healthy to you.

But you know her and the situation better than I do, so of course take all this with a grain of salt. Trans people especially need all the love and support they can get, society isn't kind to them, not even many secular liberal circles. But if you don't really accept her or enjoy her (not saying any of that is your fault, relationship dynamics are hard enough without such dramatically different values) that won't help her either."
Christianity,fdivxdl,t1_fdiesy8,1578452248.0,"I disagree. I've heard the idea that ""lust"" is just misplaced desire -- just seeking sexual satisfaction outside of marriage, that's it. If God created us as sexual beings, then I don't believe it's just to test us but to help us thrive in the context of a marital relationship. Why would wanting to have sex with your spouse be a problem? That sounds like unnecessary shame. I see no biblical precedent. Find your husband sexy! Enjoy looking at your wife! Tell them you want to jump their bones! Sex is great, and it's supposed to be. I mean just flip through Song of Solomon and tell me that isn't some sumptuous godly lusting."

Christian,fdit645,t1_fdhgis0,1578450477.0,"I'm so sorry you went through that, that's so much to have to carry. None of that is your fault. None of that is sin. Consent isn't ""I finally broke down"" or ""well I said yes to x so I should've expected y,"" and never ever ever should sex be a ""surprise."" That's not sex, that's rape.  I'll say it again because I wish I could shout it from the rooftops every morning: anything less than enthusiastic consent ISN'T CONSENT."
Christian,fdhhlue,t3_ekpjub,1578422815.0,"Porn and masturbation are healthy! When the church demonizes sexual appetite it just leads to unnecessary shame. People say it keeps you from seeking out a spouse, but that's never been true for me or anyone I know. They also say porn gives you unrealistic ideas about sex and bodies, but I think everyone is smart enough to know it's exaggerated as much as models and TV and everything else we're bombarded with every day.

I heard an argument that God's law for abstinence from all sexual things was a protection for the ancient Israelites similar to the laws to wash their hands before they ate. No condoms or birth control to protect from pregnancy or STDs. I don't know if you want to go *that* far in your sexual theology, but it's an interesting thought. Plus people got married so much younger back then, so you didn't have to spend a decade or longer after puberty for your first orgasm. Seems like a weird expection to me, especially if God created us as sexual beings."

Christian,fdhf69u,t3_el52im,1578421355.0,"Fasting is the worst thing to do when struggling with any disordered eating. It will just lead to more binges or send you spiraling into anorexia. If you're thinking about weight loss, whatever you lose while fasting your body makes up for and more, it slows down your metabolism to prepare for the next famine. I recommend Intuitive Eating, it saved my life when I was bulimic. I used to binge at least 3x a week, now I haven't had a single binge for almost two years. If you like podcasts, Food Psych is a great introduction. Otherwise google knows all :)

If you want to use fasting to clear your mind and bring you closer to God, I recommend fasting with something not food related. In the past I've fasted Netflix, coffee, music. Has always been rewarding."
Christian,fdhd6dc,t3_el6emr,1578420257.0,"First: This is not your fault. I've been there too. That's a lie from the enemy to keep you trapped in shame.

For me it was even fuzzier because my abuser didn't physically force me. I thought I'd failed God because I didn't fight back. I wish someone had taught me sooner about ""ethusiastic consent."" If both partners aren't happy & totally into it, sex shouldn't happen, even and maybe especially in a marriage. If your husband or wife is pushy or ignores your obvious disinterest, that's NEVER okay. So if even that ""smaller"" infraction is a sin, when someone's behavior crosses the line of sexual abuse it's completely and utterly despicable. You did nothing wrong. This is not your fault. Tell yourself that over and over again, maybe even say it out loud or write it down. For a while I had a post-it note on my bathroom mirror. 

Second: Anger is okay! Even Jesus turned over tables. What matters is what you do with it. Let yourself feel every inch of your anger. Forgiveness comes on the other side of anger, not from repressing it. Trust that God is big enough to hold all your worst thoughts and impulses. Let him do the work.

There's this beautiful verse I come back to again and again: ""everything the light touches turns itself into light."" Keep your anger in the light. Don't judge it or try to change it. Talk about it with the safe people in your life. Tell God about it. Read other people's stories of abuse. Keep sharing here on reddit. That's where healing happens.

I'm so so sorry you're going through this. Thank you for your vulnerability. I hope you're able to find some peace."

NoStupidQuestions,fbux1nl,t3_eelkgl,1577121730.0,"I appreciate you sharing your question & by asking with empathy! We can only learn from each other by doing exactly what you're doing. 

For me, my sexuality is a big part of how I express myself because I had to hide in the closet for so long. It's a way of working through internalized shame, saying: I'm gay! And I'm proud of it! And I'm not afraid of your opinion anymore! 

I also like being openly queer because our culture is so centered around heterosexual relationships, which you can see especially clearly through movies & shows or by how parents are so quick to say to a three year old boy with a female friend ""is that your girrrrlfriend?""  Being open about my sexuality challenges that norm. Hopefully just as gentle nudge, like ""hey, us LGBT people are here too!"" 

And maybe most importantly to my daily life, my shaved head and rainbow pins signal to other queers! Both as ""hey, you're not alone"" and as ""I'm definitely flirting with you, not just being nice."" Which is especially useful in the lesbian community, because girls aren't socialized to make the first move. ""Homo intended, dammit!""

Hope that's helpful!"

I also struggled with self harm on top of bulimia, and one night I had something kind of similar happen. I was recovered and healthy, but one night I went to the bathroom and purged my dinner. Without even thinking about it. Halfway through I froze like, what the hell am I doing?? Then went back to recovered living as if nothing had ever happened.

I don't think it means you're back to where you were in 2015. It might just be your brain suddenly reaching for something it used to find comforting, a missed circuit somewhere. Maybe you're backsliding, but it sounds like this was just a blip. It happens sometimes, our brains are imperfect. But maybe reach out to a therapist if feelings of self harm come back."
