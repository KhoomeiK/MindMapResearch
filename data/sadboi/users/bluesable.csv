SocialSecurity,fp7c04u,t3_ga5zue,1588367780.0,"If you have to have a payee then get a different one. She doesn’t have to be your payee. I was a payee for a friend of mine and he got a girlfriend and decided to change it over to her. I knew nothing until he asked me to meet him at the bank to close our joint account. He was able to change his payee and everything without me knowing about it or being present for it.. so .. ultimately... someone else may have control over your funds but YOU have control over who that person will be and you can change it at anytime. Also.. the payee has to keep proof for expenses and what they buy with your money.. if and when asked,  they must be able to provide the receipts to social security. So if you think money has been swindled you can ask SS to check into it..
If there’s someone else you trust then maybe take her off of your case and get a new payee for yourself"

SocialSecurity,fmvo76m,t3_fwv0me,1586424366.0,The stimulus payment will go to the same place your monthly payment goes to (bank account or check in the mail). You don’t need to file and you don’t need to register on the registration portal that was created for people that don’t file taxes. There is no course of action you need to take to get the stimulus. For those on SSI and SSDI it will be an automatic payment.
SocialSecurity,fmhwqo1,t1_fmgydm8,1586096145.0,"I filed the first year then the rules changed on the job. It was a courier position so I had to have and maintain and vehicle.. then all of a sudden the requirement changed to having two vehicles. One was constantly in the shop while I drove the other one, changing them out with each other as one was fixed and the other would be in need of repair. Things kept going that way while the pay kept going down (every 3-6 months the pay steadily dropped) and then I couldn’t afford the 350 to have them done and then pay the taxes too. By the time the last change happened I couldn’t even afford the gas to keep the vehicles on the road. I didn’t mean to let it get that far but the situation never did get to a place where I could do the taxes. I was constantly further in debt with vehicle repairs and rentals and whatnot that I couldn’t get ahead."

AskWomen,fjxqh3w,t3_ffcigx,1583680910.0,Most bad ass thing I’ve heard of.. ( while I didn’t see it happen it was a pretty popular story) .. a woman that had been brutally abused by her drunkard husband for many years decided enough was enough. She was a little woman and he was a large man.. so one night he came in drunk and abusive and he passed out in his stupor. She sewed the bedsheets to the bed around him which left him restrained to a good degree. Then she took out a baseball bat and EFFED his world UP! While some women are able to physically defend themselves with a few learned defensive moves.. this woman couldn’t physically overpower the man so she had to use brain power instead. Might not be the MOST badass thing but it’s still pretty bad ass considering she managed to give herself an advantage with just a needle and a thread. Moral to the story.. never underestimate a woman. Especially the tiny ones. They will resort to some unconventional methods and extremes when need be. Any man out there beating on ANY woman is subject to the tables being turned.
hysterectomy,fivksr1,t3_f9eef9,1582762305.0,"I’ll be having the surgery soon, so I can’t say much about the increase in libido from having the surgery.. but from being bipolar, while manic the sex drive is OFF THE CHARTS!!! For months at a time, for me. At first I went wherever my you-know-what took me. After a few manic rounds of that I started trying to channel the energy elsewhere. I redirected it into learning new things. For me it’s music. Playing guitar. Writing songs. Whatever you have even a slight interest in.. try reaching further than you normally would. I focused on learning songs I had no business attempting. Plus side is I actually learned the songs! And I had something time consuming to keep me focused. The drive was still there, every step of the way.. incessantly demanding relief.. thanks to James Taylor and Jackson Browne I had plenty of material to focus on and learn. If you don’t already have a niche then explore and find one. It needs to be something that completely demands your attention and focus. Something you think about when you’re not actively doing it. It has to be something you can really absorb yourself into in order to overcome the persistent sex drive."
confessions,fifgeow,t3_f7tx6m,1582389536.0,"Sounds bipolar-ish. When in a state of mania one might be sexually charged and promiscuous and open to sexual interactions with people they normally wouldn’t be attracted to, including members of the same sex (if they didn’t already have a natural attraction to the same sex) and the flightly business ideas and the rapid changes from one idea to the next sounds a LOT like mania to me.  When he started doing these things, was he sleeping and eating like normal, or was he hardly ever eating and was he up all night without being tired from the lack of sleep? Did he seem to have abundant energy and rapid speech? See, when people do these things just because they’re jerks like that, it’s one thing... when people do these kinds of things due to mental illness, then that’s a whole different deal. When people are undiagnosed then these things happen and the person that is sick has no idea why it happened. It’s like all your morals and values are flipped and you’re not even in control anymore until the mania wears off. He may not be bipolar at all and if that’s the case then he’s an asshole.. but if it seems like he may be having a mental issue then do what you have to do to make yourself happy but try not to take the things he did so personally and just know he wouldn’t have done those things if not for mania. If he is sick then he’ll end up diagnosed at some point and he’ll be able to consciously try to maintain things but until then he’s just going to go through the cycles unknowingly.. it’s a horrible place to be. I’m not saying he’s DEFINITELY bipolar but you mentioned thinking he may have a mental illness and if he does then it seems like it could be bipolar. People think it’s just a happy/sad thing.. or a short fuse thing.. but there’s so much to the disease that only a person that has it knows what all it entails and it’s so much more than the average person’s understanding of it. Sorry you’re going through this and hopefully you can get back to a good thing in your life. If he’s a jerk he’ll just keep being that way but if he’s sick then maybe this is the thing that wakes him up to seek help."
musicians,fi69ai9,t3_f6lwpf,1582183937.0,"If you’re serious about wanting to learn then make sure you get something you can push the strings down on. It makes a difference. If you get a guitar with high action you’re going to be not having a great time. Doesn’t mean you have to spend a lot of money.. one of my faves cost me 25 bucks LoL! But the point is you’re going to want to be able to put your hands on it physically before purchase. Go to a big guitar store to get a “feel” for different ones and get an idea what you’re looking for. Then if you need to get the price lower than they can go, look for your choice guitars on cheaper avenues. This is where pawnshops are a great because you can put your hands on them first. Also look up musician sites in your local area and see if someone has one they want to sell.. their guitars are taken care of and they accumulate quite a few.. some may have a few good ones for starting out on laying around and they need the space for other gear (and the money for other gear).

confessions,fhcwyd1,t3_f28e3o,1581472598.0,"A response from a victim here... I struggle most with the fact that neither my abuser nor my family members ever really would acknowledge what happened and that it happened and who did it. Medical proof that it did happen was presented and then the blame went to someone else that was in that household. They acted as if he’d been wrongly accused for a long time. Then when it came out that my other brother remembers and said it was so. Truth is .. I do have some memory of it too.. and I shared that memory with some family members when my other brother came out with his memories.. before you say it’s not possible to remember that far back (I was between 2-3 years old).. I do remember. I’ve confirmed the memories I had from back then with other family members. We were only at that house for about a year and I remember the car.. the house.. the locations of the rooms and the contents of the rooms.. all the way down to the hallway closet and it’s contents.. so.. yes. My memory does go back that far. Most likely due to the traumatic circumstances. After it was brought to the table It Seems they want to defend him over defending me. “He was just a child himself” “it’s more common for that to happen with siblings than you’d think” etc.... he was 13 (old enough to know better) He also let his friends do it too. If he were to ever approach me to try to talk about it I would imagine if he just said something like “I just wanted to say that if there was ever anything I’ve ever done to you that caused you pain, I’m deeply sorry and I love you and I want you to know that I’m here for you if you ever need someone to talk to” followed by a look in his eye and an expression on his face that says “you and I both know what I’m talking about here”. I would read between those lines. I would feel the acknowledgment. I would feel his sincerity. I would appreciate the fact that it was an easy subtle approach that I could either elaborate on or not.. it would be my choice at that point and I wouldn’t feel Pressured or caught off guard. We could look each other in the eye and know that it’s been brought to the table. I would feel resolved. I probably wouldn’t ever want to talk about it any further than that but I would also know then.. that if I needed to or wanted to, I would be able to talk to him about it."

AskReddit,ffsho9x,t3_euv96i,1580181944.0,"It should have been the awkwardness I experienced with my peers through the childhood years. It should have been the suicide attempt in the teen years.. it SHOULD have been the psychotic break a decade ago. But it was the symptom of hyper sexuality caused by the manic cycle of bipolar disorder. That’s some dangerous stuff right there. Not that the other “shoulda’s” weren’t dangerous stuff. But it was the one thing that stood out to me the most because I am the FURTHEST from what hyper sexuality is when I’m not manic. The difference. The person I become. The things  that I do while manic ... that’s what did it for me. Imagine spending a few months every so often.. running on extremely little sleep (I could outlast a well stocked meth head ANY day while manic).. extremely little food intake (a nibble of something every few days) .. extreme hyper sexuality (You’d rock ANYONE’s world.. even if You would have normally found that person to be repulsive) and no matter how much sex.. no matter how many people... you can’t find satisfaction no matter how hard you try. Imagine yourself breaking every code, moral, and value you hold yourself to without a single ounce of reserve. Imagine crashing down from that immense high into the depths of depression where you sink lower and lower as you recall all the crap your manic self did and all of the destruction that was left behind you, caused by you, and is ultimately responsible for the bridges that are burning between yourself and your friends or loved ones that got plastered by you and your mental illness.

abusiveparents,ff2xt4y,t3_erc3n5,1579528044.0,"Some people were just never designed to be in the company of children. So sorry this happened. Now you’re safe. Just do what you can to keep yourself busy and try to stay in the moment. Intrusive thoughts and memories will creep in no matter how hard you try NOT to think about it. Get a plan in place and a hobby to turn to to busy yourself when that happens. Also, seek therapy if possible. Know you’re not alone. Countless others have had these kinds of experiences growing up. It doesn’t make it ok and it doesn’t mean your pain is less, but it does mean that you are not alone in it. Reach out when you need to like you did when making this post. Read other’s posts. From people that have gone through childhood abuse you may learn some coping techniques from others that posted about it. Therapy really is key though. Pay attention to the little things that you now have in your life that weren’t there before. And to the things that were in your life before but now aren’t. The ability to cross the room without being abused. The ability to sleep without encountering abuse. The ability to focus and grow with support and love. (In this I’m assuming your grandparents are not abusive). Get some friends and do normal childhood things with them. Get involved in an extracurricular activity that interest you. Whatever it is... get busy! Stay busy and focus as much as you can on your future and the moment of now. The thoughts that cross your mind are not welcome to stay any longer than you entertain them. They can be fleeting or they can move in and set up house in your brain. (Think: the mucinex commercial)This is hard to break but if you consciously replace the thoughts with something positive (like gratitude) they will lose their potency and their negative effect on you over time. For example... thinking about when you were thrown through a wall. Look at the wall in front of you today and notice there is no body shaped hole in it and there most likely won’t be. Take a moment of gratitude for your safety. When hanging with friends and returning home to NOT being grounded for doing so.. be grateful. If you do that as often as you can you will retrain your brain and it’ll lesson the effects it has on you. Coming out of an abusive situation to somewhere safe it IS a hard road back to a sense of normalcy. This will take some time. Don’t worry. You’ll get there. In the meantime be mindful of how you feel and PLEASE talk to someone you trust if you’re feeling extra low."

Stop making the mistakes I make that land me in these kinds of situations. I’m also attempting to “detach with love”. Hard to do when I don’t feel much like loving right now. I really don’t like being stuck and in a situation like this.

There is nowhere to go to escape in the house that he won’t find me and keep going with the argumentative conversation. He will look everywhere (including the car) when he’s trying to continue a drunken argument. He will not stop til he drops. Most of the time that’s AFTER  the sun comes up. The night before last I found a spot outside where I could hide for a while unseen. It reminded me of hiding from an abusive parent when I was younger. Standing there, back LITERALLY against the wall.. hiding in the shadow line of some plants and whatnot is where I found my self the other night. I stood there for a long time hoping he’d go to sleep at some point. Last night I just didn’t even go pick him up ( he works into the middle of the night in a band). He’d gotten sober for some time. I guess he lost the control and the ability to hide his recent relapse very well. So, as of recently he’s been coming home from these gigs drunk as ever before and fights with me all night. I gave him rides (he lost his license, DUI) to the gigs and back .. happily .. when he was sober and the purpose was to play music and make money that he actually came home with. For the past few weeks he’s just been coming home broke and drunk and now I know it’ll be a crap deal when he gets home. So ... I didn’t even go get him last night.  I think I’m done taking him to the gigs too. Why enable him with the transportation to the place he drinks and then go out of my way (usually around 3am) to pick him back up just to have to deal with the alcoholic side of him until he decides to stop fighting and start sleeping? We were going to be moving out of state together come March but there’s no way I’m going forward with him. I’m slipping out the back door when I have the funds together and blocking him from all forms of communication when I do. Having said that... it’ll still be about 4 weeks before I can leave so... 4 more weeks of trying to avoid him when he’s drunk. Then! Never again... 
that’s my story for the moment. 
As for what to do in the meantime to minimize having to deal with him, without the ability to get a hotel or stay with a friend, I have to do what I have to do to escape him when he’s literally a few feet away. So I have to figure out what my actions are going to be. I figure if it’s not raining I can take a blanket and a pillow and go sleep on the beach. If it’s raining I can drive to a parking lot and sleep there. I’m beginning to learn some self control and not engage so much when we are talking. Not to call him out and say that he’s drunk because THAT just leads to some NEXT  level arguing and fighting. When he DOES pass out I go sleep on the couch. I don’t really have any advice for what to do about it when the “Q” is right there in the same room. It seems easier to just agree with whatever he says and don’t say a damn thing about the vodka laden elephant in the room."

Her own actions and decisions brought her to this point, not you. I’m not sure how old she is but if she’s a bit younger it may take her some time still to figure her deal out and handle it better.

BipolarReddit,fbh59zj,t3_eddhmq,1576865620.0,"I’m bipolar and I can tell ya now that over thinking this is going to drive ya crazy. With my swings I’m two completely different people going from one side of the spectrum to the other. Literally two different people. On one side I’m extremely sexually charged (to the point where if I don’t just stay the F home I WILL be rolling in the sheets with someone before the night is through and porn is a thing I’m a fan of.. but on the other side of the spectrum my sexual charge is a total dead cell for the time being and porn is a thing I’m not a fan of. Trying to explain it to a person that I’m involved with sexually is impossible. 
However.. aside from bipolar issues I find that if someone watches a lot of porn they tend to attempt what they’ve seen in the bedroom. Porn is entertainment and covers stuff that LOOKS good but doesn’t necessarily always FEEL good. Porn stars are paid to make it look good.  In real life though a lot of that stuff is quite unpleasant. So, she could just have a personal issue with the porn that has no relation to her bipolar and at the same time she could have no issue with it at all but seemed like a good thing to throw out there to avoid hooking up with you because maybe her sexual charge is dwindling. Once I’ve unleashed the sexual fury on someone and I start dwindling it’s hard to communicate that it’s me and not them. They really can NOT fathom that the same person that went a thousand rounds last week seems to have no interest now and they take it personal. The “dealbreaker” bit could just be her way of attempting to shut it down because even though we get that way sometimes it usually isn’t something we’re proud of and we beat ourselves up about it try to stop it if we can.. in my case I can’t beat it until it runs its course. I’ve left some very sexually satisfied but ultimately confused partners in my wake along the way and then when I come back around to my normal state (if there’s such a thing) I’m usually repulsed with myself and my manic actions. It’s SO much fun at the time but it really packs a punch when I come back around to the low side."
relationships,fbgte01,t3_eczy3s,1576858152.0,"So, so sorry for your loss. Your story sounds a lot like mine. I was about your age when I met the other half of my heart. Instant love. Deepest love I’ve ever known. I, too, tried to rush moving on. It landed me in relationships I never should have been in. My standards were so high with him being what he is to me, that I lowered them when I attempted to move on. Too low. A bad time was had by all in those relationship attempts. The guys were involved with a woman (me) that was nowhere near emotionally ready. Little did I know, decades would pass and it’s still the same. I’m not emotionally ready and most likely never really will be. While it is such a sad state of affairs to be in I can honestly say that I feel so blessed to have ever known him, even if it was such a short time. People search their whole lives over and a lot of them never find that kind of love. I’m one of the lucky ones. We didn’t marry and we had a falling out of sorts (instigated by meddling ‘friends’). He died so soon after that I hadn’t had the chance to rectify the situation. I wrote something many moons ago that I wanted to share with you. It’s a song that I wrote for him. One of many but this one pertains to the topic here. 
The first couple of verses were written while he was still alive and the last couple of verses were written after he passed. 

I would gladly let you know /
That you’re always on my mind /
Humbly I won’t deny it  /
This love is yours as much as mine /
If only I could let you know /
Somehow how, how about now /
That I’m getting older /

Happily I would let you in /
If you knocked upon my door /
Humbly I would make amends  /
We could talk and laugh of times before /
If only I could let you know  /
Some how, how I don’t know /
I’m still getting over you /

Chorus: 
Older and over they roll on/
These movies of our memories full of empty songs/
There’s nowhere to throw ‘em /
There’s no way to hang on /
And I’m missin’ you as sure as the wind blows

Painfully I’ve been loving you /
No matter where you go or what I seem to do /
Humbly I state the truth /
Here I am still loving you /
And I’m getting older.  /

I would gladly tell you now /
You were always on my mind /
Humbly I will now stand /
Walk head held high ‘cause you and I always knew /
You were leaving on the wings of an angel /
Let you know
Somehow, how I don’t know/ 
I’m still getting over you. /

Older and over they roll on. These movies of our memories full of empty songs. There’s nowhere to throw ‘em, there’s no way to hang on and  I’m missin’ you as sure as the wind blows."

If that’s the case then the people that ARE listening probably like the song and aren’t judging it, or you. It’s a vulnerable thing to put yourself out there in the raw but that’s just one of those things about being a creator of music. Like stage fright. It’s uncomfortable at first but it gets easier the more you do it. Also putting it out on a thread like this one gives you a chance to see what people think about it before doing the song live for friends, family or an audience. Having input from other songwriters might put things into perspective for you and make it less daunting to expose yourself live. I write very personal and raw songs. It’s like a stack of my innermost feelings and I always feel like people can see right through me when they hear my music and now the whole room knows intimate things about me while I know nothing about them.

Doctors had found evidence of penetration and we were placed in foster care. It was blamed on the husband (not that he was charged or anything.. just within the family he had been accused). It happened again while in the foster home so the 12 year old was caught in the act at that time and that’s what the medical documentation reflects. They claimed his innocence for many years then when it became indisputable they went with “its normal behavior between young siblings” . I personally feel it is criminal. A 12 year old knows better.

AskReddit,f93e2yp,t3_e359ag,1575056674.0,"Remember early 80’s they had power wheels. The ones that plug in and you drive them around like you have a car? They had jeeps, cars and police motorcycle options. I had the police motorcycle. These things are designed to go very slow speeds with a gas pedal and a brake pedal. 
I lived in the mountains and one day I decided to take it to the top of a steep stretch of a one lane road and ride it down the mountain at a monstrous speed thinking my brake pedal would function in that situation (nope). 
My older sister was riding a radio flyer red wagon down the mountain.. my brother rode a bicycle with no brakes (bottom of the shoes stopping power there.. ) then I rolled down after they did. 
I was rolling down the street with the plastic wheels barely hanging on. As I was finding out the brakes weren’t doing me any favors a car was coming up the road. So I was either going to hit the car going very fast or the other option was to turn into the ditch and hope for a grassy landing. I went for the ditch. Again. Nope. My head hit the pavement instead and it produced a gushing head wound. 
Now, we would have gotten into serious trouble if it was known we had come down that mountain like that so we had to make it look like it happened in the driveway rather than the street.

AskWomenOver30,f8odz4a,t3_e0yrdv,1574675725.0,"My ex blew through my entire maintenance sex reserve. He was extremely high maintenance. Possibly even a sex addict. I’ve had enough maintenance sexual interactions to last a lifetime. 
My current BF doesn’t enjoy it if I’m not really into it so, like the OP, we only do it when I’m really feeling it. He doesn’t pressure me about it. If a loooong time has gone by he’ll say something in a jovial manner hinting towards it but never is flat out demanding and he doesn’t act all pouty and passive aggressive. We have sex less often but when we do it’s absolutely effin’ GREAT. 
Going in a different direction here but I think it’s worth mentioning that being in a relationship seems to come with these expectations that aren’t really all that practical. Sure there’s the exception of a few but most guys when they’re single aren’t having sex all day everyday. Again with the exception of some I think women seek sex when they get that strong sense of horny. Which isn’t every day all day. Most likely male and female single people have sex about as frequently as people in long term relationships do. With that concept in mind I feel like relationships fail because of the high expectations in relationships to have sex when you don’t want to. There’s the flood of sexual activity in the beginning and then when things dial back down to a normal level they take it personal and It kills the passion. Then it kills the relationship. 
Some guys think that having a girlfriend or a wife equates ownership of said female’s vagina and that they have a “right “ to access whenever they please whether she’s into it or not. Here’s a tip for those guys... she’ll most likely hardly ever be into it if she has to keep going through round after round of unwanted sexual experiences. 
It’s like eating food at a barbecue ( even though you’re not hungry but you’re being polite) and then someone expecting you to eat dinner an hour later just because it’s dinner time and it’s been cooked and ready to serve. You can’t really enjoy the meal or eat very much because you’re not hungry. Maintenance sex is a waste of energy and lacks passion. Why have a bunch of “blah” sex rather than being patient and having awesome sex?"

I was left behind when my brother left. He did so with no contact afterwards. I missed him but I’m glad he didn’t subject himself to any further issues with them. I got out eventually and there was nothing he could really do about the circumstances in the meantime so.. he didn’t need to be further affected by these people. If there’s any way to maintain contact with your sisters then do that... if not then they will get out eventually. It’s a hard deal and it really really sucks.. but you can only do what you can do, ya know?"
BipolarReddit,f8fetbn,t3_e0iwj1,1574542462.0,How was it determined to have been caused by weed? I have these kind of side effects from my bipolar whether weed is involved or not.
BipolarReddit,f8felbr,t3_e0neoj,1574542326.0,I took it in the morning and it seemed like I would get extremely tired between 2-4ish. So I switched to night time. I don’t sleep much at night but it was like that for me before the switch so I don’t think it’s causing my insomnia. So either way I don’t get much sleep at night but now I’m able to get through the day without having to take a mid-day nap everyday. I know it was definitely causing the daily tiredness though because I never need a nap in the daytime unless I’m sick or severely depressed
AskReddit,f8ehi9d,t3_e0j26s,1574527723.0,"Before I was diagnosed with PTSD and bipolar I attempted to commit suicide at age 15. I had just recently left from a horrifically abusive foster home and wasn’t adjusting very well. I had had suicidal thoughts in the past, heavily, but what happened that night wasn’t even from being sad about something in particular . I wasn’t even thinking about suicide at the moment. I had gotten up out of bed to get something to drink. The family had just gone to the store that day so I looked in the cabinets while I was drinking some orange juice to see what new snacks had been purchased . I saw a large bottle of pills. And I just ate them. It was a 500 count bottle of pain medication and I swallowed handful after handful until they started backing up in my throat. However many it was exactly I’m not sure but it was in the hundreds..  No thought process about it took place at all.  I laid back down in my bed and tried to go to sleep but ended up vomiting about an hour later. Family heard me and figured out what happened and took me to the hospital. I remember hearing doctors say they didn’t think I would survive. It wasn’t until that point that I snapped out of whatever it was and fought to live. After a stomach pump and 17 days in ICU I was ok. I’m glad the doctors did what they could to save me. I wasn’t even thinking that night and I damn sure was too young to die. It was a glitch in the brain and it almost cost me my life.
To answer the question “would anything have been able to stop me?” That particular night, just simply someone walking into the kitchen would have stopped me. But overall I believe that whether it was that night or some other time an attempt would have happened regardless. The thought of doing it was never far from my mind and I think that it just happened because it was a repetitive thought that runs circles in my mind so much so that it just crept out and became an action with no thought process to it. 
Afterwards I thought that it wasn’t really that bad.. I hadn’t really taken that many.. I wasn’t really trying to kill myself.. these things I tried to convince myself and health officials. The doctor at the psych ward wasn’t buying what I was selling and ripped me out of my bubble of denial when he yelled at me in front of all the other patients “YOU TOOK ENOUGH PILLS TO HAVE KILLED AN ELEPHANT!! SO GO AHEAD AND TRY TO TELL ME YOU JUST HAD A ‘REALLY BAD HEADACHE’ ONE MORE TIME AND I’LL MAKE SURE YOU STAY THE MAXIMUM AMOUT OF TIME POSSIBLE IN THIS HOSPITAL “ 
It’s a good thing he said that because it made me feel like it was a pretty strong attempt which should have been successful considering I’d “taken enough to kill an elephant”. After that whenever I felt suicidal I remembered that experience and figured if that didn’t do the trick then whatever else I try might not work and I’d just be left living with the damage I’ve caused to myself rather than dying. 
But then again, I’m still here and that crazy ass spaced out mental lack of thinking moment could come my way again and who knows what could or would happen if my brain shuts down on me again."

BipolarReddit,f89u90n,t1_f85v1x3,1574380268.0,It is the only med my psych has me on. What else should it be combined with? I’ve been on it several months and it doesn’t seem to be doing the trick
bipolar,f877jea,t3_dzel2v,1574319201.0,"It seems to be pretty common. People go untreated for a long time while in a state of denial. I did. Decades. I truly thought it was a misdiagnosis. I had a horrible tooth infection and blamed the lack of sleeping and eating on that. Then when the psychosis set in I blamed that on not eating and sleeping for so long. 
I’ve had a few ups n downs since then .. each worse than the last and none have been caused by a tooth infection so... I guess they were right!Meanwhile I’m running 20 years behind on treatment"

AskReddit,f84mt6g,t3_dyl33l,1574254848.0,Ladies! Medical advancements left us out of the loop completely! Why is there not a medication (um.. beside the joke that is midol and besides taking birth control) for us at that time of month? Every woman should get a monthly script. 5 days worth of an actual effective pain med.. maybe some muscle relaxers and a couple of valiums. WHY have the marvels of medication skipped this subject? There should just be a wonder drug out by now with all the above in one pill.  Even if it were to be a handful of habit forming narcotics.. I don’t think a couple of days a month would cultivate a dependency on narcotics.  we shouldn’t have to be dealing with this level of pain during these times when there ARE meds out there that could help
BipolarReddit,f7z3xyd,t1_f7ydywp,1574104946.0,"I’ve been taking the limotrigine for long enough, I fell like if it was working well it would have been apparent before now. Whether it’s meds or mania I am glad to be feeling better now too. That was such a strong and long run of depression"
BipolarReddit,f7ycpvs,t3_dxsvti,1574092209.0,I’m in that place right now. My last round of mania was when my father died and it was the longest run of mania I’ve experienced so far. The crash has been happening for almost a year now. Maybe more. I’ve been on limotrigine for several months now and the first sign of this depression lifting has been happening for a few days now. Some passion to play music again has been creeping in which is GREAT because I’ve been waiting so long to be able to feel anything let alone the music . While I’m excited my passion seems to be coming back I’m also nervous that it could be the rise into mania. It could be the meds working too. First time doing the med mill and I don’t know what it means when the meds are working so either they’re working or they’re totally not! I guess I’ll know soon enough right?
