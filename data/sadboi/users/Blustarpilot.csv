It may take a long or a short while, I don't know. I don't want to make assumptions because I can't know what you are going through, but I can say that it will be worth surviving it. I dont know when but if the time come it will be. You are already strong and have survived so many days, so you can do a few more. I believe in you. I really do."

socialskills,fm44iyq,t3_fsz1pq,1585746312.0,"The easiest advice I can give you is try to talk to people who have similar interests as you. You could look up subreddits here and try to comment to people's post or even make your own.

Join discord and try to converse there with people of similar interests. Maybe even try some multiplayer games that interest you and make some friends through that.

While we are at talking, observe how and what other people write, how do they engage in longer conversations with others, how they start conversations etc.

You could also always try to talk with old friends or family you haven't heard of since a while and ask them how they are doing, and what they have been up to since you last talked.

Try to find new hobbies too and you can make friends while learning how to do that specific thing, and as a bonus you will have one more subject you could talk about.

Try not to overthink it and just go with the flow. And if someone doesn't want to talk to you  don't worry that's part of the progress and you can always find others to talk to. Just never give up!

I hope this helped to some extent! I wish then best for you, you can do it!"

Since then he called me a few times and we already talked about a second date. I'm trying to be cautious, but I also want to enjoy myself in his company.
Hoping it will go great for the both of us :)!"
