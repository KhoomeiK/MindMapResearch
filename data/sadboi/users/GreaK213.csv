The hijacker, whose skills were so bad he couldn't fly a cesna on his own (the instructors that taught him say it themselves), did a 180 degree turn after dropping the plane from 30000ft at a mindblowing rate, flew near the ground at more than 500 mph (which is very VERY hard to do without taking off again or literally crashing into the ground) until reaching and hitting the pentagon. The aftermath as you stated is very questionable. Footage all around the Pentagon was immediately confiscated by the FBI, no 757 engines were visible (Rolls-Royce RB211 engines, made out of materials that withstand temperatures between 3600-4500°C can't just disappear like that or be turned into dust); and those are just a few points..."

What we know is that it's way too much and the perpetrators of such crimes should be brought to justice. Regarding the halt of the stats, it would probably mean that the death toll has been much higher under Trump's administration but that's my hypothesis."
ShitLiberalsSay,faolb2q,t1_fao9x4g,1576266896.0,"I could've indeed been more clear on Trump's war crimes but in all honesty I expect people on this sub to be at least decently versed about the US' foreign policy hence my intellectual laziness. Also what I say doesn't mean I erase previous presidents' crimes. I'm focusing on one particular president here. I'd need to write dozens of paragraphs to condemn every president's crimes (what a shitty world we live in lol).

I briefly mentioned the current state of things as they are pretty much expected to be worse (from a leftist point of view). Also, Democratic presidents' actions rarely get the same amount of criticism in liberal talking spheres and even leftist ones because they are seen as the good guys ""or better than the orange man hAhA"" (e.g. Obama; Clinton)

 I might change my mind but as for now I don't like the idea of separating crimes by Democratic or Republican govts. I believe both serve the same corporate interests and that any crimes they commit should be looked at the same way and counted together.

""Democrats; Republicans"" are mere labels used to give Americans the illusion that they can change things by voting when in fact, nothing really changes; brown kids get murdered anyways. The president is a muppet and whether he is a Democrat or a Republican doesn't halt or interfere the foreign policy considerably. Hillary Clinton clearly stated she would attack Iran had she won the elections back in 2016 for example. To my eyes Obama, Trump and all the preceding presidents are equally bad.

I can understand how this could contribute to the myth of Trump being less of an imperialist. However, I think that the reality of things is known by the majority on this sub and doesn't need too much explanation. I wanted to focus on Obama as the crossposted pic clearly worships Obama with the idea that being a Democrat equals to being a nice and fair president whereas the truth is that he was equally worse to a Republican one, ergo both parties have same opinions regarding foreign policy politics at least. I hope I was clear and am open to criticism."

piano,f7oxin2,t1_f7owgdu,1573936842.0,"Exactly.

Thank you for your answer!"
piano,f7otcqn,t1_f7os1qi,1573933804.0,"Yeah, writing all of this already helped me get some hindsight. I do some research on my own and while I acknowledge the importance of Bach's works, it just doesn't interest me as much as other composers. I don't want my personal opinions to influence what I play because it doesn't work like that and I'm completely aware of it. 

Also, I don't think it's a technique issue because my teacher has been positive and told me I made huge progress since I started playing Bach and she wouldn't have given me those pieces if I didn't have the level. Why would I be writing all of this if I'm making progress right?! I don't really know either.

What I think is causing my loss of motivation is the fact that it's all so repetitive and I guess I want some variety and need to mature a bit when it comes to understanding Bach."
