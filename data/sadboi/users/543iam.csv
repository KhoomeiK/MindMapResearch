One day, I was having a massive depressive episode where suicidal urges were very strong. Trying to sway the thoughts, I reflected on all the things I wish I had done in life - like travel. 
I could well afford to drain my money and travel for 3-6 months before I die. Shouldn't I do that before I die? 
But... What if I die before I even touch that money? What the fuck am I saving for?! 

It was then I realized that this was another thing I had to be mindful about because I havd depression. It makes no sense to add to my misery by protecting my future if I'm not happy in the present. If keeping myself alive can be helped by being a bit more extravagant with myself now, I should do it. 
Not like I blow my money every month but I do put aside more money for the Now and to spend on myself. 

Maybe that's something you can consider too. 
Make a change up in your life. 

I'm also moving to another country because like you said, I just became so disinterested in the life I was living. I found a job in a country with less stress and stronger currency so I'll be able to travel more. 
For 6 years, I've been putting my career first and pushing myself despite my depression. Now I'm going to concentrate on putting myself first and doing all the things I wish I had done.
