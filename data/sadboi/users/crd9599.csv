SuicideWatch,f4r3f5k,t3_dlirsd,1571762058.0,"I’ve had the same issues with suicide hotlines. My phone has been disconnected for almost a year so I haven’t been able to call anymore or even text. And not just the suicide hotline, I mean everyone. I sit in my house all day and use the WiFi and never leave only person I have contact with is my partner who I live with. My baby boy passed away last November and I’ve been pretty bed ridden since. My whole life I’ve only had myself to rely on, with abusive family, careless parents, absolutely no friends. My partner can’t even seem to be able to deal with my sadness anymore. 

Beings my phone is disconnected I have no one to call or talk to or ask for help when I’m feeling this way. I was so desperate the other day for a human to talk to that I waited an hour for the “online personal chat” just to finally get through to a robot. The first thing it said was to give my name, age, and a brief message about what’s bothering me and I probably waited another hour and a half before realizing there was no person on the other side of that chat. No one was actually going to come and talk to me. 

I have an aunt and a few cousins who seem to still give a shit about me who come around every so often to “check” on me and I’ve told anyone who will listen how about how bad I don’t want to be on this earth anymore and there’s no reason for me to be here. Tried to find a therapist, no one in my area takes my type of Medicaid and I had to sell my car a few months back to pay rent so I wouldn’t even have transportation to get there. Every time I’ve asked someone for help they just keep saying they’re “praying for me”

I know exactly what you mean when you say you have no other options. Everyone I know seems to think I just need medication. You’re completely right, sometimes people don’t realize we’ve just been dealt shitty lives and can’t figure our way out and society makes us believe that there’s hope and help as long as we ask but when we ask nothing happens. 

I’m currently in bed contemplating if it’s worth it to just take the chance of the after life being all it’s cracked up to be for a chance to be with my son again. Also trying to find a reason not to. I hope you can find the same will to try. I know it probably won’t mean anything but you can message me any time. I know what it’s like to feel alone. I’m sorry."

I’ve never asked for help because I never had anyone to ask, I swore I didn’t need anyone and never accepted help when it was offered. If this hard time has taught me anything it’s that I DO need help and I deff do not have it all figured out the way my ego believed I once did."
mentalhealth,f4831dw,t3_djrh46,1571431703.0,Thank you so much!
mentalhealth,f47s0x6,t3_djrh46,1571427066.0,"Thank you. It means a lot. Sorry for your loss as well, our son was also younger than a year, only 6 months old. It’s good to hear things got better for her. Some days it feels like the turmoil will never end"
