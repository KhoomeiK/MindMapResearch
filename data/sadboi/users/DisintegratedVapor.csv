The most I got was ibuprofen and then they switched me onto Prozac because it was the only one that had ever sort of worked. But I've been switched on and off 6 different antidepressants from January to May of this year, not including the other 10 sleep or anxiety medications I've been given in that time. I've had several psychiatrists and they were not happy with my choice to stop taking medication.

I just feel like my body is polluted with all types of medications this year and needed a break from being fed pills. I even did ECT hoping it would help but it didn't. I keep my appointments and I am very communicative but none of the psychiatrists I have seem to help me much.

I don't find any of these methods helpful. Nothing can erase trauma and so far nothing has eased the stress.
