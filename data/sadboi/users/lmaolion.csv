Even pissing them off will never even things out or give the satisfaction you seek, tbh, and I've fucked up people's shit to find out. 

Another way to look at it is this: you can't get a second you've spent with or on them back, so don't waste even one more. Life is too short for it, I guarantee you."

TrollCoping,fge838o,t3_ex2psl,1580693498.0,"Long winded response ahead with no tldr cause I'm a wordy mf: 

It takes a lot of unlearning to be able to really evaluate without jumping to either an auto fully defensive or fully self blaming position in these matters. Usually we default to whatever coping mechs we built along the way, and when we self blame in full it gives us a sense that we could control whether rejection happens when it often has more to do with the person who made that decision than anyone or anything else. 

The key is to begin forming mechanisms that actually help us navigate life in a healthier direction, but it's hard without a frame of reference of what that direction even looks like or what nuero-pathways we respond to such things with should be used on repeat till we've hardwired ourselves to a ""better path"" so to speak. Still, once we have some guidance to practice with and forgive ourselves when we fall back from time to time, eventually succeeding in this, yay plasticity!!
 
Also, tere's often missing info but at the end of the day, when you have to try to actively hide parts of yourself that a long term partner will eventually figure out anyway because they might leave if they know? No matter what else, they aren't compatible with you. Ouch! Hate it when it felt so right in everything else, right? Esp if we get our hopes up or start relying on a partnership for anything.

There will be aspects about others as well that will be a deal breaker for you even when so many characteristics seem to fit well. It hurts, believe me I know, but also makes a ""perfect"" match that much sweeter when it happens.

It'll be amazing when you get that match where they accept your for exactly who you are and you them (granted some things aren't ok, like please don't accept even low key forms of abuse to force this) and may it last a long time."
