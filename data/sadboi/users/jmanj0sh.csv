I thought I was gonna get a bit older and know their families, and they would know mine, you know? 

Well I guess the point of this comment is that friendship is pretty damn arbitrary, some people are gonna be rolling stones, others are gonna be co-dependant on their friends to validate their daily lives. The best way to find friends is to just be you, but to work on yourself where you can. If some people screw you over, or don't pay you enough heed, legit, fuck em. Not worth your time if you aren't worth theirs. Find similarities that are real, not just smoking up or destroying your livers with booze multiple times a week and calling it 'the good times'.

Has patience and insane mechanics with the AWP and Rifles, better than misuta in pretty much every way, but is yet to be tested. If they could arrange a trade I think that would bode really well for both teams."

GlobalOffensive,fo7k3wq,t1_fo74jp6,1587579690.0,"I feel like they will push s2 sooner with Valorant seeming to attract a lot of the CS crowd. If they were to implement it before valorant is released they could have time to optimize it for the casual cs players (majority of playerbase at this point). Could also kill the game if it is hastily rushed and doesn't run well on 90% of player's PCs. So we'll have to see, but they should probably be implementing attractive features like the crosshair change and doing improvements on balance (maps and weapons) before trying to port the game over to a new engine."
Tinder,fo6t1go,t1_fo638rn,1587566180.0,This is quite cool. Seems to me these jokes are more akin to lessons or principals under the guise of humor. Makes you think a bit more.

GlobalOffensive,fo51zye,t1_fo4w11p,1587515800.0,"They're planning on picking up Xeppa and Leaf. Cam is leaving the team too. These two pickups are a gamble but I think they'll pay off very well. Leaf is only 16 but was sick to watch in MDL, same goes for Xeppa.

Xeppaa's mdl stats this season https://www.hltv.org/stats/players/matches/15839/Xeppaa?event=5151

Leaf's: https://www.hltv.org/stats/players/matches/17939/leaf?event=5151

Sorry for shitty formatting, on phone."
