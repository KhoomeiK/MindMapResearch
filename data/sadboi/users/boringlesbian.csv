If I fed her nothing, then she was powerless. That is when I became ""boring"". I spent the years before I could escape at 18, being as invisible as possible. Of course, she saw me when she needed something, but I reacted as little as possible. Took me years to learn to feel again and how to react ""normally"" to things."

bostonterriers,et6dsg1,t3_ca2c90,1562510447.0,"Bostons are very smart and can be very stubborn. Start training early and consistently. I've had three Bostons and all of them have been funny, energetic, non-destructive, and loving. Each had/has their own unique personality traits as well. My first, was very attached and liked to go wherever we went. My current pup is super independent and is a big chewer. I was worried that she would chew up inappropriate things but she only chews on the toys and and things we give her. Bostons are truly wonderful dogs."

ptsd,esfqyj9,t3_c7fqs8,1561932872.0,"One of my triggers is county music. Especially, country music from the 1970s and 1980s, but really anything with that twang sound. I have co-workers who listen to music at their desks...quietly. My ears pick it up sometimes before I consciously realize it's playing. I start to get nauseous and my heart starts racing. I immediately put my headphones on to try to drown it out. I wish I could say ""Hey, everyone I work with, please don't play country music at your desk. Thanks."" but I can't. I feel like it would be making my problem, their problem. I also avoid stores and restaurants that usually play country music over their speakers. Pushing down and dealing with it is exactly what I feel I must do."
ptsd,escm4wz,t3_c717r8,1561832942.0,"Over 13 years I went through 9 therapists. One lasted only one session when he only seemed interested the fact that I am a lesbian. Like, perversely interested. One was very young and wanted me to help her with her grad school thesis... as in proof read it. I knew more about psychology than she did. Just keep trying to find one that fits. I had two fantastic therapist and several who I learned somethings from but weren't the best."
AskReddit,es7yg2p,t3_c6b8e1,1561683390.0,"I went to the ER with a high fever and lower abdominal pain. They put me in a room and start pumping me full of antibiotics. Fever kept getting higher. 104-105. I developed painful diarrhea and eventually I couldn't eat anything. After a few days they decide to cut me open. I had an ovarian cyst rupture and spread infection throughout my gut. I developed c-dif. They put a pick line in....it got a blood clot. I then got sepsis. Oh, also a systemic yeast infection, including thrush. They kept blowing my veins. I eventually got an IV in my neck. I gained 50 lbs of water weight and my organs started to shut down. Eventually, I was stabilized and they wanted me to go to a ""care facility"". I said ef that and went home.

I remember lying in the hospital bed going in and out of awareness and thinking ""I'm about to die."" I was okay with that."

I once tried to describe a ptsd flashback to a school counselor and she told me I might be schizophrenic! That scared me so much! It seemed like no one I talked to could figure out what I was trying to tell them. It took a decade of therapy to find the words and the right therapist to get properly diagnosed. I never gave up, but it was so hard.

It was worth it took keep trying."

Right now, I seem to be just a quiet, middle aged lesbian that works in an office. But, then I have some wild stories about my childhood and 20s. I can see people thinking that I am lying for whatever reason."
