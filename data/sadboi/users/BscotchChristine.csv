The fishing pole is made in with the Squathe! If you click on the Squathe you'll see the fishing pole in the 2nd row down in the center. 

To track it you'll select the fishing pole and in the bottom center of your screen there should be a ""Track"" button. This will override any other item you may be currently tracking. 

If you ever can't remember which work station makes a certain item. The Crashlands Wiki is a great resource! :)

crashlands,f4u7dzj,t3_dl95sv,1571801115.0,"Hi there!

In order to use your controller for the PC you'll need to change your settings. 

First you should check that you do not have the ""Keyboard + Controller"" settings enabled as this allows for couch co-op play with JB. 

The second setting option could be the ""Assign controller to player 2"" option. 

After checking these options are disabled you should be good to go to control Flux with your controller. 

Hope this helps! :)"

Giving players the ability to freely name their levels means that we would have to moderate the names. We're a very small team so we'd rather put that time and energy into creating new content for Levelhead!

If you go into Level Details there is a section for you to add tags to your level details so you can let people know what your level is all about. 

Hope this helps. :)"

The bad news is that we haven't exactly gotten all the details figured out for mobile, but if we can make it happen it will most likely launch on mobile when the game is fully launched.

crashlands,ew24265,t3_cl9l23,1565037781.0,After conferring with one of the developers they think there may be some funkiness going on with the controllers. Some user's controller setup triggers a button press automatically they suggest un-pairing any controllers you may have connected and rebooting your game.

levelhead,euyj301,t1_euvb76z,1564103408.0,"All player made levels have a difficulty based on clear rate. 

When a player ships a level to the public it is published to the ""Marketing Department."" The level requires a certain amount of unique players and play time in order to graduate into ""The Tower.""

While the level is still in the Marketing Department it is still possible for the level creator to un-publish the level to make additional change or to fix cheeses. 

The Marketing Department does not have a way to sort by filter since players are required to put Exposure Bucks into a level to push it to the front page. The Tower has filters so you can sort it by different tags.
