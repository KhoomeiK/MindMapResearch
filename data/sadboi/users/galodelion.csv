depression,fbf4kcq,t3_ed0drz,1576801386.0,"This is true. I was walking back to work after lunch today and my body felt so heavy like I could barely move forward. Today has been an especially dark and hard day for me, I understand exactly what this feels like"
depression,fbf4ers,t1_fbf3v5p,1576801270.0,"To add some reinforcement to how much it helps having friends that love you and show their support, I just wanted to share my experience. I attempted suicide a few years ago, and it was a horrible experience. Dealing with surviving a failed attempt is so hard, because you are still just as miserable afterwards, as well as a whole mix of other terrible emotions like shame, regret, etc.. It meant so much to me afterwards, when my friends reached out and/or came to visit and the people around me showed me how much they were/would have been affected by my actions. Feeling alone afterwards wouldve probably led to me trying again. Never underestimate the power of telling someone how much they mean to you."
depression,fbf3v5p,t3_eczhm3,1576800869.0,"Firstly, you sound like an amazing friend. I think youre wonderful for wanting to be there for your friend especially during this time of year. I think your family is being really unkind and selfish to you, and inconsiderate of your feelings and your relationship with your friend, and the hard situation that she is in. If being with your family is not usually a positive experience for you, then thats even more reason to prioritize being with your friend, especially if you are close and fear losing her. When you are in a dark place, having people be there for you can make you realize you really are loved and would be missed-which may be what your friend needs right now.

Either way, I hope that you are able to do what would make you happiest and that your family doesnt make things hard for you by being toxic and manipulative about it. You deserve better from your family."
AmItheAsshole,fbcelxz,t3_ece4ul,1576722115.0,"NTA  wow, incredible. Great on you for supporting your kid and going the extra mile for them. It sounds like the food was great and you didnt ruin anything, nobody seemed to care until they found out it was vegan so sounds like a “their problem” kind of thing. Sorry your family sounds pretty unsupportive but youre amazing and definitely not the asshole."
Toreba,fbca60i,t1_fbc2q4t,1576719271.0,"They do actually reply to disputes, it just takes a really long time. I think if it opened too early on a ping pong machine they might actually refund you as they have done that for me before.  
They have answered cases in my favor before but theyve always ignored disputes about a claw closing before it even moved down."
Toreba,fbc9y1u,t1_fbbxj1l,1576719128.0,"I know they do eventually manually adjust the claw strenth if they find its too easy to win, thats why people always talk about trying to catch machines before theyre nerfed. The issue Im talking about never seems to be a claw strength problem as much as a thing where is closes way before it even moved down all the way, or just refuses to move down at all"
neopets,fb8oq37,t3_ebs3yi,1576618464.0,"Aw I wish that they wouldve given me my old account back. It ended up getting purged after they denied me access, no matter how much info I gave them. It had the lab ray (which took me forever since Im super bad at the games/earning anything) Anyways Im happy for you that you got it back! :)"

mentalhealth,fb8jgyr,t3_ebjzzc,1576615263.0,"Hey :( Im so sorry to hear that you dont have someone who you can talk to and that youre going through so much. I suffer from severe depression and anxiety and I understand how hard it can be to find someone who listens, comprehends and cares without trying to compare your problems to theirs or making it about them. Im so sorry, and I know how difficult and discouraging that is. If you ever want to talk about it, Id be more than happy to be that friend. Please dont be afraid to reach out if you need to <3"
mentalhealth,fb8ioke,t3_ec0ckj,1576614786.0,"Hey.. I know things are looking really dark and hopeless right now, and I know that it sounds impossible but things really will get better. I know its easier said than done, but youre strong and youre gonna make it. Things are going to change, slowly, and with a lot of patience and effort but they will get better.  Please think about the people who love you and care about you and how losing you would affect them. Suicide only permanently transfers pain to your loved ones, so please really remember the people who love you and that you love. Im here if you wanna talk, or vent, about anything or nothing at all"

mentalhealth,fb8hwd3,t3_ec19l1,1576614313.0,"I experience this, and I find it especially harder when Im not keeping myself occupied. I know its really hard to find the energy and motivation to do things when youre feeling depressed so of course its easier said than done.. for me I have found that the more productive I am, the better I feel - even if its just accomplishing small things. I understand though, and Im here if you wanna talk about it"

mentalhealth,f44uclc,t3_djdjx9,1571359021.0,"I  definitely agree that depression can have that effect on people. I have terrible depression and it really does suck the color from life a lot of times... people are moved really differently by things though, so dont worry about it too much! Could just be that type of humor just isnt for you. This happens to me too, but I wouldnt worry too much about it. Some people are just more reserved and thats not a bad thing.  
I think I used to suffer from that more when I was younger, similar to what munkustrapp was saying about being reserved about expressing yourself out of anxienty about how other people will perceive it. Depression x anxiety combo is real tough"
mentalhealth,f44t7x0,t3_djf7gr,1571358395.0,"I got onto reddit just now because lately (and especially today) Ive been feeling absolutely horrible and I thought, why not see if theres a place where people go just to support each other when things are hard, maybe I can find anything that will make me feel better.. I had to watch the video with ccs cause unfortunately Im not somewhere where audio is ok but your video really hit close to home for me. Thank you for sharing your story and your vulnerability. It so hard when youre in a dark place to see that there is still light, that youre gonna make it and that people care and to remind yourself that you matter, so thank you for doing that for people. I hope that your video reaches someone-- it definitely was something I needed to hear, and Im feeling a lot better now than I did when I went looking for something to snap me out of how I was feeling."
