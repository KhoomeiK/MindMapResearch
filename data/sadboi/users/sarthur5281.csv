bipolar,ey56hzo,t3_cvca55,1566823349.0,Yeah for sure!!!! So much so I have almost forgotten to actually take my meds. Things are getting better for me and Im so happy. The lithium addition is helping tremendously. I still have my moments but they are less intense. Great post by the way.
bipolar2,ewsr0hh,t3_cpwrke,1565733429.0,I dont have any friends. I know a shit ton of people but I sometime dont have the patience to deal with them. I will ghost the fuck out of them for no apparent reason. Im working on it though
bipolar,evjx8i5,t3_cjsp4g,1564571598.0,"I take one and a half of lamictal in the morning. The half pill sucks because of the chalky taste. The lithium pill for me is the worst, that fucker is huge and wont go down."
bipolar,eujx5bw,t1_euhhkfv,1563879922.0,Yes your spot on....I really wanna tell them to fuck off because they dont have a clue
bipolar,eu5ldgb,t3_cety5m,1563480005.0,Yeah it sucks...hang in there. Reach out if you need to vent
bipolar,eu5jvyn,t1_eu5ikus,1563479123.0,That sucks people are so fucking insensitive. My last job was like that..I was treated like a stray dog. I messed up when I told my boss I was bipolar its like he didnt give two shits. When I put in my two weeks I was let go three days after that. I told him I need my benefits for my medication and also for my daughter. That motherfucker told me I should get cobra which is about 1300 dollats a month. Luckily I started a job that Monday and I was able to continue my meds thank god. Insensitive son of a bitch.
bipolar,esg9s53,t3_c0cj3a,1561946987.0,Thanks...my current regimen is okay but I rapid cycle like crazy going through different phases of moods within a matter of minutes. My risky behavior has slowed down some (happens when Im manic) but Im still struggling. I just want everthing to at least be semi normal. Lately Ive been having suicidal ideation and reached out to my doc twice within a matter of weeks. Super good moods last about a week and a half then something triggers the depression. If it wasnt for my daughter I would've taken myself out a long time ago. I think I 'll give lithium a shot. Thanks for the insight.
bipolar,er60mjn,t3_c0cj3a,1560537407.0,Thanks
bipolar,er4ttvp,t1_er4jmi7,1560509600.0,What dosage are you on? Thyroid and kidney issues.....are they dose related?
bipolar,er3vrxw,t3_c0cj3a,1560474062.0,Thanks.....Im a bit nervous about it mainly because of me concentrating on the horror stories.
bipolar,er3nwd6,t1_er3nuw4,1560467947.0,Hey thanks ðŸ‘Š
bipolar2,eouye1e,t3_bt3il3,1558884190.0,I totally relate
bipolar,eojkcqs,t3_bqkxo1,1558639054.0,Yeah before I got medicated I was having unprotected sex with prostitutes. I didn't care at all. Now the brake pedal is totally engaged and for the first time in my life. I use waste hours of watching porn. I had to come clean with my doctor. Ever since then I take my meds and go to therapy.
bipolar,eofro4o,t3_brnz0f,1558541838.0,I take guanficine alongside moodstablizer and and antidepressant. The guanficine makes me drink a shit ton of water but i feel great
