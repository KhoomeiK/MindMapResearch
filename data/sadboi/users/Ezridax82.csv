SuicideWatch,fpxbk1h,t1_fpx5fea,1588979431.0,"Mindfulness and listening aren’t the only forms of therapy though. Example, I’m training in EMDR now... it’s not a talking therapy. You don’t even really have to say much. One or two words at a time is enough. But you’re getting so much done in a short time. (That said, it’s not a quick fix either.)"
SuicideWatch,fpxacgf,t1_fpwpsk7,1588978744.0,"Definitely if you get the chance, try it out. There are DBT workbooks which will teach you the skills w/o the full support experience if that is more affordable to you."
SuicideWatch,fpwa0un,t1_fpvgmmo,1588959815.0,"I became a counselor because of my experiences. I’ve had trauma experience, suicidal ideation, etc. I think it makes me a better counselor. CBT never worked for me either. Lately, I’ve been training to do EMDR, and it’s great. It’s not about talking at all. And it doesn’t just treat trauma."
SuicideWatch,fpw9iqt,t1_fpw5m58,1588959570.0,"DBT is dialectical behavior therapy. While some counselors claim to do DBT, they just use some of the techniques. DBT is supposed to be a team approach, with 24/7 access to a therapist. You’ll also learn different self-soothing and distress tolerance techniques to use yourself."
