offmychest,fp0npq7,t3_gadwp6,1588212992.0,You did a good thing. You made a huge difference in someone else’s life and those close to her just by giving a damn. Take care of yourself.
BPD,foaaie1,t3_g6ft9k,1587643186.0,"I’ve been hospitalized a few times and I lied to get out each time after a week of being there. For me, it got to the point that what they were preaching over and over wasn’t relevant to my personal situation. My experience has been you’ll see the doctor for a minute, maybe one time a week, and suddenly have a new diagnosis and are on new medications, then sent on your way. It didn’t help; it just numbed me. It’s uncomfortable and extremely boring. Being hospitalized is about ceasing the immediate threat: you trying to harm yourself. Outpatient is where the real progress is made. I did a partial treatment program and it was exponentially more helpful than any time I’ve been in a psych ward. You get to go home every day and don’t have to deal with feeling trapped in an unfamiliar environment. However, being in hospital does get the ball rolling and you do receive treatment faster."
depression,fbjqwl9,t1_fbhuat1,1576938519.0,"Your friends would probably feel happy that you asked to hang out. Maybe one day when you’re feeling a bit brave, you can try."
depression,f2tsy9b,t3_de9o2l,1570400009.0,"Yes, and it’s really good that you are willing to seek help. I know people always say this, but things will get better. Admitting you need help is a lot harder than most realize."

depression,exhop4d,t3_cssvqy,1566310521.0,"Because you’re hurting, and you just want it to go away. Talking to people can help, hearing from others that you’re not crazy, you just going going through a hard time and they hear you, and they care. 

Things can get better. It’s not always easy, but there is a life out there worth living."
depression,exho71k,t3_csszgu,1566310170.0,Have you talked to a doctor or therapist about how you’re feeling?
depression,exhnklw,t3_cstasj,1566309732.0,"I struggle with this as well. I try to only keep beer in the house to prevent me from overdoing it, and only buy a little at a time. I also give myself little goals, like to only drink after 12pm, no sooner. When that gets easier, I give myself a goal for later in the day and to limit myself to only so many drinks. It’s all about attempting to cut back a little at a time and rewarding yourself when you follow through. But not being hard on yourself as well when it doesn’t work out that way.

I know it’s hard to deal with and I’m definitely not at a healthy stage in my own drinking. Take it day by day."
depression,exhmrle,t3_cstr4y,1566309156.0,"Have you ever looked into electroconvulsive therapy (shock therapy)? I’ve read it’s used on patients that have hard to treat depression. 

I’m sorry you’re going through this. I can imagine it feels like the world is against you. I feel for you."
depression,exbgu03,t3_crzk5t,1566130918.0,"Have you talked to them in depth about what you’re feeling? It sucks to be under your parents thumb, it won’t always be like that though."
depression,exbfkbd,t3_crzk5t,1566130124.0,"I’d say one of the most important things is to be kind to yourself, don’t be super hard on yourself. Depression can be so horrible to deal with, just know it’s not your fault. Do seek help if you haven’t already. Try to get outside every day, even if it’s just for a little bit. Give yourself small tasks, and when you complete them, reward yourself. If you don’t get anything done, that’s okay too, because things are hard right now. Even if all you do is make your bed and that’s it for the day, it’s still something. 

Self compassion is key. People with depression tend to be extremely hard on themselves. If you wouldn’t say it to someone you care about who is struggling, then you shouldn’t say it to yourself."
depression,exbc6j5,t1_exbc3f8,1566127940.0,No problem. Things really can get better. Good luck to you.
depression,exbbpj2,t1_exbb3q3,1566127640.0,"All you can do is try. For some people it really changes their whole outlook. Doctors start you off slowly, and if it’s not working you can try something different. 

I know that’s probably not super encouraging. It can be a struggle at times. Speaking from my own experiences, when I’m on the right stuff it’s like a flip switched inside me. I can go to work again, I want to spend time with people, I want to engage in my hobbies and live life."
depression,exbavcz,t1_exbame5,1566127110.0,"Absolutely. When I’m off them, I only get worse. I can only speak for myself, but I have to be on them. I’ve tried it the other way and it’s like fighting a losing battle. I definitely try to pair it with exercise and eating right, because it’s been proven to help. 

Have you ever tried any before?"
depression,exbah17,t3_crzwod,1566126846.0,"I’ve had good and bad experiences. I’ve had some that have worked right away, and some that have only made it worse. I’ve been on a couple that have worked for a while, then after a year or so I need to try something else. 

Everyone is different, and it sucks to have to start all over on a different medication and wait and see if it even works. It’s worth it when you find something that works for you though.

 I had a doctor tell me that for some people, they have to change their meds every couple of years. I’m one of those people. But I know some that have been on the same kind for years and still going strong. It just depends."
depression,exb9pf3,t1_exavxl2,1566126338.0,"For sure. I have so much trouble keeping jobs. I’ve had over a dozen jobs because I keep quitting. That doesn’t look good on a resume. I definitely feel like I’m going backwards in terms of progress. School sucks in that way too. Commitment is really hard for anyone with depression. But despite all of it, I’ve learned a lot, and I try to use the things I’ve learned going forward.

Edit: a word"
depression,ex9q6ih,t3_cruf0x,1566092737.0,"All the time. It sucks when I have really productive periods, where I’m on top of everything and feel like I’m actually making progress. When the depression hits it’s like I’m starting all over again, and constantly. It’s a horrible cycle, like, if only I could’ve kept going I wonder how far I would’ve got by now. But I also understand with this illness, there are certain things I can’t do. I’m going to be slower going at some things. I’m going to have days where I don’t leave the house.

I’m trying to come to terms with this. There’s a way to make life work, I just have to find the right way for myself."
depression,ex9ow6w,t3_cruhum,1566092185.0,"Definitely take them seriously, talk to your therapist more about it. I’m sorry your thoughts are getting worse. I hope things improve for you soon. Take care or yourself, your thoughts are worth taking seriously."
depression,ex79w4w,t1_ex76pkl,1566057853.0,"I feel that. I’ve been in therapy, seen different doctors, and been in and out of hospitals for over 10 years, all while trying different meds hoping they help. 

I wish I had answers. I was just diagnosed as bipolar this year, which explains a lot of things and why certain treatments haven’t worked for me. I’ve been put on different meds specifically for it and I think it’s helping. The only reason I bring that up is you never know when the right doctor or a different treatment will come along and be the thing that helps. 

I’m sorry things aren’t working so well. I hope things start looking up for you."
depression,ex76bbx,t3_crnp4h,1566056545.0,I could’ve wrote this myself. Have you sought help?
depression,ewylasf,t3_cqnpui,1565883016.0,"I always regret self harming, so I try to remind myself how much worse I’m going to feel about it later. It’s not worth it. Just know this moment will pass. Also, trying to show myself some compassion in that moment. Instead of hurting myself, I’m going to baby myself as much as possible. If that means the only thing that’s going to make me feel better is eating a tub of ice cream while wrapped up in blankets in a dark room bingeing The Office, then by golly that’s what I’m going to do. 

I’m sorry if that’s not helpful to you personally. The main thing to remember is to find a distraction."
depression,ewyk0r7,t3_cqnu1x,1565882391.0,"I feel this. Sometimes I get so fed up with feeling shitty all the time I go out and do ALL the productive things. It’s like, getting mad at the depression and doing things to spite it. 

Good for you and keep it up!"
bipolar2,ewumfem,t3_cq3bj5,1565785974.0,"I’m 24 and I’ve had dozens of jobs, I can’t even remember all of them. I’ve already quit 2 jobs in the span of a month. The longest I’ve stayed at a job is 5 months. It sucks. Getting treatment helps with it though."
