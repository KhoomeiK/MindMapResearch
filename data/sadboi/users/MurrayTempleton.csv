depression,fqsye13,t3_exo6f1,1589623458.0,"today's my birthday.  I turn 27.

I wasn't sure I'd make it to 27, but here I am.  last year, my family decided to throw me a surprise party by contacting the one friend of mine they knew and asking that one friend to invite lots of other friends of mine.  The headcount for that party was.. 1 friend.  We sat around and talked awkwardly for 30minutes and then parted ways.  

I guess it could have been worse, 1 is more than 0, but boy did my situation really hit home when I realized that was the extent of what could be conjured up for a surprise party for me.  It made me magnitudes more despaired than if there had been no party at all.  

Which, as it so happens, is what will happen this year.  Thanks to COVID and thanks to the fact that I will be working during my birthday.  My work doesn't know about my birthday and I like that.  Something about being treated specially for one day and going back to normal is like some kind of cruel joke.  

If you had shown my current life to myself at 18, 20, 22, I think I would have had a breakdown.  But show my current life to my current self, and I feel like I can probably make do with what I've got."
SIBO,fqsy339,t3_gkrfst,1589623129.0,"My phrase that I've said so many times it's practically my catchphrase now is that /r/SIBO posts and /r/depression posts are almost interchangeable.  It's crazy how similar the symptoms and strife are that get shared on both.  

Anyway, as for your question, I go to a virtual support group for mental health.  I'd recommend looking up DBSA, NAMI, or anything else you can find.  it is mental health awareness month after all :)  also, heat is a huge help for me.  daily hot shower, heating pad, hot herbal tea.  emotional tension becomes physical tension for me very quickly, and thankfully they can undo each other as well.  I've been getting shitty sleep as well, hence me writing this comment when I should be going to bed, but practicing all the other good sleep hygiene practices (light levels, timing of caffeine and eating, meditation, etc) is worth a try.  Oh, and music.  Geez louise music is saving me these days.  calming me down, getting me energized enough to exercise, keeping me focused through my work, I'd probably gnaw an arm off after 8 weeks of quarantine with no music."
