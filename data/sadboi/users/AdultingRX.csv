I tried logging in from multiple browsers - didn't work for me. I tried incognito mode in chrome. Didn't work. I tried clearing cache/cookies. No go.

Here's what worked for me personally if you still need help after trying the options above:

1. Call customer service at: 866--692-9374
2. Make sure they have your correct email address on file. (mine needed to be updated)
3. Go to [bankofamerica.com/eddcard](https://bankofamerica.com/eddcard) and click *forgot username.* Check your email to see what username the site might already have on file for you.
4. Enter the username you received via email and enter it in the username sign in box
5. Do the captcha security check and on the next page, click *forgot password*
6. Keep the customer service person on the phone until you are able to log in to your account. If you can't login, have the CSR reset your password for you and try to log in that way.

That's my personal experience & what worked for me. It was worth it to be able to login and set up automatic transfer of funds to my main bank account from the EDD card. Hope it helps."

Psychic,fkpakyh,t3_feqv93,1584405576.0,"Was curious what else she said in her book after seeing this and found the prediction below on a page not too far past the page in the post image. It’s a pretty interesting way to consider reconstructing how our government functions.

Excerpt from book, “End of Days” by Sylvia Browne

“The year 2020 will mark the end of the U.S. presidency and the executive branch of the government. Let’s just say the American public will finally be fed up by then and leave it at that.

The legislative branch will essentially absorb the responsibilities of the executive branch, with a streamlined body of elected representatives, an equal number from each state, forming the new legislature, which will be known simply as the Senate. The “party” system of Democrats, Republicans, Independents, et al., will un-complicate itself into Liberals and Conservatives, who will debate and vote on each proposed bill and law in nationally televised sessions.

Requirements for Senate candidates will be stringent and continuously monitored. For example, senators will be prohibited from having any past or present salaried position with any company that has ever had or might ever have a professional or contractual connection to federal, state, or local government, and each senator must submit to random drug and alcohol testing throughout his or her term.
The long-term effects of this reorganized government and closely examined body of lawmakers will be a return of legislative accountability and public trust, and state
governments will follow suit no later than 2024 by becoming smaller mirror images of the national Senate.

Among the laws that will be enacted during the Senate’s first six-year term will be:
• the flat tax
• tax bonuses for those with careers in the arts, education, law enforcement, and public service
• national observance of all major holidays celebrated by all major religions, as well as a Day of Remembrance for Holocaust survivors, victims, and their descendants
• “neutering” of all male and female pedophiles proved guilty by irrefutable evidence as a mandated part of their prison sentence
• a public health system
• driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, even on the first offense, will result in mandated inpatient rehab and detox, and the immediate seizure and auctioning of the vehicle to defray the rehab and detox expenses.”"

candlemaking,fcavrd4,t1_fc9wqwg,1577577572.0,"I bought the soy wax from Amazon and just now researched the manufacturer so I could get more details about the wax from their website to answer this question. 

The wax I have is:
Natural Soy 125 (Golden Wax 415 - 5715-00-77GW) Wax

Here is the product info from the website:

100% Soybean Oil Wax

** Melt Point: 125 degrees F

** Melting Range: 125 - 135 degrees F

** Pouring Range: 100 - 110 degrees F

** Add fragrance 5 - 10 degrees above desired pour temp!!

—————-

I was using totally different temps. 😖I used temps based off online research which said add fragrance at 185 degrees and pour between 120-140 degrees. 

Oh my goodness! This is more intricate than I thought it would be. Well, off to melt at the soy wax manufacturers recommendation. Wish they would have inserted that info in the box. Will update with results. 🤞🏽

I know that large companies hire people to monitor forums and appear as ""the average consumer"" to comment on complaints about their brand and this seems very much like that. I posted on two other forums online looking for help and had a similar experience as this one. Seems VERY fishy.

And the solution may not be the simple “just think positive” advice many people try to give. I sincerely hope you don’t take offense to that question. 

Please see your doctor if you have insurance or check out a local mental health clinic. 

I have  felt like you do now many times. I didn’t start taking meds until I was 29, and even with my meds I still have had periods of deep depression and anxiety. 

Ok so back to the issue which sounds like Self-Esteem and Self-Worth....

I’m 41 years old and this is what I’ve learned so far that’s helped:
 
1) Are you comparing yourself to what others have and wishing you had what they do? If so, STOP. One of my favorite quotes I’ve come across is COMPARISON IS THE THIEF OF JOY. Also, I used to get mad at myself for feeling bad because I was more blessed than say, a hungry kid in a 3rd world country. Don’t compare yourself to others up OR down. 

2) Do any of your negative feelings come from what you “think” other’s opinions of you are? If so, STOP. If you’re feeling embarrassed it’s likely because you’re thinking about what others might be thinking of you. One of the greatest growth challenges we have in life is to not be concerned about how others may or may not be judging you - which I know is harder in the age of social media. Which leads to another of my favorite quotes, “THOSE WHO MIND DON’T MATTER AND THOSE WHO MATTER DON’T MIND.” The people who truly care about you will love you no matter what - keep those people close. And, everybody else, take some time to learn how to not be affected by them - their opinions of you (real or perceived) can’t affect your life unless you let them. 

3) Keep a SMALL WINS journal to track all the small and even big wins in your life so you can give yourself credit and see your progress. Did you get somewhere on time today - small win! Were you kind to someone today - small win! 

4) For a little self-esteem boost, text some family and friends and tell them you’re doing some self-awareness work and ask them what they think your strengths are and what you do well. It feels great to hear the positive feedback. 

5) Meditate. Learn to mediate it’ll help you find peace. Start with the headspace app with 3 min and work your way up. 

.....

I had to practice working on those two things for the last 4 years. In the past I’ve had some really cool jobs, like working for Apple in a corporate management role, working for a tech startup, working for a handful of my cities most popular radio stations, and today I have nothing. I drove for Uber for the past few years, sleeping in my car in San Francisco and driving back to my home city every few days. This past year I didn’t work enough to cover my expenses because of my depression, and I got behind on most of my bills. I got my car repossessed and don’t even have a home of my own anymore (staying with family rn). 

I felt like such a loser. What would all my old coworkers think about me? Based off what I post on social media (only the positive events of my life) people probably thought my life was great. What would they think if they knew I had nothing right now? 

Well here’s the thing I’ve been blessed to learn: WHO FUCKING CARES WHAT THEY THINK. And, most people are so busy thinking about their own lives they’re really not too concerned with what you’re doing with yours. 

Anyhow, I would recommend pondering ideas above. 

It also sounds like you may be dealing with feelings of shame. I highly recommend reading or getting an audiobook by Brene Brown. She’s one of the leading researchers on shame and what you’ll learn from her books is AMAZING. 

You may be in a slump right now because you’re being presented (and blessed) with a growth opportunity for you to change your mindset. Growth is painful. Massive growth is even more painful. Push through the pain and focus on what God may be trying to teach you that is preparing you to take advantage of higher level opportunities in life. 


Hope you have find the support you need to get through this. <3"
