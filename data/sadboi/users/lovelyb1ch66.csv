I work for a small Canadian retailer, right now we are surviving on our online orders. We’re also working with heavily reduced staff in order to stay compliant with the COVID restrictions. That said we can usually process everything within 24 hrs (except on weekends) but then it’s all in the hands of Canada Post and they’re dealing with extremely high volumes and fewer staff so delays are inevitable. 

But we keep getting 1 star reviews (often headlined DONT ORDER FROM THESE GUYS) and complaints even after we’ve explained the reason for the delay.
It’s frustrating and upsetting, especially since we’re retail small fry and reviews are important to us and our staff are risking their health to continue working. And our products aren’t exactly essential either. Sometimes people really suck.
