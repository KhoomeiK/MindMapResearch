I took the same combo as you for about 6 months and dropped the Buproprion. Those two medications are often prescribed alongside one another and gladly handed out. The problem is I think the Buproprion really gets overshadowed by anything it \*can\* help with by the Adderall, and then reduces your chances of noticing anything positive happening. 

I personally found Buproprion to cancel out a lot of positives about Adderall - Mainly that dopamine seemed to be stretched pretty thin between the two and ended up leaving me to feel like I was either not medicated at all and foggy as hell or very sharp and a jerk. No real round edges were ever made.
