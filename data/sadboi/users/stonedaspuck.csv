relationship_advice,fqxym2x,t3_glgmr4,1589739822.0,"If you want to maintain a relationship with your daughter do not kick her out. 

My dad was my mom & dad because my mom didn’t want to be a parent. They got divorced when I was in 2nd grade & my mom chose men & substances over us, which I know is a different situation, but not feeling loved by your mom is the same. I spent my whole life wondering why my mom couldn’t love me the way other moms loved their kids. It often made me wonder how anyone could ever love me if my own mom couldn’t. 

But what saved me was my dad. He is far from perfect & has made many mistakes, but one thing I have NEVER questioned or wondered was whether or not he loved me. 

I spent some years wanting to die. But I did not take my life because I knew it would destroy my dad. I resented him and borderline hated him through those years. Asking why I had to live in pain just so he wouldn’t. But you know what? After a lot of therapy I am SO grateful that his love never wavered because once I was able to live for myself, I realized it was knowing how much he loved me that allowed me to hold on until I could live for myself. 

My point being, please do not underestimate what an impact you can have on your daughter just by loving her. Show her you love her and will protect her by not allowing her to be kicked out. 

You can’t force a relationship between them, but you can give your daughter extra support that her mom refuses to give. She won’t forget it. I promise you that. 

My entire life is different now & im in my 30’s living a life I 1000% thought was impossible- all because my dad loved me enough for them both."

I’m going to go ahead and guess that the very real Jewish officer as well as the very real Jewish population has very real feelings of hurt to hear the anti Semitic rhetoric & Katie Holmes is a real person who had to deal the real Tom Cruise, not a character.

Also, you keep mention erections and why sexualize it, but other than puberty & sleeping - the penis generally (not always, I’m aware of this) becomes erect in response to sexual stimulation.

I don’t know if me being a woman dating a woman doing it makes a difference- but I never saw it as sexual. She’d constantly have people asking how she toned certain muscle groups and then would make tutorials - so that’s what I’m going off of.

For instance, let’s use Adam Levine since that’s your example - I bet there are times he’s singing or doing an interview & not thinking about being sexy, but that’s not going to stop people from sexualizing him.

Just like if people are sexualizing her for her videos, that’s not on her. It’s not cool to assume she’s doing it for sexual attention when she is probably just really proud of her work.

depression,fjwyhgz,t3_ff8mfz,1583649336.0,"I am so sorry to hear this OP. That must be incredibly frustrating, scary, and upsetting. Where you live is it easy to get a CT scan? I know you are worried about what you will find out, but the silver lining would be that you would find out whether or not you do in fact have a tumor, or if it's related to something else. But also, no matter what it is - you will get to start treating it. If you start trying to treat it, maybe you'll be able to game again and not live in so much pain. 

I avoid appointments myself so I really do understand, and it's so much easier to tell others to get checked out, but not follow our own advice. So please know that I don't say this thinking it's easy. I know making that appointment will be very hard. But I believe you can do it.

I think the fact that you posted about being scared is a great first step. Fear is a totally appropriate response to all of these symptoms, but you don't want to give in to and live in the fear. The unknown is awful, but waiting too long and finding out you could have prevented permanent damage I think would be worse. 

I wish you the best. You can get through this."
MagicalButter,fjwwrpg,t3_ff5758,1583647989.0,"Hi there!

So, I literally just infused coconut oil into my MBM for the first time last night, and made the MBM coconut oil gummy for the first time ever today so this question is excellently timed for me.

The minimum amount of liquid you can use in the MBM is 2c. Everyone I know with a tolerance uses at least 1oz of bud per or 1.5-2oz of shake per 2c. That is NOT to say you must use this as I know some people use half an oz per 2c. I think a lot depends on your tolerance, and how you will be using the base.

I used 35g of buds, decarbed it, then ran it in the MBM with 2.25c of coconut oil. I ran it on 160F for 2 cycles of 2 hours (for a total of 4).

Today I used the MBM coconut oil gummies recipe that states it yields ""around 30"" gummies. I looked at your molds and can't find any place it tells how much liquid each mold holds, but they're much better sized than the ones I have (regular gummy bear size). I had 4 sheets of molds and expected to use 1. Each mold holds 1.5ml of liquid and like a dumbass didn't consider that the recipe was likely using chocolate molds like the ones your getting, so while I expected to fill around 30 molds, I ended up filling all 4 sheets aka 168 molds and still had some leftover I poured in a pyrex dish and will cut like fruit rollups.

On one hand, cool, the gummies came out great - but on the other hand it completely fucked my dosage up. My intention was around 30 20mg gummies, and I ended up with around 168 2-4mg gummies haha.

I myself have not yet made a tincture in the MBM nor have I reduced it to make FECO/MBO so I can't speak on making gummies that way and have only made the coconut oil gummies so sorry I can't weigh in on making them with tincture!"
MagicalButter,fjuvyi0,t1_fjsc2u6,1583620803.0,"Haha thank you! I infused the coconut oil last night & yielded about 2 cups. I made a gummy recipe today but it yielded more than 150 gummies instead of the 30 I was expecting soooo I have no idea what that’ll mean for potency. 

My Everclear & 7.5g of decarbed bud are still in the freezer cause as you said, I needed to step back & try and enjoy it cause realizing I had 5x’s more than I anticipated sure frazzled me! hahaha"

I usually decarb in a Pyrex dish covered in foil, but not sure if I have a big enough one for this amount of bud. Guess we’ll see. 

Thank you!"
relationship_advice,fjp244i,t1_fjp0l8u,1583539984.0,"Again, I don’t think she’s promising he’ll stay home. I think what she’s saying is that if he doesn’t work they’ll keep a similar lifestyle to what they have now, but if he goes back to his old job, they’d be living nicely. I think her point of saying he wouldn’t even have to work, is mostly to highlight the significance in pay increase but not the actual intent.

I think it’s also important to note, she’s not happy with the current place they live & did like where they used to live, where the promotion is."
MagicalButter,fjoyqbh,t3_fbihq9,1583537721.0,"I've had mine for about 5 months now and plan on using it for the first time tonight. Definitely nervous, but glad to know I'm not the only one that sat on their MBM as an everyday smoker out of fear of fucking up!"
relationship_advice,fjovht9,t1_fjo1o1g,1583535653.0,"While I think you should take the promotion, what I really want is for you to put yourself first just once. If you decide not to take it, let it be because YOU decided that your current situation is better than the alternative and are genuinely ok with it and that is ok!!

However, if you pass this up when even a small part of you wants this, feels you earned it, and knowing it would change your life - you will not only resent him, but you will also resent yourself and may have a hard time forgiving yourself. Not only will you have to find a new job, anytime you struggle to pay a bill, can't give your kids extras, take vacation etc. you're going to think about the time a job you (seemingly) enjoyed offered you a double salary in a place you've lived and liked.

I don't want that for you OP. I am a notorious people pleaser as well so I absolutely understand how hard it is not to do it, but the truth is that anyone, including your husband, who gets upset with you for setting boundaries (in this case, you not giving into him & doing what is best for you and your kids) are only upset because they no longer get to benefit from your lack of boundaries (or self worth).

Those that love you want to support you and see you succeed, thrive and be happy. Your company obviously sees your worth enough so that they want to compensate you and have you nearby. I hope that your husband starts to see it as well.

Good luck with whatever you decide to do, just please also think about yourself in a situation of this magnitude."
relationship_advice,fjou9ts,t3_fef04y,1583534922.0,"So, I know this isn't ideal but maybe it's a short term solution, but what if you take the position and bring your daughter since it looks like you commented that she also wants to move back and leave your husband where he is with your son?

Try that on a trial basis that way everyone gets what they want and it gives you time to see how you like the promotion, and gives your husband time to realize how much the promotion also benefits his lifestyle. 

I know that probably sounds crazy to some people, \*gasp\* ""don't split the family up!!"" but in this day and age, and with your new salary, it's not like traveling and staying in touch would be an issue. 

Obviously a decision would have to be made eventually, but if you are truly much happier and he doesn't see that and want to support it - at that point it may be time to reconsider what you're getting out of this marriage."
relationship_advice,fjott6g,t1_fjokc0e,1583534672.0,"After reading all the comments from OP about how they lived there for 4 years before leaving and have only been gone a year, and that her husband has a job there that would hire him back immediately, I agree. She said he didn't really like it there so maybe he's holding on to that too, but with an opportunity for his wife to not only better her life and his, but their children's quality of life - it's hard to understand why he wouldn't want to support that."
relationship_advice,fjoteqy,t1_fjok5l2,1583534450.0,"I'm not OP and I keep replying to comments so forgive me for that, but I read a bunch of her comments so figured I'd fill in some info.

Since they lived there before, her husband actually has a job lined up because his old job begged him not to leave and would happily hire him back. They used to live there so they do have a support system (though it sounds like he's never really had many friends period) and the kids went to school there for 4 years up until a year ago when they moved to the place they are now (that OP isn't happy in)

Again, sorry for replying for OP. I don't know why I'm so invested in this. I think I just see so much of myself in her with the people pleasing."
relationship_advice,fjostjl,t1_fjojgiz,1583534129.0,"She is miserable where they are. She doesn't like it there but went for her husband. They previously lived in the location she was offered the promotion so it's not really as unknown as it normally would be. Her husband has a job that would take him back, their kids have friends, 

There might always be other jobs, but there wont always be jobs you enjoy offering to double your salary. 

I almost disagree on family being more important than a job, HOWEVER, I am fully aware that I am extremely biased on that statement because I don't really have family. So I suppose the statement that family is more important than a job is more subjective than my initial thought of ""wrong"" (that was my bias talking)"
relationship_advice,fjosf1u,t1_fjoj71i,1583533910.0,"Kids have friends there as they lived there before., Based on her comments the daughter wants to move back but the son doesn't."
relationship_advice,fjos5h1,t1_fjoipxn,1583533765.0,I think the difference here is that they previously lived in the location she was offered the promotion in for 4 years. They've only lived where they do now for the past year (and before the other place) so I don't think it'd really be much of an adjustment because they do have ties there and the kids have friends.
relationship_advice,fjoqwsb,t1_fjoi7vh,1583533087.0,"From comments I've read, she makes less than 75k, but close but with the promotion would make much more than that in the 6 figures. They also are not low income, but don't have savings and get help from his parents with school supplies, and her parents for extras and aren't able to take vacations or anything like that. She said after bills there is not much left over so this promotion would definitely change that.

I really hope she takes this promotion. Since they lived there before they all already are familiar with the area, daughter wants to go back, son does not, and husband has an old job that wants him back.

I really fear she'll never forgive herself for turning down an opportunity to improve her and her kids quality of life this much. Money isn't everything, but when you don't have to worry about it, it makes everyone happier."
relationship_advice,fjoqfw2,t1_fjonr25,1583532840.0,"I disagree. A lot of my chosen family was much better than my biological one, especially as a kid. Obviously, it doesnt sound like these kids have a tough life, just pointing out that absolute statements like ""nothing"" is incorrect and many have different life experience. 

As far as his career, they used to live where she was offered the promotion and has said that his old job begged him to stay and would hire him back in a heartbeat, so I don't think he has to worry much about that."
relationship_advice,fjom5si,t1_fjojkqw,1583530552.0,"I think she's saying that while her husband not working isn't the plan, if he was worried about finding a job or not wanting to work, she'd make enough that he wouldn't be forced to. 

It wouldn't leave them where they are now because it gives the husband the option to be a SAHD and they live comfortably, or he goes back to his old job that would like him back and they live like they have 3 salaries."
