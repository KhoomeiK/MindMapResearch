i watch a lot of anime and gameplays and once im interested in something i get really passionate about it so i find myself talking to whoever i can about it often. just last night i was telling my sister about this game i recently became interested in(smile for me) and just halfway through the conversation i got scared i was annoying her and just stopped talking all together. then theres the times when its a lot less irrational, my friend was over last weekend and i was telling her about this game but not even a minute later she plugged in earbuds as if we werent even talking 

i kinda went off on my own rant but i get how upsetting it is to be in situations like that"
