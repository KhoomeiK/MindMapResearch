mexico,fjs9y2g,t3_fek3q7,1583595050.0,"Mi hermana tiene que ir a revisión cada año ya que esta en remisión de cancer. Descubrimos que tenía cáncer a los 24 años y gracias al hospital de cancerología en menos de una semana ya estaba en tratamiento. 
Han pasado ya varios años pero tiene que regresar al hospital a un chequeo anual y sacar una resonancia magnética. Nunca tuvo problemas hasta que la 4T entró al poder.

Ahora las filas son más largas. La mandan a comprar el medio de contraste para tomar la resonancia. Este medio es carisimo y mi hermana no tiene mucho dinero para pagarlo. Además a la hora de la cita les informan de esto por lo que tiene que andar corriendo de farmacia en farmacia para ver si tienen el medio o no.

Siento una pena terrible en especial por aquellas personas que tienen cáncer en este momento. No puedo imaginar la impotencia que sienten."
AskReddit,fj3njvg,t1_fifed59,1582988681.0,"Well..some places of the house had a bad vibe. Like the kitchen. I could not do the dishes and turning my back completely because you felt as if someone was standing right behind you or it felt like, you know when someone is giving you a hateful stare?, it felt just like that.
The kitchen was right next or parallel to a hall which led to my parents bedroom and the living room so this hall also had a bad vibe and you could see a shadow of something like a kid hiding on the other end of the hall. We think this was just the optics of the house but I've never seen it again.
There were weird sounds at night like rumbling or thumping on the walls. We lived on a second floor though with no neighbors below, above or next to us.
Also this rumbling was not accompanied by any vibrations. It was just the sound and the feeling that this was not normal.

One night was specially scary. My parents had gone out to a party and left me and my sisters alone. The sound started louder than ever. Me and my sisters tried to ignore this as always but it got so bad we ran to my cousins house which was super close. My aunt came actually over to check the house but heard no sound, she did however felt super scared in there so she let us have a sleep over at her place.

This things among others would happen so often we just learned to live with it and me and my sister even named the ghosts. We moved out when I was around 12 and never felt like that in any other house since then again."

facepalm,ffjndgd,t3_etsmxb,1580002256.0,No. Only if you are going for surgery would the weight matter. What is wrong is that they keep doing BMI index which has been deemed as inappropriate. And from experience... Ive always been underweight and this BMI shit just gives most doctors tunnel vision. Being underweight does not make you unhealthy and then being over the BMI scale does not make you unhealthy either.
AskReddit,fb1dx6k,t1_faxq1p1,1576435514.0,"Im in the same boat. I have a family trip planned for next year and my brother in law has 4 kids. 4!!!! 

What makes it worse is the feeling of robbing my husband the chance to have a family. But, I have noticed now sooo many young woman are not having kids.

 Also society makes you believe that as a biological being you have to be born, grow up, reproduce and die! Which makes us feel worthless. But they can suck it! It is perfectly normal no not be able to reproduce and we should start changing this viewpoint.

 My two best friends (pretty successful career woman) are childless. My two sisters, my boss. It's a new era. We all will grow all without them so we won't be alone! It is what gives me hope."
AskReddit,fb1b1gr,t3_eauhhu,1576434331.0,"I cant have kids. I focused my life on getting an education, a job and stability in a relationship to finally have a planned family. A year ago we started trying to have a baby and 6 months after I was finally pregnant, however we had a misscarriage right after my birthday. 

I found out i have large fibroids which could cause me not to have kids ever. I didn't believe it at first but after our misscarriage I know I won't be able to carry a child. I am angry as even my husbands drunk friends are having surprise kids with one night stands and I (a responsible woman) will never do."
Haunted,fb192kd,t3_eatqvv,1576433625.0,"I grew up in a haunted house. I didn't think It was haunted until we had to move and never experienced weird things again. The kitchen a hall and a bathroom in the same section of the house were the most haunted places. I could not phantom doing the dishes with my back completely turned and washed them like on a weird side angle because I could feel a strong horrible stare in the back of my neck everytime I turned my back. Not only me, but my sisters felt the same thing.

In the hall we could see sometimes a kid hiding everytime we walked by but I try to explain this by the optics and set up of the house.

Finally sometimes at night the bathroom faucets would open or sound as if they were being opened and you could hear the water running. Doors would shut close and the walls sometimes we could hear pounding on the walls. Although we lived on a second floor with no neighbors on either side.

What we did was talk to the ghosts and told them to stay quiet whenever we felt scared. I don't think it worked but at least we felt safer by acknowledging their presence. 

 We think sometimes ghosts hide stuff like money or important stuff to them and sometimes they do want you to find it. I would say, dig more into it and you could set the ghosts free."
infertility,f8ejvqo,t3_dwv8pm,1574529082.0,"I feel you. I cannot pretend to be happy whenever someone makes an announcement like that. On top of that I have like 4 nieces on my husband's side who have birthday parties and Christmas concerts and the usual boring stuff that I cannot get myself into. In addition, his family keeps bugging us and asking when it will be us having kids. I'm honestly screaming the next time ""I am infertile please stop asking"". I'm sure that will stop the invites and questions and they might be more careful while speaking to us ""the infertiles"". Keep it up! We shouldn't give in to the social pressure of reproducing and need to focus on our own happiness."
