I thought it would  be nearly impossible for my depression to come back after taking such drastic measures but maybe this could be my depression coming back? I want to play my video games more because I love to play but I just can‚Äôt. Even when I do attempt, I just can‚Äôt hold focus, it just feels dull. Even new games that I was once excited about.

introvert,fmvmt26,t1_fmvg70k,1586422794.0,"Personally, I don‚Äôt really think that‚Äôs the case generally.  With introversion you enjoy socializing, you just get tired of it quickly and need time to recharge. You can feel fulfilled with the right amount of socialization. Whereas social anxiety you tend to avoid any social interaction. You can be an introvert without being afraid to order food or ask where the restroom is. You can be both or actually be extroverted with social anxiety."
