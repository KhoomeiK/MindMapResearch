askdrugs,fmiy0ja,t1_fmixgao,1586119189.0,Thank you so much I really appreciate you talking to me. Yeah I think that is a good idea when she just wakes up. Thank you again
askdrugs,fmiwseh,t1_fmiw4ag,1586118491.0,Different how? It’s gone now.. I think it was a momentary fuck up that it was kinda in the open inside a cabinet. I don’t want to get caught looking for it but it was pretty consistently fine and white but I remember that the pieces were pretty clear. Definitely not opaque. I would guess that it was a few grams. It was in a bag about as long as my finger like maybe 3 inches by 2 inches
askdrugs,fmiv30k,t1_fmiqnu8,1586117519.0,Idk I have bipolar so it’s hard to tell. I don’t think she’s spiking me but I have had some ups
askdrugs,fmipuil,t1_fmiopmw,1586114475.0,"I was wondering if it could have an anesthetic effect if she was snorting it and then I kissed her I guess. Like if it was still in her sinuses. She has nasal drip

No fever now. Only tylenol so far. I’ve been sick since the end of january. I’ve had a bunch of varying symptoms. Tested negative for mono and I had a swab for covid that was negative but that was like a month in. I definitely want to take care of myself first I just don’t want to piss her off"
askdrugs,fminpjj,t1_fming9i,1586113232.0,But she also doesn’t smell like alcohol sometimes she when her speech is slurred. Idk though my sense of smell is coming and going

I feel like you just want to dm because you know you’re being a hypocrite and don’t want it to be public.."
SmolBeanSnark,fm9wlr5,t1_fm78249,1585878217.0,How is it damaging if you don’t know whether or not she’s faking? Since you can’t diagnose her and all.. Also you called her a narc and that’s definitely a clinical diagnosis that’s still being used

TwinFlame,fit0ir3,t1_fisz9ey,1582699436.0,"It’s okay lol it was a safe assumption but no that’s not it. They just don’t really care. I called my dad while I was completely psychotic and saying some shit about the police and he just said he didn’t know what I was talking about. I kept thinking I was gonna get dragged to a mental hospital but no one cared I guess. I had to get myself to a hospital which is really impressive now that I think about it

So yeah they aren’t against it or anything.. they just don’t care"
TwinFlame,fissufl,t1_fisob98,1582692393.0,"I was kinda in a weird position when I posted this. I’m bipolar and I was having a pretty intense mixed episode coming on. I know from experience that my family won’t do anything if I go crazy and my friends don’t really know how to handle it even though I reach out to them.

It’s just a weird situation because my tf seems to be the only one who can actually tell when I start acting strange. I know it would affect them too if something happened to me so idk if they’d want me to ask for their help or not in an emergency situation. I managed to take some emergency meds and get to a doctor thank god. It’s just really hard to deal with a serious mental illness on your own because you can’t even rely on yourself :/"
BipolarReddit,fio53zf,t1_fio1ftl,1582576468.0,"That’s really good that you did that. Even if you can’t feel it maybe keep taking them? Until you can get something else at least. They will probably help with peripheral stuff too (sleep etc).

I get what you mean about the acute situations.. it’s just so hard to know when you start needing them without a lot of vigilance."
BipolarReddit,finx272,t1_finwswh,1582571911.0,Are you against antipsychotics? I know they are pretty rough to be on
BipolarReddit,finvnf1,t1_finufpr,1582571089.0,"They might just be worried. I’m guessing it was a benzodiazepine? They can make things a lot worse if you take too much for too long. The physical dependence sets on quick and the withdrawals can kill you. They are probably facing an ethical dilemma because they know that the way you are using them is dangerous. Did they offer you any other meds? I don’t think benzos stop psychosis 

I know the feeling of being let down by health professionals and I’m going through it right now tbh. I’m sorry this is happening to you. Unfortunately you need to be able to take care of yourself and get help wherever you can and fight for it. You are going to deal with plenty of problems with the healthcare system. ‘Letting the crazy flow’ isn’t going to punish them.. it’s just going to hurt you and the people around you. It really sucks but you are going to need to work because ultimately you are responsible for your health more than they are. You are strong and you can do this"
TwinFlame,filpne0,t1_filp7b2,1582507287.0,"Yeah I am. I’ve never felt the need to test anything tbh. Idk why but I don’t worry about that. 

I feel like there have been times where they’re like ‘I can’t believe you didn’t contact me’ when we were separated because it would’ve helped both of us.. even though they said they didn’t want to talk. I like to respect boundaries though so I don’t

It makes it really confusing."
TwinFlame,filox6q,t1_filnzsy,1582506779.0,"That makes sense completely. It’s held me off a lot.

anosmia,fikltl6,t1_fik82zb,1582482770.0,On the left side I can’t smell at all and I think that was from a tbi. Otherwise I have no idea but it’s been over a decade since I could smell
anosmia,fify9d9,t1_fifxvvl,1582394388.0,Zinc didn’t help me either lol. That’s awesome lemme know! I think it takes a few weeks usually
AskDrugNerds,fhtt7wx,t1_fhtrn9l,1581877889.0,That’s really strange. Did any dose of seroquel do that to your smell? I couldn’t smell when I was off it either so I wouldn’t have noticed a difference
AskDrugNerds,fhtsup4,t1_fhtqu43,1581877808.0,Hmm I wonder if it’s just because the vitamin d deficiency is causing some underlying depression that isn’t being treated with the antidepressants or if it’s actually changing them in some way
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fh8pxf8,t1_fh8l2ox,1581364936.0,Just make sure you don’t have anything important to do for awhile if you try it :p and thank you :)
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fh8khq9,t1_fh8gysy,1581361659.0,"That attitude is probably the most valuable one you can have in life :)

Yeah that’s exactly what it felt like.. like sometimes I knew that logically that I was in my house but it looked unfamiliar still. I also would forget about something’s existence if I wasn’t holding it. I had to keep a piece of paper with me all the time

It was a perfect storm of gaslighting, mental illness and a bunch of actual crazy shit happening at the same time. It’s a really long story but I was in a really abusive relationship with someone extremely intelligent and when I finally figured out what they were doing and ran away to my family’s house my parents announced they were getting divorced and my dad moved out. It lasted around 2 weeks of being super out of it

There’s a lot more to it but I think that some of us are also predisposed to dissociation because of our childhoods. I was probably more susceptible anyways. I don’t think you’d disappear but it might be a lot of work to come back. The longer you’re in it the worse it gets because it’s harder to find things familiar :/ everything in my life changed all at once so that was just bad luck"
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fh8fkns,t1_fh8eeea,1581358681.0,"I don’t hate that at all. I wasn’t disagreeing with you on that but I think there is a connotation of dream=not real rather than that all of it is equally real and in order to understand the subtleties of what you’re saying you need to be able to actually think. Maybe I’m biased because I’ve been in that situation but if someone said ‘everything is a dream’ when I was dissociated I would completely lose all my memories and forget who I am. I don’t think it’s sugar-coating or patronizing to let OP come back to reality first and make that decision for themselves. 

You’re absolutely right though that this is an internet forum and OP did come here for answers. I’m just offering another perspective I guess and saying that there are ways to word it that might save OP some trauma."
Glitch_in_the_Matrix,fh86fg6,t1_fh7nanh,1581353058.0,Dude I get what you’re saying but saying stuff like this can really fuck someone up when they’re feeling dissociated and make the suicidal ideation worse. I don’t think calling it a dream is fair exactly
AskDrugNerds,fgv90yz,t1_fgv7xkl,1581140912.0,Yeah I kinda didn’t expect there to be studies on it as an antihistamine specifically because it’s sorta dirty like that.. I doubt it would be useful to anyone except as a sleep aid. I will look more though
AskDrugNerds,fguv6k3,t1_fguu0zr,1581130146.0,Yeah I was actually more surprised because of the fact that it gets prescribed as a sleep-aid and I assumed it was due to being an antihistamine. I guess I thought that they knew they were taking advantage of that aspect of the drug. I can understand why they wouldn’t be able to know every drug intimately.
AskDrugNerds,fgutgbx,t1_fgut5b1,1581129047.0,I can’t decide if it’s hilarious or terrifying

Nootropics,fgdsqm2,t1_fgdq3lx,1580686480.0,I was thinking it was something more along those lines too.. I honestly eat everything that is supposed be bad for GERD and it’s never been an issue lol. And yeah I’ve heard they are bad for you but I haven’t looked into it much.. I’m hoping I don’t have to take them for too long. If it lasts another month I’m going to look into other ways of dealing with it because I don’t want to have to take a ppi
Nootropics,fgdn95b,t1_fgdmi72,1580684367.0,"That’s actually really good to know. I read a few case studies where women experienced their sense of smell coming back with vitamin d supplements to correct a deficiency but that’s all I could find. 

I brought it up with my doctor and they straight up told me they didn’t care and that it’s the least of my worries :/. I should probably find a new doctor tbh but I’m not sure I’ll ever be taken seriously due to my concomitant bipolar disorder"
Nootropics,fgdh7lz,t1_fgdfhb4,1580682408.0,Taking pantoprazole 40mg right now. It’s actually still a bit of an issue.. i have trouble swallowing sometimes so it’s kinda scary
Nootropics,fgdeiuo,t1_fgdcn2e,1580681651.0,"Not at all haha I agree they are probably causing some changes. At the very least I know it isn’t hypercalcemia though. I think the simplest explanation is that I may have had a vitamin deficiency (most likely d) that would have to be pretty severe if I basically lost my entire sense of smell and taste. 

I have other theories but for now I’m gonna stick to occam’s razor."
Nootropics,fgdanv2,t1_fgda2pb,1580680539.0,It’s vegetable glycerin and soybean oil
Nootropics,fgdag00,t1_fgd7yet,1580680469.0,Interesting.. I’d definitely try that just to test if it’s a direct reaction between my GI tract and the vitamin d or something secondary
Nootropics,fgda5wy,t1_fgd6fob,1580680370.0,I might do that but at the moment it seems like the actual vitamin d is the culprit. I’ve tried the d drops before though

Nootropics,fgd8y0z,t1_fgclspa,1580680109.0,"I will check what else was in them but I did actually take a few different types (with mag, with fish oil, and alone). I take a bunch of other stuff that is really hard on the stomach (e.g. lithium) but they never seem to bother me. Maybe it’s all catching up with me :p"
Nootropics,ffn25sp,t1_ffl8o3f,1580061167.0,"I wish you weren’t getting downvoted because there are so so many accounts of this happening. I don’t think it’s actually known what the mechanism for the seizures is but if anyone here is on lithium please look this up and ask psychedelic communities so you can evaluate for yourself.

Also there is still a lot unknown about everything that lithium does in the brain."

There is a lot of research behind them and the newer generation are a lot less nasty. Some still are but you have to try a few to get one with less side effects and you have to understand how they work. You know what could really mess someone up? Hurting themselves or others because they have no connection to reality. They should at least have the chance to come back to reality and make the choice themselves on how they feel about meds.

She is textbook psychotic dude."
spirituality,ffbnrjs,t3_esoi72,1579774652.0,"You really shouldn’t be helping her. Especially if you don’t understand psychosis. It can really dumb a person down regardless. Not saying she’s on the right drugs necessarily but it takes a long time for doctor’s to figure that out and lots of trial and error and med side effects. It doesn’t sound like you know a lot about her condition. 

You might perceive her as lifeless right now but assuming that is bad or something you need to fix is so arrogant. This might be a test for her to go through alone and grow. Even being ‘lifeless’ is a really shaping experience. Just because you don’t see anything from the outside doesn’t mean she’s stuck

Actually all of this is really arrogant. I know you mean well but it is way more complicated than you think. Just because you had an awakening doesn’t mean you know everything. There’s a lot of assumptions in this post and maybe you should be putting some energy into checking them. Psychosis is so much more complicated than you’re making it sound and I honestly think it would be really dangerous for you to try to help her. This is her journey

Off the top of my head he can probably get her name, locations she frequents, friends/bfs names and igs which probably show even more info about her and what she does, etc

But also he stayed on the train and mentioned how long she was traveling for. I’m guessing he noted where she got on/off if he was creepy enough to try to peep personal info on her phone.  Tbh I wouldn’t be surprised if he followed her since since I’m guessing he stayed on the train to see where she got off. Either that or they both coincidentally had long journeys that perfectly overlapped.

Just this idea that their ‘presence’ or whatever was the same as mine. I didn’t even know it was possible. 

It was weird too because I was struggling a lot with ptsd and it was almost like a break from my mind. Like I could see reality for a moment without that cloud over me. Which was interesting because I was pretty vulnerable at that moment and usually that would majorly trigger it."

I haven’t seen this mentioned but if she’s being abused.. getting her hair done might be one of the few things she’s allowed out for. Maybe her abuser would get suspicious and not allow it anymore if she changed hairstylists. It might’ve only been allowed this long because she’s been going to you so long. You also might be the only person who knows she’s in danger. I wonder if it’s possible to get a wellness check without her address.. like if you have her full name could the police find that out? I think this might be more than her trying to cope.. she might literally be fighting for her life. I’ve been there and it’s terrifying because if your attempt at getting away isn’t successful.. you’re so likely to die. Like most abuse deaths happen when the victim is trying to escape. Also, a lot of abusers can be super charismatic and manipulative and get out of trouble easily. Restraining orders don’t get enforced very well either. She has good reason to be scared of disclosing anything. Not your responsibility though and even if you do nothing but block her you are NTA.

I don't have access to the first or second one but a case study and a paper about thyroid problems secondary to lithium use aren't really helpful. The last one is interesting but all of the studies are about the extent of cognitive dysfunction.. not really the mechanism. I was just hoping that someone on here had looked into this because it's proving difficult to find. It's not like I didn't try googling it."

bipolar,ezx1sih,t3_d2rowd,1568230130.0,I actually did this. I didn’t tell anyone what the party was for but it was around christmas. I made everyone wear red and green so they’d assume it was a christmas party but when everyone was there I revealed a gigantic ‘I’M BIPOLAR’ sign. It was a pretty fun party actually. And yes I was getting manic

Nootropics,eul40ac,t1_eukwrje,1563896715.0,"Decreased need for sleep is a criterion for both. I find it really weird that he went that long without sleep and wasn’t exhibiting any really obvious signs of full-blown mania. Bipolar is super common so idk how a bunch of mental health professionals wouldn’t have noticed. It does happen though. I definitely wouldn’t rule out BP1 but I also wonder if there was a reason he didn’t get diagnosed. Seems like OP may have some severe anxiety at his baseline that complicates things.

Either way OP I hope you find out what’s going on. If you’re wondering about bipolar it sounds like there are a few of us on here who have it and can answer questions."

Nootropics,eueg3er,t1_euefg0y,1563743505.0,Like half a day? It was AOR and yeah it freaked me the fuck out so I didn’t touch it again
Nootropics,eue7kp4,t3_cg28zf,1563737361.0,Idk if this is of interest but I’m bipolar type 1 and bacopa triggered some hypomania. It was short-lived and could’ve been coincidence but it came on a few hours after I took it
