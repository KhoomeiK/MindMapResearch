I think I would like the way you are tuning your awd cars, is that kinda how the hoonicorn handles stock? It feels like a rwd sometimes, but still pulls nicely from the front when cornering really right and pulling out of drifts. I love that. 

So rwd isn't a detriment so long as I'm A class or under, in most instances. Okay, that's good cause I try to learn with lower class cars anyway.
