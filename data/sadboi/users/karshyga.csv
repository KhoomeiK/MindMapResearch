florida,fm2dhr0,t1_fm2bfj4,1585695306.0,"There's a number of different birds it could be with that kind of variety! With the wooded area, I would look for Carolina Wrens, Carolina Chickadees, Tufted Titmice, and Downy Woodpeckers. For the open space, House Finches, Eastern Bluebirds and Tree Swallows might take a liking to it. There's a small handful of other species it might be, but those would be the most common.

Grackles aren't cavity nesting species, but they are curious - sometimes too curious, and they can be aggressive towards other songbirds. Another aggressive species to look out for is the House (or English) Sparrow. They're a non-native invasive species, and some people will remove their nests to keep a space open for native birds, but that choice is entirely up to you. Watching any birds build a nest and raise their young is great fun. 

I'm going to keep my fingers crossed for Carolina Chickadees, because they're super feisty and adorable, and you're far enough north in Florida to have them around. 

Cornell Lab of Ornithology has an excellent website,  [All About Birds](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/) , that can answer just about any question on different bird species we have in North America.

Not food related, but there's a squeaky pumpkin that both of them will incubate diligently every spring. Maybe Cinderella will hatch this year, but it hasn't happened yet. And boy oh boy do they love shoes. Any time I have to retire an old pair of shoes or boots, they go straight to the black vultures.
