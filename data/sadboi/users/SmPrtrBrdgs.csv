MentalHealthUK,foubo88,t3_g9fr6y,1588080868.0,"People with mental illnesses do not have a 'look'. Part of my illness is anxiety surrounding my appearance, so I always shower, groom, style, pluck, tan, moisturise, apply concealer, clean my clothes and exercise relentlessly. Am I fine? Of course bloody not, but I noticed a doctor had written 'well groomed' in my file, as if everything must be ok. It seriously infuriates me. How can I have faith in healthcare professionals if they are this short-sighted? I suspect it is merely another blunt instrument to lower referrals and cut budgets."

mentalhealth,flma02t,t1_flls9in,1585278139.0,I didn't get mine till 24...and then never got behind the wheel again because I lost my job and it's too expensive. 38 and never had a car. Doubt I would remember how to drive anymore.
mentalhealth,flm9gd3,t1_fllswei,1585277756.0,"38 and I'm still in my childhood bedroom. Actually the bedroom first belonged to my brother who took his own life at 16 when I was 11, which is kinda fucked up when I think about it. I don't know why I'm still here, just treading water since leaving uni. I can't see my life ever changing, except getting much, much  worse when my dad dies, which is likely pretty soon with this virus knocking about."

depression,fi3fu5s,t1_fi1ivac,1582116629.0,"Yeah, I've done a little outdoor work, and as long as there's some definite goal to focus on and achieve, I find it far more enjoyable with the fresh air and exercise. It's like, if you build a fence, you see the completed fence and think, ""Nice, I built a fence."" There's a sense of satisfaction, unlike these bullshit Sisyphus office jobs where there's no end to the in-tray. 

Don't worry about 'one upping' btw, everyone will be different and somebody is always worse off. I've had a tough time but I'm also quite lucky in a lot of ways. My biggest anxiety is that 'luck' running out tbh."
depression,fi12mqy,t1_fi0htup,1582049399.0,"Managing for fourteen months is impressive to me. I got a degree, landed the 'dream' job and was out of there in six. I've never actually held a job longer than that because after what I call the honeymoon period of landing the job and settling in, the same thoughts you mention begin to creep in, the existential dread, and it's all downhill from there. It's a case of permanent exhaustion, anxiety, misery, boredom, irritability, bullying from co-workers, and an inability to concentrate on anything. Eventually I won't be able to sleep due to worry and the deficit builds and builds till everything goes bang.

I've tried the fitness route too. I still gym three times a week. The positive effects have really diminished over the years, I used to strut out of there feeling great, albeit temporarily, but now I leave feeling sad and exhausted. I keep it up because without it I'd feel like I had 100% lost the battle."
unitedkingdom,fhg318v,t1_fhfzx1b,1581557430.0,Years ago I was sent to work in a charity shop. Turned out it was already full of unemployed young people and there was barely anything to do other than sit in the upstairs kitchen all day. Mindnumbing. I didn't return after the first day and took a sanction on the chin. It took months for the news I had quit to filter back to them.
depression,ffzn0t4,t1_ffz65jp,1580386543.0,"Even if you were a monster I don't imagine treating you like that would help much, it would just build resentment, fear and anxiety which would lead to further issues. What do I know though, eh? :/

Thanks friend, good luck also! There's a lot of stigma around staying at home, especially in the US with the 'basement dweller' stereotype which has been around forever, but things are so much harder than they used to be, especially if you find it difficult to find/keep work and pair up with a partner or find housemates to share costs."
depression,ffyd2lk,t3_evsoai,1580343537.0,"Good to know it's not just me with the constant tiredness and sleeping. I can't stay awake at all lately. We are literally battling our own bodies. I saw my doctor today and he was so utterly dismissive, giving me the 'sleep hygiene' lecture I've heard a thousand times. If it was as easy as choosing to go to sleep at the appropriate time I'd have sorted it twenty years ago??

My dad gave up caring a long time ago. I remember overhearing him on the phone once telling someone the reason I hadn't left home was because I was 'too comfortable', implying that I had it good. Things could be worse of course, and I'm sure they will be when he dies, but living here as an adult without complete independence and privacy is shameful and an absolute misery."
depression,ffth69q,t1_ffsdqiu,1580220424.0,"I'm 37 too and in a similar situation, minus the welfare and apartment, and being a student wasn't much fun either because depression/anxiety had already kicked in. Apart from uni, I've never had my own place, I've been stuck living with my elderly father who barely speaks to me. He scares people away so nobody visits the house. All my old friends moved town or country, nobody with any potential stays here, there's only pensioners in my neighbourhood. On the rare occasion I do meet up with an old school friend, I imagine he pities me. I've been living a frugal, barebones existence on some cash I inherited from my grandma, but that'll run out before long. I'm trying to secure some basic welfare but there's zero chance my application will be successful. Not much else I can do though, I'll just have to appeal (another five or so months). I've not worked in 14 years and I've made over 500 applications in the past for min wage jobs and heard nothing back. At this point I'm resigned to a shit life that will only get worse once my dad dies, which can't be too far away."
