depression,ew2jrqa,t3_cmcier,1565048468.0,"I called out last Thursday via email, because I felt awful. I have called out in the past and I was punished for it by losing hours. I deleted my email app and am assuming I'm still needed tomorrow. I know he thinks I'm irresponsible, as does my family. No one seems to care."
JUSTNOMIL,eu89uz2,t1_epjqa9e,1563552779.0,"Sorry for the late reply, but the last time this happened, I counted and it was 22 questions in 20 mins!"
JUSTNOFAMILY,eu88cca,t1_eu85zfx,1563551851.0,"Ding ding 100% on my parents. Thank you so much for the detailed reply. For some background, my brother was diagnosed in his late teens - I was still a kid (7 years apart) and since then, life has revolved around him. It wasn't too bad though -- him and I were super close and even though it hurt, I tried to understand that sometimes we couldn't do things because of him. Despite his illness, he was still clear headed and coherant.

This all changed ages ago. I was graduating undergrad, and he was babbling to me about getting my phone checked because people could be listening into it. Long story short, he had stopped taking his medication and had to be hospitalized twice. He hasn't been hospitalized in almost ten years but since them, my parents have catered to his every move. It seems like his mind regressed. He no longer could speak articullary, and pretty much was a kid in an adult's body.

Since he stopped taking his pills, no regular medication worked so he was given the ""last resort pill"" which has a ton of side effects. He's had a kidney removed, his liver is shot, and a bunch of other ailments. I don't know if he's jealous of me, but perhaps he is. He plays the ""sick"" role but I know my brother is a smart man -- shown by him cursing at me for calling him out. He and my mom always say how he doesn't have a girlfriend -- I have been with FDH for almost eight years, have a Master's Degree, and am a professional. FDH is the same age as my brother, and is an attorney.

You've given me a lot to think about. I would love to get your feedback based on my information. I am def going to look into therapy. Thank you so much again :)"
JUSTNOFAMILY,eu84k2m,t1_eu840qw,1563549561.0,"I don't think my family is jealous - I know my mom is that he's sick and I'm ""normal."" I'm already ready for the tears and cries of abandoment. My BF and I are contemplating applying to teaching abroad in Japan which would be amazing.

The one my heart aches for is my dad. He used to put his foot down, but he is so browbeaten by my mom and brother that he just gives in now. He's also 80 years old and not in the mood for conflict. He's my only ally and the person I love most in my life. Had it not been for him, I would have bailed on my mom and brother ages ago."
JUSTNOFAMILY,eu8277z,t1_eu80hac,1563548129.0,"He literally does nothing on his own. Nothing. It may have been a low blow and said in anger, but he provides nothing. If someone is in the restroom and ""he can't hold it"" he pees in a bucket that my mom cleans out for him. He doesn't even know what medication he takes! 

Thanks for those kind words. I have my own issues, but I hope I can make a good life for myself :)"
JUSTNOFAMILY,eu81gmi,t1_eu80n62,1563547677.0,"Yes - when my boyfriend is home it's just him and us in our room/world. I doubt any more blowups will happen (I mentioned in a previous response that my brother and I are essentially VVVVVVVVVLC and have been for years which has kept the peace - just hellos and whatnot. This blowup only happened because of the router, since it made us interact with him. My poor BF regrets ever ordering the damn thing.)"
JUSTNOFAMILY,eu806nc,t1_eu7zmt4,1563546898.0,I wish my parents were like you. Yesterday was a huge eye opener for me. I truly think my parents expect BF and I to pretty much take the same roles they have. That's impossible since we both work and I refuse to be a slave to my brother.
JUSTNOFAMILY,eu7zjva,t1_eu741ef,1563546504.0,"This conversation will happen at the end of the year when BF and I move out. As much as it sucks, we need to stay here until the end of the year and not rock the boat."
JUSTNOFAMILY,eu7zdd5,t1_eu70ky8,1563546391.0,"Wow, thanks so much for the advice! I know that my parents never want me to move out. I have been VVVVVVVLC/essentially NC with my brother for years even though we live together - I only got into his warpath yesterday because the router had him interact with us. All interactions are between him and my parents. My BF and brother pretty much just say hello to each other. 

I just feel so lonely. I used to be very close with my brother ages ago, and as the years have gone by, he has essentially turned his illness into an excuse for being selfish"
JUSTNOFAMILY,eu6ik24,t1_eu6fpd6,1563501111.0,"The red flags are terrifying. He calls my mom ""mommy"" and she sets out his clothes for me. My BF and I have talked about maybe setting up a will/future for my brothers, and they all live in their la-la land that this will be like this forever."
JUSTNOFAMILY,eu6by5k,t1_eu63fgt,1563496778.0,"End of the year, for sure"
JUSTNOFAMILY,eu6bx4c,t1_eu64qsl,1563496760.0,"Update: BF and I decided to return the router. I called my mom on the way to dinner (to not deal with them directly) and told her to tell GCB to pack it up. 

Apparently according to my mom, GCB ""became sad and asked if he could keep it."" One would think after that obsessive display, cursing, and acting like a big baby, my parents wouldn't give in.

Of course not! (Keep in mind he is in his THIRTIES) My mom says she'll pay for it because he wants it for his games. Apparently my dad agrees with them and the damn router stays.

I never realized what a selfish ass my brother is. He milks it because he knows my parents will ALWAYS give him what he wants because God Forbid he is ""upset"" and has an episode. 

Well, if they want to pay for it and give him that entitlement, whatever /s"
JUSTNOFAMILY,eu6auin,t1_eu68874,1563496062.0,"Oh, I know what they expect my fate to be. I refuse though. We're shipping him off to a home. I wish my parents would be a bit brighter and realize that when they pass, all that's left is BF and I..."
JUSTNOMIL,eqbrj0x,t1_eqbr7hm,1559954672.0,"Wow what a great response! This is actually both scenarios for her. She loves recieving credit for doing things and loves to show that ""she's just a good person."" SO's underwear got in with the family laundry and her comment was, ""SO's Hanes got into the wash - they were a bright blue color? I just folded them and put then in the drawer."""

JUSTNOMIL,eqbmld5,t1_eqb12ht,1559951350.0,"Yeah we are not close at all. Sometimes she'll pull the pouty ""Do you love me"" card since I rarely want to interact with her. She said she'll cry and will refuse to let me leave when I move out. 

Ewww I just thought of my FJNMIL buying me underwear and dry heaved.

Thanks for the advice!"
JUSTNOMIL,eqblq4i,t1_eqauhty,1559951047.0,"That's something I hadn't thought about. She grew up the oldest of 4 in a third world country - they didn't have a toliet. She has made some comments about seeing SO in his boxers and how ""tight/close fitting"" they are which makes me want to gag."
