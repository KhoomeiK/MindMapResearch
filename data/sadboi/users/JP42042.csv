conspiracy,fr4aiv9,t1_fr49mc1,1589881700.0,"Absolutely, I think that the trouble here is that ultimately it is human beings who made the discoveries and at the time very flawed. There was a lot of pride, jealousy, bandwagon, hype, and money involved in the scientific community, especially in that time. I mean, colonialism wasnt pretty and these were the same people that though certain races were superior and that was based on the evidence that because they had the more advanced technology they were superior. 

Human beings are flawed and the article picked that up very well. Scinece needs to come from humility and a place of wanting to understand how the world works. Thats what a lot of scientists were missing and people in general too. We don't know a lot, as a scientific community, it is not all knowing. Some things we do know, others we are trying to figure out, and other things we will never know. Like what color was a T-Rex? We will never know, but we do our best to provide a stunning image to a child about the ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex that once, a looong looong time ago, in the very land we now walk, it roamed as king and shook the ground as it walked, like a chicken it might seem. 

Scientist do what they can but they still need to feed their families and pay them college debts, so thats where money gets involved and the greed/fame kicks in. And well, you know the rest. 

It was entertaining to read though lol, lots of bickering and inconsistencies. They're like children. We all are in a way."

conspiracy,fr4936n,t3_gml1xz,1589880214.0,"Well, I mean, they did though. Geologist major, have excavated, seen the dinosaurs, not sure who would go through all that trouble to bury hundreds of fossils everywhere all over the world through layers of undisturbed sediment. Its like forensic evidence, and there is evidence. Like lots.

But I do like how there's a conspiracy for everything, which should kind of make sense. Conspiracies are a questioning of what we're told, especially if they match our own experiences in life. Such as, never seen a dinosaur, they might not have existed. 

It also is very difficult and extrememly boring reading published scientific articles and by the time it gets to the avg person, its passed through 3-4 sources. So one would have to read the articles themselves and have the scientific knowledge and background to truly understand them and possibly test theor theory without equipment as well. So, do we trust the scientists (who are also people and are surprisingly very petty at times) or do we mistrust what we hear. 

If thats the case though, why trust conspiracy theories in the first place and take them as evidence?

I don't know. Rock are kinda my thing and that means dinosaurs are too."

MensRights,fmff8fu,t1_fmfe1x3,1586026001.0,"Nah man, feminism is about equal rights for human beings. To be feminist is to believe women have equal rights to men because of our shared humanity and is indiscriminate against race because all races have women in them. Its all encompassing and to say feminism is about putting men down is to feel threatened about the change in power. Its like saying there's no racism in America and everyone is equal. Under the law, yes, but its men that make the law and enforce it. Look at cops, at school districts, at the war on drugs that still isnt being addressed or corrected. For women to be considered truly equal is for everyone to be considered truly equal and therefore women are the last to get such rights. 

To be clear, exploiting, manipulating, abusing, oppressing anyone regardless of race, gender, religion, socioeconomic status, intelligence, abilities, is wrong no matter towards who and no matter where it comes from. 

So yes, you can support both men and womens rights because they are all one and the same."

photocritique,fmd6haj,t1_fmd52pw,1585960391.0,"So your third one, that looks like sand dunes or a seductive lady is incredibly good. No changes there. Its intriguing, draws you in, has you guessing, clear subject even if the subject itself is a mystery. 

The first and second look nice at first glance, but but after the fire appeal is over, there doesnt seem much else than a picture of fire. I think for these a different angle wpuld be best. I like how the first one has fire and the embers, but its at a 3d angle which implies youre going to see more. Id sugest a 2d view, where you are eye level and all you see is the profile of the fire and ember, like a mountain. 

The second one with the cinder blocks looks a little disorganized. I magine it was a genuine photograph, but if that was the case, there needs to be more clues that add to it being a genuine shot. If not, perhaps a better angle where the blocks are more geometrical and maybe at a lower angle so that the foreground and background both are made of blocks, or a church like photo with the blocks being the guiding lines.

The last photo that is all bokeh needs a subject. If all bokeh like abstract art, then more fire in the backgroind or more black. However, I think you just need to tweak your approach a bit more. You got a good eye obviously and good image in your head before hand, so now it's trial and error. You know theres something missing so its about experimenting until you get the story you are after. 

Awesome subject, fire is really something awesome and you're gonna take awesome pics."

It's a gate opener is all it is, but if instead you learn to pick the lock, it'll cost less than buying the key, but you open the gate regardless. So learn, do your own work, freelancing and networking into whatever it is you are desiring, and then have proof of work experience when trying to land other jobs (if this is what you're after). 

Like people are saying, a degree is just proof, and by using universities, you are kind of forced to pay for that proof and in that respect, they are gatekeeping information that hold a higher living wage. So even if you did learn the knowledge, there's ""no proof"" and so the system is rigged.

You can bypass it, but if you have the ability to land a job without a degree, you should probably focus your efforts on entrepreneurship instead of learning on your own to work for someone else."
