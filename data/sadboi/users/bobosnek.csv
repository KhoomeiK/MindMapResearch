Psychonaut,foq99c2,t1_fopacpa,1587987370.0,"1. I went into a psychiatric center for a while and my parents figured out that it was because I used LSD.  I asked my mom if she told my brother, she said that he said he's very worried about me. My brother called me from honduras a few months after that. I told him I got psychosis from LSD. I also mentioned that I got fired from my job for smoking pcp in the front. He said so because of psychosis or whatever the fuck, you can't even tell if a drug you use has benefited you or not, and I said yeah in a tone that showed agreement. I was surprised that he had that outlook on drugs. I then felt something in my mind change suddenly, I started feeling what I was already in my mind but slightly more, and a faint feeling that I wasn't the only one experiencing what I was feeling at the time, I felt fainlty aware that the source was the person I was talking to.

 I felt as if I was deep under a dark ocean with a spiky blowfish. Then it went away, and he said ""you're in a rut right now brother"", *you* should be doing whatever *you* can to improve *your* current position."" I said yeah two times in agreement, I then faintly heard the words ""I'm worried he's not able to do it"", But he never actually said that. Then he asked  ""so what else is going on."" He changed the topic because he was uncomfortable worrying about me or something related about what I heard him think previously. We talked about a different topic and came back to a similar one, he said that I need to improve, drugs or no drugs, that's my business. 

2. During my actual trip with some friends, I started talking about the fact that my brother said that I'm gonna fuck up my brain by taking LSD and that I'll be cut off from the family if I take it. My friend said to just not tell him, I had my mouth open for a second, then it felt as if I thought the words ""I already told him"" which I never did, as soon as I ""thought"" this my friend made a sad face as if he felt bad. I realized that it seemed like I was about to say what it felt like I thought, but I never told my brother so I must've almost heard or thought his thought of that as he thought it, somehow idk lol."
Psychonaut,fop08bg,t1_fmnhmlk,1587950220.0,"They were taking your creativity and personality away, like for me I feel like sometimes I can see multiple outcomes of each situation and think hard about what to choose pretty easily, I have this childlike happiness, I can see the best way to do things. I'd feel extremely smart. Especially while high on some good weed, only problem is that parts of my body twitch along with what I think and hear and see and feel sometimes. Now why would I want to sedate any of that?

 LSD and weed doesn't make one smart on their own, it's just easier for them to make themselves smart. I don't even use LSD anymore. I've seen that there are profound actual benefits to these symptoms similar to psychosis from LSD. I've figured that psychosis comes from parts of the subconscious mind, it's deeper parts are truly one with the universe, which is why they have delusions because in those parts, everything is everything. It also seems as if I notice when telepathy does and doesn't happen, I'm never completely sure 99% of the time, but it happens and how it seems is scary cuz I had a bad trip.  some things are just too coincidental to be coincidences my friend. I can explain a few circumstances involved in telepathy if you like I just don't want this to be too long. 

 I don't believe things just from the fact that it feels like I believe them, or because it seems plausible, but because of the use of ""proper"" analysisI've seen done by others, it's a great tool for anything. While pretty high one weed I'd feel as if I am literally nothing, yet my ""horizon"" or something is infinite, spreading across the entire universe.

I'm not gonna find any peer reviewed study on being stuck in a trip to your own subconscious but there's decent reason for suspicion to the theory that you can. Its been proven that LSD permanently alters brain chemistry, in a quite a few places to the point where it leaves me thinking twice about if that's normal or not despite the benefits. Just pay close attention to how people in general are affected by LSD short term and long term, and research any way you see fit on permanent changes in the brain from LSD. Pay attention to their behavior, habits personality, thinking before and after too, just some advice if you care to see the truth for yourself. People who are more knowledgeable about LSD are more likely to say that yes LSD does fuck up the brain very hard. Anyone trying to deny that is only trying to back up the benefits and shit. Have you ever even seen images of a brain scan of someone on LSD? I'd imagine it would be tricky to get the brain chemistry back to how it was before. That just doesn't look right to me lol but you would just think of the benefits and shit from it, which I understand, as long as mental health is in check I don't see a problem lol I'm sorry if I sound like a smart ass."
