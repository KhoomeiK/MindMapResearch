CAStateWorkers,fquezt1,t1_fqudz3a,1589657736.0,"I worked with a former EDD employee and at his retirement party last August, he was mentioning that when the state had furloughs in 2008, his department didn't have them because they're federally funded. I can imagine that furloughing EDD employees would have a huge impact anyway since they need workers to process all those UI claims and have support staff to keep the ball rolling.

Why anyone should voluntarily take a pay cut to stand in solidarity with the rest of the state is a noble gesture, but to me it doesn't make sense. Those departments will suffer backlog of work and in the end it'll just add more suffering."
CAStateWorkers,fqucyqp,t3_gklb1z,1589656573.0,"OP I'm in the EXACT same position as you. I worked hard past year to get a promotion and it looks like that won't be happening. With that being said, I heard EDD, DOJ, DMV, and DOT are immune to pay cuts and furloughs because they're federal funded. Can anyone confirm or dispute this?

If true, I'm going to start applying for promotions at DOJ (I worked there two years and I have a feeling I could easily get back in).

Only regret is that I grew to love my current job and the people I work with, and my work is challenging and I feel like it's been a great learning experience.
