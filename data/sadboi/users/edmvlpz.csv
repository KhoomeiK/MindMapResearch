Someone always catches feelings. I admit I don't like rejection, but this idea came to me when I broke up with my toxic ex. They're was a year when I didn't give a damn about sex or relationships. That hasn't happened to me since I was 13 (35 now). Life was SO comfortable, but when I got therapy and took shrooms, all those desires came back. That is why I theorized that it was unhealthy for me to not desire it. Now I'm wondering if there is a healthy way to get back there. I don't want to spend the rest of my life fighting or fulfilling that desire. I just want it gone like before."
