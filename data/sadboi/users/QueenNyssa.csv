Every person I've ever been interested in either ghosts me, says they like me but then won't commit to a relationship, or just use me for sex. Everyone around me is in love and dating and settling down and I'm forced to sit and watch them and hear all about how they're in love. I get told to love myself first, to focus on school, to stop looking because love will find me, but it's so easy for them to say because they already have someone to love them. I don't. It's definitely a confidence killer because all my failed relationships have one thing in common... And it's me. Like, I get that I'm not attractive whatsoever. But I'm a good person with a very big heart who would go to the ends of the earth and back for the people I love. Unfortunately, that's not enough. My heart just aches. I'm so incredibly lonely that I stay in toxic situations just to feel another human being's touch. Either I stay abused but get human interaction, or I end them and truly become alone. It's the worst kind of existence. I wish I had answers but I don't. Just know you are not alone."

rant,fcbg4bq,t3_egwxzj,1577586444.0,"I tried to end my life when I was 18, after years of depression and an assault.

I'm 26 now.

It gets better. Not completely. Not overnight. Not on its own. It takes time and effort and belief in a future that is better, no matter how much your brain wants to tell you it doesn't exist.

I still struggle daily with suicidal thoughts. But they're less intense than they were all those years ago. I still struggle with self harm thoughts. But they're less intense too.

My advice is to seek help. Therapy has helped immensely. Medicines less so but I'm better on them than off. People fucking suck and at the end of the day, you are all you have. Friends, romantic partners, even family come and go. You are all that you have. You've got to fight for yourself. Find a reason to be. Even if it's just pure spite, to prove everyone who doubted you wrong. Even if it's just the next season of your favorite show. Even if it's just so that your pet doesn't have to mourn your loss. Any reason that keeps you alive is neither stupid nor meaningless.

Sit for a moment and think about if you felt better... What would you want to do with your life? What do you want to do for a career? Help others? Make lots of money? Something technical? Business related? People oriented? Whatever that is, start working toward it. Take baby steps, even tho they will be terrifying.

Realize that EVERYTHING CHANGES. Even one year can make a hell of a difference. A better future is out there, and you deserve to experience it. It may seem unattainable, but it isn't, not if you're willing to do whatever it takes.

I know you don't know me but I believe in you. I am proud of you for making it through this shitfest of a year and I have faith in you that you'll make it through. <3"

Knowing I'm better protected against pregnancy is a huge comfort, especially because I do not want children and I am not in a position to raise kids at the moment. The spotting is annoying but so worth it compared to getting pregnant Lmao. Sex feels better to me without a condom so I like not having to use one. I'm hoping that this spotting business will clear up eventually. If it doesn't by the time I have to go for my next pap smear, I'll talk to my gyno when she does it, to see if there's anything that can be done about it. If not, I'll live with it.

sex,f6wvwnx,t1_f6wv80w,1573236077.0,"Sure! I've had Paragard since June of this year, so... 5 months. I haven't had a full fledged period yet. Instead, I spot for two weeks, then nothing for two weeks, then spot again for two weeks. It's been like that since the Paragard insertion, which is annoying, but it's manageable. It's light enough that I use maybe 4 or 5 regular tampons over the course of the two weeks spotting, and that's only when I have class or times when I worry that I might spot too heavily and bleed on my panties. Other than that, I don't even need pads. There's no cramping for me but everyone is different.

No issues with sex at all!! I've had unprotected sex with someone I trust and he's finished in me plenty of times and I'm not pregnant, so I'd say it's working. He hasn't accidentally hit the string ends either, so my gyno did a good job cutting them at a good length. 

All in all, I'm glad I got it. It's good for ten years and I cannot feel it at all. It's working and my insurance covered it. And since I can't be on the pill or any other hormonal birth control, I'm really glad Paragard exists."

And it's not even restricted to cutting. Burning yourself is self harm. Slapping, punching, biting, etc. Are all self harm when done for the purpose of hurting yourself. Even things that don't cause physical pain or wounds can be self harm. Things like alienating yourself from friends and family. Things like drug use or risky, unprotected sex with strangers. Things like binge drinking or eating disorders. If it is harming you, and done with conscious intent, it's self harm imo.

Live for the seemingly small things. For me, it's cold weather, which I love more than anything. For the possibility of seeing snow again someday. Live for the next episode of your favorite show. Live for that new album your favorite band is working on. Live for being able to pet an animal again, to feel it's soft fur between your fingers. Live for the quiet peaceful moment just before the sun breaks the horizon and brings a new day. Live for the seemingly small things but know that nothing that keeps you alive is small or pointless. 

Keep living to prove the world wrong, to prove that you were better than they could have ever imagined. Live because you have worth and value even if no one around you can recognize it. Living is the hardest thing to do sometimes. Take it from someone who's failed to end it before. I regret failing sometimes but other days I remind myself of those ""little"" things to live for and I put in the effort to change my circumstances, even tho all I want to do is sleep or die. I go to therapy. I go to school. I go through the motions. I do it because I have to believe that it won't always be like this. It *cant* always be like this. I was happy once, even if it was a decade ago. I felt happiness once and I will feel it again, but only if I continue living. The same goes for you."
