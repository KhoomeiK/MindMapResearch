Drugs,fnfqt39,t3_g13ina,1586913538.0,"I had a similar experience recently. I had attempted suicide years prior though i never came close enough to actually doing it but still got caught. This time i didnt outright try and commit suicide, it was more of a long episode of self medication. It eventually lead up to my first semester of college where i was doing large doses of a benzo called klonopin and mixing it with alcohol regularly. 

And i came close to overdoses many times over that period of months. It was slower but not as traumatic as yours, this kind of overdose is where you black out and never wake up again. This may sound very nice but my friends were getting worried about me and i felt more like a burden than ever. I was transforming into a walking corpse who was becoming weaker every day.

Eventually i saw death for what it really is. Not a repease from the struggles of life. But a complete shutting down of everything eternally. I would only survive as a memory in others minds until that memory too would dissolve and fade away like a drop of water in the ocean. Its very beautiful actually how we come into this world and build ourselves into what we are until we all inevitably break apart into our basic elements and our form vanishes from existence.

This sounds cheesy as fuck but ive never felt suicidal since. And i for once in a life time understand why life is a gift. And i also for once understand how powerful death truly is. All the subtle things in life i love, in my eyes, only exist while im alive. And i should only die when im ready to lose all those things. Depression doesnt ever really go away, but even though it hurts sometimes it also allows us to respect the beauty of the world. I hope you are feeling better and find some amount of joy in life :)"
replications,fn95qck,t1_fn8xonv,1586760344.0,Thats really weird the same thing with heart palpitations and arm numbness happened to me. But it was induced by benzo withdrawal. Panic attacks and muscle spasms are a common symptom of that and if i had done benzos for longer the withdrawals couldve caused siezures.

So it is not necessarily schizophrenia or any permanent disorder like that. When i get depersonalization its usually during a panic attack of sorts. So you may have had a bad panic attack on weed and developed some sort of panic disorder that caused you to become depersonalized. Usually the best way to deal with it is to try and calm yourself down and recognize your not going insane and after a little bit you should feel more with reality.

depression,fkwp154,t3_fl4ylz,1584599913.0,"Its difficult when things fall apart. This year has been a shitshow. Last semester i got into a deep benzodiazepine and alcohol binge. It was very dark. I spent months basically unconscious, wandering around like a zombie, and never remembering any of it. And this was near the end of a two year acid binge. My life was a beautiful but disorienting blur and i was living life moment by moment, losing a lot things and people along the path.

Its obvious now to me that i was in a subsconscious episode of self destruction, with the motive of stopping my life in its tracks. And i succeeded (almost) as my heart stopped and i almost died. When i learned about this there was a strange snap in my brain. Of course im still depressed but my point of view has been changed drastically. Death does not seem like an option.

The way i see it there are two options in any given scenario, you can perservere and in curiosity create and discover new things, or you can give up and destroy any possibility that could have existed. You can either be something or be nothing and that is up to you alone. Death is the ultimate destruction, it is the opposite of existence, that cold cold place that never moves. Life is a gift on this earth, it is where those warm comforting smiles and laughs come from even if they are far and few in between.

Either way, when death came to my doorstep it became obvious to me how much i value life. Value that i took entirely for granted. Honestly who gives two shits about society. Because society is made of individuals. And it is you the individual who can create what you seek in the world, because you want to learn your values and spread their word. We have a lot of power everywhere we are, so why are we here wasting it."

Me almosr dying was a bit of a reality check and has brought entirely new anxieties ive never had but thats my problem. You should do what you want but if your like me your parents probably pressured you go to college now. 

I think the first step to feeling better is finding what i actually want in life so that i can use my new adult freedom to persue that. I have friends who are not in college, instead they left to discover themselves in the real world. I think i might stop going to college. I want to be free. I want to live in a place with enough people i can go to a bar or whatever, start talking to a stranger and if it gets awkward leave and never see them again. Over time becoming better at that. And maybe the people who i connected with can teach me something about myself.

Ive trapped myself my entire life. And times running the fuck out so i better stop wasting my time taking GEs and actually start producing, creating, exploring this world. I think a large part of my depression comes from the fact that ive limited my view of the world to my own bubble of sadness. And i need into the world so it can screw me in the asshole enough times to bring me out of myself. Idk do whatever you want all im saying is maybe you need a change."

NDE,fjmqhnq,t3_fbf7x6,1583479521.0,"I am 19 M in college. Recently in the midst of a three month long benzo binge. I was at a kickback in portland took 4mg of klonopin and later some mushrooms. I drank a lot that night, looking back it was obvious to me i had a bit of a secret death wish i was in denial of. I was so out of it i could barely walk and my friend had to hold me up while i took a 5 min piss out the door.

The same friend told me that my heart had stopped for a little bit but came back probably as the drugs wore off. I dont remember any of it. It was very spooky for me to learn that i had almost died a month after it happened. It was a major changing point for my life. I inexplicably had an entire change of mindset and have never felt so peaceful. Its a strange feeling. I also cut down my drug use drastically.

It became obvious to me that i am only momentarily here. And that this is the most beautiful moment i could ever have. The other side no longer seems far away, it feels as though i am touching it all the time. I became very motivated to do the things i love and reach out to people, always on a personal level, so that i could see the real them. Things that used to bother me such as social pressure now seem unimportant. These realizations came over the next few months gradually but they are started by a sudden snap.

The weirdest thing about this is that i have no recollection of that date. The entire day is gone from my memory, probably due to the nature of the drugs. Studies have shown that even under complete unconsciousness, and anesthesia, memories of near death experiences are very vivid. But i had none, just peaceful darkness, and i was brought back to this strange chaotic dream that has never felt so real to me. 

I still align mainly with atheism, though i dont discredit other beliefs. This is mainly because i experienced nothing, and it wasnt bad. It is impossible for a human to know these things, and frankly i think its foolish for anyone to say they have the secrets. The universe is far to complex for any of us to really have a pinch of understanding. Really all that we can do is offer love to those who care about us so that both can experience the best moments. And spend our time creating things which make the lives of others better."

If you choose to od on molly right now you have allowed your demons to win. 

Also take a break from drugs, baby steps at a time. Chart that stuff out so you are aware how often your using and whether or not there is a trend towards sobriety. Find some non drug passions to distract you from them and focus on that. I recommend something creative as creating helps bring meaning to my life. 

For the longest time i was convinced i wanted to die. Then one day was very close to it. My heart stopped for a brief period in the midst of a benzo and alc binge, and if it continued i would certainly be dead. I cant explain it but ever since then i havent wanted to live more than i do now. 

It gave me perspective. I realized there are things i need to do before i die. And im afraid if you go through with this you will never find those things which will bring meaning to life. Death is no walk in the park, for you or anyone who cares about you, treat it for what it is. Good luck :)"

unpopularopinion,fi5l0o5,t3_f6am7x,1582165379.0,"But at the same time, men fall for that shit way too easy. We secretly like hoes because theyre hot but then flip around and dont respect that kind of behavior. You are the master of your own destiny, choose the girls who are real even if they arent hot. You cant blame women for your own lack of self control."
unpopularopinion,fhycl61,t3_f4zrxu,1581973179.0,"I am no psychologist so correct me if im wrong, but it reminds me of Maslows Hierarchy of needs. The first two base stages are physiological needs and safety needs, things which need money to buy. The rest are things you will not be able to buy. I think this should be rephrased as ""you dont need excessive amounts of money to be happy. You need to be able to survive and be secure, and the others will follow""."
unpopularopinion,fhondit,t3_f3rrnb,1581766140.0,"I live in humboldt CA a very small college town with some very dark sketchy shit going on. I have utmost empathy people who are addicted to drugs because i was in that situation not long ago, but there are some scary tweakers out here and a lot of them. There is a large underground drug industry here and the cops are not in control. 

At least 4 people just go missing every year and its well known that they were probably murdered. If you've ever seen the netflix series ""murder mountain"" you may be somewhat familiar with this but it is a lot deeper and larger than that.

Its an awesome place with a lot of great people also dont get me wrong. A certain amount of vigilance and paranoia is a necessity here. My friend who has lived here for awhile correctly described it as the wild west.

Sometimes i have to walk around at night to get a drunk friend or whatever. In these scenarios i fucking wish i had a weapon. I remember recently walking to my friends house i heard this dude screaming, cracked out probably, trying to break into a house less than 100 yards away. So hey clearly the people who shouldnt be getting guns are getting them anyway no matter what gun laws you have. Maybe thats not the solution but we cant keep trying to solve these problems with black and white solutions."

AskReddit,fh4u8hh,t3_f18upu,1581282182.0,Playing music keeps me going. Its one of those things that exists beyond my life and my problems. It brings me joy and calms me whenever i do it and so it allows me to do it more. Music in general is one of things a majority of people can relate to when it comes to bringing happiness so it makes me feel more connected to others.

edmproduction,fgk4g3n,t3_eyomcb,1580857273.0,"For me ive noticed that i often get lost in loops where i make music based on what i think the people will like. When i do this i dont finish projects, what i make is mediocre and most importantly i dont enjoy it. Technical stuff aside i can make much better music just by feeling it out and letting my mind loose when i create. This way what i make feels genuine and speaks from the heart."
LSD,fgjf8ew,t1_fgiyrbb,1580842789.0,I used to be like that. Then i became super analytical of my phones ui and crap when i look at it and it gave me great respect for the intuitiveness of this technology.
