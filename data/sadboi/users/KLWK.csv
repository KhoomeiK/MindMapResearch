I went through with him what to do if anyone else tried to touch his diaper area (tell Mommy and Daddy). As he got older, I told him if anyone else tried to make him touch the area their underwear covered, or showed him those areas, he should tell us, too. I told him sometimes people who do that lie and say they will hurt parents if kids tell, and that Daddy's cousin was a policeman, so no way someone would hurt us for that. (He was five during this conversation.)

At age four, he asked me how my sister-in-law's baby that was in her belly would come out. (He never asked how it got in there to begin with.) I told him the truth- that women have three holes- one for pee, one for poop, and one for babies to come out. 

At age six, he asked what my pads were for, and I explained that women have an organ called a uterus that holds babies inside their bellies while the babies grow, but if there is no baby, it comes out as a period, and it can be messy, so the pads keep things cleaner.  He asked if he would ever grow a baby, and I said no, boys don't have a uterus (I wasn't really up for explaining nuances with transgender individuals at this age), he said okay, and that was it.

When he was in fifth grade, they had Family Life Education at school. He hadn't asked any other reproduction questions up until that point, so it never occurred to me to go over the whole deal. The day I knew they'd had the first lesson, I picked him up after school, and he was very quiet. I asked him what he'd learned at school that day, a daily question from me. He hemmed and hawed, which is unusual for him, so I said, ""Okay, look, I know what you started to talk about in Health class today. It's how your body changes during puberty and how babies are made. It's weird information because it's new to you. But it's information everyone learns, because these changes happen to everyone. Do you have any questions about anything?"" He said no, but in subsequent weeks, after each of the five classes, he did ask me some questions for clarification purposes.

I guess...just be matter-of-fact. Use proper terminology. Acknowledge that it's an awkward conversation. Answer questions, but don't get too elaborate with answers, because that overwhelms kids who may not be ready for that level of detail."

StarWars,fqypz5d,t3_glju5g,1589752628.0,"Background info: I grew up seeing the OT in theaters. Darth Vader was absolutely the scariest villain onscreen when I was a kid. I saw the prequels in theaters when I was in my twenties.

AOTC to me is the weakest movie in the entire saga. The dialogue between Padme and Anakin is terrible. It's just not at all believable to me that a worldly former queen and current senator would fall in love with a whiny teenage boy five years younger than she is. 

ROTS was better, because the action was better. Still not great dialogue, mostly from Anakin, though. One of the things that bothered me was that, at the end of AOTC, Anakin was still a whiny teenager, but suddenly, at the beginning of ROTS, he's this jaded, experienced war hero. The transition was too abrupt, and there was nothing in the dialogue to indicate exactly how much time had passed- six months? A year? Five years? 

There was also way too little to indicate how Anakin became such a hero. A big thing with movies is show, don't tell, and I feel like we're told that, but we don't see a lot there to show that. And the dialogue between him and Padme is still extremely cheesy. I realize they're quite young, still, but I think it's denigrating to people in that age bracket to say that their dialogue was cheesy because they're young and it's their first love. 

I saw Hayden Christiansen in another movie not long after, and what that showed me was that, one, he's actually a really good actor, and, number two, there's only so much an actor can do when they're given shitty dialogue to work with. So, I don't blame the actors- there are some really top-notch actors in that series- but I do blame the man who wrote the script. 

None of them are terrible movies, but, to me, the prequels have a lot more that could have been done with them to make them great."

He first asked about him when he was about eight, and I'm a believer in answering questions at age-appropriate levels, and only answering the question that's been asked, so, at that time, I simply told him he was an alcoholic and his obsession with alcohol made him not a good father, which seemed to be enough at that time. 

As my son got older, he started asking more questions, and I expanded on the answers. We've discussed the DARE program his school ran, and why it's kind of dumb. We've traveled to states that have legalized marijuana use (that wasn't the goal of the trips, but we did see dispensaries, and have discussed potential health benefits of marijuana usage). He's seen us drink alcohol and not become violent or abusive and is growing up knowing that moderation is super important. 

As far as other drugs, I personally have never even smoked a joint, much less used coke or anything, which I've mentioned to him. He asked me why and I told him the truth- I didn't want to chance any legal troubles, because I was studying to become a teacher, and have worked in public schools since I was 22. It's not that I really wanted to use or anything, but it was my job and the knowledge that there's a very strong history of addiction in my father's family that made me especially leery of it all, and I've told him that is something he will need to keep in mind, too. 

I've told him I'm not an idiot- I work in a high school, and I know what kids do- but I really hope that he does not decide to try illegal drugs. I've also told him that if he's at a party and is drunk enough he an't drive home, or his driver is too drunk to rive, that he should call me and I will always come get him, no questions.

AmItheAsshole,fqupaff,t1_fque23m,1589662494.0,"Seriously, a couple of years ago, my neighbor across the street let his house totally go. He didn't mow the lawn at all, so everything was probably as high as my waist. He had trash in the backyard. He even had a freaking bush growing out of one gutter because, I guess, seeds got in there and the gutters were never cleaned. 

Did I got over and do anything to his property? No, I called the proper authorities, and kept calling, until the situation was dealt with. And now we have nice new people in there who have fixed up the whole house inside and out and are now working on repairing all the landscaping in the yard."

AmItheAsshole,fqte19h,t1_fqs0ezv,1589637068.0,"In addition to her physical needs (nice house, bigger yard, etc), the grandparents are very likely retired, and therefore will have more time and resources to attend to this child's emotional needs as well. A child in her situation has experienced a lot of upheaval, and could potentially be very emotionally needy for a long time. I don't see that kind of scenario ending well if she were to move in with OP and his wife.
