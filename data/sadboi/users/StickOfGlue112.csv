More than 100mg a day is pushing it as far as negative physical side effects go. Above that and your blood pressure will be pretty high, heart rate up, adrenal fatigue, heart arrhythmias, headaches etc. That being said as a ONCE off, you can take pretty large amounts of the stuff and as long as you don't go running a marathon or pulling a 1 rep max deadlift you should be right. By large amounts I mean like 150-250mg in a day. 

Going north of 250mg for multiple days in a row and you're sailing your boat right into an iceberg made of heart issues, strokes, wild panic attacks etc. 

If you must continue to abuse them, try to make it a once a week thing but definitely less than 3 days a week. If you go to far, substances like quetiapine will pretty quickly cut dopamine output and bring you down and if you don't have that there's always the ER.

My mother took me out of school due to bullying. I was pretty badly bullied so fair enough, decision made sense at the time. I was coming home with bruises, crying, depressed and miserable every day so I don't blame her for the choices she made. What I wish she had done however was teach me how to handle the situations I was put in. As all homeschooling me did was leave me with the same issues and put me back in high school with 15 year olds who continued to bully me for the same reasons only I'm older and more helpless than before cause now the bullies beat me by 7 years experience.

From my point of view it is far better to equip your child with the tools necessary to overcome their problems as opposed to attempt to remove them from them because the problem won't disappear... It just gets bigger without you having to look at it. Then the child is left older with a much larger issue than before and still has no tools to overcome it.

Unfortunately from the decisions made in past I have ended up an addict who is really struggling to learn these things now as a 21 year old that I should have learned when I was 8."

addiction,fom1voa,t1_fom0xz3,1587876047.0,"I enjoy talking about addiction, pharmacology and mental illness so I could chat to you for hours and hours without break which is why you're not seeing a deficit in attention. I'm basically hanging off my phone for a response and buying time between messages by fidgeting or rolling on the floor.

I dunno, maybe I do have some kind of bipolar??? I dunno man, I got no clue what's wrong with me. I just know my emotions drag me by the ear to do what ever they wanna do. Oh I'm also extremely suceptable to the placebo response."
addiction,fom1ljp,t1_fom0xz3,1587875835.0,"I'm 21
Drugs of choice seem to be alcohol, opiates (hardly ever use cause I can never find them but you can bet if I have them they aren't lasting long) and benzos. Just things that slow the thinking. I do have ritalin which works but unfortunately hasn't stopped the abuse of other substances, but I'm taking the weekend off for aahh, don't know really, just am. As for the focus part, I'm capable of focusing and focusing better than anyone I know but I have very little control over what I focus on. Can I read and comprehend complex writings from Dostoyevsky or Victor Frankle, sure can. Can I force myself to do emails I don't want to be doing, not even if you put a gun to my head..."

Got in a relationship and was married within months at 20 years old. Driving through snowy conditions you need a 4x4 for in a Honda civic with some snow chains. I'm just extremely impulsive, always have been."
addiction,fom065i,t1_folybyb,1587874774.0,"Energy shifts with mood, within the same day I'll start of hardly able to get out of bed thinking stereotypical depressive thoughts and then something will happen like I'll stumble across a particular song and boom, surge of adrenaline now I'm up. I usually make use of it by working out like an animal chasing prey or I'm forced to repress the aggression and it turns to anger and that mind state will stay until something else happens to swap it like I'll turn on a video game I enjoy and it swaps to calm total and unbreakable focus. 

As to what causes these shifts is not up to me, if nothing happens to swap my mood I'll be stuck there all day. 16 hour video game binges cause I'm just locked in a trance or I'll be a right asshole and piss off everyone because I'm in a people are disgusting mood and nothings come along to change it.
4 hour workouts cause the adrenaline just keeps flowing and I'm loving the feeling of intense exertion. Oh and if I'm bored and can't find something stimulating enough I'll wind my brain in knots thinking and thinking and thinking because nothing I try to do seems to hold any weight in my mind, boredom sometimes gets physically uncomfortable for me like I'll become so aware of what I'm wearing that the tag on my shirt feels like needles or the position I'm in is making me feel weird so I'll just endlessly finger trying to find comfort."
addiction,folwshz,t1_folv7o6,1587872365.0,"I've been diagnosed as ADHD which does have surface behaviour overlap with bipolar. I tend to lead toward the ADHD diagnosis because I don't go through periods of mania where I'll be up all night and feeling great and have boundless energy but I will stay up all night if I'm into something and get stuck in hyperfocus. 

As for the changes in mood based on pretty much what's happening that hour, ADHD includes poor emotional regulation. When I'm angry, I'm furious, when I'm depressed I'll drag antoke around me down with a sharp tongue and indisputable arguments as to why things suck and will never get better. When I'm excited about something, I'm insanely excited, I'll work myself into the ground with a smile on my face and a skip in my step till the jobs done if I'm interested in the job. 

I don't really go through uncontrolled highs and lows for notable lengths of time, I seem to just experience extreme emotions and have no idea how to handle them so they just spill out all over the place. I woke up and decided this morning I was pissed so I argued with everyone and stormed around until I'd had my workout which usually calms me down and I'm feeling a lot more level headed now."

addiction,folftjn,t1_foleyp2,1587861311.0,"A man who has a why can bare any how. 

I'm not talking about tragedy, I'm talking about total loss of purpose. You have a why to bare your hows. I do not. I have no reason to deal with the sufferings of life, so I don't. That makes total sense for one to do so. 

So I'll ask again, strip all positive meaning and purpose from your life. You have nothing to do but wait around until eventually you die, nothing to care for, nothing to work towards, nothing to love. Still think you'd remain sober?

And as for only knowing immediate gratefecation, that's a bold statement given that you only know generalizations about me. I spent half a decade working like a pack horse to earn a black belt in taekwondo. I've spent years training to do things like free standing handstand push ups, bench pressing 140kg, deadlifting 200kg, spent 2 years studying to become a personal trainer. Delayed gratefecation is no foreign concept to me 

I'm not about immediate gratefecation, I'm about not suffering when the suffering has no purpose whatsoever."
addiction,folee8y,t1_folc4hb,1587860442.0,"See how you've got this goal you want to accomplish. This thing to wake up for and work at that's a positive thing and obviously means a great deal to you. Yeah, now take that away, have it stripped from you. Reckon you'd stay sober? 

I'm looking for something similar, a worthwhile goal to accomplish, a life long problem to solve, a reason for my existence. Without that there's no difference between being awake, asleep or dead. That's my ""higher power"" or whatever. Something to fuckin do."
addiction,folauym,t1_fol8znv,1587858346.0,"I've been through years of therapy and have definitely tried that. My issue with that is, I'm not okay with just being. I need to be doing something, I can't just sit in a chair and enjoy listening to the sounds around me, I need to be doing something. 

If I become okay with simply existing and start loving myself for who I am then that is the penultimate excuse to continue doing what I'm doing. I take drugs to make me okay with doing fuck all and just sitting and enjoying what's around me. Without them it drives me insane, my body gets restless  my mind, which is already extremely fast, speeds up and my existence becomes one of discomfort. 

I need to be doing something and that something needs to feel as though it's worth doing. I know exactly what my own personal cure is and I'm working towards it but I've been at it for 2 years and have sown no fruit for my labours. 

My cure is finding purpose, a reason for being. Without that, there is no reason to be and thus no reason to exist. Now I don't want to commit suicide as families never recover from that so I choose drugs, a happy medium between life and death, you're alive but not feeling all too much and what you feel is up to you. 

I am not looking for some grand purpose, I'm not trying to change the world, I'm not aiming for anything grandiose. I'm just searching for a job I can engage with, that's all. I really feel like that's not to much to ask."
addiction,fol7v89,t1_fol7bq3,1587856612.0,"I know exactly what I need, I need purpose, I need a positive meaning. When suffering is given meaning it ceases to be suffering. When I have something I have to do that day that I find positive and meaningful my whole mindset shifts. It becomes about how can I do this job as well as I can, how can I get rid of the drugs cause they fuck my head up and hinder me from doing my best. I don't need to believe some random idea of a higher power, I need meaning in ny life, I need a reason to exist. Not God or a modern day God substitute."
