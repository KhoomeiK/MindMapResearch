TCD,fr1o02w,t1_fr1nunr,1589823022.0,For their first year they're put in halls after that they get put on campus :)
TCD,fr1cdyk,t3_gm3n27,1589817248.0,"I don't know the exact statistics but there will be students of all ages in halls, obviously the biggest demographic will be 18 year olds but there will be 2020 scholarship students who will be 20/21+, there will also be students in your scenario, north Americans coming over to study degrees like medicine are also older and may be in halls they are usually 24+ and sometimes trinity students who can't find accommodation elsewhere. All in all if its your most viable option I'd say go for it. :) I'll be in halls next year I'm turning 20 in September and will be in 3rd year."

depression,foafxe0,t1_foad9mm,1587645925.0,I agree with you 100%. Even changing my own mindset is bloody difficult let alone having others change theirs.
depression,foaakuz,t3_g6jgq0,1587643226.0,"I'm the same. Do everything, outwardly it seems like I'm on top of my game. Scholarship student, perfect university grades, sports, relationships, friends. I have everything yet I have absolutely nothing. As soon as I'm home I'm in bed crying. I go to therapy and it helps and then I relapse again and I start self-harming and the cycle repeats and meds make me extremely sad. No-one takes me seriously when I tell them I'm sad they just scoff and overlook it as exagerattion because I'm high functioning. They never get to see my sleepless nights, my salty eyes or cracking soul. They just see my achievements."
TCD,fo51zb5,t1_fo4x5kp,1587515788.0,"Med student here, we are separated from everyone. We don't pay attention to anyone and no-one pays attention to us :("
TCD,fo34pit,t3_g5fhpp,1587480505.0,"Social scene is good, we are in the centre of the city. So so socialising inside campus and outside campus is so fine. There are a lot of international students and everyone is generally friendly. We have a student bar and it's lovely on summer days like these. We have societies and clubs for all interests too. If you have any more questions just shoot me a pm!"

SuicideWatch,ffbouog,t1_ffbcvix,1579776279.0,"Going through this right now. My girlfriend barely even talks to me anymore, let alone kiss me, hug me, hold my hand or compliment me. She doesn't smile or laugh when I talk to her anymore, she makes up every excuse to get out of meeting up with me. I have had depression for quite a while and I understand that perhaps I shouldn't have gotten into a relationship in my state. But my god is this killing me slowly. I'm trying my best to become independent right now, get better mentally and work on myself but still the rejection hurts. Hopefully I'm as brave as you. This pain in my chest has been going on for quite a while now. It started off with random panic attacks and now it feels like I have a permanent one. Just nonstop breathlessness and anxiety. My negative thoughts are consuming me and destroying me from the inside."
robotics,ff8rbbi,t3_erwtex,1579692931.0,"I know it's a difficult decision, it's not too much help but I got accepted for Medicine in Cambridge and Imperial but decided it would be best for me financially to not go to either. I ended up staying in Ireland and studying at my local university. It's such a difficult choice but you are a hard worker evidently and so you shall succeed no matter where you go. I trust that you will eventually come to the right decision. I have no real insights into the university that others haven't already stated I just wanted to show a little bit of support. Congratulations and good luck in your studies!"
