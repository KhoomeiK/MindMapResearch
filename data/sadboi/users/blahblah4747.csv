at 32 i was unoficially diagnosed as bipolar during a mental-health rehab i went to, but i align more with BPD. this sounds so much like the way i grew up with narcissist parents who couldn't do any wrong.  they yelled at me for being weak and depressed and i just needed to 'just feel better, or suck it up everyone has baggage', they didnt believe in needing to medicate at all when i was a 18yr old battling depression.  i also was tested for adhd when i was really young and my parents neglected to put me on adderall/ritalin which also majorly affected my grades. i also went from 6 to 7th grade and my grades dropped like a rock until like my senior year of college. i don't know how the fuck i graduated...

now 35, post divorce and remarried, and finally have a good job and good life going and moved an hour from anything resembling family or parents, and back with the woman i dated 15 years ago as kids, my true love."

It sucks though because like we will go and randomly have a threesome and/or be fucking every other hour and then we‚Äôll go like two weeks without even touching each other because she‚Äôs in some kind of a funk relating to her abuse or stress level and I‚Äôll feel horrible like she‚Äôs cheating or isn‚Äôt attracted to me and she always reassures me it‚Äôs nothing and it‚Äôs her own shit and she doesn‚Äôt want to get into detail cause it‚Äôs horrifying and said some things don‚Äôt need to be shared.

On our first date 15 years ago it took us about 20 minutes to start making out and we made love in the first day. Fast forward to now, both post divorce from exes, we both found each other  again after so long and had the same thing happen. Boom naked within minutes. 

I know we have a greater passion than anyone else I‚Äôve ever been with in my life and our sex life is generally amazing, but it hurts when the person you love the most that you know has that passion for you can‚Äôt feel at that moment or very often recently due to her own issues relating to abuse etc.  

I know it won‚Äôt be forever and she‚Äôs just going through a funk, but it doesn‚Äôt make it not hurt even though we understand. It makes me feel like a pervert who is just begging to get vagina versus her fianc√©/husband who is just wanting to touch the woman that he absolutely loves and adores. The more I miss her and we don‚Äôt make love, the more I long for her touch. The other day she just kissed me only and I literally almost fell asleep because I was so happy and relaxed and satisfied from just her soft kiss.

I‚Äôm a pretty consistent guy generally so when we consistently don‚Äôt make love at least once a day or a few times a week it gets me very concerned even though I know the truth about why it‚Äôs happening. I trust her enough to know it‚Äôs not my fault and she understands that I have to ask that several times because of my own shit, plus I‚Äôve been cheated on by several women and my ex-wife lost all attraction to me and made me feel like shit for wanting sex regularly."

I don‚Äôt masturbate during or whatever like I used to do to that horrible shit, but now if I start going down into my dark space I find excuse to close the tab and stop immediately. I happen to sexualize pretty much everything and I feel like I want sex sometimes a lot more than my fianc√© sometimes, and I really just can‚Äôt turn off sexuality sometimes and it sucks, plus being a guy, who are horn dogs already as it is by nature. 

It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre young or old or black or white or any combination of anything to be a human, even guys. I‚Äôm bisexual now and me and the Mrs. have some fun occasionally with other people, but I‚Äôm still wondering about my own abuse if something happened and how the fuck I ended up looking at that stuff in the first place, because I never wanted this shit.

My fianc√© got abused by her dad when she was a little girl and now she has disassociative identity disorder from a few years ago when she lost her mind and remembered everything. Sometimes our sex drives can be a mismatch but also they coincide because of shit that we‚Äôve experienced. 

I have BPD and she has DiD. We are fun lol. 

Therapy is usually every other week on Sundays and I‚Äôve been seeing the same therapist for almost 2 years now. I am much happier and in love with my gf (now fianc√©) from 15 years ago. We dated as teens for a few months lol.

 but in the last 2 1/2 years I went through a divorce, rehab, getting fired, and abusing mostly weed and I‚Äôm taking lamotrigine. I went through severe bullying as a kid and have a lots of sexual weirdness about myself that I remember growing up as a kid and teenager before I was in therapy.

Read it has been really great to find other people who are like me and have seen some shit on the Internet and also have experience with bullying and other shit that led to me being the way I am now. 

Blah blah blah if anybody would like to have more of a discussion feel free to PM me. 

I am going to be married to the love of my life in a few weeks, I had my first steady job in two years right now, and life is pretty good all together, and I love read it for the people on here on several subreddits that can help people like me, where I can feel safe to share my stories."

Ended up deleting my account with over a 10 year history. Partially due to divorce memories of all the nice things she used to do and say. Just hurtful and wanted a clean slate.

Now I have a new account 20 friends and could give 2 shits about them all on fb. Deleted all family because they just bitch and moan about all posts because they‚Äôre like blah blah you shouldn‚Äôt post that online usual old people worry.

LinkedIn I‚Äôm pretty chill and leave them alone.

Smule I have 1200 followers but still have deleted 99% of them because some people suck and I only want to keep in touch with certain singers. 

Definitely related to my daily life and feeling of pushing away people who haven‚Äôt done anything out of fear of them hurting me down the road. I say the worst things to my fianc√© and then 5 minutes later I cry because I can‚Äôt believe what I did to her. 

Having BPD feels like a curse. I hate the black/white feeling and it‚Äôs gotten worse the more I realize it.
