He also made an inappropriate penis joke when I brought hotdogs for my lunch. He also said I looked like one of his close friends that he always had a thing for. I put my foot down and said he made me uncomfortable, and he said he was only joking and that I should remember that he could fail me if I continued being disrespectful.
