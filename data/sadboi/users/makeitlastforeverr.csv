mentalhealth,fikyebj,t1_fics1i2,1582489707.0,This was very helpful!!! I actually let my dad know (through tears lol) that I’m sorry for not spending time with him but I’m mentally feeling better now and want to be open with him. We basically talked for almost 2 hours that night. It was really scary to start the convo but I’m glad my dad at least knows that I’m trying.
mentalhealth,fiky3mb,t1_fik50f0,1582489516.0,"Jesus, that’s awful. I had a manager talk shit behind my back when I asked him to talk to another coworker because they made me feel uncomfortable. I have eczema on my face and kept getting comments about it, driving my anxiety through the roof. I heard from someone that he was kinda joking about how sensitive I am."
mentalhealth,fikxqzm,t3_f89un5,1582489296.0,"Last night my grandpa (I’m staying with him rn) freaked out on me for not brushing my teeth in two days. I was stuck in bed and instead of trying to openly talk to me, he started yelling and blaming himself. Pretty much sending me into a guilt spiral. Saying things like “how did you get like this,” “you really don’t care about me, huh? You’re just gonna ignore all my advice,” etc. 

I tried to leave and he ended up blocking the door and just kept shouting for another five minutes. He’s 82 and is very older generation Chinese, so I understand all of this comes from a place of love and concern. I just wish mental health was more understood in my family."
AmItheAsshole,fictdmh,t1_fics75z,1582356432.0,"I completely agree. I’m 22 and have been recently really trying to get better because I don’t want to be a burden anymore. The only thing with getting professional help and meds again is my shit insurance. After my dad got sick we couldn’t afford what we had and had to switch. Dealing w the new insurance has been a nightmare. 

I’m in a recovery program (started in December when my dad got home), but I noticed without the therapy and meds, it’s impossible for me to stay on track."
AmItheAsshole,ficqkj3,t1_ficpw72,1582354321.0,Thank you for the advice :) now that I am on the upside of my depression cycle I’m motivated to do things like find a new therapist. I’ll definitely be taking advantage of this feeling!
AmItheAsshole,ficqegi,t1_ficoznh,1582354193.0,"Thank you for the input, I can see where you’re coming from. And I agree with you to a certain degree. When it comes to my dad, he’s done so much for me and I want to show him the same support, especially right now."
AmItheAsshole,ficpu4t,t1_ficp4a6,1582354011.0,I can and want to actually. I just don’t know why it’s so hard for me to stick with someone for more than a month or two.
AmItheAsshole,ficppfx,t1_ficov0h,1582353876.0,"Awww this was very sweet, thank you for the kind words. And he tells me it’s okay when I don’t spend a lot of time with him, but I feel like I can hear the pain in his voice. I wanna get better if not for me, at least for him."
AmItheAsshole,ficp28j,t1_fico1xz,1582353595.0,I have been in and out of therapy for about 10 years and kinda just gave up on finding a new one recently. I tried medication last year but my insurance fucked up after my dad got sick. Complicated situation but now I’m not seeing anyone or taking anything :/
AmItheAsshole,ficoxzs,t1_ficnn63,1582353487.0,"“You can’t be a caregiver without first taking care of yourself”

Wow, I know it’s simple but I needed to hear that. It’s hard for me to put myself first."
mentalhealth,fickagf,t3_f7lybe,1582349929.0,"I isolate when I get into my cycles too. I’ll go months without talking to friends or family and then usually have about two weeks of normalcy. 

For me, what helps a lot is trying to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. Go to those therapy appointments, reach out to people, get help because it honestly will change your mindset. It helped me go from thinking “there’s no hope, I might as well keep doing what I’m doing, I’ll never get better, etc.” to “okay, I feel like absolute shit. I’m gonna text my friend for support.” Or I’ll walk my dog and get fresh air. 

Sorry if this sounds preachy and cliche, but getting help will help break your unhealthy patterns of thinking. I’m not saying something like therapy will magically cure you after one session, but I believe going to get help consistently will give you the necessary coping mechanisms to help w depression."
trichotillomania,fi0e40t,t3_f5pq0x,1582034703.0,"I’d definitely bring it up to my doctor. Just let them know that the meds are affecting your OCD and see what they recommend. The same thing happened to me a year ago. 

It’s frustrating and annoying to have to start a new med and to search for one that works, but it’s worth it to not wake up to a stiff neck and arm from hours of pulling the night before. 

I hope you find a solution soon!"
trichotillomania,fi00wbe,t3_f44h5t,1582021192.0,"I’ve tried castor oil on both my lashes and brows for a month! Since I don’t pull too much of my lashes out, I just noticed the length noticeably improved, so sorry I can’t speak too much on that. 

But it worked magically on my brows. Tweezers are my weakness so I’m always looking for brow products. I noticed most of my bald spots were filled in and my brows just looked a lot darker overall. 

I hope you find a product that works, good luck! :)"
