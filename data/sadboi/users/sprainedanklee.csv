pcmusic,fpr72em,t1_fpnygdj,1588844759.0,I saw SOPHIE at SAT and obviously it's a small venue but it was soooo incredible
mentalillness,faicxay,t3_e9ep84,1576104887.0,"I don't have experience with those but I will say that I think reluctance to rely on a need is engrained within us by society and may be something you should shed for your own good. You wouldn't think this about a diabetic person and their insulin, right?"
Emo,facmy4s,t3_e8haaf,1575942679.0,I would like that (:

sugarlifestyleforum,f6nmr83,t1_f6mb0pl,1572994982.0,No. Bisexual is commonly thought of as attraction to one’s own gender and another gender. So the other gender can be male/female or non-binary. The thought of bisexuality being transphobic is outdated.

SavageGarden,evssaj4,t1_evs51bu,1564755048.0,I've also read (and had it happen to me) that they take time to get acclimated to new conditions and will dry up because of that!

AmItheAsshole,eqm2n0r,t3_bytj5r,1560155243.0,"YWBTA. Prison is not a good place for someone with mental health problems. As someone with bipolar depression, I would likely attempt suicide if put into somewhere that limited my available coping skills. I would suggest having her involuntarily committed, as she seems to be a danger to herself. Look up involuntary commitment by state to get more information."
ThriftStoreHauls,eqki3nq,t1_eqkf2zq,1560123738.0,Ah I didn't know! Will do ;)

SkincareAddiction,eqk2fwv,t1_eqj1nd2,1560115088.0,"Thank you! My experience was good. I got the PicoSure, which I've read to be more efficient than Q switched. I've read that it's important to go to a dermatologist/MD rather than a tattoo parlor or somewhere that only specializes in tattoo removal. I am glad I did it! Feel free to message me if you have more questions."

SkincareAddiction,eqfuj4o,t1_eqfu4ie,1560026893.0,"She only really told me about immediate aftercare, which was to use Eucerin! I'm having a hard time finding information about what to do now that it's the texture of normal skin."
SkincareAddiction,eqfu2ep,t3_bycc1x,1560026638.0,I tried to search if this has been asked before but all previous parts seemed to be for earlier stages of healing. Right now all I am doing is daily putting bio oil on it! It seems to be similar to the skin under any sort of scab. Now that it's summer I'm self conscious of having this on my arm! Any help would be appreciated.

wholesomememes,epvh1as,t1_epvgbz6,1559533970.0,"I actually have a degree in biology! Make and female are associated with certain chromosomal, hormonal, primary and secondary sex characteristics. However, a large portion of people are born with abnormalities, such as being intersex or having Klinefelters syndrome. Additionally, while sex is assigned at birth, gender is a social construct. There is no reason women have to do anything or men have to do anything, so it makes perfect sense for someone to feel no attachment to either term. There is a great amount of variation between the binaries, both socially and physiologically. Hope this makes sense!"
