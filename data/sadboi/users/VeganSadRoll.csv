depression,es1ssbw,t3_c5gmaf,1561504828.0,"I feel you 100%. Tests suck because they seem to remind you all the other negative things in your life. Just remember it's just a test. 

And I understand how you feel about almost everything. I met a friend a while ago whom I felt comfortable around, and even though I could barely speak, she understood, and helped me a bit. Then everything changed when the ghosting nation attacked. 

Then we add a dysfunctional family, and those are the perfect ingredients for a ""everybody hates me"" smoothie. The feeling of isolation and depression sting a lot, and sure like suicide does feel like the only solution. But there is a possibility that things could get better. Just stay strong, and persevere. I know that sounds super clich√©, but just know I believe in you. All of this coming from someone who is in a similar situation, and experienced / experiencing these things. ‚ô•Ô∏è"
