You’re supposed to be “asleep” at this point so you shouldn’t be conscious of what your physical body is manifesting. Just relax until you fall asleep and eventually you’ll drift into this dream state. 

In this dream, you’ll see that your just lying down in the position you fell asleep in. This is where the vibration stage occurs and when it happens just keep it going and going until it suddenly hits a plateau. at this point, your mind should now be aware that you are actually IN a dream. Congratulations, you’re now “half-asleep/half-awake”.

AstralProjection,f6gng2o,t1_f6gi3qr,1572828113.0,I think if you accept it as a positive feeling it will tune in with the vibrations and both will eventually subside.

AstralProjection,f6g3phj,t1_f6fy1ep,1572821434.0,Im not an expert and very new to this. Somebody correct me if im veering off course but I would stick to the silence. Have you ever heard the phrase “the sound of silence”? It’s quite a distinct high pitched tone ringing in your ear under very quiet conditions. If you can identify this sound before your body falls asleep and focus on it I think you’re in the right track. This is just based from past sleep paralysis experiences and not AP.

rolex,f262h9h,t3_d9f3p7,1569990977.0,"Try this approach. Before entering an AD try to identify who the floor/shift manager is. Approach this person and introduce yourself, ask for their name, shake their hand. Be straightforward and say your looking for the GMT. If they turn you down thats fine. Don’t leave the store just yet. Browse their inventory. They will ask you if something else has caught your fancy. If you find one, try it on. If they offer you something like water or coffee, dont decline. Now the game is on. Ask questions. At this point, they are starting to feel you out to see if your serious or not. 

Ask more questions about the brand, the watch market, the history of the AD, anything under the sun. Be real and just be yourself. Try to develop rapport while having this conversation with the AD. During this conversation you’ll find out if you like this AD and vice versa. If you had a great time just ask if you may leave your contact info before you leave, just in case. 

If they say yes, then thats a good sign. You’re now a potential customer. This is how you get an AD to enter your name on a “list” without purchase history even if said list does not exist. Now if they say no and don’t take your contact info, that means they’re not interested in your business and its time to find a different AD."

It’s been a year since and every now and then I still watch some of his shows. You can actually identify some of the watches he wears in some of the episodes. Hopefully, I would be able to acquire some of the same watches he owns like the Tag Heuer Monaco. 

I was able to acquire this Tudor GMT after a 6 month wait. It’s the perfect travel watch. Simple design and flys under the radar.
