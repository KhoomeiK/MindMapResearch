Or you get Gloves with the say Weapon Damage Roll, Weapon, Skill Damage and Skill Haste. But only the Damage rolls apply, since that is what matters most in the DZ damage to other players.

Instead of elevating society, we have a whole group of people called ‘Social Influencers.’ Who are these people? Not scholars, Educators, Philosophers, Ministers. It’s someone who is paid to make you want to buy someone’s products or services. What makes someone a social influencers? Nothing more then vanity and looks. 

You are right, someone see’s your lack of social media as a red flag she isn’t the kinda you don’t want to date or marry. Cause her phone will never leave her hands u less she’s asleep. And even they it’s beside her on the pillow."

The most annoying thing I found, listening to him talk to his viewers. If your going to stream mute you in game mic and talk to your viewers. Don’t irritate the other players in the mission with, to us what would be mindless babbling cause we’re not on your stream seeing the chat log.  It’s pretty much the same as someone yelling at their kids to leave them alone to play the game, again, something else that should never happen....just saying, family over a video game. 

Some will say he was playing with viewers, nope, it was a PUG mission, all four fandoms."

Breath properly, and form is everything. No one wants to hear your loud moaning, grunting or screaming. It will not make you lift more. Just makes you look like a fool.
