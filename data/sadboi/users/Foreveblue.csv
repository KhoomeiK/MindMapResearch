SuicideWatch,fqtiq9w,t3_gklxw4,1589639798.0,Haha hang in there buddy. I've been living with wanting to die for long that my brain has shut down internally as it became obsolete and totally incapable of carrying on social and emotional and cognitive tasks except for basic human tasks of keeping me alive.. kind of living life on autopilot. Waiting for the perfect day where I'd rather kill myself or wait for the build up of enough existential angst to end myself.

depression,fp13f4q,t3_gaipig,1588223331.0,Same mate. I'm just waiting till this year. It's Ramadan now. They always say this month is full of blessings I've lived through 20 ramadans so far feeling devastated by every passing year hoping next Ramadan will be better only to find myself utterly disappointed the way my life's going ..

SuicideWatch,foaq118,t3_g6fhwo,1587650703.0,Holy shit.. reading this felt like I'm reading about myself ..!!  Literally every word felt as if it's from my mind.. this is exactly how I feel. Every day.. every night.. and right now I'm listening to sickick the one song.. which usually keeps me going.. roaming on the terrace aimlessly thinking what is the point of life.  Even though I go through hell and prove everyone I'm successful too.. why.. the only voice that pops in my background is.. you owe it to your mom.. after all she's gone through for you the least u can do is pay her back by making her happy .. my mom's been sad and probably depressed since even before I was borne I guess.. I always seen her sad.. because of my dad and family issues but she never gave up on us.. after my brother ended up with major depression.. the only hope she's left with is me.. and I can't afford to let her down.. this is just crushing me ..  at times this stress becomes so unbearable that I pass out in my bed followed with cold chills in my spine while sweating profusely and a pounding heartbeat in my ears.. don't even know what the fuck that means.. after losing the only shithead job of data entry due to corona virus.. I'm utterly hopeless and exhausted with myself.. I feel like I'm not even useful to myself let alone trying the be better someone else...
SuicideWatch,fo6ctvo,t3_g5ejp3,1587554948.0,Thats because people out there are having a great time and want new ways of entertaining themselves.. whole lot of entertainment out over there but nah. They seek enjoyment out of judging .. and passing down unsolicited advices upon hearing our depressed and dark life histories and say .. hey.. stop stressing out so much!! It's normal.. it'll settle down soon..
