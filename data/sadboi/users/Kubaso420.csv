AskReddit,foin5tj,t3_g7id84,1587791012.0,"Both with a good balance. Though I prefer psychological. 

 I think that the Saw movies are a good example although those movies lean onto one half.  if the movies were made for that balance it'd be cool. I'm not saying they're bad. The movies are amazing I just think that if there was more balance between the 'contestants' trying to win the game (psychological horror) and the gore it'd be more mind fucking.


This was more of a movie review. Let me explain. 

The Saw movies are a good example since you have the psychological side which is the jigsaws view where if you don't appreciate life, you don't deserve it therefore he will make you play games that will hurt you but if you like life enough you can get out of there alive.  And you have the gorey messy side.

I think that psychological horror is cool since you can have more theories. Get Out had loads of theories which it had because psychology is such an open topic. Saw had theories too but just because the movies are a mess and there are flashbacks within flashbacks and the time-line is a joke.

The Saw movies made you think. Like shit would they get me? Do I appreciate life? And stuff. That is if you understood the time-line a little and went by jigsaws psychology which I agree with though many people don't.

The messy side is fun too but only in movies. I like seeing how it came to be, the practical effects, the visual effects and all the other stuff behind the scenes. I don't like actual gore.

This took me way too much time what am I doing a haven't slept the entire night."

She told me she had mental breakdowns and stuff and texted him long texts of how he was too good for her and that she's lucky to even have had a chance. He also broke up with her out of the blue. She didn't see it coming.
