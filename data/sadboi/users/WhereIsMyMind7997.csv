Employees and employers are free to end employment at any time for any reason unless you have a contract and/or union job.  I'm so afraid that I won't get unemployment due to being fired, and jobs are increasingly becoming harder to find the longer the quarrentine and economic downturn in the USA continue.   I'm really worried for my family.   I also feel really sad and used.  I'm doing everything I can to move on, but there's so much waiting.   My mental health is in pretty bad shape right now.

Anxiety,fms68tp,t1_fml3g6a,1586347842.0,"It's really hard to navigate situations like this.  How are you doing?  Do you feel safe?  When ex boyfriends are around, your current one will always feel threatened.   It might be helpful to know where that insecurity is coming from.  Is he afraid of losing you, or afraid of losing face?  Could be a combination, or some other 3rd option.  My hubs is the jealous type, but when we met I was super flirty.  It made him jealous any time we had to be in the same place as a guy i even crushed on a long time ago.  He was never scary though.  I ended a lot of life-long friendships for him.  Unfriended so many Facebook friends.  It was heartbreaking, and super awkward when we ran into guys i was friends with, but had unfriended because some of the time they didn't do anything.   I don't know that there's a solution, really.  All guys are insecure about something just like us ladies.  This doesn't have to be a deal breaker.  Just another idiosyncrasy of relationships.   For me it worth it.  I really hate the feeling of shame. Especially when it's coming from people we slept with in the past.  There's no way to change it. I don't like feeling dirty and not special.  I guess its part of life.  I'm here for you if you need to vent.  You seem sweet.  I've been married for almost 20 years.  Most of them were a struggle but we're actually finding our grove here in our 40s and it's never been better.  Good luck friend."

Anxiety,fml3g6a,t3_fvxrda,1586177600.0,"The problem isn't you, or the choices you've made.  The problem is our patriarchal society.  Sexuality is a type of super power that women have, and men view as a threat.  That's why the whole idea of 'slut' came into existence.   Men dominate society because their natural 'superpowers' (e.g. physical strength, agression) are rewarded.   It's how men get everything they want.  Women can get a lot of what they want/need via sex.  That's why men made it shameful for women use sex for anything other than procreation.  It cut off our natural power and automatically eliminated 50% of mens' competition in society.  What you did in the past is nothing to be ashamed of.  If it lead to STDs, they can be treated.  If it led to pregnancy, you have a of couple awesome children.  You're vagina is just as perfect as it ever was.  You can't un-ring your bell, but you can go forward as a strong confident woman who used sex to control some situations.   That's ok.  It's your natural feminine power.   These actions have absolutely no baring on your value as a human being.  You are not ruined, or a slut, or any other oppressive adjective created by men to keep you from realizing your potential."

If I get to high, I experience the same freaking out feeling and this is after years of use.  If you ever use it again, use even less.  If you use a vape pen you can measure your dose by the number of seconds you draw.  3 seconds would be a medium size dose for those, who like us, are prone to paranoia and have a tendency to freak out.  It's harder to control the dose when smoking in my experience. If you're using it medically there's still a chance it can work for you if you find the ideal dose. If it's recreational, I would say use less more often.  Some people smoke blunts and happily stay fucked up for hours. I can't do that much at once. I would rather carry my own supply and take a hit here and there throughout the evening and just keep it level and calm."
