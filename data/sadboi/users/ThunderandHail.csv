Advice,flih5fe,t1_flfnz4g,1585182418.0,That’s exactly my point but it’s a very circumstantial situation. You probably need details to understand why I’m doing it

talk,fdq7x4c,t1_fdpv28n,1578658596.0,"Okay well then, my best advice to you is to inspect her own financial endeavor and find out what she has spent money on in the present or past. If you can find something to her that’s described as “making it count” that might urge her to either leave you be or she would be proud of you. You’ve spent time with her growing up and if you Can think of anything at all that she has spent a good amount of money on that she would describe as meaningful take it and make it be what you tell her, 
It’s a good way to trick a narcissist into thinking you look up to them by mimicking their choices, I use this one all the time dealing with narcissists 

If not, the only other reasonable advice I have for you (because I don’t know your full situation or the people involved) is to tell her you gave it to a worthy cause (bonus points if she supports it herself). Giving it to a charity is a good mirage and redirects all questions because it’s a good idea and it definitely means something 
Again, I don’t know you, your family or your mom and their stance on charities but this is the advice I have for you 
Hope everything works out."
talk,fdpoozp,t3_emlrwi,1578634857.0,"Just tell her that you are, in fact, “Making it mean something” and that she doesn’t have to worry about it,."
