ChronicIllness,fr5sknz,t3_gmrg11,1589913954.0,"TSHC is a test that will trigger more tests if your TSH is less than .1 or higher than 4.2.  


That's great, but there are a lot of sick people between .1 and 4.2. Most people feel their best with a TSH around 1.0 and a few, like me, need to be a little closer to 2.0. There are a lot of people who are suffering awful hypothyroidism with a TSH of 3.5, for instance.

  
I suggest you see a relatively young (under 40) internist. They're better trained on low thyroid issues than GPs or even endocrinologists are. I don't know why endos are so damned stubborn, they don't want to acknowledge new research that shows how sick someone can be in that *huge* TSH range. Even gynecologists have taken the treatment of pregnant thyroid patients in hand because they're sick of seeing the damage done to babies and mothers due to inadequate thyroid treatment.   


What someone like you needs, at minimum, is a TSH, a free T3, a free t4, reverse T3, and antibody tests. Don't shut up until you get every single one of these. It's quite possible that every symptom you have will clear up if your thyroid is treated properly  


If you want to DM me your city, I can help you find a doctor who can help you. I'm really good at this. I was sick for 13 years before I got my thyroid disease diagnosed. I've been a staunch advocate of proper thyroid disease detection ever since, even volunteering an thyroid advocacy program for 2 years. You have simply had the wrong doctors. And there are a bunch of them. GPs are beholden to the advice of endocrinologists who are in the stone age where hypothyroidism is concerned. They're great with hyperthyroidism, but *suck* on the hypo side."

What are the different characteristics? Not that they all need to be set in stone, but what are the broad strokes?   


You have to see how whiplashing it is to come out of a culture still colored by second-wave feminism that insisted, ad nauseum, that everything gender was a construct of the patriarchy.  In third-wave feminism we don't have to guess, because science proves again and again that women have the same intellectual and creative gifts that men do whenever they've been allowed to explore them. 

In the meantime, so many of us have strived for an equality that negates societal expectations.   


And women are still fighting all of their lives to get the acceptance and respect that default to men. We want a leveling of the playing field, we strive for it constantly. We yearn for a reconstruction that considers our personhood, merit and skills rather than demeaning gender stereotypes.

Just an aside, but perhaps a helpful example of contrast: celiac rock star Dr. Alessio Fasano's research indicates that non-celiac gluten sensitivity is a misapplication of the innate immune response, whereas celiac disease is an adaptive immune response that produces antibodies to gluten that can be counted in a lab for the purpose of celiac diagnosis.   


There are no definitive tests for non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), but the symptoms and the range of patients' experience of severity are almost identical.   


It's believed there is some epithelial (lining of intestine) damage with NCGS, but not nearly as much as with celiac disease, which causes a huge increase in levels of zonulin that leads to villous blunting (damage to the hair-like villi in the intestinal lining.)"

""In the Southern states the development of American policing followed a different path. The genesis of the modern police organization in the South is the ""Slave Patrol"" (Platt 1982). The first formal slave patrol was created in the Carolina colonies in 1704 (Reichel 1992). Slave patrols had three primary functions: (1) to chase down, apprehend, and return to their owners, runaway slaves; (2) to provide a form of organized terror to deter slave revolts; and, (3) to maintain a form of discipline for slave-workers who were subject to summary justice, outside of the law, if they violated any plantation rules. Following the Civil War, these vigilante-style organizations evolved in modern Southern police departments primarily as a means of controlling freed slaves who were now laborers working in an agricultural caste system, and enforcing ""Jim Crow"" segregation laws, designed to deny freed slaves equal rights and access to the political system."""
