We were there and we brought her home and buried her in a special place. 

It was hard to not see her around the house. I swear I saw her on her pillow a couple days after her death. It‚Äôs still hard. We talk about her. Like we picked up some sticks in the front yard before mowing the other day. She used to come out with us and grab a stick of her own. Her sticks are still by the front door.

Have you tried to call her? I wasn‚Äôt sure if y‚Äôall had. I‚Äôm currently in my second year of college. It is stressful. College in general is stressful. She probably really appreciates the support but she‚Äôs one of a few things: stressed, overwhelmed, or depressed.  Not responding for three months is not normal and needs to be investigated. 

When I get as going through a bad episode with my depression, I didn‚Äôt get out of bed but to go to class, I read messages but I send like one word replies to keep my family happy (I definitely stressed/ still do stress about keeping my family happy because they do pay for my college). 

We know you guys are worried, but she‚Äôs probably stressing about a ton of things at once while being out of state in college (aka she‚Äôs a good bit away from her family).

At some colleges there is s crisis hotline for someone to anonymously report a student and give them a welfare check. At the school I attend, the mental health care team meets with the student and makes sure they‚Äôre safe and gets them the health they need. They won‚Äôt necessarily report back to you, but they will help make sure your child is safe and okay. And that‚Äôs what matters"

Homophobia sucks. And it sucks that OP is having to go through any of this."
childfree,f8xlxai,t3_e2qrod,1574923358.0,"I‚Äôm 19 (and CF of course) with depression, anxiety, possible sleep apnea and an unsteady thyroid that doesn‚Äôt want to level out. I‚Äôm so tired it‚Äôs not even funny. 

I woke up yesterday (Tuesday) morning to my 8am class being cancelled and went back to sleep... until 1:30pm. I went to bed at like 9:30 Monday night before this. 

I also work night shift on the weekends so that‚Äôs cool. But yeah. I‚Äôm always tired. For many reasons.

Edit to add: 

Everyone has the right/ability to be tired. And one excuse is not necessarily ‚Äúbetter than‚Äù another. Some people get tired faster and it‚Äôs okay. 
I just had wanted to talk about how no matter how much I sleep, I don‚Äôt think I get much rest lol."
