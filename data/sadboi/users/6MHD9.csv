Firstly, accept that, no matter what the reasons and the circumestances were,that haapend and nothing would change.

Second, forget about here! 
It so hard, but day after another,it will work
I' d say Do not block here, feel free to delete the conversation in case it reminds you of her.

 Finally, keep in mind that you will meet a girl whom you can trust, that could take time, but it woths!"
