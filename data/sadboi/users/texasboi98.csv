Psychosis,fdfvu7b,t3_el1u6j,1578371578.0,I can assure you that you're not in hell. I had an almost identical experience that was weed induced putting me in a psych hospital for a week. After I was out I only took meds for a month because I believed it was due to the marijuana only. While I was off meds I was fine at first but I started to get more and more paranoid with thoughts about religion and if I were dead or not so I started to go to church and read the bible like a maniac. It was the weekend before finals when I had another crisis because of all the stress (the first one was the beginning of my first semester in college). In this episode I believed reality was hell again and that I needed to go to church to get to heaven so i went expecting jesus christ himself to be there and save me. I went and of course and nothing happened it was just a regular sunday lol. I went to a doctor and was diagnosed bipolar 2 and on meds ever since. Okay so my logic was because I mentally went to hell twice it isn't real because supposedly once you're there you're forever and because nothing happened when I went to church. So I came to realize that the mind could believe in anything especially if you're constantly thinking about it or while maniac. It took me about a year to stop having these thoughts

bipolar,ev2sv5u,t1_ev26bn0,1564183118.0,"Alright, so let's say the white means infinite positive energy, time etc and black is of course the opposite (they are separated). They exist in a infinite space (shaped as a circle) trying to take over each other; they are equally as fast so they evolved  to grow/teleport into each other using the 4th dimension (making the eyes of the symbol) thus creating time to make this possible...get it?"
