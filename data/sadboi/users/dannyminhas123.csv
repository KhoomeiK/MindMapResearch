She purposely messes with her and when she finally breaks they all ask her why shes acting out and tell her to stop over reacting.

islam,eprav3r,t1_eph3ulv,1559421336.0,"I know it might come off as tho I hate the hijab and I‚Äôm opposed to woman wearing it but that‚Äôs not the case. Some people find it beautiful and it makes some woman feel powerful and comfortable and I honestly think that‚Äôs great. I would never ever criticize someone for that. That example is from my real life. I don‚Äôt call the police because I respect their family and the girl would rather not cause a scene and just deal with it. By forced I mean if she took it off her family would flip out and her father might even kick her out. I‚Äôve heard of some fathers beating their daughters for stuff like this (tho it‚Äôs usually from backwards villages in Pakistan and I think I heard about it happening in New York but I can‚Äôt remember it clearly).  Btw Islam is patriarchal. Lineage is traced back with the father and the head positions are held by men. I don‚Äôt really care for this tho tbh but that‚Äôs how it is. All I‚Äôm stating is that forcing a woman to do anything is bad and you should take a different approach and such behavior should be denounced.

Again I didn‚Äôt mean to sound ignorant and I‚Äôm not the smartest person but I do enjoy these discussions and if you feel some type of way just explain to me why. I‚Äôd like to walk away with more knowledge and help you maybe understand why I feel the way I do."

islam,epjtiwg,t1_epj6299,1559260207.0,Yeah but a girl can walk around topless and be criticized for it and that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôd probably be like yo she needs to chill but in an Islamic society she‚Äôd be stoned to death. Do you see the difference. I don‚Äôt advocate for people to become completely shameless but Muslim communities are too focused on the idea of shame and punishing people who bring them shame and usually the woman are the ones who bring the most shame because their rules are stricter.

islam,epgol67,t1_epgmmne,1559216355.0,"Forced by whom? Forced by their families and the Muslim community. I know a girl who runs track in a fucking hijab. Woman getting abused and forced to take off their clothing is RAPE. That‚Äôs a different issue altogether (Although rape happens a lot more frequently in those Muslim countries than it does in the west btw). The problem isn‚Äôt fearing god or not, it‚Äôs that the god fearing people won‚Äôt let woman do what they want. Also what I meant is in my Muslim community (and most Muslim communities) it‚Äôs a lot ore acceptable for a man to be dressed a little less conservatively than it is for a woman. Also who said anything about stripping you moron? Shorts and a wife beater/ t-shirt isn‚Äôt stripping and I see plenty of people wearing it during summer over here.

islam,epgkj2r,t1_epfj46l,1559214761.0,Nah the reason it‚Äôs oppressive is cause it‚Äôs forced. Woman have to dress VERY conservatively in Muslim areas. I can walk around with shorts and a wife beater on a hot summer day but a girl can‚Äôt wear shorts and take off her hijab. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs oppressive.
