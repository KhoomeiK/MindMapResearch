I haven't heard any medical authorities advocate for that, but I think it's the overwhelmingly predominate opinion among people in California - they started opening retail curbside pickup this week, and most people I know were absolutely outraged at the sociopaths who were trying to kill their grandma with this dangerously risky move or whatever.  I worry that public opinion could create political pressure to keep all of this going long term.

As far as a year of my life - it's not just losing a year.  It's living a year in absolute social isolation, with no contact with other human beings.  I don't understand how people are doing this, and I'm not even really sure how I've made it 2 months without any physical touch whatsoever.  Every day is the most miserable day of my life, over and over and over.  That's pretty much where I am, but obviously most people don't seem to feel that way.
