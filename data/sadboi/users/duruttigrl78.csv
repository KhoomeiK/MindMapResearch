He certainly has lost touch with the real world and most importantly the people who have relied on his music to carry them through tough times. Also a massive hypocrite.

Made me also see I need to self improve for my own  well being. I hope someday you are strong enough to seek help. It is terrifying but god you gain hope for life and yourself again.

I make people trust exercise to the point they misinterpret me as just controlling and walk away. When I've had so much sexual violence and verbal abuse in my life, you tend to take on that endless cycle. Granted I'm in one now and it took me years. It is a polyamorous relationship, so I've had to fight many insecurities and former ways of thinking. Somehow I've found someone who can tolerate me and my mind. It's the best and worst thing all at once."

Also to be amused by since shaun Ryder is so brain fried from drugs. Never been on drugs myself though i have tried cigarettes over the years lol. Expensive habit and not good for you in the end.

penpals,fmg2h01,t1_fmg0huh,1586039859.0,"I got way too many songs I love of theirs. I like the deep cuts. So rich and personal. There is a small following of DC here. We are definitely smaller than England, Japan, and Portgual but in the underground scene they are respected. I've blown many minds by actually knowing another band on factory besides joy division. I got into DC through liking the Smiths. I really loved viva hate when I was still a morrissey fan. I listened to all kinds of manchester bands. I liked what I heard, but when I heard Snowflakes the first time, that really made me stop in awe of them. Seeing the domo arigato show on YT really bought it to life for me. The musicianship, the intensity, and beauty was just so unique. I can never adequately describe them to anyone. I then got to know Vini Reilly when he use to frequent social media. Tortured individual but wow what a fantastic musician. His life story needs to be properly told. Survived so much including 3 strokes!! He knows I love and respect him and at the end of the day, that gives me joy. Joy division I discovered years earlier by an art friend of mine. I was still a 60s snob, so I didn't understand it till years later. Now seems prophetic. The 80s in Manchester was a beautiful time I wish I could've lived through. Certainly beats this fucking one.
