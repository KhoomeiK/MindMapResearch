The ERversion worn too early and indeed it was mild. But I really find the one with this LA version. It keeps me on track. And indeed it messes with sleep. Sometimes I use sleep pills if necessary.

My doctor back then just upped upped upped my dose and added meds. I ended up takeing five sifferent pills. I had a sucide attempt and got locked up for two weeks on psych ward. I got out with more and stronger meds.. two days later I had another attempt...

The doctor in the psyh ward said first that he dont think that i am bipolar. I got throught a lot of tests..

This was five years ago. 

Today: 

I have ADHD-I & Spectrum disorder
I take 60mg Ritalin LA daily
I am happy I work I have a relationship and I am happy with my life. The first time I got stimulant meds my life turned 180 degrees in a week.

This could happen if a fucking stubborn psychiatrist dont care enough and sticks with their outdated methods.

I am not bipolar for sure. I sued the psychiatrist case going slow but I wont let him get away with this malpractice.

Anyway I am happy and live sort of normal life. :)"

About Gabapentin i really dont know but I think only about what you mentioned in the post that maybe he would have some benefit from medication. I am just not the right person to give any idea about it. Also a good therapist with intense therapy intervalls would definitely help him. It helps me aswell a lot today.

And now... My life literally turned 180 degrees. I am on Ritalin LA 60mg /day + Cymbalta 90 mg /day and b/c I am a really shitty sleeper I use 1mg Xanax before bed. Its short half life makes it gone from my system when i wake up so it wont counteract with the Ritalin. 

Basically I was no I am in a deep hole at least I am getting out of it. No anxiety no depression and finally some motivation and energy. My psychiatrist told me that my main issue is the ADHD  but i have ASD aswell but treating the ADHD used to help with ASD symptoms. At least this happened to me.

I only use them if I pass the five day mark. It is 2:30 am CET. If I could not fall asleep till 5 am  I am going to take medication. There are only three Rohypnol left so that will be todays choice.
