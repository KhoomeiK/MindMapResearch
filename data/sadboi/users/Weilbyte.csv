EscapefromTarkov,fkdv4gj,t3_fhxoun,1584096451.0,They lowered it back to level 10 but there's a bug that it shows you those errors. Hopefully they fix soon.
EscapefromTarkov,fkdterc,t1_fkdpt9y,1584094345.0,"Yes it did state that is in beta, which of course is a reason for the bug to happen but its understandable for people to be outraged. At least BSG are listening to feedback and are trying to balance stuff out. I agree that new mechanics are to be expected.       


The head bobbing effect is not just causing issues, but its also unrealistic as in real life our eyes stabilize our vision so we do not experience it. I don't think it should be removed, but rather should be made an option to turn off since it also negatively affects people with motion sickness.      


The last two contradict, yes, because the game is realistic in certain aspects and completely unrealistic in other ones. My point was that it should balance out in the middle for most aspects and not cherry pick which ones to have realism.       


Anyway people should still be rewarded being able to take the loot they took. They came in fully geared, yes, but they should still be able to take some stuff home (not saying they should be able to take an entire police department's worth of guns though). And smaller loot items? Sorry chads but the rats have already claimed those.          


I can kinda say I like the weight overhaul to some degree because my rat ass enjoys having the chads delayed to certain extents."
EscapefromTarkov,fkdlp44,t3_fhvkx1,1584083870.0,"It's a beta but that's absolutely no excuse. We both know that the game is staying as such for a very long time.      
      
The money bug is obviously not something they could predict happening but don't pretend that you wouldn't be mad for losing millions of roubles. Thankfully BSG have addressed that fast.    
    
I don't run with heavy gear often so I don't really have a negative experience with it so far. But judging by others posts, It looks horribly done. First is the headbobbing which is unrealistic.     
        
Second, soldiers in real life can put up with quite a bit of weight and still be able to run for more than 10 meters without an imminent asthma attack.     
        
Third, yes this game is supposed to be realistic but it's handling even that badly. Its more of a selective realism rather than complete realism. Either go fully realistic or keep some things that make it fun. A lot of people praise it for being HARDCORE REALISM when it comes to the weight system but seem to forget the entire medical system which is essentially letting you perform life-saving surgery on yourself and all that.     

Fourth, less reason to go in a raid fully geared if you cannot even get rewarded for doing good in your raid. Cool you killed some people, but hey, you can barely carry their gear and have to crawl to the extract. Most games usually have an awarding feedback when you carry out a hard task, but this one now punishes you instead.      

Curious to see what you think about all of these points, cheers."

They do ban servers that don't follow their ToS and Guidelines but one of the critical flaws they have in their system is that whenever someone deletes a message it's almost instantly gone from their entire infrastructure. This makes getting evidence for reports extremely hard since the person you're reporting can instantly wipe that and your only evidence is no longer taking up space in this realm of existence.     

You complain about Clyde but having a bot reply to tickets first is standard practice across a lot of companies.   

For most other cases I've found them to be generally helpful. As an example my account was banned but after contacting their support I was unbanned (it was an error).  Wait times for a reply are indeed awful but that's because they're a small team.      

In general I agree on some points. I think that a great change would be to not instantly have deleted messages be instantly erased from their servers so that support can review them."

As an example, Discord idling barely uses any considerable amount of CPU. Opening it and rapidly switching between DMs raises the CPU usage to a considerable amount. This exact same behavior is also present while using Discord from Chrome/Firefox.
