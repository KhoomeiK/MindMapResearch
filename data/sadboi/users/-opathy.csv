This is actually my biggest fear. I don't know if I'm supposed to give context but I actually have the memory issue and the neuro told me it's unlikely that it'll noticeably recover. My memory is a little better now I guess, but it still comes and goes. I'm constantly afraid it'll get worse and worse and I just won't realize it."
TwoSentenceHorror,fmgrglm,t1_fmg0eky,1586055872.0,"‚Ä¢ Digital clocks *

If you're wondering, find a digital clock (like stovetop, phone, laptop, etc) and check the time. Ex: 10:42. Look away and look back. If it says 10:42-10:43 you're good, if it says something different that's a big indicator.

‚Ä¢ Lights *

If you turn a light on/off/on and it works fine, you're awake. If it doesn't turn on/off or if it's extremely dim and flickering you're not. 

* Time doesn't exist normally in dreams, so digital clocks don't work and light levels don't change. 


‚Ä¢ Phones/tablets/computers
Usually, if they're not already on, these don't turn on in dreams (which is why there are multiple ways to check a digital clock listed above). If they're already on or do turn on, the clock is a good way to check. 


‚Ä¢ Phones 2.0
Think of someone whose # you know by heart. Try to type it in because you want to call them. Generally you won't be able to type the # properly. 


‚Ä¢ Photos/reflections of yourself
We don't have a solid awareness of what we look like. Our perception changes constantly. So if you can check a reflection or photo if yourself, it should be distorted or blurry if you're dreaming. 


‚Ä¢ Movement 
If you suspect you're not awake try to kick or punch something, or try to run. I find this one only works in nightmares, but as far as I know these movements should be slow and difficult if you're dreaming. 


‚Ä¢ Body
Place your thumb at a 90¬∞ angle to your palm on the opposite hand and push. Your thumb should go through if you're dreaming. 


^ I've had A LOT of issues with this because of psychosis/psychotic episodes. I've learned over time which ones work best to ground myself and sort things out. I use the thumb and phone clock one all the time because it's subtle and easy to do in social situations.

The worst was in 2016 when I was having a REALLY hard time. The clock on my phone just... Disappeared. Lock screen display and across the top. My phone worked fine, notifications were showing up and the device was fully functional... Except for the clock? It was an iPhone and just got weird for a while (like days). I was awake but pretty separated from reality at the time because I was really unwell, so it was really rough. 

There's a debate about whether or not these can be done in a dream but usually if you're able to wonder if you're dreaming you can do at least one or two of those pretty easily. And if you're awake it's obviously totally easy to do them. 

I also carry a small item with me everywhere that I play with when I'm not sure. Mine is my 1 year recovery medallion, which has never been held outside of its case by anyone but me, but it can be anything you're really familiar with. Kind of like that inception movie, haha. 

I hope this helps :)

I am so happy to help, really. I've edited my comment to add a list of some alternative options to AA/NA that are secular. I'm not sure who on this subreddit is/isn't religious or spiritual so I wanted to make sure I added the secular options, especially because I know what it's like to feel like because I don't have a Higher Power maybe I'll fail in recovery.

You never have to thank me for being nice to you and being here for you. I would never leave you or anyone else who needs some support hanging. We all deserve help and support, even if we have a hard time seeing it sometimes.

If you want and are comfortable with it, I would love to be kept up to date on how it's going. Ups and downs, accomplishments, slips (which, again, are not considered a lack of progress!), etc. Absolutely no pressure though, I also understand wanting to focus on recovery as a personal thing.

You ARE strong enough to get through this and kick ass, even if it takes a while and multiple tries. You've got this, I know you do.

I also want to mention that suicide is not a sign of weakness, **but it is NEVER EVER something I encourage or believe is the right choice. There ARE other ways to get through the hard times. The sun WILL rise, I promise. If anyone is feeling like this is the answer, please reach out to your local crisis line or call your equivalent to 911 and get somewhere safe.**

Edit: bold text was missing"
bipolar,fiev3lz,t3_f7sb80,1582382819.0,"Oh boy, I'm sorry this is so long.

I've added a list of a few alternatives to AA/NA and some details at the end of this comment for anyone interested!

I can only speak personally and I don't know if this will help, but... 

For starters, I want to say how intensely proud of you I am for opening up and sharing this. I know it can't be easy, and it's so great that you took this step. 

Now...

I have Bipolar II and I was really unwell for a long time and I didn't know how to fix it because it was all I knew and all I thought I deserved. In 2018 I tried AA and NA, managing to get on the ""right track"" at 24 for 84 days following 2 years of hard using. Before May of 2016 I managed to get away from the hard stuff for 5ish years, but now I'm wondering if it even was that long because I have weird memories of some things. That being said, I drank heavily from 17 - 24. In May of 2018 I relapsed again and it was even worse than before. On August 18 2018 I bailed cold turkey and October 13 of 2018 I quit drinking. 

It was hard. The first while was terrifying. Since then I've been relearning how to live a life without substances and only my prescribed medication while being closely monitored for the ones that are addictive (as in if I try to pick the prescription up more than 2 days early or if I start acting sketchy I'll get flagged in a system kind of monitored). I still have days and nights when I'm miserable and lose my mind, I still struggle a lot with not feeling sick after eating and maintaining a balanced calorie intake, I still wonder if I'm going to slip up and fall back into it. It's still really hard. 

One thing that helped me a lot is something someone told me: ""if you can get through one day, you'll know you can get through two more. If you get through two more, you'll know you can get through four more. Etc"". I think about that all the time. I also use an app called I Am Sober, which gives me notifications every milestone I pass and keeps me motivated. I also repeat the phrase ""just for today"" all the time. I didn't stick to AA or NA because I'm not religious at all and the higher power / forgive those who have wronged me things didn't work for me. But just for today always stuck with me. 

For help programs I know of the Anonymous ones, and there's one that's not religious called S. M. A. R. T , I'm not sure if it covers all substances but I know for sure it covers alcohol. I'll look it up in a second and edit my comment with the full info. I'll also look up a couple more and add those in as well. You don't even have to identify as an addict, you can work on this stuff without it. No one can decide for you whether or not you identify as an addict, that's entirely up to you. 

The most important thing to remember is that it's not easy at all. There will be good days, there will be brutal days, and some days will just be. It's a lot of work and it's so important to not be too hard on yourself for slips and such. Celebrate every milestone. You made it 1 day? Celebrate it by doing something you love. You made it 5? Celebrate it the same way. Etc. If you find it hard to find things you love in the beginning, it's okay to start small. I used to put on a song or playlist I really liked, not because I deprived myself of music, but because it was just something that made me feel lighter.

Another big thing that helped me was to write down things that made me truly happy. For the first bit I always said my dog, Lilymouse. She's 4 lbs, 5 years old, and loves to wear her pyjamas. Over time the list expanded. Some things seem really small to others, like ""today I learned that snails have 4 noses"" (I still don't know if that's a real fact, but it always makes me laugh), or ""I got to sit by the water today"". Some days it's ""today I made my bed!"" or ""today I ate twice"". Others it's ""I finished my book!"" or ""I handed in my assignment!"". Sometimes it's ""I got through today, and that's enough"". 

It doesn't matter how heavy it feels, how low you feel, where you're at in life, what your situation is, how long you've been facing this, where you came from, what you've ""succeeded in"" or ""failed in"". You ARE worthy of recovery, you ARE worthy of healing, you ARE worthy of all the good things in life, you ARE worthy of feeling warm and alive and happy. 

I'm co-writing a safe consumption education and resource program with an addictions and mental health system here, and I've done interviews about addiction and recovery. That's not to show off or anything. It's just to emphasize that I'm open and want you (and anyone else who reads this) to know that if you ever need to talk, please know that I'm here. I'm happy to just listen, I'm happy to answer questions, I'm happy to have a discussion, I'm happy to read about your progress, your slips, your list of things that make you happy, things that make you sad, things that scare you, things you've been through, things you've accomplished, things you want to accomplish... I don't have all the answers, but I've lived a pretty intense life over the last 25 years and I'm happy to be here in any way that I can be, even if It's just over message. 

Also, I'm sorry if my grammar is off. I'm v shaky and I'm not sure I know how to grammar properly, aha.

Edit: added quotation marks for ""right track"" because it makes it sound like dealing with this kind of thing is wrong, which it isn't at all. It doesn't make a person less or weak or anything else that's negative. It's a scary and challenging thing to face, and it's okay to face it. I just hope you know that you really do deserve all the good things, even if it's not always easy to see it.

Edit: some alternative options for recovery programs:

**Here are some options for AA/NA alternatives. I have included a resource that is focused solely on women for those who are more comfortable with that as an option. This is not a complete list by any means, it‚Äôs just a few of the many options available. I fully recommend doing some personal research for your areas as well for in person meetings and things that may only be available in your country of residence, province or state, and city.** 

**Recovery is different for everyone, it means different things for each and every person who wants to try and work on recovery. Recovery is NOT linear, there are ups and downs. None of the downs change or affect your worth as a person or your worthiness of recovery, love, and support.** 

**These options are specifically secular, however WFS Online does encourage meditation and spirituality. This is not a requirement though.**

**SMART Recovery** : Smart management and Recovery Training focuses on empowering the individual to sustain recovery. Also available as **SROL - SMART Recovery Online Community** which includes daily online meetings, message board, and 24/7 live chat. This requires registration, but it‚Äôs free. SMART is not spiritually based, there are no sponsors, and it discourages the use of labels including ‚Äúalcoholic/addict‚Äù, which are all different from Anonymous programs. 

**Women For Sobriety - WFS Online** : Free online abstinence based program of women supporting each other in recovery. There is a screening process, but once approved there is a 24/7 message board and online chat meetings 1-2 times per day. The program is for women aged 18 or older. This one also discourages the use of labels including ‚Äúalcoholic/addict‚Äù. The program is secular, but it does encourage meditation and spirituality. In this program, recovery isn‚Äôt treated as dependent on a Higher Power.

**SOS / Secular Organizations for Sobriety** : Another organization that doesn‚Äôt consider spirituality or surrender to a Higher Power a necessity for the maintenance of abstinence and recovery. Is in an in person program that allows each member to decide whether or not addiction is a disease, where AA/NA puts emphasis on this point. There‚Äôs also clear acceptance that addictive behaviors can be controlled, but never cured. Relapse is always possible. This program does use the terms ‚Äúalcoholic/addict‚Äù. My research shows this one‚Äôs focus is on alcohol, but in my experience it can be applied to both, it‚Äôs just a matter of wording. 

**Personal note on SOS**: *I absolutely believe acknowledgement of relapse possibility is a VERY important thing in recovery. In my experience, It helps understand that a relapse isn‚Äôt a failure on the person in recovery‚Äôs part, these things happen. Progress is progress no matter what, a slip is NOT a fail or a reason to beat oneself down, it‚Äôs a real possibility and it‚Äôs a reason to look back and say ‚Äúyou know what? I‚Äôve made it to __ hours/days/weeks/months/years. Yeah, I slipped, but I know I can get back there and make even more progress.‚Äù It‚Äôs not an excuse or a reason to let oneself take a break from total abstinence (if that‚Äôs the recovery choice that‚Äôs made), but if a relapse does happen, it‚Äôs important to remember that slips do NOT define us in our lives and our worthiness of recovery.* 

**Moderation Management** : I believe this one is also an in person meeting but it does offer private forums and scheduled online chats. There is no charge, but like AA/NA there is the option to offer donations during the meetings. MM offers the choice to start or maintain moderation as opposed to complete abstinence, which focuses on the side of things that are substance abuse as a learned behavior and habit, as opposed to dependence. Moderation is not the right choice for the person in recovery and if a person feels it‚Äôs not the right choice for them, it‚Äôs recommended to move forward with an abstinence based program.

Also: I'm actually really lucky because about 11 months after I got sober my doctor prescribed me Ativan to try and help with some pretty alarming issues. I was given 10x 0.5 mg pills. Over the last 9ish months I've only taken 4 and only in really severe situations. My doctor also had to prescribe another addictive medication 1x/day in the morning because I pretty much stopped being able to function properly and it's really helped. I have appointments every 3 weeks where I have to bring my medication so my doctor can count them and go over some questions with me while making sure I'm not taking more than prescribed, etc. 

I'm really impressed because I needed an early release since I would be out of the country with 4 days of no medication without it. The doctor asked for the itinerary with departure and return dates, the bottle of medication to count a few times, asked a bunch of questions, and I had a reliable witness to discuss my recovery progress with. My doctor increased the dose and allowed the early release, and I offered to return the low dose leftovers to the pharmacy as well.

Do you think it could be something similar?

It knocked me out so fast. I took it and 20 minutes later I was slurring my words and just a mess apparently. I don't drink or anything so my tolerance for anything is so minimal. Eek. 

I think the medication they want me to take for sleep if I have another manic episode is an antipsychotic that I take 1/2 pill for 3 or 4 days. Not quetiapine/seroquel but something else I can't think of the name of. I hate it though, it makes me sleep for hours and I'm pretty much useless for the next 48 hours lmao.

Also, this is going to be really random but be super careful with Ambien. There are stories about people with serious nightmares hurting themselves/others while sleepwalking and stuff, which you might have heard. I took it when I was 19 and would wake up at work with my car keys in my pocket. Ambien is scary stuff.

Edit: I would literally come to at work with my keys in my pocket and the vehicle I drove outside. I mentioned it to my doctor and they doubted it was the cause until I brought in reports of weird/scary things happening to other people. The switched me immediately after that. 

I was also given saphris (sp?) in 2018 during my recovery because I wouldn't sleep more than an hour ish a night after years of heavy addiction (I'd been clean for a while at that point so there was no interaction) and I'd wake up in a perfectly made bed and stuff. They said they never heard of sleepwalking with that med but I stopped taking it anyway. I took it again in the summer of 2019 (once) after a few days of no sleep because of mania and woke up with Lebanese food in my fridge and a charge to my card.

They they pulled it from the DSM-V , which is ridiculous (op! Apparently they put it back into the DSM-V). But yeah, MPD doesn't exist anymore because it was the wrong name for DID. It can be confused with splitting, common in BPD , while going through diagnostic testing. But they're both completely different. Hope this clears it up a bit :)

Edit: also, it sounds like schizophrenia. Typically with DID cases the alters don't communicate with the host this way. Internally they can, but not typically with the host. Definitely not to this degree.  Amnesia is a DID symptom, hallucinations can be (I think), but overall constant communication isn't one of the markers. That's why DID patients are encouraged to journal, etc to try and communicate. 

This honestly just sounds like he's schizophrenic or has BPD with psychotic symptoms, and then being traumatized by what he's doing, but not in a fracturing way. Moreso ""blocking it out"" while associating the occurrence with another person. Especially since being told to do things, etc. is a common theme for schizophrenia. Saying ""he was me all along"" or however it's stated nullifies DID as a possibility.

Something I read (I'm not sure if it's a different area of Muslim religious belief or not) said that ending life support is accepted if 3 (?) professional and trusted medical doctors determine that the person will no longer recover. Is this correct or incorrect? 

I've done a lot of reading from various sources so I want to make sure I get it right."
religion,fdqrjie,t1_fdlwie7,1578673342.0,"Here's a question for you, because I'm genuinely curious:

Would putting someone on life support be going against His plan? I ask this because if there is a plan and the person ends up in a situation where they're deemed in need of life support, would the plan not have been for them to pass away?

Another question:

If I were to be diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, something I have witnessed a person go through, and I were to decide, myself, that I would like to live out the remainder of my capable life doing the best I can, but once the illness starts to take it's toll I would like to be voluntarily euthanized... is that still considered murder? Or is it considered mercy for me?

What I watched was horribly heartbreaking. The person wasn't a person anymore. Their brain functioned, they were breathing, but they were just making ""brain noises"" (sighing sounds, basically). They couldn't respond to anything or anyone, they were just barely alive. Is forcing someone to continue that way, if they've signed the papers for euthanasia, considered more cruel than letting them go?

\--

I don't think euthanasia is widely accepted here, I'd have to look up the laws. I know there are at least 2 places in Canada that allow it with some heavy screening, but I'm not 100% sure of the process or how common it is.

Thanks so much for your time :)

religion,fdqqsv6,t1_fdo4keb,1578672891.0,"For the karma point: Yeah, that's what I was thinking. It's just something I read, not something I think would be the way it goes. This is what the (short form) notes say:

* Helping end a painful life is performing a good deed, therefore fulfilling moral obligations
* Ending a life, regardless of suffering is disturbing the cycle of life and rebirth
   * This is bad to do
   * Person involved will take on the deceased's remaining karma
   * Death is a natural process, it will come in time
* Even the Sannyasin or Sannyasini are permitted to end their lives to reach Moksha

I'm not sure of the terminology, this is just notes I have from my studies. But as a whole, it looks like it's very unsure of what the consensus should be when it comes to euthanasia. I also didn't write the source for this because I've clearly forgotten how to do university in the last 2 years, haha. I really wish I had the source noted so I could go back and re-read it. Ugh.

\--

This makes sense, given all of the varying rules and teachings found in each religion (I've studied around 9 separate ones in the last 9 years, some more in depth than others, but not these ones) it's hard to come to a solid conclusion. Especially since each religion follows the rules provided by the path they take. None is better than the other, but the ideas and rules vary. Sometimes not by a lot, sometimes they're wildly different.

religion,fdnbtlp,t1_fdkpa1q,1578582402.0,"I believe in Hinduism the person who performs the euthanasia or pulls the plug will end up taking the person's remaining karma as well, which I think is a bad thing? 

Also (according to my research and course notes), in Hinduism, one of the requirements for dying ""the good death"" is to be able to say the name of god at the time of death. Life support withdrawal takes that opportunity away from the dying. 

It's super complicated too because there's the fine line between do no harm, and do no harm. Where euthanasia is considered taking a life, but forcing someone to continue to live in fear and agony is also harming them. 

So much to think about and consider, aaaa! It's overwhelming, haha."

\- **For euthanasia:**  Active euthanasia is considered murder, and I understand that in the sense of involuntary euthanasia, such as the death penalty. But is it considered murder if the person were to be, say... diagnosed with terminal brain cancer, is it still murder if they make the decision for euthanasia while they're of sound mind and have decided this to avoid prolonged suffering and pain?   


I ask this because assisted suicide is something that's starting to be considered more often, from what I can tell.  


\- **For ending life support:** I have a connection to a family where tragedy struck (I won't go into details, it's a pretty awful story) and the wife was put on life support following multiple attempts at reconstructing one of her arms, among other things. They ended up ending her life support because there was no way she would ever be able to come back from her injuries. I'm not 100% certain but I believe she breathed on her own for a bit before passing away. Is this considered murder, if the ventilator (I think that's the name) was keeping her alive? Or would it be considered letting nature take it's course because she did breathe on her own at the end?   


**About the morphine:** That's really interesting. I didn't know that but definitely appreciate learning about it.  


**Organ donation:** Okay, so if there is no brain activity but a person's blood is still circulating, they're considered to be alive? And if there is a specific destination for the organ(s) it's a little different than if they're just being harvested for transplant at a later date. Is that correct?"

But then comes the question of what does it mean for the re-incarnation cycle? Because the point is to live life according to the teachings, until you reach the end, and then either move on to enlightenment or re-start the cycle. Ending a person's life early through euthanasia could have some significant consequences, etc. (According to my reading, my personal opinion on euthanasia is not being considered haha)

I've read a whole lot of varying sources including Wikipedia (not this one specifically though, so thank you for reminding me this exists!) and scholarly journals and stuff, but I feel like talking to real people about it will also be really beneficial because it's good to learn from people as well as reading material. At least that's how I feel, haha.

Especially since there's a number of things, including personal opinion, that isn't super available through the sources I've been given. It's easier to learn from talking/messaging about it rather than going through hundreds of pages of readings alone.

The topic isn't only limited to euthanasia as well, so having the chance to discuss the other things like organ donation is a big  help too.
