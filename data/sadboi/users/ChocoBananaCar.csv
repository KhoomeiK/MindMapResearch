AskMenAdvice,fpnpz1h,t3_ge6lrl,1588769983.0,"I’m quite introverted myself.... and I adore my partner like crazy. I can imagine the future with him and he’s completely different to anyone I’ve met before, and we plan on getting engaged. Can not describe how I feel about him.

But even I, sometimes just want to recharge and be on my own. You know? Like sometimes I really do want to see him but I don’t feel like I could give him my full energy and might come across as aloof when I’m not trying to be.

Even then - your feelings are valid too! I don’t doubt how he feels about you at all. It sounds like you’ve both got something good. If I were you I’d open up about it. Just how you feel when he’s quiet, but of course acknowledging what he does do that you like. And just have a think - what would you like him to do differently? Just one small thing that will make you feel good if he did it. Affirming how he feels about you often? Mid-day text? Catching up on your day even if it’s for 15mins of texting? Setting a specific time you guys can FaceTime for a while so he is prepared for that scheduled time? 

I hope this helps! I think you’ve got a good guy."
enfj,fma7f4n,t3_ftdeg2,1585885767.0,"INFP in a relationship with an ENFJ and one thing I noticed is that we seem to have moments where..... we miscommunicate because we are both too nice and considerate of each other’s time/space. One time he didn’t want to get in my space and was busy waiting on me and I didn’t realise because I was waiting on him. Silly misunderstanding that could have been resolved by just talking.

One thing that helped ALOT.... was just airing it out. How I feel when he’s a little quiet than usual.... how I interpret it... and how I don’t want to seem needy or complaining so I don’t say anything. But I say it’s bothering me and this is what’s on my mind. Then he opens up too about the same things.

And just being open and talking about these things helps clear misunderstandings between us... makes me understand his thought process better.

AnxiousAttachment,flwwdgm,t3_fr9vj9,1585567747.0,"Hey.... my partner was doing the same last week. Quiet than usual..... it sent me down a spiral!

Then later there was a misunderstanding between us which only made me feel like it “confirmed” my fears. Only to later realise I misunderstood him.

Then I opened up. Totally opened up... I said he had been quiet than usual and it made me really anxious and overthink. I told him I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to seem needy or like I’m complaining. I said also sometimes when he goes quiet I feel scared that he doesn’t want me anymore or isn’t interested. It was so hard to finally open up - but you know what? I’m so glad I did. Because if I didn’t I feel like I would have self sabotaged this relationship.

He was so reassuring. And opened up too. It only made us feel closer to each other and reaffirmed how we feel about one another. It built more of a deepness. That’s how you know you’ve got the right person.

I think when we get anxious it’s because we are self-protecting and bracing ourselves for the “inevitable” of being abandoned. This becomes an issue when it becomes self destructive and the only way we can build our relationship, and create that true intimacy is by opening up. And seeing if our partner is going to be kind/reassuring or dismissive.

Your needs are important too. Don’t worry I’m learning as well. I hope you can find this courage and create a deeper bond with your partner! He may not even realise what he’s doing. Mine didn’t realise!"

enfj,fl35hx2,t3_fm70t0,1584769510.0,"ENFJ guy I’m talking to seems to really like it when I show obvious interest. But I only do because it’s mutual. Otherwise my fragile heart is out, which I told him from the start.

As far as showing interest I don’t always do it in words really. It’s those gestures and expressions that he picks up on and appreciates. ENFJs are super observant in my experience. I also once in a while talk from my heart about how I feel about us. Which he also likes. Some things I do:

1) Sometimes I just end up staring at him and smiling  ‘warmly’ when he says something that touches me.... like when it seems our values align..... or when I notice a quality of his that just melts me...... then we end up just looking at each other and smiling
2) I don’t want to hang up even when we’ve spoken hours and he sees I’m falling asleep, he seems to be flattered that I still want to keep talking when I’m half dead
3) He seems to like it when I share pictures of what I’m doing, if I cooked something or made something.... and encourages it. And notices when I don’t.
4) I guess asking his thoughts and opinions and how he feels about certain things - to understand him better .... deeper talk is a sign of interest I guess

Speaking of corona..... Our relationship progress has slowed down due to corona travel restrictions, but I guess it’s kind of forced us to slow down and talk aloooooooot through video chat hours at a time. So I guess our bond is deeper through that... and we are learning about each other (our attitudes/beliefs/values/opinions). 

Background: I’ve made my intentions super obvious even from the start what is a deal breaker to me (someone unavailable, someone not in it for the long haul, or unclear of their intentions). This helps clarify things on the long-term plan, otherwise it seems useless to keep talking or showing interest (well to both of us)."

2) Very straight forward about what they want
3) Quite masculine and have this... dominant kind of presence? .... I love it because they’ve got this soft centre to balance it out
4) Very easy-going and talkative but also have this serious kind of side to them
5) Highly observant of peoples expressions or actions around them
6) If you ask a question they’ll take it fully and seem to always have an answer on the spot?
7) Quite physically affectionate

ENTP men - I can see why people would like them but I can’t get past the shallow stage of knowing them. They just like to troll a bit too much for my liking when they get too friendly with you. So i keep a distance since we get along best with the distance. 

When they’re too friendly it’s like an annoying fly noise in my ear and I don’t have the energy to engage in their weird playful arguments. It’s a game to you ENTP, but I find it uncomfortable/weird and annoying. Otherwise they seem alright.... I guess, they can be quite nice and helpful. It’s just that troll trait I can’t stand."
mbti,fjp4aw6,t3_feh79p,1583541481.0,"ISTPs and ENFJs..... it seems, since I end up drawn to these people and vice versa.

Long term I get bored because I need that deeper connection, and I need long-term planning in my relationship.

ENFJs - I’ve met unhealthy ones and I’m currently with a healthy one. The chemistry from the start tends to be so instantaneous. We can talk about ANYTHING ... and my randomness is welcomed. I’d like to focus on the healthy one - I’ve never in my life felt this secure, connected and close to a guy before. And each day it only gets better. It’s like you’re both super empathetic and open.

General rules are:
1) No idea is too unoriginal, bad or useless.....
2) Make a random idea using previous rule.....
3) Build on random idea.....
4) Keep building random thoughts/ideas
5) Look at all ideas I came up with - and see if there’s a way somehow I can mix and match them to come up with something totally different......

When you’re coming up with ideas look at the internet or just sit and doodle random thoughts in your head.

The most important thing is to treat your brain like a playground. Be a little kid who doesn’t judge their own thoughts but just goes with it.

ONE
Figure out through chat if you’re actually compatible i.e: Religion wise, future goals wise, values wise, family wise, intentions of marriage wise.... just the basic foundations

TWO
If the general foundation seems good I move to a video chat rather than meeting in person. A lot of guys tend to be one way through chat and another in person. For example some seemed really polite and serious over chat but face-to-face were so inappropriate because they were unfiltered. Other guys were just plain creepy even though they seemed smart/normal over chat.

I thank Allah I didn’t waste a large part of my day making plans, I’d have felt so uncomfortable if I met these guys in person.

You’ll be fine, in fact it will be the best approach. You’ll get a peace of mind and an answer and that’s all you need.

Worst case he doesn’t feel the same. But I find ISTPs will want to remain friends if you’re cool with it. In my experience. I recently confessed to one, and we back to normal already, accept now I don’t have to second guess his sweetness. My mind is at rest, I can talk to other guys and not feel guilty or feel like I’m giving up on him.

Best case - he likes you back and you guys can be all lovey dovey yay and you don’t have to mentally torture yourself about this anymore.

Even if I do ask someone for advice, I ask for advice from multiple people and weigh it all up anyway. Not one person can solve something, multiple perspectives is my way to go. The one I appreciate most is the one who supports me. The one who will just hug me, hold me, listen without judgement, is just there for me, and if I need their input I’ll ask. I think I’ll be more open to their input if they put all the effort to hear me out and empathise before jumping to solutions.

I hope that gives some kind of insight into the other side of the story. 

I always think this - you ISTPs are so soft at your core, well the ISTP males I’ve known have been.

I personally don’t care because to me, protecting not just myself but also others is self respect. But as soon as someone says something I find offensive or annoying, I tell them right away. Not aggressively, I’ll just say “not cool”, or “wow really?”.. and if they keep going I tell them to shut up and they don’t have to be rude. Because at that point they’ve crossed a clear line. When they know they’ve pissed you/someone else off and still keep going, it means they need to stop. If they don’t stop it means they’re being selfish/rude.

I know this comes more naturally to some more than others. But I really hope you don’t let your “friend” keep walking all over you. That’s not a friend worth keeping. You deserve better."
istp,f0v3p73,t1_f0v1or1,1568962020.0,"Hmmm interesting... 

I mean for me personally if someone misunderstood me, I’d try to understand why what I did could be misinterpreted. And then I’d attempt to fix the relationship. 

However if we don’t come to an understanding only then I’d let go back.

If that other person doesn’t explain why they left, I won’t chase either. Only if they address the issue would I try to fix it."
istp,f0v2bum,t1_f0v29md,1568960116.0,"What the hell...... that’s not a friend. Tell her she’s being rude. It’s not called being butt hurt it’s called having self respect.

Cut her out... what a moron."
istp,f0s1oli,t1_f0ryzlq,1568897208.0,"Makes sense, thank you for bringing this perspective to my attention. I genuinely thought he was putting up an act that he doesn’t care."
istp,f0s1hjz,t1_f0rxs6h,1568897104.0,"Makes sense... especially the part about how some ISTPs might reason that someone doesn’t care for them.
I remember once I remembered something significant in his life that was meant to happen on a certain day (3 weeks later).

I reached out to him on the day and he was happy/shocked I remembered.
Meanwhile I’m confused as to why exactly that’s shocking. I’m always aware of important things in my friends/family’s lives.
Then I realised he probably thinks I don’t care... then my heart felt sad for him."
istp,f0rw8n8,t1_f0rufgx,1568894185.0,"That’s good to know. He does put a lot of effort I guess.

What if someone leaves because they misunderstood your actions? Would you try to explain yourself? Or just be like “ok bye”"
istp,f0rvmzc,t1_f0ruyk0,1568893835.0,"No I’m not upset. Last year I was upset and left for that reason. 

But second time around I got to know him for him and realised he does put effort in his own way. Like being helpful/advising... always responding to me and never leaving me hanging. Never judging me. And I always feel happy to just be myself around him. What more can a friend ask for?

I just worry about him, that he will end up lonely due to his behaviour. Others won’t understand it and will be hurt, and in turn hurt him when they leave. He can lose people from his life that care about him."
sydney,f0rs3ls,t1_f0rod6b,1568891574.0,"That’s good to hear. That it would be a dream to someone from Brisbane haha.

Is the trains breaking down just a recent issue?"
sydney,f0rruzk,t1_f0rrjhi,1568891424.0,"Yeah, still there’s rarely any delays on my train line. And even when there is - it’s not 1hr, maybe 10mins in my experience.

That’s why I was a bit surprised to hear about Sydney as I thought it would be much more smoothly running.

Sunset ferry rides to sound great though haha."
MuslimMarriage,f0rl0an,t3_d62hzu,1568886386.0,"I don’t think you should tell him. If he wanted to be with you, he would have tried to be with you.

And for as long as you keep talking to him, you’ll never be able to clear him out your system. 

It will take a while to re-wire your brain especially if everyday you ultra-focused on why you like him. Take time away from him, focus on yourself. If you’re not ready to move on, no amount of guys you meet will fill that void in you. You’ll keep comparing them to him.

Only thing that will heal that is time, self-love, self-care and self-improvement. 

One day you’ll find someone, it might seem an idea out of reach, but many have been in your position before, many have moved on.

I’ll just say one thing for sure - sticking around won’t help."
infp,f0o9jy4,t1_f0nw4sx,1568802968.0,Yeah they actually do feel bad when they know they’ve crossed a line. They can be abrupt and rude sometimes but they do care.
infp,f0nnj72,t3_d5pgb6,1568774873.0,"I find ESTJs tend to bitch and whine about everyone. So I just wouldn’t take their comments seriously. Same with ISTJs, though I get along with them better."
istp,f0mu3xb,t1_f0lmt00,1568753191.0,"Well if she continues while knowing it upsets you, you’ve got every right to set boundaries on how you’re treated. That’s very immature of her."
istp,f0lemm3,t3_d5ejm0,1568714120.0,Do you think she was being passive aggressive or just trolling?
infp,f0leeub,t3_d5bkzz,1568713764.0,When I watch interviews of her I see the INFP oozing out
MuslimMarriage,f0ldka4,t1_f0lbkrb,1568712329.0,Maybe stuff with Arabic calligraphy? Please clarify OP
istp,f0ldaqa,t3_d5d4pp,1568711867.0,"Sounds like a horrible partner/dad... but I wouldn’t just sum it up to him being an ISTP.

I know ISTPs who are great dads and partners."
MuslimMarriage,f0hnp6h,t1_f0ejs0p,1568626614.0,That’s some weird waste of time behaviour on her part.... I hope you find someone that isn’t so socially retarded......
Izlam,f0d0spe,t1_f0cv2o3,1568547846.0,"The correct way to reply would be to answer her question, not to take a jab at her. Now she’s going to walk away thinking “religious” people are passive aggressive and don’t like answering questions properly. How does that help her imaan?

In my opinion as a leader of a community, you’ve got a greater responsibility to be tactful than someone who isn’t a leader."
Izlam,f0cufc6,t1_f0cbgsc,1568545427.0,.... sheikhs replying aggressively isn’t a good look.
istp,f0cu101,t1_f0bl9qd,1568545273.0,"I mean if it can come across as being a know-it-all tbh. I think it’s great that y’all wanna help. Just, maybe, be tactful if you actually want people to listen."
istp,f06dnnm,t1_f03meev,1568435526.0,What do you mean by self doubt? Like you need reassurance?
istp,f06dia2,t1_f04yn9t,1568435439.0,Am INFP but I love scheduling things too. Also crossing things off my lists. It helps me reach my goals. Try not to fall too much into MBTI stereotypes.

mbti,ez3qgyb,t3_cpj5k6,1567672985.0,I dunno the ones I’ve met are pretty chill and nice... to me. Like really nice to me. But I’m a softy so who’d be mean to me.
SkincareAddicts,ez3ppw1,t3_czpovn,1567672534.0,Oh man at first glance I didn’t realise it was a mask and thought omg how we gonna fix this one guys.

MuslimMarriage,eyt3dkd,t1_eyt3c2a,1567423109.0,How long did you speak for until you realised who he is?
MuslimMarriage,eyt3c2a,t3_cyky85,1567423054.0,"I don’t know, that seems really weird and immature to be honest. Like, really childish especially for a grown up? But I don’t know we could all be extremely judgey.

But yeah if a man didn’t want to tell me who he is and expected me to talk to him and give him a chance, that’s a big no no."
istp,eyngv6u,t3_cxrcmh,1567247851.0,"Not ISTP,  but what’s exactly special about this guy that makes you stay?"
infp,eyngdwb,t1_eymz84h,1567247367.0,"It’s always worth reaching out. Like don’t expect anything to come out of it. Just say hey how you been? Don’t build it up too much in your head. 

Ignoring it will only make it feel worse. I’ve reached out to friends after ugly fights or simply because we drifted apart. And I’ve never regretted it, whether I got ignored or was faced with their indifference. I don’t regret a single time I reached out. If I didn’t I would have felt worse."
mbti,eyng6kk,t3_cxrpkw,1567247115.0,"Haha and I screw up and the ENTJ will first look at me like what the hell. Then they’ll laugh like “on INFP, just you being you”.....

Tbh when us INFPs practice things a lot, at first we are confused, but once we master something we are super great at it. And we know how to come up with ideas to make it better later on."
infp,eymsify,t3_cxlxyk,1567218603.0,"My younger INFP self would agree with this.

Older INFP self is like... what BS.

If you don’t show up or show people you care, don’t expect them to read your mind and know you’re there for them. That’s not how people work, that’s not how the world works. That’s our low Fe and weak Te (action taking).

Yeah we care a lot, it’s mentally and emotionally taxing. But we need to learn to find a balance. It’s not about being perfect, it’s about just simply showing up some times. But don’t worry, the more self-aware you are the more you’ll learn as you grow up."
istp,eygiq9v,t3_cwq39n,1567070446.0,"I’d describe my conversations with my ISTP friend like... me leading the conversation in absolutely any direction and him mostly just passing commentary on what I said. But he never ever takes the lead. Ever. Which I don’t mind, i like steering the ship.

Sometimes I wonder if I’m bothering him but as long as he is responsive imma just keep talking."
