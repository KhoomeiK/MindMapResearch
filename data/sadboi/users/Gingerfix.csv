bipolar,forhv05,t3_g93xtc,1588012496.0,"I was a CIA sleeper agent. All of my past sexual encounters were either CIA handlers or enemy agents. One of my exes had been trying to set me up with appropriate handlers from a distance by manipulating my tinder activity. My work was a CIA front for sending messages through DNA molecules, and that’s why the purity of the molecules didn’t matter and I was only there to occupy a space and make the company look legitimate. My department investigated scenes for clues but I wasn’t initiated yet and my current boyfriend/coworker’s department did the heavy work.

I had recently uncovered a massive illegal cannabis network and was afraid they would come after me and that the cartel would come after me.

When I got to the hospital, I was being monitored and filmed live on YouTube. All of my actions and words were being monitored by the CIA and my ex. 

My boyfriend’s brother was also in the CIA and that’s why his ID was on the counter. 

Also my ex had flown all the way to where I live to check on me but I refused to see him in case he was identified by double agents.

And there was a listening device implanted in my dog and they had just told me it was from her spay surgery but it wasn’t because I would have noticed it before moving across country if that were true.

Also a bunch of people had been shot in my boyfriend’s brother’s back yard by my boyfriend’s brother shortly before we left for the hospital.

Also my dad was actually alive and had come to the hospital to help me escape so that the security guards wouldn’t kill me.

And the nurse was a different ex in disguise."

I felt safe at the hospital they transferred me to. I was in the emergency department for around ten hours and for seven of those hours I thought I was going to either die or have to go into hiding and maybe never see my family or friends ever again and one of the nurses was great but it was just I had no history of mental illness on my record besides depression so everyone was blindsided and probably thought I was on drugs. I peed in 3-5 of the pee cups to prove “system suitability,” which I won’t even get into unless asked.

Basically when it’s the staff’s job to treat you well, they do. When it’s just their job to monitor you, it’s hell.

It was expensive but worth it for me, though no one ever explained what was happening to me. I’m afraid of being hospitalized again because of the cost, and I don’t know if it would do me as much good the second time."

It’s more that pharmaceuticals get funded as if they will find a cure when most of the time they won’t. To fund Pharma properly you have to analyze whether the money would be better spent somewhere else and if alleviating cancer symptoms or saving lives is worth it. 

Sometimes it is and sometimes it isn’t and most people aren’t willing to attach dollar value to a life.
