femalefashionadvice,fodenng,t3_g6t7zb,1587683741.0,"Dress Pants Yoga Pants (from https://www.betabrand.com/)! They are stretchy and comfy like yoga pants but look dressy enough for work or play. My weight fluctuates +/- 10lbs every year and these have been holding steady.  Also, over the years I've realized I need to hold onto my ""fat pants"" and my ""skinny pants"" and just go back and forth as needed.  If I buy something expensive like a suit, I will buy the pants/skirt in 2 sizes and keep both to accommodate my weight changes.  I tend to gain most of my weight in the bottom (pear shape) so I rarely need to change top sizes. Lastly, I usually try to do more of my shopping when I'm larger (which is the opposite of what our natural urge is) as you can always have clothes taken in if you lose weight."
aww,fmcdr5m,t3_fu8p97,1585943716.0,You might want to see a vet. Those eyes could be a symptom of hyperthyroidism.
SuicideWatch,flubu1j,t3_fqtx8q,1585499484.0,"This really hit the nail on the head.  Knowing that I can never achieve the greatness that I thought I was capable of as a child makes me question the point of living at all. Perhaps it’s the bad side of perfectionism. Perhaps I was delusional, believing the lie society tells us when we are young - “you can do or be anything”.  That hope (or comfort) in your future is what makes us able to enjoy the little things in life and live in the present moment. Knowing that all those doors are now closed is painful and I’m not sure if we ever stop grieving over that. 

On a side notes, I’ve noticed in this pandemic I’m much better able to live in the moment. All the pressure of doing something great is taken off of me (for the time being) because the world is shut down anyway. I’m now able to enjoy some morning sun or a cup of coffee with a sense of peace for the first time in years."

depression_help,fklh3q5,t3_fj5n1f,1584306170.0,Most pharmacies will give you a 2-3 day supply in these emergency situations to cover you until you get an rx.
SuicideWatch,fj1u22g,t1_fj1981s,1582927770.0,Me too! It’s a struggle to make sense of a silly 9-5 job. That’s the real struggle of the modern world.
SuicideWatch,fj1tx08,t1_fj0p82w,1582927680.0,"I’ve felt similarly and for me, it ended up being a sign that I was heading down the wrong career path. It might be your “gut” trying to tell you that it’s time for a change. Yes, working can be a drain but there are things you can do that make you actually like working. The great news is you are young so you have time to try some different things and find a job you actually like doing. Even just sitting with a therapist and making a plan or goals can help with the depression."
SuicideWatch,fh23c92,t3_f0xfqt,1581233342.0,"I want to say something helpful and meaningful but I feel defeated in just hearing about everything you went through so I can’t imagine having lived it.  The fact that you are still here to write this post speaks volumes about your strength and character. There are many that wouldn’t have made it this far. I also suffer from severe depression and social anxiety and have suicidal thoughts almost daily, but I feel ridiculous after hearing your story. It truly causes me pain that people suffer like this. 

You are an incredibly strong and resilient person. You were dealt a shit hand but you have made some significant progress so don’t overlook that. You now have a roof over your head and a steady income of some sort. That’s not nothing. 

Know you have value and you deserve some joy in this life. Like others have said you clearly have good writing skills. You touched many of us tonight. Share your story with more people. Share your survival story. Teach us how to become that resilient, because honestly, I need some of that myself.

I know you must be lonely but know you are not alone.  There are lots of us real humans who actually care, who are also lonely, and struggling, and terrified and here if you need us."
curlyhair,ffukqgk,t1_ffsuu1n,1580244015.0,"I have been deep conditioning about once a week but perhaps I need to do this every time. Day 1 hair is great but by day 2 it is completely straight in the front (previously 2b). The hard part is that the back/inner layers of my hair are 2c-3a, and the outer layers (crown and nape) are 2a so I basically have to do 2 different routines to different parts of my hair. I'm spending a fortune on products!"
curlyhair,ffg112a,t1_ffftiyn,1579896132.0,I have this issue too - during the winter in particular my hair gets much much straighter then it was in the summer. I wonder if the winter dry air is the cause? Its improved with changing to glycerin-free products on really dry days but still isn't my summer curls.
curlyhair,fd45vvf,t1_fczugaj,1578164678.0,You are hilarious:)
lonely,fc6cgwa,t3_efwwsg,1577477337.0,"Agreed, it’s extremely difficult  to learn to love yourself when you don’t have social support of some kind. Having relationships in some capacity helps because you can get feedback and reassurance. That’s why therapy with someone you truly trust, can be useful.  Furthermore, even superficial relationships can provide some value. 

I try to remember there are people out there who will love me despite not being the best version of myself, it just takes some effort to find them. Doing the bare minimum like good hygiene, clean clothes, and being polite goes a long way to make someone welcoming to other people. The other stuff, like eating healthier, improving social skills, becoming happier, loving yourself,  obviously take much longer and while they will help your chances at finding love, are not absolutely essential to having relationships (of any kind).  There are plenty of people out there in relationships who don’t love themselves. 

Likewise, for many of us the loneliness may not go away completely regardless of whether we are alone or not, and I feel like that may be the depression itself.  Continually working to improve and coming back to a place a hope whenever possible is the only way to combat that in my opinion. That, and a good psychiatrist of course."
curlyhair,fbzlw0v,t1_fby8j45,1577251150.0,I had an issue with stringy curls (particularly on day 2 hair) for a long time. I finally solved it by adding more water to my hair after applying my products and doing squish to condish. Im still trying to perfect my technique but it’s helped a lot.

raisedbynarcissists,fbx2sz9,t1_fbv5z2v,1577167093.0,"I like this, thank you for sharing. I’ve struggled to make a relationship stick, or even friendships for that matter, because some people get overwhelmed by my issues. But I agree that relationships are not the place to work out all your childhood trauma. I’m still struggling to find the balance between being “open” and not making people feel drained."
raisedbynarcissists,fbx2e2s,t1_fbwvr0e,1577166651.0, I know that feeling well and have gotten sucked into many depressive spirals because of it. But of course you deserve all those good things. Don’t listen to that critical voice inside - that’s the voice of the abuser and the scars they left on your psyche.  We all deserve love and there has to be someone out there for all of us if we look hard enough. Don’t give up.
MakeupAddiction,fbit9ps,t3_ed328e,1576913222.0,What products are you using in your hair? It’s so soft but still defined and not frizzy. Gorgeous!
lonely,fbh55z4,t3_ed3f0j,1576865547.0,Thanks. Yeah for women especially. We have to fight to be taken seriously regardless of how we look.  If we don’t satisfy society expectations of femaleness we get called names. If we use our looks to our advantage we also get called names. You see it all over the political process.
lonely,fbfsrss,t3_ed0mx2,1576819768.0,"I know it’s cliche but you are 19 and have so much life ahead of you. Your frontal lobe hasn’t even finished forming yet. Get into therapy and social anxiety groups and start working on your social skills, your coping skills, and self esteem. There is still time to fix things before your worries become true. I’m twice your age and feel the same. And let me tell you, it’s a whole different ballgame at 38. Don’t give up now when you haven’t even started yet. You still have time to avoid your worst fears if you play your cards right."
lonely,fbfsb8c,t3_ed3f0j,1576819333.0,"I feel your pain. I’m not gorgeous but I have struggled making friends because I grew up with all brothers and get along better with men. But men can’t seem to be “just friends” with attractive women. I also lost a whole social group because a girl was jealous of my platonic friendship with her boyfriend. Now I have no friends, no family, no close relationships. While I obviously cannot blame just my looks, it certainly hasn’t helped me."
lonely,fbfr7yu,t3_ecpqo4,1576818305.0,"I felt that way for much of my youth. I tested the waters by putting less effort into the friendships and it turned out that I was right. They all disappeared. I was right, but the sad part is that I lost all of my friends. I’d give anything to be that disposable friend again because at least then I wouldn’t be alone all the time."
lonely,fbfqpb3,t3_ed0zdy,1576817831.0,"I feel similarly.  I have no close relationships - friends, family, or anyone else.  All my old friends left me because I either messed it up or was too depressed to be a good friend. I do work but the people I work with don’t like me and I don’t blame them. 

For what it’s worth I feel just a little bit less lonely after reading your posts. For all of our sakes, I hope we eventually find our way out of this trap. I for one, if given the opportunity will never take a friend for granted again. If you have family still, try to find some solace in the fact that you are not completely alone."
StudentLoanSupport,fbfkxbq,t3_djz69q,1576813107.0,I’m late to this but if it’s not too late try to do everything you can to avoid private loans. Federal loans can be forgiven in a loan forgiveness program but private loans cannot.
nursepractitioner,fber2ug,t1_f9xmkmg,1576791966.0,Look for programs with good preceptorship connections. That is the most important thing.
nursepractitioner,fbeqr7s,t1_f9cm5mv,1576791754.0,Yes I hate being an NP. I’m on my 4th job in 6 years and it’s at a fairly good academic center in a specialty. I have good pay but I’m still treated like dirt by all levels of staff and living paycheck to paycheck due to student loans.  I can’t even work as a regular nurse because I have no experience in that. I’m so trapped at this point I don’t see an out besides bailing on health care completely and living in poverty while paying back 2k/month in loans. I sacrificed everything for this career and feel like I threw my life away.
minimalism,fbcge3b,t1_fbbs7qf,1576723266.0,Love this. One year my mom went through all the old pictures of me and my brothers and made us each a picture book of our childhood. Something thoughtful like that would be lovely.
dating_advice,fb2u5ep,t1_favz1yb,1576457746.0,"There are tons of us “boring” women out there, even on dating apps. Look for those with demanding jobs (nurses are great) and chances are they are too tired to go mountain climbing or hiking every weekend. Also, know that people embellish on dating apps and are never as exciting as they appear. I personally feel like I have to make myself sound more exciting than I am or I wont get dates. But perhaps that’s a terrible strategy."
dating_advice,fb2s1ni,t3_eb4pe2,1576456650.0,"Ugh it’s hard to hear that women can be like this but I hear it all too often. I personally feel that if a girl isn’t at least offering to split the bill she’s either not that into you or not a very nice person.  I always offer and while I realize there are more “traditional” girls out there, smart ones should realize that in this dating culture no good man should have to pay for all the dates. Of course, if you are not so interested in quality and just want to have a good time, then be aware you are rolling the dice. Also take into account the fact that most women have had that exact same thing happen to them with respect to sex (a man disappears right after sex), so may think their behavior is justified."
nursepractitioner,fb2ps69,t3_eatp0f,1576455452.0,I was personally scammed out of $500 by one of those pay websites about 6 years ago so I would probably not recommend it. Sorry I know the predicament you are in sucks and it is a huge problem that undermines the success of students in NP schools in general. Try to find private practice physicians or NPS if you can as they have the most freedom to do this. Also join any networks you can and go to meetings to meet people. Good luck!
ForeverAlone,f8anm9l,t3_dzp9t2,1574403352.0,"Don’t give up.  I was feeling that way for about 20 years and am just now starting to find hope. I was on so many medications and in and out of therapy forever. I lost all my friends because of the depression and thought I would never stop spiraling downwards. I finally found out about and completed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and for the first time in my life I don’t feel that constant emptiness anymore. My social anxiety is almost gone. I am nowhere near where I want to be but I finally have some hope.  I’m more confident and people are finally starting to talk to me again. I have at least 1 friend now and am hopefully I can make more. Please don’t give up. Look into TMS, it’s a lifesaver. Literally."
