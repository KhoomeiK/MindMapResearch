I prefer glass as it's cleanest and tastes good. But joints are good. Take a rolling paper roll it up on a pen and then slowly stuff weed into it and pack it down so that it's squishy but firm. Or one hitters are at every smoke shop. Pipes are good but harsh so if ur new stay with filtered stuff. especially if u want to do a lot.

Get some incense and tell your parents you like the smell when you're showering. 
You will need at least an hour to air out the bathroom and only use glass. Paper will never leave. 

I used the incense in the bathroom to make sure the smoke wasn't getting pulled out the door vents (with the bathroom fan on) 
With the bathroom fan on creates negative pressure in the bathroom. Just make sure to blow the smoke into the fan."

Then wake up extra early and drink as much as possible and add an additive for color. 
I don't know what it's called but have seen it used twice both working. But they were athletic men in their 20's. I've got a lil chub myself and think I'm going to try it. 
Get a box of home pee strips and test every day see if the connection goes down or up. 

I've long wondered if you gained a lot of weight (with daily use). Stopped  smoking and held the weight for a month to allow your tolerance to regain. Then head to the gym for an awesome workout high ;)
