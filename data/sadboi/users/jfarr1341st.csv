BipolarReddit,f9tncul,t3_e5ka62,1575633159.0,"Update, went to a marrage counselor and found out my therapist is crazy, does mostly work for the state determining court requirements for metal health, not therapy. Well guess it's not to bad I only went three times. I wondered why I felt worse after leaving, he seemed to want to push my buttons then turn me loose. lol thank you everyone for your input, I might have stayed and got nowhere"

survivinginfidelity,f9o5dxw,t3_e65lew,1575496847.0,"Why? Ghost him, he sat a screwed with you for the interaction, the more you interact the more he wins because you are thinking of him. Not worth your effort. Put that energy into making your life better. Good luck."

I agree people change but not without a cause to change. I hope I can look back and see clearly what did happen and forgive."
survivinginfidelity,f9ntues,t3_e645ww,1575490579.0,"Man, how crazy is that, you got away from her and became the person she loved. My question is why were you not that person while she was there? Did the relationship make you less attractive because she had You? I ask because I'm doing the same thing and think a separation still gives them hope that you will be there and does not force them to change the behavior that caused it. Plus if she did it once and was nice till she got caught how do you know she being honest and real? Can't ask them."

survivinginfidelity,f9n8d39,t3_e61oo3,1575479191.0,"You are not dumb, you chose to trust and love someone not capable of loving anyone that they can't use to their benefit. Stop the madness, stop being afraid to live alone. If you spouse passed away, you wouldn't have that choice to live alone, and you would make it. I sometimes feel I can't live without her, but if she left, she could happily live without me and she's nothing compared to me after cheating, I still have my pride, and respect for myself, I did not cheat, and making the decision to take control over my life. Thank you for your post. I hope you find peace in knowing your better than that and you child will love you for standing up for yourself more than if they watch you get walked all over. Believe me I know. Best of luck."
