sleep,euc7g4m,t3_cfrxnl,1563667157.0,"Anything can be a factor when it comes to fatigue and tiredness. Depression, anxiety, stress, some sort of vitamin deficiency, poor diet, lack of exercise, etc.

First piece of advice that comes to my mind is taking a 30 minute walk in the evening, a nice warm shower, and a natural sleep-aid like Unisom - unless you're on any medication that shouldn't be taken with sleep medication, ask your doctor.


Take it about 30-40 minutes before you plan to go to bed. Since you're used to going to bed so late, I'd recommend taking the (recommended) dosage around 10 pm that way it's not a drastic change from your usual pattern. From personal experience if taken too early - your mind and body may try to fight it, especially if you've slept in late that day. Exercise, even a simple 30 minute walk, during the day can really help your mind and body when it comes to shutting down for the night."

Try not to let them dictate how you feel. I know how hard it is to feel comfortable it your own skin, especially in the public eye. Just remember you're giving others your own criticism when you say what you believe they're thinking (I hope that was comprehensive, haha!) they have their own issues they're battling. We all have our own flaws and insecurities. I believe 9/10 times no one is thinking what we think they're thinking. Don't give strangers a voice in your mind.


If anyone ever says anything negative directly to you, they're the ones that really have issues, deep issues.

Most of the time I live in a haze, floating through the days. Sometimes I don't even think this is my life, it's like I'm just watching a show and I can't stop, pause, or rewind. Life is just happening and I'm just in a dreamland watching other people passing me, watching the days pass, watching my life pass. It's a strange feeling when you don't feel human.

At least you found out you can't trust them. You should be able to go to the sign in page and click a password reset button. If your number is linked with it, it should have an option to have a code sent through text, or through email if not. I don't understand how Sony can say there's not enough proof though.

Most of my co-workers and I get along fine, but every now and then one of the co-workers will snap on me, about dumb stuff. The very next day and this co-worker will turn around and vent to me about the rest of the workers and management, always has something to say about someone, but won't ever admit fault in anything. I truly believe this co-worker has undiagnosed mental health issues, because this person completely lashes out if things don't go exactly her way."
