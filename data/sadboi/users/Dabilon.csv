Which reminds me of,  The other day I decided to visit the local movie theater. Other than being a connoisseur of film, I visited the locale theater due to the fact they were screening a personal favorite of mine. Pixar‚Äôs Cars 2. There aren‚Äôt many words needed to describe the absolute masterpiece of the film, so I‚Äôll continue my story. I made sure to park my bright and shining golden brown Toyota Prius right in the front of the parking lot, so the masses could bask in its glorious light. I made sure to bring my own snacks, of course, my free-thinking mind had already broken the chains called capitalism a long time ago. I smirked as I saw the ignorant cretins buy the overpriced and disgusting popcorn, and pitied them. After all, with my IQ, everybody is basically a monkey. The movie had been out for quite some time, so I had the theater to myself. Or so I thought. Right when I had my premium Ass Warmer Ultra tm. With ass scratching capabilities and began feasting on the glorious food called canned baked beans a group of youths of African American descent entered the theater. I froze for a second, as I had planned on being alone but I could adjust my plans. I decided to continue my movie experience. After all, the beautiful face of Mater could surely distract me from their hooliganism. We were in the best part, a truly masterful comedic technique used in the movie. Where Mater mistakes the ethnic Japanese food ‚ÄúWasabi‚Äù for ‚ÄúPistachio‚Äù flavored ice cream. This is quite comedic due to them looking very similar but have quite different tastes. I allowed myself to chuckle at this execution before realizing one of the youths was staring at me. I ignored him and began using my can opener to partake in the act of baked bean eating. Then I heard him about it. ‚ÄúYO THIS NIBBA EATING BAKED BEANS WHILE WATCHING CARS 2‚Äù"

 To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Hopsin. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of Asian massage parlors most of the jokes will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Hopsin's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterization - his personal philosophy draws heavily from nihilistic literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Hopsin truly ARE idiots- of course, they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humor in Hopsin's existential catchphrase ""Your boy Hop goes hard like some cold nipples,"" which itself is a cryptic reference to how nipples go hard when they get cold. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those adulated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Marcus Hopson's genius unfolds itself into their pathetic ears. What fools... how I pity them. üòÇ And yes, by the way, I DO have a Hopsin tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
