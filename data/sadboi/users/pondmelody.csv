EngagementRings,fjd524f,t1_fjcboq9,1583245828.0,"thanks!! So my ring is from Brilliant Earth and they literally take forever, haha. It took 2.5 weeks, and the estimate they gave me was 2-3 weeks. I think it's because they send all rings to Colorado to be resized."
weddingplanning,fh8bsil,t1_fh8bl9b,1581356381.0,"Yeah, that's what my fiance is afraid of. No one can convince me not to marry him, he's the love of my life, but I will be hopping mad if they think they can try or try to make the wedding about them."
weddingplanning,fh87hxw,t1_fh86leh,1581353724.0,"Yeah the other thing is they want to ""talk in person"" about my wedding plans and I haven't given them an answer about that (I said I'd get back to them) and it's been a month. The problem there is I have a hard time standing up for myself around them because I get emotionally flooded and confused. I'm annoyed they even want to talk about my wedding plans given how they aren't even happy I'm engaged and my dad hasn't spoken to me in over a year."
weddingplanning,fh86mxq,t3_f1svcv,1581353188.0,ALSO should add I'm not 100% positive my parents won't be cold and judgmental and/or nasty to me at my wedding because they are VERY emotionally immature and have not honored boundaries I've set in the past. I do NOT want to have to deal with that at my wedding. So that's the other risk factor at play here.
EngagementRings,fg1i3cm,t1_fg1c74w,1580427505.0,"Hey I get it, I’m paranoid too! Honestly still slightly paranoid about the ring size, haha. And yes! My ring insurance is only $50/year and it covers the entire cost of the ring, so if literally anything happens to it, the insurance will cover any fixes/replacements, even if I lose the entire ring! It’s definitely worth the $50 per year, it brings a lot of peace of mind."
EngagementRings,fg0wz87,t1_fg0m73y,1580416665.0,"Oh weird, I hadn’t seen any reviews saying that! I mean, I think they are, but I’ve only had the ring for a month so idk exactly how it’ll hold up long term.  I certainly HOPE they don’t fall out, but my ring is also insured so I’d be able to get anything fixed/replaced at no cost if anything does happen."
EngagementRings,fg09mr0,t1_fg09chc,1580403180.0,"I’m actually not 100% sure if I could size mine down to a 4.25, I assume I can because I also have a silver ring that’s a 4.75 that I wear on my right hand (it fits perfectly), but I know sizing also depends on the ring. And yeah! I know exactly what you mean. I think choosing a looser or tighter fit really depends on what you’re comfortable with. As long as the ring isn’t flying off your finger when your hands are cold or wet, the 4 is probably just fine."
EngagementRings,fg090qp,t1_fg08obj,1580402811.0,"So it was originally a 5 and I sized down to a 4.5. What’s weird about my fingers is that they’re quite small, but my knuckles are wider/larger than my fingers are. So the key for me is sizing the ring so that it can get over the knuckle but not slide off the knuckle too easily. So what ends up happening is, this 4.5 size is still a little roomy on my finger and spins a little if my hands are cold, but it’s not sliding off with no resistance now because my knuckle stops it. But that’s also like the best I can do, haha. I have a size 4 white gold black star sapphire ring with two tiny red rubies on either side of it, which I ADORE because it’s so unique and VERY vintage (it was my great-grandmother’s), but it is REALLY hard to get on my finger because of my knuckle. Like, I have to fight to get it on even when my hands are cold, and if my hands are warm, I have to run my hands under cold water and fight with it for several minutes -- literally minutes, haha -- to get it off. So a size 4, in my opinion, is probably a bit too small for me. I think the 4.5 for my engagement ring is probably the best size for me right now, although maybe if I want it tighter at some point I’ll go down to a 4.25 just to be extra safe. But I’ll wear it a few months first before I do that so that I’m totally sure."

murakami,ffzythu,t3_evw0n3,1580396334.0,I literally wrote notes in a journal about this book -- as if I were in a college literature class -- just to process my thoughts and explore the maze of symbolism and layered meanings that is this book.

EngagementRings,ffzxv3l,t3_ew5utz,1580395674.0,"In case anyone's interested (and also I kinda want to brag a little and this is the place to do it), it's a rose gold ring with blue sapphires (Brilliant Earth's Willow setting) and a 5mm, 0.5 carat diamond. According to the GIA report I got with the ring, the diamond clarity is VVS2, the color grade is D, and the cut grade is ""excellent."" The polish and symmetry are both ""excellent,"" and the fluorescence is a ""strong blue."" So basically, it's an almost totally perfect diamond, which my fiance picked for me without me even asking (I told him, just get me a rose gold ring with moissanite because it's cheaper, don't spend a lot of money on me!). I told him I didn't want a huge center stone because I don't like big, flashy rings, so he got the most perfect diamond he could that wasn't too big, and picked out a unique, nature-like and vintage-esque ring setting that perfectly suits my personality. His thoughtfulness and consideration and care is so touching, I don't have the right words to express how loved he makes me feel. He wanted to get me a perfect ring that perfectly suited me, and he did. What. A. Keeper."
writers,f8slem0,t3_e1o09f,1574783536.0,"My local bookstore is doing so well they can barely keep up. I just took an events & marketing job with them because events are a big driver of revenue. Bookstores are trying to become little community hubs rather than just booksellers. The secret to indie bookstore success, I think, is bookstore-hosted events that foster community and conversation, where you come to hang out and drink coffee or wine and hear a speaker or an author and buying a book becomes an afterthought. The primary ""product"" of the bookstore is no longer just a book, but community, and that's very appealing to people.

Also I think people in general like supporting their community through local buying and like sticking it to big corporations like Amazon, but that might just be me."
exmormon,f8skzqm,t3_e1ttxh,1574783262.0,"This was my favorite part of Frozen 2 as well. I thought it was a really powerful culmination of Elsa's arc, which started with ""Let It Go"" in the first film.

In Frozen, she had to learn to let go of limiting beliefs — specifically, fear of herself and her power — and embrace herself. She'd reached a breaking point of suppressing herself, and she had to break free and ""let it go."" With that came tremendous growth and eventually the opportunity to have a much deeper relationship with her sister.

With ""Into the Unknown,"" Elsa still feels restless. She's embraced herself but she doesn't truly know or understand herself yet, and she wants to delve deeper into self-discovery. Throughout Frozen 2 she's learning about her past while also learning courage and deepening her self-awareness. This then culminates with ""Show Yourself,"" when she realizes that \*she\* is the one she's been waiting to find, not some mysterious person who can explain to her who she is. Only \*she\* can truly know herself and give herself purpose, no one else can do that for her. She finally knows herself, understands herself, and her purpose.

It's so powerful because it strikes down the limiting idea that we need to find ourselves or our worth or our purpose in someone or something else. It forces us to realize that \*we\* are responsible for our growth and our purpose, not anyone else. 

We first need to accept ourselves (""Let It Go""), allow ourselves to be curious about ourselves, listen to ourselves, and seek to understand ourselves better (""Into the Unknown""), and then finally realize truths about ourselves and dive deeper into our purpose (""Show Yourself"").

Gah, I loved it. It resonates so much with me after breaking away from a very conservative religious background."

I don't know if this would help you, but Tears in Heaven by Eric Clapton is a really beautiful song about grief and losing someone so dear to you. I find sad songs like that to be comforting when I've just lost someone, but do what's best for you.

It's so hard to be vulnerable, especially when dealing with depression and all of the horribleness that comes along with it. Maybe you can take that bravery and join some kind of exercise club, like running or boxing? I recently joined a boxing one and it's something I now look forward to every week. The endorphins jolt is such sweet relief from this nasty depression. Or maybe talk to someone about finances (I see a couple comments about that)? I know it's so, so hard.

Maybe that would make a difference. 

Also I’d never really thought about my depression being the problem here, but it seems obvious since you mentioned it. I guess I always thought maybe I just wasn’t a real fiction writer/was never meant to be/it was just a phase. I do see a therapist. We’ve talked about this a little bit, but we could definitely talk more. I’m actively trying to get a different job, fingers crossed! It’s a little frustrating and demoralizing right now tho. Been applying to places for months.

Fantasy,ey5bu2q,t3_cvmat1,1566827658.0,"I loved it, too. Novik is so good at writing on themes of family and friendship, and I love how the romance takes a backseat in Spinning Silver and Uprooted. I'm really tired of romantic storylines being so prominent in most fantasy novels, especially YA ones. Personally, I preferred Uprooted because it felt more streamlined and tugged at my heartstrings more, and I felt like the characters were a little more rounded out. Spinning Silver felt a little busy alternating between three heroines, although I loved each one of them. I almost feel like Spinning Silver could have been expanded into a trilogy, with each book from the POV of one of the three heroines."

At first I thought this was just about a platonic friendship, but after a few listens, now I think it's about falling in love in a really healthy friends-first kind of way, and there's almost a hint at sexual intimacy towards the end. Love it. 10/10"

The first week of doing that was amazing. I hadn't realized how horrible I was feeling all. the. time. Looking at those entries, I also felt pretty strong, too. I hadn't realized how horrible I was feeling because I was making such an effort to be positive and find joy in the little things and I kind of assumed I was doing okay overall even though the day-to-day life was really sucking. I was constantly fighting myself to maintain a positive attitude and it was exhausting. It also helped me make the decision to go on meds, because I saw that I really was making a conscious, cognitive effort to be positive and move past things but I just couldn't.

She also said that one drink might feel more like two when you're on Wellbutrin XL, so there's that to consider as well.
