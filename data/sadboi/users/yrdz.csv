Stay-at-home orders do not violate any part of the Constitution. They pretty clearly fall under emergency powers. 

You're right that these laws still have to be Constitutional (can't discriminate based on race, sex, ability, etc.), but so far I haven't seen any evidence of governors using these laws in a way that violates the Constitution. They definitely could, but the concept of a stay-at-home order is not in and of itself unconstitutional.

Tell me, what clause in the Constitution do you think is violated, and why?

>Not only that, but we're causing far more deaths with the damage to the economy.

Hundreds of thousands of people dying will in fact be worse for the economy in the long term. Plus, if states reopen too early, they will either be forced to re-close or continue to stay open, killing a large swath of their population. Both of these outcomes would absolutely decimate the markets. Bailing out the working class and expanding unemployment benefits is what would actually help the economy right now."

Women are the opposite, they play it safe and take the better average with more benefits (Honestly, women are smarter). This is why early on in careers, women often make more than men--because the sacrifice and risk doesn't pay out until later in careers.
