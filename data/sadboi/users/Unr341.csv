Kerala,fnpe8o4,t3_g2xrai,1587143968.0,The only Good thing that came out of Trance was when the trailer came out and people started predicting what the story was in the comments. Those could be used to make a decent movie. Trance is not even close to being good. Why's it still a relevant topic? Anwar Rasheed has actually good movies in his portfolio. Talk about them instead.

copypasta,f87cq3q,t3_dza2nr,1574326388.0,"I am deeply sad when I'm writing this text post on the r/copypasta subreddit on reddit.com‚Ñ¢. I am very disappointed on how the bots on this subreddit are treated.The main victim is u/cummybot2000. I find phrases like, 'You can put your dong in me cummyüò©üçÜ' or ' Take me to your gulag cummy' to be highly sexual. First of all, reddit ‚Ñ¢ is a platform that has minors, underage kids, and persons below of age 18. I feel like many members of this subreddit are a bad influence on them and I want them to be permabanned (banned permanently) either from this subreddit or from reddit as a whole. I'd like to ask these people, why the f*** are you talking to a bot. It is just computer code. Stop sexualizing it. It doesn't even bother to respond to anyone other than OP. I even sometimes feel sorry for the bot. Okay, let's think from another perspective. Maybe you are talking dirty to the bot because you're afraid to talk dirty to a real person. I'll be personally contacting u/cummybot2000 's lawyers and each and every one on this subreddit that has engaged in one sided sexual conversation with u/cummybot2000 shall be paying a huge sum of money in compensation. I also will ensure the moderators of this subreddit are put in jail for completely ignoring u/cummybot2000's plight. I want the support of everyone else in this subreddit who treat u/cummybot2000 like a gentleman to rise up against this and join me in destroying these people. #SaveCummy #BotLivesBatter"
