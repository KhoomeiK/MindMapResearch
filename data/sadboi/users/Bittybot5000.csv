mentalhealth,fmmqjs1,t3_fvu1z8,1586210174.0,"Hey there! Not a professional, but I thought I‚Äôd share something helpful for me. 

After a past suicide attempt, I had a terribly  traumatic stay in a psych ward. So after my next attempt in order to keep me out of the hospital, my friends came up with a system for me. I reached out to a lot of people and found one person for each day of the week. That‚Äôs my go-to person for the day if I need to talk about ANYTHING. They‚Äôre kinda my on-call crisis companions. It helped when I was doing really badly, but it also helps me stay positive for longer when I have people to chat to everyday. 

Just something that might help others. 
Please keep reaching out when you need the help. There are plenty of people here for you!"

Psychosis,fml4shr,t3_fv617g,1586178598.0,"Hey hun, 
I want to share a story with you. I suffer from a multitude of mental illness, and psychosis is one. I was once sent to a mental hospital where they took me off my meds to adjust them. It was a really scary time for me because ALL my psychosis came back without any meds. But the one thing that really helped was seeing my friends and family. It helped keep me grounded, even when I was waaaaay out of it. 
I‚Äôm telling you all this because I‚Äôm sure your boyfriend appreciates your visits, even when he‚Äôs out of it. 

When I was in the hospital it was really hard on my mom. I‚Äôm sure she would relate to your situation. I hope I can ease your troubles by letting you know, from someone who‚Äôs been on the inside, they‚Äôre doing their best to take care of him. They‚Äôre probably going to find better meds for him. They‚Äôre watching him around the clock so he‚Äôs safe even if he‚Äôs off his meds. Your boyfriend will get through this, no matter how hard it is, because he‚Äôs in good hands. 

So how can we help you? I‚Äôm sorry this is affecting you like it did my mom. I‚Äôm here to chat if you ever need someone to listen. 

Sending you all my thoughts and love!"
KindVoice,fmiq8lp,t1_fmipgji,1586114704.0,"Hey!
Yeah, the offer still stands! Though I'll be honest I'll probably check the chat more often that my messages. But I'll do my best to check here!

What's going on? How can I best support you? Do you want a distraction? To talk about you troubles? Some advice? Just someone to listen?"
