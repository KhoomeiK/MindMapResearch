So it's not even the possession itself that rubbed me the wrong way, but that in this case this was being used as a way to shame a little girl and then convert her. It was a harmful thing.

Kinda meant to just acknowledge cultural differences because witch beliefs aren't just a thing this missionary came up with there, like it's not just the missionary. There are beliefs about witches prevalent there in a broader sense outside of the missionary's influence.

I had read in a marriage book how women always have excuses, like being sleepy, having a headache, etc. There was a great sense of satisfaction when I was so completely able to change her mind; it wasn’t that difficult. She is wired right. It made me sleepy so I dozed off again. I was just dropping off when I heard the crash. It came from the bathroom. She looked dead l\ying there all twisted up in a weird position half in half out of the shower. The curtain and the rod lay flung out on the floor around her and water was spraying everywhere. It was one scary moment – my new bride dead on our honeymoon. I quickly turned off the water and bent to cradle her in my arms. I gently shook her while examining her injured forehead, which was quickly swelling and turning blue, “What’s wrong honey? Are you sick?”
> After she opened her eyes it took her a minute to focus and then her expression changed. It was a mixture of pity and anger, although her voice was like a deep sigh as she whispered, “You really don’t know do you?” Man, it sounded like she was accusing me or something! Since she was hurt I let her have her say and boy, she laid it on.
She sat up, pulling herself away from me, turning where she could look me square in the face. The gist of what she said was something along these lines: “In the last 48 hours I haven’t slept more than two hours undisturbed. My feet have 20 or more tiny holes in them because you wouldn’t let me take an extra five minutes to unpack my tennis shoes. My shoulder is sore from trying to carry thirty pounds of crabs for hours (they didn’t weight that much.) My hand is burned from trying to stuff a fighting crab into a kettle of boiling water, which seems very much like torturing the poor thing, AND, all the while you lay in a state of repose. Due to lack of sleep and sun, my eyes feel like they are full of sand. I have had little to eat. I am female, for crying out loud. I just want to sleep without you pawing on me. Besides, I have body parts I didn’t even know existed until now and they are killing me….so what is wrong with me??? I’m the weaker vessel, remember? It’s in the Bible, chapter one, verse one….or somewhere.”

We were playing this game where you held a phone over your head and it displayed a word and the person holding it over their head couldn't see it and they had to guess the word.

Makes it worse that the person who was guessing is like a 7 year old girl.

Anyway the category was professions. The word to guess was ""doctor.""

Aunt: it's who you see when you get sick

Girl: nurse?

Aunt and mom simultaneously: no, the man

Everyone else immediately reacted woooooow"
LifeProTips,fnh1y3h,t1_fncx636,1586952638.0,"Rubber gloves you throw away aren't effective protection? In combination with n95 masks?

I mean sure soap will protect you just as much as long as you don't touch your face, but I do gloves, discard, then soap and that's less contamination on my skin.

Masks and gloves of any type help remind you to not touch your face for sure."

Signed, Bernie supporter (sad) that makes more than you apparently but still wants to pay more in taxes (and yes I donate regularly and have reached out to places to donate directly even when they don't have an obvious venue to do so)

Edit: And also, fuck Trump"
LifeProTips,fnbtaym,t1_fnaayid,1586821902.0,"Yeah when I go to the grocery store, I wear a mask and gloves. Our grocery store has hand wipes for when you enter and leave and I still use them even with gloves on because my gloves have touched things and while it protects me, I want to make sure whatever my gloves touch that they've been sanitized as much as possible still for others that come after me.

But I've seen people with gloves not bother."

I went to the same church as the Jonas Brothers lol

We didn't hate Jews... But also yeah some weird appropriation going on there."
Coronavirus,fn3697y,t1_fn3351v,1586613879.0,"Also I've come across quite a few violent homeless people here. And I'm a small woman. People screaming and throwing things and attacking people. I've seen it. And see a lot reported on the Citizen app.

I don't hate the homeless. I've befriended some over shared cigarettes, texted some even and financially helped out here and there for one I got to know really well.

But living here, there's too many. You can't help 20+ people you see every day. And not everyone just wants water.

So good for you for helping someone. But it also sounds like you just want a pat on the back and have a superiority complex about it, being excited about the city potentially having the same outbreak problems NYC is having because not everyone is such an angel like you. Yup, hoping SF will have bodies piling up is very virtuous of you."

But, non quarantine time, during my work commute (an hour walk each way because I like to walk), am I supposed to carry 20+ water bottles each day for every homeless person I see and confront all of them as a small woman in some secluded areas?

I love VanderMeer. When I first saw the movie I was disappointed. But I rewatched and separated it from the books and enjoyed it.

Point being. Read the books."
Lovecraft,fn1shbt,t1_fl9troi,1586569060.0,Have you read the book for Annihilation? The movie was made before the second and third book so they go off in different directions. And I love VanderMeer. Highly recommend.
