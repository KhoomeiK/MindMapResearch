depression,f6obeoa,t1_f6oat0x,1573012529.0,"For years, I’ve held onto that hope that if other people have survived worse and gotten better, then I could, too. When I showed no signs of improvement with medical intervention, I found it harder and harder to keep hoping that I will become a success story.

Currently, I look at my downward spiral and think, “it can get better, it can get worse, who knows?” For what it’s worth, I’m still trying to live with myself. I’m still struggling, and I don’t know if I’ll ever stop struggling.

And that’s okay."

depression,f6o93e4,t1_f6ny3mr,1573010761.0,"I feel you. I dislike it when someone says “you have to WANT to be better,” because the vast majority of us do desperately want to improve.

I also believe it’s unhelpful to push both the narrative of “it will get better” and the narrative of “it never gets better.” No one can say which way our lives will turn, but dwelling in uncertainty is scary, so most opt for “there is hope, it will get better.” However, when my depression has become more severe despite my best efforts, hearing that is demoralizing. It pins the blame squarely on me.

My brain may keep torturing me as it has for the past few years, and I won’t hold onto unrealistic hopes that it will stop. I can’t say that my depression will get better when it has given me no signs of improvement. I live on because it’s better than the alternative. For now, I’ll keep trying to live with myself."

depression,f6o5vh1,t1_f6o28nj,1573008463.0,"Even with those who did take their lives, the media assumes that had they kept living and gotten more help, they would’ve gotten better. It’s assumed that their deaths are the result of not enough intervention/support, or worse, not being “strong enough” to improve."
depression,f6o596s,t1_f6o2ef1,1573008032.0,"The thing is, I was trying all the options I could. I hoped that the coping mechanisms my therapist shared would work, but they didn’t. I hoped that the antidepressants my psychiatrist prescribed, one after another, would work, but they didn’t (and even gave me more suicidal thoughts and headaches). Heck, I even hoped that just working harder at my career would distract my brain enough, but it didn’t.

Hope is the fuel I ran on. I wanted so badly to end up as a success story so I can inspire others, but that didn’t happen. 

Today, I keep trying because it’s better than the alternative. Things could get better, things could get worse, I can’t say. For now, I’ll keep trying to live with myself."

depression,f6mziua,t1_f6mxu3j,1572982049.0,"I agree, both outcomes need to be acknowledged. However, I believe there’s too much focus on “it will get better,” which is demoralizing for those who have struggled for years and have seen no signs of improvement.

When I talk about the struggles I continue to go through, I’m often bombarded with sympathetic stories of success. I appreciate their efforts, but I think it’d be more helpful if people simply *listened*. I don’t expect them to fix me, when meds and therapy have not done so. I want to talk about my experience honestly, without the caveat of adding a positive twist at the end."
