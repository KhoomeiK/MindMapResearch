BPD,fqli9zi,t3_gjfzwi,1589458826.0,"The thing about BPD is that it makes you question and second guess yourself at every corner. When youâ€™ve been thinking or behaving a certain way for most of your life it makes you unable to trust your own thoughts and feelings. Therefore you wonder whether your thoughts and feelings are coming from you and are valid or if itâ€™s the BPD part. Thatâ€™s what makes our identity so unstable because you canâ€™t separate your true self from the disordered part. Therapy definitely helps with this but for me I find comfort and relief in hearing other people explain their experiences because it helps me to organise which parts of my actions, behaviours and thoughts are experienced by others and therefore I can say â€˜okay, so thatâ€™s likely due to BPD and not my actual personality.â€™ 
I donâ€™t agree that you can necessarily take every symptom and behaviour and understand why you do it. If we could do this then we wouldnâ€™t have disordered thinking because this is something most people without BPD can do naturally."
BPD,fqipy7e,t3_gj1nob,1589399298.0,Iâ€™ve been doing this since I was a child and never understood why. Iâ€™ve even said it to my parents at home and they couldnâ€™t understand what I was talking about because we were already at home. Iâ€™m so glad you mentioned this because Iâ€™ve always thought it was some sort of tick that I couldnâ€™t control. Sometimes it just comes out.

BPD,fledaai,t3_fob7an,1585082171.0,I both love and hate myself at the same time. I think Iâ€™m better than everyone else but I also believe everyone else is superior. Itâ€™s confusing to understand how that could be.
BPD,firgf9m,t3_f9f573,1582663906.0,"Firstly, let me politely request that you donâ€™t refer to a group of mentally ill people as â€˜bordiesâ€™.   Itâ€™s not cute and Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not the only one here who would take offence. Do you also have nickname for people diagnosed with cancer? 

You start by saying that you are here to tell your story and get some insight. I should probably explain to you that this is a supportive group for sufferers of BPD where we can relate, vent and just help each other find a way through the dark. 
This is not a place for anyone to shame or accuse. Your tone throughout suggests that you are seeking some sort of validation/attention for your own mistakes/actions and are not looking for help for your girlfriend. 

Letâ€™s address what you referred to as â€˜shortfallsâ€™ your behaviour. You say that you are guilty of using Instagram to flirt with other people whilst you are in a relationship. This may appear as a minor misdemeanour to you however to someone who suffers with BPD this is absolutely a betrayal. This can trigger trauma/fears from the sufferers past involving friends/family/partners. 
Have you thought about why it is you feel the need to flirt with other people whilst in a relationship? Just something to think about. 

So this new girl youâ€™ve been with, you say it was casual but she started treating you well and caring for you. This is something I find interesting that youâ€™ve bought up. 
BPD sufferers are often loving and attentive towards partners. However we need to receive the same support and care in order to feel safe and secure. Her emotional outbursts are understandable when you consider your cheating, flirting and the fact that she is under stress/pressure due to exams. 
This does not mean that her actions during these outbursts are acceptable. Nobody should be physically/emotionally abusing anyone and a mental illness does not defend the fact that she acted in such a way. 
Having said that if she is struggling and is not receiving the support and therapy she may need then this is what happens. 

Iâ€™m not even going to talk about the fact that you referred to her as an â€˜angry demonessâ€™ which shoes a lack of empathy, understanding and respect for your â€˜girlfriendâ€™. 
So she took an online test to self diagnose and found she identified with some of the symptoms, this does not necessarily mean she had BPD but it definitely sounds like she Is battling with something. 
Perhaps you should have reassured her at this point and advised her to reach out to a team of people who can actually assess and help her. 
The fact that she has had a good upbringing does not mean that she isnâ€™t suffering. Not every person diagnosed with BPD has faced some huge trauma in their childhood. Also donâ€™t assume that you know everything that she has been through. 

Do you have Narcissistic disorder? 
That is a questions which can only be answered by a qualified professional however from what you have told us I would advise you keep an open mind. 
I canâ€™t say why you seem to be attracted to BPD sufferers but it sounds like you are not capable of meeting their needs in a relationship. 
Iâ€™m not trying to say that you should break up with your girlfriend but it doesnâ€™t sound like a healthy relationship. You both need to discuss the issues youâ€™re having and figure it out from there. 
I advise you not to just dump her out of nowhere without an explanation or without talking to her about these problems youâ€™re having because that could trigger abandonment issues. 

Finally itâ€™s quite common for it to take time to recover from a break up and move on. The amount of time it takes is dependant on the person and the situation. An â€˜easy exitâ€™ is never an option if you love the person. If you love someone you wouldnâ€™t be able to just walk away without someone getting hurt. 

In conclusion, we are a group who respect and support each other and it sounds like your girlfriend could use a place like this."

BPD,fi7zbnu,t3_f6xzay,1582230638.0,"I can kind of relate to this. I have always done something similar to gain attention from friends, family, boyfriends, work colleagues and therapists. 
Iâ€™ve never come up with a complete lie but I do embellish things a lot which consists of small lies related to something that happened. 
Iâ€™ve never told my psychiatrist about this behaviour because itâ€™s embarrassing. The worse part is that I donâ€™t feel guilty when people give me attention, i feel like I deserve and earned it."
BPD,fi71yd7,t3_f6s99n,1582212578.0,Most of the time I canâ€™t start conversations so people think Iâ€™m shy. However if people start talking me then I can talk quite confidently but not for long. I have a tendency to just end the conversation somehow and run away. I think itâ€™s because I donâ€™t know how to carry on the conversation or Iâ€™m aware that theyâ€™re starting to  think Iâ€™m weird. Itâ€™s like I get self conscious because Iâ€™m hyper aware of others reactions and feelings towards me.
CozyPlaces,fhter4v,t3_f4q2t4,1581873759.0,I used to live 10 minutes away from there. I once completed a 12 mile charity bike ride and in order to get to the finish line I had to cycle up that hill.
BPD,fh40jch,t3_f1ckrr,1581274126.0,"The feeling you might be experiencing could be adrenaline and it could be related to the impulsiveness that often comes with having BPD. When I contemplate suicide I start to feel dizzy and lightheaded but only when Iâ€™m on a high. When Iâ€™m feeling extremely low itâ€™s completely different. It makes me feel angry because the rational part of my brain says I shouldnâ€™t have to feel this way but then the BPD takes over and thatâ€™s when I feel euphoric. 
BPD makes you do certain things in order to feel like you are in control. Self harming can make you feel like you are in control of your emotions because it gives you the ability to replace emotional pain with physical pain. 
It sounds like planning and fantasising about suicide is giving you a similar kind of relief. 
Please seek help from someone you can trust. If you are in therapy then this is something you should discuss as they will be able to help you to understand these feelings."
BPD,ffptywb,t1_ffpeojh,1580105619.0,"I have family who Iâ€™ve had to rely on for financial support in the past but I hate to do it because itâ€™s not fair on them. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to be possible to work through this situation so Iâ€™ll have no choice but leave. Unfortunately due to my poor work history (I barely last a year in any job), my CV reflects badly on me and it is a struggle to even get an interview for a job now. Iâ€™d love to know how people with this BPD function normally because for me work and life in general are just beyond my capabilities."
BPD,ff0i0mo,t3_er16ez,1579469065.0,"Itâ€™s just that I feel like I no longer have an identity. Iâ€™m always empty and emotionless except when Iâ€™m angry but I try so hard to hide this that Iâ€™ve become a bit robotic and fake. People assume Iâ€™m stuck up or weird because of the way I interact with them. The truth is that I just donâ€™t know how to be what they would consider â€˜normalâ€™. 
Iâ€™ve been in and out of therapy since I was first diagnosed but it cost a lot of money and I wasnâ€™t gaining much from it. 
Iâ€™m working full time and completing a 2 year graduate course so there isnâ€™t much time to fit in therapy sessions."
BPD,fekuegg,t3_epgpio,1579207806.0,When I was 16 I locked myself in my bathroom at 2am and pierced my nose with a sewing needle. My mum was horrified when she saw it the next day. When she asked why I did it I couldnâ€™t exactly give a reason. I didnâ€™t particularly want a nose piercing that much. Maybe I was bored of feeling numb.
