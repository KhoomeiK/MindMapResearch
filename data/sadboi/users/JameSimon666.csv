Properties do have a risk, as any investment. They are still very low risk long term.

As for stocks, you foot the bill on buying them. On housing, you need to buy in. Once you have tenants, they foot the investment, not you. In the end, if you can do simple maths, you will be having a very small buy in for a very large profit over time."

Also, funny that house costs are lower but rents are higher.

VALORANT,fppp4o3,t1_fppohjd,1588806446.0,"Wrong. An anti-cheat should a) prevent cheats from running or b) prevent your system from running said cheats.

Without the EULA, it's effectively a computer virus that has an infect phase (user installs the game) and attack phase (user uses the computer).

While I'm not clear if the intent for the app to do whatever it is it does is malicious in nature, the app behavior is clearly and willingly malicious to your operating system.

It wouldn't be too difficult to a) run only when the game runs and b) prevent the user from running the game unless apps / drivers / services X Y or Z are not running.

Nos let's compare to vanguard

- computer has wanted apps
- user installs anti-cheat software (not anti-virus, please mind that)
- anti-cheat software disables user's apps because it thinks they are harmful.
