So there is this kid on my street, I’ll call him EK and he’s a brat. Some things that have happened in the past are things like: he destroys my property and tries to hurt other kids. Yesterday I was outside and I went outside to see some of the nice girls that lived next door, hoping we could talk, dance or something like that. Sadly EK was out there too. He usually isn’t allowed in my tree house because of the past happenings, but sometimes I make exceptions if he’s being okay. So while me and the girls were sitting in my tree house and drawing, he decided it would be a good idea to barge in and run in and out of it over and over trying to chase a kid. I tried to tell him that we were just trying to relax, and that if he wanted to chase that kid, he can’t run in and out of my tree house. But of course he didn’t listen. And while we were TRYING to talk, the “game” escalated. He started to try to ATTACK this 6 year old kid he was chasing. The little kid’s brother (around the age of 8) tried to help him by getting him in my tree house for a few minutes. But, EK decided to start KICKING DOWN the door. We let the little kid out so EK would stop kicking the door. We thought EK would have calmed down by now. But no, he started trying to CHOKE this little kid. The little kids brother stepped in again and tried get EK out of the way by pushing him aside. We went into the nice girl’s backyard without EK so we could calm down a little bit. So when we went out of the backyard a few minutes later, we saw EK TAKING THE AIR OUT OF A CAR TIRE. None of us knew the owner of the car, so we couldn’t tell them. We took EK to his parents while his little sister told his parents. We tried to explain to him that he couldn’t commit a crime because he was “upset” he claimed that he “didn’t know what he was doing.” We told him that was no excuse, and he should know better. Then he said that I was a “bully” because I “always bossed him around.” I told him I was not a bully, I just sometimes need to tell him that what he is doing is wrong. He said I was an idiot and a brat. First of all, I am the opposite of a brat, he’s the one that gets away with all this stuff, And how am I an idiot if he’s the one doing the idiotic stuff?!? His parents came out and made him go inside. Serves him right. We were all peaceful until he came out again an hour later. Ugh, here we go again. I had my radio outside and me and the nice kids outside were listening to it without a problem. He started unplugging and plugging in my radio. There are 3 movable cords on my radio so people had to protect them so we weren’t annoyed to death. I was so tired by the time he went inside smh. I don’t want to deal with him again today

Second time was a different sub. We were about 5th grade walking in line downstairs for something. The kid in front of me was chatting and the sub got mad and took him by, (I can’t remember if it was by his hair or his ear) and dragged to the front of the line where she could keep and eye on him."
