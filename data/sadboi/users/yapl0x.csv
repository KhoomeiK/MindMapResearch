Advice,fnzkvy3,t3_g4ro5z,1587396021.0,"I had a teacher in 5th grade too, actually, that was really similar to what you're describing but she would often call me out during class for not paying attention, told my parents to get my diagnosed with ADHD, etc. She kept telling school professionals and my parents that I had emotional problems (I don't) and other psychological disorders. 

Her husband and daughter were killed by a drunk driver a couple years before and she was a mess because of it. She made me her mission that year because in her own sick way, it made her feel better. It doesn't excuse her actions or your teacher's actions either but sometimes, even our own teachers, have their own shit and are just coping in the wrong ways. 

I also had a teacher do this to me in high school. Not only did she hate my older sibling and held a grudge but had to go on personal leave that year because her husband was very sick. 

Sometimes people need a therapist and unfortunately, they don't know how to act. 

I know this isn't advice..I don't know what I'd do in your shoes. Best of luck to you."
