So this wouldn't faze me."
Gamingcirclejerk,f2mqj3u,t3_ddo0bs,1570307815.0,"That was a terrible analogy. What is up with miserable people always making terrible analogies?

The difference between a game and a decapitated body is that you can't put arms, legs, and a head back on a decapitated body but if the game was a decapitated body it can. This is why that analogy just sucks he is acting as if all they did was put a band aid on it even though they reworked the system in place and added more stuff to the game."
Gamingcirclejerk,f2mngnl,t3_ddsdkb,1570306989.0,/uj I just find it funny that people complain about EA's game being trash then buy their next game that they think it is trash. Some of them go and pirate their games even though they think it is trash.
Gamingcirclejerk,f2mli8m,t1_f2j6dot,1570306490.0,"Isn't the game at a basic level, just looting and stealing from other pirates? What really is not to get?

How much content does the game need to make it great? Does it need to be on borderlands level where you get bazillion guns where it has the same base weapon with the same base stats but with different multipliers so it make it ""different""?

It is the same when it comes to Destiny. I don't understand the whole, ""It doesn't have enough content!"" because when compared to their former game, Halo, Destiny has more content.

What does the game have to do to have just enough content for these people?"
