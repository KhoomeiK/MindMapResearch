SaimanSays,fqs4axh,t1_fqpmki2,1589598203.0,"Because they're teenagers. They like to repeat dumb shit their friends start to make them look cool and in sync with internet culture. Ex: The recent floor gang thing. It is one of the most immature, dumbest joke I've ever seen from PewDiePie's channel. But go browse through his subreddit now and you'll find tons of posts referencing this. 
Now, I don't want to defend his fanbase because some of them truly were hiding under the faÃ§ade of ""ironical jokes"" to actually be racist towards Indians and get away with it, which they got away with. But I still refuse to believe majority of his fanbase wanted to be blatantly racist and homophobic towards a company. 
And as for Saiman's explanation, i still find it shaky at best. The ""context matters"" thing is applicable to him as well as Carryminati too. I used to watch Carry's videos back in 2016 and if I remember correctly, he used to say ""beti"" back in the day too. It is just one of his ""funnies"", if you know what i mean. And as for the transphobia, I personally wasn't able to pinpoint what part of the video was coming out as transphobic. But that doesn't invalidate the problems Saiman raised in this video. If he truly wanted to bring this problem to light, call out all the YouTubers that do it. (I also read somewhere in these comments that Carry acknowledged his ""beti"" gimmick on Instagram, and said that in the future, he would avoid saying that)."

SaimanSays,fqm0cci,t1_fqly1j8,1589469300.0,"Yeah that was what I was thinking yesterday after watching the roast video. Both environments were pretty toxic and even though they were meant as jokes, both PewDiePie's fanbase and Carry's fanbase at one point start believing it unironically. I experienced the racism first hand and I started to distance myself from PewDiePie's fanbase and now I don't find him or his fanbase appealing at all. People were right to call out Saiman regarding this issue because Jesus Christ, the pdp sub is toxic af against indians. It is good to laugh at ourselves but they were blurring the line between casual jokes and racism covered in layer of irony. Believe me, I don't consider Felix to be a bad person per se but his fanbase is whole another issue. Same with Carry's fanbase. Saiman was right to call out his brand of humor which promoted homophobia and sexism (and not just him but a lot of YouTubers have this brand of humour) but I think he should explain/correct/re evaluate his stance on the pdp issue."
