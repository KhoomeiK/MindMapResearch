bipolar2,footifl,t1_foot1x1,1587946136.0,Did you find that SSRI's and SNRI's made your mood less stable?
bipolar2,footd36,t3_g8bvxu,1587946046.0,"I'd strongly suggest that you see a psychiatrist and tell her exactly what you've told us here. And see this excellent website, by a psychiatrist who has published two books (one for the public, one for primary care docs) about the spectrum of mood disorders.

bipolar2,foor8j0,t1_foopy7q,1587944757.0,Thank you! Are you on high or low dose lithium? Does Abilify put your appetite in overdrive like Olanzapine?
BipolarReddit,foktlx2,t3_g5jr0y,1587848707.0,"That's one of the reasons I like the NP that I see for psych issues so much -- both she and the doctor who supervises her work take what I say seriously and understand that I'm an informed patient. I feel sometimes that she's too credulous about what the drug reps tell her about new drugs, but I can always just say ""no"" to a suggestion. It shouldn't be something special to be treated as an adult, but reading about other people's experience indicates that this kind of respect can be hard to find among psychiatrists."
BipolarReddit,fod8cbu,t1_fne4974,1587681546.0,"I identify. This whole thing has helped me realize  how really reclusive I'm becoming.

I've been working from home for 3 weeks, and I live alone. Most people in this situation would feel like they were in Hell, but I'm fine with it. I haven't even been phoning people. When I began taking antidepressants years ago, I began to have less desire to be around other people. But I never thought I'd become this solitary."
