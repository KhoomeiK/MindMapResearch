Pixel Worlds. (similar to growtopia) I don't really have much to say about this because I still found Growtopia better."
EDAnonymous,fqtbilq,t1_fqsx3eg,1589635368.0,"I'm so sorry that happened. Something similar also happened to me, but my dad was the one who did it. He said my trousers looked tighter cause I was visibly gaining weight. Now whenever I buy pants, I can't help but think of that specific moment. I'm sure I'll forget about that instance, but I know I'll never forget the feeling of humiliation."

EDAnonymous,fpfzasr,t3_gd5s9p,1588589096.0,"I was always seen as skinny, but I never saw what others meant by that. I just considered myself to be normal. I did want to be lean before (I was a tennis player), but I just accepted that I couldn’t be like that cause I was 15 and I had different priorities. I’d still constantly compare my size to others, but I didn’t think much of it.

One day, I decided to wear pants that my dad bought me. He bought it a year before I had started wearing it, but one night he said that the pants looked tighter on me already. I know he didn’t mean anything negative, but that one statement became the last piece of encouragement for my ED to start.

Oh and those Onision “rates girl’s bodies” videos. It triggered the fuck out of me."

My god. Sometimes I don’t even wonder why it’s hard for a lot of people to seek help when there’s others like this."
eating_disorders,fo72kpf,t3_g60to0,1587571128.0,"Hey. I’m sorry that you’re going through this, but being 5’3 and 87lbs is underweight. I don’t really know what advice to give you because I’m going through similar, but know that I’m rooting for you <3"
EDAnonymous,fny9uv3,t3_g4d4d7,1587357056.0,"I technically do have one person I can talk to this about. She just developed an ED last year and I’m worried that if I open up to her, she’ll just find more ways to encourage her ED. Or I’m probably just scared she’ll be thinner than I am cAuSe My ED iS My ED!!!1! And everything is a competition to me— eye—"

EDAnonymous,fn9e15j,t1_fn9bblj,1586769328.0,"It’s different for everyone. When I was in my lowest point of my ED, hearing that I needed to eat just made me angry and self-destructive because I never saw how thin I was. Until this day, I still don’t see it.

What I’m saying as that these “you should do x” can be harmful depending on who it’s being said to."

But when you mentioned that it was a terrible way of trying to just get through the day, it made me realize that this isn’t normal for most people. :("

AskWomen,f1q2km0,t3_da9r7w,1569692376.0,I was young and still wasn’t that good in putting on makeup. So I tried putting on eyeliner thirty minutes before a performance. It looked really bad and I had to redo it a couple of times. I then started sobbing and eventually just gave up. Meh.
