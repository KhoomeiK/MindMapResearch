It is almost as if doctors don't view alcohol as a drug, because they categorize alcohol separately from drugs. And you were the one that brought up the classification of Cannabis, I never said it wasn't a drug. It is very much a drug, and a drug where even small amounts create a visible change in perception."

You kind of contradicted yourself a little bit there, but I think it was just a typo.

unpopularopinion,f88cpti,t1_f87qcl6,1574352467.0,"Doctors on health checkups literally ask if you consume caffeine, drink alcohol, or take any drugs. They are seen as separate categories.

Alcohol, in my opinion, isn't a hard drug, only because you can be a semi-occasional drinker and only have a few a week. The same can't be said about meth or fentanyl. ""Oh I'm just a casual fentanyl user"" doesn't sound healthy, much different from ""oh I just have a couple of drinks a week.""

I agree that alcohol is overrated, but every psychoactive drug becomes a hard drug when taken outside of the realm of moderation. It's just that some are unhealthy with or without moderation brought into context."
