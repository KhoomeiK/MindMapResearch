AskReddit,f8tpsf9,t1_f8tp9ci,1574808665.0,I feel like I could have written this myself. I will say it is reassuring but also sad to know that I’m not the only one experiencing these exact feelings..
StupidFood,ezwo4hg,t1_ezwmblw,1568221140.0,Yeah nah. That fish is definitely NOT supposed to be that color take it from a chef... me..

depression,eohg242,t3_brsy1y,1558580627.0,"Literally just went through this last week.. sending you good vibes. But like I always say. (Warning, this is super corny but it helps me) we’re all like rubber balls. Sometimes we hit the bottom really really hard. But that’s just so we can bounce back up higher and higher than before. You got throw that bouncy ball at the ground to get it to bounce as high as it can. You just gotta keep pushing and bouncing!!"
