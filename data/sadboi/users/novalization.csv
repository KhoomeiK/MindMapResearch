depressed,exrqx13,t3_ctur9z,1566521869.0,"My dude you are not alone at all , im in a very similar situation except that im the one who pushes my friends and family away , theyre still here but i pretty much isolated myslef and ive never felt more terrible.
The only difference is that im afraid to vent or open up to people because all that shot started when the person i cared about the most decided that she doesnt wanna be my friend anymore and i just cant lose more people.
I did feel like i had it all at some point too.
I guess a good advice is focusing on skills that might bring money in the future like someone in the comments said.
Just know that youre not alone."
