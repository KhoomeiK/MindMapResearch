Daylio,f2iyoxv,t3_ddk5x8,1570264660.0,I absolutely second this request!! I have thought the same thing every day. The daily average isn’t an accurate representation of my mood because of the extremes. And that would be important to track
BPD,f2dxkh9,t3_dcxfal,1570169344.0,"This is so beautiful! I remember reading it earlier when you shared it in the chat :) You’re very talented, and I hope you continue writing AND sharing. It takes a lot of courage but the world deserves to hear your thoughtful and powerful voice as much as you are able to share it! 💗"
BPD,f2bc734,t3_dcu9f4,1570124531.0,"I do this too. It may help to come in with a set of bullet points you want to discuss with your therapist. Not just in your head but written out the night before or that morning. You can prioritize what’s most important for you to work on when you’re more clear headed and not in the (sometimes) overwhelming environment of a therapist’s office. Hope this helps. If not, maybe you’re struggling to connect with your therapist. There are different approaches. I found that a quiet therapist who just allowed me to ramble on and on wasn’t helpful. I finally switched and found someone who was more directive. He asked questions and I felt like it was more of a conversation than a monologue. It was so much better."
BorderlinePDisorder,f2984ks,t1_f291pe6,1570084992.0,"I’m curious about this too! Have you read about the different types of borderline? To my understanding they aren’t used very much anymore since treatment is a lot more individualized so we’re all kinda grouped in as BPD. And while there are so many characteristics we all share, there are 4 (maybe 5?) sub-types of the diagnosis, at least according to one researched who identified them. If you haven’t heard about those I can try to look up where I was reading this and send you the link tomorrow morning. Reading about it helped me come to terms that we are all part of this community because of our disorder but we can experience it in really different ways, and that’s not a bad thing"
BPD,f297whr,t1_f297514,1570084684.0,"Absolutely. It feels like you’re frozen and you have to relive it, I think mostly because it happens so suddenly. They aren’t the typical memories I’ve held onto. It feels like they’ve been long suppressed, even if they’re not particularly traumatic. I think I just freeze because I become shocked, in a way. Like WOW I can’t believe the level of detail I am recalling this moment which has been so distant from me for so many years, and yet the details are so vivid. It’s like flashbacks but not even necessarily what I’d consider significant moments. Like my first crushes. Or basketball practice as a kid. Or the sound of bells ringing. But so vivid."
BorderlinePDisorder,f291jci,t3_dclx6l,1570077167.0,"ISFJ...total opposites! Lol that’s really funny. I wonder what it would look like with a large sample though. There are so many different experiences of BPD though - some of us express our rage outwards and others inwards, just to take one example."
BPD,f28zqxy,t1_f280i2g,1570075415.0,"I also think this may be a PTSD thing. I recently had a very traumatic event in my life and these last few months, I have been getting extremely intense intrusive memories - both about the event and also about things completely unrelated. Memories from years ago, even childhood, that I haven’t thought about for YEARS. They seem really random. But it’s new for me since the most recent trauma."
BPD,f28za1p,t3_dcllzn,1570074975.0,Can I wait here with you for answers? Lol. I wish I could help. I’m struggling with the same question and it’s beyond painful. You’re not alone. 💕
BPD,f1yks8l,t1_f1w6ny9,1569818315.0,Why does your name say “Border Patrol” next to it?
Daylio,f1yhx40,t3_cuoul5,1569816636.0,Do you know how to get this chart in iOS?? Can’t find it but would love this level of detail
BPD,f1ste4u,t3_daqmbv,1569733804.0,"Definitely sending you strength! You can absolutely do this. You will make it through and will come out even happier on the other side of this situation. Keep up this great attitude you have in this post! I know it’s easier said than done but you seem to be on the right track :) What are some ways you are coping? How do you remind yourself that it’ll be okay? It’ll be good to think of specifics to remember and return to in case you forget, or start feeling low. And I’m sure the rest of us would love your insight!"
BPD,f1l84uu,t3_d9s8nw,1569547970.0,"I’ve been there and it is SO hard. I’m sorry for the pain you must be experiencing. I know it can feel almost unbearable. The only suggestion I have is to try as hard as you possibly can to give her space. Work on your mental health and distract yourself with tv shows, new friends, work, studies, podcasts, games, exercise - anything you can think of that isn’t self destructive. Give it some time without contact and when you are feeling better, try to reach out with a very heartfelt apology and explanation of what you’ve been going through. Don’t make excuses or set expectations of them. But just making amends - over time and NOT right now - can really help you heal. Until that time comes, just focus on yourself and if you’re lucky enough to have other friends and family, try to spend time with them. Of course those relationships won’t feel nearly as close as the one you had with your FP. But it can still help. There’s hope that you may someday reconcile, but if you try to hard now it’ll only ruin your chances (coming from horribly painful experience). Wishing you strength and peace 💗"
BPD,f1l1ddm,t1_f1ktrvj,1569544298.0,"If you don’t mind my asking, was this in the US? I feel a huge stigma here. What was the appropriate time for you to bring this up to your manager? And what kind of documentation was needed? Hopefully not prying into something so personal, but any advice on this is needed because I’m currently taking time off and would love to get a job but I don’t even know what accommodations would be appropriate to ask for and more importantly when to ask for them. And whether I should tell them health reasons are the reason for a big blank space on my resume lately."
mentalhealth,f1l01n2,t3_d9p25z,1569543577.0,"YES and it was after trying SO many medications with horrendous side effects. I wish I would’ve had access to it MUCH sooner. If you can afford it, absolutely absolutely please do it. It’s not magic but it will tell you which medications are a higher risk for adverse reactions and negative side effects based on your own metabolism, and which are safe to try. If you have more questions PM me. It’s not a cure-all but it’s soooo worth it. I could’ve saved myself so much pain with something so simple."
selfharm,f1kfaxy,t3_d9mneo,1569535008.0,Beautiful quote! The rest of the article is absolute shit though. So aggravating to read about the wealthy staying in “beachfront villas” during their crises while the rest of us are treated like scum 👍
selfharm,f1kd0od,t3_d9fbla,1569534346.0,"Love this. I wish I could have that confidence and I honestly was almost there when they were just scars. Now I’ve “relapsed” and they’re clearly pretty new again, too ashamed and worried that people will confront me or judge me because it’s my present and not my past. Thanks for sharing this though."
BPD,f1kbxfc,t1_f1jonzy,1569534040.0,"Sorry to jump in but could you DM it to me too, please? I don’t think I can afford $30 right now and I actually looked in the store but they didn’t have it"
BPD,f1anuw5,t3_d8hp4z,1569299836.0,"This is so great, thank you for sharing! I hope the positivity continues for you. What show are you enjoying?"
interracialdating,f1am14m,t1_f1alib2,1569298033.0,What the fuck? I think it’s only “famous” among white supremacist extremists... why would you comment this here?
BorderlinePDisorder,f1567u6,t3_d7rlnl,1569185337.0,I understand. “Your face looks like shit” from my father ten years ago and I still hear it.
BPD,f12g0fn,t3_d7mjmc,1569139814.0,"Welcome! Wishing you luck with your new therapist. It may take some time to find someone you truly “click” with, but be patient and open-minded because it is totally worth it once you do!You deserve to be understood and to feel better 💗"
BPD,f11et7v,t3_d7j54m,1569124609.0,YEP. Dealt with this all day. Cold showers are everything to me now

BPDSongs,f0xzebg,t3_d6eobi,1569055402.0,"Fucking amazing, thank you for sharing!!"
BPDSongs,f0xyv22,t3_d0pcuv,1569054498.0,This is sooo beautiful! I’m having such a hard time coping with the loss of someone who walked away from me and this just makes sense. PM me if you ever wanna talk about ways to move on. Always looking for advice. It’s been almost 5 years since he’s gone.
BPD,f0xx7qu,t1_f0xwv3c,1569051718.0,"That’s really amazing and courageous. I hope I can be like you. Was it through therapy that you were able to figure out how to leave them? Or did you find a way to do it on your own? What I’ve been running into with therapy is that I’ve made a lot of breakthroughs in the past few years; I feel like I understand my diagnosis (sorta) and I know where the trauma comes from and why it’s affecting me this way. It’s just that NO amount of understanding the causes has helped to alleviate the pain. If anything, understanding where it comes from has made me re-live the past and become more bitter, resentful, and sad about all of it. It also hurts to know that other people go through the same thing. I kinda wish I was the only one because it just sucks sooo much."
BPD,f0xwpdl,t1_f0xwjry,1569050898.0,"Thank you. I’ve been doing CBT therapy once a week for years and tried DBT once. I’m trying to be open-minded about the program, but I’m so concerned it won’t help because it’s outpatient and I’ll be coming home to a toxic situation every day. I just think at best, the program might help me cope with the shitty situation I’m in, but without any money, skills, or social/family support, I don’t see how I’ll ever be able to get to a stable and healthy environment to actually heal."
BPD,f0ur1fs,t1_f0u9jps,1568948229.0,"I love this! But how do you break free from the “isolate a little bit” part to get to the kindness part?? Isolating myself always feels like a horrible rabbit hole and I can’t force myself to stop. It eventually becomes so bad that I lose relationships permanently and have to start all over. Maybe this is outside the scope of this thread, but I’d just love to find the kind of strength you describe. It sounds amazing."
BPD,f0uqhlb,t1_f0um0tt,1568947780.0,"I feel this too! I tend to shape my identity around others, but because of my emotional extremes, my relationships never last very long. So this cycle is basically: attaching to a new person, absorbing all their interests, and then being abandoned and forced to repeat the process over again... I have “liked” so many different things for short periods of time that I’ve never immersed myself enough to appreciate anything fully and I can barely remember because it’s just been so much. Once it was art, then literature, politics, now sci fi movies, who knows what will be next? Unfortunately once I move to the next person/set of interests, I become so laser-focused on trying to bond with my new person and their passions that I forget almost everything about what I’ve appreciated in the past."
BPD,f0uptud,t3_d6n4wq,1568947259.0,That’s awesome. It sounds like you are finding a great reason to live. Just make sure you take care of yourself and your needs so you can stay on stable ground and make the most of your loving heart to help others 💗
lonely,f0lan8z,t1_f0kdsjg,1568707205.0,Beautiful and heartbreaking sentence 😭
BPD,f0l9b8o,t3_c9m2ry,1568705008.0,"This is so relatable and beautiful. I think this poem can make pwBPD feel less alone, and even more so could help loved ones understand the way our emotions can be so overpowering, even dominating, and the way these emotions feed off one another. Of course, the experience is different for everyone, but I’m sure this is pretty spot-on internal “sequence of events” (for lack of better words) that sooo many with BPD endure regularly, even daily. Thank you for sharing!💗"
BPD,f0l8iym,t3_c62dzx,1568703781.0,"Wow! I wrote something similar, though far less eloquent, years ago when I was deeply in love with the most special person I’ve ever known. I was in such darkness, and for some reason I started to think of them as “my moon.” This metaphor stuck with me and became very powerful in my writing. Even though I was experience some psychosis and a lot of it didn’t make sense, the connection between this person and the moon felt so real to me, and I am just blown away that you seem to have felt this connection as well and put it into words. THANK YOU for sharing. I feel less alone, and I’m sure you grasp the pain of losing your moon. I hope you are feeling comfort and peace nowadays. 💗"
