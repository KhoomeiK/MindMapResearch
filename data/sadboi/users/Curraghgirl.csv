Who is he supposed to be King Nobrains?
Speaking of ruining holidays he destroyed my Mother's Day last year so badly I actually sought refuge in a church. Sanctuary. I sat during the service with my head in my hands weeping because he had hammered me verbally for 9 hours. Of course he was there beside me. I swear the devil would be moved but not him. He stared at me with contempt the entire time.
I don't think they are human. Honestly."
witchcraft,fji9yf7,t3_fdi8yz,1583363196.0,"I would seriously like to ask something regarding egg magic. My late husband was Irish born. He was quite a bit older than me. He came from a rural background in a Gaeltacht area. He was a native speaker. He often spoke of Piseogue (sorry if the spelling is incorrect) magic done in his area of the country which was Waterford. 
Anyway we moved in with my parents for awhile in Chicago. Their neighbors on one side were Poles from Poland. The other side were from West Cork. 
Someone put an egg on our porch. No shell, perfect and unbroken yolk. My husband picked it up and threw it in the middle of the road. He thought it was a Piseogue. I know differently now decades later. He died shortly after and since my life has been a continuous stream of loss, grief, misfortune of every sort. Nothing I have done has ever changed it.
My question is is this an Irish form of negative magic? I guess if nothing else I would like to know who hated us do much to do such a thing. I am not looking for retribution. What good would that do? I can't bring back the dead or retrieve 25 years if my life. But I suppose of the two sets of neighbors mentioned I would like to know if the Irish lady in particular was most likely to have done this. She was very envious of my mother and of my happiness with my husband. It might have been someone else too. But I would appreciate knowing big this type of egg magic is practiced in Ireland. Thank you for your time and patience in reading this."

I am no Anglophile believe me. Very weird. The dream about Churchill was that the solution to whatever catastrophe was looking had been discovered by Churchill in his day. So that was what we all needed to do to solve whatever crisis was the issue.

A tall blonde lady dressed in peasant attire of long ago with her little boy about 5 years old. He was dressed in old style peasant garb and barefoot. It was cold and in the month of October. I remarked to my companion who was a resident Londoner of how shocked I was to see a child employed and in such scanty dress. I thought they were dressed this way for the tourists. She said they didn't have any such thing. She never saw them yet they were closer to her than they were to me. They were solid and very real looking. Yes they had old fashioned attire but I recall to this day how real they seemed. The woman's gaze even met mine. I think anything is possible when you're talking about the unknown.
