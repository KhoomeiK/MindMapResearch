StopSelfHarm,ffxbx4l,t3_evq233,1580321993.0,"Hey, listen. I will tell this from my own experience. The best thing you can you is to distract yourself. Sounds simple, but works most of the time if you really try. 

How to distract yourself depends on how strong is the urge. When it's just some random thoughts, make an immediate response in your head, saying ""i DON'T wanna do that"". It's good if you don't have any tools near, plus it works as a way to break the loop of thinking about self harm.

If you have the tools near and the urges are really strong, then do ANYTHING that could distract you. Turn on a video or a TV, play some games, watch some memes, etc. Use the distractions to your favour. You can even masturbat if that's okay with you (for real tho, i remember browsing some website and they considered it as a real way to distract yourself from urges).

It also works good if you have some app that tracks how long you've been clean. Just open the app and start looking at the timer. Count every second that passes until your urges fade at least a little bit.

Hope that helps"
