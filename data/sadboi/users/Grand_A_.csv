Also the word feminism is in itself, kind of sexist. I mean if they simply changed their name to Equalism and fought for Men's and Women's rights then who wouldn't be on board?

So as this match is about to start, all I can hear is this kid being mean to his brother, ""GO AWAY! YOU CAN PLAY AFTER!!"" and pushing his brother. I can hear the dad in the background telling him to stop being mean and telling the younger brother to wait his turn... So I got revenge for this kid at the expense of my Kill/death ratio. I spent the entire match running in front of this kid, crouching in front of him. Trapping him in corners. To the point this kid was nearly in tears so his dad came on the microphone and told me to piss off... Needless to say I did not... It was worth it just because I could hear the younger brother had gone quiet and was enjoying the show. When it was finally his turn I helped the younger brother by watching his back.
