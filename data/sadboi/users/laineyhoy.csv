Eastern Passage is one of my favorite places on earth because my grandparents took me there quite often as a small child. It is known to be affordable but bussing is a challenge I think.

FoodAddiction,fhhnin3,t3_f2v24g,1581608037.0,Its a vicious cycle isnt it? :( i think the main thing is that you know what is happening and therefore can be more likely to gain control over yourself. Food is a temporary high as you know. I am guilty of not caring and giving into the in the moment high...however I know that I always feel like shit afterwards.... thinking long term goals is helpful for me and maybe can be helpful for you. Perhaps you can write your long term goals down somewhere to become a happier you?

Have you tried to get together with the friends from high school? Something like "" hey, we havnt seen each other in a while, wanna come over for movies and snacks?""  If they dont get back to you, that is okay too, time to move on perhaps. I don't know how your autism affects you but perhaps you could join a social group to find a group of people so you arent as isolated?? I would also suggest getting a counsellor to chat through your emotions with since it seems you may not have anyone who you can do that with."
mentalhealth,fgpkcsi,t3_ezs7cz,1581006541.0,"It sounds like you have a very unhealthy relationship with food and also maybe some body dysmorphia. This can be very common. Someone i know struggles like you do in some ways and she was anorexic. Does the bmi scale say you are underweight? If so, you would have a better chance of getting diagnosed i think. My friend was not diagnosed because she wasnt underweight even though she would go days without eating as punishment to herself. She continues to struggle with the fact doctors wouldnt help her. Today, she has strategies that she uses to develop a better relationship with food. One of them that i notice is that she snacks little bits like i mean nibbles, throughout the day. 
I truly suggest you go to some doctors and a psychiatrist who can help you work through those urges and negative feelings. If one of them doesnt believe you /want to work with how you feel then on to the next one! 

I hope you find some help soon and i hope you will soon realize that numbers on a scale are just numbers. You are FAR from being obese. Relationships with food are difficult, i wish you balance and self love :)"

I do have high expectations of people sometimes which isnt always great HOWEVER in a world where everyone is stating they create ""safe spaces"" and ""you can come to me"" etc. They also need to be prepared to hold up to that. In the future i will use that quote you said when i feel like spiraling to get me through it better. However i remain consistent with my opinion on the matter."

mentalhealth,fgnk6l0,t1_fgnix7c,1580946566.0,"Yes group chats are complicated. I think communication in general is complex. I think my biggest issue which was adressed in that above quote is that it is so phoney when people SAY things like ""im always here for you"" etc. When really they leave you hanging which i feel is what occured in that situation. I feel as though people like to feel like good people and say they care but in reality they dont show it. Which is confusing. It is annoying that people do not know how to care. Perhaps boundaries, perhaps ignorance. There are many reasons but at the end of the day i see it as pretending."
mentalhealth,fgnitzf,t1_fgni8dw,1580945774.0,"Also, you come from a place of judging of that moment rather than how to proceed. Which also can be unhelpful."
mentalhealth,fgni8dw,t1_fgnhs57,1580945430.0,"Im actually really surprised that you do that because to me, you come off as arrogant. In what way was it helpful at all to state that group chats are not a good place to say that. To me, that is a very unhelpful comment. What you could have said would be "" hmm maybe next time you could privately chat one of them to explain what is going on?"" But also in that moment when im spiraling in anxiety and everyone is getting mad at me in the group chat for not attending, i could not just ignore them. Moving forward yes, i would have done a lot differently. But in that moment there wasnt much i was prepared for."
mentalhealth,fgngn7c,t1_fgng83w,1580944467.0,"Nope, many people challenged me and were also able to be challenged. However when i challenge you, you became defensive. You use a specific language that comes across as thinking you know everything."

Some who agree with me and some who don't but who were able to have decent conversations looking at all aspects. Youve been the only one who I've had this experience with.
mentalhealth,fgnfbvz,t1_fgnf3x8,1580943655.0,Well obviously not. I love how you are assuming everything and love telling people what to do like youre some kind of therapist yourself. Perhaps you should take a moment go realise you don't know everything. Perhaps ask more questions rather than make statements. So what youre saying is that i should have not said anything at all and just ignore everyone when they were expecting me somewhere. Seems very inauthentic.
mentalhealth,fgnejeq,t1_fgnbxrs,1580943178.0,"Never expected them to. I panicked about it and explained that i was panicking about it and then no one responded to me. I didnt expect them to read my mind or change anything. I expected them to be empathetic that i was struggling but instead they ignored me and therefore made me spiral. It sucks that it sent me that way but it did. In my eyes, when someone explains their struggles, you could at least have the decency to respond in any way."
mentalhealth,fgna8i4,t1_fgn8g6r,1580940658.0,"I need concrete plans in my life to keep me feeling positive and i use my strategies really well such as agendas and planning things myself and talking things through openly with people i trust. Only gets out of hand like twice a year, this was one of them. Mainly because i felt like an outcast. I should add that i hve tried to contact numerous psychologists and only one has gotten back to me and my insurance won't cover his specific practise. Just to make myself more aware and learn how to control the bit of anxiety i do have."
mentalhealth,fgmay1g,t1_fgkkq8t,1580921160.0,"I completely get that, however i explained everything i was feeling with no response. I dont think you need a diagnosis to feel anxiety. Anxiety can be a natural human emotion. I explained the situation and that it gave me anxiety blah blah and why  i feel the way i feel and they didnt answer me. That is the problem. But just to add, i have tried contacting like 5 psychologists to figure out my random anxieties/traumas etc. And no one has gotten back to me except 1 who my insurance doesnt cover. Sucks, still looking though."

Which i included in the message to my family. I believe empathy is one of the most important values in the world. And demonstarting it can look different depending on the situation however, with online messaging there is only really one way to SHOW you care. Which is responding. Also, maybe you should assume less. You are basing some of what you are saying on what you think i said to them. Never did i instruct them to do anything."
mentalhealth,fgiuzom,t1_fgis2jo,1580831497.0,I dont think anyone here is asking for care 24/7. I think we are asking for basic human empathy.

mentalhealth,fgit3qg,t1_fgip2gm,1580830315.0,I literally sent them an explanation explaining myself. Did you even read the post tho? LOL
mentalhealth,fgisrs3,t1_fgimzmj,1580830106.0,"I appreciate your response and i definitely agree with some things you said. I think mostly what the concerning part is is that i believe people are not willing to learn how to care and lack basic empathy. I think peoples egos get into it and they want to SAY they are a caring person but dont practise it and also can become defensive. Yes, this could be from lack of skill however, i think it is because they are riding the wave and following the cool trend to say they care about mental health without putting any effort in to educate themselves. When i explained myself to my family i was basically saying like "" yeah i know im a bit fucked up but in my life i need concrete plans to feel a plan is real etc. And its just who i am im unable to be spontaneous etc."" kind of thing. To me, it was not a huge concerning event. It was me being real and vulnerable to admit it. It may just be me and perhaps some anxiety but if anyone cared about my feelings they could have at least said SOMETHING."
mentalhealth,fgirq0a,t1_fgikuga,1580829425.0,Oh no :( im so sad that was your experience. I hope you find whatever strategies you need for this world and a few shoulders to lean on when it gets tough. Good luck ❤✌

However, fakeness is a real pet peeve of mine and i feel that people are just creating this illusion that we all want to help those with mental health but in reality i think people subconsciously do it to feel better about themselves.

mentalhealth,fgiquk4,t1_fgif29b,1580828851.0,Having your own boundaries is important too! I think just showing empathy or just sitting with someone is good. No need to try to fix anyone. Most people just want to know others dont think they are crazy and to know they are cared about.
mentalhealth,fgipx84,t1_fgi94gj,1580828226.0,"I feel as though you have not read the post in the way it was intended. In no way did i ask them to change what they were doing.

But after i explained my anxiety about structure and knowing im a bit fucked in regards to it LITERALLY silence after ongoing communication. To me any decent person would have shown just a bit of empathy like ""oh shit, hopefully next time.""

OR "" ah crap, didnt realize you struggled like this, dont worry about it. No stress for ditching"" i dont think at any moment in my post did i ask anyone to walk on eggshells or read my mind.

There are people with cerebral palsey who want to go out. People who have mobility issues for one reason or another. There are people who are paralysed who may be trying to get out there again.
