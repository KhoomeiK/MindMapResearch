TheSilphRoad,fqsfqu1,t1_fqs9id6,1589606056.0,Hopefully not before some of the restrictions are lifted. I would love to just go out and bypass incense totally but for safety and because of restrictions its not entirely possible. Im ok with a premium incense but would still prefer to just go out where Pokémon spawn regularly.

TheSilphRoad,fqorrwk,t1_fqnkzar,1589522950.0,I do agree and I'm a bad hoarder. I keep very unnecessary pokemon and I'm still not full. I just a few days ago went through just johto looking for ones I dont need and cut back by 150. Even as a collector who wants to have one of everything (including pikachu in every hat and every eeveelution in a flower crown) its possible to cut down and make plenty of room for pokemon you'll actually use.

Eyebrows don't move up your head. It just doesn't work that way. Shes perfectly fine either way but its not wrong to be honest about seeing the changes."

TheSilphRoad,fpqcbrl,t1_fpq2u6n,1588819634.0,I spend whatever is necessary to get what I want out of the game and won't keep doing it if they don't continue to accommodate free to play. What if I get to the point where I can't spend on the game? I've always valued the fact that this game is so great for playing free. Im not going to want to spend on a game that makes me feel like the only way to keep going is to spend money.

vegetarian,fpj4g1j,t3_gcyuas,1588656317.0,I recently started feeling the same moral issues with meat.
