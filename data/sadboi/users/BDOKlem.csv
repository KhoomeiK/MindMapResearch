They have kind of boxed themselves in with the whole Midgar-only game. Would be better if they had perhaps made the game end around arriving at Costa del Sol and cut all the fluff chapters and endless walkways from the Midgar chapters. Then they could have split it into 3 parts easily. 

Chapter 1: Midgar to Costa del Sol. Final battle against Jenova on the boat. 

Chapter 2: Costa del Sol to City of the Ancients (Aerith death). Would also include Wutai and Yuffie arc. Vincent obtainable in Nibelheim. 

Chapter 3: Awakening weapons/first crater, submarine, rocket flight, return to Midgar, return to crater. Weapon fights optional end game content."
