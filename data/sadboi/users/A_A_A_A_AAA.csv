What I haven't been through is having a solid friend, person, whatever, there for me; one that doesn't promote negativity, be it on purpose or not. I haven't had that and it's awful to not able to relate with that, because let me be clear: depression, anxiety ADHD are all two sides of the same coin and by not having that sense of belonging it severely impedes my mental and overall well being. I am only 23 but I haven't felt connected with anyone in so long, if ever. Strangely enough, what I want is what you said : A connection. Not romantic, but just a ""I understand completely what you mean and are going through: I am here to listen"".
