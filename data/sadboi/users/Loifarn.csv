The reason we're seeing less content now that we have over the last expansion and a half is due to the majority of the development team working on Shadowlands due to BfA's core mechanics failing (Islands, Warfronts, Azerite) which is the sensible decision to make (For both players, devs and the company).

The reason we're seeing worse content now is that the company is in the middle of being re-structured in terms of how many heads do what. This is necessary for growth and stability for the company and it's products. (Though you can of course make the greed argument, but if you have department A twiddling thumbs and department B worked to burnout, you might wanna re-organize.)

In terms of software development it's can often be faster to make something new than try to fix something broken, this is why we have too many systems.

We can and should provide as much constructive criticism as we can (we're getting 'un-pruned' in shadowlands as a result f.ex.) but for us to do a good job with that we need to stay informed and understand their decisions.

+1 (Though ffs blizzard, you **know** that keeping us informed is the best choice you have, get going with the dev talks again!)

+2 (For concrete greed examples that development can't explain away: WOD/BFA being released incomplete, Cash shop in a sub game, over-priced character services and the entirety of WC3 Reforged. We have plenty to pick from :P)"

- Modern IDEs makes indentation a non-issue (VSCode and PyCharm to name two) 
- It is arguably one of the fastest languages to write features in. (few lines, big impact. example: requests lib.). 
- You can also build for Linux, Mac, Windows, iOS and android.
