I'll try my best to summarize one of them.

0.6 seconds left and my best friend is up by 1 point. The game has a mechanic where you can catch shots in place of blocking in certain situations. My best friend got greedy and he still threw the ball to rub it in my face. I jumped, caught it and shot it to win the game. He didn't know I was mashing X to catch and shoot. We both erupted in laughter after. He was so salty."

------------

I don't know if I am allowed to answer this since this is /ask women. But since this is about depression, I wanna give some input on what dug me out of my shit hole last year.

Time, patience and realizing that going to a doctor should've been the first thing to do. 

If someone comes up to you and down plays depression just try not to let it get you down so much. Because, before last year I was one of those people that thought depression was just being really really sad, which is very ignorant.
And I encountered something like this from a very good friend and it hurt so much, but we're good now lol.

Anyways the main thing on top of time and patience is I turned back into my old hobbies.

The first month of my depression, I spent surfing. I took the whole freaking month off lol.
Then after that I started working on music. Then I turned to the gym and changed my eating habits. I actually lost about 50lbs now since last year. Now I am super into basketball again.

Also I've been playing A L O T of Tetris Effect, that really helps with my stress levels after work lol

One thing to remember though. My journey is different than yours, you can try what I did but it may not work for you coz we're all unique. Just how our bodies are all different, the chemical imbalance within you can be different as well.

Also watch a crap ton of those try not to laugh videos. Coz you're bound to bust out laughing at some point in the future. Some of them are stupid but some of them melted my sadness away even for just a few minutes.

I hope you feel better soon and always talk to positive friends and families and never bottle things in. 

You Got This!"

AskReddit,es5vpp4,t3_c5sr3a,1561630812.0,"One of my best friends told me that I used my depression and my suicide attempt last year as a crutch. Even though I actually avoided giving him details because prior to this, he went through **** and I felt like I wasn't there for him completely. So I didn't tell him much coz I didn't want to burden him, yet he found a way to say this.

In case you're wondering.
1) we're still friends and I made the first move to actually approach and start the friendship again.
2) I was so tempted to burn his house after he said that. (I know I'm crazy, I didn't though and probably wouldn't lol)
3) I approached him after I was diagnosed with BiPolar disorder, I figured my anger and rage was unreasonable and thought it was probably coz of being bi polar. 
4) Everything is good and I am OK. I joined a gym and lost 40lbs. I chanelled my anger towards him and used it in the gym.

If you have a family member who is depressed, sometimes sitting with them in silence while having coffee is enough. Sometimes, you don't have to say anything, just be there. One of my best buddies actually did this. Every Friday to Sunday, we'd go to Denny's for breakfast at 3am, I really felt the love even though we didn't speak much."
