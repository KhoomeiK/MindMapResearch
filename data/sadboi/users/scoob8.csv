I love it, I may have got the meaning wrong but it really hit home for me, The structure, especially the rhyme scheme is great as well. As much as I'm not well versed in Harry Potter lore, I loved the reference ( I may be wrong, but I think you were referencing Harry potter right?) it might be lost or some and isolate them but I, personally, loved how it highlights the chase for creativity. great work and keep sharing!"

The pace is wonderful and makes the reader sound confused and as if they are only grasping their surroundings. Maybe you could split the poem into stanzas and with the line 'who are they' maybe add a question mark. I also think the splitting into stanzas could highlight the split from reality. Loved it though, keep up the good work and keep sharing brilliant poetry like this."

Also he doesnt  proclaim himself as a new jesus and hasnt started a church, he is an active Christian spokesperson and atm he seems to be acting really stable which is great in my opinion, like when was the last crazy thing kanye did? like two years ago. He's separated himself from politics and is actively trying to become a better person. Look at a recent interview and see how much progress he seems to have made. Its genuinely inspiring."
bipolar,fol6wag,t1_fol64em,1587856060.0,"Kanye has been showing symptoms, especially mania for years. Practically since the begining of his career, I mean just look at the Taylor swift thing. But, sure he would be just thought of as being crazy if he didn't have the money and privilege, and I'm not supporting all of what he has said, but just imagine being manic and psychotic for everyone to watch. I mean, cut him some slack. Don't completely forgive him, but at least try to understand him. I think someone who is literally going through the worst and damaging parts of this illness in front of everyone, might actually show people what literal hell we go through on a basically daily basis"
bipolar,fol5lr2,t1_fol4wt7,1587855337.0,"of course he would be. Heck imagine being a billionaire and being manic, just imagine the shit that would happen. I'm not saying all his behaviour is justified. But imagine the shit you've said being while manic and psychotic broadcasted to the world. They literally provoke him when he's in an episode. 

Also, he wasnt born into immense wealth he has now, he worked for it through his creative endevours, which just inspires me, because if a guy who struggles with this fucking living hell of an illness can succeed in the way he has, why cant I?"
bipolar,fol41gr,t1_fol3jxq,1587854462.0,"I dont know if he said that, and I'm not agreeing with him here, but alot of us fear that meds will make us less creative and have probably said similar things in the past, especially in manic episodes. I know i have. As much as I dont agree with the statement, I can totally see why someone with the disorder would say that.

I used to have loads of friends before this illness got the better of me, but after it got intense people obviously tend to ignore me or have separated themselves from me, and everyone knows I have this disorder because I've written about it on Instagram while manic.
