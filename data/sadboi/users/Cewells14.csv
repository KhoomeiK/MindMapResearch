Well we get going, cake's in the oven pretty quick and we're working on cookies. Wholesome friend wants to make them into Ts for the name of the building we live in. Oh that's a great idea! my roommate and I say and we shape them and get them into the oven.

When they came out my friend was so proud she called her brother out to see them. He just said ""you know what those look like...?"" And that was when we realized we'd made two batches of dick shaped cookies to give out to our floor.

I couldn't stop laughing for a straight five minutes or so. The best part was just that none of us realized what we were doing.

Some people need to go farther from home to keep their focus and to really connect with others on campus. Some people are better suited for a college closer to family. I'd suggest reflecting a bit and determining what you want and need, not just in a school, but in a home. Most likely, you're going to be spending the next four years in a relatively new town, so think about what kind of place you'd be most comfortable in. That is, unless you're planning on commuting.

I felt really stuck in high school, waking up early every day and spending 7-8 hours in one building, learning the same things as everyone else just to pass through the system. Now I'm deciding what classes I take and when. If I want to go for a walk at 1:30 pm, nothing is stopping me. If I want to stay up until 4 am eating cookie dough with my friends, I can do that. That's where a lot of the fun comes in... living with other people your age who are also free for the first time.

You might miss out on this last part quite a bit, but having a good ""college experience"" is completely dependent on what you're looking for. Even if you do go to a CC, you will probably have a lot more independence which will be nice. And saving money and time will just make it easier to have fun in other ways after school."
