> Psychopathy is not synonymous with behavioral histories of criminality or the categorical diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, although it is often a correlate of both in severe cases 

   
This [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013700609001547?via%3Dihub)  found the following

  


> As expected, the results suggested positive correlations between narcissistic, antisocial personalities and scores of psychopathy (from 0.36 to 0.63); paranoid personality was less expected (from 0.32 to 0.47). Borderline personality was associated with both the total score of psychopathy (0.24) and the score of factor 2 (0.30). Linear regression analysis revealed that the antisocial and paranoid personalities predicted the total score (*R*2 = 38%) and the factor 2 (*R*2 = 45%) of the PCL-R. Antisocial and narcissistic personalities predicted factor 1 (*R*2 = 22%). However, in the different models, contrary as predicted, the borderline personality was not a significant predictor. 

  
There were strong correlations between a number of personality disorders and psychopathy. Antisocial and narcissistic would of course seemingly have the highest correlation. What is also implied by the study is that not all psychopaths have antisocial personality disorder, although they do highly correlate of course.

sociopath,fl1970b,t1_fl0q1j4,1584724445.0,"When studies gauge the efficacy of the MMPI-2's ability to diagnose psychopathy they still most commonly check PCL-R and PPI correlations. Most typically PCL-R too. The MMPI-2 is a more versatile assessment, so that is why I assume it is being used standardly. Most studies I found had demonstrated a correlation with the MMPI-2' psychopathy assessment and other like tests, it is worth noting that same did not though. I can link those if you want. In my observations  the PCL-R is still used dramatically more than the MMPI-2 in assessing psychopathy in research settings. I dont know exactly why that may be the case but that is what I have noticed. The PPI is used rather more commonly too

And I checked that reference link and it simply goes to a book written by an author with unknown creditentials. The book itself being about getting a normative score on the PCL-R. I found a specific paper that cited specific studies concerning these discrepancies you have noticed though. There are still many studies on the other side that would support the PCL-R so it seems to be a bit of a controversial issue in psychiatry right now. And i also saw that Hare had responded to the contrary studies claiming the test-givers were either improperly trained or utilizing personal biases which were breaking validity of the test. I havent actually seen any studies that put the MMPI-2 under the same scrutiny as the PCL-R in regards to psychopathy. So it is possible there could be similar issues concerning that test as well. I havent found a single researcher that  has made the argument that the MMPI-2 is actually better at assessing psychopathy either."

I have though seen studies checking for correlations between traits among the two tests to check MMPI-2's validity. If there is any study that checks those two tests against each other for construct validity in general, I have yet to find it on google. If you have a link to that too I would also hope you can share that

The MMPI-2 tests for more generalized aspects of a person's personality and mood dispositions. The PCL-R is dedicated to checking only for psychopathy traits. It would make sense to use the MMPI-2 in more settings than the PCL-R though because it gives a broader overview of a person rather than a simple score of their level of psychopathic traits."

If you have some newer research I would love to take a look at it. And as far as the mmpi-2 test is designed, it seems to be assessing pretty much the same traits in regards to its psychopathy section.

Or even a combination of the above stated reasons. If you don't fall into those categories a psychologist likely won't diagnose you a PD even if one would seemingly be present. Considering the lengths to which the condition will impair somebody, treatment is truly not a bad idea for many. And a diagnosis is not at all required to get treated for ths symptoms .  Even if the personality types are resistant to it, therapy can still be worth it(assuming you have good insurance or alot of cash ).

 The point of the theories is to identify personalities that impair wellness and functioning, if there is no impairment one could argue the traits are subclinical to begin with. There are no cool person points to be awarded for a psychopathy/aspd diagnosis so it shouldn't be something to quite seek out simply  for the sake of it."

I'm guessing because I had personality disorder traits. Now I cannot think of anything prosocial on a large scale without a large degree of resentment. At this point I would want to be Ledger's joker. I know it is terribly juvenile and largely emotional reasoning but i can back it up with the common detached reasoning others do. It doesn't help I am also bipolar. I was diagnosed PD stuff alongside the bipolar so it doesn't all stem from that either 

How did you feel about that recent joker movie? I loved it"
NPD,fkjt7zi,t3_firiq2,1584258597.0,Would you prefer to be batman or the joker? (Bale batman and Ledger joker )
aspd,fkjsz6z,t1_fkjsorj,1584258278.0,"Yeah. I have done some abusive things in my past as well. Being naturally disagreeable doesn't inherently mean though that a person  needs to consistently say offensive things for the simple sake of it. I was once like that in middle school and high school but I have definitely grown out of that. If these posters are in similar places in their development then I can understand,  still belittles the value this sub can really give though . After a while sub might else well just be called r/edgybullshit"
aspd,fkjs6hv,t3_fixi6w,1584257235.0,"Yeah I do find it somewhat silly to be edgy for the simple sake of it. If saying all sorts of vulgar words and offensive statements  for the sheer shock factor of it feels to someone the best use of their time , they are free to do so. I just can imagine the sub being put to better use than that"

Posting an ad on a dating site looking for some aspie girls of the dark triad  :p  very interesting idea, I cannot say I have tried it. And oh. I use to light alot of stuff on fire as a teen, I got arrested once but nothing quite happened because I was a minor

Ha oh we have very similar conditions in that regards. High five indeed! Last time I went manic I got pretty violent though and got arrested xP"
aspd,fkgskx4,t1_fkgs440,1584172262.0,"lol yeah I'm sure this forum is one of the best place to express such self love :D Special in ways considered bad by normies? Sounds interesting lol But yes, I feel it. Much people without any such diagnosis exhibit disregard or outright judgement on the PD peoples. 

Hmm, an aspiechick without morals.... sounds appealing. I'll see what I can do about finding such a girl then. Welp, my diagnosis is technically ""Cluster B NOS(Not otherwise specified)"" alongside bipolar1. So the psychologist really didn't know what to do with me regarding my personality lol. I haven't felt like dealing the ramifications of getting a full diagnosis at this point so I just talk about my traits without labels when I go on subs like this one."
aspd,fkgrnk5,t3_fhzc0x,1584171035.0,"Most people would seem to want to exemplify the traits that our popular often rewards or otherwise glorifies to large extent. A shallow/calm affect, confidence(even to the point of arrogance), a cunning mentality, ruthlessness, aggressiveness and other such traits are given high respect by many parts of our culture. These traits are often in full display in one form or another in both protagonists and antagonists in popular films. These traits are prized in a business environment. There are many rebellious subcultures that seem to even worship the embodiment of these traits.  


 Many nonpsychopaths/nonsociopaths take note of this, and want to look at themselves as being some sort of powerful creature. Falsely identifying as a psychopath/sociopath could counter feelings of shame the person may hold in regards to feeling powerless or inadequate. It can also make a person feel they are more unique in the grand scheme of things, because these personalities are comparably rarer than a neurotypical. And of course there is also the reasoning that person can justify being a terrible person by saying it is some condition that is causing them to act in such in a manner  


That is my take on it at least."
aspd,fkgqztv,t1_fkgqlba,1584170183.0,"You are welcome. A truly honest narcissist? You must gain quite a high amount of enemies or otherwise people who dislike you. Most people really hate when someone openly feels they are superior to them. Yeah, you do sound quite special ! Many npd may say as much, but maybe they are just the delusional ones lol

Well I have been with people like me, we typically collide too much. I just want a girl now who will just go along with the flow at this point. I had been with a codependent girl at one time before and it was pretty nice :3 Just gotta find a better one this time"
NPD,fkgqji3,t3_fid83z,1584169593.0,Getting with borderlines to emotionally abuse them is a bad idea for a number of reasons. The one reason I expect you would care more for though is the self destructive aggression they often carry. Many borderlines will cause a lot of harm to their own life if it means letting out some aggression on someone that has emotionally hurt them. Meaning they can be very reckless with their vendettas. They are personalities that can be quite abusive themselves. And the truth is that narcissists can be just as bad if not worse than borderlines. So it is just emotional reasoning to pick favorites here.

sociopath,fkgb5ae,t1_fkg9rfu,1584154659.0,"Oh really cool. Art is very powerful for therapeutic purposes. I'm certain many cluster B personalities can benefit greatly from the mindful practices such as you have mentioned. Most of my own aggressive outbursts would seem to come from my bipolar, I wonder how the same methodology could apply to my own issues. My last manic episode I attacked a few people and threatened some others. I would prefer not to do so in the future as I lost many friends as a result of my behavior and was briefly incarcerated as well. My meds only do so much, the rest would need to come down to my own practices. I do actually create art(music and light graphic design), so I could try to utilize your own strategies to see how effective they may be. I haven't had much problems controlling my behavior as of lately in that regards but I should definitely practice as much healthy therapies as I can.  I don't want to get myself into anything again in the case my moods get unstable."
sociopath,fkg38d9,t1_fkg0ci1,1584148853.0,"Yeah totally, I would definitely be interested in that. 

I was very intrigued by it because one of the traits of modern psychopathy theories is a distinct lack of neurosis. I sincerely wonder how this research would fit those models. The article even suggested that the basic theory would need some restructuring if not outright replacement. 

hmm, pretty interesting experience you are describing as well. The Jungian shadow is very fascinating in how it would relate to personality disorders, and cluster B/psychopathy in particular. You could have very well have confronted your subconscious feelings of shame and resolved them. I cannot say for certain in any way, it was your own experience and not mine. I don't know too much of Jung's theories but I feel I am digging into my own shadow of sorts in the current moment."
sociopath,fkfl7nv,t1_fkfhesb,1584136881.0,"Hmm, very interesting. I had at one time been diagnosed borderline personality, and then the diagnosis was changed to cluster B personality disorder NOS(Not otherwise specified), this on top of bipolar disorder. For comparison, I can definitely feel self-centered shame as I had described before. When I feel unable to control a situation that matters to me, I can get pretty down about that. I never feel like a ""bad"" person, but I may feel weak or inept and that can get to me. I really don't know what personality disorder have truly but I'm rather sure I don't have BPD. Either way, I have read shame is pretty central to the more typical cluster B personalities. It is far more ambiguous for psychopathic personalities so that really evokes my curiosity.  

Here is a [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22948170) that found (juvenile) psychopathic personalities to have unconscious shame(whatever that is exactly) and externalized coping strategies for such shame. Unfortunately that link only gives an abstract. 

Below is a quote from a seperate source 

>Gullhaugen found few significant differences between psychopaths and her ""normal"" group when, in her own study of Norwegian prisoners, she examined the ability to experience a wide range of emotions. The differences that she found showed that psychopaths generally experience more negative emotions, such as irritability, hostility, and shame. But they do not feel guilty.

Here is the link to an article of that [study](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/07/120713122925.htm)

There was a specific paper I unfortunately cannot find that put forth a large amount of effort to argue that psychopathic personalities can feel shame. I am going to continue looking for that but I cannot guarantee I will find it again. Most information out there seems to be just laymen articles masquerading as little experts on psychopathic personalities."
sociopath,fkf1nf6,t1_fkdspo3,1584125208.0,"Well the papers I saw that argued for such suggested the experience of shame can be a more shallow and externalized  manifestation in a psychopathic personality. But who knows, it is all very speculative. I havent found any MRI experiments conducted regarding shame. 

Shame (or lack thereof) is currently not a trait in the psychopathic personality theories. The pcl-r, and the ppi dont mention it explicitly. But Cleckley had in fact noted a lack of shame in his model of psychopathy. Why the more modern models of psychopathy dont include shame within their listings of traits is definitely fascinating assuming I'm not just misunderstanding the trait descriptions to begin with 

I can look up those specific papers if you are interested."
sociopath,fkdmqq0,t1_fkdm1fj,1584085204.0,"Well that is a good mentality about things. What I described is just a common reaction of shame many people may experience when they reach such situations. Most of the time for that type of shame to activate there must be some sense of responsibility for losing control over the situation of course. 

 I just have been looking into the  experience of shame within psychopathic personalities. The literature is somewhat divided on this. Some researchers are actually claiming that shame may central to psychopathic personalities. But I don't know,the research is currently rather limited and it is difficult to measure."
sociopath,fkdkis9,t1_fkdk8w6,1584082403.0,"What about self centered shame like ""I feel unable to control the situation so thusly I may be inept"" ? If not. How do you feel in important situations where you may not be able to control the outcome?"
sociopath,fkd6xt0,t1_fkcspg4,1584069941.0,How would you define shame?
bipolar,fk5nh6k,t1_fk5n31j,1583884132.0,"Yeah , I feel very similar in my experience of shame. I just generally stay quiet for the most part but the internal experience is quite similar. It does suck there is currently no cure for bipolar. And I have a very intense manifestation of it myself so I am stuck on meds for the rest of my life most likely. Those meds have been hard on me throughout the years"
