You don’t need to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders by finding worth in helping others. Only you can find that worth. There might not be any clear cut meaning to living but there doesn’t have to be, it’s what you make it. It might feel like you’ll never find it but it’s possible. I don’t know if this is what you need to here, but I know how it can be. It seems as though there is no reason for me to be alive when I’m doing nothing with my life, that someone else should have gotten a chance at this.
