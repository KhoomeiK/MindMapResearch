ehlersdanlos,fl5kdfx,t3_fmom26,1584838812.0,"YES! All the time exactly what you‚Äôre describing, but -


I also have Chiari and it‚Äôs a known symptom of that - it‚Äôs an EDS comorbidity which is why I bother mentioning it (sorry for the novel, tried to list what I felt was relevant to include in my Chiari summary)

(if you‚Äôre not familiar - skip this paragraph if you are - for whatever reason, the skull cannot fully accommodate the size of the brain, so the brain sticks out of the skull through the bottom - through the formen magnum into cervical spine/neck territory - so basically the cerebellum tonsils part of the brain is being compressed by that opening and scar tissue builds up and fluid flow can be disrupted, generally the more time scar tissue has to build up, the more severe the symptoms - BUT not always - the scar tissue build up is what makes it progressive, really)

Symptoms info that might be helpful: 

      - biggest symptoms are headaches and coordination. balance issues (but there‚Äôs a lot more) you can be asymptomatic, if you‚Äôre asymptomatic you can get symptoms any time as it‚Äôs progressive without surgery 

      - If you find you get headaches from valsalva movements (coughing, sneezing) or notice a difference in how you feel laying down vs standing or sitting up (usually in terms of pain and dizziness) you might want to look into it 

      - If you don‚Äôt have any of those issues, you probably don‚Äôt need to look into it - if you want more info lmk or pm me

PS - since you have EDS, if you ever get an MRI due to any symptoms you might be experiencing make sure you are standing upright for the MRI or you can‚Äôt rule out Chiari (Chiarians with EDS, and vice versa, have like a sinking issue where it doesn‚Äôt always show when laying down) - obviously if they find another cause and the treatment for any particular cause helps, then you don‚Äôt have to push for a standing MRI"

Colorguard,fimwgih,t1_fij5vi8,1582549233.0,"I remember this comment being on a completely different post. 

Something that helps me is when I focus on performing and looking pretty and are my arms straight and knees pointed, I feel more relaxed about the technical choreography and not messing up during the show (helps with technical accuracy as well, because I usually rely on muscle memory and that can cause bad habits). Like I can toss one handed and tend to do it all the time (I don‚Äôt really need to pull down with my other hand in almost all cases, depending on how the flag is weighted). 

If there are ‚Äúhits‚Äù or a hard change in direction like that isn‚Äôt flow-y - I like staccato them (accent them if you will, squeeze the pole and exaggerate - there‚Äôs the word - the stop almost - not quite a pause though). 

Honestly I wish more people would do this. When I watch a talented and very technical spinner, it‚Äôs so good - but the dance and less precise movements not treated like ‚Äúoh god, here‚Äôs the 45‚Äù *perfect form* i know I‚Äôm a nit-picky coach, but it‚Äôs like a pet peeve almost for me.

Also, you‚Äôve probably heard this before, when you make a mistake absolutely do not try to ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù and finish the move you didn‚Äôt start on time or missed or messed up on. This will only make you further behind and it‚Äôs more noticeable to judges/everyone else. If you act like nothing happened and jump into the next place in the work, half the time no one even sees it until you watch the recording. If you‚Äôre out of step, you can do a chass√© to quickly fix it and not draw attention to it (easier said than done for myself). 

If you catch a toss a little funky and don‚Äôt ‚Äústick the landing‚Äù if you will, this will work if it‚Äôs during a solo. Keep spinning. Your equipment wants to keep going because of how you caught it and like do a spin and get back into the choreography at whatever comes next with the music. Helps more with weapons imo.

Also also, do guard for fun sometimes where it‚Äôs okay to mess up and you can laugh about it (if you can) - that‚Äôs what really made a difference for me. Did it for fun in college and by the end we‚Äôd be like - dude, I was so hungover for that show I legit dropped my flag for the dumbest reason. Once, my naked flag pole end went up my stupid crop top band person jacket made of cardboard. I could not do the next move until I got it out so I skipped it and it was pretty hilarious."

I noticed this from severe Chiari headaches and then surgery mostly got rid of them. Then I‚Äôd have these little headaches - legit was telling my mom about it and asked ‚Äúis this what normal people headaches feel like?‚Äù The pain feels completely different and doesn‚Äôt bother me as much unless it gets severe.

To make a long, long story short lol - I decided I have enough evidence/etc from research to be seriously evaluated for eds (I‚Äôve been tested for like everything too - it‚Äôs never lupus - even my aunt with lupus is being told jk it‚Äôs not lupus right now). 

I scheduled an appointment with a rheumatologist and said it was for autoimmune symptoms (not a lie really, just not as specific as I could have been). When I got there literally all I said was I want to be evaluated for ehlers-Danlos (like I‚Äôm 28, I ain‚Äôt playin anymore). The lady in training gave me shit for it. 

The doc gets in the room (he was great, seemed completely unbiased about any of it) and looks at my bruises/significant bruise photos. He asked me to touch my thumb to my forearm. Then I bent at the waist to touch the floor without bending my knees. Then he says okay, never do that again.

Then he gets more specific - asked for previous dislocations and things. Has me do the neurologist dance (walk in a line, stand up + close eyes + see if you fall over). And so on.

He diagnosed it and ordered tests. He even mentioned that they would need to do more research (idk if I have ever had another doctor openly admit that they aren‚Äôt omnipotent in the ways of medicine - he was a cool dude).

A lot of those with eds are also diagnosed with fibromyalgia as well - also my muscles can get so stiff that my joints don‚Äôt even bother me or I don‚Äôt notice if they do. I also have more tendinitis type issues and only more recently started having noticeable joint pain often (I‚Äôm 29). 

I can scratch pretty much anywhere on my back, but I‚Äôve had so much muscle stiffness that I lost flexibility for periods of time.

My thumbs have always been very liberal in their ‚Äúdouble-jointed‚Äù tendencies - it has never hurt before this past year and now it feels wrong, is the best way to describe it for me. Before I could move them around without pain or issues.  

Even when my thumbs bother me, it‚Äôs mostly because of repeated use issues (tendinitis) - it feels wrong and uncomfortable like I need to crack the joint, so I keep messing with it until forever which makes the pain noticeable (I have a high pain tolerance from chiari headaches and life and such, so sometimes I don‚Äôt even notice if something hurts - uncomfortable is less desirable for me). 

It‚Äôs really hard to distinguish a norm for that stuff - there are 13 different types. I didn‚Äôt think I had it at first cuz my skin isn‚Äôt excessively stretchy. Then I realized that if you don‚Äôt have it - you can touch your thumb to your forearm. It can depend on the joint - some people have dancing collar bones and wandering ribs that are more painful - I can feel when a rib is out of place and that is more of a painful feeling.

Give the kids an intro to you as a coach - are you an open door policy type of person? Is the way you communicate/etc ever taken differently than how you meant it? In that case, explain before it happens.

For example - I call kids out for various things (good and bad) and they can only follow up with okay or a question. I tell them it‚Äôs not personal, it might not only be that person doing something good or bad, it‚Äôs always for the good of the group. I specifically say this because I was always really hard on myself and that could ruin my self-esteem for the day - especially if I got called out for messing one thing up one time and I never do it any other time. 

Also establish a teaching order for new kids. I start with posture and ballet positions.

If I think of more I‚Äôll add."

Like I get that the commenter has eds - but with no other listed symptoms, and OP is 15, and OP only had an issue after galavanting about all of Disneyland - I understand the need for awareness, but I don‚Äôt think this is the best way to achieve it"

Edit: this is not to say that I thought it was necessarily worth mentioning - it‚Äôs highly unlikely - OP is 15, in almost all cases, they would have had issues previously and with less physical activity being the cause (as their first instance) 

For example, I have eds, and I rent a wheelchair when I go to Disneyland. I was not diagnosed until 28, and my first dislocation I was a young kid. I bent down and my knee did a full on yeet."

I don‚Äôt know for sure, but I‚Äôm an artist, big gamer, did color guard for years, and trained/worked as a jeweler. The biggest issue was always just overuse injuries (tendinitis and I‚Äôd get a cortisone shot and be on my way). This was all based on symptoms, though, but I had a really good doc - he did my moms carpel tunnel surgery (both hands) and others (thumb joint fused, etc). 

My thumbs are bothering me now, and my right knee used to dislocate all the time (oddly enough, hasn‚Äôt in a while). But that‚Äôs about it. I still don‚Äôt know what type I have for sure either."

TooAfraidToAsk,fi8jjnu,t1_fi8exgw,1582241718.0,"I‚Äôm not insinuating anything. In the hood, the black kids are the majority (ergo, the range in wealth will go much higher than that of the 3 white kids in that school district). It‚Äôs just statistics. 

The SATs are literally proven to be designed very poorly for the success of kids from the hood - so you‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre actually being a little bit fair? 

Perhaps the white and/or Asian kids (not totally sure that‚Äôs accurate, but I could be wrong) are generally more successful because they make up more of the majority (ergo, the range in wealth will go much higher) their parents could afford healthcare, mental healthcare, food, tutors, opportunities, etc? 

If you think or pretend for one second that you don‚Äôt have a much better chance at being successful if you have/come from money - you‚Äôre wrong. Change mind (you won‚Äôt).

What about the American Indian kids? Yes, because we only exist here in America due to intentionally giving your ancestors small pox blankets and basically just committing mass genocide, you shall now receive this shit piece of land where you may live out your lifelong gauntlet to rise from the depths of poverty - should you choose to attempt it - also, everything else there is also literally made of shit. Great - go forth and live your American dream!"
