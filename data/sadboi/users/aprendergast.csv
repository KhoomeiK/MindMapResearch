Not just a list of ""fails"". Something that has dates/links to original Q drops and then current articles or even memes that are not abrasive and accessible to people who believe this stuff.

One of the reasons for this is I'm not trying to really reason with them the way I and most people would listen to reason. 

I was listening to someone recently talk about trying to convince anti-vaxxers and how statistics doesn't work with them because their ""beliefs"" are based on anecdotal experience. Anti-vaxxers will shut down or harden in their stance if you approach it from a statistical approach or try to explain herd mentality.

Telling them specific stories about kids losing all their limbs or the other things that are now happening to children when they don't get vaccinated is a more persuasive tactic to someone with their mentality.

Your point about the Christchurch shooter is a very good one in that respect, but I was hoping there would be more fundamental things that Anonymous did to discredit QAnon as a whole. 

Pointing to 4chan and other sites where the actual ""information"" stems from is ineffective, because my family honestly barely knows much about QAnon and how the information is disseminated. Trying to educate them on this, will not convince them because they already believe the theories.

Given that it's such an enigmatic thing, I unfortunately think it needs to be addressed on a case by case basis, and like you said I shouldn't get my hopes high, but I thought I'd ask at the outset in case I could save a lot of time looking into all this crap.

I will be cataloguing what works for me and my family members, but given each person believes different theories, I get why something like this would be helpful to some, but not others.

You're just putting yourself in the architect's shoes or is there a play on words or connotation I'm missing?

Either way, try to make the Stevie Wonder line as strong as possible so that you could actually end on that. Then the rest of it can work like a tag.

I like the premise, but here are some other ideas to play with and maybe something might be helpful:

What about some kind of traumatizing reason/story why the architect would put the sink somewhere else?

Like maybe he/she came from a family whose bowel movements were so bad, they had to get in and out before they passed out from the smell?

Maybe he just wanted to wash his hands one time right after his dad got done in the bathroom and his brother locked him in on purpose for an hour. The architect vowed to never let that happen to any other child ever again.

Maybe it was so bad his family tied ropes to their ankles because it was like entering the temple from the Old Testament where you didn't know if you're gonna make it out alive or not. 

You could mime the trauma from the architect constantly dragging out his dad after late nights of drinking and chili/curry when all he wanted to do was wash his hands.

Or, maybe the sink gets used more often than the toilet because they were germ-a-phobes?

Also, my wife is an architect and I always tease her about not using ""form follows function"" design, meaning that often she would rather have something look good than it be useful (it's not completely true about her, but it bugs her so I tease her). 

That might be too niche too use, but play around with the idea of replacing the Steve Wonder line with something that is pompous sounding. 

Where it sounds like you actually know what you were talking about, but it's done in an arrogant way as if everyone else has been there before and knows what you're talking about.

I'm a tad jealous your immediate family sounds reasonable to talk to, lol.

I do have conservative friends that I can hold rational and productive conversations with. They voted for Trump based on his agenda though. Cutting taxes/spending, small government, etc. They don't believe the conspiracy theories he peddles or often even like the guy. We find common ground on those points often.

Same with my Christian friends who voted for him just based on his abortion stance. Many recognize that he's not really a religious man, and don't believe he was sent by God. But even for those who don't, I can still understand where they're coming from and engage with them civilly.

I simply can't with the extremists, which is what my mother/sister are now. They were not this way just a couple years ago and the speed at which that changed alarms me. There is no high road with these types of people.

The people who think COVID-19 is a Democrat hoax/conspiracy. That Obama was born in Kenya and still today in 2020 believe that Obama is The Anti-Christ (not making that one up). That Michelle Obama is a man or transgender and should be made fun of for it. That Bill Gates is killing children with vaccines on purpose in other countries to depopulate the planet. That Democratic and Republican moderates like Hillary Clinton, Obama, George W, James Comey, etc. regularly kill children so that they can use their Adrenochrome as a drug.

Those are the people that, believe it or not, I'm starting to see more of. I think it's still a small vocal minority, but when you look at Trump's rallies, you will see a lot of people waving around ""Q"" signs/shirts/etc. 

Those are the people that my mother and sister have turned into in just the past couple years and I'm worried what happens if we don't curb that trend."

I honestly and truly don't mean that in an argumentative way, it's just that there is a radicalization that has been occurring in the US the last couple years, despite many of us really trying to take the high road since Obama was in office. 

I cited Michelle's high/low quote in a comment to someone else here, and I completely agree with it, but the only way I've been able to go high with my family has been to not discuss certain topics with them, which is why I feel helpless when I see what happens to them.

You simply can't have a civil narrative with them about anything remotely political, and when they're left to their own devices they just become more radical. They do not follow by the positive example you put forth. I would give you a great example on this, but it would take forever to read (sorry most of my comments already do, lol).

There have always been conspiracy theories, but to see the stats now and that my own mother and sister, who were previously goodhearted and positive people a couple years ago, have succumbed to this negativity and insanity is truly alarming.

The problem is these people lack empathy already, and will double down like they've been doing for the last decade or more.

NFL players taking a knee is as tranquil a form a protest that you can ever have, but if people with that skin tone where protesting like this with ARs, people would actually be getting killed not hit with hoses. That double standard does exist.

I don't see a way to break free of this other than to wait for demographics to change over time and make sure we turn out the votes.

I hate to equate it to mental health issues, but the psychosis I went through at one point of my life was more rational than the paranoid ideas QAnon puts forth. I'm not being hyperbolic. There is something very wrong with what's happening to people here and their mental states.

Sounds like you just heard the noise of the rain bouncing off the wall, which can be confusing to anyone, so I wouldn't worry.

You're searching fname with username. Is that right? Is fname just the first name or are usernames stored there?

Another issue I see is that I think you need a loop inside the $stmt_result->num_rows > 0 statement. That wouldn't cause the error you're getting right now, but I think fetch_assoc() returns an array of associative arrays. I could be wrong, but keep that in mind once you get past this error.

What happens when you just output $stmt_result->fetch_assoc() without checking for num_rows? Just use print_r() to see what the data/array looks like. If it's empty there's an issue with the query or database records.

Also, it's not a major thing, but with die statements, you don't really need to use an else statement. 

You could just wrap the Connection Error in an if statement and put the rest of your code below it without the else. If the connection fails, there rest of your code won't run."

I struggle with depression too, so I know what that part is like and it really sucks. Please hang in there. Glad to hear you're trying to learn things and keep yourself busy. After medication and therapy, that's the best approach I've found. Keep at it.

YouTube CAN be a really good resource if you know what you are trying to learn. If you break up tasks into pieces, that and StackOverflow will get you really far. Remember web devs aren't smarter than anyone else, they just know how to google better.

That Udemy course you posted looks decent, but I'm kinda torn with recommending it. It might be good if you want to focus on basics. The CSS and JS portion seem like they might be pretty simple, so if you're wanting to learn frontend a little more, there might be better courses for that. I'm guessing that course might cover a good portion of what you already know if you can handle the PHP side with a database. Don't get me wrong, it wouldn't be bad to go through it to cover the basics and make sure you have a good foundation, but if your intention is to focus on the frontend side, I would explore other courses. 

[This course looks pretty decent](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-bootstrap-php-certification-for-beginners). It looks like it's more info driven and not based around building a CRUD app, so I guess it depends on how you want to approach it, but I think you want a course that will help you with either learning Bootstrap or just getting better with CSS.

Think about what you want to learn longer term though. I'm assuming you want to turn this into a career ideally? Take a look at jobs in your area. See what PHP frameworks and CMSs companies are looking for right now. I know a lot of places are on hiatus, but it might give you some idea of what you need to learn to be competitive and point you to the direction your want to head in. Look at the kinds of JavaScript that companies want you to know too.

I'm a mostly backend engineer, but my jobs have all required some level of interaction with the frontend. People here saying that this is all handled by designers aren't exactly right. At some companies, you can have frontend engineers that will do a lot of that work, but it's been my experience with most mid-size companies that I end up doing at least some frontend work. That's why you have a lot of companies looking for full stack developers instead of just backend or just frontend.

I am unemployed at the moment too. I've been working with Laravel for the last few years and WordPress before that. I'm trying to learn ReactJs or VueJs. My JS experience is limited to jQuery for the most part, and a lot of employers in my area are looking for people with more modern JavaScript experience: Angular, React, Vue, Node, etc.

All that being said, and I know I'm kinda telling you two different things here, but I personally think it's good to jump into frameworks and CMSs to play with them and see how they work. Learning PDO is good foundational learning for starting out, but in real world applications, you probably won't use it. You'll usually end up using some type of query builder, but that's just been my experience. 

If you're still starting out and don't feel confident, focus on building a solid foundation in PHP, CSS, and vanilla JS, but just keep in mind what you want to work with in the future and what your end goals are.

South Korea had their first case same day as ours and they were able to ramp up testing MUCH more quickly and at a larger scale than we did initially. It went unchecked in the US for way longer than it should have.
