The rangers (these guys were park rangers, not qualified police academy graduates) decided to set up a sting operation and catch people early in the morning - before the restrooms were open - peeing in the park for their new (Caught a Sex Offender) merit badge. They decided to set up at the archery points. These were secluded areas so people could zero in their bows without fear of people being around. 

On day two, they caught someone. During the arrest, the ranger bragged to the guy how peeing in a park is now a sex crime, and he is going to jail for 20+ years. Archery Andy beats Ranger Rick’s ass and runs off, gets in his truck, and bails. Ranger Rick, being a genius, has no way of identifying Archery Andy. It was pre-dusk, never got an ID, and didn’t write down vehicle information. 

The state park came out with a directive about wilderness bathroom usage, and essentially told the rangers to mind their own business."
