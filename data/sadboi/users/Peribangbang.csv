When I was starting out it was mainly focusing on keeping calm and not letting my nerves get the best of me and making sure my stance and movement was in check. 

I would get hit a lot in my early fights without attacking too much just because I was focused on myself instead. In my opinion it's best to work on the way you react and your ability to keep level headed before you worry about being offensive.

That's only for sparring and regulated fights though. Defending yourself is a completely different story."
