helpme,fqoii90,t3_gk1730,1589516009.0,"Breath. You can get back up from this mistake. It's okay.

First, try to reason with them, don't give out immediately. Try to explain, and make sure they understand where you're coming from, and that you understand why and how you made a mistake. Acknowledging your mistake goes a long way, wether it seems like it or not. 

Secondly, if they can't see your side, I'm not too sure, but you might have to move on. Now, I don't know you're relationship with your friends, as I know that stuff is different for everyone, but maybe you might work better with a new group? I'm not too sure, as again, it's a different situation for everyone.

Thirdly, don't get yourself too beat up about it. It was an honest mistake, and a miscommunication. Those happen all the time, and sometimes there's nothing you can do about it unfortunately. Things have been looking good for you, and if you just try your hardest,  like I mean really try to keep positive, I think you can get back on your feet. Take it day by day, hour by hour, one task at a time. I've been trying to do the same thing, and it's tiring some days, but it goes a long way just smiling, regardless of how you feel. 

Or, my advice just sucks, because it might not be for you. For me, smiling helps, and I know it sounds stupid. But, for you, something else might help. Either way, I hope you're able to resurface better than before, because it is possible. Good luck.

Also, if you need/want, you can DM me, as I'm always willing to help if I can!"

First off, math is important because it helps your brain function better, as well as help you when you need it. Of course, math 20 & 30 are more specific but my point still stands. As for history, it's needed because we can't let some of that stuff repeat, and believe me, there's enough people who wanna repeat it who *have* been through history. Literature is also useful for reading and writing skills. Anyways, I'll stop preaching


I'd suggest you spend some more time on school, as it is important. I'm experiencing the effects of that as the end of my school year is coming to an end. Making music is super cool and I hope you can release a song with a label, but school is (mostly) a priority, as if music doesn't work out or if things change, you won't be able to get a career as easily, and it also helps your resume no matter what you're doing if you have an education. 

Now, I do disagree with your teacher, saying that you don't care about your future, but education is a major part of anyone's future. Again, I suggest you spend a little more time on school, it'll go a long ways and it will help prevent this from happening in the future. Maybe you could schedule time to work on music and homework? Maybe you could write down what you *need* to do for the week and/or day, and what you *want* to do, and sort them out, and organize your time so you can get homework done while still having time to work on music."
