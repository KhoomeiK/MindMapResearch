She could develop an autoimmune disease, according to her doctor, but she just needs to make some lifestyle changes including having less stress and eating better (I’m gonna start helping out around the house n make some v healthy food for everybody to eat; green smoothies and such) and then she probably won’t. Still, ty soso much for the kind and helpful advice!! & just btw,
there is a pretty definite correlation—according to many studies—between stress and developing pretty much any condition because it makes your body’s system go into overdrive. I don’t want to seem snarky or anything tho!!! I’m just letting you know bcoz it’s good to know :) Anyways, I appreciate the advice and kind words💖"
