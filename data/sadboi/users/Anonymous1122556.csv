Every time we'd end up arguing and her blocking me on everything and not speaking ""anymore"", she'd upload a new picture on Facebook with lots of people complimenting her and stuff. I always wondered why she did this. She also does it at the start and end of every relationship. She's been in 2 since splitting with me 5 months ago and her previous ex dumped her within 2 months, lmao."
