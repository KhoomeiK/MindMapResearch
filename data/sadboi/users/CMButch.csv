l4d2,fpd63uf,t1_fpd4te1,1588520614.0,"What comedic values they( PewDiePie, Markiplier) hold off for people to find then entertaining? Penis jokes,edgy jokes? Screaming? Cringy pun jokes? Even that is mediocre because anyone can do that. I literally can do anything they do when it comes to comedic reactions and values on top of mediocre gameplay. Not to mention they hide or enhance that comedic reactions with editing which furthemore impugns their talent as being talentless. I mean real comedy geniuses are Jim Carrey, Rowan Atkinson; not those Youtube clowns.

Small amount of people can pull off those comedy things Jim, Rowan,Robin(RIP) can pull off, while anyone can scream at mic, say shitty penis jokes, scream rape etc and hide anything in editing.

I know this is off topic, but I did read some comments here that comment aka first point( content is mediocre if anyone can do it) did kinda intrigued me, so I kind agreed/elaborated on that point. I just added money to and unjustice surrounding those mediocre contents. Since it should be factual that amazing content = more money, mediocre content= less money but it's vice versa: PewDiePie has more money than ERB.

What you wrote about this topical guy; he seems to have pretty mediocre content since he does all that and even worse than Markiplier's/Pewdiepie's since they add some comedic content despite being shit/ for kids, while he does not. And he cheats and lies which is salt on the wound.

Only L4D youtubers I know are Kilplix, Criken and WowSuchGaming which are by default mediocre(since anyone can do it) and their comedic values are bad since they hide behind editing and trolling their friends.

Youtube should've returned to phases where no money is involved.IMO"
l4d2,fpd2sl4,t1_fpd26n7,1588518628.0,"But if we look at content of video no matter the editing and recording, shouldn't content on Youtube be mediocre as a fact when it comes to many many Youtubers?

Pewdiepie: plays Minecraft, reacts to stuff ( no matter editing) =mediocre. Since everyone can do that.

Markiplier: plays video games = anyone can do that = mediocre

I mean I do agree that most Youtubers are mediocre and trash even PewDiePie if we go by this but it's kinda depressing that they're millionaires for doing that thing while many Youtubers, actors etc which content small amount of people can do are weaker than them

ERB is one of those: Small amount of people can do it and yet they get way less money than PewDiePie while anyone can do PDP's job. This is same with shitty players: anyone can pull off Ronaldo's or any player's stuff and yet they're millionaire's. 

When it comes to actors on other hand, not many people can act while everyone can sing: see all these lil rappers and Youtube rappers and so many singers nowdays. This is why world is shit, many people are millionaires but their talent is mediocre, it's just luck, but there are millionaires who have talent: many actors, ERB etc etc."

Fallout,fnm9d3t,t1_fnlxsnc,1587067360.0,"Those are minority/trolling. Or they think Fallout 3 is their first Fallout game. Honestly, I don't see anyone who thinks that something that has number 3,4,5,6 1000 is first game in that franchise.. 

It's objectively better for this genre because it would give you experience of you actually being there and using quick-wits to survive in that environment which is post apocalypse. This is same with horror games. Horror games are objectively better in RT and FPS because it would give you full immersion of the game, like you're there, you getting scared. While TB, or isometric or even TP horror games don't give you that.

Same with Fallout. RT and being there in that world would give you better experience, it's ""real"" it's not fantasy and it works. You leave the Vault and it feels like you were trapped after bombs fell and not Chosen One example, because you're controlling that guy and that's not ""you"". NV proved that FPS-RPG Fallout can exist and it's the best. It's not our fault that Bethesda can't create good RPG game. 

Don't forget that NV had only a year and half(?) development. Imagine if NV had 4 years like Fallout 4. I am sorry all this goes to one solution: FPS-RPG work for Fallout much better than isometric/TB system since logically: if FNV had 4 years instead of year+, that game would break records. Look at Outer Worlds, it's FPS/RPG and it destroys TB/isometric games.

 Example Pokemon games like previously mentioned: it makes no sense that it is FP, despite it's you and it doesn't make sense it's RT because you battle with Pokemon. It makes sense that Pokemon it is how it is. Fallout obviously didn't click with audience to be TB/isometric game( if it did it would've been like LoL: isometric and just TB and it didn't: this is rebuttal to your comment to that era because Isometric games still exist like LoL and Pillars of Eternity) but as I said LoL and PoE work for that system; Fallout does not, if it did again: they would've stuck with that and not change it no matter if it's Bethesda or not) I would give my right arm if Bethesda never bought Fallout, Obsidian or Interplay/Black Isle( hopefully I am not butchering their names: too lazy to search it) would **MAKE FALLOUT FPS/RPG and ditch turn based and isometric system.**

I think it would be Van Buren and after that they would be like let's make NV: spin off ( how it is now aka FPS/RPG) and boom NV would explode and would be like: Ok let's continue making FPS/RPG Fallout."
Fallout,fnkmah7,t1_fnkbv10,1587032515.0,"> Don't get me started on people who think real-time is objectionably better. 

TB and RT are not objectively better than each other generally. But due the game's genre or environment yes we can say which one is objectively better.

Example; Pokemon. Pokemon works as TB game, as we can see that they didn't change that since day 1. They have made a couple RT games like Pokepark but it didn't STICK. You can clearly see with numbers of games and bags of money they counted for that.

As for Fallout: RT is objectively better than TB, also visible from bags of money and numbers.

Now, let's be real before anyone( not just you) say: Ooooh, people started coming at Fallout 3, they think FO3 is the first""

Are those people dumb? No, they're not. They clearly see Fallout 3 is Fallout **3** or Fallout **4.**

Why would they think Fallout 3 is first? Obviously all people that played 3 and 4 or majority googles or looked upon Fallout 1 and 2 and guess what? They didn't play it. They hate isometric, boring, TB system. It's logical. They see date and how it works and they dislike it, it was good in that time, but now it's not. 

Or if you say "" Ooooh, FO3 is garbage and many people liked FO1 and FO2 better""

That's minority like NMA level of minority that hate anything beyond FO2 and love TB combat. Still numbers don't lie: FO3 and beyond all did better than FO1 and 2 in moneymaking and majority vote because they are real time games. I am not saying that if FO1 and 2 got remade, they would bomb. They would do bonkers, just TB and isometric system fucks them up.

Or "" Ooooh FO3, NV, FO4 are played by kids, FO1 and FO2 audience is way mature: mature audience's saying >> kid's"". 

1. Audience for RT Fallout games are not kids , there are kids in every game, but that's incorrect.
2. As of second yes, but there could be instance of kid's opinion > adult's depends on handicap. But again Many True Nerd is an adult and he said that FO3 and NV are his best Fallouts and he played 1 and 2. That proves it.

&#x200B;

So to sum it up: Fallout as post-apocalyptic game, TB doesn't work if it did; Fallout would still be TB game and Bethesda wouldn't make it RT. It just doesn't work. If Fallout was fantasy game: it could work but RT would still be pleasing(like Zelda or FF). If Fallout was like monster hunting game like Pokemon, TB would work the hell out."

Back in 2009 and 2010 when theaters weren't that good in China, it got like 200 mil. I think Avatar 1 will get at least 200 mil more in China now. We will see( it depends on this situation if it's 100% clean and if everyone will watch it( because of fear or Corona)."

As for their evidence, the first opinion that says it is fard to grow a beard and it is haram to shave it belong to the majority of the scholars.**

I am going by scholars who say it's makrooh and mustahab and not fard. Which makes sense. Beard is just a look. Look won't get you anywhere except to some females who like beards.If I don't wanna have a beard per say and i shave it and girls don't want me because of that, that's not my problem.It won't affect your prayer, your fast, your zakat if you have/don't have beard. If you have beard that doesn't mean you're automatically immune to anything like murder, theft etc.

Beard is just that personal choice of looks. It looks good on me( but I shave it because of itching and studying), on some people like Asians it doesn't look good. Why would Asian guy who is Muslim per say have a beard if it doesn't look good on him? He wouldn't, he would shave."

I don't mean personal preference but more of problems that come within that( Idk how to say) example, my beard starts to itch and I shave it so, I follow some scholars that say it's not fard. Later, if my beard stops itching( maybe because my skin is dry) I will keep the beard because it looks good on me and that beard will be like idk how to say it like small.

Like masturbation( The [Sunni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni) schools of jurisprudence (known as [*madhaahib*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhhab) \- the *Hanafi*, *Shafi'i*, *Maliki*, *Hanbali, and Zahiri* schools of *Fiqh*) have differing stances on the issue. Some see it forbidden in certain cases (i.e. if it leads a man/woman to ignore their spouse sexually) but recommended it when they see it as a lesser evil to illicit sex. It is generally prohibited according to the *Hanafi* and *Hanbali* [*madhaahib*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhhab), unless one fears adultery or fornication, or is under the desire pressure, in which case, it is permissible to seek a relief through masturbation. It is prohibited all the time according to the *Maliki* and [*Shafi*\`i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shafi%60i) [*madhaahib*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhhab).[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_masturbation#cite_note-auto3-4) Zahiri Imam [Ibn Hazm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Hazm) regards masturbation as permissible.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_masturbation#cite_note-auto4-5) Scholars have also stated that masturbation would not be necessary if one realizes the flexible approach Islam takes to [marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_Islam). For example, according to Sheikh Shomeh Yerkity, 'against the clear teachings of Islam, marriage has been rendered another difficult process today due to warped customs and conventions and undue expectations. When we approach marriage from the point of view of pristine Islam, we shall find less and fewer people being forced to exercise the above type of exceptional rulings'.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_masturbation#cite_note-askthescholar.com-6) Yet if one's desire is so overwhelming one might perform masturbation but in that case it will be like eating the flesh of a pig to survive from major hunger or starvation when no other food is available.[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_masturbation#cite_note-askthescholar.com-6) )

 . So we follow something we like that makes sense in our lives.

I think in Noble Qur'an it's stated how to pray, fast but it's written little ""metaphorically"". I mean Muhammad PBUH followed Qur'an, right? How did he fast then? Obviously from Qur'an.

**Scholars have different opinions about growing, shortening and shaving the beard.** **According to some scholars, it is fard to grow a beard and it is haram to shave it; according to some, it is sunnah to grow a beard and it is makrooh (abominable) to shave it; others say it is mustahab (preferred) to grow. As for their evidence, the first opinion that says it is fard to grow a beard and it is haram to shave it belong to the majority of the scholars.**

So if it's not done(sex) then it's not haram. So at best kissing and hugging is haram on pending aka if you do it( Zina,Zina and kissing and hugging is haram because it lead you to that) if you don't do Zina and get married; kissing and hugging cancels being haram."

I also don't understand why is that kiss and hug acceptable when people marry but not before. Same shit would happen before and after.

So example I don't marry a girl and I kiss her: and example haram is because idk something.

Here about masturbation and STFU.

>How you confusing reducing eyes - with opened penis? If I command you “reduce your eyes”, you understand it “muffle your penis”?

Reducing vision and guard your private area: Private area: penis or vagina. So you reduce your vision because you don't whip out your penis or vagina to do Zina. Again, you talk with people normally and girls too. Have you ever even talked with girls? Obviously not. You don't talk with females( and vice versa) with penis/vagina. It's with words.

> Kissing, hugging - a woman you’re not married to, are different types of zeena

Zina is sex before marriage. How is kissing and hugging a girlfriend sex? That makes zero sense. Also, it's girlfriend you're planning to marry, your potential wife. Many people in order to marry it would need 3-4 years, some even 7 years. What you think all those years people can't express love by hugging, kissing etc heartfelt talking? You can. Of course you won't after you meed a girl go to kiss, hug. You would do that after several months. You need to know her, her interest etc.

It's not my desires, I am just saying how world works nowdays with gf/bf. It's inevitable to have gf/bf in order to have a wife and gf/bf is just one step. Not to mention what if there is a contract in having BF/GF. What if third person comes and we sign contract to be GF/BF, like not married but like married. That means we can't do stuff? Marriage is legal contract of wills between man and woman. What if some third person like her sister, aunt and two witnesses come to my/her house and we swear that we will live together and be happy and we do? So not marriage but like marriage?"
islam,fkk2m0r,t1_fkjnx90,1584270924.0,"How is masturbation haram where it clearly says Except wife and right hand possess they wont be blamed. Right hand = masturbation. Go to wikipedia and read masturbation in Islam and you will see different opinions and yet you are saying it is haram as a fact because you are delusional.From that ayet it clearly says only can only masturbate and let your wife touch the dick,anything beyond is trangression. Like learn to understand. Stop being limited or stop saying something is haram while not even understanding it.

I’m bringing you here proof that looking to namahram unclothed woman (and even to clothed either in most of situations) is haram:

(24:30) Tell the believing men to reduce [some] of their vision and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do.

To reduce some of their vision and guard their private parts. Yeah, because if you whip out your penis in front of conversation is unpure.Not  to mention no one will talk and have fun like playing games, laughing, naked. Normal conversation and talking is normal with clothes in coffee shops etc.. Same with kissing and hugging with your girlfriend as a goodbye and kiss to express love to your future potential wife."
islam,fkii5jg,t1_fkigy6z,1584220564.0,"In the end the best way is to follow Noble Qur'an and to be Qur'anist and to stick with your own beliefs and not what many people on the Reddit say and not to believe them and even some scholars. Qur'an is a word from Allah SWT and that's why IMO all Muslims should believe that and not some things that some people say especially how some hadiths can be fabricated( that's why I am ignoring this sub for awhile when it comes to this because I know if I write something that makes no sense to me like dating in order to find wife(like I say dating is OK that's how it goes it's inevitable, they go: OOOH IT'S NOT YOU MUSTN'T DATE, IT'S HARAM etc"", I would get bombarded with dislikes and people(extremists probably) saying things and ""shitting"" on me..

One more thing since you mention young person( thanks I am relatively young in my early 20s), some people are saying: think of death,death this, death there, like Ramadan is coming but don't worry you can die before that...

I was like dudes, why so dark? If I am in 60s I would understand that but it's morbid to say that you can anyday( I mean I understand you can die anyday) but you don't have to say that morbid stuff/dark stuff especially after I don't have wife/gf, don't have kids, grandkids, didn't finish college etc etc etc.

Honestly I kinda think this sub is really toxic.. I understand everyone practices Islam differently, but they don't have to be toxic and say things that are haram to say that they haram as facts when it's not proven. It's their opinion.

Like for me dating in order to find girl and kissing a girl with her love is OK, and I don't go around people and say and downvote anyone who says dating is haram,,,

Sorry if this is little bit of rant about sub(not Islam though because Islam has nothing to do with this sub aka some people on this sub), but I had to do it and you seem as cool person who would agree and understand why this sub is pretty toxic( BTW some people were saying that this sub was actually good before, lol). I love Allah SWT I will continue believing in Him and love Islam( and I agree with everything in Qur'an like those 70 harams, now I didn't read entire Qur'an but I will do but Qur'an is not fabricated) but I do disagree with some Islamic things that people practice(dating without sex, masturbating,listening to good music like breaking benjamin) and some hadiths that could be fabricated."

I am pirating games and movies. I do fast( I am planning to fast entire month), I read some ayets from Qur'an but I do plan to read entire Qur'an and I agree with many things in Islam, but I also disagree.(BTW I do plan to start praying later Insh'Allah) and I will stop pirating games/movies I am doing that because I am still a student. Once I get a job I will stop.

I read extended version of harams and Zina is one of them aka sex before marriage. But I never saw that in those 70 harams that dating, kissing , hugging a girl,masturbation is haram.I think those harams come from hadiths. Now from hadiths I do agree with a lot of things but I disagree with some, maybe even those things are fabricated like masturbation many scholars are against it and some are ok with it, who to trust? That's why I am going for masturbation is good if you're single.

So, I don't know why many people here are against dating in order to find a wife. I understand that dating for fun is haram, but if I date in order for that girl to be my wife and I kiss her and express love to her, idu why is that haram. Honestly, I started thinking that those people are extremists...

I do understand that all would lead to Zina; kissing and hugging, but what if doesn't? What if it's just a kiss and that's it..

As of sex before marriage I understand it but come to think of it marriage is just a paper.IDU, why is sex forbidden before marriage? I mean if we go by that if I don't marry a girl but we live together and forever liek happily ever after and we like ""marry"" between ourselves and like we swear that we will live together and happy forever, it's haram to have sex?  I don't understand that process.( idk if you're Muslim or not, if you are can you explain if you know?). IDK, probably I won't have sex before marriage but idk why is marriage a must and how to marry in Islam? Do I have to do Shariah marriage? Or Normal marriage ( like go to municipality or in hotel and you get married or something). I bet people here would say that Muslims that don't marry according to shariah law is not valid. LMAO.

I found this on wiki:  In [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam), [marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage) ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language): نِكَاح‎, [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic): *Nikāḥ*) is a legal [contract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_marriage_contract) between a man and a woman. Both the groom and the bride are to consent to the marriage of their own free wills.

So, free will, what if it's free will for us not to marry like in a way people marry but marry like verbally or alone? Shouldn't that count.

EDIT: that normal marriage is called civil marriage xD.

EDIT2: I found something about civil marriage (

Although it is not encouraged for the believers to have a civil marriage in preference to an Islamic Nikaah; if one has had a civil marriage and the following conditions of marriage have been met, the marriage will be deemed legal and valid in the sight of Shariah:

The amount of mehr is determined.

Proposal by the man, and acceptance by the girl.

Two witnesses to the marriage contract.

So, civil marriage is ok/halal."
