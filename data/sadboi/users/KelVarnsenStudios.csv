Just start simple and memorize the open strings, then some of the frets. Then the rests of the frets. Reading music while you memorize could help.

 It's not the same as working with a metronome, because a drummer or a backing track usually provide some sort of evenly distributed subdivision for you to play over. That is why it can be harder, but more instructive, to play along with a metronome: you must make the subdivision for yourself. This strengthens your internal clock.

The slower you put the metronome on, the harder it gets to subdivide. 

Try different tempos. You might find out you do much better in certain tempos. Maybe you find it impossible to play at certain tempos. Who knows what you might find out."

> Does it matter whether I practice chords or intervals?

Yes, I would argue that you do intervals first since they are less ambiguous than chords."
LearnGuitar,fos9syf,t3_g99cjn,1588026574.0,"Do you sing intervals and can you play them on a single string, adjacent strings and skipped strings were applicable? 30 minutes of total ear training per day sounds pretty decent."
Guitar,fol3gvv,t1_fol2zij,1587854137.0,The formula as I know it is 1b2b33b556b7. Half steps and whole steps all the way till you hit the root. The b5 can also be thought of as the #11 if that fits you better. It's an eight note scale so it's hella complicated.
Guitar,fnde74l,t1_fndd6zf,1586867767.0,"Intervals are the distance between two notes. Zero is the first distance. That would be called the ""unison"" interval. When you tune your guitar and fret the A on the lowest string, then play the open A string, then the distance between the notes are zero, producing a unison interval. Already when you're only tuning your guitar, you are practicing intervals. It can be, but it doesn't have to be more complicated than that.

&#x200B;

Next would be the minor second, a half-step, or one fret. Play the fifth fret, then the sixth fret, then that is a minor second. Play the fifth fret and then the fourth step, then that is down a minor second. 

&#x200B;

There are 12 different intervals possible within the octave. 12 half-steps= 12 frets. Play an open string, then fret the 12th fret to produce what's called an octave.

&#x200B;

Intervals combine to produce to produce triads, 7th chords and scales. Rembember: if you know all your intervals, you know all your intervals!

&#x200B;

The quicker you learn about intervals, the better. Getting a good music theory book could help. Singing intervals helps. Ear training can help. Anything can work, if you work on it. Make it a habit, do it daily, otherwise it won't work."
