Asexual,fq4nur7,t1_fpyoxpd,1589080141.0,"Hey! Thanks for taking the time to write that comment.

I have given much consideration into whether I should opt for a physical solution or a mental one. I fear that if I went for the physical solution, or the ""quick fix"", I'd feel guilty for taking the east way out. Still, after much consideration (I have been wondering this for months, believe it or not), I had decided as a physical cure. And it has much more to do with things other than the fear of solving it mentally, although that fear is very prominent. (Beacuse solving my situation mentally will most definitely involve exposure therapy, and right now I'm not in the right state of mind to do such a terrifying thing.)"
Asexual,fpy9acj,t1_fpy88rb,1588998908.0,"Good to know there's at least some hope there. Some is always better than none. If there is a psychiatric evaluation, I would hope I get approved, seeing as having frequent wet dreams and sexual thoughts has--and I'm not overexaggerating--made me want to commit suicide. It's because I have such a bad history with sexual related things that I just can't stand anything related to it. I also ended up in a stress center at one point.

I really, really hope there's an answer out there, whether it's very extensive, professional mental help or a physical solution."

modernwarfare,foilmqc,t3_g7aajn,1587789808.0,I feel way too called out
Asexual,fne90p5,t1_fnc5icg,1586885171.0,Are wet dreams more intense if you haven't ejaculated in a while?
Asexual,fnc55aw,t1_fnc4u6r,1586828833.0,"I've been riding it out for a while. It sure is a tough ride. Going to bed every night in fear.

And I don't mean to sound like a prick, but how do I know what you're saying is true information as compared to the rest of the internet?"
Asexual,fnc4buo,t1_fnc3wkg,1586828336.0,But why do I see everywhere wet dreams are caused by buildup?

modernwarfare,fmi3nnh,t3_fv91hi,1586101744.0,Update: This game is almost impossible to play now.
modernwarfare,fmhasdo,t3_fv4cqg,1586072700.0,Do you have crossplay on or off? If it's on you could encounter some PC hackers. That's why I usually keep it off.
modernwarfare,fmh7d6g,t1_fmh5arq,1586069198.0,"Well, glad to know I'm not the only one. Hopefully it gets fixed soon because I want to take advantage of 2XP weekend."
sexualhealth,flm7x07,t1_flje70v,1585276701.0,They're not synonyms as far as I know. Semen carries the sperm during ejaculation.

Asexual,fkp5w8a,t1_fkgrj33,1584402505.0,"That's why I was confused. I technically usually don't feel sexual attraction because I'm afraid of it. But what I've realized is I may be something called ""lithsexual"". Because I can feel sexually attracted to someone, but since I have a fear of ejaculation (and therefore sex), I would never act on it."

asexuality,fg1g63n,t1_fg1fo6p,1580426508.0,"Electroejaculation is when you're under anesthetics and they send electricity into your body, which automatically contacts your muscles and makes you ejaculate. And you don't feel a thing."
asexuality,fg1fav2,t1_fg1ewiu,1580426072.0,"I shouldn't have been so broad. I don't like the feeling of ejaculation, which is why I'm trying to prevent involuntary instances during sleep. I wouldn't even consider doing it while I'm awake. No siree, not for me. Is there a way to get semen out without the feeling of orgasm? Obviously it would have to be in some medical procedure though, such as prostate massage or electroejaculation."
asexuality,fg1dzmu,t1_ffzq2m7,1580425412.0,"Hmm. Is it possible to get monthly semen extractions then? Silly question, I know. (Also if you hadn't figured it out, my goal here is to prevent buildup-caused wet dreams because I hate not deciding when I ejaculate, and I can prevent any other form of wet dream because I rarely ever think of women sexually)"
AskParents,ffarydb,t1_ffarr8u,1579743093.0,"Okay, thanks. I'll probably bring it up to my therapist then. Also I thought I'd clarify he, from what I see, treats my mom fine. And my siblings decently well. It only seems to be me he has a problem with. And I don't know why."
AskParents,ffardo0,t1_ffaqzz2,1579742713.0,"I have my mom who treats me a lot better than my step dad. The problem is, she always defends him even if he did something that was obviously wrong, as if she's afraid to say anything bad about him.

I also luckily have a therapist. I should probably go to him?"
Asexual,ffagdbk,t1_ff2i99z,1579735115.0,"Not necessarily celibate. I'm fine with marriage, just not sex. 

And that's kind of my worry, misrepresenting the community. I don't want people to think all asexuals are like me, afraid of sex.

Perhaps if someone asks, I could just explain that not all asexuals are afraid of sex, but I am."
relationship_advice,fed7x51,t1_fed7rqv,1579002979.0,"Agreed. You shouldn't say you love a girl that soon. But we live and we learn, right?"
Asexual,fe5angu,t3_enhbpr,1578867089.0,"Nope! I'm asexual and sex-repulsed and I can't wait to have kids! (Of course, since I'm sex-repulsed, I'll probably go through semen extraction to impregnate the woman)."

Asexual,fe55ni4,t3_enlq6z,1578865857.0,It can be hard trying to find someone who accepts your sexuality. But try to find some comfort in knowing that any guy who reacts to your asexuality like that isn't a guy you deserve or should be with in the first place.

Asexual,fdq4k59,t1_fdpjlu4,1578654530.0,I've never been a fan of the idea of dating apps. It feels too forced. But I do find a little comfort in knowing I can always resort to it.
Asexual,fdoz36p,t1_fdor2g0,1578616162.0,"Yeah, I hope he updates us. In fact, I'm going to follow him."
Asexual,fdoxtum,t3_emcemj,1578615344.0,"Congratulations! It's literally the best thing ever when you have feelings for someone and they're okay with your sexuality. Good luck on the date!

By the way, do you mind giving me a few pointers on how to get a date when you're asexual? Like, how to find a girl who accepts you? Did you just follow the advice given to you in your previous post?"
Asexual,fd0oezy,t1_fcwsg16,1578121603.0,"What are the names of the surgeries, if you know them? Also, I thought about just not masturbating, but if I don't do it for a little while, the tension builds up and my body has a nocturnal emission. There's really no avoiding orgasms for me, which is why I was wondering if there are ways to get rid of the ability to do so."
Asexual,fcsi2pf,t3_ei3mno,1577916918.0,"I always have that fear as well. I do, however, find a little comfort in knowing that if worst comes to worst, there are asexual dating sites. I hope I don't have to use one though. I'm not a big fan of dating sites."
