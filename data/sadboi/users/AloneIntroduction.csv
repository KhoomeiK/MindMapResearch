haircoloring,f1piomm,t1_f1p9932,1569681551.0,Haha maybe I should‚Äôve just put split down the middle instead of split hair lol my bad made sense in my head üòÖ.  But yes I do plan on going to a professional I don‚Äôt color it myself because I‚Äôve seen my cousins do it to themself and yeahhhhh.
Anxiety,f1pidei,t3_dafn8s,1569681301.0,"Aromatherapy!  Eating healthy doesn‚Äôt always mean having to go on a diet it just means making sure you have all the vitamins.  So the next suggestion would be not to eat out or eat fried foods also no sugar like sodas juice just natural ones.  Also bath and body works has an amazing selection of aromatherapy lotions.  Regularly exercising and writing in a journal (positive things only) help a lot.  Therapy is also a huge help,sometimes it‚Äôs just nice to talk to someone about how you are feeling"
funny,f1phyds,t1_f1pdlfu,1569680967.0,Nope I lied lol I found it (https://youtu.be/55F2niZw_38)  from infinite challenge
funny,f1phtzg,t1_f1pdlfu,1569680870.0,I think it‚Äôs from a show called Running man
Anxiety,f1phmmm,t3_dafzga,1569680710.0,So if you go in with what car you have in mind as well as price and down payment (if you are using one or if you are going to get your car traded have it appraised at a different place like car max first to compare the price to the dealer if that‚Äôs the route you are going with) it makes it easier for the salesman to find what you need.  It isn‚Äôt necessarily the salesman that‚Äôs the shady person it‚Äôs more of the contract or finance member because they try to up sell you on warranty and what not.  But don‚Äôt forget the smaller payments you do the longer you will have to pay for it.  Honestly some guys don‚Äôt even get anything from making a deal because the ppl who come in prepared with the mind set of what they want and how much they are willing to pay for it.  You can also ask the return policy or if they allow you to test it~
Anxiety,f1ph4ab,t3_dag2qi,1569680321.0,Yeah I had my first major one on a ten hour flight over the water....fml right lol the had some person who had medical experience on the flight as well as talking to a doctor over the phone.  Long story short they gave me something to knock me out.  Even now I‚Äôm having some anxiety telling me I need to freak out but just like someone else posted before me it‚Äôs best to recognize your anxiety and not to ignore it.  My therapist also said ignoring it makes it worse just say oh hey hello and do something to relax your mind like some light stretches math problems or even sing to help you gain control of your breathing and to calm down.  I just recently went to my first appointment with a therapist last week and it was so helpful!  Also don‚Äôt google symptoms and stuff sometimes it can make you trigger yourself üò∞
Anxiety,f1mrtx9,t3_da26id,1569600743.0,I had my first session like two days ago and I was just as nervous as you are!  Honestly it was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made!  I thought that talking about it would trigger me but it didn‚Äôt and she even talked though it with me to help me understand that I‚Äôm in a safe place and that I wouldn‚Äôt be doing this alone because she is there for me to help me.  I did cry because it felt so good to know I wouldn‚Äôt be alone.  You can even tell them that you are afraid because there is no judgment.  I‚Äôm proud you are going and you are strong! You got this!
Anxiety,f1mreip,t3_da28el,1569600468.0,They also might sit you down first before you go into the main room to check see how your eyes focus which sometimes they push air to see which isn‚Äôt bad
Anxiety,f1mre3d,t3_da28el,1569600461.0,They also might sit you down first before you go into the main room to check see how your eyes focus which sometimes they push air to see which isn‚Äôt bad
Anxiety,f1ld1vr,t3_d9tpn0,1569551558.0,I cantttt I want too but I just can‚Äôt lol surprisingly the Ellen game show has helped me a lot
Anxiety,f1lcwwo,t1_f1lc82x,1569551460.0,Haha yeah I got some spray stuff also some roll on ones as well.  I actually recently got a bath and body works aromatherapy lotion called stress relief and lol it made my toddler fall asleep because I put it on when I was in the car and the smell went all through it üòÖ
Anxiety,f1lc3q7,t3_d9twau,1569550874.0,"Download podcasts in advance!  Hmmm also take brakes and make sure you do sleep well.  Bring stuff to challenge your mind so you aren‚Äôt alone in your thoughts.  Oh and anything with lavender! Aromatherapy stuff works really well with me during long drives,it might help you as well"
Anxiety,f1ki9mc,t1_f1k08ls,1569535958.0,I‚Äôve been dealing with anxiety for about 22 years so it took awhile.  I felt like I just broke after having the worst experience I ever had and I still feel kinda broken about it but I‚Äôm so happy with making that appointment.  I went to the doctors and he proscribed me some medication and I started to freak out about lack of sleep because it was keeping me up so he suggested a therapist and that‚Äôs how that happened lol
