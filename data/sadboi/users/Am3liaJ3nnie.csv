SkincareAddiction,fjoz6yj,t3_femfa4,1583538021.0,"Right now my daily routine is :
Morning - CeraVe flaming facial cleanser, differin gel, The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc, clean and clear essentials dual action moisturizer 

Night - Biore deep clean charcoal cleanser, The Ordinary Niacinamide 10% + Zinc, and Clinique moisturizer 

My face is getting better but I’m concerned about large pores and the overall redness.

I also have tried a pore vacuum a few times but not enough to see results yet."

Anxiety,ez17594,t3_czqtqt,1567645813.0,"Oh yeah, huge problem for me. The slightest anxiety gives me a stomach ache and nausea.anything more serious (like right now fighting with my boyfriend) full blown stomach cramps, possible throwing up, can’t eat for days. Then after I can eat again my stomach doesn’t feel well when I eat."
AskReddit,ez15c2p,t1_eyzel8k,1567645236.0,"THIS. I’m a TSS, I work mostly with kids with ADHD and you literally have to tell them or they won’t stop. They can talk for hours about every single topic that comes up and I used to feel really bad interrupting but they generally don’t see it that way. Once I got used to it at work it’s really easy doing it with anyone now just simply changing the topic or ending a conversation, not always in the same manner but you feel less rude politely ending a convo with an adult when you tell 7 year olds to be quiet or talk about something else all day."
interracialdating,ewp6rv0,t3_cpf1xk,1565634670.0,"I’m a white female and my boyfriend is black and we have dealt with very similar things but from strangers not friends. It happens all the time in stores or other busy places that people will walk in between us or in front of one of us in a line separating us because they think we’re not together. 
It’s funny that your boyfriend tells you to be the bigger person because it’s the opposite in my relationship. My boyfriend is obviously aware of it but he doesn’t acknowledge it happening and when I want to speak up he tells me to ignore it."

rant,ewfwcny,t1_ewfw7ne,1565368771.0,Feeling offended is a very incorrect way to describe someone being discriminated against because of they’re race or sexual orientation.
rant,ewfw3kv,t1_ewfvslx,1565368623.0,"Well for starters I’m not part of the “you people” you’re questioning, I’m a white straight female. Generally you find that people who do not understand/agree with groups such as LGBTQ or black lives matter are straight white people. Straight white people have never been discriminated against so they do not need a support group. It’s not about people “not being killed anymore”. People in these groups are discriminated against every day and without a group to go to they often feel alone and probably terrified."

You can get it on amazon and usually Walmart or Lowe’s carries it and it’s not expensive at all."
plants,eta3nu4,t3_cakuf2,1562611488.0,"That’s a beautiful plant! It definitely needs some water, that’s why the leaves look shriveled and are falling off.

I’ve had older black women makes comments about the way my boyfriend dresses saying “you get with a white girl and they dress you like that” no I do not choose what my boyfriend wears. I think a lot of black women have a big problem with it just like black men have a problem with you. Also I’ve noticed that people in Philly are much more “in your face” about things like that and I get more comments here than I do where I’m originally from (small town, central PA). Sometimes it’s easy to ignore, sometimes it really gets under my skin."

germanshepherds,eq0b7to,t1_eq09wdy,1559681403.0,"Unfortunately we don’t know much at all about her life before us. The shelter told us the previous owner surrendered her because she didn’t get along with their cat. They also told us not to pet her over the head because it scares her, which it does, she backs away with her ears down and eyes closed. She also rarely barks which is strange for her breed and when she does it’s always when she’s playing with a toy alone on the other side of the room as us. It might be a stretch but I’m thinking her previous owner tried to train her not to bark by punishing her or hitting her."

When she chews on our fingers we step over the baby gate we have set up and then our back to her until she walks away. It doesn’t seem to be working yet but I think she will realize that the biting ends play time. She is getting really good with playing fetch and brings the ball back. 
I’ve also noticed that she will guide my hands with her mouth, like if she wants a belly rub she’ll drag my hand to her side or when she wants me to pick up the ball she grabs my arm."
