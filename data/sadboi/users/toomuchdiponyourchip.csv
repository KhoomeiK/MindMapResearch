relationship_advice,ezw9g9t,t1_ezw1zot,1568211365.0,thank you
BreakUp,ezw9f3e,t1_ezw8vf2,1568211342.0,ok thank you
relationship_advice,ezvi5ga,t1_ezvdzn0,1568179126.0,"ouch that’s really really difficult. for me i asked him if he wanted it to be over, because he wasn’t really being clear with what he wanted and i needed him to say he was sure for me to fully move on and process. but he said he wasn’t sure and that rly fucked me over cuz i keep hoping he’ll come back."
relationship_advice,ezv7pgv,t1_ezv6ftf,1568169402.0,"ok thanks. this guy was also my first love, and i genuinely believed he would be my last. for me the break up was kind of out of nowhere and he did not even know if he was sure he wanted to end it, so i got 0 closure which makes it even harder to emotionally accept it’s over. so i’m guessing my situation is more like ur first."
relationship_advice,ezv5v9k,t1_ezv5cbn,1568167982.0,oh ok that would actually make a lot of sense. thank you.
BreakUp,ezt592u,t1_ezsynqu,1568121644.0,"i feel similar, but i’m trying to tell myself it’s over because i have a feeling we won’t end up back together and i just have hope that we will."
BreakUp,ezskgpb,t1_ezsker5,1568095146.0,"only like 3 days. we were on kinda a break for a bit? he wasn’t sure what he wanted and he needed some space. that was about 3 weeks ago and 3 days ago he ended it. he said he wasn’t even sure if this was what he wanted when he ended it too, which makes this all so much more confusing."
BreakUp,ezskdx3,t1_ezsk9hh,1568095049.0,ok thank you.
BreakUp,ezskc96,t1_ezsk91t,1568094995.0,yes i agree i am probably still in shock. i just lost my best friend and i can’t believe it. he meant the world to me.
BreakUp,ezsjplj,t1_ezd6q6s,1568094244.0,"thank you, it’s just hard because he was my best friend, and i’m worried i will never be able to get over him."
BreakUp,ezc2sn8,t3_d0chi3,1567829022.0,the same exact thing happened to me today. i obviously can’t offer advice bought thought it would help to know someone else is in the same place.
relationship_advice,ey0235b,t1_ey014iy,1566673322.0,"we did not live together, but we were together for 2 years as well. and i feel the same as i suffer from anxiety and hes all i can think about. and of course i want him to stay with me, but i think he will end it, which sucks but i just want him to be happy. i am so sorry about your situation. i keep thinking about the whole thing as everything happens for a reason, and if he ends it then it was not meant to work out, which really sucks to think, but it has helped me a little bit and maybe it will help you too."
relationship_advice,ey01k74,t1_ey013cu,1566673113.0,let me know if more are needed
relationship_advice,ey01i3m,t1_ey013cu,1566673089.0,"yes, we are both 15, which i know is so young but he was and is my best friend and it just really hurts. and i know it probably seems like ""oh she is just 15 she will be fine"" which i don't blame anyone for thinking lol. but he was my best friend and i could never see my life without him in it. it just really hard because i miss him and want him to know i care about him but i also need to give him his space."
relationship_advice,ey00u08,t1_ey00e4z,1566672831.0,"yes for me, the relationship is not fully over, he just needed space to see what he wanted because he still had feelings he just wasn’t happy and didn’t know why. so he wants to figure out if he wants to end it or work on it. but it feels like it’s going to be over and it sucks not knowing what to do because it’s not fully final for me. i’m not talking to him to give him his space. but it really sucks and i’m crying on the daily and i miss him because he was also my best friend."
relationship_advice,ey00f9c,t1_exzznxm,1566672664.0,"I know but when we first stared to talk about our relationship he said he wanted it to be over, but he still loved me. He even hugged me and would not let go and kissed me. He then said it was over and I grabbed my things to leave, and he started to freak out and said he was ""ruining his life"" so he said he needed space. I am aware that the relationship is pretty much over, and I expect by the end of this ""space"" that he will call it off."
relationship_advice,exzz7bf,t1_exzy9o8,1566672248.0,"me too, it really sucks but everyone keeps telling me it will eventually get better, so just remember that."
relationship_advice,exzxjvv,t3_cuw6ym,1566671788.0,"i’m going through something similar, i’m sorry this isn’t much help but i thought maybe it would help u to know that ur not alone."
