Anxiety,fojavvk,t3_g7nta9,1587815113.0,"well said, I've often thought this. It's why I find advice from other people who experience anxiety to be more useful than advice offered by those who haven't, although they might mean well."

It is also worth making the most of when you actually do feel like eating. Having said this, I'm not sure how well those things actually work because I have yet to regain any weight."
