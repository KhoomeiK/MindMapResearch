ptsd,fi86gme,t3_f6zhl4,1582234342.0,"I've found it helpful to join democratic socialist groups bc I found those folks, even when they haven't had similar experiences, recognize the evil and injustice of poverty and homelessness that most people don't ever think about. Like there is just no excuse given our collective resources for this kind of suffering, and it made me feel more sane to be around people who also thought this was a no brainer."
CPTSD,fi863ww,t3_f6uyh5,1582234155.0,"Hmmm so I'm almost hesitant to say this because I don't want to inspire any unnecessary fear or distrust of others, but this might be worth considering: Abusive people are really good at picking up on when someone else has been abused and is still vulnerable. I've heard that it's good to be mindful of who seems too eager to get close to you too quickly, esp if you're lonely bc others can kinda tell and an abusive person will take advantage of that fact and of our difficulties recognizing red flags. BUT most ppl are not like this and the other folks on here had some good suggestions for gradually developing friendships!"

I hadn't been in a relationship or had sex with anyone else either. I don't think it's crazy to not realize what happened wasn't normal, like plenty of mainstream porn eroticizes violence. There's a difference between being kinky and liking to hit your gf in bed bc you're an abusive misogynist but there kinda hasn't been a cultural convo about this..."
adultsurvivors,fhrc0qa,t3_f49nrv,1581822463.0,Something very similar happened to me. It was very confusing. I thought he had an unusual fetish or something and felt like I needed to be supportive. I don't know why I didn't believe him when he said things about how he liked hurting me. I never really said no they just kinda happened and I froze and sometimes I said yes and I don't really know why. I'm really terrified he's done worse things or will do them but I don't think anyone would believe me if I said anything and there's no evidence so nothing legal could happen. I really struggle to wrap my head around what happened.
CPTSD,fhgwleq,t3_f33jzh,1581582412.0,Wow ya this definitely happens to me. For whatever reason I find kindness and compliments really triggering. I think for me it's because it sort of prompts my inner critic to harp on why the person is wrong about me.

CPTSD,f9fa0tg,t3_e4sdsp,1575263906.0,"I respectfully disagree. I think people can be advantaged or disadvantaged by their backgrounds, but systematic oppression like racism or sexism is something that happens to a person in virtue of the social groups (Black, woman, disabled, poor, etc) they belong to. People with CPTSD have totally valid struggles and definitely face disadvantages, but not because they belong to a group of people who have CPTSD. I think any structural oppression we do experience has to do with our other identities or else barriers related to ableism/a lack of a social safety net. Sorry I study something related to this and have lots of feelings üòÇ

Edit: agreed that people who lack certain experiences have a hard time understanding those who do, and in this way the phenomenon is like when ppl not oppressed by their race, for ex, don't perfectly understand the experiences of those who are."

CPTSD,f2dyimw,t3_dcyy8d,1570170631.0,"I've had what sounds like a really different experience to the ones you all have shared: my father actually abused my brother and I, but the men's rights activist judge overseeing our case bought the totally bogus assertion that my mom was alienating my father. No matter what we and our social workers said he would waive it away by telling us we'd been brainwashed. This kind of abuse is real, legitimate, and awful, but historically it has also been used to classify women (largely) as hysterical bitches in the face of credible allegations of abuse."

My abuser was a literal psychopath who convinced me his abuse of me was a fun kinky thing where he manipulated me into thinking I was being judgemental or abusive whenever I tried to assert boundaries. Also a bit worried bc I think kink can be really healthy and positive but when so much of mainstream porn depicts violent subordination of women under the guise of kink... Like that's kinda concerning. I've had so many friends share stories of tinder dates randomly choking them bc ""women like that stuff"". I always wonder if the person is kinky or just a sadistic misogynistic."
rapecounseling,f1awnr4,t3_d8e9bs,1569311191.0,"I'm so sorry this is happening. Many university employees are mandatory reporters, which means that if you tell them you were assaulted they are legally obligated to report it to Title IX (other Redditors: pls correct me if I'm wrong!) You can ask people if they are mandatory reporters, and your schools health and safety/mental health offices will probably have employees who are exempt from being a mandatory reporter.

CPTSD,f0xs8mp,t1_f0xrh9j,1569044341.0,"Honestly, I got a bit worried when you said he also continued having sex with you after you told him to stop and choked you after you explicitly said not to do that. I think sometimes people think things are sexy and spontaneous (hey, people do that in porn!) and when they learn their partner doesn't feel the same they're devasted at the thought of hurting someone else. But when you tell them how their behavior hurts you and establish boundaries and they do the thing again that's really concerning. Especially when they turn their bad behavior into a pity party for themselves. Although I might totally be projecting here lol"

Personally-speaking, I'm noticing that in the comments you've mentioned several instances of him breaking your consent in really insidious ways. My abusive ex did stuff like that and it took me a while to come to terms with it and the effect it had on me, especially with the ""kinky"" (read: degrading, sadistic, non-consentual shit that has been way too normalized) sex stuff. You have a right to be respected in a relationship and that kind of stuff is really not ok. People absolutely have the ability to not rape or violate other people, and it doesn't have to be this way.

survivorsofabuse,eysh67f,t3_cyaynw,1567398054.0,"Wow a lot of this sounds really familiar. I'm sorry this happened to you, and it's not your fault. It can be weirdly hard to recognize abusive behavior and also to get away from it, and in the grand scheme of things, he's the one who is reasonable for his actions. Idk how long ago this was but for me time really helped. I thought I'd never be able to feel safe again or stop thinking about what happened but with supportive friends, self-care, and time I can go awhile without thinking about it. In the short term, I became involved in feminist advocacy/community organizing. I suspect behavior like his is an instance if some much larger patterns of violence against women and being able to learn more about these and take action against them helped me work out some anger and feelings of vulnerability/hopelessness.

Metaphysics- above quote, could do something fun on the metaphysics of time and paradoxes with the time turner, non-existence death and dying also seem apt
Epistemology- moral epistemology questions in Harry's concern over his likeness to Voldemort (how can we know we're doing the right thing?)
Political- the books give ya a lot to think about evil, fascism, and the bystanders that enable these
Good luck!"
