I know from experience that transferring can be very stressful. I definitely wished that I had someone who understood my situation. If you need help or someone to talk to feel free to pm me."

Phonology was mildly interesting because it explained why pronunciations weren't exactly what I thought they were. After that I lost interest and did not understand the point of the others. That being said, the small unit with various topics did have some interesting things in it. I especially liked the one about different writing systems. Idk maybe I like linguistics as it pertains to language learning and not the highly theoretical stuff. Now that you mention it, I do think I would like the subfields that you suggested.

Is it possible that I like applied linguistics more than theoretical linguistics?
