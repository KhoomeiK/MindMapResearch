You keep looking for that cinematic moment or idea that becomes the turning point in which you get better but it never happens and when it does it doesn't work. Then one day you notice that you got better and don't even know how or when. You see Bojack going for these kind of thing the whole series from his Secretariat days up until the view from halfway down. You also see him try to help people with movie-like gestures with it always backfiring, like when he gets Eddy to fly or convinces Kelsey to break into a museum. The last episode fits perfectly with that."
