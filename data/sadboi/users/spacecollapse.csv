Fibromyalgia,fj3glt7,t3_fb3aro,1582982931.0,"Idk if this is an unhelpful comment or not but personally hot baths make me feel so much better. If that would help her too, I'd recommend starting a bath with some nice smelling bath bombs, candles and light music with dim lighting. You can even buy her a bath tray from amazon and put her favorite book or tablet on it. Give her some water/wine/her favorite drink and let her chill in there as long as she needs. It gives her relaxation with no expectations for a while, and it may help her pain & sore muscles. There is even bath salts designed for Fibro at walmart, it is a purple bag that says ""for chronic aches and pains"". 
(You may have to help her in and out of the tub though.) 
Baths are my favorite self care method lol"

AskReddit,fitnb2m,t3_f9kd1v,1582724863.0,"When I had sleep paralysis for the second time in my life, and felt (something) sitting on my chest. I couldn't breathe. It sounds stupid but it felt like this (thing) was reaching into my chest. Whatever it was, it felt physically hot, and I got a sense of dread. It lasted for several minutes, and I could not move or scream. All I could do was pray, and I didn't know what else to do. After about a minute of praying, I felt whatever was on my chest disappear, and I could move, and breathe again. 
I know this isn't like anything physically I could have died from, but it was scary and I felt like I was going to die."

Obviously life quality isnt where you want it to be, I know. Pain makes life unbearable whether it be physical or emotional.

AmItheAsshole,f7c6k7x,t3_dv9ogm,1573585518.0,"Yta big time. Why not adopt if you HAVE to have children? You obviously do not care about anyone else except for yourself, your husband and a HYPOTHETICAL CHILD that doesnt even exist yet. You are putting a baby who doesnt even exist yet (if you decide to not adopt) over a living breathing person (Sarah) with their own life and feelings and opinions.

You do not care about Sarah, her feelings, point of view, and are so clouded by your own selfishness.
Sarah doesn't want to ruin her body, her mental health, and she DOES NOT WANT CHILDREN. THAT INCLUDES GIVING BIRTH. It is VALID to not want to have children or give birth, and just because she has a working reproductive system does not mean you are entitled to use it!! 
You are the asshole and I hope you feel bad."
