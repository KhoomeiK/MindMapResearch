EtsySellers,fr57gou,t1_fr4mi4f,1589903834.0,"Hi there, Okay I took a quick look. Your shirts are cute and original which is a great start. 
You definitely need better pictures, and iron the shirts. Easy! Also try flat laying them, it will give you better pictures than hanging them. Just do it on a white sheet. 
You need descriptions about the shirts. What is the fit? what is the brand? What inspires you to make clouds or your design. Why are your shirts better than others or what makes them stand apart. How do you make them? If you make them yourself that is a big advantage to print on demand shirts.  It doesn't have to be super wordy but descriptive. Your titles and tags need work. The more descriptive the better. 
You need a better about you blurb. What inspired you to make fun shirts, where do you get ideas from? Are you a student? 
Also, are you using insta? Snap chat? Tik tok? Tik Tok is a great platform and you can show your creative process.
I hope this helps and I hope you find success, you have great bones and you can do it!!!"

If you think you can reasonably sell inexpensive items and can afford to refund the few that may not arrive, then that's up to you. 
I have a shop that sells items under $20 that fit in a regular mail envelope and don't send with tracking but I know that i am on the hook to refund if they don't arrive. I have yet to refund anyone luckily. I have another shop that sells $100 items and they all get tracking."
