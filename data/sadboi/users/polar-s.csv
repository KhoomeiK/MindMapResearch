Read genres of books or watch movies you have never considered. Try activities even if you're not really interested. But the really important part is to not let other ppl eclipse yourself, and for me at least, that was so normalized that I couldn't stop myself from doing it. So you do for sure have to kind of isolate, and that is the worst part. But when you finally finally FINALLY stop thinking about other people, after all the crying and the aching heart and the emptiness, you will find that you do have your own thoughts."

depressionregimens,fgua17e,t3_f0eza5,1581115844.0,"The problem is everyone reacts differently to meds, so even if someone has the exact same symptoms, one medication may work for them and not for you, or vise versa. It has to do with your natural neurochemical balance, but unfortunately there isn't any way to test that yet. Sucks but the only way to see what works is trial and error right now, which is exhausting and can be very discouraging if it takes a long time. I was switching meds once every year or two for the first ten years or so I was medicated and nothing seemed to really work well. I have found that a routine and keeping my physical body healthy helps a lot in the effectiveness of drugs, and when I'm not consistent with them my reactions to the meds are less consistent as well. Sadly treating depression is a very long trail of exhausting baby steps, but you do slowly get somewhere else over time. I know it feels like swimming through mud, but eventually it gets a few degrees easier. Good luck!"
