It can be an intimidating thing to expose yourself in front of your coworkers unintentionally and they can help until your ready. Other than that you simply need to find a way to come to terms with it. Can I share with you my experience?

 I used to work kitchens and had to always keep the sleeves fully rolled down on my chef coat. It was hot and difficult to work with, and people made comments constantly. I owned it as my style and it played off well enough.  But I then got a job where we didn't wear coats, just short sleeves shirts. I couldn't take it anymore. I've hidden myself for so long. I looked back on my scars and realized that if I felt that things didn't matter back then why should they matter now? 

Live life as best fits your comfort. If hiding your scars is more comfortable than not, then by all means do what you can to be comfortable with yourself as you do so.
If you're like me and find it just doesn't matter then just go for it and wear what you want, fuck anyone that has anything negative to say about our bodies and thank you to all the people who've seem more than just our scars."

A rasp or file will help shorten the work, or 60 grit sandpaper (""Gator"" brand at Lowe's is fantastic).

Tubs obviously are capped and I use a small bowl as a lid for my mug, which doubles are a place to build lather into.  You should definitely protect your soap from debris of any kind, but how you do so isn't so important.  My Ogallala gets dried out and cracked, but that doesn't affect the performance. Either bloom with some hot water to smooth it out again, or just use a wet brush and pick up the soap you need to build a lather as per usual.  

So you can use a small bowl to lid your soap and also lather into, or use any other covering to protect the soap and just face/hand lather.  BTW coconut shells are great for lather bowls/lids, they're cheap and fairly easy to clean up for use. I like bowls to lather into because face lathering can take some time or be a little messy (depending on your skill), as can hand lathering. Plus bowls are easy to rinse and dry before use, ensuring your soap as well as your brush is free of debris. On top of it all I've had no issues whatsoever with soaps drying out and cracking, no loss in performance or fragrance. One man's POV so take it as you will."
