BPD,fnyibg8,t3_g4n0w8,1587363966.0,"My only friend for 4 years. She abandoned me ( and her other friends ) for her bf. Me and her were close. She lived a block away from me so we hanged out almost everyday together or we text or called everyday. Over the course of our friendship, she had been exposed to a lot of my trauma and I was exposed to hers. Out of everybody I know, she knows me better than anyone. But I think I became a burden later on. My bpd started to manifest and get worst and I relied on her company too much.

I haven’t spoken to her since Oct. We got in a major fight after I just got out of the mental ward and all I wanted to do was take her out without her bf. I’ve seen her in public about 2 times but she always ignores me. 

I would say I’m 50/50. Since our fight I’ve grown up in a sense. I finally got from out of her shadow and started making progress towards my own identity. I got a job, stopped smoking, and am more social. But I still think about her and how much I could use her around. I was more comfortable around her than anybody. I have a bad relationship with new people now. I can’t seem to trust people with the real me in result to her using the private things we talked about against me."

BPD,fns9h61,t3_g3mpbv,1587216443.0,"I get how you feel. I would say that you should try not to think further on what they say. Personally I’m surrounded by people that have strong opinions about topics and they make me mad but I’m the type to just forget about and bring it up later. For those people talking about Covid, you could ask them to not talk about it around you. If they know you have mental illness then they should be comfortable slowing up. Don’t watch tv or covid related news. Personally it was making me wanna kill myself just how much covid related stuff was being said. My sister’s a conspiracy theorist to so she was watching the videos every time we hanged out. I just try to get her to watch something or listen to music. I think what’s keeping me sane and aware at the same time is knowing the cases in my state and the death toll. Or I look at America’s in general. I’ve already had problems with the news. I’m scared of climate change so when the weather came on I got my mom to change the channel. So I’ve been avoiding the news before this happened and I’ve had less little breakdowns.

So out of all that lol I think you should 1) don’t watch the news. Just pick the things out of the pandemic that’s important to you because it can become depressing and scary if you know everything going on in the world at once 2) if your family is talking about it around you just ask “can you guys not talk so much about it?” 3) to avoid the splitting, don’t think about their opinion to much. I just forget. If it’s hard to do that then just distance yourself for a bit but still talk to them so it makes it easier to avoid spilting completely

Tip: some people do need to be remove from your life,Some people could really be toxic to you."

relationship_advice,fmzfp8a,t1_fmzfggg,1586518818.0,I know what she doesn’t crack up to what she’s going through but I’m honestly her last hope because my parents are tired. Their just gonna kick her out because she hasn’t even been with us for a whole month and she’s sneaked back with him twice and the first time she came home with scratches and cuts on her neck and acted like she hadn’t seen him since we last saved her.
relationship_advice,fmzf5yo,t1_fmzeljg,1586518262.0,"Well the only one really is my relationship with my sister. Before she got in this relationship, while she was in school, she made me lie for her from age 12-15 She would sneak people in the house all the time and told me to never tell or she would never speak to me again. I’ve had to threaten some of her past boyfriends because they would try to hurt her. That part in my life really ate at me because my parents would come to asking about noises at night or was she doing something and I would lie to them for her and I hate lying in general"
relationship_advice,fmzevoi,t1_fmze61b,1586517957.0,"I appreciate the advice. He does have a kid ( actually three but two are with their mom because of dv ). She cares a lot about the kid but I know she doesn’t stay with him because of the kid. The kid’s a brat. She cries when she doesn’t get something, makes messes all the time and expects to get something every time she goes somewhere. It’s actually a problem because she knows what she’s doing. He didn’t discipline her until my sister came along so he would buy her anything she wanted to get her to be quiet. He doesn’t abuse his daughter. Plus I doubt that my sister could get custody because she was subpoenaed to testify against him for dv and she didn’t show up. She has a lot of unpaid tickets and she can’t keep a job plus she smokes weed 24/7"
relationship_advice,fmzdwxl,t1_fmzd6u7,1586516899.0,Thank you :) I did that. I kicked her out after she disappeared for two weeks when I cried to her telling her that it’s causing too stress. It backfired tho bc her boyfriend texted me and told us to come get her. They had been fighting for days.

Are we just supposed to suffer another two years until she’s ready? She won’t expect help. We’re always scared. I love my sister more than anybody in the world and it’s so hard being the only one that has faith in her. I think ever time she comes home will be the time she leaves him but when she goes, I feel betrayed and sad and everybody tells me “ I told you so “."
relationship_advice,fmzd0e7,t1_fmzcsc0,1586515866.0,I know :( but we don’t know what to do. It’s just a cycle over and over with no chance of things changing. What are we supposed to do?
relationship_advice,fmzcl6o,t1_fmzb1x0,1586515375.0,"This is the most understanding of the comments. I totally agree. But it’s really tiring and scary. We have tried everything I mean everything. My mom tried to get a therapist but she doesn’t want to want to go, our aunt got killed by her boyfriend so we’re terrified of a repeat. When the police got called on them, he was put into jail temporarily and all she had to do was go to court and testify. They even issued an restraining order. But literally a week after she unblock his number and he made her not show up and left yet again. It also doesn’t help that I’m the middle man. My parents try to talk to her but she doesn’t listen to them only me and her boyfriend always texts me when he’s “ done with her “ and wants us to come get her. She has called me during their fights multiple times. I’m the only one left that has faith in her. Everybody I mean EVERYBODY has got tired of her. Even my friends are tired of her. It also doesn’t help that she doesn’t even wanna try now. She once had a job and was able to leave him for 4 months but since then she quits every job and gets money from other people. I finally got my first job and she ran through my money to buy weed. It’s not her fault but after all the chances she has been given and can’t seem to understand that everybody is done she gets mad at me when I try to help her avoid him. She just won’t. We were going to buy her a new phone since that what she needed for him to stop blowing up his phone and she left before we could give it to her. 

We don’t know what to do. She won’t take in account of all of the things he done and we’re literally getting drained emotionally, financially, and mentally. I’ve been going to therapy since their relationship started and mostly all my sessions are based on her and the strain it’s been causing."
relationship_advice,fmz7jhq,t3_fybys9,1586509498.0,I would just stop texting him. Or at least address it with him. I had a friend like that that would take a minute to reply and then send a dry text. It would literally make me lose my mind so I just ended it since we weren’t that close
offmychest,fmz7541,t3_fyc0rz,1586509043.0,Don’t hate yourself for that. U can still avoid him nobody said that if you go to school with them means you have to talk to them.

I stop blaming myself for some the crazier things I did to my fp ( 1. Some of things I did had to be done ) but we get in a mindset and once we’ve done what we felt was right at the time, we see what we did and how crazy or harmful we may seem. It’s ok.
