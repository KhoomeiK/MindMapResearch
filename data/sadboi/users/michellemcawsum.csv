AskWomenOver30,fqd2fpv,t3_gi3n1i,1589277385.0,"My ex boyfriend of 2 yrs broke up with me about a month before our lockdown started. At first I was terrified of being alone, no friends (close by) and no family. But it has been amazing. I’ve been able to reframe my thoughts (he told me he didn’t love me - and in my experience no one who was supposed to has ever loved me) and at the end of the day realise I love me, I’m awesome. And that is enough. 
It’s been 3 months now and I haven’t heard from him at all, and it has really cemented the fact he did not/does not care about me. Which is actually great! Next time I’ll know my doubts were real, and not make excuses for avoidant and uncaring behaviour. 
I’ve also managed to go from drowning financially to getting my head above water! 
And 3rd I got to hang out with my dog Nacho, who is so cool and sweet and fun, all day everyday! 
If not for this quarantine, I would have busied myself and thrown myself into my social life and not addressed  how I felt or want to feel. I still have things to work through but man am I better off! 
It’s very hard to balance this feeling with knowing I shouldn’t be celebrating at a time when people are adversely affected."

LetsNotMeet,fqbq7ay,t1_fqb1m8z,1589241796.0,"The whole thing seems fishy. Beyond just the lack of security.
Investigating picture frames and THEN the window after an incident of clunking on the window the night before? There was no foreign object that broke thru, nothing on the floor? And the trash cans didn’t seem out of place? How would anyone have broken the window on the second floor? 
How do you just forget that happened when it led to you sleeping in your mother’s bed? 
Even if it were kids, why is there a toddler with them shrieking in delight? 
Not being comfortable to talk with your neighbour? Because you’re not close with them? When they have a security system you could get them to check? Especially if it points in the direction of your room? 
Also surely the dog would have barked? If it barks when it’s let outside? 
And the complete lack of reporting it, even to the non emergency line. It’s not making a big deal, it’s creating a paper trail if something else happens later. 
If something like this happens to someone else, please don’t do what OP did and just post on reddit. Call the police, report it ASAP!"

My ex and I had just recently broken up so it was kinda therapeutic to see Rebecca act out and scheme in ways that we’re all too scared/reasonable to do..
Valencia’s growth was one of my favourite things about the show. I really liked Heather and Maya. And Darryl!
I prefer old Greg to new Greg, but Nathaniel is best for Rebecca, and I really hoped they’d end up together. Josh irritated me the whole time! 
What I loved the most about the series is how they handled her mental health, I was recently diagnosed with adhd and in women it can present very similar to BPD in some ways. I love how her friends stuck by her, and really supported her. 

I was so sad when it ended, felt like I lost all my friends.
It really helped me get thru my breakup, and diagnosis, and set me in the right direction for healing and learning more about myself.

LetsNotMeet,foxmmq5,t3_g9ymi0,1588148869.0," Something similar happened to me and my friend when we we about 9 or 10. It was the weekend and I lived about 4 houses away from my primary school and we had decided to go walk down there and see if any sports were being played at the big public field that was adjacent to our school field. As we walked thru the school a white man with dark hair was jogging around the school, we said hi when he first passed us, but then he kept jogging/looping around near to us and something told me this was a bit weird. So I said to my friend we should go to the line of about 4 or 5 bushy trees that were at a spot between the school field and the big public field, to see if he was following us, as you wouldn’t just jog past this spot. We ran down and hid in the trees and about 2mins later this guys comes into the trees and crouches down and say “hello girls” and I just screamed and cried and he raised his hands and backed away and jogged off. My friend goes “why did you scream? I wanted to know what he wanted!” We ran back to my place and told my mum and stepdad and we came back to check the school but he wasn’t there. 
That and some other encounters have really affected me. This one wasn’t so bad. 
Also over 20 yrs later and still annoyed that my then friend told me off for screaming."

AskWomen,fo92d6o,t3_g64fkz,1587608979.0,"We broke up in early February. He just recently came back from an overseas holiday of 5 weeks. For 3 weeks it was back to normal then one day he just said we should talk about the future, and he doesn’t feel a spark and dated me for 2 yrs and 3 months and thought maybe something would happen. That he doesn’t know what love is. I felt my heart sink. And I said well I can’t be with someone who doesn’t know how they feel about me and I left. Then we met a few days later so I could clarify a couple of things ( did he meet someone else? Etc) I said I wanted to end things on a good note so that in the future if I see him again I won’t be angry or bitter. 
It’s been just over 2 months since then. Some days I’m confident and happy. Other days I don’t know who I am and spiral down thinking of the things he said (I’m too affectionate, that made him uncomfortable because I loved him more than he liked me). I don’t have family that I’m close with and he was like home to me. Why am I so unloveable? I think I’m smart and funny and kind, why is that not enough? The thing that I loved about our relationship was that we were friends for 2 yrs prior. I didn’t feel a “spark” like how I had with previous guys which fizzled out, but instead I felt comfortable and safe and happy. 
But now it feels like everything was a lie, I can’t look back on “happy times” because apparently he wasn’t feeling it. I had no idea he felt that way. He always said we were good and he was happy whenever I brought anything up. I feel so stupid."

Maybe he’ll realise later in life how good we actually had it, or maybe he will find his spark and I’ll find something better for me.
