The primary subject was clearly CPU PERFORMANCE not hz.  

TL;DR  
Intel is capable of pushing more frames than AMD CPUs.  

Where did the 210hz and 244hz came from now?
Dude, it doesn't matter which GAME OR SETUP, INTEL is able to push more frames, it doesn't matter if you have a 2070 Super pushing 200+ frames or a 2080ti with higher settings pushing 200+ frames in any game. The fact is that because of the better IPC Intel is able to push more frames than AMD, but this becomes meaningless when the frames are under about ~170 frames because then the difference is very small maybe 5-10FPS that is meaningless when playing on a 144hz monitor. Also for the AMD fanboy inside you (yes I also like AMD more) since last 2 years I had AMD CPUs 1600, 2600, 2700x (now) and my next CPU won't be a 9900k but the mighty 3900X or the 4900X (not sure if it's worth waiting and buying a new mobo)"

I'm answering people this way because my english sucks and writing long sentences isn't the hardest thing but I'm low-key afraid to write too much that will confuse people even more.

""You said working in the US is your dream"" = yes
""because people in your city act like millionaire,"" = no, it's not my dream because of that but because how much things you're able to do in the US and not in Germany.
""just want to have beer and cars are expensive."" = It sounds like I want to do this, no, that's wrong.

Some cars are more expensive than in the US, yes, but I was talking about T√úV... why?
For example you have a dream car that you want to build, you have the money but you don't poop money. So, you buy a sport/semi-racing suspension, in Germany your car Parts must have a thing called ""ABE"" that means, the parts must be compatible with your car, note: even if they are compatible and you can install it without any issues, it can be that your car isn't listed on the ABE so you can still install it but then you must do a thing called ""Einzelabhnahme"", you bring your car and they test and look at it. Lets say the suspension you bought is like... 2-3k but the ""Einzelabhnahme"" is more like 5-10k. You change your steering wheel, wheels, exhaust... yep... the ""Einzelabnahme"" will cost you more than the car parts. Do you have such a thing in US? Note: I saw people driving legaly dragsters on the streets. In Germany you can't even put all spoilers on your car even if they are NOT wider than your car.

I don't know how many hobbies you have but I have too many tbh with you and because of that... I would like to live in a country where I can live my life I would like to."
