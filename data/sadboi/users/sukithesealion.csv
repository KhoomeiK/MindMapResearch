There are (supposed to be) two of these knobs on either side. It's spring operated so you push them both inwards toward each other and the latches let go of the grooves they're in and then you can lift the window up and release the latches into grooves set higher in the frame. The top portion of the window does not move, just the bottom portion. Bc most of the knobs are missing, I'm able to insert a nail or screw or Ikea L tool into the hole(s) and then again push the latch inward."

EatingDisorders,fn5cqq0,t1_fn5c0ka,1586661483.0,"I definitely agree with GingerBuns - don't skip your next meal to punish yourself. Keep your routine as much as you can and if you feel the urge to binge come on, eat something like steamed broccoli first. Tell yourself you can have the thing you want, but you have to eat the broccoli and have a big glass of water. This has prevented a few binges for me bc after I eat that, I feel fuller and not as interested in the ice cream (and everything that would have followed). I also recommend taking a hot shower first. Honestly I use a hot shower for anything (anxiety, shame, binging, actual not feeling well, headaches)."
EatingDisorders,fn5bt2b,t3_fifqok,1586660812.0,"I can relate with so much of what you guys are sharing. ""Tricking"" your brain into not binging, not keeping food in the house, not keeping FLOUR (I thought I was alone in that, but I'm so glad I'm not), freezing things so slow you down... I would say I have trigger foods (ice cream, Nutella), but honestly when a serious urge comes (like you're not in control of your body and you see what you're doing and know it's wrong and hate yourself, but you can't stop) I just go from whatever is the sweetest to the least appetizing, like stale crackers. I don't think I have to explain the feeling of being so full, but still unable to stop until you're in literal pain - you guys seem like you've been there. 
I haven't seriously binged in a while since I started taking Contrave, but it's great to see this because people who don't struggle with control over food DO NOT get it. They think you're explaining a case of overeating when you say please don't bring cupcakes I will eat them all. Like no seriously, I will eat every cupcake and lick the plate for crumbs and then I'll go find something else and something else...
It's just really refreshing to see genuine understanding here."

So, I saw him one day and I said, ""hey I set this up back there but my dogs don't really want to use it. If ever your pup wants to sit out in the sun, feel free to use it."" Ever since that day, I get the impression that he thought that I thought he was mistreating his animal (which I do, but I definitely didn't show it) so he just hates me now. He now actively avoids his dog being outside when me and my dogs are."

I personally don't get the impression that the doggo doesn't want to be outside. When he's called (two minutes after being let out) he always ignores then for at least another two, which is also pretty frustrating because it's like, why don't you just walk downstairs and get him? Or better yet, why don't you just walk downstairs with him to begin with? 
As far as abuse goes, if this was that, this would definitely be a really tame example."

loseit,fjhg6xx,t1_fjhegvf,1583347498.0,"I also want to come back and talk about daily movement - it's not exercise to me. I park the farthest I can from my job and walk those 3 minutes. I take my dogs out for longer walks on nice days and short around the block walks on ugly days. I did try kickboxing for a while because I enjoyed it, but what I found was that after an hour of intense cardio, I would go home and binge eat. I realized that I couldn't continue and be a healthy eater. Walking at a leisurely pace more often is literally the best exercise for me. 

I don't have the space or interest in cooking for one, so I eat out a lot. I work 9-5 so I usually go out and buy a salad for lunch (or something not fried) and while I'm there, buy something for dinner (so I'm not tempted later) or hit up Whole Foods hot bar for dinner (I use the large soup container so I don't overeat). I almost immediately eat what I brought home because while I'm not immediately hungry, if I wait til 8 I will be and it can escalate.

All of this, while on Contrave."
loseit,fjhegvf,t3_fcyymg,1583346543.0,"Hey - so I have BED and I know what it's like to know you're overweight and it be a cyclical process of eating to comfort your sad feelings and then being more sad about being more fat. 

Like others have said, she knows she's fat, and she knows that you know she's fat. That probably stresses her out without you even saying anything. 

Here's how I stopped binging consistently - I got medicated. First, I tried phentermine which works well to suppress appetite and thoughts of food, but I found myself skipping meals and eating unhealthy quick food at the end of the day before bed. If she could be better than me (set alarms, force yourself to eat at those times, eat healthy foods) then this could be a great starting point for her. It's also supposed to help you drink more water. I can tell you, her biggest set back is that she can't STOP thinking about food and her weight. This will ERASE those thoughts and even give her confidence!

Next, I stopped phentermine and started Contrave - it's a mix of wellbutrin (antidepressant) and naltrexone (a drug given to addicts to prevent relapse - because she is addicted). It's not a opioid, so she'll be able to be on this long term. It's not as strong as the phentermine, but if taken consistently, when she feels the urge to binge instead of her feeling like she has no control over her body and choices, it will feel like a conversation that she has a say in. She'll crave food less but still get hungry appropriately. 

I would suggest this because right now, she may feel like she has no where to turn. I'm not knocking OEA, but that never worked for me. Someone recommended intermittent fasting which is a GREAT addition to these meds. I would say down the line that Contrave regularly and also a LOW dose of phentermine on the weekends (if she's more likely to binge eat on the weekends like me) will works literal wonders for her!

Both of the medications are TOOLS and not the answer! They HELP someone with BED control their cravings, but if you don't make the choice to eat healthy and add daily movement to your routine, you'll be back where you started. 

Hope this helps!"
relationships,fjgxexg,t1_fjgvl47,1583337421.0,"I'd also like to add that when he flew into his rage and said he'd try to lose weight, he suggested that I do it with him. I've gained some weight so I didn't mind this challenge, but the more I think about it the more I think that he's just using this as an excuse to make ME lose weight. Like I said, he's not one to often follow through so my concern is that I'm in this alone."
relationships,fjgvl47,t3_fd00ad,1583336384.0,"I honestly just wanted to come here and vent because this is not a new topic at all, per Reddit. 

My boyfriend snores like a freaking chainsaw. We recently got back together after 3 yrs of being apart and while he didn't snore before, he's making up for lost time in a real way. We don't live together, thank goodness, but he visits on the weekends which I really need to rejuvenate. I know and he knows that his weight gain is a huge factor - he's probably put on 30 lbs (which doesn't make him unattractive, except when I get no sleep, then he's the devil) and when I let him know that his snoring was a problem we knew he had two real options: 1. lose weight and 2. get a cpap machine. A machine is easily 2K so I didn't immediately encourage him to do this. He always talks about losing weight... as he calls me from the Hardy's drive through. I bought myself earplugs which do help, but he falls asleep nearly the moment his head touches the pillow, so I don't have a chance to call asleep first. I bought a humidifier because he thought it would help - the moment I stopped filling it and doing the work he stopped using it. I bought strips for his mouth to keep it closed at night, but he refused to try thinking that if he vomits at night he may choke. 

So, I couldn't take it anymore and told him the next time he stays over I'll be sleeping on the couch, which I thought was generous considering I don't snore and it's my bed/apartment. He flew off the handle talking about how my commenting on his snoring has made him start ""waking himself up"" even at his own house. In my opinion, waking himself up literally does no good and also, I don't think that's something that I did. I suggested he wear earplugs until he gets himself out of that habit (which was a little snarky because I've been wearing earplugs to deal with his snoring). He eventually said he'd ""save up"" and buy a machine. I don't want to give the impression he's less than perfect, and I know that I can do this too, but he often says things and doesn't follow through, so as incentive I'm not planning to sleep in the same bed as him until he actually buys the machine. He's the type that won't change unless he's literally forced. I get the impression that my happiness isn't enough of a motivator...

Yesterday I fantasized about sleeping next to him IN SILENCE. When he's not around, I sleep so well that my bed feels even more cloud-like. If I'm being honest, if I thought I had to deal with this forever I don't know that I could. It sounds ridiculous, but this is one of those things you didn't know would be a deal breaker until you experienced it. It sounds even more horrible, but I've discouraged him from visiting me more than just the weekends because I know if he stays over I won't sleep and it will ruin the rest of my week (more than it already was from the weekend) - and my top love language is time spent!"
Drugs,fa9vxld,t3_e41mpe,1575894083.0,"I would say what you're experiencing goes beyond munchies - is it possible you're coping with depression through smoking and eating? If so, I would go for the appetite suppressants (phentermine) to help get your patterns back to normal. I've smoked daily on phentermine and had no urge to binge, but I did have more self-esteem and confidence once some of the binge weight came off to get out and see friends and work on my depression..."

Because of my height, no one takes me seriously when I say I've gained weight or I'm eating too much, etc. because it does spread differently. I have BED and literal uncontrollable cravings are all I know, but I've taken phentermine and now I'm on Contrave - they both work very well to shift your thoughts away from food, which helps a lot with over eating and binging. If intrusive food thoughts are your issue, this is your drug.

Also, Contrave has a coupon on their site you can sign up for - it made the cost go from over $300 to $50 at the pharmacy..."
overcomebingeeating,f9qezzm,t3_con8b6,1575560045.0,"I just wanted to share my thoughts somewhere concerning the public's concern/studies on weight loss drugs such as Contrave or Phentermine, which is that these drugs aren't ""miracle drugs"" and the pounds will not just melt off. They're right! BUT, these studies do not consider the weight that would have been put on if the medication hadn't been prescribed. No one talks about the weight these patients have PREVENTED by beginning medication because, maintaining your weight when you're addicted to food is nearly impossible. That's all I wanted to say, everything else is extra:

Myself, I've tried phentermine on three occasions, as you're only allowed a short amount of time on it. Every time, I loved it. I didn't have the urge to eat healthier, but then again, I didn't have the urge to eat at all. It's not a miracle drug - if you aren't working out or creating more movement in your lifestyle, then you'll likely not lose much weight, *but* you won't gain any either! You could continue to eat the same foods, just much less of it, and not gain weight. The intention of this drug is for patients to curve their cravings whilst learning new, better food habits (i.e. more vegetables and less carbs). It can be difficult to do because with the medication you are literally never thinking about food, so premeditated meals have to be *intentional* in order to create new habits*.* Another psychological side effect of Phentermine is the confidence it brings! When you're not obsessing about food, you're not obsessing about your weight, so the confidence that brings is worth the price alone. After stopping phentermine, I notice that those feelings and the consistency of not eating at night stays with me for a month or two (in between naps because of the total energy zap stopping phentermine will cause). But in the past month I noticed myself eating more, having late night cravings, and then I started to binge again. That's when I made an appointment to find a medication alternative to try for more long-term help.

Since stopping phentermine in September, I've gained about 15 lbs and have recently started Contrave. I'm only in my third week and at first I honestly was still late night binging and I wasn't feeling the lack of urge that phentermine had brought easily after the first dose. But, this week I'm up to 2 pills in the morning and 1 at night and I can tell that it's taking effect. I have more energy (I've been awake after 6 hours of sleep) and my anxious food and body concerns are gone. I've also been able to *not* eat everything in my apartment this week, which those of you who are addicted to food or are chronic bingers, is HUGE.

A little background (since I'm telling all), I've been a binge eater for as long as I can remember. I didn't have a name for it when I was sneaking spoonfuls of sugar as a child, or when I was eating entire pints of ice cream and then some in high school, or even in college when I was stealing roommate's sweets to scratch my itch. After college, when I was stuffing myself so full of food that I was literally in pain (as I'm sure many of you have experienced) again and again, and feeling so out of control and ashamed. I struggled with this for a long time, distracting myself in the evenings as much as possible so that the urge wouldn't creep up daily.

All that to say, I know what it feels like to feel out of control and helpless to your addiction to food and stuffing yourself. It's a feeling that finds you and you don't know when it's going to leave. The relief I felt when I took phentermine and those feelings didn't find me again was beyond amazing, almost *miraculous*. I felt so normal, is this how everyone feels about food? They feel full and don't still order dessert? It's amazing, I honestly cannot describe this ease of eating like a normal person with literally no effort. That's why when my inability to not binge reappeared, I sought an alternative medication that would help me psychologically."
