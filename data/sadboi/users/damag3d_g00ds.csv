Even more shameful because this was my response to my own marriage having imploded because I was cheated on. I feel horrible. She was an old flame from high school, but I was sad and lonely, and I guess mad too. I knew it was wrong but I led her astray and did it anyway. She was not happy in her marriage, but that's no excuse.  I broke it off because it turned out not to make me any happier and only feel worse.  I had to cut off contact, but I hope she was able to work it out with her husband. I don't know if he ever even found out, but when I broke it off, I told her that's what I wanted, for her to cut it out with me and to try to make it work with him.  Honestly, it's probably one of the, if not THE shittiest thing(s) I have ever done. 1/10, would not recommend or do again.

Edit, some info just in case and before anyone asks - Yes, she was married, and not separated or anything.  She had two kids with guy, and they had been married for almost 20 years or thereabouts.  

My own marriage had fallen apart after 20 years and 3 kids. So, maybe it was a weird way to get back at my ex, or it was me just pissing on the concept of marriage because I was so hurt and upset, and just so angry, at everything and everyone.

I also never cheated,  and she was the center of my universe.  But once she got tired of always having to validate me and be my cheerleader, and decided to move on, I let her have it.   I realize now the only reason we lasted as long as we did is because she chose to put up with or ignore my bull crap.  So if you want to call that enabling, whatever. 

I know how how lot of us love, pedal to metal, nothing held back.  You have to admit and realize it's a pretty mixed bag, man. I understand how we can burn people out.

It's been worse since the lock down.  What a horrible time.  It is nightmare for ""normal"" people, for us, it's almost torture.

I think fear of dying and or losing someone I love is freaking me out, not to mention it's has just upped the loneliness by a factor of 5, and it's just not the most ideal or even tolerable of situations for a sufferer.  

I hope the new meds work for you, good luck!"
BPD,fmdymvp,t3_fumvgd,1585982421.0,"I am so sorry.  I can't imagine.  I am hetero middle aged male (although I was bi-curious in my teens and early 20s), so actually I can imagine.  After a girl/woman would hurt me, for a while I'd jump the fence and try with a cute guy, but that would never end well, either.

Since I was definitely more on the straight side, I went for a girl, who ironically had just gotten out of a 5 year same-sex, abusive relationship, and actually identified as lesbian back then.  I remembered becoming friends with her and thinking she was just so cool, and being really upset that she didn't like guys.  We stared hanging out and she soon discovered that SHE was in fact bisexual.  We got married less than 2 years after our first kiss, and had the first of 3 kids within 3 years of marriage.  

Anyway, fast forward to almost 20 years of marriage, just a few months shy, and she tells me she wants out. I did manage to keep her around sort of and even got her to try half ass to fix it, but about 6, almost 7 months later I left the house I bought for us and the kids, and I've been a wreck ever since (4 years).   

The point I am trying to make is that you are young, and you still should have hope, but it's also a warning, that just because you think you have found the one, if you don't work on it and one or both of you have issues, it can still come crashing down, so be careful what you wish for, you might just get it.

God, I really didn't want to this to be so negative, but that's how it came out.  I really meant to tell you there is time yet for you.  I just really want to emphasize that once you find love, don't ever take it for granted, not for one moment.  Love is rare and hard for everyone, but for those of us with this condition, it's pretty damn near impossible.  I am grateful for having someone that long, even though the last few years were noticeably in decline, well noticeable to everyone but me, that is. Still I do believe it is better to have loved and lost than to have never have loved at all.  

So, I wish you love and happiness, young stranger, because every human deserves it."

BPD,flw6dxi,t3_fr68tu,1585540873.0,"Oh man.  I am a sufferer of BPD, btw, it's not pc to refer to someone as a ""borderline"".  After a 20 year, 3 kid marriage, I got divorced from my wife.  It's really complicated for me.  I understand I pushed her away.  You have to be true to your own values, and if you love him and want to try, then by all means do so, but you have to insist the be in therapy too, you both need individual (glad you're getting it) and it seems like he is too, but also you should do couple's therapy.  Be real about boundaries and consequences, and remember I'm the BPD sufferer here, but follow your heart.  Good luck.  I really can't speak about sociopathy or ASPD as I don't have these, but I do just have to say, it really complicates matters.  It doesn't change my overall advice, but I just feel the need to point that out should you consider my advice.  Trying to be honest here.  I do hope the best for both of you. Good luck."
BPD,flw5u7h,t3_fr8vcc,1585540451.0,"So I want to say right off the bat, I **DO** have an official BPD diagnosis, from a psychiatrist, not a psychologist or therapist or anything else, although as you'll see they pitched in.  

I had for years been operating under the misdiagnosis of Bipolar Disorder, but it just didn't feel right to me and I felt I wasn't making progress. So after years of suffering and a major life event, my divorce, I decided to go back for a second opinion.  Just so you know, and because it's relevant to your situation, the first doctor to see me and who gave me the incorrect Bipolar diag only got a snapshot of me and didn't see me for very long.  Therefore, it's my belief that because of that along with the general opinion back in the day (1980s) that BPD was either female only or at least super rare in males, he got it wrong, and I *suffered* because of it.  

This last time this new doctor saw me many times and had psychologists and therapists confer, compare and contrast notes before I finally got my official diagnosis which includes: Major Depressive Disorder, General Anxiety Disorder, and of course, now Borderline Personality Disorder. I also have a touch of OCD, but that's just traits/tendencies that have flared up or disappeared but have never been more than an annoyance or really permanent in nature.  

Anyway, getting off topic as usual.  My point is, now that I know exactly what I have and even though I have been in therapy on and off for years, I feel like I'm finally gaining traction on my conditions, because how can you fix something if you don't know it's broken?  

That's my bottom-line take away for you.   How can you ever expect to get better/well if you don't know exactly what's wrong with you? Have courage, be honest with both yourself and your provider(s) and get the help you need and deserve.  Good luck."
BPD,flw3mgu,t3_fr430d,1585538784.0,"Standard operating procedure.  I try to overcompensate for my apparent (at least to me) lack of worth by spending on that person.  I have stopped now for two reasons, my FP and I are in a weird place and I'm broke."
BPD,flw3fu6,t3_frc9lr,1585538649.0,"Absolutely agree, now the whole world is in survival mode and not just me. In weird way, for me as a sufferer it's business as usual, and maybe even somewhat of a break from having to deal with other people.  5 minutes later I will feel lonelier than ever.  Like I said, business as usual."
