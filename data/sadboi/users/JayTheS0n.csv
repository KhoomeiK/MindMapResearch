SkincareAddiction,fpnjy5j,t1_fpmuefb,1588765318.0,"the ordinary AHA & BHA peel -
I really thought this stuff would burn my face off since i’m not too experienced with chemical exfoliants, but it really wasn’t too bad for my first time. it instantly cleared up pores and gave me a brighter complexion.

the ordinary Hyaluronic Acid serum -
I layer this under my ceraVe moisturizers and it is really great! It really hydrates my skin and soothes any irritation I have. 

I plan to get TO niacinamide 10% serum as well.

I think TO is pretty worth it. I’d suggest only getting it if you have a good foundation down. There’s a reason why this stuff is everywhere in the skincare community, they have really amazing products!"

He told me last night to take the picture while i was asleep. So I only really knew my Aunt was making this slideshow when i woke up this morning around 10. I held off for so long to tell him i’m uncomfortable taking a picture of myself because of a lot of problems we’ve had, which i won’t get into detail. I’ve been planning to make her a painting anyways and i just thought not being in the slideshow wouldn’t be a big deal. I don’t really feel like i’m apart of that family since I live with my mom. I’ve had issues with socializing and rarely say anything to that part of my family, not because I don’t want to but because I physically cannot. So i don’t blame them for acting distant because I know my anxiety can look like i’m being cold and uninterested. 

I definitely realize now that I could have done some things differently and should have talked to my dad right as I saw his text.

I hope this doesn’t sound like I’m blaming everything on my feelings and anxiety, but I feel as though mentioning these things are important for people to know exactly what’s going on."

She didn’t grow up in a very good environment. She lived in a drug trailer and there were constantly drug deals going on. Whenever I would spend the night at her trailer house her dad just stayed in the back room and pretended like he didn’t see his kids doing drugs/tobacco. Her mom previously died from a drinking problem. The trailer was an absolute mess. Their two pugs were extremely obese and dehydrated. Only my sister would remember to give them water and most of the time she wasn’t there. There was mold inside the toilet and all over the bathroom. There was even mold in the corners of the house. There was broken glass and razor blades everywhere. Everyone who lived there and came over to that house was an absolute wreck of a drug addict. They were nice people too. She had parents that loved her, but loved drugs and money more, so she grew up neglected. Her father passed away due to meth use and other underlying problems. He was disabled and didn’t work. She ran away to her boyfriends house and we went looking for her. When we found her we took her in. My mom had temporary guardianship over her. Everyone had a hard time adjusting,especially my sister. She was going through a rough time in her life so she turned to even more drugs. It took a while but eventually we were able to get her the help she needed. Recently we legally adopted her and we consider her 100% part of the family. It’s only me her and my mom living here and we are a happy small family. There are still rough patches for sure and we still have bad days, but we are always here for each other.

WhatsWrongWithYourCat,fg36hlj,t3_ewj13v,1580472265.0,"hello! i’m coming here to educate you a little on fish keeping! this size of a tank is too small for ANY fish let alone this size of a fish. it looks to be about two to three inches. keeping fish in a small bowl like this is not only abusive and cramped for the fish, but also dangerous. it’s very easy for toxic ammonia and and nitrate levels to rise very suddenly and kill your fish. this is also not very good for your cat and your cat can be putting even more harmful bacteria into this small bowl of water. i wouldn’t HIGHLY suggest at least a 10 gallon tank with a filter for this fish, but 20 gallons would be the best option. you can give the fish away to a local fish store if all of this sounds like too much money and work for you. if you really want to get into fish keeping, get a five gallon tank with a filter and heater set to 78 degrees. let the tank cycle by putting a small pinch of food in the tank and let it cycle for a month. there are youtube videos and articles all about cycling your tank. then you can get some plants for your fish to hide in. a betta fish is the best beginner fish in my opinion. it only requires a five gallon tank and likes to be alone. please read up in fish keeping. your fish is miserable. i don’t mean to sound rude but i am very passionate about fish. remember that they are animals and NOT decorations!"

feminineboys,ffybsyi,t3_evsgcx,1580342689.0,"totally valid. took me forever to accept myself as a feminine trans guy. i’ve been on t for 2 years now and i still get misgendered unfortunately ): 
even when i dress masculine i get misgendered constantly and being feminine makes me feel uncomfortable and weird. but i love being feminine and doing feminine things. i’ve come to realize that the only reason i’m uncomfortable with being feminine is because of what other people think of me. and although that is a huge part of being trans (being gendered correctly) it took me a long time to realize that what really matters is that i think i look like a boy and i like what i’m wearing. 

for me either i have to wear masculine clothes, probably still get misgendered, and feel not cute wearing masculine clothes OR wear feminine clothes, probably get misgendered and just tell myself it’s probably because i have long hair and tight clothes, and feel cute in what i’m wearing.

so for me i weigh out the pros and cons of wearing masculine clothes vs feminine clothes. feminine clothes might seem like the best option for one day and masculine clothes another day. i just do what makes me feel the most comfortable for THAT day. everyday is different for me.

as for feeling invalid, i understand. when i first tried to start dressing more feminine about a year on t everyone kept telling me i should cut my hair, lift weights to get more bulky, get a suit, stop wearing pink, etc. but i slowly started wearing more and more feminine clothes and eventually people realized that i like being feminine and they aren’t going to change my style. 

i didn’t really have much of a problem with dysphoria up until puberty. i barely even thought about gender. i was super feminine growing up so it surprised my parents quite a bit that i was trans, but it definitely explained some things. puberty was awful and i was utterly confused because i liked being feminine and i loved perfume and cute things but i desperately wanted to stop being a girl, but i thought i would have to give up everything feminine in order to be a guy so i just chose to be gender fluid at the age of 12. i was so confused and i thought i was a lesbian. totally wrong btw, i’m a gay man haha. but i used being a lesbian to make myself more masculine while still being a girl. i realized that was also wrong around 13. 

i tried to make myself a super masculine guy and i was starting to feel a little more comfortable. but i was so jealous of girls and how pretty they looked and how they get to wear cute things and now i can’t. but then it suddenly hit me that it really doesn’t matter what i wear. i’m still a guy, i still identify as a guy. so i wore clothes that i liked and people actually complimented me! and i live in in a very tradition conservative state. right now i’m at a point where i could walk into a guys restroom or a girls restroom and people might take a double take but then they think i’m supposed to be there. i certainly would never use a public restroom though.

i hope this makes you feel a little more. valid, i know how it feels to doubt yourself and it’s not fun ):
have a wonderful life and just do what makes you happy and comfortable! <3"

selfharm,fdkg1b9,t1_fdkeskr,1578503096.0,"aha, i’ve had a look at your account. you said you were lonely in one post. i’m lonely too dude, that’s how i started cutting. also, in another post when you posted to r/teenagers it seems like you’re having trouble with your self image. these exact problems is what really lead me to keep cutting. it looks like you might have anxiety as well. i hope none of this sounds rude, i have these exact same problems. cutting makes me feel super isolated and even more lonely, but again,  i can’t stop, it feels good. trying to stop the best i can though!i’m 15 too, turning 16 in february. feel free to pm me anytime about any questions or if you’re getting urges, i can do my best to distract you from those urges. you can also just pm me and we can be friends!"
selfharm,fdkeskr,t3_elma32,1578502341.0,"please please please don’t try it again. i know that cutting can really pull you in and make you want to do it again even the first time. i thought it wasn’t a big deal the first time i started cutting, but now i have gross puffy scars everywhere. piled on top of each other, i’d say about 25% of my body is covered with scars, which is more than you would think. i hate that whenever i have an itch on my thigh that it feels like a fucking washboard when i scratch it. i hate that i’m not smooth, but most of all i hate that i’ve run out of room on the places i like to cut, which just shows how this addiction can take ahold of you life. i thought i’d just do a few cuts, but it just wasn’t enough and it still isn’t enough. i didn’t listen to anyone advice not to cut and i desperately wish i would have listened. maybe i would’ve spent the time cutting on healthy coping skills if i never started. you don’t really have to have a reason to cut. the first time i started cutting i felt as though i wasn’t getting any attention and i used cutting to fill the void. when i felt lonely i always thought at least i have these cuts. i can’t explain why it’s comforting to have them, but it is. fresh cuts feel good and warm, but scars are just big gross bumps that i don’t want. cutting over scars feels terrible as well. it takes so long to heal and after it heals now all i have is another scar and i’m just adding to the gross pile, and so i do it again, and again and again. i’ve been three weeks clean so far, but i struggle with it everyday. i can’t seem to go more than 5 months without it. so please, don’t cut again. you don’t want to be caught in the loop. it’s not fun, you don’t get good attention, and people look at you like you’re broken. tell someone you’re having these thoughts. it’s likely that maybe you’re lonely or you don’t feel like you’re getting attention (NOT a bad thing). seeking attention is absolutely a valid reason to cut, but you want to avoid it if you can. most people aren’t THIS interested in cutting, and this is kinda how it starts. you might genuinely be cutting just because you’re curious, but that’s usually not the case. you might be convincing yourself that this is what you’re doing and that’s all. it’s a confusing spiral and i wouldn’t wish it on anyone."
AskReddit,fdit36u,t3_elgpmo,1578450427.0,"i would like it if mental hospitals were better. i have been involuntarily admitted to the mental hospital after i opened up. the best mental hospital i’ve been to was in utah, which makes sense since their suicide rates are really high. i think the whole system is fucked with how they treat people with mental illnesses or suicidal ideation. there needs to be better resources for people who can’t afford to put themselves in a program. i wish insurances would cover more when it comes to mental health issues. 

so, i think this checkup would be pretty pointless for some people because they would feel like they have to lie and say they’re fine. others it might be great for them. everyone’s mental health experience is different."
feminineboys,fdisgla,t1_fdiqmxh,1578450028.0,"also! if you don’t have any exfoliation cream a loofa works just fine. you can even use a rag and some soap. no need to scrub super hard either. just put a bit of pressure and a rag or loofa should do just fine!!! exfoliating cream is wonderful though haha. conditioner actually works amazing as a moisturizer cream for legs (don’t use on face). i recommend to anyone coconut oil and conditioner for shaving. it’s a very close shave and make you feel super soft. i basically use coconut oil or rose oil everywhere on my body for moisturizer (just not my face bc acne). it’s kinda a gross feeling at first because you have to let it sit for like 5 minutes and then rub it in the best you can and then take off the excess oil. but ahh it makes me feel so soft. i love laying in bed with soft blankets with some cute underwear on so i can feel pretty. find what works best for you, everyone is different! that’s just what works best for me (:"
MaladaptiveDreaming,fc0y3rk,t1_fbkbhie,1577302815.0,"ah yeah. i know. distracting is HARRRDDD. just trying to stop daydreaming is so so so hard. i can’t go a day without it if i’m being honest. i just wish there was more help out there. i think i might try to get on medication. i absolutely despise medication  and pills, but honestly i hate daydreaming even more, but like, i love it at the same time. i don’t want to give it up. it’s all i have. also, i hope you don’t mind i looked at your account. i’m transgender too, ftm. i think it helps a lot with dysphoria. you can literally be anything you want in your daydreams. it’s fucking hard dude. life is hard and daydreaming is easy and fun. i get all the emotions from daydreaming, i feel nothing in real life except for despair. if you’re not seeing a therapist, i really really really suggest it. hope you’re doing well💕"
MaladaptiveDreaming,fbjzwbg,t3_edq14n,1576942666.0,"personally, i don’t think anyone should be daydreaming for more than 2 hours a day. the thing about maladaptive daydreaming is that on average you spend 4 hours a day just daydreaming. i certainly do it way more. but, it is a problem. everyone here seems to think that it’s not a problem. it’s an addiction. if it’s getting in the way of your everyday life, it shouldn’t continue. everyone daydreams, its a normal thing. but daydreaming hours on end to the point where the only happiness you get is from daydreaming is a serious problem. unfortunately it’s reallllyyy hard to stop. it’s not a physical thing that you can lock away and have people make sure you don’t do it. it requires a LOT of will power.
one thing that will come in very useful is to distract distract distract. keep tying to do new things, find anything else (healthy) that makes you feel even just a smidge if happiness. keep doing it and keep finding new things. try listening to podcasts to distract yourself, read books, clean, watch movies. you can do a lot to treat yourself in the real world. maladaptive daydreaming is still not very researched, like at all. we need to figure out coping skills and treatment to stop this addiction.
i desperately wish i didn’t daydream. i daydream only about an ideal life and self. i spend all my time everyday just daydreaming. this is a serious addiction and people really need to start seeing it for the way it is. if you daydream maybe 2-3 hours everyday, then okay, that’s not too bad. but 4+ hours on end is super unhealthy."
MaladaptiveDreaming,f9onwp5,t1_f9ofqip,1575509200.0,"for me i just like voices in the background. since i have constant stimulation from daydreaming, silence is the worst sound.  i don’t really listen to the conversation unless something really interesting pops up, but just listening to voices as back round noise is nice.  helps a bit with loneliness, too."
MaladaptiveDreaming,f90egn4,t3_e2tih4,1574971232.0,"ocd can definitely contribute to this addiction. it’s an obsession to daydreaming. unfortunately there is not a lot of research on this disorder and isn’t even in the dsm. i think it’s important to spread the word on this disorder so we can have more tools and better coping mechanisms so we don’t have to struggle alone. i only just found out about maladaptive daydreaming today, and realized i’ve probably daydreamed for about a fourth of my life and that i really need help. i can’t believe i haven’t made this connection before, but my grades started going down ever since i started excessively daydreaming."
WomensHealth,f8zjhxo,t1_f8wv7nc,1574961537.0,"it smells like nothing, there is no irritation/itchiness whatsoever, and the consistency is like normal discharge, maybe a little more mucus-like. the only symptom i have is the color is off and penetration is a bit painful, but penetration has always been painful for me. the more rough i am down there the darker and more discharge there is. I don’t think the darkness is because of vaginal bleeding. the testosterone should only be causing some dryness a bit of irritation, but nothing about green discharge. but, medically anything possible i suppose."
boomershumor,f2x59h0,t1_f2uz8hm,1570473923.0,"it’s not transphobic to simply say “hey i’m not into trans people, sorry”. this is coming from a trans person. what is transphobic would be to say “ew you’re trans? that’s fucking nasty, i don’t wanna sleep with a hermaphrodite, fucking tranny”. there are nice ways to turn a trans person down. i do understand some trans people will think you’re transphobic either way, in that case, it’s best you’re not sleeping with them. if you’re trans and you know you are going to sleep with them, you have to tell them you’re trans beforehand. i suggest doing this part in a public place and don’t wait until you go home with them."

rant,ewkdkol,t1_ewiuv64,1565481638.0,"oh i was replying to OhDeerLordMan. i agree with you 100%. just because you may have it a little harder does not mean you are entitled to acting like an asshole. whenever i’m being manipulative or anything, sure i’ll be like “i have bpd so i may be a little more manipulative than most, but i will work on that the best i can.” then i’ll have them tell me whenever i’m acting toxic so that way i can reflect and fix my behavior."
rant,ewitcbk,t1_ewilg66,1565456353.0,"i have borderline personality disorder and it in no way makes you a horrible person. i know many other amazing people with bpd. sure i do have slip ups once in a while, but i’m working on it the best i can. i’m in therapy so i can recognize when i’m hurting someone and i’m doing pretty well with recognizing my manipulation. please be mindful of what you’re saying. it’s extremely hurtful to be called a horrible person and someone you should avoid at all costs when i’m constantly obsessing over what to say to someone and if it can hurt their feelings. i do admit though, many people with bpd may not want help which may be why you feel this way about us."
acne,eu5k0j9,t1_eu3kujs,1563479199.0,"Well i prefer not to get an iud mostly because I’m extremely dysphoric. i get physically pain when thinking of me having a uterus, which i know is really weird but that’s just how dysphoria is. i hate having pelvic exams already and I usually do anything i can to get out of it. I think it’s really dumb because I am extremely unlikely to get pregnant and I also plan to go on lupron which is a birth control, but since it’s not an option you can click on the computer, it doesn’t count. This whole experience is just really frustrating, I just wanted to see if there was anything else at all to help me get rid of my acne, but since everyone here is also saying accutane might be best, I think i’ll give it a try. I might try and talk to my doctor and see if there’s anything she can give me as a different form of birth control."
acne,eu3cjo2,t3_celfp4,1563411080.0,"A little information; I am female to male transgender, currently taking testosterone injections and have been on testosterone for 1 and 1/2 years. I am 15 years old and had acne since 9 and it has progressively been getting worse over the years. My dermatologist who I never met kinda just walked in and didn’t really inspect my face? (i don’t know exactly what they do at a dermatologist appointment but i assumed she would take a closer look at my face). She told me accutane would probably be best for me. Her nurse was passive aggressive about me being transgender? I kind of had a horrible experience, but I do want to take accutane into consideration. My face is really really sensitive and dry, but also gets oily because of how dry it is. I was told I have to go on two forms of birth control and those two don’t include lupron, which would be the absolute best option for me. I can’t go on hormonal because of the testosterone. The only option left would be the one they stick in your uterus. That is absolutely NOT an option for me. There is no way I’m doing that. She said I can try and different antibiotic, but i’ve already been on soooo many. I think because of the bad experience I don’t really want to go back and say yes to accutane. does anyone have any other ideas?"

SelfHarmScars,eoplegv,t3_bslvw1,1558767833.0,"i’m a babysitter and at first i had no idea what to say when kids would ask me about my scars, but now i usually just tell them a tiger attacked me. if they are old enough to know i’m lying i usually just say ‘maybe you should ask mommy’. i always try my best to warn the parents first about the scars and have them come up with a plan with me about what i should say. 

you handled it pretty well. some kids are gonna think the scars are cool. to be fair scars can be kinda badass, but self harm scars are a little different and kids don’t know any better. i’d suggest talking with your brother and coming up with a plan that he’s comfortable with so that way you don’t feel like you’re parenting someone else’s child. 

just know living in the present is best for these kind of situations. it’s easy to worry and think that you could be the possible cause for their self harm in the future. your niece will be curious and will ask questions and occasionally make comments. there’s nothing you can do to stop it and you won’t always be prepared for what she will say and that’s okay. the best thing you can do is not make a big deal about the scars and be like ‘yeah i have them, it’s not that special’ and she will most likely grow up and think some people just have scars that look like that. 

i wish you and your niece the best in life 💕"
