It's gotten me through a lot of rough nights. Your experiences sound similar to mine. It's good to know there are others out there who also do this.

Stay safe, and sweet dreams!"
BipolarReddit,fqd0swb,t3_gi3405,1589275680.0,"Yes! I've always had disturbing nightmares and various sleep problems. The dream within a dream ones get me pretty messed up. Ever since I was a kid I've had a recurring nightmare where I wake up, and I'm sitting in bed, only to realize I'm still in the dream, and have to fight to wake up again. It's always a terrifying few moments, recognizing that I'm asleep but cannot force my body to wake up. And then once I really am awake I always second guess reality. 

I have bipolar 2 (with very low lows), generalized anxiety disorder, and insomnia. I try to write my dreams down when I remember them, which isn't as often anymore due to lamictal, mirtazapine, and probably the gabapentin I take for nerve pain, but it's hard to say honestly. I need to figure out for sure which meds tend to make me remember dreams and which make me forget. I sometimes wish I could remember them all; sometimes it's like I have another, more awesome life in my Dreamland! Not usually though, especially recently, they've been pretty dark. Still, dreams in general fascinate me.

Anyway I hope you're staying safe and have sweet dreams whenever you next sleep!"

I don't really need anything right now, but I did start drawing again recently, and plan to get back in to watercolors.

I can't tell you how close to home this hit. Growing up, and especially as a teenager, we wished we could somehow record my dad when he blew up like this. (Smart phones weren't a thing back then and video cameras were expensive.) Bipolar disorder runs in my family so we're pretty sure that's what was happening, although I've had therapists mention narcissism. He refuses to go to a therapist or psychiatrist himself. If he'd seen himself back then, he would have probably reacted the same way your dad did. They don't realize how bad they really get. Keep recording him if/when this happens again. Keep showing him. And most importantly, talk to him about getting psychiatric help. It could change his life and yours for the better. Good luck to you, OP, stay strong."

She bought a book, but I couldn't afford one so I brought an old Polaroid I had of myself wearing a Kiss shirt. (Thinking back, I don't know why I didn't just bring the ticket stub.) We got to the front of the line and his associate told me I wouldn't be able to meet him because I didn't buy a book. ""Oh well,"" I thought, as I pushed my friend towards him and turned to walk away.

Suddenly I hear, ""Hey, where ya going, miss?"" Gene Simmons himself waved me over, apologized, and signed my Polaroid. He put his arms around my friend and me so we could get a photo of us all sticking our tongues out, in typical Gene Simmons fashion. We chatted briefly about high school, him telling us that if we had boyfriends they'd better be treating us well. He even offered us some brownies one of the other fans had brought for him.

He's a genuinely nice guy, and very intelligent. I remember thinking, especially since he wasn't in make-up at the time, ""this is just a normal, kind gentleman."""

Also, you were talking about it being hard to believe someone could be so genuinely kind.. I totally feel that and I expect the worst most of the time.

Sometimes it amazes me how chill he is; I never thought a person could be so accepting of me, flaws and all.

Would forcing people to include their preferred gender pronouns in company emails be considered treating them with dignity and respect? No, and it wouldn't be legal to do so either."
AmItheAsshole,fk0d2wd,t1_fk09a75,1583752788.0,"I don't think OP is pressuring anyone to not reveal pronouns. It seems like his follow-up email was just clarifying that, while some people may choose to reveal their pronouns of their own volition, it is not company policy or in any way necessary to do so. When people first read the women's emails they might have assumed it was becoming a new company policy, and OP doesn't want anyone thinking that way because it would be illegal to force employees to reveal preferred gender pronouns."
