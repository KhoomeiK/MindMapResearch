SuicideWatch,es73763,t3_c69d9q,1561662951.0,"I don't think people in general think you are hurting feminism. You have your own struggle, and you are yourself, that's not hurting anyone in and of itself. It is what it is, but you're not hurting feminism, it seems like your idea of feminism is hurting you.

I'd say feminism means that women should be able to be as fucked up as men, and you have the right to be you just like everybody else."
SuicideWatch,es6xcx0,t3_c5zms0,1561659381.0,"I've done it over and over again before, deleting my Facebook account and isolating myself, but it doesn't help. It's hard to realize when you're deep into self hate and suicidal thoughts, but hopefully you'll get better and realize that you need other people, and you always have. But yeah, when it gets really dark it's hard to justify dragging other people down with you :("
SuicideWatch,ercfkbp,t1_ercerh5,1560710815.0,"Yeah, that's pretty much what I did afterwards, trying to apologize as if it was the worst thing ever. Well, I guess it is what it is, but I'm getting so tired of my brain. I need to stop thinking about this, but I just can't."
SuicideWatch,erceocs,t1_ercdxm9,1560710141.0,"It's just so fucking hard right now, being hated and knowing that it's all completely my own fault. I keep hoping that she'll forgive me, but that's just selfish. I don't deserve that. I'm shit. I've tried to keep myself occupied over the years, but it just doesn't work anymore. My brain is completely locked in on the worst thing I have ever done. This is no way to live. I can't get over it, and I don't know if I can continue with this struggle. It's becoming pointless."
