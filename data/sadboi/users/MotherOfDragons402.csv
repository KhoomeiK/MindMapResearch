The HRBPs are somewhat involved in the process, but it’s mostly us working with our immigration attorney, TA, and the hiring manager."
humanresources,f39t6dw,t1_f399s96,1570755238.0,"You need to keep the scans of the photo ID documents presented if you are an E-verify employer:

If you participate in E-Verify and the employee presents a document used as part of Photo Matching, currently the U.S. passport and passport card, Permanent Resident Card (Form I-551) and the Employment Authorization Document (Form I-766), you must retain a photocopy of the document he or she presents. Other documents may be added to Photo Matching in the future. If you do not participate in E-Verify, you are not required to make photo copies of documents. However, if you wish to make photocopies of documents other than those used in E-Verify, you must do so for all employees. Photocopies must not be used for any other purpose. Photocopying documents does not relieve you of your obligation to fully complete Section 2 of Form I-9, nor is it an acceptable substitute for proper completion of Form I-9 in general.

AskReddit,er79po6,t3_c0qaj7,1560571758.0,"Yes! I work in HR and was so overworked, over my 4 hour a day commute, treated like I didn’t know anything (lowest ranking person on my team but with 10 years of experience), and my team members made me cry and bullied me (grown women mind you).  I was stressed, overwhelmed, my depression and anxiety were at an all time high and I wasn’t even remotely happy or fulfilled.  My amazing fiancé supported me finally giving in to what I needed to become a healthy and sane person again.  I packed up my desk and the next day working from my other office location, told my boss I was leaving end of the day.  I packed my other desk, closed up shop and went home.

I spent 3 months off work for the first time in 15 years.  And at first it was a mix of glorious and crappy.  But I slowly remembered who I was again before the work drama took hold.  I went to therapy, did things for me, and worked on finding the right job for me.  It’s been 3 months at my new job and I just got a bonus for kicking ass, I’ve been training a new team member so we can share the workload, and best of all, I’m me again.  It was the scariest thing I’ve ever done, but I’m so glad I did it."

I agree that you should speak with someone higher in HR and check your company’s handbook if they have one to review the leave policies."

Similar situation after my fiancé told his family.  It’s been years and he still gets misgendered and deadnamed by his mom.  Other times, she calls him her son.  Took her some time but she’s been better with it.  

When he first came out to them I asked him what he wanted me to call him around them.  His response was that it’s going to be weird for them, but to call him by his new name and pronouns.  And it was weird.  But eventually, they saw that now 2 people were using the correct pronouns and his correct name and it started to get easier.  It was a bit of exposure therapy."
