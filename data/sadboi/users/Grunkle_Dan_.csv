pcgaming,eq65wy7,t3_bwymu8,1559822675.0,"Personally I think there is room for politics in gaming. Especially when this is obviously going to be a heavily fictionalized version of events only loosely based on actual events.

However despite this I doubt Ubisoft are gonna try and say anything with this premise and it will likely be incredibly hollow just like Far Cry 5 is."
