Enneagram,fqx7xyt,t1_fqvxy5q,1589727762.0,and the whole point of my post was that it‚Äôs a lazy stereotype
Enneagram,fqx7to6,t1_fqwyr2l,1589727695.0,"writers don‚Äôt look at the enneagram and base their characters on one type. static villains aren‚Äôt ‚Äúwritten‚Äù as eights, they‚Äôre written as static.

are you an 8? i doubt you are. the entire point of my post was that every type is capable of exhibiting those qualities with their unique intentions. villains are just as likely to be any other type, YOU are the lazy one for filing them under 8 because you think only 8 = powerhungry"
Enneagram8,fqv1ex2,t3_gkoh6u,1589667944.0,"i was extremely malnourished in 2018. at the hospital they said they worried i had an eating disorder and refused to give a release date or release me without me agreeing to rehab. 
i was hospitalized with someone watching me 24/7 for over a month, and then sent to a rehab for two months. 

at the rehab they had really stringent rules and i had limited communication with my family which was also really difficult. i went a little batshit in there. not being able to leave, or to know when the nightmare was going to be over was extremely difficult for me, and i fell into very dissociative and combative patterns. 

why was i malnourished to begin with? i was diagnosed with a rare eating disorder (ARFID), and it causes me to either not feel hunger at all, or to feel very extreme nausea in situations of stress (or for me, loss of control). so it‚Äôs really interesting to me that you mentioned the gut reaction! that is 100% my experience. 

i still struggle with it but gets easier every day! i learned about the enneagram in the rehab center and by far it has been my greatest tool in becoming a better me."

I definitely do see a correlation between the types :)"

Enneagram,fp0pxd2,t3_gan4or,1588214343.0,"the best way to know your type is with good research! tests try to pin it down, but it can be challenging. read about each of the types at the enneagram institute website. read the core sins, core values, core fears, and core desires of every type and one might jump out to you! these tests can be super hard to read though. 

also, type 9‚Äôs are kind of the rainbow of the enneagram. more than any other type, they are mistyped because they have some traits from every enneagram. that may be why your results are so varied! good luck!"

Enneagram,fp061q2,t1_fp04e2d,1588203157.0,currently I‚Äôm working on not picking fights with new friends in order to test their approach to confrontation in order to see if I can trust them (logic where?????) so I definitely agree lol
Enneagram8,fp05v22,t1_fp03qfy,1588203058.0,"yeah, we‚Äôre still in contact and actually pretty good friends (it‚Äôs definitely a superficial, very tense friendship, but we have all the same interests and mutual friends so we stayed friends). sometimes i really miss being close with her, but every time i‚Äôm with her i remember why we didn‚Äôt work out. even though we have so much fun together, we definitely bring out some of the worst in each other."

i think it‚Äôs a bit striking for the big bad wolf of the enneagram, but i feel like in a lot of ways, type 8‚Äôs are toddlers wearing a full set of silver knight armor. in between fits of rage and passion and vengeance, i‚Äôm always aware of a painfully strong sense of empathy, that makes me feel like a terrified little kid."
Enneagram8,fp00off,t3_ga7sia,1588200288.0,"my ex was a 4 and i‚Äôm still obsessed with her hipster ass... definitely a dangerous combination. we were competitive and aggressive with each other. always trying to outdo each other with who is the smartest, or friendliest, or sexiest. maybe that‚Äôs more so because we‚Äôre lesbians, we were friends first and and girl friends love to compete, but we clashed. but i‚Äôm an 8, and i loved the challenge and glamour of her."
Enneagram,fozzxm9,t3_g94r7r,1588199891.0,"keep your word! trusting is so difficult for a type 8, and sometimes 8‚Äôs might be put off by the flexibility and calmness of a 9 (skeptically we might perceive it as not genuine). my best friend is a 9, and i feel the most heard by her when we make plans and she remembers them, and when she‚Äôs there for me when i need help. sometimes i feel disregarded by her when i start to show the intense sides of my 8 personality and she withdraws. being there for an 8 by keeping your word and letting them know they‚Äôre safe to trust you without fearing abandonment or betrayal when things start to get intense is the first step, in my opinion. üñ§"
