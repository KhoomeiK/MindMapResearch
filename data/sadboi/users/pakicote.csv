So first I started readying about it on mba.com.

then I joined some gmat Facebook groups and read about people’s experiences, there are some useful tips there, you just need to read a lot of garbage posts.

then I started to evaluate online courses and went for a six month magoosh course for the gmat, I started it about a week ago and I’m learning a lot. 

I downloaded the official gmat book guide for 2019 in a pdf, I can send it to you if you want. 

Oh and I joined gmatclub.com, there is a ton of useful info there.

Start saving because taking the gmat is expensive, at least for me, and that’s just the start of the expenses for a masters degree."
