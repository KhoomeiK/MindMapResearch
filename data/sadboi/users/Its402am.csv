antidepressants,fqb4dk8,t3_ghow8l,1589230374.0,"I am honestly so jealous of your lucid dreaming. I meanwhile study hard and train to lucid dream and have only purposefully pulled it off  three times. 

However, my dream life on ADs this round has been awesome honestly. I have always been a vivid dreamer and I remember what I dreamt quite clearly most of the time, but lately my dreams have been long, intricate and exciting. I am a world-builder and have been super lucky that I'm getting to see and visit the people and places in my dreams lately. Such a nice little treat <3

When I found out that ADs can intensify your dreams I actually got very nervous because I also suffer from terrible nightmares on unlucky mornings, when I tend to have them, and they can throw off an entire day. But so far, even though I've had some fairly disturbing dreams over the last few months, I wouldn't call them nightmares. I haven't startled awake with a pounding heart in weeks and it's sooo nice."

Remind yourself that you may benefit 1-3 months down the road and you won’t know for sure unless you stick it out that long. One moment at a time c: try to focus on anything else while you wait.

AskReddit,fpiufob,t3_gdhll9,1588648964.0,"When I was 7 or 8, I was molested by some older kids (like 12ish) while at a daycare. When the daycare managers found out, they called my mother and I to an office meeting, where the kids were confronted. 

The office was essentially in a little attic with a window that overlooked the inside of the community gym, which was above the play-area where the incident had happened to me. There was a group of kids playing in the gym while this very somber meeting took place. I was mostly confused and anxious because I regretted telling on the boys who'd fondled me (I was afraid they were going to make my life worse now that I'd gotten them in trouble). Actually, I remember the two boys were being extremely sulky, I assume because they were more aware of how much trouble they were than I was. I was mostly very embarrassed.

Out of fucking nowhere, while my mother was expressing how upset she was with the boys and the establishment as a whole for just leaving us alone downstairs, some kid from the gym threw a rubber chicken at the window, and it hit the window with a **THUNK** and a quick *hoNK* and I completely lost it.

My mom and the managers gave me the look of death and the boys weren't laughing either so I had to plug my nose to keep from cracking up while the fates of the boys who pulled my pants down were decided upon."

antidepressants,foqb9hd,t3_g8wey8,1587989088.0,"Hello c: I completely understand and feel you my friend. I have medical anxiety and OCD surrounding medications. I was TERRIFIED to start escitalopram after I had tried a different medication and it backfired pretty badly. However. In spite of all of the tears and fights with myself and tantrums I threw due to how afraid I was to start, I got past the worst of it and I am doing sooo much better. I’m not perfect but I am thankful I allowed myself to go slow and to ease into the medicine. Here’s what helped me.

Start by picking a day and time to start when you will feel safe. Maybe the weekend, maybe when someone you trust can be with you in person or over a call, etc. Try to follow through when you pick it. 

Ask your doc if you can start really small and increase very slowly. This helped me the most. See if you can start at 5mg for a while if 10mg is too much right away.

Prepare safe, comforting things to do immediately after you take your meds. My things were preparing a ginger tea, sitting under a weighted blanket, and heating up a flaxseed bag for heat therapy. Then I’d just look at memes or something funny and distracting for a while. 

Consider taking them at night, and follow the pill with something soothing and safe to help you sleep through some side effects, like a tea, meditation, listening to an audio book, etc. 

Keep reminding yourself that every time you think of a negative side effect of your medication there are benefits waiting for you on the other side. Give it your best effort to stay on your medication for three months at least. Consider consulting a pharmacist if you are concerned about how you’re responding to your medicine to help you determine what’s normal and what to continue to expect. 

BUT, take care of yourself too and don’t force yourself to suffer. If the side effects are very unpleasant, keep your doctor and loved ones in touch. If they are unbearable, you aren’t trapped. With a doctor’s guidance, you can ease off of your meds, rest, and try a different option. There are many out there. I’ve gone through several antidepressants - so far, escitalopram has been the biggest help to me, and while I’ve had some negative side effects, they are certainly outweighed by the benefits so far! 

I know you can do this. Keep breathing and focus on the fact that no matter how this goes, you are doing everything right."

COVID19_support,fm917tm,t3_ftnmvs,1585859795.0,"Please please please try to take everything one day at a time. Try not to make predictions for the future, neither yours or society’s. Even experts have no real idea how quickly this is going to pass and what’s going to happen after. 

The important thing to note is that it WILL PASS. 

And yeah, things are going to change. Think about it - over the years, MANY things had to change. We were born into those changes as our normal. Eventually, things will feel normal. We’ll be worried about other things eventually. But you can’t get worked up about those other things because they haven’t happened yet, right? 

Same goes for the predictions you’re making, in regards to businesses, the length of time we will be self-isolating, etc. 

In addition, try to practice some compassion and kindness toward yourself. It isn’t selfish to want to come out of isolation. Especially if you struggle with things like anxiety or depression! The three things to work through a day when you struggle with mental health are self care, a sense of accomplishment of any kind, and reaching out to connections. If you needed to acces those connections in person, of COURSE this is very hard for you. I’m sorry it’s been hard. 

It’s good that In spite of that, you’ve acknowledged that this is for your safety and to help guarantee a quicker time in quarantine, and that you’ve also reached out to people through this forum. You’re doing everything right, in spite of how hard it is. 

Try to keep distracted, take good care of yourself, treat and reward yourself whenever you recognize that you’ve not been so focused on the future, and try to live one day at a time. One moment at a time, one now at a time. 

We’ll be looking back on this exchange from the other side soon. We’ll get through this. It WILL pass."

neurodiversity,fll0twj,t3_fphdl0,1585251501.0,"I mean. I can agree with the first half. I think the fact that I’m “high functioning” because I can work (barely) and pay bills and take care of myself (mostly) is why psychiatrists and therapists keep shrugging their shoulders at me when I ask to look into autism further and why I haven’t been recommended any sort of guidance for my other neurological issues apart from mass-market pills that’s didn’t work. 

I can’t speak for the second half as I’ve had no experiences on either end."

COVID19_support,flkufat,t1_flk25cq,1585247878.0,MAN I agree with this. I worry about suffering and the suffering of others.

As soon as I was ready to go back to the right time, I just synced up my clock again. Surprisingly the game does very little to punish you for time travelling."
