Will the work be split evenly? how will you manage 5 kids if you are both working? do you two have enough to raise 5 children?

this is a huge issue and if no agreement can be come to, you two don't seem to be compatible. couples counseling may help (just a thought that came to my mind)"

if this isn't the case nor is her lack of work because of her back problems she is taking advantage of you. if you lay out clear expectations for her and she is unable to meet them or look for ways to get better you should leave her for sure. I do think her relative young age isn't helping here since she hasn't had long to be an adult (if at all).
