narcissisticparents,fpt2gdl,t3_gfc6if,1588883703.0,This is exactly my relationship with my mother. We weren't close when I was young and when I was 14 I told her that I'm an atheist. She didn't speak to me for two years (while we lived in the same house) then accused me of bullying her?! Since then she's been unable to understand why we're not best friends even though she's never even apologised for or acknowledged that this happened.

TrueAtheism,flqdsew,t3_fqaca5,1585390449.0,"I do the same thing, but having been one of those people who was fully integrated with their religion my life is so much better without it. Being able to be myself without constant fear of hell or judgement, or having to judge everyone else is (for me) definitely worth the trauma of leaving. So I can never tell if they'd really be better off without religion or if its just my experience."
