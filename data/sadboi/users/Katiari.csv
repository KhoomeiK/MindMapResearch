# Talk to Oberin, and receive the quest ‘Fall of the Oberin League’.

I did the pre-requisite quests for Oberin before I was level 55, and before I was Artisan 2. I came back to do the follow up ""Desert Buff"" quests with him, and now he won't talk to me. Not a ""He has nothing to say"" sort of talk... it's like the NPC is a building. There's no menu or dialogue or window or anything.

I have a ticket in, but Reddit tends to be smarter than Tech Support. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

And, here's a June 1918 article from the trade publication Earnshaw's Infants' Department said, “The generally accepted rule is pink for the boys, and blue for the girls. The reason is that pink, being a more decided and stronger color, is more suitable for the boy, while blue, which is more delicate and dainty, is prettier for the girl.”
