Just my opinion, driven by observations of the general public where I'm from(a traditionally fossil-fuel based area) and enough of an understanding of mathematical models and the people who spent their lives pursuing scientific discplines to feel that it is audacious to say that 97% of the scientific population educated in that particular field all went into a room and said ""let's fuck with the general populace and rip on oil, eh?"""

You can also get him into occasional mild stunlocks if you keep attacking until you see him swing, because he's easily stunned when he whips out his bow. Sometimes the best thing you gotta do is take a rest from the game for a couple hours, a day or so.
