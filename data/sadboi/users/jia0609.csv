AnorexiaNervosa,fqzvqxk,t3_glr0sk,1589776576.0,"If I were your friend, I think what I'll really appreciate is a basket of fresh fruits. From a recovering anorexic's point of view, a basket of fresh whole fruits would cause the least anxiety. If I was given cookies, I would freak out over the calories and get really anxious (although yes, you made it out of goodwill)

Or, gifting something other than food would be better too. Food isn't always your only option."

They should help with stimulating your hair to grow out again. If you want to lessen your hair loss, you have to consume more of food thats rich in vitamins/proteins/gd for ur body and keep it down, just for the time being. I was so stressed by my hair loss last year that I just ate and kept more food down bcos I genuinely wanted my hair to cime bck"

EDAnonymous,fko7mpt,t1_fknyncw,1584381691.0,"I am seeing a therapist, and a psychiatrist but my fam doesnt know about it. But after I purged and showered just now, I realised that it was impossible for me to recover without involving my parents. So usually my mom hates all this ed talk and would always yell at me for hving an ed and that was why i was rly afraid to include them in my recovery process and didnt. Till an hour ago. I spoke to my mom while holding hef hands, I cried, we hugged, I told her it wasnt her fault, I told her pls not to get angry at what I will be telling her next. I told her ""you know abt my ed right?"" And told her what happened just now, how my binge was triggered and how she can support me by avoiding my triggers and thankfully, she was unusually supportive, unlike hows shes been in the past. So i guess thats another good achievement I made today, by communicating and involving my mom in my recovery process."

This happened to me once when I just woke up from my sleep and I felt my whole body was perfectly fine, so I proceeded to get up to walk, without even realising my leg had gone numb and I lost sensation of my leg. So when I stood up to walk, i fell. Hahaha, it doesnt really happen to me now ever since, but I think in ur case, it may be just due to not moving for a long time, so ur leg went numb and u fell when u tried to stand up. If this happens too oftenly, maybe you should seek medical help on this hmm. But if it happens once in a while, it shouldnt be much of a worry!"

Thats why I moved to a new study environment, now I study in my dining area (wheres thrs no bed!) and I'm SO PRODUCTIVE. 2 hours at my living room and I literally finished studying what would take me 4-6hours in my bedroom (due to all the distractions that cause my attention span to shorten).
