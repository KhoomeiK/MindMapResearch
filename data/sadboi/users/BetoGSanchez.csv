Swimming,fmx3gzt,t1_fmvl64w,1586457794.0,"I only worked on my turbo gear for only 1-week because of COVID-19 but here is my review:

The main difference is the material, turbo briefs aren't really elastic so you really need to get the size right (of you hips), if you get a smaller size they will squeeze you and if you get a bigger size you will get an old saggy grampa tighty-whity. They also have a double lining which is nice as they make a more uniform shape of the good parts.

Arena has more variety of cuts and Turbo only has one which is fairly low cut in the hip and high in the thighs but I think they look good, as I read on the internet they really last years of hard training so it is a good investment. 

Also they have some crazy designs, some I really liked like one with some colorful and happy skulls, I do recommend them."
