If you lose your temper (which let’s face it you must be furious, I was) apologize later and explain why it happened. When you want or need something, think ahead about your needs, when patients come every 10 minutes asking for something new, it really frustrates staff because they can’t get all their work done or attend to other matters or patients. But to them it may also be interpreted as someone who’s thoughts are disorganized, thus needing a longer stay. For example if you know you’re going to shower, and you want to also change your sheets that day, ask for all the bed linens when you ask for towels, and everything you’ll need to shower.

Antipsychiatry,foz6b68,t3_ga5wzn,1588185409.0,"Please rethink taking your life. When I was your age I was chronically suicidal. But it really can get better and you’re just at an age where you can legally separate yourself from your family. Your life is worth something, even though you’ve been put through trauma. 

Could you tell us a little more about what’s going on? Maybe we can give you some good advice on making the stay as short as possible. 

Some family members pull this shit when they have concern for their loved one, but don’t know what else to do. It’s horrible bc a lot of the time they are told that this will be a “therapeutic” process and they think they’re helping. What a horrible position to be in, for them and you. 

What I can tell you to get out ASAP- stay in behavioral control, every injection pushes back your discharge date. Do not repeatedly ask about discharge, clinicians see this as a red flag. Do talk to your team in there about what’s going on- ask them what the reasons are you’re in there and ask them what changes they want to see to feel comfortable discharging you. Make them feel like you’re working with them. Follow the unit rules, don’t talk back to staff, even if you really, really want to. Shower daily, keep yourself clean and well put together. Sleep when they tell you to sleep, be social with other patients you’re comfortable with. 

I know this feels like the last thing you want to do, I’m just telling you how to get out fastest. I know this sucks. I know you’re in a lot of pain and it’s all valid. You might feel betrayed and that’s okay to express. Staying clam is the biggest thing. They want to see that if you NEED to cry, you make use of the comfort room or your bedroom, or talking to staff about it. They want to see that you’re in control of soothing yourself. I’m so sorry this is happening to you. I know this must be the absolute worst way to spend your 18th bday. I was also tricked into psych admission at age 20 for suicidality. I was so fucking angry. But I took the meds, I did what they told me, I worked with them for my discharge plan when they brought it up. I got out in a week. I mended my relationship with my family, they were devastated that I had to be put in there, even though they were instrumental in putting me there. I did yoga and worked out and showed them I had other coping mechanisms that I actively used. You could even suggest a family meeting once you cool down to discuss what their concerns are and why you’re there. Speak dispassionately and don’t yell, if you always look like the bigger person they have no reason to keep you. 

But please, if you do want to kill yourself, reconsider. You can make a whole new adult life for yourself. There are things to look forward to. Please, if you’re willing, be honest about why you feel suicidal. 

Please take care of yourself. Your life and you ARE important. Best of luck."
Antipsychiatry,fov4nra,t3_g9l2wv,1588095319.0,"God I feel this. I struggle with this. I’m learning to become a psych NP. I’ve worked as a nurse on inpatient psych a lot. People are always shocked when they don’t want to take their meds and I’m like “okay, that’s your right”. Some nurses yell at patients about this shit. But far be it from me to force anyone to take meds with severe side effects, or like any meds at all. 

I’ve seen good and bad psych providers. Some see a utox and see that this person is having psychosis bc they did K2, and it needs to come out of their system. So they maybe give them short term things like Ativan until they feel more like themselves, then wean them down. Some people come in complaining of voices and saying they’re suicidal bc of them, they want help, they like their meds and they need an adjustment. I’ve seen great doctors help some of this population, if the patient wants it and is educated on the risks of meds, that’s their choice. I’ve also seen providers throw everything at a patient and hold them for like 6 months or more bc they won’t take their meds. It honestly makes me angry cry. I get very upset seeing cruel coercion tactics. 

I recently learned that there are community clinics where I live that are meant for people right when they come out of the hospital. I recently decided that this is where I want to work. In these spaces you work collaboratively with patients to fix the regimen, perhaps taking patients off of drugs altogether. I know this sounds idealistic, but it’s the type of provider I want to be. Someone who doesn’t force anything. Someone who really listens. Sometimes people are just depressed bc of life circumstances, maybe all they need is a social work referral to help with benefits they’re entitled to, in order to get rid of that added stress in their daily lives. 

I honestly feel so conflicted about this profession. I don’t want to be in a position to force meds on anyone. I want to help people holistically. I found a provider like that for myself, it changed my life. She waited until I was ready to try something, which took like 6 months. In the meantime we did therapy and she educated me on the meds. I did my own research too, of course. But the whole process is so painful."

Antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and SSRI/SNRI’s all have to build up in your system to be effective. Though, antipsychotics can be used as needed also. It depends on the severity of your symptoms. Some people can manage with just PRNs and some people benefit more from a steady med plus or minus a PRN. 

What I would say is that it’s a good idea to be honest with your psychiatrist, like they could be thinking you’re taking your meds daily, and perhaps you don’t need nearly as high a dose or some other modification can be made. They can’t force you to take anything without a court order, unless you’re a risk to yourself or others (in the US). But honestly most psych meds don’t work properly unless taken as prescribed, usually daily. Since the pills are treatment and not a “cure” taking them consistently is the only way to know if they’re working/if the regimen feels right for you. 

I personally benefit from taking cymbalta and Wellbutrin daily. I have chronic pain and the cymbalta also treats that. The reduction in my pain saved my life. This is your treatment, so your feedback is most important."

I would hope that if you gave one to your MD/NP, your RN etc. that they would do what they’re supposed to. I know that’s not what always happens. I can only speak for New York State when I say that we have the NY justice center and state DOH. If a patient calls them and reports their rights being abused it’s a big fucking deal. State officials sometimes come, NYPD might come, at very least you get to speak to several different types of patient advocates in the hospital. 

Here’s an example of the last time I had a patient do this: patient calls and says she was beaten by staff while in the seclusion room. She was put there after hitting and threatening staff, and flipping a table, and trying to assault another patient. NYS justice center opens a case. She’s examined with a female advocate present on top of a female doctor doing the examination. Several hospital admins come speak to her, as does her MD to find out what happened, one at a time, one on one as not to intimidate her. No evidence of physical assault, it turns out of the staff she says beat her, almost none of them were working the night of the incident. She later admits she made it up, she was angry to be in seclusion. It took a couple weeks for the case to be dismissed. The fallout is very serious when this happens. 

At my hospital there is paperwork for everything. I know this answer isn’t satisfying, but my team keeps each other accountable. The hospital audits our paperwork all the time. Patient advocates always come when called, same with pastoral services. I can tell you it’s far from perfect, and where you go for your care (or where you’re taken to) makes a huge difference. 

Can you tell me more about the types of safeguards you mean? Police can sure fabricate things too, like plant evidence or say something happened that didn’t.

Not trying to plug this drug bc everyone reacts differently to them, but I know a lot about this topic. Trust me when I say I would never take a drug I thought was dangerous, I did two months of research before deciding to follow my NP’s recommendations). 

That being said, current research shows more and more that chronic pain can be psychosomatic, and tied to trauma. Some people and practitioners think that makes it less real. It does not! Your pain is pain and your experience is valid. You should be treated with respect. We’re seeing a lot of people now who come in with extensive trauma histories and chronic pain. Some injuries that look fully healed but still cause horrible pain. I believe that medicine knows very little about chronic pain and that’s a huge problem bc they assume people are malingering and they don’t realize that this is clearly medical and psychological to the extent that all people experience trauma and pain in different ways. Also medical doesn’t like the idea that psychological trauma takes a huge physical toll on the body. If you don’t look at someone from a holistic perspective, you’ll never be able to really help them, and you’ll never hear them. 

Feel free to message me about the pain/treatment, part of my work is helping people who are recovering from addiction to opioids on dealing with pain, so I know a lot of the research on this topic and best practices. I can share that research too so you can make your own decisions. I never prescribe anything in my own practice that I wouldn’t take myself. There are a lot of non-psych drugs that help too and are less harsh on your system than chronic NSAIDs. I also know of non-pharmacologic ways of dealing with pain, therapies and workbooks that I’ve seen really help people (myself included).

When many doctors see a woman with chronic pain, many of them poo poo it and it’s absolute trash. Your experience is valid no matter what. Who would willingly bring that pain on themselves. I’ve been there, it hurts, it’s invalidating and on top of that you’re already in pain. I wish you the best on your journey. It is possible to find relief. Pilates, yoga,  and other low impact exercise helped me A LOT. I always tell friends and patients that one thing will not fix your problems, but you need as many good coping mechanisms as possible. Like medication if one so chooses, is just one egg in the recovery basket. Exercise, therapy, and learning what your other healthy coping mechanisms are takes time but it’s the best shot at relief.

Antipsychiatry,fmoh2ws,t1_fmo8cum,1586258731.0,"Dude reread what I wrote. I never said any of what you assumed, which is also part of the problem. I’m not advocating for anyone doing anything they do not want. People seek out meds bc they think it will fix all of their problems. I’m an RN, I help people by teaching them how to cope. I regularly tell patients that these pills will not solve their problems and then teach them nonpharmacologic coping skills.

I said “people who need help can’t get it”. That does NOT mean automatic meds. I didn’t say we should be handing out SSRIs like candy. I said pharma isn’t profiting when they do get prescribed. Which is a plus. I didn’t say shit about justifying anything with a chemical imbalance. If anything those meds are prescribed because we live in a terrifying, chaotic fucking world. Right now it’s worse. It’s scary and largely people have awful coping skills. If people want to take a placebo pill to feel better, great. People can use them as bandaids. It’s better than long term use. Regardless, what are our alternatives? Are you going to go actually find a good CBT or DBT PhD level therapist that takes your insurance? No. Are you going to find adequate therapy during a crisis, during a pandemic? No. What you can find is someone with a prescription pad, which sucks, but this is America. So maybe those pills make you 10% more content with how things are right now, cool, if you don’t have sexual side effects, even better. Right now I’m in the midst of a pandemic in my city, ravaging my patients. The simple fact is that we cannot replace the “loss of community ritual, loss of jobs, loss of socialisation, knowledge of the crumbling of the global economy, and the break in normal routines” right now. I’m not forcing meds on anyone. But tell me, can you think of an actual alternative? One that works for all of those things? None of us can. We can’t meet, we can’t grieve together, if you live in the city like I do, you can’t even exercise. Can you blame people for trying something that might help? 

I’ve had to isolate myself from everyone I love because of this pandemic. I don’t have the comfort of a single person. Right now I have patients who are dying in NYC, who try to get in the hospital so that they have a roof over their head and food to eat because it’s safer than the covid infested shelter system. How does this sub propose we deal with that? With patients who hear voices that make them want to die during a pandemic where we have no psych beds? Right now the least we can do is provide that person with safety, food, a shower and a bed. That’s what I’m doing to try and he’ll during this pandemic, I’ve already been infected with covid19 because I bust my ass for these patients.

So I see what you’re saying and I’m sure more people now are seeking medication bc of the awful pharma commercials on tv, but what I’m also seeing is that people who want help can’t get it. Since people are isolating, which can make people anxious and depressed, a lot of my patients are relapsing and they can’t get help from overcrowded ERs. It’s a mess. I’m worried about my patients overdosing and no one finding them. 

I just want to say that there are people who do care, who want people to help heal. Some of those crisis lines aren’t to bring patients to the hospital, instead we’re trained to try and de escalate a crisis so we can avoid suicides and people going to the ER for suicidality or anything else and getting covid. 

I worry so much about my patients. I worry about the ones who are homeless and uninsured. Some of my patients don’t believe covid is even real and think it’s a conspiracy. That part doesn’t bother me so much, what bothers me is that people who don’t believe it’s real will act like it’s not real and maybe get sick and pass covid along. 

Guys it’s a fucking mess. 

I take comfort in that the major antidepressants are almost all off patent now, so like no one is making money off of like prescribing Zoloft or Prozac.

So if you have a loved one who is being immature, surely there are beneficial reasons to call them out on it. Think about it this way, this person could be causing unnecessary problems that they later do not take responsibility for, problems that perhaps compound on each other and affect others and themselves. For some people you can see how their lack of insight into their behavior is negatively affecting their own life. In cases like this, telling someone they’re acting immature will hopefully be taken as constructive criticism. 

Here’s an example from my life: an individual is in the hospital and doesn’t want to help in discharge planning (ie. coming to a meeting with a social worker and a doctor on a medical floor), stating that it is “not their job” to do so. In reality this person is scared of managing this condition on their own, and the team just wants to lay out covered options to set them up with their preferred next level of care. Said patient may talk poorly to the staff, insulting them. They may do immature things like flip furniture or yell at anyone, seemingly out of no where. They may then attempt to strike their nurse on the day of discharge bc their plan isn’t what they wanted, even though the team tried to ask for their input and their anger is at a boiling point about everything that just happened to them (meaning getting sick, having to stay in the hospital etc). I mean life is hard. But in this case the patient struck a nurse and now their discharge is ruined. 

As a provider, telling this person in a constructive way what you see happening- not that they are immature, but that this is an immature way to act and communication could be so much better (not to mention someone got injured for no reason), is a beneficial thing to do. This patient apologized, and explained the mental Hell they were in dealing with so much while coping with a new medical diagnosis. I mean in another person who had a healthier relationship with their emotions, this would have been fine and no one would have been verbally or physically assaulted. 

Something else I’ve seen- some people are not happy to be on psych units. I don’t blame them. They threaten the staff, sometimes assaulting them too. You can explain to these people as a provider that this immature behavior only strengthens the case for being a danger to themselves or others legally. You can explain that their feelings are valid, but that this behavior is immature and unacceptable. Hopefully they gain the insight to see that if they are calm and in control they will have better outcomes. Sometimes they don’t, sometimes people who assault staff all day claim that everyone else is the problem, even when they strike someone for , say, telling them that the unit is out of crackers until lunch. This is clearly problematic. 

In these cases, plus many more, it can be helpful. How you talk to someone really matters though."

Paranoia and psychosis are NOT curable. They are TREATABLE with antipsychotics. The reason your doctor won’t take you off is because of this. In fact your doctor is doing something great by trialing you on abilify. People tolerate this med well. It has the least amount of side effects (metabolic and otherwise) of ALL the medications in its class. Abilify also has the lowest risk of tardive and EPS of all the antipsychotics. 

Paranoia and psychosis will only get worse if unchecked by medication. The biological reasons for this have to do with the overproduction of dopamine in certain areas of your brain. These medications help keep you in check. 

The best outcomes for people with these symptoms arise when people take their medications as prescribed. The longer you’re off, usually the worse off people are.

pharmacology,fg1cfcy,t1_fg0xq9d,1580424651.0,"Great points!

To your first comment- this is true. However, we now have so much data on SRI’s that it’s a moot point. We typically have a better understanding of how drugs work now than we did back then, but ketamine is still largely speculative. Additionally, some of the things we do know about ketamine show some potential problems for many different populations. Since SRI’s were developed with knowledge from tricyclics and MAOI’s, we had some idea of what the targets in the brain were. Now that we know how safe they are, it would be hard to get a provider to switch to something as experimental as ketamine. Just a thought here, but it would be more likely that a provider would try lithium or electroconvulsive therapy for depression before ketamine since there is so much more data for these in terms of safety and efficacy. 

To your second point- my unstated assumption here was that an oral medication would be developed. It’s not really feasible or scalable to have depressed people on IV ketamine, oral formulations increase adherence. The system in the US for medication patents is undeniably trash, however, some insurance companies do cover new drugs. My thinking here is also more long term since it will take forever to get these meds invented, studied, and approved. Once they are approved and the patent expires, oral medication will always be cheaper and more feasible than IV formulations."
pharmacology,ffzgp0t,t3_evur1p,1580378200.0,"There are so many reasons ketamine is not first line while SSRIs/SNRIs (SRI’s) are:

1. We have a lot of data on short to mid/long term effects of SRI’s, but no data on mid/long term effects of ketamine in humans. The data supports that SRI’s are not just extremely effective, but also very safe. 

2. Ketamine is known to wreak havoc on your kidneys in a dose dependent way. This is also true of your bladder and your liver. This is not a concern in SRI’s

3. Right now the only FDA approved methods of using ketamine for depression are IV infusions in which you dissociate for anywhere from 40 minutes to 6 hours and have to be medically supervised OR you can use an inhaler. Because methods other than IV ketamine cause variable absorption, almost all studies of ketamine study IV doses

4. The doses for depression/ketamine haven’t even been established yet and require a lot more research. Right now it’s hit or miss

5. SRI’s can be taken by mouth and require almost no medical monitoring. Since ketamine is largely experimental this is not the case

6. Ketamine infusions seem to be the standard for depression, but they don’t last long. Effects wear off in as little as 4-6 weeks, then you need another infusion

7. Ketamine has been observed to cause cardiac issues, and at very least raises blood pressure and pulse which is undesirable in many populations 

8. SRI’s are cheap af. Ketamine injections are largely still experimental, even in FDA approved. Ketamine is ridiculously fucking expensive. Insurance doesn’t cover it. You would pay a metric shit ton of money for every infusion to cover the ketamine clinic, the drug, and the medical monitoring you would need. Add to that the cost of losing a whole day every 4-6 weeks

9. You can’t abuse SRI’s, but you can absolutely abuse ketamine. The inhaler’s absorption is variable, but it raises a very serious concern of abuse and addiction

10. We genuinely have no idea how ketamine helps depression, mechanisms of action of SRI’s are well established

11.  Guess who gets studied in the vast majority of these ketamine trials? Well off white people. This is true of all drugs, but we have decades of research on SRI’s. There is much more data on SRI’s on all populations

12. The logistical issues of getting the ridiculous amount of people with depression on regular ketamine infusions are staggering given the expense, potential complications and medical monitoring

13. Some people have horrible reactions to ketamine, the dissociation/trip you get is traumatic for some people. I cannot stress this point enough. 

14. Some patients are still not responsive to ketamine. Some people are depressed largely bc of psychological problems and honestly, a lot of people don’t want to do the work they have to in order to process their trauma and/or their mental illness. Medications just will not make someone in a shitty situation happy. They may make things more tolerable, but there are so many factors that influence depression and it’s treatment. Many of my patients assume that medications will fix all of it, but really in psychiatry you get out what you put in. Unfortunately in the US that’s also inexorably tied to class/wealth. Best of luck finding adequate mental health coverage with bad or no insurance 

15. Many people with depression are actually suffering from bipolar disorder, or major depression with psychotic features, or even a prodrome to illnesses like schizophrenia. Ketamine has not been studied in these populations, but what I do know of the speculated pharmacology involved here implies that it would be a terrible idea for so, so many reasons

16. Lastly, ketamine has shown to be neurotoxic. Affecting cognition and brain structure in rodents and in humans who have recreationally abused the drug

I hope this helps to explain what you’re seeing in terms of ketamine not being used on a wide-scale. The scientific community is honestly more excited about the potential for new and better antidepressant medications derived from ketamine, than the use of ketamine itself since it’s currently so unrealistic for people who aren’t independently wealthy."
