I realized that as I grew older, I was picking up different kinds of books for whatever reason that just weren’t cutting it for me. So I went back to the genres I loved as a kid, and it made me re-engage. I’m also not sure how long you’ve noticed this issue, but I am having the same issue during this pandemic. I am incredibly distracted by anything else while reading, and I am slogging through books unless I find a REALLY good one. And even then sometimes I can’t bring myself to sit quietly with my thoughts for too long.

ELATeachers,fich2fb,t3_f26a5f,1582346929.0,"In case you’re looking for more feedback (3rd year):


1. Others have said it varies by school and this is true. At my school we have autonomy within reason — we have a list of books per grade that we can choose from. We are allowed to obtain class sets from publishers for use if approved by the department head. We also can request new books that the school can purchase. 


2. It’s tiring in an odd way — I am mentally exhausted about halfway through the day. By the time I get home I’m wiped, but physically don’t feel it. Occasionally my brain needs a nap. The worst part is the work I inevitably take home. We are on a block schedule, so I get one hour of prep time at school usually, sometimes two. This is not enough to plan lessons for the 4 different classes I teach. And it certainly isn’t enough to grade everything (my department requires 4-5 graded/commented essays a term). I spend a lot of that prep time answering emails, completing things for students (IEP updates, compiling work for students long term, contacting guidance/families). Occasionally we’re asked to cover classes if the school doesn’t have a sub. And the copier is always broken, so between all that I probably have about 20 minutes to an hour a day to really do work at school. 


3. My school offers some professional development. We have four full days reserved, where one will be a guest lecturer of some sort and another is a day of workshops. The other two are for department time and random administrative meetings/training (mostly safety or tech). We have collaborations a handful of times a year (high school level) which is mostly a department meeting. Occasionally we’ll look at data and collaborate, but not often. Other schools do it much differently. I keep up to date independently. I’m Massachusetts where I teach, we are required to set student and teacher goals yearly. I always make researching new pedagogy part of my goal. 


4. I am never bored. I don’t think there is time for that. I don’t think I’ve ever looked at the clock and counted the minutes until the end of the day. And if I have it’s in a panic trying to finish grades before they’re due at the end of the day. I get frustrated frequently by administration. Students can frustrate me too, mostly when they don’t follow simple instructions. 


5. Most difficult — work/life balance; best part — something new everyday, exciting to see kids improve and get excited when they are passionate about something, summer reset knowing you made a bunch of mistakes but you get to try it again next year; worst part — grading, waking up at the crack of dawn, 25 minute lunches lol


6. A lot of kids don’t care about your class and you need to find ways to engage them in a real way that matters to them (which is really hard for my lower level seniors at the moment). Phone/air pod use is horrendous. Kids will be absent for a long time occasionally or won’t show up consistently, but you still need to figure out how to catch them up (I swear I’m always more stressed about that than they are). There are always policies and changes being tossed around. A lot of them don’t stick and they can be a pain in the butt when there are so many bigger issues out there. Read up on social-emotional learning. The amount of kids I’ve had to teach while they go through traumatic life events is shocking. 


7. I am passionate about teaching and love the job when I plan great lessons that get kids talking and thinking about the world. There is nothing better than watching a kid come to understand something and grow. It makes me proud to be able to help them along with that. For me it’s less about the novels and more about the world experience and skills they get from them. It’s a lot of fun!! There are definitely times in the year (looking at you midterm week) when I wonder what the hell I’m doing here. But it’s worth it."

ELATeachers,etdciqs,t3_casu51,1562703882.0,"I’ve taught 9th and 11th for the past few years at a few different levels, but I usually assign the reading in chunks. I make my lessons focus on the reading done for homework with small discussions, group work, skill work, or even grammar/vocab work. I can usually find something to pair with each chapter or section, but I do admit that around 3/4 of the way through any novel, I hit a dead end. I usually take that time to assign some sort of writing assessment to gear up for the ending. My school is on a block schedule, so on days where I assign homework for the next school day, I give 20 pages (to honors 11th) and 10 pages (to ACP 9th); on days where I don’t see them, they will get no more than double that. I try not to give them more than 20 pages of reading for weekend homework. My school has a 30 minute homework policy. 


I have also done reading completely in class (with every level). I try to vary the kind of reading. Some days I’ll read entirely. Other days the kids read out loud as a whole class. Small groups. Independent. This can get super boring depending on how often you do it. I found this more necessary with my 9th graders (we have to read The Odyssey unabridged...), and sometimes they were dreadfully bored. 


This year, I tried a Socratic seminar based in class novel read. I give them the objectives for the day, a list of discussion questions, and a short mini lesson (if time). 15-20 minutes of reading with the audiobook in class. 10 minutes of note taking where they can go back and find evidence for their discussion from the text. And the rest of the class is discussion. I really liked this for the text I chose (Fahrenheit 451) because the kids found it interesting and relatable. 


The only methods I’ve found that hold kids 100% accountable for actually reading the book are the seminar and reading in class. I have tried quizzes and do-nows to assess if they read, but still an alarming number of students will pass with spark notes! Hope this helped!"

My school has a heavy writing focus, so I really only get to a few full texts a year. I’ve also taught Death of a Salesman, Maus (the graphic novel), Ragtime, and A Raisin in the Sun. This year I’m adding Civil Disobedience, All Souls, and Frederick Douglass’ narrative. 


I find this course to be really easy to find themes, topics, and ideas to engage the kids. I’d recommend starting with what skills you want to focus on for the year — for me I like to get kids thinking in a more “college” way. I like to teach the different critical lenses they will encounter, as well as more specific skills in analyzing literature. This is the first year I think they can truly be independent with their thinking on a more sophisticated level.

The last is something I read this year which changed my perspective about behavioral issues, which has also changed how I approach discipline in my classroom. It seems overwhelming, but even taking some of that philosophy with you can be life changing for both you and the student."
ELATeachers,eqepn6p,t1_eqdrqov,1560007593.0,I have a ton of resources for practicing the exam. I’m looking for more to do throughout the year to help build skills. I’m not super confident in my non-fiction curriculum since my school heavily focuses on fiction. Maybe I should have clarified my question hahah!!
ELATeachers,eqepfuj,t1_eqca2g2,1560007503.0,"I want to, but not sure if my school will reimburse me, and it’s pricey! I’m only teaching one section because my department is doing a senior and a junior session for the first time. There’s no guarantee I’ll teach it next year, so I was planning on gathering resources from other teachers and online this year, and if I get more sections next year, I’ll take the course. I’m glad to hear it’s worth my time though!"
ELATeachers,eor0usa,t3_bsh2ui,1558799445.0,"I had my juniors do a conspiracy theory project to learn how to navigate authoritative sources. It took about a week and a half (mostly out of class) for them to complete with a presentation component. They LOVED it, and I heard a lot of other students talking about how much they wanted to do it too. It was really interesting to see them getting into a topic authentically, and trying to persuade their audience about their conspiracies."
Teachers,eodzgcw,t1_enu2fjo,1558484639.0,Some people just suck at exams.

Handwriting,eod2fxw,t1_eoaczf0,1558467493.0,"Thank you! I’m an amateur stuck in a rut, so I’ve been trying to get more creative with the flourishes and bounce for now. Shading and blending is hard."
