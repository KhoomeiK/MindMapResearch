BipolarReddit,fh86ele,t3_f1bfxx,1581353043.0,"So much. So so much. When I’m sad or upset I always have to make it seem like I’m not because everyone just assumes that I’m too sensitive. When I’m mad I have to isolate myself because people never take my anger seriously, especially when I’m manic and snappy with everyone, but if I tell anyone that, my anger is immediately invalidated by the fact that I’m going through a manic episode. 

No matter what I do, my feelings are always invalidated by my illness, so I learned to just shut everything away and pretend that I’m alright all the time because that’s the only thing anyone wants to see. If I don’t do that then I’m “crazy,” or “psychotic.” Simply for expressing my feelings.

It’s so exhausting to never be able to fully express myself"
BipolarReddit,fgk2xq3,t3_eytes3,1580856383.0,"My mom does this to me and it is so frustrating! Like why are you trying to invalidate my emotions? Also, even if I didn’t take my meds, why should that discount what I’m feeling???"
BipolarReddit,ffe4aox,t3_et40ek,1579836325.0,"I completely understand that feeling. I used to be terrible about acting according to how others would feel. I’m really only slightly better now, but I’m working on it. There is a really delicate balance that you have to obtain I’ve noticed, because you shouldn’t be denying your feelings in order to make someone else comfortable, but there’s also a time and place to put things aside and understand how your words/actions might affect people. I think what helps me the most when trying to navigate when to hold back and when to act is my emotion in the situation. If I feel like my feelings are hurt or that someone is being unfair to me, I try to make an effort to at least explain how they made me feel that doesn’t make it seem like I’m attacking them. However, when I’m angry with people over something they did/said, I try to look at the situation objectively(yet not always successfully). 
Something that’s also helped me is how my therapist taught me to confront people in a way that doesn’t really place blame, which feels a lot better and less like “I’m causing grief for someone over something I did/said” but basically the structure is:
I feel ______when ________ because ________. I would like ________. 
It’s really useful because you can structure the sentence in a way that isn’t accusatory ie
It upsets me when my feelings are being ignored because it makes me feel invalidated. I would like for my feelings to be considered more often
Or something along those lines.
But it’s definitely a hard thing to unlearn, so I’m right there with you"
BipolarReddit,ffe2zje,t3_et38jj,1579835354.0,"I think it would probably be smart to sit down with her when you feel comfortable and describe your symptoms and explain how the new medicine helps. I don’t think that you have to tell her outright that you have bipolar, and it’ll probably be easier for both of you that way"
BipolarReddit,ffe2jzl,t3_et2lbh,1579835034.0,"I understand that feeling a lot and I used to have suicidal ideations like crazy, and it would always be very casual. I will say in my personal experience, I became more aware of it after I’d been admitted after a suicide attempt. 

I will say that if you feel that your ideations are getting out of control, inpatient care is actually probably the best for you. It is smarter to research facilities if you commit yourself, and you’ll hate it for the first few days, but in the end, you do feel a lot more stable. 

Now, that being said, inpatient care isn’t for everyone, but I can guarantee that it will be a whole lot easier if you decide to commit yourself instead of being 1013’d. 

In the end, it is entirely up to you, but it is okay to feel these things and there’s nothing inherently wrong about having these feelings."
BipolarReddit,ffdpily,t3_esrh0o,1579825886.0,"I have really bad paranoia when it comes to things like this, and I usually just find small things that make a big difference. I get that problem with watching horror movies especially, and the fact that I’ve had a fear of the dark for most of my life doesn’t really help, so even If I do something like play a movie overnight or leave a lamp on, those things usually help. I would suggest just kinda messing around and seeing what works best for you"
Clarinet,ffdoptl,t3_et0cv6,1579825383.0,Try looking up the serial number. It should be on the top joint right above the tenon.
BipolarReddit,ffdnrx3,t3_et0poj,1579824807.0,"I currently take lamictal and honestly? Incredible. When I was initially diagnosed with Bipolar, I was diagnosed with BP2 so I was taking SSRI’s and lamictal. When my diagnosis changed to BP1 I was taken off lexapro, so now I only take lamictal and vyvanse. Honestly I feel so much better with this combination and it really does a lot to keep me stable and control any short-temperedness I have, which has always been my biggest issue"
Clarinet,ffdn9mj,t1_ffdmo33,1579824501.0,"B12s are definitely a good starting instrument, but I have a special place in my heart for the E11s, especially the German ones. I absolutely love my Festival though, and it’s wild to me that more people don’t consider it (especially college students) because it’s honestly a much better instrument than an R13 but is only ~ $1500 more. It definitely seemed like I was getting a better deal with the Festival, while also having a very good quality instrument with such a rich tone.

TLDR; I will always advocate for the Festival"
BipolarReddit,ffdmsem,t3_eszad9,1579824210.0,"Alcohol usually accentuates whatever mood I’m in (especially if I’m manic) so I’ve kind of mastered the art of being a modest social drinker (which is very hard to do in college). I will say though that weed really helps with my anxiety and doesn’t make me do anything stupid (usually just makes me sleepy). If you have access to weed, or even CBD it could help wean you off alcohol."
Clarinet,ffdmbxs,t3_esyd7d,1579823930.0,"Typically the longer the instrument, the more resistance, as you’re having to put more air through to make the sound go through. Something that helped me when I started playing auxiliary like Bass and Alto is getting a smaller reed size until my body gets used to the amount of air support the instrument needs"
BipolarReddit,ffdl2cj,t3_et0rnt,1579823150.0,"I had an issue of being v having with my ex. He would always tell people that I am bipolar as opposed to telling them that I have bipolar. It created a lot of issues not just within our own relationship, but with the relationships I had with a lot of our shared friends, especially since he used it to invalidate me and concerns I was having to our friends. 

I wish more people maid the distinction between being and having, especially since saying someone is bipolar is so easily weaponized.

TLDR; if someone close to you refuses to change the narrative of your diagnosis when talking to others, it might be time to leave them behind."
Clarinet,ffdkhii,t3_esp6v3,1579822795.0,"My first clarinet was an E11 and I only stopped playing it about a year and a half ago! It was a very reliable instrument and has great tone quality! I also am just very loyal to buffet as a brand.

P.S. If you ever want to try out professional clarinets, you should definitely try a Festival"
Clarinet,f9s1e0y,t1_f9rz3dl,1575584319.0,Thank you so much!!
Clarinet,f9rcwn7,t3_e4rz5g,1575574563.0,"Maybe try the Rue Lepic's in a size 4 instead. They run softer than a V12, but will still be harder than the 3,5+ in the V12 range."
