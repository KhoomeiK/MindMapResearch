prochoice,fr5gp64,t1_fr5g4cr,1589908274.0,As someome who has studied pregnancy and fetal development (I'm not an expert i just have a huge interest in that stuff so I read a lot about it). Fingers do not form until a few weeks into development. There's definitely no fingers on that embryo. I think prolifers just see whatever they want to see.

EntitledPeople,fpzbwlb,t3_gg7mj5,1589016267.0,Maybe say to her that service dogs are specifically trained so that they don't cause any problems. At least thats my understanding.
entitledparents,fpw1tur,t3_gfnuav,1588955784.0,"Honestly I think kids like anything with wheels. In my high school we had a wheelchair im the drama cupboard. I guess it was there if it was ever needed for a prop. Some kids would play around with it a little in there because kids are stupid. It was kinda fun wheeling around the drama cupboard (the cupboard wasn't that big so it was more of a back and forth thing). But I understand now that that probably wasn't good thing to do and thatm
 wheelchairs likely aren't fun for those who are in the 24/7."
mentalhealth,fplmbcd,t3_ge1dz0,1588715299.0,I like the show. Regarded of what you think. The show has gotten you talking about it and the messages it is sending and ultimately that is getting people talking about mental health which is a good thing.

badparenting,fp3yjie,t1_fp3x5a4,1588288213.0,"But you're kid won't understand why they're being hit
Thats just cruel. There are other ways to discipline toddlers that don't involve physical violence. Redirection is a good way. If your kid is under 2 or 3 and they are doing something they shouldn't do, like trying to throw something. Say ""we don't throw toys/phones/food but we can throw a ball outside"". If you're kid won't listen in the supermarket, put them in the cart or put toddler reins on them. Kids do understand more than you think. If they're a bit older and they are throwing their food or a toy, take it away. You just need to explain things in a way they will understand and you need to be patient. They might now fully understand, but they will understand that certain behaviour is wrong. I've worked with kids and i have two neices and a nephew.  Physical violence it's l never necessary. It's never okay to assault a child because you think they are "" too young to understand""."
badparenting,fp3wyb0,t1_fonnyvg,1588287353.0,You should explain to them why what they did was wrong. Hitting a kid when they don't even understand why is so wrong. They will understand eventually given enough time and patience. Please never be a parent. You've basically shown that you have not got the patience to be a parent.
badparents,fp3wdwu,t3_fs3jgj,1588287047.0,Honestly I did stupid shit like this when I was a kid. Its not aroind her neck. this is how you learn lessons
