 Since you're Pikachu, you'd want to practice movement specific to him like quick attack angles like you mentioned, so maybe you can try going off stage at various positions and see if you can recover with your up b.

CrazyHand,fmg23ud,t3_fv1vue,1586039654.0,"Practice doing reverse aerial rushes or just pivoting into doing back air more. It’s fast, strong, and combos into itself and lower percents so you can do things like carry your opponent off stage and force a defensive option. It’s also just a good tool in neutral in general to space with since it reaches far and isn’t easy to punish.

Another thing I noticed is you kept air dodging to the ground after getting hit, even if you were far from your opponent. Try to mix that up a little more so he can’t try and catch that with a projectile or rush up to you.

Last is you should mix in his aerial down B as a landing option. If it hits it can lead into a combo or kill confirm, and if you B reverse it, it mixes up your movement by changing your momentum which is very useful.

This is just a few things I’d recommend since my friend plays DK and does pretty good, and is a few of the tricks I see him doing."

It’s one thing to know what you want to do and your combos, but it’s important to know what your opponent does and what they are trying to go for, and you can optimize your decision making based around what they do (ex. If they like to jump out of shield a lot, you can try to read it with a back air or something). 

so practice fighting people, in person and online, and see what your opponents habits are. Good players will try to mix up what they do constantly to be unpredictable, but you can still get an idea of what they want to do."

My favorite part about it is how it *always* launches you away from where you are facing, and when it bumps into you, you turn to face it. It means that in the few instances where you hit someone with their back to you towards the koopa, when it explodes after latching you get knocked back towards bowser jr, and can do a kill or combo off it that looks really cool, but unreliable because you almost never will get it to happen or be prepared for it.
