teenagers,f8aycg4,t1_f8ay7m6,1574418624.0,That’s not the point
teenagers,f8ay98q,t1_f8ay7m6,1574418483.0,"Not gonna, when I say I’m picking up and moving I mean myself as a person, not my life"
Psychosis,f8awc5s,t1_eqx1vtm,1574415426.0,"Hey I reopened my alt after a long while to post something else, and yeah I’ve been raised in that type of environment. I’m trying to talk through stuff but my family is not very understanding. They try but they have no idea about anything I went through and they claim to understand while simultaneously misrepresenting everything I say. At this moment I’m probably going to college several states away come next fall, and I think that’s the best option"
mentalhealth,ewgootx,t3_co584f,1565386729.0,"Did better than me today, I fell asleep at 8:30 AM and woke up at 5:30 PM"
Psychosis,evzkd5k,t1_evuny3t,1564959866.0,Yep. It’s a literal closet in my house in which I did all my education on a computer.
mentalhealth,evqqvc7,t1_evqgceh,1564696108.0,My therapist is cool too
mentalhealth,evq8wuz,t1_evq870c,1564688756.0,"The fog, and I also don’t want to be dependent on chemicals of any kind."
mentalhealth,evq6zmv,t1_evq6vjb,1564687647.0,"I don’t want to be on meds, I want to live in a natural manner"
mentalhealth,evpyr1c,t1_evood6n,1564682864.0,"Thanks, and yeah. My parents haven’t been great at recognizing and/or fulfilling my wants and needs. My mom has been outright psychologically abusive as long as I can remember, but just manipulative enough to keep me wondering if she’s just clueless and actually loves me. My current plan of attack is to stick it out and try to survive one more year in their presence so I can get them to pay for college, come home for the summers, and then never return. I do have to worry about my little brother though. I really want to keep contact with him."
mentalhealth,evpxu3l,t1_evonpi9,1564682329.0,Yeah that’s a part of my life I don’t much like revisiting.
mentalhealth,evpxsi5,t1_evp1sl2,1564682305.0,"I’ve done partial hospitalization a few times and it’s been ok. I just want the cognitive function I used to have. Even on the medications when I was very foggy, I showed up hungover and without a calculator to the ACT (idk if you’re familiar but it’s an American generalized test you take and it influences how colleges see you a lot, perfect score is 36) and I got a 32."
mentalhealth,evpxdz4,t1_evp2ktm,1564682068.0,"Thanks, it’s been hard. It feels like my head is barely above water. I feel better off the meds but I’m still not good"
Psychosis,eqj7a65,t1_eqibw4n,1560100134.0,I have a stable family but not really friends
Psychosis,eqj78y0,t1_eqibw4n,1560100118.0,I slept pretty good. I was homeschooled and I went to school in a closet for 3 years. Went out once a week
Psychosis,eqhmtkb,t3_byhq79,1560064567.0,Don’t know where else to put this
