I have had so many starts/stops, and every little bit of extra weight shows up on my 4'11'' frame. Last year, I hired a fitness ""coach"" to assist me with a meal and exercise plan. We worked together remotely for a while before she started trying to shill Isagenix; she said it would help me break my plateau. The lowest weight I hit while working with her was 147, and I wasn't interested in spending hundreds of dollars on laxatives marketed as ""super food"" supplements. After that, I went through some really stressful personal stuff and ended up gaining 10-15 pounds (not really sure, because there were times I refused to weigh).

Like I mentioned before, after several starts and stops I feel like I've finally reached a point where simple hard work and good nutrition are paying off. I've tried Whole 30, keto, low carb, no carb, carb cycling, low fat, low calorie, etc. and have always ended up miserable and food-obsessed. I am tracking through MyFitnessPal and doing Beachbody workouts (no shakes or containers - just the exercise programs). I've changed my focus to eating whole foods with minimal processed items, while allowing myself treats. I'm not starving or obsessing over every little thing, and I'm finally seeing results. It's a really good feeling.
