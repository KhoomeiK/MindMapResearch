SuicideBereavement,fkff6rp,t1_fkfe5rc,1584133055.0,"I know exactly how you feel. I lost my older cousin when I was 13. Im 20 now and I guess I recovered pretty well from it. To me the silver lining was the fact that I knew what comitting suicide does to your loved ones,so in the times where my bipolar disorder was destroying me,I didnt think about killing myself because I knew what would happen with my family (That was when I was 16,now Im super content with life). So,personal growth is,well,personal,we all deal with things differently. It took 5 years for me to get through it. And now,when I remember my cousin,Im happy,happy that he was like an older brother to me,happy that we played together and watched tv together. 
Hope you find what you are looking for. Your brain will probably make out something,even if it takes time. Good luck!"

LSD,fkf44y8,t3_fi1uus,1584126674.0,"I always smoked like 1/2 hours in.
It was amazing (of course)
But last time I did it I didnt have any weed untill like 5/6 hours in.
Me and my friend (who was also tripping) thought it was basically over and it was all dull.
Then we smoked and wow.
The difference was the same as going from sober to high (from weed).
It was amazing and the difference was that all the ideas/concepts where much more visual and clear to me. I had a huge epiphany at one point.
So I recommend to people that they dont smoke right away and smoke after 3/4/5 hours,things get super interesting at that point."
SuicideBereavement,fkf2qyu,t3_fhusni,1584125851.0,"Depression and similar mental illnesses are a RABBIT HOLE. You can say he was selfish but you dont know what was going on inside his head that lead him to do what he did. You should feel some empathy for him. That being said you can learn a lot from dealing with that event and being strong for both you and him if he wasnt. When hard times in life hit,be stronger out of spite to him (if you are so angry). If his actions broke the family do all thats in your power to fix it. Be the ying to his yang (I know that may sound corny but Im just trying to portray my words as best as I can). All emotions (even negative ones) can be used for personal growth.
I hope my message came across and I dont look like a douchebag."

It happens to me all the time,I have like a 3 minute period in a week where Im ""normal"" and I start thinking how I must have been tripping abkut being hypomanic. But I believe being bipolar is precisely the reason why we invalidate ourselves when feeling normal for a brief period of time."

The thing I learned from dealing with such a fucked up event is;live everyday in a way that would make your brother proud. I dont know if you believe in a God,but even if you dont,know this,energy cant be destroyed,it only gets transformed,so your brother is out there,and you will be drawn together in the next ""life"" or whatever happens after we die. You will see him again,and untill you dont,make sure you live your life to the fullest. Much love to you man,it gets better with time <3"
