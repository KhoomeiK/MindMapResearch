Needafriend,eyxkai4,t3_cu9dd7,1567555503.0,i know this is 11 days old but I can't stop thinking about how much i relate to this post and idk if that's a good or bad thing. sometimes it's really tempting to just leave everything behind but then again where would i go
depression,eywi6qr,t3_cz4xf4,1567530067.0,this is mostly just a reiteration of the top comment but yeah we're all depressed for the most part so I'm not sure this place is the best for support unless you're looking for someone to relate too. you could try looking for groups people have made though but they aren't too common in my experience
lonely,eyvci1b,t1_eyvc5ge,1567488355.0,appreciate the offer but I can't I'm sorry I'm shit at talking to people in general

depression,eyul68k,t3_clue8y,1567465136.0,i know this is old but i relate to this a lot. i know I'm young and that things can change but it honestly feels like I'm at deaths waiting room at this point

depression,euhory3,t1_euho3sm,1563831289.0,I'm on effexor now it doesn't really have any effect on me that isn't surface level tbh but I'm sorry you had to go through all that I'm thinking of just quitting all together as well since I'm just kinda tired of feeling like a test subject for meds. also I'm happy for your mom good on her for actually getting a benefit out of it
