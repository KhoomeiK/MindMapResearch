BPD4BPD,f0fo09v,t1_f089pv5,1568586470.0,"I feel this so hard because part what helped me was another person who had very high personal intelligence. Your flat mate may have somebody, but are they connected in a way that would give you the actual fulfillment that we need? Because a lot of couples are just comfortable and attracted to each other. It can be so much more and reach the potential that we are capable of. You have to question your thoughts bc we have sickautopilot thoughts built out of protection and then we have our true wants and desires. Being able to differentiate the two is a life-saver. You’ve already started looking for it. The desire you have to figure it out is soooo huge. There’s no chance if you don’t care enough to say, “why the hell am I doing this? I am grown. Why did I find the answer but no doctor has been able to tell me?” I was so angry at first feeling that the mental health professionals let me down. Keep searching. Find a therapist that makes you ready to be open and honest. Or just tell me everything. You may tell me something that you weren’t aware you felt. Sorry if this is random and jumbled, I’m multi-tasking unsuccessfully. Still love you & your soul. Don’t give up if there are parts of you not ready to give up. Listen."

I wish I could give you an answer to finding your self-worth, but I don’t know how I found it. I’m here to talk if you want to vent about ANYTHING. Hope this finds you okay. I love you, stranger."
