mentalhealth,fqwisx7,t1_fqm9g6g,1589705972.0,"I 100% agree. But to be fair, I read a report somewhere (I don't remember exactly where but I did read it) that these online companies are having trouble finding therapists right now. Due to COVID-19, there has been a crazy surge in demand for online therapy and not enough therapists - that was the gist of the article I read. This doesn't justify the therapist's behavior here; just saying that could have contributed to this specific instance (although I have also read that many people have had this same exact problem even before this virus so...)."
mentalhealth,fqn0x2i,t1_fqmvh33,1589486809.0,"Listen, care about your happiness FIRST and you'll see a major difference. Trust me on it. Just don't give AF about almost anything and you'll see. Good luck with it."
mentalhealth,fqmp3r9,t1_fqmdtg8,1589481149.0,"I feel you, really I do. Just try and go with the flow. Let (almost) everything roll off your shoulders. Really it did wonders for me. Yes there are times your mind starts conflicting with you (as you said) but that's when you just reassure yourself, that's all. It takes times to **really** get into this mindset but once you do, you'll feel a hell of a lot better. Friends aren't important because nothing is really important. Also, there's nothing we can do about it the way people are so why care so much? It's like that Van Wilder movie said (and I generally avoid using statements from movies but this one is great): worrying is like a rocking chair. It'll go back and forth but it'll never get you anywhere. Also, I'd like to point out that when someone stops caring, for whatever reason I have yet to figure out to this day, people flock to you and want to be around you. Since I've become like this, people want to be around me and hang out. My siblings (who care a lot about everything)? Not so much."
mentalhealth,fqlhjnj,t1_fqfm83x,1589458275.0,"I hear you (again). But, I don't think it's so simple. Life is difficult and there's tons of pressure on every individual throughout their life. Caring for someone takes an incredible amount of energy. Also, it's in human nature to care about yourself above anyone else. And now add in the age of instant gratification and materialism, and it seems no one **really** cares about other people.

My view on this is this: we can't do anything about this. You and I are simple people. I'm not trying to change the world because I think this is an impossibility for me to do. Therefore, there are two options here. One, sit and sulk about it. Or two, go with the flow. I choose two. Yes it sucks because I know people don't **really** care about me, but at the end of the day, does it even matter? No. My life will be over in 70 years (max), and then I'm dead for eternity. So why harp on this? I seriously view the world like this and as depressed as this may seem, it's a **fact**. No one can take that away from me. So instead of taking the pissed off approach to this, I try and create experiences in life that make me happy. I'll meet new people who will turn into ""friends"" (notice the quotations)...but my expectations for all individuals have been greatly reduced since I started seeing reality. Once I came to accept this, I stopped caring and this has helped my happiness a lot - I used to be in an even worse mental state (still bad but not as bad as it was). Yes, people will tell me this is unhealthy but honestly? Fuck them. They just choose to live with blinders on. To be clear: I'm not saying that people don't outright care for one another. I'm saying that ""care"" is (pretty heavily) limited. Understand and accept this, and that there's nothing you can do about it, and I think you'll live happier."
mentalhealth,fqfl811,t3_gin8dc,1589326908.0,"I hear your point, and you're largely right. But, IMHO, your parents are obligated to care about you - no one else. The fact that some (many?) parents don't give two craps about kids doesn't take away from the fact that you should be their responsibility (also IMHO even after 18 years of age to an extent - no I don't mean financially but in other ways). It's also supposed to be engrained into human nature (but I guess that's disspelled by the amount of terrible parents in the world)."

mentalhealth,fpfntg2,t3_gaocej,1588577173.0,"Look, I'm not a medical professional, but I will tell you that this doesn't seem like an eating disorder. Before this incident, were you eating (relatively) normally? It seems like you were. Okay, maybe you would indulge from time to time but it's not like you were eating way too much or way too little, right? It seems like it was within the normal range of food consumption.

That said, crappy things unfortunately happen in life. People get cheated on. It sucks and people like that suck. But you should know that it happens a lot. I'm not saying this to cheer you up or justify what happened. On the contrary. I'm showing you that it simply happens. And, it happened to you. What I'm trying to show you is that you are now in control. You can decide what happens going forward. And, you even already started! You started dieting and exercising and it went great at first. **Keep this mindset**. First of all, eating good nutrional foods are important. Secondly, it's good for keeping you in a positive head space and your overall mental health. But, success doesn't come overnight. It is fine to eat and feel full - no problem with that, especially if you're eating healthy and within the bounds of normal portions. Plus, if you are exercising, your body literally needs this food for both energy and to strengthen muscle. If you want, let me know and I can tell you what I did to help me not only lose weight but also keep me in a positive mindset. Maybe it doesn't work for everyone but for me, sticking to a good diet and a consistent exercise schedule was extremely helpful to my overall state of mind. FYI I haven't done this in a long time, which is why I'm not in the best headspace right now, but after reading your post and typing this out, it's clear I should get back to it ASAP."
mentalhealth,fpfm780,t1_fp14mu0,1588575631.0,"Could not have said it better myself. Online therapy is hit or miss. Some people love it, others find zero help with it. I will add that these sites do match you with a therapist who is trained in what you need help with. The problem, at least in my view, is that you can't really connect with a therapist online. Plus, from what I have seen so far, it's not exactly like they help you. They just ask a bunch of questions, and when you give them an answer, it's usually followed up by another question. Like, I came here for help, not to fill out a questionnaire.

Finding a therapist in person (or whatever, just not through online therapy) is the way to go. I have found it costs about $150-200 per session (sessions are usually 45-60 minutes depending on who you're seeing)."
mentalhealth,fpfla7l,t3_gaqic5,1588574777.0,"What I've found to be the most helpful is what you said - going to a GP for a referral. They may or may not receive a kickback but they're also not going to send you to someone who's not trustworthy because it's also their reputation on the line as well. You could also try online therapy (it doesn't have to be done over video either, could be done over text)...but honestly I don't know how effective that is, and people have wide ranging views on it. Some people love it, some people find it completely worthless."

I not only blink hard and fast but I make these noises with my throat and it took me a VERY long time to surpress it. I saw doctors - the whole nine yard. Apparently, I was told multiple times that there's nothing I can do, and that I just have to live with it (on top of my other mental illness...life sucks but that's another story). Anyway, over the years, I have found my own coping mechanisms to deal with my ticks. I'm not saying it will work for you, but **in my experience**, you will need to find your own. Mine is to bite my inner cheeks a lot. Grinding my teeth also helps a lot but that leads me to needing dental work more often than other peopl (I don't recommend it but it has helped me personally)."

I also have a crappy job, very similar to how you described yours. I have been here for a little less than 2 years. My outlook is like this: I constantly remind myself that this is not long term, and that I do have options. After all, the general emploment time nowadays is something like 2-3 years. That may seem like a long time, and it is hell going through it. But, looking back, I know I will forget about this job and it will be a distant memory.
