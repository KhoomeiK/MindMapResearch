Anxiety,f2z3saz,t3_dek2lo,1570505593.0,"Yeah but you DID IT. 

God damn... You should be so proud of yourself. That's a HUGE success. It just gets easier from here. 

Hang in there."
Anxiety,f0uv5ki,t3_d6nn97,1568951829.0,"This is me. I do this all the time. 

Can I suggest therapy (not that this is a revolutionary idea that you've never heard of), it's been good for me in this realm. 

I have someone I know I'm seeing every two weeks- a doctor who can tell me if my symptoms are anxiety or if I should be concerned. It's been a comfort for me. And the more we discuss my symptoms and when they occur, the more clear it becomes to the anxious half of my brain what's happening- and it's been making things a little easier. My brain doesn't jump quite as quickly everytime I get a stomach ache."
Anxiety,f0uutc5,t3_d6eg50,1568951494.0,"Sounds like your asshole neighbor isn't getting laid. 



I know I'd be in the exact same head space as you if that happened to me. I know it. I know it probably won't alleviate your stress- but know that your neighbor is just a dick. You have ONE night where you UNINTENTIONALLY were heard by a neighbor and they do that? That's a bitter person. That's a person who was looking for a reason to lash out. 

This isn't on you. Sounds like they are looking for people to be mad at."
Anxiety,f0ncjmf,t3_d5n1j2,1568766469.0,"Oh boy. I see myself in this so much. I've been here so many times. 

1.) Anxiety is an illness. A sick day, for a day your illness is causing you an unusual amount of discomfort, is what sick days are for. People get sick and take time off all the time- and that's exactly what you're doing. You're not in the wrong. 

2.) There is nothing wrong with not necessarily wanting everyone to know your health status. If I have diarrhea, and I can't go into work, do I say- 'Hey boss- sorry, just can't quit shitting!"" NO. NEVER. I say, 'I have a migraine."" You're essentially doing that, but for your mental health. You're okay. 

3.) You're not going to get fired. Again, people take days off all the time. You took a day off for your mental health- not to drive to another state to go to a concert with your friends. Context is everything. If it DID become a problem (which most likely, it will not), you would tell the truth- and if they wanted to fire you after that... Fuck them. You'll get another job. It might be tough- but you weren't meant to be there anyways if that's their attitude. 


This is how I talk myself down from my own guilt like this. I hope it helps. You're all good. Hang in there. Do what you need to do for yourself. Gotta put yourself first sometimes."
Anxiety,f0nbrtg,t3_d5pit1,1568765893.0,"Hey! Sorry that happened to you. No one likes to feel excluded or put down, but it's especially hard if you have anxiety. (Ex- Over thinking the interaction, replaying it over and over in your head... I struggle with this a lot.)

First, it does sound like your boyfriend was a bit cruel- especially if he is aware how you are struggling and how hard you are trying to make friends. Seems like, as your boyfriend, he should be trying to include you in the conversations- not exclude you. So I definitely don't think you're overreacting. And it definitely warrants further conversation. That wasn't cool. Regardless of how he felt about your question (which was perfectly normal and conversational, by the way), he should be bringing you up and trying to get you to be apart of the convo. 

Second, can I suggest joining some groups he's not in? You may be more at ease to talk and work on social skills- if someone who isn't from irl is watching. Does that make sense? It may take some pressure off yourself.

Hang in. You'll get there! It all takes time. There's nothing wrong with you in the slightest!

Sending love."
Anxiety,evhf1qx,t1_evh5noy,1564525350.0,I appreciate all of this advice and kindness. But I want him to see someone who loves him before he goes.  But I may take some of this other advice. thank you again. Appreciate the love.
Anxiety,esgdoui,t3_c7ijbd,1561950060.0,"I do- but I often wonder if I'm just noticing them because I become so hyper-aware when my anxiety is increased.

&#x200B;

Definitely mention it to your eye doctor,  but don't be too concerned. I used to work at an eye clinic- and the doctor at my clinic always told me ""some"" eye floaters are normal. If it continues to increase, maybe call an eye doctor to schedule an appointment and relieve your stress about the situation."
Anxiety,eroslsr,t3_c2nh5g,1561087570.0,This is such a nice thing to take the time to post. ♥️
Anxiety,erosh3y,t3_c2lzke,1561087467.0,"I won't sugar coat it. 

I can become a full blown bitch. Just the meanest person. 

I have a joke/code phrase with my friends.  If a situation is making me anxious and I feel myself getting angry, I'll excuse myself from the situation. Which is almost always met with a ""Where are you going?"" Or ""Why are you leaving?""

And I'll say, ""I can feel myself becoming a bad person.""

And that's how they know I need to leave to avoid taking out my own anxiety on someone else. And that I'm fighting a terrible bout of rage.

Works wonderfully."
Anxiety,erorqxd,t3_c330ji,1561086903.0,"Okay- this is going to sound dumb. Haha. But I have a suggestion.

I went through a period just like that. Couldn't seem to choke food down. I'd eat and literally end up gagging because everything felt like chewing actual sand. I was a mess. Lost a lot of weight. And I WANTED to eat, but dreaded lunch time. 

I resorted to watching mukbangs on YouTube at lunch time (not the gross 'girl eats ten pounds of lobster"" ones, casual ones, haha. People just having lunch and talking). The talking distracted me from anxious thoughts, and the food gave me a bit of my appetite back. From there, I jumped to cooking shows- including YouTube cooking shows (bon apetite on YouTube is superb and wonderful. You'll love Brad Leon- everyone does, haha). Mukbangs on YouTube have gotten a little... Much, lately. Haha. But I highly suggest a cooking show. 

It worked really well for me. I think the longer you go without eating- the more anxiety there is about eating. Because you feel stress around it now. Listening to people talk while they prepared food was the perfect balance of distraction and apetite inducing. 

Also- don't be afraid to start small. A smoothie. A protein shake. My doctor recommended Carnation Breakfast Essentials for breakfast everyday- that was also a big help. 

Good luck! You'll get through it. Baby steps."
