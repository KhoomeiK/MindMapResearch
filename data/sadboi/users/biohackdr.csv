conspiracy,fqc7uqt,t1_fqbjrow,1589251958.0,"It is actually false. The Indian government has not sued his foundation. 
I don’t see why someone with enough money to buy anything, including governments or pay the external debt of some countries, would want to go to a shithole of a country, then find a shithole town inside said country and start a conspiracy to kill thousands of nobodies, risking being tried on an international court for genocide and lose his freedom and fortune without a clear goal? 

Believe me, someone who made their fortune by creating value instead of speculating on the markets, whose company has never been known to mistreat its employees and who has never had public scandals probably maybe just wants to really help people because he is a very compassionate and educated person. Can you show me some of the charitable work of Donald Trump? They are not even in the same evolutionary stage. 

Actually thanks to Bill’s mind and vision you can watch conspiracy videos made by basement tinfoil hat neckbeards on the other side of the world and proceed to repeat those same fake news in a social network for all the world to see at the speed of light.

“The program will begin immediately with a focus on several new vaccines that protect children against respiratory and diarrheal disease, including Hib, pneumococcus and rotavirus vaccines, and against liver cancer through increased use of hepatitis B vaccine.
