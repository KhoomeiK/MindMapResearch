BlackPeopleTwitter,fpt8lhv,t3_gfbgz0,1588886770.0,The sad part is this is nothing but truth and more than half of the world doesn’t give a fuck... It’s a blessing and a damn curse to be black in America...
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpflqt8,t1_fpelext,1588575208.0,They’re already blaming us... 🤣 China is blaming us for coronavirus and is kicking out their black citizens... the irony...

interracialdating,fpbqw9d,t3_gcgznd,1588476477.0,"Wow!!!! I wouldn’t say you should break up, BUT I would be very careful and pay attention to the next things he says... I’m still stuck at the minority comment... how is he supposed to empathize with you if he wouldn’t even watch a movie or something along those lines...

I think communication is needed right now for the most part. If you truly deep down believe that he’s a racist, I would say trust your instincts because we know deep down.. 

I had the same issue in the past and I kept brushing it off and eventually they just flat out told me... the funny part is; it was my SO gma who called me a slave... She’s Mexican... so, I wouldn’t push it past anyone... I don’t take those black jokes lightly... they’re showing their true colors when they make jokes like this.. and they’re testing you to see how you’re going to react.. are you going to behave and allow it or are you going to misbehave and not take their crap? You know? That’s what I feel like is being done in these situations."
MakeNewFriendsHere,fpbq9g9,t1_fpbgu4f,1588476032.0,Thank you your words are very kind and very helpful. 🤗 They have given me comfort.
MakeNewFriendsHere,fpb8dcy,t3_gbyiyp,1588464293.0,"Wow, I was reading these comments about it being years.. man, i was hoping that the feeling would go away... I have old friends that I haven’t talked to since last year and I miss them like crazy. 😔 I was hoping that I would eventually get over this, but I guess getting over it isn’t something I should look forward to anymore. Lol"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpb573s,t1_fpb4vuc,1588462348.0,"I just told you, if you really wanted to know.. you would do the research yourself... How can you have an opinion of something when you haven’t done the research for yourself???

No, I read what you said earlier to another commenter and I didn’t agree with it... I don’t understand how you being “Mexican american” is relevant to anything anyone’s saying.. 🤦🏾‍♀️ That’s why I didn’t respond to it..

Ah, you’re one of those types of people.. so, you’re just trolling.. we’re done here. ✌️"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpb422i,t1_fpb2imb,1588461666.0,"Honestly. I’m not interested in reading all of that.. We both disagree with one another and that is fine... I’ll respect your opinion, if you respect mine...

You have a good day as well. 😊"

I’m pretty sure you’re one of those people who will deny that privilege exists. 😆

Have a good day. 😊"
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpavu98,t1_fpavg3s,1588456772.0,But that’s going beyond the point.. I just stated what I feel.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpavsbw,t1_fpavg3s,1588456740.0,"Sorry I clicked the wrong person. 😊 

But, when we speak our minds or stand up for ourselves.. Our opinions are silenced or usually people will say irrelevant things... For example; just look at any twitter post and you’ll see the comments.

When we defend ourselves, we’re called ghetto, loud, and angry... It’s ironic because the trolls will come to posts that are targeted for black audiences and they’ll come and say their bs."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fpav3g1,t1_fpatfqd,1588456325.0,"Then why have there been studies done on this? Why are so many dating experts saying that we’re the least desirable? As you can see the one comment above, that’s a good example..."

offmychest,foejr8s,t3_g6zk78,1587705602.0,"I am the exact same way, and I am working in that area of my life.. What I’ve learned is, if someone has the power to bring those emotions out of you.. then; they’re already in control of you.. it’s very hard like you said..

You have to take that power back, you have to tell yourself, why am I going to let you get me that worked up?? Who are you to me?? Why am I letting what you said, ruin my day?? It’s all about control.. you have to let go of what you cannot control.. we can only control our own thoughts and emotions.. you know? 

It’s very tough for me, but that’s where I’m stuck at... in some situations I feel completely powerless, but in others I just let it go..

You have to spend time to yourself and think about what you’re feeling, thinking about, etc... when you feel yourself getting worked up.

I don’t want to get too personal on a public post, but, if you’re still seeking more answers I can tell you in a DM?

I hope some of this helps you."

ftm,fo9871i,t3_g5lm75,1587612810.0,"Your voice doesn’t determine what sex you are... I have a deep voice, deeper than a lot of people... but in comparison to some males, they will say “it’s not that deep..” but I was teased throughout my childhood... it was easier back then.. sometimes I still think about it, sometimes I get funny looks.. but, it doesn’t bother me anymore. (The way it did) I hadn’t ever come across another female with a deep voice and when I did a few years ago, I was extremely turned on... I guess that’s what made me get over it.. Also, I receive lots of compliments on my voice now.  (maybe that’s all you need 🤗)

I honestly think you should ignore it, then, if it continues speak up and ask why that person says that. What does the person mean by it? 

But honestly... fuck whoever it is, a lot of us speak without thinking about the effects it will have on someone... I am so sorry that that person said that to you."
BlackPeopleTwitter,fo8b3k2,t1_fo8a5y8,1587593194.0,How much do you think they get? That’s the real question... I personally know someone who’s only getting 500/mom... that won’t even get you a rented room over here where I live... you’re lucky if you find a room for that amount to rent... and that’s NOT including utilities and food expenses.
BlackPeopleTwitter,fo869kk,t1_fo85oas,1587590652.0,"Yes, but my comment was in reference to the others.. Some people are disabled, retired, etc... they cannot work.. that was the point of my comment..

There’s been so many people on twitter who have come together and solved our “issues” but they will never take effect because it’s not part of their agenda..

There’s so much hate on topics such as these. So many trolls who will come after you, like the one below. Lol"
