Just last night I was talking to my oldest daughter and my Dad about school and he brought up that I used to win every competition in gym class and ROTC. Fastest runner, most pull-ups, most pushups, longest time jump roping, etc. etc. I even went to a performing arts high school and had intensive dance classes and was at the top of every one. I danced for 15 years, 6 of them competitively. 

I remember...but it feels like a different life. My legs hurt just from walking now, there‚Äôs no energy for daily activities let alone staying at that level of exercise. I feel like a lost a very core part of who I was and I haven‚Äôt discovered an identity outside of that. It definitely doesn‚Äôt help my depression."

We currently pay $800/mo for both our girls but as of right now they‚Äôre just ‚Äúon break‚Äù and not receiving educational assignments. They‚Äôve moved up their Spring Break to next week, so that seems to me they won‚Äôt have assignments for that week either.

Or simply marriage/financial status changes before baby is born. Let people be grateful for a support system without interrogating them on why they need it. It‚Äôs none of your business."
NintendoSwitch,f02xq8p,t3_d36us8,1568340326.0,Legitimately watched the entire video expecting it to be a joke. I‚Äôm so confused. How do they think this will sell? And for $80? It looks ridiculous and the advertising is cringe-worthy at best.

I‚Äôve gone through CSpire, AT&T, Verizon, back to CSpire, and finally came back around to AT&T because they are the only ones who offer that ability - which is crucial for my job."
AskReddit,ey99fxy,t3_cw4za2,1566938207.0,"Snipperclips is hilarious. The faces/sounds the characters make are the best. It usually ends with us on the floor in literal tears from laughing so hard. It‚Äôs easy to pick up, encourages you to work together, and you can restart instantly so there‚Äôs no frustration if something goes wrong.

I‚Äôd much prefer being able to actually view things in mobile but even that isn‚Äôt possible. The pop up just needs to go!"

It‚Äôs fucking hard to stop when you‚Äôre panicking over being down, it seems like everyone around you is winning so the win HAS to be there, right? It‚Äôs the next spin, maybe if I bet bigger, different machine? I can‚Äôt lose forever...and some point I HAVE to win. And it happens enough that you get hooked on hope. Until it doesn‚Äôt. Nope. Fuck me, $20 for two weeks til payday."

specializedtools,ewukv21,t3_cq6ewn,1565784611.0,My brain didn‚Äôt register that there was another part of the tool in his left hand and instead registered it as a coffee cup he was casually sipping while scything. I think I drink too much caffeine...
