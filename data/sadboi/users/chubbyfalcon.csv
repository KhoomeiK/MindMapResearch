The OP post sounds like an abusive relationship because there are many elements that sum up. Yelling on its own might be innocent. Yelling+namecalling already sounds fairly concerning. Yelling+namecalling+making him feel inferior+making him feel grateful = probably trauma bonding, emotional dependency and self-worth issues. That's the gut feeling I got when I read it.

\- The 3x5 exercise: name (in your head, or out loud if you're alone) five things that you are seeing. Then five things that you are hearing. Then five things that you are feeling (eg the ground under your feet, the chair under your butt, the backpack on your back...). You can do this one anywhere and while doing anything. 

\- Breathe out through closed lips, making an FFFFffffffhhh sound. Then don't actively inhale, just let the air refill your lungs naturally. Do it two or three times in a row. 

\- Make a clay statue of yourself in your mind. Imagine making a figurine of yourself and molding your body, arms, legs, head, in the position that you currently have. This one can't be done while walking but is great when sitting or lying. 

\- Stand with your arms apart, then let your hands join in the middle on both sides of an imaginary sheet of paper. 

\- Getting back inside your body: first stomp your feet. Then shake your hands like you want to shake something off. Then snort with your lips. Then massage the top of your head with your fingertips. 

\- Strong sensations are helpful. Eg spray your face with cold water. Suck on an ice cube. Eat some wasabi paste. Smell an ammonia inhalant.

survivorsofabuse,eshv7zt,t3_c7vrn7,1562001640.0,"From the advice Sticky: 

 

Being “recovered”, being “normal” and “past it” can take years— but being *happy*, being *ok*,  being *healthy* can happen very quickly.

Wishing you all the best to get through this."
rape,eshuwrl,t1_eshklwk,1562001470.0,"I don't know if that makes the situation more or less difficult. I hope you will find your way to cope. 

Don't let anyone pressure you into ""getting over it"". My imaginary child is seven and a half now and when a professional asked me whether I thought I'd get over it someday I said I might try after its 18th birthday. Give yourself time."
rape,eshj734,t3_c7qrmz,1561994222.0,"Got pregnant from my rapist and had an abortion. 

I'm here for you if you want to talk about it."
ptsd,eshg5aa,t3_c7n5gp,1561992076.0,"Oh yeah I hate this. 

When I explained that my trauma makes me jump at the sound of the doorbell: “But he doesn’t know where you live. It can’t be him.” 
YES I KNOW. 

Getting triggered by someone yelling in my face: “But he wasn’t angry at you, he just thought you couldn’t hear him.” YES THANK YOU FOR THIS EXPLANATION. 

Most my friends seem to think I literally can’t tell a triggering situation from a threatening situation. I’m thinking of printing out a leaflet that explains what PTSD does to the brain and just handing it to people so I won’t have to talk about it anymore."
ptsd,esheurh,t3_c7sgp6,1561991134.0,"I get the disgusting feeling too, I call them disgust attacks. 

I think we all try to smile through it when in public, I actually have a particular cackling laughter that I only do when I’m panicking inside. 

Trying to figure out the triggers is tricky. I recently made a post about that and another user told me they have had PTSD for 17 years and are still discovering triggers. I have started making a list of possible triggers, it’s hard to know if it’s just things that are just uncomfortable in general or actual triggers. And recently I started dissociating while hearing a song that I hadn’t listened to in a long time and I felt pretty sure that the song was the trigger. Then when I had done all the self-care and was feeling okay I listened to the song again as an experiment. Well nothing happened. Maybe the song isn’t  a trigger, or maybe it is but only when it takes me by surprise... who knows. 
I would like to see other people’s tips on this topic as well."
survivorsofabuse,eshdrkn,t3_c7p57m,1561990316.0,Same. Took me years to stop missing him. You are not alone.

Talk to your therapist about it!"
ptsd,eshcwdi,t1_esgek0p,1561989642.0,I also say “no” out loud! Never heard anyone else mention that. So glad I’m not alone.
rape,esas8pl,t1_esaihyc,1561767325.0,"I wish I had a good solution for that. Mostly distract myself with stupid shit like playing Minesweeper for hours. Not the healthiest habit but it could be worse. For me just realizing that I’m in a negative thought spiral is helpful, then I can tell myself “hey, this is just a spiral, I’ve been through this before, these thoughts are not my own, they aren’t real, it’s just brain chemistry, it will pass, just like last time.”
Something that sounds like a good idea (but that I haven’t tried yet) is to prepare a piece of paper with counterarguments that you can read when it gets bad. So if your negative thoughts tend to be “It was my fault”, you would write “It was not my fault”. Or “Nobody will ever love me” then you would write “I am loved by many people” etc. Obviously you write it when you are in a good mood, not when you’re already stuck in a loop. It’s like a letter from past you. 

Actually. I’ve been putting it off but I’m going to write mine right now. Thanks for the indirect inspiration :)"

survivorsofabuse,es8wbhi,t3_c6ene2,1561718201.0,I'm happy for you.
rapecounseling,es8w870,t3_c6f6z0,1561718072.0,"I've had this phase. It is absolutely exhausting to be angry all the time. My therapist helped me a lot with this, she explained that anger means destructive energy, so you have a lot of energy in you but you're not going to be able to use it to make something productive. But the energy has to get out some way, so find something that you can destroy with no consequence. I went into the woods and picked up big sticks and hit them around until they broke. I don't care if it sounds silly because it helped a lot."
ptsd,es8vphh,t1_es7ut10,1561717326.0,"Thank you for your reply.

I try not to get discouraged, but I would like to be able to predict my own reactions better. But yes grounding techniques are helping a lot. I'm often able to ground myself just by breathing out and saying the date, but I always carry ammonia inhalants for when nothing else helps."

I'm celebrating with you OP. There is hope for all of us."
rape,es7m9df,t3_c67d9l,1561674089.0,"I'm so sorry all this happened to you.

I think the same sometimes, and my therapist told me that yes, girls and women who experienced abuse are more likely to have it happen again, but it's not our fault in any way, it's just that many rapists are good at detecting people who are particularly vulnerable. This doesn't mean that we're weak or broken, just that at a particular time of our life our suffering made us more vulnerable."
rape,es7l7du,t3_c6bge3,1561673359.0,"You are not the reason that he molested other children. He was. He is the only one who can be blamed. 

When I found out that my rapist had raped others after me, I had this haunting thought that I was the first in a chain, that he had practiced on me, that by not telling and staying submissive I had taught him to do it, that he was like that because of me... until I found one victim who he abused even before me. Suddenly I realized that I would never think these things of her, even if she was the very first. 

You wouldn't think badly of another eight year old child for not telling. You wouldn't blame them. So don't blame yourself."
