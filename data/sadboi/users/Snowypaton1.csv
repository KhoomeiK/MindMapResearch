Do you miss being freezing? To the point that it‚Äôs a warm day and everyone is enjoying themselves but you can‚Äôt cause you just CANNOT. WARM. UP

do you miss that afternoon depression and mental fog that you get that comes with not eating all day 

Do you miss forgetting things all the time, not having the ability to think clearly, make positive decisions or remember important details cause your brain is starved

Do you miss not laughing, not being able to think of anything interesting to say, having all your personality consumed by this thing inside you 

Do you miss having your only achievements being that you have successfully starved your body? 

Do you miss feeling angry, sad and lonely for no reason 

Do you miss going through life feeling like you are sleepwalking 

Do you miss the bruises? The aged before their time joints? The thinning hair, the lanugo, the shitty nails, the inability to do anything for too long

Please know how much you are gaining from not fuelling what your eating disorder wants. I know it‚Äôs hard. I miss mine too. But you gotta remember that what you gain from recovering is so much more than just weight."

Exfoliate first it kinda softens the hair especially if it has an oil in it. then add soap or even conditioner and don‚Äôt use a blunt razor. Then after you get dry use a deodorant on the outside.
