HouseFlipper,fr1ecff,t1_fr1dopv,1589818232.0,Same :( it's just so frustrating to not even be able to play the game and losing all the progress. Even if I try an do a job it crashing after a minute or two. I'm also going to play sims but it's not as fun when I was hoping to play a dlc I paid almost 10 bucks for. Money was tight for me rn but I love house flipper and wanted some fun release. Guess that's not happening
HouseFlipper,fr1d700,t1_fr1d1r3,1589817650.0,That's where I'm at too :( I've tried going and grabbing a backup that was from before I bought the dlc but even that didn't return my house. I'm really disappointed about the dlc I heard so much great stuff but it just isn't working for me. Can't load anything and now my office is poor gone
Sims4,fqxts0t,t3_ga333s,1589737738.0,I'm still searching for a solution for this. I would really like to actually play the game offline with the dlc I've paid alot of money for. I'm kind of getting tired of EA to be honest. Never seem to fix the bugs they create

I know this is likely going to be the only house we can afford for a very long time. If we get an annoying neighbor we can't just move away. If I have to live in a neighborhood I would rather have no CC&Rs and not have some tyrant ruling the neighborhood. Sadly most the neighborhoods in my state are newer and full of CC&Rs so ones without are rare"
moving,fqarwb9,t1_fqaqb9d,1589224221.0,"I really fear CC&Rs, I've heard like soooo many horror stories. My friend was forced to give up their dog because the neighbor 'said' it was barking.

I'm aware I messed up alot by stopping the medicines just at the time(and even now) I was petrified of pills and they made/make me gag. When I was unable to see my rheumo anymore I kinda just let it happen because I didn't want more pills. Other things cropped up and I was busy with other Dr's so I let it happen.

SuggestALaptop,feaiycu,t1_feai9e4,1578949438.0,I'm really liking the look of the acer nitro 5 since 2 people have recommended it. I'm definitely going to start looking it up right now and looking at it myself.
SuggestALaptop,feagkle,t1_feagfe5,1578948508.0,"I know it's low but probably 500, I'm willing to look at ones up to 1000 because maybe I can save up for one as a dream computer. I'm also willing to look got the computer I want through like second hand situations if I can get it cheaper"
legaladvice,fds70jb,t1_fds65kp,1578695783.0,"Thank you for the link and the advice! So I should call the non emergency line first a few times before calling animal control? Next time it's in our field, which probably won't take long, I'm going to go out and get a video of it"
reactivedogs,fdnhe0h,t1_fdn4tj8,1578585849.0,I really do know it's the right thing to do just emotions really make everything worse... To think she won't be going on any of our annual camping trips this year is probably the hardest. We have a trip coming up in March and I'm just really not looking forward to it. Piper loves the beach and I know how hard it's gonna be for me to go to all the places I took her in her first year without her...
reactivedogs,fdnh1nv,t1_fdn4cf0,1578585637.0,I've gotten to the point where I'm extremely reluctant to tell anyone about what's going on... Even when I got piper a few people crapped on me saying it was a bad idea. There's few people I trust not to be jerks... My sister used to be one of the people that was rude about me deciding to rehome/surrender her. But she eventually realized I had done everything in my power to make it work but it wasn't working. I really tried to rehome her first hoping she'd go straight into a loving home. But I realized she needs some more work and an organization that'll make sure she gets put in the right home.
reactivedogs,fdngm6x,t1_fdmvizc,1578585378.0,"I'm in the same boat crying hysterically, I hate crying and I almost never do. But when it comes to my dogs I break down. I know I'm going to ball like a baby but I don't want to, I want to take her there in a happy fun mood so she doesn't get scared..."
reactivedogs,fdmjzu5,t1_fdmjmzs,1578552728.0,"Logically I've reached that conclusion... After the close call I had a week ish ago it was like reality stabbed me in the back. That no matter how hard I tried, no matter how many workarounds I found, etc it just wasn't working for anyone. Emotionally I'm just so broken, I rescued piper from a disgusting situation, she was infested with worms, eating her own poop, etc. I took her and got her healthy again, I've had puppies before obviously but she was the one I spent the most one on one time really working on her and getting her healthy. I also got her(also a few months after I got pip) right after 2 of my other dogs died(they were poisoned long story) so I got extremely attached to her as a way to cope with the loss of my babies. She helped me through a dark time and i couldn't do the same for her.."
reactivedogs,fdmjloq,t1_fdmgqco,1578552293.0,"Thank you, just hearing some kind words helps... Ive dealt with so many nasty comments from people all around me during this process that it was just starting to get to me. I tried everything to make it work but it ultimately came down to making a choice between my piper and my pip. It was a decision I never thought I would have to make and it broke me to 'choose' pip. So many people told me I should just have gotten rid of pip since he was 'clearly the problem' which didn't help whatsoever. I don't know why and don't think I'll ever understand her pure hatred for my dog pip. It's honestly scary, she's fearful reactive to all other dogs but with pip she's...obessive and growls like I've never seen a dog growl before... Even the trainer I took her to couldn't understand why a switch flipped as soon as she saw pip"
reactivedogs,fdmjd3y,t1_fdm5wn9,1578552033.0,"Thank you so much for the kind words, they're honestly really helpful. Logically I know it's silly to be upset when this is the best for piper and I want her to have the best life. I'm just trying to get past the emotional part and the fears of what might happen to her. I know she'll likely and hopefully be find and find a more suitable loving home but I'm still petrified about her getting someone whose not willing to work with her and just dumps her off somewhere... I would give anything for her to have a happy home for the rest of her life"
thesims,fckwxis,t1_fcku65d,1577734958.0,I've seen but I was wondering how it works? Like how do you use it?
