premed,fpoeeax,t3_geki6l,1588783093.0,"I get exactly where you're coming from. Mental health issues are increasingly acknowledged in medicine, but I think there's definitely a difference in perception of garden-variety depression/anxiety versus other more ""severe"" mental illnesses. 

 Many medical schools have psychologists on staff; it's confidential and these people are generally not involved with teaching/grading in any way. Several schools also offer psychiatry services. However, if you are really concerned about confidentiality and feel uncomfortable with being prescribed meds by a school faculty member, you could always look into psychiatrists who are not affiliated with the school--private practices, especially those that offer a sliding-scale fee, may be a good option. Point is, there are options to get treatment in medical school, and you should definitely take them.

It's true that mental illness is seen as a red flag by many residencies. However, reporting laws vary by state. In many states, you would not be required to disclose a diagnosis unless you recently received inpatient treatment. So don't worry too much about that just yet."
preppers,fm4nnoq,t1_fm1ulfi,1585757465.0,"This is insane. A family medicine doctor with rural/unopposed/full-scope residency training could fulfill the roles of the vet/paramedic/doula (guessing you mean midwife). Someone with this training would be able to deliver babies (including C-sections) and perform basic surgeries like appendectomies and cholecystectomies. They would also have a broader scope of medical knowledge than any of the people you mentioned. Granted, not *every* family physician has this degree of training. But if you could find one who went through a full-scope residency, you'd be better off than with the combo you listed."

college,fkhqay8,t3_fidju9,1584203972.0,"Hey there! I've been where you are and I know how hard it can be. I'm listing some things that have helped me, forgive me if it's disorganized.

\-I make a daily or weekly to-do list, but I include some things that are already done to make me feel like I've already made progress. For instance, I might have a list that goes: ~~take meds~~, ~~go to the gym~~, finish lab report, buy groceries...

\-I schedule breaks for myself. Sometimes that means alternating 30 minutes of working on something with 30 minutes of lying in bed doing nothing. The important thing is to keep going forward. 

\-I break up my work into manageable chunks. Instead of saying, ok I'm going to write this paper today, I might say: from 11-12 I'm going to look up and bookmark sources, from 1-2 I'm going to skim the sources and take notes, from 2:30-3:30 I'm going to write the introduction, etc.

\-This may or may not work for you depending on what kind of classes you're taking, but if it's something that involves a lot of memorization, I copy-paste sections of my notes into Anki flashcards. Even if I can't focus well, seeing the information over and over does usually help me retain it.

\-I have a dry-erase calendar board on my wall. At the beginning of the month, I write down *everything*: homework assignments, tests, quizzes, projects, meetings, etc. If I don't do this, I *will* forget when things are due.

\-Idk if you're into exercise, but I go to the gym first thing in the morning, before class or anything else. It forces me to get out of my apartment and do something ""productive"", but it's not as taxing as schoolwork."

I don't have actual data on this, but two pieces of info:

1. I work at a large hospital which does not yet have confirmed COVID-19 cases. We have multiple ICUs (e.g. medical, neuro, etc.) which are at or near capacity. Idk about ventilator use, but I imagine the situation is similar.
2. University of Washington Medicine is going to postpone elective (aka, non-emergent) surgeries starting next week. This is almost certainly to free up ICU beds and vents."

I was accepted to an out-of-state school, and if I end up going there, I would hope to establish care with a psychiatrist who is NOT affiliated with the medical school. Post-residency, licensing/disclosure requirements are decided at the state level, and that will probably affect where I end up long term. There are a few states with ""mental-health friendly"" boards which don't ask about mental illness at all. A number of other states only ask about *uncontrolled*/*untreated* illnesses, which hopefully will not apply to me at that time. What I'm going for is don't ask, don't tell."

BipolarReddit,f3wbywu,t1_f3w3fry,1571197295.0,"Honestly, most of the things that got me this far are very situational. I've really been lucky as far as the timing of my episodes and how well treatment has been working, but here are some other things that helped:

\- Small, supportive major at a large public school. Small major meant that my professors and advisor got to know me very personally. They helped get me mental healthcare when I desperately needed it, and wrote meaningful letters of recommendation when I ultimately applied to med school. Large public school = more mental health and other resources. If you're not in a similar program, try to take as many small classes/classes with the same professor as possible.

\- Mentors! I've gotten an incredible amount of career and life advice from a psychiatrist at my school (not my psychiatrist!). His faith that I would be able to make it through medical school despite my history gave me confidence to apply. But this doesn't have to be someone in medicine necessarily--just someone outside of your family/friends/treatment team who you trust and who can give you advice.

\- A good MCAT score can go a long way in making up for other academic blips/withdrawals/etc. I happened to study for and take the exam during one of my most stable periods, and did well. If you're anywhere close to taking the MCAT, I can give you advice separately on that.

Other advice:

\- Balancing extracurriculars and school is HARD, and I was often unsuccessful at it. I started a billion activities and projects when I was hypomanic and dropped them all when I was depressed. Creating a coherent application from that mess was a challenge. Don't be me. Pick ONE thing, maybe volunteering a couple of hours a week at a low-stress organization. If you can handle it, add another. If not, see the next point!

\- Don't be afraid to take gap years. I think most students do these days.  Looking at my record, it would have probably been a wiser choice to spend a year or two working and building up my application before applying. It ended up working out for me, but again, I think I got very lucky. 

&#x200B;

But full disclosure. I have never experienced full mania. I have never been truly psychotic, only some mild hallucinations that were probably more to do with extended sleep deprivation than anything else. Both of those things would have made my journey much, much harder."
BipolarReddit,f2twkao,t3_de6ety,1570401542.0,"Yes yes yes. This is absolutely me. I'm in college and I've honestly lost track of everything I've started and then failed to follow through on. So many opportunities lost, so many bridges burned. I physically cringe thinking back about some of it. 

At one point I was volunteering with an ESL program and for the first couple of weeks I was coming in with lesson plans, activities, going way above and beyond what was expected of me. Then...hit a bad depression and completely ghosted, literally just never went back. They were calling me to ask what happened, if I was okay, and I couldn't pick up the phone. Sucks because I really enjoyed it and would love to go back and volunteer there but I can't face any of them again. Later on I was working in a research lab--same story. For the first six months or so, I was everyone's favorite student, my PI was delighted with how fast I could pick up on things and get them done, and I was on track to publish some of my own research. Then, bam depression--can't focus, work quality goes down the drain, miss deadlines...by the end of the next semester I'm basically fired. I tend to be really ""up"" around the start of the school year and I always join half a dozen different clubs and organizations, volunteer for everything, join every random committee I can...then I crash and I'm gone, no one hears from me again. I don't even want to think about how many professional commitments I've broken at this point, and that's not even getting into the innumerable personal relationships I've destroyed due to being wildly inconsistent. All things considered I've done pretty well but wow, if I could only manage to stick with even half the stuff I start..."
