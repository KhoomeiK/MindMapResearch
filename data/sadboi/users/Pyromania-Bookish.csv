SuicideWatch,fb9aw9y,t1_fb9ah6a,1576633857.0,Oop don’t go lower or else you’ll be giving Brackman and Parrish a run for their money. You’re making yourself look desperate.
SuicideWatch,fb9adpt,t3_ec1q23,1576633476.0,"You really don’t see how you’ve tried to ruin others lives. Sad. That really shows immaturity and not having self awareness. Spencer is right. And so is everyone else who told me this. You’re manipulative and only give a shit about what you can get out of a situation. Fool me once shame on me. Fool me twice shame on you. God, I  couldn’t believe you could stoop any lower. I guess I was wrong but I’m not making that mistake again."
SuicideWatch,fb2l3s2,t3_eau5or,1576453021.0,Thank you to everyone who commented and gave advice. I am actually going to talk to my mom when she gets home in a few hours. Thanks for listening.
lonely,fajviyx,t1_faj796a,1576155558.0,Thanks. It’s just kind of disconcerting for people to see them along with the rest of me cause it’ll mess them up if they look too fast.
lonely,faj6fc8,t3_e9iqyg,1576125864.0,"I don’t even participate in my school activities but I still have to take pictures sadly. My parents are trying to shove me into the world with people my age because I have depression and they can’t see that this is the last thing that I need since I have social anxiety, panic disorder, people claustrophobia, and I’m an extreme introvert. Being able to refuse year book pictures sounds like a nice thing."

SuicideWatch,f9t1jfj,t1_f9pw4uk,1575606023.0,"That’s kinda hard when I have extremely severe social anxiety, panic disorder (related to social situations), and I was bullied my whole life. It’s just not that simple for me. I’ve found solace in being alone with my books and I’m ok with that. I’ve learned to not expect much from people and I’m ok with that as well. I honestly feel that I have a better experience in my life when my friends are limited to family members and book characters. Thanks for the suggestion, though."
highthoughts,f9mnrkc,t3_e5trss,1575465802.0,The only problem is that electrons are needed to observe an atom. Atoms will automatically move away from electrons and electron microscopes are the only possible way to observe atoms. I just read a book about this. Read Cult X by Fuminori Nakamura and there are explanations on everything from consciousness to the origin of the universe.

SuicideWatch,f9io9zd,t3_e2rgbz,1575341996.0,She wants to pump me full of artificial serotonin. Not ducking happening cause that would be facilitating my “self destructive thoughts/behavior”
SuicideWatch,f9io420,t3_e5af3b,1575341879.0,I’ll remember you for your brave fight with your demons. Well all see each other again. Whether it be in this life or as atoms trying to build themselves a human.
SuicideWatch,f9inzbb,t3_e594oz,1575341788.0,Yo I’m just commenting and posting.
SuicideWatch,f9inxdy,t3_e55wmw,1575341748.0,I’ll remember anyone who knows what it’s like to experience and fight the human condition.
SuicideWatch,f9inqz8,t1_f9infgd,1575341619.0,Same here. My therapist recommended meds as a possibility and I was just thinking umm.... that would take away my comfort in thinking about how I want to return to the universe so I’m gonna pass.
SuicideWatch,f9inbj8,t1_f9ilt1c,1575341316.0,Exactly. My parents would lose their shit of they saw into my head but they’ll never figure it out because they haven’t even bothered to look. I have to talk to my doctor tomorrow about my “contemplating death” “problem” which is bull shit and they just want to find a reason to get me on meds or send me to the funny house.
SuicideWatch,f9in2xr,t3_e4vvro,1575341144.0,If your parents can’t see that your battle with being human isn’t serious enough then they need some perspective. I’m in this human battle too and I’ll stand by your side. ❤️
SuicideWatch,f9iljxk,t3_e2rgbz,1575340072.0,Same here. And thanks for understand for me as well. I’m in that same room with you and I can’t decide what to do. My parents won’t leave me alone because my therapist said being alone isn’t good for me. She finally realized that I have major depression and obsession problems even though I’ve been seeing her since August. She tore my life apart in an hour and a half and my parents want to know what’s going on but want to stick me in the loony bin if I have any major problems that I’m not telling them about (which I do) at the same time. They keep asking me how I’m doing and I keep saying”I’m fine” and they don’t bother to pursue it further. Sometimes they ask multiple times and I always think “IF YOU WANT A DIFFERENT ANSWER THEN QUIT ASKING!!!” But I keep saying I’m fine when my mind is trying to destroy itself from the inside out.
SuicideWatch,f9iky4e,t3_dzbmgc,1575339654.0,I’m with you on that. I sit on the bottom of the pool during the summer as long as I can and just let the water flow into my ears. It’s so peaceful and quiet that I never want to leave but inevitably I float back to the surface before anything can happen. I can’t become stardust just yet since I have people to hang on to and only one who really understands. Thanks for being there for me. I’ll be there for you even if you don’t want me to and you shouldn’t take crap about thinking the way you do. Our consciousness is made of a certain combination of atoms and not by accident.
Davie504,f98c10r,t1_f94zc1t,1575176451.0,That’s my grandmother’s birthday. RIP he was such a good artist. I love LP it sucks that they can’t release anymore songs.

SuicideWatch,f85ibls,t3_dz4clc,1574275862.0,Until we meet again and for some it may be sooner than others but we’ll see you there. You are strong no matter what you believe for staying this long.
SuicideWatch,f85i72t,t1_f8576je,1574275785.0,I don’t know who the hell you think you are but you obviously aren’t a legitimate part of this community. The only reason why’re you’re saying that is because you don’t know what it’s like. That person would feel like this if depression was just a “cold”. I suggest you pick your ass up and leave this subreddit and find a community that actually puts up with this bullshit.
SuicideWatch,f84r6mv,t1_f84qowz,1574258603.0,I’m an atheist but i don’t have much of a conscience. I have just never understood the need to believed in a higher power because your life is what you make of it not someone else. Some things can’t be explained because we can’t humanly explain them. We can’t just assume that there is an afterlife because no one knows and everyone’s so closed minded that they will only accept the option that is easiest to understand.
SuicideWatch,f84l8mg,t1_f83pf8f,1574253288.0,I’m an atheist so I don’t get why people do things for god. If someone claims that god is made up of pure love then why are we here. god is not a sentient being and I don’t think anyone could tell me other wise. Ive just never agreed with the fact that someone who can allegedly create miracles would just stand by and watch genocide. We’re all human and that’s what we’re afraid of. That there really is no afterlife and once you’re gone you’re gone and humans being the greedy narcissists that we are don’t want to die because we still want more in this life and have as many people remember us as well. There is equality among humans because we are all just human. No matter what size shape or form we’re still human and that won’t change and some people just can’t accept that like when gay marriage wasn’t legal because it was deemed wrong. Everyone thinks that being gay or trans or depressed is a choice. It’s not because it’s extra baggage from being human. And you can’t choose that.
SuicideWatch,f83otci,t1_f83o1tf,1574217046.0,"Except humans are the least objective species. We can’t really make any decisions that don’t have some sort of personal involvement. The term “a jury of your peers” is a load of bull because even though people say they don’t have opinions on a certain topic, there isn’t a topic the people have some sort of opinion or bias on and that is basically the root of our society. If you know or talk to people who have opinions or have some sort of access to anything that has information then you can throw you hopes of objective morality out a speeding car. And exactly with the whole murder thing this is exactly why we have pleas of self defense or defense of another. Like in A Time to Kill by John Grisham. An African American man kills two white men because they raped his daughter and it is obviously the defense of another but no one can get past the fact that he is not white and that crimes committed by a non-white man on a man that is white is automatically going to have a biased jury because of implicit bias cause juries are gonna have at least one thick skilled white man on a jury. I know I’m rambling and kinda got off topic, but that being said nobody can decide what is right or wrong because everyone has committed at least one wrong in their life and some wrongs are bigger than others. The world isn’t two dimensional or black and white. Is three dimensional in shades of grey. Justice isn’t blind and it can see a whole lot more than we can."
SuicideWatch,f83nqnz,t1_f83gys2,1574216254.0,That’s the downside to having a conscience. It tells you what’s “wrong” about your actions which is only the moral absolution that’s been shoved down your throat your whole life. What is wrong or right and who gets to decide can’t be decided by someone who is as human as us.
AnorexiaNervosa,f833w0v,t1_f833fxa,1574203815.0,Exactly like look in the mirror before you make a comment about something like that dude. Jesus as MJ said “I’m staring with the man in the mirror. “
AnorexiaNervosa,f8338tc,t1_f7meuor,1574203426.0,I was hella mad about that cause I’ve been called fat my whole life by people who always had the perfect bodies and perfect lives and could eat whatever they want and look the same the next day. The person who said that was probably the one who didn’t need to be exclusively thinking about other people. If you get what I mean. She ain’t the healthiest person we know.
SuicideWatch,f832uu8,t1_f8317rs,1574203195.0,Yeah. Isn’t it about this guy who tries to commit the perfect murder or something like that?
SuicideWatch,f83142n,t1_f80qw86,1574202162.0,Shout out to my friend u/just-kinda-existing for not looking at me with disgust when I talk about wanting to end it all and wanting to jump off buildings and $#!+. They’re the only person I know who understands the symptoms of the human condition.
SuicideWatch,f830nup,t1_f80qw86,1574201900.0,"Oh yes, the only thing I would regret was not reading enough before ending it all. There’s so much to reading so I may end up living my life with books cause that’s all I really need. My best friends are book characters and I have one friend that gets what it’s like to be human."
SuicideWatch,f830g0o,t1_f80w0nb,1574201774.0,I’ve heard crime and punishment is good as well. I haven’t gone through all of the Stephen king books either so that’ll keep me for a while.
SuicideWatch,f80lo11,t1_f80ijxf,1574132030.0,This sounds like the adult version of me. Bullied my whole life. Depressed since the age of five. No friends or beyond friend relationships and I’m still considering ending it all on a daily basis and dreaming about jump off of overpasses or hanging myself from the ceiling fan. Or slicing my arteries. What is really stopping me. Nothing except I’m too much of a coward to actually do it and I have too many books left too read. 😅
