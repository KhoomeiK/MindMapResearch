If you check my post history you'll see I am working on getting government support, and was recently declared eligible for the Department of Vocational Rehabilitation. So I'll be getting government aid in finding a job. But I had applied to over 100 different jobs that I would be capable of working in at the time of posting this and only a handful of them replied back, and only 2 of them were for interviews. But I didn't get a single one.
And yes, I came up with ways it wouldn't work. That's what i had to do growing up, everything had to be perfect. But it wasn't meant as a way of turning people down, I was seeing it as a ""but what about this"" reasoning. This sounds good, but this part of my life gets in the way, what should I do about that. How should I go around doing this, while I don't have any support or assistance. 
I have autism, and severe social anxiety, along with depression. Fixing my attitude isn't the issue. I do everything I can to get a job, and work my ass off at it. It may not be at the level most people would consider hard working, but it's difficult for me to even work at a neurotypical person's level for a day. If you don't have a mental disorder, then don't even try to judge me, let alone consider looking down on me. You would never know how hard it is just to get by day to day without some kind of support."
