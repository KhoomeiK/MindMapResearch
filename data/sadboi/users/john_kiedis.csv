phenibut,fmjn10t,t1_fmjlw0m,1586133620.0,"Yeah, it's like when people insist that you can't feel ""high"" from it. Like as if their experience must be the exact same for everyone. 

Perfect example of people responding differently to the same substance is alcohol. One person can have a few drinks and feel relaxed and chatty and the person next to them can do the same and wants to fight everyone."

Soundgarden,eq9bxl5,t1_eq9b2cc,1559898813.0,"Yeah totally. To be honest, i remember thinking back in 2011 and listening to blow up the outside world and thinking to myself ""hmm, i wonder if anyone close to Chris ever asked him if he was ok. Because going off the lyrics you can tell he had gone through dark times"" but then again i guess its easy to say ""its only a song, not real life.

It was really hard for the first few months after he died because his music at the time made up about 25% of everything i listened to. And i would get really emotional when i heard him."

phenibut,eq3oqf6,t1_eq27ooo,1559760056.0,"Yes Ive used valium and xanax. 

Im not sure if you mean how they compare to Phenibut or to this gaba/lemon balm product so ill answer both:

Phen doesn't really compare to benzos for me. Phen usually feels like I have zero anxiety and gernerally more confident. Pleasent bodliy sensations.

Whereas benzos make me feel like i have less anxiety but i also dont give a shit about anything and my body in kinda a little numb.

Gaba/lemon balm product (lemon-aid 714) is kinda a lot like phen but just way less intense. Not as 'in your face' as phen can sometimes be."
phenibut,eq0nfcs,t1_epzxthw,1559689154.0,"Yeah that the product. It did originally contain Phenibut but they since have started using gaba. 

Honestly, i had the same thought that there just saying it gaba. But idk, it seems really risky saying that its one thing when its actually another. Ive noticed they've distanced themselves from Phenibut ever been a part of it. Deleting comments on fb that asked about phen and if gaba is even effective.

But having used it, although similar to phen. It just feels different. Hard to explain but it doesn't feel like phen to me."
Nirvana,epy709g,t1_epy4yk1,1559621542.0,"Just had a listen. Yeah your right, the riff is similar."
Anxiety,ep9xskz,t1_ep98phf,1559118153.0,"Yes, I know the guilty feeling. In the past ive worked part-time and i was so much happier."
Anxiety,ep9xihg,t1_ep97k9y,1559118006.0,"Thank you for your reply. I don't work on weekends. I do have hobbies I enjoy (gym, tennis and art) but the problem is that i spend pretty much all my downtime getting over work. Like weekend's im wiped out Saturday and by Sunday afternoon im just feeling a little energetic i have to start thinking about work again.

So i guess my point is, thats not much of a life but if i wanted to live on my own id have to be working full-time to afford it. I have worked part time in the past but i couldn't afford to be on a part-time wage if i was on my own. If that makes sense."

HealthAnxiety,eo8xf2d,t1_eo8e5th,1558377012.0,Blood in his stools was the first symptom. Then from there he got test done.
