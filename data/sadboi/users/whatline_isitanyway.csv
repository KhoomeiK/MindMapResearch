&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 So this happened like a week ago as of me writing this.

 But basically I’m at a Walmart with my mom. When I go to pretty much any store I tend to spilt up with the person I’m there with. 

Now to the story, as the title says I’m 13 but have a relatively deep voice and some would say defined facial features. I’m also wearing jeans and a blue shirt, but not the employee vest. 

So I’m casually in the LEGO aisle just looking around at some cool legos, though I’m not really into them, when I hear an “excuse me.” I turn to look and what I see is the ABSOLUTE DEFINITION OF KAREN. I say “uhh, yeah.” puzzled as to what’s happening. EM says “are you going to help me or what.” That’s when I realize what’s going on.

I was pretty excited cause I had been watching [r/slash](https://www.reddit.com/r/slash/) on YouTube and watched a bunch of the [r/idontworkherelady](https://www.reddit.com/r/idontworkherelady/) videos. Great channel by the way, check him out.

 Before I can say anything EM calls me useless and says “this is why you’re working at Walmart for 10 bucks an hour.” Idk. The first thing I say is “I don’t work here Karen.” And then,”Even if I did work here you’re sorry ass would be the last person I’d help.” She stands there with her jaw dropped like a loony tune. EM finally comes back down to earth and says practically screaming at the top of her lungs,”that is no way to treat a paying customer” and drops the oh so classic ”let me speak to the manager.” To which I say, ”do you see a vest on me? Do I have a name tag? Lady for the last time, I don’t work here” she calls me a liar and brings up her husband and two kids again. She says that I assaulted her. Idk and wtf. He is 100 times better than her and FOTY says “umm, I don’t think so.” To which then EM says that “he won’t get the manager.” blah blah blah. FOTY just says “that’s cause he doesn’t work here.” 

You know that fuzzy pulsing feeling you get when something shocking but good happens, that’s what happened with me. Finally only one entitled parent and not both.

 She takes a look at me still not getting a clue and says, “but he’s wearing a uniform.” To which FOTY responds ”that’s not the uniform."" 

By then an actual employee shows up, and a couple of  bystanders, I think like 4 or 5. 

The employee says, ”what’s going on?”  So EM says, ”that worker won’t help find what I’m looking for.”

 Keep in mind, she hasn’t even told me what she was looking for. 

The employee says, ”uhh, ma’am, he doesn’t work here.” 

Her kids were at this point trying not to look in my direction probably embarrassed. EM tries to make up a lie on the spot but comes out with this instead, ”he just hid his vest and name tag somewhere to try and embarrass me.” I can’t make this shit up. That’s when I start losing it, I just start laughing at what she just said. She screams, breaking my eardrums, ”DONT LAUGH AT ME.” That’s when her kids leave to another aisle.

 My mom made her way over and realizes what’s going on and says, ”This is my son.” I now see Karen lose all color from her face and try to mutter something before yanking on her husbands arm trying to get the hell out of there. Her kids follow but way behind trying not to be matched with them. My mom just asks, ”did she touch you?” To which I say no. Everybody starts to just leave so we do to. As we’re paying we see Karen again and she gives me the classic Karen death stare and I never see her again. This is going to be heard by all classmates of once school starts up. I hate Karen."

For 15 straight days, he'd harass me. Destroy my artwork, smack me around, follow me home, pull my hair, call me racial slurs. Every single time he did, I'd march to the front office in near tears and file an incident report, this \*was\* a zero tolerance school after all.

Think this got the problems taken care of? No.

My principal hated me for some reason and she advised the School Psychologist and the Vice Principal that any and all issues that had my name in them or the names of my relatives were to be dealt with by her and her only. 

Her solution? Place him in another of my classes because I was ""clearly"" just being difficult. I was bookish, nerdy, kept to myself due to past bullying and was quiet but not anti-social. I wasn't being difficult. He was a fucking bitch.

On the 16th day, after homeroom I went to my first period, Art, with a new teacher, Ms. Smith. I really liked her. It was a free period in art so I wanted to work on some sketches ( I still can't draw or paint worth a damn but I enjoy it). 

Angel (the motherfucker was \*NOT\* angelic at all) and two of his friends, Raudel & Alfredo (fuck both of you, if you're reading this) were picking on me incessantly. They had moved to my table just to pick on me and Ms. Smith asked me if I wanted to move. 

""Is it really fair for me to move from my table because they came over here to mess with me?""

""No, but I'm not sure what else to suggest""

Well, me either, Ms. Smith.

Reader, have you ever been black out angry? Well, when you're 12, you just got your first period, you've been bullied terribly for what feels like forever and someone tells you they aren't scared of a stupid black bitch, sometimes you just snap. Even his friends had told him they hadn't seen me this angry and he should stop. He didn't. I finished. 

I smashed his head into the wooden table and when it bounced off of the table, I grabbed him by his stupid little neck and dragged him to the middle of the classroom and watched his face change colors. Pink, red, purple, blue. When Ms. Smith started to cry and he started to flail around, I dropped him onto the cement because my school was too cheap for hardwood or carpeted flooring. 

He cried and went to punch me and I went for him again.

The principal handed it terribly and I am nowhere near as angry as a person but he never bullied me again."

TrueOffMyChest,fha9y4z,t1_fha80sv,1581401773.0,I'm not entirely sure. The 10 years you can go without getting pregnant I guess is too lengthy of an option for me to have

Most states are like this, my state is considered lenient because you're not ""required"" to have a man's permission but most doctors will still want one. It varies from state to state but in general, they don't seem to trust women to make decisions about their own autonomy. 


I tried to get an IUD because high estrogen birth control makes me vomit profusely and worsens my migraines and they refused. 

The implant worsened my depression and made me gain weight that was worsening conditions I already have and they tried to make me keep it an additional two years. 


Planned Parenthood has been my saving grace and even then it's still difficult. Especially with low or no insurance. 



For example, my mother died in labor three times and has sickle cell anemia and is allergic to the epidural and they wouldn't tie her tubes because she was unmarried and ""what if her future husband wanted more kids""
She had five. No more.
Then when they finally tied her tubes, they botched the procedure and she had a miscarriage a few months later. On birth control."

Also, who assaulted him?"
