They ended up divorced and I was slightly heartbroken about my dad but one of the most important things in the world to me was my cat scarlet and I Had to leave her.. One reason why I'm depressed is because after me and my sisters and my mom moved somewhere else without my dad I found out I was allergic to cats... When I was down I would go to my cat scarlet and I would hug her and pet her so much she was the best thing in my life, now I can't.
