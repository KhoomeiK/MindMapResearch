Anxiety,fpuaqcg,t3_gfhkcd,1588908423.0,I legit think this is why I have extreme mood swings. Like. Everything will be great one minute then my anxiety kicks in by one little comment I or someone else makes. I start over thinking and then I just. Lose my shit. Like. I can’t even control it. It just happens and I don’t realize it until after.
Aquariums,fpp86oa,t1_fpolyld,1588797634.0,I updated with a comment
Aquariums,fpp83t7,t3_gen5ue,1588797596.0,So I ended up cutting on the angles with a dremel. Worked that out by cutting the silicone in the corners side to side. Then pulled hard. Like. Really hard. Tried numerous ways to remove the front part of the acrylic. No go. I ended up using pliers to break it apart. The. The glass I used a razor carefully on each spot they were siliconed and wala. I think it took just about four hours total but that was a lot of me standing there going wth. Oh. And be careful for anyone that tries. The glass dividers are sharp and cut deep quite fast. My hand and wrist are cut up but I’m done.
Aquariums,fpoqlt3,t1_fpolyld,1588788965.0,My hands are small but still pretty beat up. I can’t quite get in the corner so I think an xacto blade might be a better option
Aquariums,fpopqqv,t1_fpolyld,1588788545.0,Shortly after posting a friend said dremel out the acrylic. So that’s what I’m doing. I’ll let you know how it works. I’ve the the two angled sides off in about half an hour and three cut off disks. Just came in for a razor to get the edges of the rest and it should be probably another hour
JustNoSO,fmlcg9c,t3_fvuob0,1586183595.0,"Ask her what you can do to help? Tell her you don’t know what she needs right now because you guys aren’t communicating it. Have her shower and you do naps for a week. See how things go so she can relax. Then do some of her work and get a little break from nap time. That seems to be where the issue starts. For mine I admit I’ve been stressed being a single mom. So yesterday my boyfriend got butt duty when my son pooped(not his kid but he was super willing even though he didn’t want to, mines 4). They had a talk about how neither of them really wanted him to wipe him and that seemed to help and my son let him. It’s a struggle because at his dads house he said he’s not wiped. So I am literally the only one that wipes him and slowly working on other people helping him"

Then added that part because nobody’s gonna say right away they are pretty sure they have it. So it’s best to keep everyone away if possible
JustNoSO,fmfvaxq,t3_fuvknl,1586035586.0,So I talked with my lawyer and I was told i have to abide by the court order. So today he was here and then said he’s pretty sure they all have covid. All being. His mom. His fling. Their twins his sister and him. All in a 2 br 900 square foot house. But. It doesn’t matter because it’s his time.

AskParents,fmf9r8y,t1_fmefvcg,1586022776.0,Mine is four. He’s always asking why. Why do I want him to try going to the bathroom? Generally my answer is. You’re wiggling or dancing so I’d like you to try so there is no accident. Why do I want him to not scream in my ear? Because i value my hearing. Why  do I want him to stop throwing toys? Because they could break. Why do I want him to eat at the table? Because I don’t want larder beetles in my bedroom. The list goes on. I’m sure there will be more that get harder to answer

Unless you’re handing it to me or I asked you to put it somewhere, don’t fucking touch my meds. I’m on birth control and bupropion. My boyfriend knows about both and when he’s around does really good about reminding me to take it. He has touched my bup once. My birth control he will pick up from the pharmacy. That’s the extent he touches them. Nobody else does. Honestly. I’d sit her down. Tell her your mental health is where you draw the line. Any other pranks are okay, but that you’re really not happy with this recent one and you’d rather she held off for awhile."
cheating_stories,fm87eg9,t1_fm86yww,1585844199.0,It’s not you. It’s them. That I can promise you. For the longest time I blamed myself. It took an almost three year break for me to realize I wasn’t the problem. I just chose shitty people. They lied. Tricked me. And that’s not my fault for wanting to believe they were good guys. They lied to me to think they were.
cheating_stories,fm82wg0,t3_ftfs9x,1585841785.0,"I know how you’re feeling. And it does get better. I was cheated on in my first two relationships. Both were shit. Now I have someone amazing and I know without a doubt he loves me. He has eyes for only me. I haven’t wondered in about 4 months if he’s ever going to cheat. We’ve been together almost 10. I trust him 100%. First time I was cheated on was 2011. Second 2014. Same with the third. The fourth and fifth times were in 2015. The last four I was pregnant. I didn’t find out about the last two until last year though. The first two I found the messages and he ran to Texas for two weeks. Refused to explain or anything. His answer to the messages of her waiting in bed for him? “She’s crazy and I’m not sleeping with her”. Basically. They fucked up and lost someone loyal as fuck and that’s on them. It’s never our faults when we are cheated on. I beat myself up for years, but it’s all on them for cheating.   You will come out stronger in the end. It might take time. Basically. Don’t give up hope. Someone will realize your worth and do nothing that would hurt you. And she will be perfect. You will never doubt her. You will know you can trust her. And you will be inexplicably happy."

I can’t take him to the store. My Walmart only gives me same day or next day option for grocery pick up(some local women say they can see out two weeks in theirs and nothing is available). Idk what to even do and I’m on the verge of just losing control on everything. I can’t order online as online I can’t use foodstamps. I get 240 a month for support. I’m in a dark place mentally.

raisedbynarcissists,flxvkra,t3_frqb8n,1585590652.0,Wait. What’s his email. I’m a single parent of an amazing but sassy 4 year old who’s dad isn’t in the picture other than child support and a few hours every other weekend. He’s also a narcissist so single parent was easier. I mean. I have an amazing boyfriend. But free money I think he’d be okay with this lol
COVID19positive,flvy4ab,t3_frd5il,1585534883.0,So to be honest. I’ve been like this for about a week. Physically drained. Cough. Occasionally my lungs are basically going. What the fuck don’t forget to breathe. Reading comments my resting heart rate when I first wake up(thanks Fitbit) is usually right around 80-84.my sinuses were really congested yesterday and the day before. But also really dry and had nonstop nosebleeds last night. I had diarrhea for a few days at the beginning of this exhaustion but passed all this off as a med I started just about a month ago(March 4th I believe) now I’m wondering if these horrid headaches are more than dehydration.
AskParents,flvxfrg,t3_fr7y7n,1585534412.0,So. With mine who’s four now...I look at him. He will say he’s crabby. And I’ll be all. Oh. We gotta tickle the cranky away. He always laughs. When I stop he’s still a crank. So I’m like oh. You’re still crabby. I have to tickle you again. Eventually he says I’m not cranky anymore or whatever mood he was in. Just getting him to laugh really helps
relationship_advice,flvwugq,t1_flv5vq7,1585534001.0,This. My first thought is. Divorce. Show your daughter cheating never ends well. Show her that you know you deserve to be treated well. Loved. Children model us.

AskParents,flvprdk,t3_frcj6g,1585529229.0,I always hear my boyfriend out. My 4 year old loves him. Basically. My boyfriend is fun “parent” because I’m the rule setter. He only need enforce them. So what I would do in your shoes is step back. Don’t rush moving in yet. Wait awhile.
JustNoSO,fluyuju,t1_fluynlw,1585512869.0,Oh I know. My ex was this way. I realized being military just reinforced it and made it worse than it was. I only knew him after discharge but his mom and sister both said it changed him for the worse. He admitted to everyone he enlisted so he could be killed. Got sent to Korea instead and the fact it wasn’t Iraq apparently wrecked everything for him so he basically just hates the world now.
JustNoSO,fluwfvm,t3_fr5ohe,1585511461.0,"Flip side. Him controlling could be partially due to deployment and not being able to control his own life. Told to do everything pretty much. Now he wants to have control and doesn’t care who it is. I’d tell him get help now, and you’d consider staying there a little longer. But not more than a year because you mentally just. Can’t. If he doesnt seek help in the next day. Three months, you know his decision."

AskParents,flqzoe9,t3_fqbsp5,1585409863.0,Oh. I lost my shit and full on rage when mine was about 16 weeks. Sleep regression. I never ever hurt him or thought about it either. I was essentially a single mom from the day he was brought home til now. He’s 4. I found wearing him worked the best because he was near me and would be almost. Delirious. I used the boba wrap because it was much more comfortable. And being near him really helped me not end up so upset because I was still hands free but he was getting what he needed. Babies need the closeness. Added bonus. I could do it shirtless and I was fully covered and we still got skin on skin.

My son will be 5 this coming August. I’ve been dating someone amazing since June last year and he was very understanding about taking it easy just in case it still hurt. He is bigger than my ex(almost twice as long and a hair thicker) and it never hurt once because he cared enough to go slow until I was good for more. Have you tried being on top so you can go at your pace? That might help. Editing to add, I had a severe second degree tear(I literally asked while my pb was seeing me up) and asked how many stitches that means. They do basically a running stitch so technically it was one, but the amount used was equal to 10. It got infected twice."

relationship_advice,fl7g368,t3_fmtwkn,1584901004.0,"Part of coming from abuse is being more alert to tiny movements. It’s not fair to you, but. You can help him by encouraging therapy, trying to remember not to move too fast, and just reminding him constantly that you care and would never hit him for any reason. My rule with myself is if I ever feel like I need to hit someone for basically no reason, I’ll leave. I don’t want to be that person so I remind my boyfriend I will never hit him. I draw the line at cheating. I will deck him for that, but I fully trust him to tell me his needs and wants before he would get to the point of wanting to cheat."

Basically been willing to play with him since day one. They go on walks. They go to the store. He takes him for ice cream. He takes him to the park. And I get a break! It’s really amazing.

Methadone,fh4fy9g,t3_f1dule,1581278270.0,Following because my boyfriend thinks I think this. Little more to dig into
bettafish,fgupsmo,t3_f0b7ms,1581126617.0,I love the marbles!!
JUSTNOMIL,fgpk27y,t1_fgpdekf,1581006373.0,"This. When it’s unexpected it’s harder. My grandma died a few years ago, we had a two week warning yet knew she was struggling for a few years. When she gave up she went fast. She’s no longer in pain. No longer suffering. She couldn’t sit for very long before her back would hurt(cancer in her spine, can’t remember what kind) she was very miserable and fought that for I wanna say three years. She deserves peace. She fought for a long time and was in remission for I wanna say 10-14 years before it came back. She lived 23 years(a few more days would have been 24) without my grandpa. Now they are together and happy. My uncle died suddenly and my aunt is still a wreck. That was 4 years ago. Knowing gives time to prepare for everyone. It’s a huge difference."
JUSTNOMIL,fgpjj2b,t3_ezsade,1581006060.0,"You should honor his wishes. He was the one you vowed to love cherish and all that. He’d want you happy. Don’t let her drag you down. Tell her he wished for you to be happy and try to love a normal life. What better way to mourn than make sure you take care of yourself?? Also. I have no other words than. She’s dumb. Yes. Be relieved he’s no longer suffering, fighting, or in pain. But it’s also okay to not be okay some days. Just take those days for you if you need to."
JustNoSO,fgpiaqn,t1_fgnz1as,1581005348.0,"I’ll add. She could say “I’ve noticed you’re not doing your equal share. Do you want me to help remind you some days? I know it’s hard to be motivated to do X some days but it’s even harder for me to feel like I’m not being heard on this again” or “it seems like this is getting harder, I’ll swap you this so you can do that if you’d like”. My boyfriend isn’t much of a cleaner and either as I. But I don’t mind doing washing and drying, and he doesn’t mind folding and dishes. We have this already figured out for when we move in together. Pretty sure the rest of the cleaning will fall to me, but as long as I don’t have to do dishes, I don’t really mind since I do stay home with my 4 year old son(previous relationship) and my man is good about spending time with him so I also get to just relax a lot when he’s around. It’s really just about balance."
Anxiety,fg3q0bs,t3_ewbhpn,1580487186.0,Done and done. Glad I saw this because I didn’t even realize I was doing it!
funny,ffjxkea,t3_ets4l4,1580009713.0,So iPhones of you hit the power button 5 times really fast. It does this. Weird noise even turned off. So awkward convo when he shows up and he’s the guy I’ve dubbed the hot cop. Needless to say basically telling him I was pissed at my phone for freezing we had a good laugh.
NarcissisticAbuse,ffft73f,t1_ffej5m7,1579891268.0,It really doesn’t. It’s hard because I am quite sarcastic at times
NarcissisticAbuse,ffei962,t1_ffefg7f,1579849087.0,"I definitely do. I don’t really like talking to people face to face so I’m trying to make it happen so i can work through it. Online is definitely easier because heck. Idk who they are most of the time so if I say something stupid, I can be like. Hahahahaha sorry. My sarcasm is dumb."

NarcissisticAbuse,ffdynxc,t3_esxqvv,1579832207.0,"Don’t go for emotionally connecting. For for mentally connecting. For me, I trust no one except my current boyfriend and myself, due to my nex. We mentally connected the first night talking. We talked for a month daily before meeting. It was hard work pushing myself some days. Basically. My ex tried to rule my life. Now he can’t, and he’s noticed that. So things are only about our son. I have anxiety on top of the stuff he caused, so I get you. If you ever wanna just talk to rant or compare approaches or whatever, I’m pretty much always around"
shrimptank,ffcoa3z,t1_ffcllae,1579803698.0,Very true. I’ll be following to make sure no more of mine end up there
