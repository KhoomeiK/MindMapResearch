I love being on that super high, where nothing can be bad, nothing effects me and everything is beautiful. But at the same time, I cant handle it and in some ways hate it, because for every super high, is a super low that is coming. It's like being on the upward drive of a roller-coaster, where the higher you go the faster the downward drive after you tip over the edge.

This week alone I've has 2 super highs and 2 super lows and the yoyoing is so hard. I have multiple physical illnesses that are exhasterbated by mental states and yoyoing takes such a toll.

I think your description of Anna however is correct, she is the people pleaser and anxiety ridden person within us all, wanting love and giving it, but still thinking she isn't truly worthy of love, because she's never felt it before. And they are both such true descriptions of bpd still.

If doing online uni is what you've found you need to do for you to thrive and succeed, then ignore everyone else. They don't understand, and their perspective is warped by their own bias.

Him slapping you is a power and control move, his words would have been powerless, so he resorted to physically hurting you as a way for him to stay in control. Sad scared men resort to this when they know they are losing control and have no other way to stay in control over the others around them.

If you have been working, you get up to a 3month period stand down, where you must be actively looking for jobs, before you can apply for the benefit, if you left your job, or if you were fired, depending on the circumstances (as firing someone in nz is very difficult).

AskMenAdvice,fmp2t3z,t1_fmp1696,1586273346.0,"I want to salvage it so badly because before this he was one of my best guys friends. And one of the few guys I thought I could actually rely on. And I've now told him multiple times nothing will happen between us, and I've refused to be around him even drinking since incase he gets the wrong idea. And what cycle am I meant to break?? I don't get it? After he mentioned it I told him once again not to... Do you mean that cycle??"
AskMenAdvice,fmp2bsh,t1_fmp183e,1586273077.0,"I didn't know most of this detail till the next day when he told me... We also kept in contact via snapchat before hand... So I have a photographic record of the pretext.
And I had just come out of a seriously abusive relationship... Where alcohol was my way of dealing with the trauma., I thankfully am not that way now, thank you... And don't need to lay off it.
And yes, I guess I want it all... I want my friendship back in the way it was before all this. From your reply I guess that is not possible at all... But I had held out hope, that like me he could have gotten over what happened between us that night and our friendship could have rebuilt. And I figured since I didn't give him any actual consequences about taking advantage of me whilst I was drunk... I might not have any either... I guess I was wrong... And will now just have to live with that."
AskMenAdvice,fmp1dx1,t1_fmoybw3,1586272551.0,"A. Did you read any of my other replies? 
B. I was black out drunk and expected my sober friend not to advantage of that... How is this my fault (specially when he knew I had been drinking Alot before he decided to come over)
C. He knew I was drinking because I was just coming out of a seriously abusive relationship (a year ago), 
D. I only take it so seriously because he was one of my best friends before this, and he brought it up again tonight and said he's still trying to get over the kiss still."
AskMenAdvice,fmoq9dq,t1_fmopabi,1586266111.0,"I have been honest with him since the day after that I saw him as no more than just a friend and it was only because I was black out drunk and vulnerable that it happened. And it's a little iffy to go no contact now, nearly a year later. I'm looking for a way to continue being his friend. Not go nuclear on him."
AskMenAdvice,fmopyt7,t1_fmooojq,1586265917.0,"I told him that night was the only night I ever felt attracted to him, and that it was only because I felt close to him emotionally and felt safe with him after such an abusive relationship, and was black out drunk, as I had never felt that way about him ever before... He made me feel bad about doing it and regretting it (because he said he was such an ugly guy, how could he ever actually think I liked him like that), but after this he told me about how he knew this was going to happen because of the thing between us since we met (I nealy screamed him out of my house, to the point that my flatmates checked in on me) and every time since then that's he's gotten drunk/ also been sad, he's brought it up... I asked him once again to not mention it, and that it was a mistake. I. Really hope this is enough..as I truly think this friendship is worth salvaging, and if time is what it needs... Then I will give it that... If not, I'm at a loss., how long do you recommend though, as I've been past this for a long time now... And thought he was too.
Edited to show: he said the harsh words about himself... That's not what I think oor told him."
AskMenAdvice,fmoo3h2,t1_fmonk3f,1586264622.0,The thing is I do... I consider him one of my good friends (besides this). And hes one of the few long term friends that I've had. Thats why I want to help him get over the kiss.... So we can continue being friends.

AskMenAdvice,fmongei,t1_fmon7jw,1586264155.0,"Oh, I have already... And then he stops for a while.... And then brings it up again and then apologises for doing so when I once again say Im uncomfortable with him mentioning it."

If he can't properly look after and train those breeds - like you want, and like they should be - he shouldnt have them, doing this to breeds like the ones he wants should be considered animal cruelty. I hate that my mum does this to her dogs, and it's so unfair on the dogs, who deserve far better, and yours will too."
AmItheAsshole,fmksvls,t3_fvojtw,1586167342.0,"NAH - and I'll probs get down voted if this gets seen, but as someone who grew up away from several of their siblings, at this point the youngest brother probably feels more like a cousin than a sibling to OP, and that's unfortunate for the youngest to get left out like that, but OP doesn't have a relationship with the youngest, and will probably never have the same relationship with him as op has with his other siblings, specially if they only see each other at Christmas etc. So to me it makes sense that OP would choose his friends over his sibling, a d to me he's not the asshole for that. Does it suck he doesn't have enough spaces for his other brother, of course, but he had to choose and chose the people he's closest too. And we don't know the specifics around it, and can't blame them not having a relationship just on OP because he's older."
AmItheAsshole,fmkqqyg,t3_fvmids,1586164928.0,"NTA, I had this exact same choice when I was 15/16, between moving with my mum or staying with my grandparents and I chose to stay... And it was the best decision for myself I could have made. 

I and my mum lived with my grandparents and she wanted to move closer to her job... I could move or stay. There wasn't the money dynamic here.. But I chose to stay with my grandparents who raised me and who I had a better relationship with and with my friends in a town I already had a job in. And honestly it worked out for the better for me and I don't regret my decision at all. You can still see your parents in the weekends or school holidays and other holidays.

It sucks your grandparents have to hold money over your parents heads for your parents to actually have to listen to you and let you do what you want... But as bad as it is, it maybe be for the best, as that way you get to actually choose."

AmItheAsshole,fm93a78,t1_fm84vyn,1585860900.0,"OP, you're not the asshole at all for wanting to set boundaries, but you are the asshole for letting this go on for so long and putting your husband through this too... you are an enabler.... 

Doing this for 5 years is absolutely insane, and has taught your parents that they are allowed to do this, and I'm actually really surprised it took them this long to ask for your PILs number, since you've let this go on so long. You've let this go on for too long but it's good that you are finally wanting to set boundaries and I agree with others that giving them a no contact time out is a really good idea or at the minimum setting very clear boundaries, with the consequence of a no contact time out if they don't abide by them.

And I totally understand, he was my baby, and he was my reason for living and coming home every day. I've had him since he was 8weeks old, and he was my everything. 

I'm so happy for those who still have their pets, as I know the peace and harmony they can bring to ones soul. And I would cry over him everyday, but i know that would not help me right now, and crying over things usually only makes things worse for me. And this is my last month of drugs ect, but I need the distraction right now. 

And I've made the decision to not get another pet. Losing Gingey is already too much, and I cannot have a pet at my currently property and I would feel so much worse, if I got another pet and Gingey came home, 

I am also currently waiting for my psych to get back from a 6 week over seas trip, so I am having to deal with all of this without any help. And i absolutely gave him my all, and he showed me he knew it, which is why not having near me is so hard, after 2years of constant love and affection."

Though I understand why you would think that purely based on this incident. I have found out since this was posted, that she actually slept with the guy I liked before her ex looked after me, and she was simply using him staying at mine as a reason/ excuse as to why she did it (to those who didn't know the full situation), so that she wouldn't look like such a bad person and be turned on by me and my group."

I'm not saying it's right, or defending it and I wish it wasn't this way. But it is."
