Saltoon,fpqynv2,t1_fpqy9ku,1588836326.0,"But what messed us up is we started to win before the over time and they took it over at the last minute. Which lead into over time and they was getting control but we continued to make them lose control so pretty much it did remain neutral and I’m pretty sure we passed over time ten seconds. But they still was able to win cause they got control. It was the one with two zones. 

Also, this happened before but this time my team was losing but we made them get over time and we was trying to gain control again but it still wasn’t claimed but they still one since it wasn’t claimed and I guess it passed ten seconds. Like it doesn’t make sense."
Saltoon,fpqpg8j,t1_fpqp4op,1588828528.0,Same no I agree. But sometimes I feel like it makes no sense.

SuicideWatch,fo7877o,t1_fo69wl2,1587573918.0,Mines kept having women that had attitude problems
SuicideWatch,fo5rdm4,t1_fo5pwoz,1587533330.0,Oh I’m doing very fine now. Thank you!
SuicideWatch,fo5ny33,t1_fo5mxv8,1587530515.0,Oh and after that. I don’t know. I’ve been thinking about joining the army weirdly 🤣 but yeah I don’t know.
SuicideWatch,fo5nvq6,t1_fo5mxv8,1587530464.0,"Yeah same here. I live in Miami Florida 🤣
I have. Deal with crazy weather and crazy people 😅 that’s why I don’t really go outside lol, well that and I don’t really have a reason to go outside as well. 

Yeah she really appreciated! Which I’m glad about, I mean we still talk to this day! Yeah I wanna go to japan through a Japanese learning school so I can be there for three months and learn Japanese and japan but I have to make about 10k USD and I don’t think I’ll be able to make that much. Specially with problems now 😅　so I think I’ll try to try another year or try to go with a friend so I can be on a much smaller budget an stay for a week or hopefully a month. 

Or I don’t know get lucky from someone random person. But that’s definitely not gonna happen 🤣 I mean I’ve made some money by selling drawings on instagram. But my depression has been killing my motivation so I closed commissions."
SuicideWatch,fo5lvwm,t1_fo5lftz,1587528912.0,"I’ve know them sense last year October! Or longer! I know A Japanese mom she’s like another mom to me but I’ve known her since maybe October? I don’t remember the exact month. But I started talking to her after the typhoon hit japan. And I asked her if she was okay and we just started talking. I really appreciate her though! 

Yeah I’m lazy kid and still am honestly lol. I wanna go to japan next month, so I wanted to start working but no luck. I think my curiosity of wanting to go to Japan keeps me going honestly. Even though I’m on a thin wire with life. I wanna go to japan fresh out of high school. As a vacation and meeting people I care about (*^ω^*) 

Also ya know I don’t really know what drove me into wanting to know more about japan. I think it started with me loving my favorite singer music lol and it went on from there. 

I’ll keep that bit of Russian knowledge in mind lol."
depression_memes,fo5l0vp,t3_g5pfqh,1587528269.0,I’ve heard of you suffer from depression you age faster mentally
SuicideWatch,fo5kuvs,t1_fo5klve,1587528147.0,"Yeah I have people that I know. And it’s okay if a jump him I have more people talk to know and love! Russian seems like a hard language lol maybe pronunciation wise but it seems cool to try lol. 

Hi is Japanese is こんにちは　(kon ni chi wa)"
SuicideWatch,fo5iudr,t1_fo5huy4,1587526704.0,And yeah Japanese is really hard I have people that can help. But English is hard for them too 🤣
SuicideWatch,fo5isld,t1_fo5huy4,1587526668.0,Yeah same. I wanna meet people that I care about there. I love the culture and music there as well. I mean I still don’t understand some words. But I’m still trying. I mean I’ve been lazy since I’ve been mostly focusing on art but I’m still trying. A guy that thought was a good friend kept getting upset with me cause my Japanese was still pretty bad after just a year and was being passive aggressive and when I got on him about it and act like he didn’t care and just blocked me. It didn’t effect me as much though. Cause I felt like he didn’t care about me anyways. It sucks that I had a cry on him at first. But forget him ya know 🤣
SuicideWatch,fo5iij4,t3_g5tw8k,1587526474.0,(also sorry if I seem like I’m spamming. I don’t mean too.)
SuicideWatch,fo5gsbi,t1_fo5gkht,1587525276.0,I like listening to his music cause I’m trying to get better at Japanese and I just like his style.
SuicideWatch,fo5gqez,t1_fo5gkht,1587525241.0,Also melody for you is a very good song too.
SuicideWatch,fo5gpkz,t1_fo5gkht,1587525225.0,Oh with Toshiki-San... I really like all of his music but secret lover is my all time favorite. But the album I think you should listen to first is either after five clash or sea is a lady.
SuicideWatch,fo5gep7,t1_fo5ga3n,1587525018.0,"It’s okay not a lot people know Him. I wish people did though, he’s an 80s Japanese singer! I’ve listen to the weekend I like the song star boy and I feel it coming."
SuicideWatch,fo5g3js,t1_fo5f6aw,1587524804.0,"Lol gibberish. Oh and my favorite singer is Toshiki Kadomatsu! He honestly gets me through everything! My chronic migraines, my suicidal thoughts, anxiety, bad triggers, etc! His music is my temporary savior!"
SuicideWatch,fo5ey6s,t1_fo5eu10,1587524017.0,Honestly it’s very upsetting. But it’s also annoying how everyone wants you to call them when the operators don’t want you to feel better.
SuicideWatch,fo5etkx,t1_fo5en6c,1587523932.0,"Tbh I’m not really good at talking to others in my opinion. But I really just wanted to rant.  I don’t think people shouldn’t have to worry about me too much. I think my anxiety is the only thing keeping me alive and my favorite singer!

SuicideWatch,fo25jsg,t3_g59z2b,1587450408.0,"As a person who has been sexual assaulted as a child and on my way to adulthood I might mess up on this and I’m bad at giving advice In general. I’ll just say. Do not beat yourself up on it. You regret it and I know you feel bad and want to apologize. Which I kinda appreciate you for saying what you have done wrong. But also this may sound strange but. Some of it maybe on her fault too. Like if you were obviously aroused and you wanted her off of you. And she didn’t, then she did a wrong move by not getting off of you. But I’m not saying what you did was a right move either. I think a shove would have been a better move. But it’s the past and please don’t be yourself in it. Forgive yourself! 

Also sorry! I hope this helps!"
SuicideWatch,fo23jmn,t1_fljldnh,1587448635.0,Same I’ve isolated myself before this as well.
fivenightsatfreddys,fn42hjk,t1_fn428d6,1586632723.0,Also you guys probably get a lot of people who break the rules on purpose so it’s probably pretty annoying. So I kinda understand why the stern way on people who break rules. So yeah! I appreciate for talking to me though. And your welcome! Yeah I rather not get mad over little internet mistakes I’ve done. I have other things to worry about. 🤣
fivenightsatfreddys,fn421eh,t1_fn41xqj,1586632461.0,Yeah I’m sorry I’ll keep in mind of the rules next time friend! ( ◠‿◠ )

fivenightsatfreddys,fn41try,t1_fn41hin,1586632340.0,I mean I see how I broke a rule so my problem. Yeah reddit is not my place which is fine. Hope you guys have great day. I’ll go back into being a shadow fan again lol.
fivenightsatfreddys,fn41noo,t1_fn41g0n,1586632242.0,Okay I understand I broke I rule which I apologize and I will take it to concentration next time. But I didn’t break a law so it shouldn’t be so bad. So I apologize I’ll try not to do it again.
fivenightsatfreddys,fn41cwo,t1_fn417qi,1586632067.0,Yeah but I’m asking a question so people can prove me wrong. I didn’t know questioning something is wrong. 😕
fivenightsatfreddys,fn419qq,t1_fn412aq,1586632015.0,Well thanks for telling me. lol I’m getting attacked for my opinion unfortunately. Just for wanting everything to be all in the clear!
fivenightsatfreddys,fn415ca,t1_fn40zxj,1586631944.0,I think I should be able to suspect too. I just want to make sure everything is okay. And nothing is out of the wrong 😕 I mean we like Scott I don’t want people using him.
fivenightsatfreddys,fn40wxp,t1_fn40p7m,1586631808.0,"Well since your technical taking someone idea and selling it, and not having permission and Mark is getting profit out of it is not okay. Unless and hopefully scott is getting profit off of it too. Then I’ll definitely understand and I think it’s okay!"
fivenightsatfreddys,fn40npy,t1_fn40ftr,1586631661.0,Don’t want to start anything but did mark mention that he did? I’m just curious don’t want to be malicious I promise! 🙇🏾‍♀️
fivenightsatfreddys,fn40j0v,t1_fn40d8f,1586631587.0,"Well cause I want someone to really tell me. Cause it kinda is an important question on merch. Cause ya know Scott’s problem with people stealing his content is over pricing it. But, if it seemed like I broke a rule I apologize!"
fivenightsatfreddys,fn40cym,t1_fn409uw,1586631490.0,Hope so! 👌🏾
fivenightsatfreddys,fn40ajf,t1_fn404xs,1586631451.0,I hope not. Also I don’t think it’s misleading. Cause it is an important question.

depression_memes,f08p9iu,t3_d44y70,1568485189.0,Me but online 😂
AskThe_Donald,ew4n1rt,t3_cmtf1r,1565114095.0,I don’t really agree with that games are the main point. Cause I even play video games as well that are deemed violent and to be honest as a depressed teen with other issues going on. Games like those and not like those help me calm down. Specially I even have chronic illness it even helps me distract that. So I don’t agree to what he said but I think I somewhat understand cause like in the society there’s so much anger and hate around where some people are bound to be more active then talking and do violent actions I think it’s more for on our part to fix it so we can help stop this and help focus on mental health and etc.
