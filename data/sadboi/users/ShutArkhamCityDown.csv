It’d be too try-hard in my opinion. 

And I want to add that during my first two watches, The Chrismuk-huh episode was underwhelming and boring but I’ve just watched it for the third time and it resonated way more profound this time. The scenes when Ryan realized he couldn’t change what happened to Marissa in fact, he even prolonged her lifetime and helped all the families to stay together without knowing are really some of the best scenes of the show. I have to mention hearing “Fade Into You” again may have helped forming this opinion haha. whileI’m not saying you should watch the show a dozen times to enjoy it but it’s worth it nevertheless :)

I think it even makes it more successful as there are being less songs, it’s more of an hit or miss situation. 

Well it’s music after all, there are no whites and blacks but I don’t really agree with an album being more accessible makes it better. Problem with Nirvana is that they knew how to write catchy songs but also they usually followed the same formula composing songs which caused them to sound so repetitive. They really lacked variety in their stuff whilst Alice In Chains proved many times they could pull off acoustic songs, sludgy songs, radio hits and hell, even love songs with different structures and elements (unfortunately, this doesn’t apply to the Duvall-era AiC)

Also I wouldn’t say Alice In Chains is that niche, especially their early stuff. You could take some songs from Facelift and put them on a Guns N Roses (the band that topped charts just before grunge) album and they wouldn’t be out of place really."

Especially Alice In Chains, Soundgarden and Stone Temple Pilots (although they're not from Seattle). They used some unusual chord progressions, time signatures which was never really common in mainstream music. Also, they blended wide genres from Sludge to Punk together.
