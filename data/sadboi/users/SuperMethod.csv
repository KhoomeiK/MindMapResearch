mentalhealth,flxxi50,t1_flrm9a1,1585591691.0,Next time when I need help I‚Äôm going to change and reach out. I think it would help me a lot more than just bottling everything up
mentalhealth,flxxank,t1_flrjjp8,1585591580.0,Thank you. Imma try and stay strong in the meantime.
mentalhealth,flrik3v,t1_flpzg54,1585420932.0,I only have 2 years left of high school then I‚Äôm off to college in another state far away from everything.
mentalhealth,flpey53,t1_flpehdt,1585357902.0,Thank you for this suggestion. I‚Äôll be sure to give it a try. I‚Äôm hoping once this hole Coronavirus thing blows over i can continue with school. I‚Äôm just waiting and counting down the days to when I‚Äôm going to college and can escape. I‚Äôll try to get over this and fix myself. I want to be able to get better.
mentalhealth,flpa6yl,t3_fplncz,1585354862.0,I feel the same but towards my younger siblings. I have to younger brothers and they are both straight A students. I have always gotten a mix of every grade on my report card for as long as I can remember. My parents constantly scream at me to get my grads up and constantly use verbal abuse as a ‚Äúmotivation‚Äù method. I can do any other task that involves physically making or doing it. Because of this my parents use me to do all of the house chores and when ever I bring up a problem I‚Äôm seen as annoying and how dare I bring such negativity to them when they are busy.  I fall behind in school because I feel like shit all the time because I am always ignored and used.  So because I feel like shit it‚Äôs hard to sleep and study so it‚Äôs a never ending cycle.
sadboys,fkj3kit,t1_fkj33w9,1584235317.0,I can relate. My room is very small as well and have left albums on my floor to take a picture. I went to the bathroom and my sister stepped on one I was sadüò≠
sadboys,fkiycp5,t3_fiibyr,1584231575.0,I wouldn‚Äôt put those on the ground if I did something like that I would step on it lol
gaybros,fk30mug,t3_fftubk,1583814013.0,"My parents didn‚Äôt want a kid and because of my dads temper when I did something wrong as a kid I would get multiple spankings and/or smacks depending on which one. Because of this every time I hear yelling and get into trouble I brace for a hit as an instinct. My siblings never really got spankings or smacks and were sent to there rooms. Now your probably thinking what does this have to do with this post? Well because of what was happening at home on top of me having ADHD and ADD, I can never sit still in class and focus so my teachers and parents have all labeled me as the dumb kid and because I was constantly excluded from my friends activities for being different. I grew farther from people and now can‚Äôt talk to people that well because I never learned social skills. However, because I can‚Äôt trust others I struggle really hard in relationships because it‚Äôs hard for me to put effort into anything because I am so used to failing. 

Sorry it‚Äôs long."

depression,fj5t1av,t3_exo6f1,1583042105.0,I have been trying to invite people places to get out of my house and away from my parents. No one has shown up to a single one and my parents just leave me at home so they can do fun stuff with the rest of the family while I‚Äôm all by myself

depression,fipheuo,t3_f8y7np,1582607022.0,It‚Äôs ok I have also reached rock bottom. We can be sad together. I‚Äôm excluded from everything by everyone and whenever I try to make an effort and invite people to do things they either cancel last minute of just leave me on read and don‚Äôt show up so I have just gone to roller kingdom by myself like 10 times and go to group events by myself because no one wonts to be friends with me. It‚Äôs like ok dude I sit next to you in class and ur just gonna ignore me it‚Äôs fine. They only talk to you when they need something üòí
sadpeople,fhy8c4m,t3_dxxcm4,1581970707.0,I can relate. I‚Äôm transgender ftm and everyone whispers shit about me all the time. I can‚Äôt even talk to my family without them pushing calling me selfish and attention seeking when in reality I just want to be left alone. Everyone comes to me with there problems and I fix them the best I can and am there for them but no one does the same for me so I‚Äôm just being used all the time
depression,fhxxh8u,t1_fhtg7ju,1581964350.0,I feel the same. But every time I try to convince my parents that we should move they just ignore me. I can‚Äôt even have conversations with my friends because they are just bored of me. I can honestly say that I‚Äôm so used to being hurt by friends and family it doesn‚Äôt surprise me when they don‚Äôt care what I have to say
depression,fhri86x,t1_fhqu7ax,1581826946.0,Thanks man. I have no one to talk to about my problems because I don‚Äôt want to show people my weak sides and I honestly just posted this because when I write it lightens the weight off my shoulders and I just needed someone today and thank you for your response. It means a lot

AMA,f4tfj79,t1_f4t4z9n,1571787781.0,Every one has dark thoughts. You yourself are probably not all that innocent it‚Äôs weather we choose to act on these thoughts that define us. Pert of the mind will always be negative and the other positive you cant just live in a body that doesn‚Äôt have dark anything. Part of the thought process is letting these thoughts drift away to be forgotten like all ideas and ideals. I myself am 15 and have excepted all of my thoughts as a part of me. We are not defined by our thoughts üí≠ we are defined by the decisions we make in our live and how we treat others
