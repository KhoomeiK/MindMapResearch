NAH.
Before you downvote me for going against the majority, just hear me out.
We're all so quick to throw out judgements and words like ""disregard, disrespect, asshole"" whatever.
It's actually encouraged to be more harsh in your delivery, because it gets more attention from people, but let's just think rationally.
It's cookies.
He didn't value those ""special"" cookies as much as you and couldn't contain his sweet tooth.
Obviously he's at fault. But he's not an asshole and didn't specifically go out of his way to hurt her. He's just immature. I didn't actually think he was going to sleep on the couch like he jokingly said. 
All I'm saying is it's obviously his fault, but we're being too harsh and it seems like you've got issues with resolving conflicts."

Anxiety,fppdspt,t3_geiyn7,1588800453.0,"A great advice I once heard:

Suck at something.

When you let go of the unrealistic expectations you set for yourself, you will be free to do what you enjoy doing or what you need to do to grow. Because you will fuck up things a thousand times and that's not where the problem's rooted. It's in beating yourself up for mistakes and being too scared to make them.

I'm glad for being a total fuckup on my first summer job. I'm glad for burning an omelette a hundred times, for having awkward dates, miserable relationships, because I know that all these things taught me lessons that made me be who I am.

So, go ahead and suck at something."
