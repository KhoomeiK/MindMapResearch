It’s your sperm, you get to chose what happens to it. I think you did a good job considering if they were ready or not. Straight couples can have kids whenever, but that doesn’t exactly mean they should. If they can’t figure their own relationship out, how are they going to be able to work together to raise a child? It’s childish to even think about having a kid under those terms. Children shouldn’t raise children. I don’t believe that you’re friends are immature in a general sense, but their rash decision could lead to 18+ years of commitment.

Also having contact with your child while they’re not home is a nice feature. For example, if a guy were to be homosexual and be open about that with friends, but have homophobic parents; searching through their phone could get them kicked out of the house depending on who the parents are. I feel like taking away the phone is a good punishment, but breaking it is a bit too far for this reason. If the kid (who’s most likely underage) were sending nudes or something then breaking it would be reasonable.

Certain things would accept this, but there are some good reasons for not wanting a parent to look through your phone."
