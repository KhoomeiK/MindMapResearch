I handle the housework and cooking 95% of the time. It could be overwhelming if I fell behind a few days and didn't have a good plan. 

This is a full time job, for sure. 

The kiddo is awake from sun up until about 8:30 aside from a potential 30 minute-2 hour nap. He has to eat 3x a day, plus snacks. Food requires supervision directly related to how messy it is. There is at least 1 load of laundry daily, maybe more depending if it's bedding day, etc. Dishes also never end. Floors/surfaces have to be cleaned. Kid needs entertained by more than the TV and that means free play, reading, numbers, and physical activity. Toddlers should always be within a few steps of visibility. 

Everything takes longer with a little kid involved. There's constant questions, violent refusal of random tasks, floundering on decisions, and every other hindrance their illogical little brains can muster. Oh, and you have to keep them kinda clean too. Errands with a toddler could be a sport tbh. Naptime is a blessing and a curse.

I think a brain interprets this whatever way it can rationalize best. I think these entities are a person's thoughts in the altered consciousness. If they believe in aliens or god, that is what the brain assumes this journey is. I say altered because though your eyes might close, or be open and not see your surroundings as they are, you are not unconscious or sleeping. Brains are easy to trick.

Advice,ff7hvnj,t1_ff7giml,1579649921.0,"Healthcare is services you receive toward your health. Insurance is a middle man between you and healthcare. It drives up the cost of medical treatment in a cycle because insurance companies haggle for lower prices. As they talk their numbers lower, it raises the cost of out of pocket services. Less people can pay their bill, which also drives up the price. It's pretty fucked when cost should just be reasonable and public health should be the focus. 

Most schools offer ""family planning"" type services (pap smears, birth control, various testing) or can direct you to a local income based clinic. Most health insurance won't cover dental services,  though some offer dental plans. It may cover if you need actual oral surgery, but that varies by plan/coverage. Your best bet would be locating your nearest dental school. Otherwise, I believe HSAs are pretty straightforward (idk about dental care) and there is also a program for medical credit (I think it's carecredit). All 4 wisdom teeth, impacted, removed by an oral surgeon will probably set you back a couple grand, less work needed way less money. A standard extraction with gas might be $250.

I see insurance is betting against yourself. Might I break my arm? Yes. But should I pay someone $400/month just in case? And get none of it back if I stay healthy?
