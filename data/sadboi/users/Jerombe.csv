When I unlocked the floor in my first game the perk-a-cola machines were different (double tap and electric cherry) so perhaps they randomize the locations every game too.

If you allow the alien plants to emerge from the ground and shoot them all you get a Max ammo so I thought that was a handy trick for the later rounds!

Enjoy!"

When you're a fan of a DJ (or any cultural aspect in this matter), you can wear merch or make a totem for it at a rave just to catch anyone's attention with similar interests like you. I do this sometimes wearing merch from even non-EDM artists and get fun conversations out of strangers all the time. I guess since ILLENIUM jerseys are so main stream now, that's what makes it tasteless and weird for y'all? But wearing merch from artists in shows/festivals not featuring them isn't that weird and is pretty common IMO!"
