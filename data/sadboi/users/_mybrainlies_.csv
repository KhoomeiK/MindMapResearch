The idea of multiples interest me as well.  My bio brother is 11 months older than I am and even though we were raised by different family‚Äôs our personality and core is very similar.  Other people see it more than we do.  It‚Äôs weird.  

It sounds like your family dynamics are pretty full on.  Guess it‚Äôs good they don‚Äôt live too close together.  My adopted parents don‚Äôt have any info on my birth parents.  Aside from names that‚Äôs about it.  And they didn‚Äôt even meet my bio mother.   It‚Äôs great that you have are on good terms with everyone. Must be hard.  I commend you."

Do you bio parents and adopted parents go on well together.  Sorry if this is too much."
Adopted,fqwea17,t1_fqwbr7j,1589701341.0,"Adoption is definitely traumatic.  There is always a underlying sense of unknowing.  

I am sorry you feel hopeless and alone.  I can assure that you are not.  

Depression associated with adoption I feel is pretty high.  I was in and out of hospitals.  Have some serious close calls with suicide.  Drank way too much.  But now I am finally (at 36) realising that I am the one that makes my own happiness and I am control of how I feel.  

The documentary is pretty full on.  My bio brother doesn‚Äôt want to watch it. He doesn‚Äôt like any film or documentary too heavily focused on adoptions.  But. To be fair. The film is super interesting.  So you keep in touch with your bio parents as well as your adopted ones?   

Stay up and remember you are not alone in this."

Adopted,fq5cfv3,t1_fq5bwgj,1589100093.0,Yea.  It‚Äôs hard to keep it all straight.  Big confusing families.  It‚Äôs weird too because mine is so big but I don‚Äôt actually feel apart of it.  I don‚Äôt really talk to any of them anymore.  I don‚Äôt know why to be honest.  Maybe because I moved to the other side of the world.

So you have no intention of finding your birth parents or learning anything about your own past?"
Adopted,fq4y64l,t1_fq2mbjq,1589087103.0,"Thanks!  Thats all I can really do.  I want my son to grow up knowing where he came from.  I mean he has so much history and family on his mums side, but on mine their is just a black hole.  He knows my parents and has met them and likes them.   but he is too young to understand the dynamics of our relationship.  

&#x200B;

You and your brother were adopted by different families too?!  Was that like a thing back in the day?  I mean, when I asked my parents why they didn't adopt both my brother and I, they said that they only wanted me.  They already had a son of their own that was two years older than me.   I just think its so fucked up to do something like that consciously.   my bio-brother was adopted after me.  so he actually had to stay longer.  and yea.  we both did/do have very parallel lives.  We moved to California in the mid 2000s and went to Mexico to search for our mother.  Lived together for a while and then lived in the same city for a few years before I bailed on the United States and moved across the world.  Even now, we still do things very similar.  Silly things, like we will not talk or skype for a while and then when we do we both a beard or shaved a mustache.  we have a pretty deep connected.  He is only 11 months older than I am."
Adopted,fq4x4dz,t1_fq4hvu7,1589086336.0,"Have you ever been in contact with your sister?  Luckily my parents and my bio brothers parents kept in contact.  We saw each other a couple times a year at holidays and stuff.  At first I was just happy to have another brown person to talk to, I think we were told we were brothers when we were pre/early teen.   I think there will always be a sense of separation anxiety and loneliness in adoptees.  

And yes, the movie is intense.  The biggest question that arises is Nurture versus Nature.   The kids were studied/tested unknowingly.  They lived within 100 mile radius of each other and didnt know the others existed.  The families were different social economic classes but all had an older daughter that was also adopted.  So each one grew up with an older sister.  they tried to make the family dynamics similar but then had different parenting styles to see if they were nurtured into different people.  Its a wild ride, that shows how devastating it can be."

Adopted,fq0ngx0,t1_fq0ehvx,1589034722.0,Yea.  We did some research to try to find our birth mother.  But the records in the United States only had names and there was no records in Mexico.  So yah.

trees,fgvbxjt,t3_f0hwod,1581143876.0,"So true!  Something similar with weed happened with me and mine sent me to Military School.  

It was even worse there!   The majority of kids didn‚Äôt want to be there so basically you just learned other ways to get away with bad things.  

People would sneak drugs, alcohol, girls onto campus.  Sneaking out, smuggling things in.  

Crazy shit."
Adopted,fgry0w5,t3_f06lss,1581062105.0,"Hello.  Mexican here adopted by an ALL white family from the Midwest.  I grew up being the ""black sheep"" in the family not only because of my skin colour but because I started to realise quite early in my life that I had very different values and beliefs from my family.  

I was adopted at about 3 years old and was already speaking Spanish fluently.  My adopted parents did not speak Spanish, so I stopped speaking as well.  In fact, I even had to take speech classes to get rid of my ""accent"".  

Once I was old enough I moved out to California.  I started a life out there.  Obviously there are way more Mexicans out west so it was really hard for me to communicate and connect to them because my Spanish was shit.  I did take classes when I was in high school, but that wasn't enough.  I felt like that part of me was torn away.  I have talked to my parents about this and they tell me that its my choice as to whether or not I learned Spanish.  But yeah.  I see it differently as I already did speak Spanish, and maybe if we had a speech class that allowed me to continue to speak Spanish it would have been better for me.  I kind of resent my parents for this, but I have learned Italian quite easily (my wife is Italian).  

I have lived all over the world and have settled in Europe.  Where I live there is quite international and I meet people from every where.  Lots of Spanish Speaking people who see me or find out I was born in Mexico and instantly start speaking Spanish to me.  I can understand enough but revert back to English as it is easier for me.  even at 36 years old this is still exhausting and makes me feel disconnected to my own culture.  

I do think you should bring this up with your adopted parents.  See how they react to it.  You said your siblings are also black?  How do they feel about the whole situation.  Are they your biological siblings?  You are lucky that you had them to grow up with.  My biological brother was adopted by a different family.  

Anyway.  I am not really sure where I am going with this.  But being in an inter-racial adoption is fucking hard.  Remember to take care of yourself and try to find your own happiness."
Adopted,fghzq24,t3_eyljyh,1580799238.0,"I don't know how old you are or how financially stable you are but have you ever thought about leaving?  Going on a adventure to find yourself?  

I was also adopted and my biological brother was adopted by a different family.  We kept in touch a little bit when we were younger, but once we were in university we became closer.  

both of us felt a massive disconnect from our adopted families and decided to venture to the other side of the country in search of answers.  

we did this with no money and struggled quite a bit (i suggest planning out better).  But at the end of the day we both started to find who we were (although, I am still trying to figure that out).  

I am not super close to my adopted family, but close enough to chat every once in a while and they visit me and my family (wife and child).  We are getting closer as I get even older, but I still feel a disconnect to them, but those are my issues.  

I don't really have an answer for you on this, but I think you need to concentrate on what makes you happy.  Adoption is fucking hard, and anyone who says it isn't is either lying or isn't directly affected by it. 

Anyways, sorry for the ramble and good luck.  I am hope you find some peace in knowing that you aren't alone in these feelings."
