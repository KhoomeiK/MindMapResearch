depression,ffneeoz,t3_eual16,1580064868.0,3 months ago I started my therapy. Before that I told myself that I should suicide but another voice in my mind told me to give myself one more chance. I still don't feel any worth about myself but I am alive. Just keep trying. Hope you well.

depression,fc4duxa,t3_eg4rzy,1577413809.0,"It is also confusing for me that if someone (like me) suffer from some real problems in their life, and those issues keep happening everyday, how can these consulting or talking help solve these problems? Even if I could get healthy from mental disorders, those problems are stil there.  Currently my answer is that if I could get rid of depression, I probably become more powerful to find some solutions but probably it won't help anything."

depression,fbze2a3,t3_ef6zht,1577243619.0,"I cannot tell whether your parents' love is true or not. Probably my experience is kinda similar. My mom kept telling me how her life was tough and how she worked hard for the family, and she cried in front of me several times. I didn't feel any empathy for her, and I believed that she cried for herself. I used to prove that they kinda love me but I failed. Finally, I accepted the conclusion that my parents don't love me.  I gave up seeking love from them. It is still hurting. From time to time, I comforted myself by understanding they are humans before they are ""parents"", and I am humans before I am a ""daughter"". Now I am away from them and try to make myself happy."

depression,fbawbsh,t3_eav646,1576688165.0,It's true that a lot of people's lives are worse but it's nothing about your pain. There is no way to measure the pain of different people. You don't need to feel sorry about feeling bad.
