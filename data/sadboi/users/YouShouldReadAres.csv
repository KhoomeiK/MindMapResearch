depression_help,fm0bc64,t3_fsa1kd,1585652044.0,"Fuck that sucks. From what you've written, I don't see how you could be in the wrong. It seems that your parents have a dynamic which reinforces miscommunication / talking past each other and not truly listening to each other. It can be hard to communicate honestly when things aren't 100% ok, especially when the other party will unleash emotional burden onto you. 

From the outside this looks like emotional manipulation on your parents side of things. They may be wrapped up so much in their own perspectives to be able to see that this is the effect of their ... ""communication strategy"" with each other.  I say this because my mom can be emotionally manipulative to my siblings and me - we often have to tip-toe around her and cater family situations/conversations/outings to her liking or deal with drawn-out outbursts in which we fear for her safety/wellbeing. What's worse is that she is often so wrapped up in her own perspective that she doesn't see the effects of what she's doing. We rationalize her behavior by understanding that she's sick - this allows us to create emotional distance from her outbursts (it's not us, it's her). 

Unfortunately you and your siblings will be affected by your parents behavior. I would suggest that you practice putting up healthy boundaries between your parents and yourself. Know that you are your own person, with your own wants, and own expectations for your life. If what you want and who you want to be don't line up with your parents expectations, that's on them. 

It's not wrong to be honest. I know sometimes when I hold back from being honest about things that really matter to me, when I finally get that thing off my chest it can come out kind of explosively. That way of conveying information can sometimes be counterproductive (not saying that that's what you did, just that it happens). I would recommend that when you are honest you do so in a way which is clear-cut and factual (ex: when you do this, I feel \_\_\_\_\_) and also extend compassion towards your parents and yourself. 

 The frustration and fear that you feel is understandable. But please know that you are not responsible for your parents outbursts or actions. They alone are responsible for how they act. Yes, what we say or do can trigger emotions in someone else. But a mature, healthy person will handle those emotions differently than someone who is immature or with poor mental health. It is not your fault that your parents are acting immaturely. 

I'm sorry that things have been hard and I'm sorry that you're feeling a lot of pressure to try to support a functional family dynamic. From my own experience, I know that sometimes things have to break and remain broken for awhile. It may take a while for things to get better. For me, I realized in hindsight that the foundation of my relationship with my parents was built on an unhealthy foundation. In order for our relationship to progress, that unhealthy pattern needed to be confronted and broken. 

Things were really rocky for awhile, but because of the tumultuous times we went through - we now interact in a much healthier way. Have hope that things will get better and that the pain you're feeling now will one day result in a healthier family dynamic."
depression,fm03x67,t3_fs3ji3,1585643716.0,"A few years ago, a friend told me this quote: ""comparison is an act of violence against the self"". It stuck with me. I was really into academics when I was younger and most of my assignments were graded on a curve - which really fostered a mentality of constantly assessing my work (and my perceived self-worth) with how I measured up to other people. I've battled with depression for over 10 years and it's taken a lot of work and time for me to stop being critical of myself based on how I think I compare to others. But I've found that giving myself space to do me has been liberating. 

As I've given up that act of comparison, I've also had to recognize and free myself of being the person that others expect me to be. Even letting go of who I expect a ""perfect"" version of myself to be. It's allowed me to meet myself where I am, rather than get hung up on who I'm not. 

I'm still trying to work out how I want to live my life and what steps I need to take to get there. But I've found some purpose in moving towards being someone I can be happy with and offering compassion towards myself by acknowledging that I'm on a journey. I still get sad and sometimes revisit negative spirals. I still fail to be who I want to be. I still have yet to be in a healthy ""long-term"" (ie over a few weeks) relationship. But I'm learning how to love myself in my entirety- and that has given me strength to keep going."

Animesuggest,flgb8ox,t3_foiakn,1585137690.0,"Death Note would definitely get him hooked by the first or second episode. It starts out amazing and each episode somehow gets better and better. It's fast paced, drawn well, and the English dubs are on point. 

Hunter x Hunter is a classic. My friend recently got into anime and really enjoyed it. He liked it too much to finish it (albeit that sounds counterintuitive - he didn't want the story end tho). While many people find the first arc a bit slow, he didn't feel that way. I think because he's not used to competition anime arcs lol. 

Mob Psycho 100 is also great. It has great action scenes and is pretty funny. 

Vinland Saga is amazing. It only has one season, so it could be used as a show to get your friend into anime without being too much of a time commitment.  I'm biased since I've been reading the manga for 10 years and love the story, but my friend who was new to anime loved it.  It's pretty violent, so heads up. 

Full Metal Alchemist and FMA: Brotherhood are also classics. Brotherhood is generally thought to be better - but the creators assume that you had already watched FMA or read the manga, so it can be really confusing to new viewers. Someone new to anime and with no context would probably enjoy FMA. However, FMA also has a lot more filler-like episodes."

The screaming stopped, I thought I had been ignoring it but now I realized I had just gotten used to it. I opened my eyes and saw that the fire had finally died too. I walked out, unscathed. Enough time had passed that the scrapes on my hands and knees had healed. I sighed and asked the villagers if we were done. None of them looked at me, only at the carnage of burnt flesh, but they slowly created a path so that I could leave this civilized hell. So I left. I looked for the child I had saved in the remaining crowd, though I did not want to see him. It was no small mercy that he was not there, however it was a mercy I did not feel I deserved. I had not brought this pain to the village but I had been the one to transfer it. 

My feet fell heavy on the dirt path as it wound its way into the cool dark of the forest. I do not look up for a long time. 

Just walked 

and walked 

and walked 

Until I stood in front of a crumbling well. For a moment I was shocked, scared that I had unknowingly found myself in another village. But as I looked around, I was grateful and confused to see that I was in the deepest part of old forest. Tree roots broke through the ground, thick as aspen trunks, twisting upwards and around, before plunging back into the soil. Moss cloaked the floor of the groove. Far in the distance I could hear the soft laughter of finches. I looked behind me, but I already had a faint idea of where I was and was unsurprised to see that the path that had brought me here was gone. I sighed, contemplating what choice I was to make. It felt like there were only two option, I could rest on the soft blanket of green below me or try to drink from the well. 

""But there are always paths unseen, isn't that right? "" A soft, inviting voice called out. I was too tired to look, too weary to argue. 

""There are always more paths one can take, but is it not better to consider the ones before you, rather than the ones which remain out of reach?"" I replied. 

""That there are!"" The voice answered with mirth, this time louder and closer than before ""An adventurous traveler like yourself must have a name! Could I have it, so that we do not remain strangers in this desolate place?"" 

I was tired of this, my mind dulled with incessant and intrusive thoughts of the past, ""What advantage would you have in making friends, stranger? Perhaps you are right though, a name is not too hard to give... Although, this name comes with a toll you may not be prepared to pay."" 

With that I finally turned and looked at the creature which spoke, the one who had emerged from the trees and skin shifted like bark in uncertain light. And finally the creature stopped edging forward. 

""Wh - What are you?"" 

I chuckled slightly, it is a rare thing to hear a fae stumble over its words. ""In this place, I am myself. I am rooted. Grounded by memories once lost. Although, I suppose that makes little sense. I was once like the young woman you see before you and I was once like you. And then again, I was once like the moon on surface of calm water. I suppose I still am... You know, I have had caregivers although they now fear me like the rest, but I haven't had friends in a long time. If your offer is still open I could give you my - ""

The fae stopped me before I could finish. ""I do deeply appreciate all that you say and all that you offer, but... uhh... and I would, of course, enjoy your friendship! I would also appreciate a friend that I can call something by, for you appear to be as wise and lived as these trees are old, which makes one a cherished friend indeed. I would love to know you as you are, as you were, and as you will become.""

My smile grew, not unkindly but still in the spirit of a devious joy I had thought these bones had forgotten. ""Of course, friendship would be lovely and a joy which I thought barred to one like me - at least, of course, in the human realm. I would greatly appreciate to find a friend in you. I suppose you may call me..."" 

I paused, waiting for the light of inspiration. I walked towards the well and drew water forth. I did not drink for that is not what this water was for. I peered at the calm waters for a moment and then looked up and smiled, ""you may call me what I am, friend, a reflection."""

It only took the villagers half a day to decide who would become the next head priest. The replacement decided that the best course of action was to gag me so that I couldn't speak any spells. As if I had been able to say anything under water. He had also ordered my fingers to be sliced off so I couldn't cast any ritual gestures (as if I knew any). You can imagine how well that went. Honestly, this new priest really didn't seem that bright. But I guess there's a learning curve for every promotion and, to be fair, this was his first day. In the end it was decided that binding my hands with rope would have to do. And then, I was lead to the gallows. It is quite strange to feel the ground fall out from underneath you and watch someone else's neck snap as you slowly sway in the breeze.

Maybe this replacement priest was smarter than I initially thought, he had ordered a death which was relatively quick. Within a few minutes he stopped wheezing and just as suddenly as the light left his eyes there was a loud pop overhead. The gallows man fell through the trap door, hitting my side as he did so and sending me spinning in the other direction. I thought he may have simply tripped, but when I was able to see him clearly his neck was bent at an odd angle and I quickly understood that the priest was not the only one who would be paying the price for my life. The executioner died faster than the priest and I saw a villager in the crowd go down. It appeared that the onlookers were being held culpable as well - I had no idea how many would share the late priests fate, only that this scourge of death would continue for as long as I remained suspended. By the time I was cut down, four more had fallen.

I had thought the second priest quite dense, but the third was a complete idiot. No village counsel was even needed, he volunteered for it. You would think after witnessing two gruesomely botched executions, where those involved in delivering it had been the ones to die, that you would rethink the whole thing. But no. Of course not. I don't know if he was bent on avenging his religious brothers or proving the might of his god over the apparent demon I was, but he was definitely emboldened when he saw the scrapes on my hands and knees from hitting the ground. Even so, choosing death by incineration was a seriously stupid move.

This newest priest wasn't lucky. As he ordered villagers to grab wood and arrange the pyre, the wind began to pick up. I was under a strict guard and while I wasn't injured, I was exhausted and would rather sleep than try and get away. Honestly, I was practically dead on my feet, if you'll excuse the phrase. At this point, I was beyond frustrated. It took a surprisingly short time for the pyre to be completed. As I was brought to the stake, I once again addressed the congregation before me. I didn't plead or beg, just repeated that this was going to hurt them a lot more than it would hurt me. There wasn't anything I could do to stop what was about to happen. If they wanted pain, then so be it.

This priest apparently had a short fuse, and screamed for the demon (me, I guess) to shut up. That I was only saying this because the other two priests had inflicted enough damage that I could finally be hurt. He grabbed my wrists roughly, wincing as he did so and ignoring the beginnings of a bruise rising on his own wrists. But he seemed quite happy to see that my hands were stilled somewhat scraped up. The villagers didn't seem to be as confident. At least they were getting wiser. Despite his show of triumph, he still ordered someone else to tie my to the stake and others still to light torches and bring them to the kindling. As they did, the leaves in trees near by shook and the branches bent.

I don't know if you know this, and it's probably better if you're hearing this for the first time. But burning at the stake can take awhile. As the pyre lights and the flames dance towards you the heat quickly turns from a gentle warmth to unbearable heat. I can only imagine how it would feel watching it spread as the kindling crackles knowing that only seconds separate you from indescribable pain. As I watched the smoke waft towards me it was swiftly swept away by the wind. I heard the priest begin to take small involuntary gasps. I'm sure if I could see him through rising blaze, I would see the sweat building on his brow. And then the screaming started.

The smoke should have killed him first, but the wind kept stealing away the possibility of faster death. While I could hear the screams over the roar of the inferno around me, the gradually got easier to ignore... I'm not proud of that. That I've learned to ignore the suffering of those around me. I couldn't see much through the fire, so I finally let myself rest and process how I got into this whole mess.

Honestly looking back on it, I don't think the villagers anger towards me was really all that justified. Actually scratch that, it wasn't justified at all and considering the last few days, it isn't all that surprising. I had arrived at the village just two days ago after walking for hours on end, and had just helped myself to a warm meal before setting back out on my travels - I knew well enough that people didn't take kindly to me once they learned that I was different. But, still they had seen what happened. I don't think there was any logic behind thinking that I had been at fault. The guy had come at me with a knife, had come after all of us. There didn't seem to be much reason behind it, only madness fueled by drink and a blinded by self-pity.  I don't hold any malice towards those touched with madness, and I ran more for his sake than my own fear. The villagers were running too. I hadn't had much time to react when I first saw the armed man coming after me, but I turned quickly enough. As I took a few steps away from him, I felt the phantom pain of a dagger slice through my back and the chill of pain being transferred. I heard the man stumble and cry out.

I would have kept running. Looking at how things turned out, perhaps it would have been the lesser evil to keep running. But there was a child, frozen in fear, defenseless, and all alone... So, I stopped, grabbed the kid, and wrapped my body around his small frame to make it impossible for this man to hurt him while he rampaged. The kid fought back at first, reacting out of blind terror before realizing that I was a shield between him and the real enemy. It didn't seem like a real sacrifice to do so... I mean this man couldn't really hurt me. To his credit he certainly tried to.

I don't really know how many times he stabbed me. I don't know why he didn't give up and try to find an easier target. I don't know why he didn't stop after he realized that the only blood he drew was his own. All I know is that the ground drank its fill before he finally collapsed. Once I heard him fall I slowly looked up. The villagers must have stopped running awhile ago. They had gathered in a loose, cautious circle around us. I looked back down at the child, told him to close his eyes, and picked him up making sure to keep his head turned away from the still bleeding corpse. Tentatively I asked whose he was. No one stepped forward. I asked again, and a shaken young girl spoke up that she was his older sister. As I brought him to her, the crowd shirked back. I told the child I had been guarding that it was over as I put him down. He immediately grabbed his sisters hands and finally ran, dragging his sister with him.

Maybe I shouldn't have tried to play everything off so casually. If I had just run then maybe everything could have been avoided. But I think I was a bit in shock. While I wasn't hurt, knowing that someone was trying their best to kill you and hearing them die was pretty off-putting. Or... I guess I should say it used to be. By the time that I thought about making a hasty get away someone had called for the priests. He immediately spun the whole event into my fault. Saying that I had cursed the attacker, or given him a demonic blade which had caused him to lose his senses. It guess it didn't matter that you could still smell the alcohol despite the thick stench of blood. I hadn't wanted anyone to get hurt if I resisted, so I let them shackle my wrists. I figured that the truth would come out soon enough. That the fact that the only casualty had been one trying to cause harm. How fucking naive.

I don't know why I'm the way I am and that's not for lack of trying. Over the years, I've consulted apothecary's and traveling mages in secret. Each one gave me an answer for the origin of my condition and left convinced they were right. All of them seemed so confident in their diagnosis that I would have believed them, if not for the fact that they all came up with different reasons. ""Oh! I know,"" they would say after a long pause, ""one of your parents, or one of your ancestors, or in a past life *you* were actually fae."" Or, ""while I can sense that you believe you're telling the truth about never studying magic, you must have dabbled with the dark arts and now can't remember."" My favorite - despite the political target it paints on my back - is that my parents made a deal with the devil and suffered a terrible price to ensure that I would never be harmed. Doesn't matter that they're both living peacefully in the valley eight leagues from the pyre I'm bound within.

The embers had started to die at my feet and the charred corpse of the newly appointed head priest had finally stopped screaming. I guess he had been the one with the most ill-will towards me. That's not to say that the torch bearers who had lit the kindling which once surrounded me were in much better condition. The fact that they were alive indicated that they had been following orders more out fear of repercussion from their church rather than malice towards me. But still, portions of their flesh had melted and the curse they had brought upon themselves appeared to prevent them from escaping their pain by passing out. It was clear that none of them would ever fully recover and it was questionable if they would even live long enough to heal. It was a grizzly sight. I assume if they ever took action to hurt me again, they wouldn't survive. Hatred and malice often seems to be fueled by pain, and they had certainly had their fill.

I stepped away from the post I had been tied to, the bindings had long disintegrated in the flames. The moment I crossed the threshold of the burnt circle, the torch bearers finally tasted the relief of unconsciousness. I casually felt my wrists and counted myself lucky that they weren't even chaffed. I guess the one who bound me hadn't tried to be gentle. It's strange how bittersweet it is to be hated. The palpable resentment these villagers felt towards me ironically made it impossible for even one of them to hurt me. And despite that... I felt more bored with my predicament than anything else. My apathy was disconcerting, this predicament should  bother me - it certainly would have before.

It's kind of odd how jaded I had gotten in the last few days, I guess being the focal point of public executions will do that to you. I mean at this point I've absolved myself of guilt. I warned them that this would happen. I can get not believing it at first. It would be crazy to believe it. But, after watching their head priest of 20 years keel over, limbs held tight at his sides, and coughing up an endless stream of water before gargling into submission and letting death take him; you would think that they would get that this was serious. Things may have been salvageable if they had spared the chains before tossing me into the lake. As it was, it took too long to free myself before the man had been sentenced to the fate he had attempted to force upon me. Then again, escaping drowning apparently proves one to be a witch - so I guess it was inevitable that they would try and kill me again.

Maybe the decision to not tell you was a mix of her parents  influencing the decision (I'm assuming it was a Christian wedding and maybe they thought you wouldn't want to be included in what they saw as a religious event) ?Not to say that this is a great / excusable rational - because its still hella fucked up. Just trying to not assume the worst, you know. 

I think it would be good to contact her. Like not blow-up at her or anything - although anger would be justified in this situation.

depression,fjpg8dy,t3_feldda,1583549985.0,"Tldr; it's a long process and takes a multifaceted approach. Depends on where you are / what level of suicidal ideation you're in (annoying interruptions, constantly being thought about, essentially on the level of compulsion that you are fighting with every molecule of your being, etc). Process includes: Redirecting negative self talk, therapy, listing good things about yourself, practicing hella patience with yourself, capturing and really trying to hold onto good events, get a friend to promise to do something horribly rude to your family at your funeral if you do kill yourself, medication, switching up belief systems, etc. 

In my experience, it can take a long time. I was diagnosed with depression about 8 years ago but have had suicidal ideation for at least 13 years. I still have moments where I am dealing with suicidal ideation on the brink of  compulsion, but it's much less frequent and much more manageable. My struggle with depression has been a real process, and at points hasn't been the healthiest - so please only take from this what seems like it could be helpful and healthy for you.

When I was younger, I used to measure how long a continuous suicidal inclination lasted. I would tell myself to get through the next day and see if it was better, if it lasted longer reach out for help or connect with family/friends in a meaningful way. Anytime I wasn't actively thinking about hurting myself, no matter if it was only for a moment, I would re-start my 'clock' and force myself to keep waiting. My mantra for a few years was honestly ""Death comes to those who wait"" lol. My life kind of de-railed for a bit, some shit happened, and I started manifesting some strong symptoms of PTSD. To get through this, I compromised with my suicidal ideation and took up smoking as a way to kill myself slowly enough that I would have time to stop the process if/when I was mentally healthy enough to do so... Not the healthiest nor advisable path, but also kept me here long enough to begin the process of quitting in earnest and I doubt I'd be here without that compromise... so, yeah... 

About 3 years ago, I began shutting down negative self-talk and responding to each suicidal thought by listing at least 3 things that I found fulfillment in, thought was valuable about myself, or wanted to stick around for. I tried to make sure that each time I had to go through this process, at least one of the things I listed felt true. This was really hard at the beginning because the thoughts were hella intrusive and on a constant loop so I was constantly trying to come up with good attributes for myself. Part of the hard part of this technique was recognizing when I was having a negative or suicidal thought. 

Doing this took a bit of discipline and a lot of patience with myself. I found that this process helped greatly decrease how automatic and continuous my suicidal ideation is - however I do still have moments when suicide and self-mutilation is suddenly the only thing I can think about (#triggered, by what? no idea). Those moments are hard to break out of and usually require me to stop what I'm doing, breathe through it, and try and refocus on the present and my reasons for staying. 

I think what has been most helpful for me, is being fully theoretically resolved to not take my life. This is helpful because the suicidal thoughts start to lose power and become more annoying than anything else. I also have a really good friend who has promised / threatened me that he would piss on my grave or in my open casket at my funeral if I killed myself. He's 100% the type of person who would do that... and it has been a helpful deterrent at times b/c I don't want my fam to have to deal with him whipping out his dick on top of everything else.  

I've also found that changing up my beliefs has helped. I used to find solace in Christianity and then nihilism and now rebirth. I hold these beliefs in a very agnostic sense (like I'm 100% sure that my beliefs aren't the full story of what's going on in the world). But my current ""belief"" in rebirth helps me feel like suicide is futile and giving in would compound my depression onto the next version of my self... idk. That's not to say you should change your religion or anything, just that I found switching things up helpful for me. 

Also, therapy. Once you've found a therapist who clicks, it can be v beneficial. And meds... those can help too. And tattoos... but that might just be a me thing. I also have a journal where I write down things which have been effective towards improving my mental health so that I don't forget what works when my brain is trying to kill me. 

Good luck"

I'm sorry that things are shit right now and that you're dealing with this shitty condition. It's hard to stay and it takes a lot of courage to stay. When I gets hard, I try and remember things that I can look forward to - a movie or book that isn't out yet that I think could be cool, a  show that I haven't finished, something that I want to experience, thinking about my siblings have a kid down the road who might want to know me as more than a relayed memory, a tattoo that I think would be cool to get one day, waiting to watch the leaves change color, etc. I've also found that cynical humor has been helpful for me - laughing at my own pain doesn't make things stop hurting but it can help release some serotonin.

depression,fhk2myt,t3_f3j59r,1581664146.0,"I'm a bit older than you (23), but I remember feeling the same when I was 16. I had actually planned for years that 16 would be the oldest I would get. I didn't want my family to know about what I was dealing with too. I realized though that if I killed myself, my family would know that I was depressed anyway. So I decided to let them know and give them the opportunity to help. Looking back, I wish I had reached out sooner. 

I'm not gonna lie, the first therapist they sent me to was kind of shitty. But seeing the effort that my parents put in to help keep me going was helpful in motivating me to stay around. I found better therapists in college and gained more positive coping mechanisms too. As someone who has lived through some pretty dark mental times... I'm not going to say it gets better (mostly b/c I  know how much I hated that phrase growing up), but it does get more manageable. I'm still on the same rollercoaster and the downs still suck, but I find myself on the upswings more often than not.  I know how to manage my dark periods better now and I can better identify when my brain is going to start its plummet so that I can be better prepared for it and stop the spiral sooner. 

Idk if this is helpful in any way. But I'm rooting for you. Dealing with this shit can be exhausting, but  hiding what you're going through can make it even tougher. You don't have to let your parents in completely, but letting them know that you would appreciate help or some sense of understanding with what you're dealing with usually goes pretty well. 

Wishing you all the best"
depression,fhk1ods,t3_f3ekd7,1581663028.0,"tldr; some options are 1) redirect your energy into something more productive, 2) breathe through it, and 3) reflect on what works for you. No matter what; meet yourself where you are, try not to get discouraged/overly frustrated, and try your best to take steps forwards towards processing through your emotions in a constructive way. 

\-

Sometimes getting into exercise is a good way to get that energy out in a more productive way. Running fucking sucks, but it can serve a purpose and can sometimes help clear your mind / give yourself time to process through what you're feeling. Also, at least for me, running hurts (probs cause I'm overweight and smoked for 5 years lol) - pushing through the pain (both mental and physical) can be a good metaphor for pushing through depression. 

There's other things too, like if you have access to gym with punching bags and have gloves - boxing has been really therapeutic for me in the past. You can do timed sets with burpies/planks/crunches in between each set. And you just keep going until you feel like you can't and then you do one more set. Usually, afterwards I'm too tired and drained to really think about anything other than getting more water, taking a shower, or taking a nap lol

I feel like exercise is a good way to funnel a desire for inflicting pain in a way which is more productive for your body. Of course, it's good to be careful and to make working out isn't something you do just to hurt yourself. Also you shouldn't exercise with the goal to really hurt yourself, rather exercise is an opportunity to feel pain in a good way... if that make's sense. It's a good balance to keep up a routine so that you're exercising when you in a more mentally stable mindset too. If you're really into this method, it could even help you motivate yourself when you are in a self-injury spiral - like instead of scratching or chocking myself now, I'm gonna push myself to do 30 sit ups either in the moment or the next time I'm working out. 

\----

The other option is to just try and breathe through it. I usually acknowledge that I'm thinking these things and then give myself a firm no and try and think about good things about myself / why I'm worth not hurting myself. It doesn't fully matter if you believe the good things that you're telling yourself - in time and with practice you might find yourself in a mindset when you do believe it.  In my experience, this method takes a shit ton of time to actually become truly effective. But it does help re-train the brain to stop constantly thinking about self-injury / suicidal ideation. 

Also any progress towards resisting self-injury is progress towards stopping self-injury. You have to work with where you are now, if stopping completely isn't possible in this moment of your life make sure you have neosporen and sterile bandages.  If you're using ""tools"" to hurt yourself, it would be good to also make sure that they are sterile and it would probably be good to get a tetanus shot. 

Journaling and drawing can also be helpful. I've found it to be most helpful when I include entries which have little tips on things that worked / were helpful for me to manage my depression in a positive way."

depression,fhjolhb,t3_f3i0rj,1581651390.0,"I unfortunately can't offer a diagnosis and I don't think that its the best move to accept any diagnosis that someone offers via the internet. I would advise you to go to a professional (counselor, therapist, psychologist, doctor) to talk about diagnosis. 

However, not having a diagnosis doesn't invalidate what you're experiencing. It does sound like something is going on and it's really good that you are self-aware and noticing that things don't feel right. I would recommend working with where you're at and trying not to beat yourself up over not being able to accomplish everything you think you should. 

If taking a shower is too much, break it down (ex: see if you can wash your face instead). If eating a meal all at once isn't working, save what you didn't eat and try again in an hour - even a bite is progress. While it can be extremely frustrating to break down tasks which were once effortless, and I'm talking from experience, it still builds resolve towards providing your body what it needs. 

Sometimes overanalyzing why you aren't doing something is counterproductive. Instead, focus on what you want to gain from doing a certain thing. By thinking about the positives associated with a task, it can sometimes propel you into action. If you still can't do something, don't beat yourself up and try and avoid negative thought spirals; remember to breathe and now that you can try again later. Try and view every small step (eating one bite, getting out of bed - even if you have just rolled onto the floor, changing clothes, etc) as a step in the right direction to getting back to where you want to be."

I've recently committed myself to internalizing the meanings so I can rely less on the guides. One method that I have found helpful is by organizing my deck by suits and going through each card by studying and recording what I think the imagery indicates the meaning to be; writing what the guide says the meaning is; and then brainstorming an experience(s) that I feel exemplifies the meaning. 

I've also heard that internalizing what the numbers mean can be really helpful as well (and would take less time than going through each card). 

I have 2 decks (Rider and Animal Wisdom) which don't seem to really like each other lol. But since I've started doing this work, they seem to complement each other more. I also learned that their respective guides sometimes have competing or completely opposite meanings - so it makes sense that they clashed at first. (for instance the Star in Rider indicates loss, theft, abandonment ... and sometimes hope; whereas my it indicates beauty, hope, guidance, peace, and harmony in my Animal Wisdom deck). I now do spreads using both of them in order to foster teamwork and to prevent favoritism towards either since I feel a strong connection to both. 

It's honestly slow and long work, but it's been really helpful. Even when I don't remember the meanings of the cards I've studied, I still feel an intuitive sense or emotion which helps me interpret the overall spreads as I consult the guide / my working document.  

I'm only focusing on upright meanings, and pretty much all the cards I've been pulling recently from my Animal Wisdom deck have been reversed \*sigh. So I still have a long way to go."

That I was relaxed and happy and able to look into the darkness of night and feel comforted rather than alone. The moment was really short, but I remember it extremely well. This was a moment worth waiting for and fighting for. And if I continue to wait and fight, maybe I can have another.

The program is an intense full-time 1 year program and you can opt to do a 2-year program if you're juggling a job while getting the degree. You can either do 400 hours from a GIS internship or defend a thesis to complete the program. 

I brought up ESRI, because we had a few guest speakers come from there. They introduced very powerful software updates and new applications which were to be rolled out to the general public soon. I stated that ESRI seems to have blinders towards ethical considerations of how their products could easily be used in ways they didn't intend because they couldn't answer ethic-based questions. I found it frustrating that there were no classes on ethics in the masters program at all. Instead we were learning how to use a powerful tool without going over or at least considering how ethics were at play. 

Sorry that I hit a sore spot with the smart tech. I still stand by my opinion, but it clearly pissed you off so I'm sorry that I triggered you. 

PS I keep up with my classmates as much I want to. I'm not squandering any opportunities that I would want to pursue."
gis,f77n7vy,t3_dulc08,1573465677.0,"So, I've taken all the coursework required to get a Masters of GIS just working on my internship hours now. Coursework included database management, programming, spatial thinking/analysis, remote sensing, drone workshops, spatial statistics, project management and understanding how to use existing GIS software (in our case ESRI products). GIS can be applied to anything, so I would recommend thinking about how you want to apply it before pursuing a masters in it. Advisors will be able to help you out more and figure out what coursework applies most to your situation if you know what you want to do with it. 

From my understanding, having a general understanding of GIS will be useful in whatever field you want to go into. However, I know that graduate programs that are not purely about GIS include coursework which has trains you to use GIS for that specific field. It might be more helpful to look into graduate programs which offer courses which integrate GIS into a particular field of study that you are interested in, rather than a generalized GIS masters which makes you a jack of all trades, master of none. 

I had a bit of crisis of identity during my one-year masters program which made me really question how I really wanted to apply my degree in the future. Now I don't really know how I'm going to integrate GIS into my future career... which isn't a great place to be. The program I was in was really closely affiliated with ESRI and I became kind of scared of new technology in general. This was due to my interpretation of ESRI as a cult of personality which seemed blinded to how their products could be used by people who didn't have the purest of intentions. Also had an instructor who welcomed having smart tech in his home, which caused me to question his credentials since everything I've read about smart tech is that it invites security breaches. 

I haven't kept in good contact with my classmates, but last I heard only one or two people had gotten a job which incorporated GIS. They also had a lot of previous experience in specialized fields of study. 

If you want to demonstrate proficiency in GIS, I would first chose a field of study it can be applied in. Then seek graduate programs for that field of study which included coursework and possible certification for GIS in that particular field. I would also look into getting a drone license. From my understanding you don't even need to have flown a drone in order to get a license, but it is a valuable certification that companies are looking for and can be valuable for gathering remote sensing imagery to be used in GIS analysis."
Witch,f77k9gl,t3_duaal3,1573460904.0,"So I read the linked article twice and I'm still a bit confused. Not really about pets not automatically fulfilling historic definitions of a familiar, but about the line ""to have a familiar is to be possessed by a familiar""...

I'm really new to all of this and was raised in the Christian faith. While I don't identify with the Christian religion anymore, I accept that this philosophy affects my worldview and how I read this. Does possession refer to the Christian sense of having another spirit cohabiting your physical body? So a familiar could have either a realistic physical form or just ride along in your own body? 

I'm just a bit confused. Mostly because I kind of feel like something spiritual is around me / I keep having strange burning sensations and find faint scratch marks on my back. Could that be a familiar then... or would that be something else that I might need to pursue getting rid of (which honestly, intuitively doesn't feel like something I truly want to do). idk... just never thought about if this phenomena could be attributed to having a familiar.

Dreams,f6osbsb,t3_dsawqa,1573032226.0,"Was she emotionally manipulative/abusive? If so, could be that your subconscious is still trying to tell you that the damage she did has had lingering effects on your psyche. I don't know really anything about your personal situation (also don't really want to/need to, boundaries are hella important especially on the internet), so I'm sorry if this is way off base. But if she attempted to promise that a future with her would include a happy family (kids/pets), financial stability (large house), etc and all you had to do would be put up with toxic behavior it kind of make sense to me that the dream would end on a very passive aggressive note. 

It sounds like you know that you don't want to be with her and that you are healthier without her. It might be good to meditate on how/if she may have damaged your psyche and if there are still mental/emotional hurdles you have to break down in order to be fully trusting and emotionally available to your current partner. Maybe being in such a good relationship and (I assume) allowing this person in past emotional walls, triggered you subconscious to bring up this past situation b/c it's worried you could be hurt in a similar way again.

LucidDreaming,f6oqbbb,t3_ds9j4v,1573029209.0,"My reality check centers around reading. In dreams I can read books, signs, labels, etc (however some people can't read at all). If I look away from the text and then back down, the words (while still readable) are different."
Dreams,f6opz3r,t3_ds7x57,1573028730.0,"I've found that I experiencing reading differently in dreams than irl. I've heard that for a lot of people if they try to read something it is complete gibberish. For me, there is actual text but if I look away and then look back, the words have changed. Make it common practice to constantly check for things to read when you're awake, after awhile you may start checking in dreams as well. Once you realize that you can't read something or if the text on a label/book change after you look away, you'll realize that you're dreaming. 

I came up with this technique during a moderate mental break when I was unsure of whether I was locked in a dream / in a coma / dead or something. So for a period of time (during a very stressful part of my life) I was obsessively checking labels in order to see if the waking reality I experienced was real or not / a dream or not.  It was during this 1 - 1 1/2 years that I was able to lucid dream fairly consistently. 

I'm assuming that you won't be as neurotic about checking labels/books/anything with words on them as I was, but I'm sure that if you make it a point to double check if you can read or not you will eventually be able to lucid dream. 

(Also, lucid dreaming isn't always great. Sometimes it can be frustrating and annoying. For example, I once fell asleep right after turning my alarm off. I knew that I was dreaming and that I should be awake. I could hear my third alarm going off but couldn't wake up. My dream ended up with me essentially miming my morning routine and waiting between each task, and yelling at my body to wake up. Ended up having to redo my entire morning routine when I finally woke up and feeling very frustrated about the whole thing.)"
depression_help,f6oostj,t3_ds9iyk,1573026995.0,"You definitely shouldn't feel like a jerk from getting tired or frustrated about feeling worn out from this! I would advice setting boundaries with how much time you are willing to give up to help her on a personal level. Especially class time! 

From what you've said, it seems like she doesn't feel comfortable talking her mental health struggles with others. I wouldn't be surprised if she is almost releasing an emotional dam when she's around you because she isn't able to communicate these feelings and thoughts to others in her life. Unfortunately, it seems like she may be used to ignoring her thoughts/emotions in order to put on a brave face in front of others. Because of this, she doesn't know how to handle these thoughts in a positive way when her mask slips. While unfortunate and (I assume not intentional), she seems to be falling into a trap of being emotionally manipulative towards you. Boundaries will help prevent you from being manipulated into a self-compromising position. 

I would attempt to approach her with understanding and compassion. Try and take note of things that you appreciate about her and things that she gets right. Point these positive things out to her when she starts a mental spiral. It sounds like you are already doing that. 

Make sure that you are giving yourself what you need. When you need a break, communicate very gently that you have to focus on your work for the present moment. 

If you're willing to share notes with her and get together / stay in contact when doing assignments - tell her that you are willing to do so. When she asks you to comfort her the bathroom, tell her that you have to stay in class and that she will benefit in the long term with you being away from her (because you will have lecture notes and she'll be able to know what she missed). If you are willing to put together a list of resources or self comforting exercises, it may be beneficial for both of you to do that. 

In the end, you need to look out for yourself and do everything you can to reach your own goals. The only person who can truly help her and do the necessary work is herself.  Reassuring her that she is not worthless, that she can do these things, that you see her as a smart/worthwhile/caring/kind person can be helpful but, in order to be truly successful, she needs to be able to see these things in herself. Your top priority needs to be yourself and your education. 

Let me know if you would appreciate a bulleted list of some self-comforting exercises or resources that may relate to her situation and I'll try and get back to you in the comments when I can.

tarot,f6on1wd,t3_ds93nw,1573024560.0,"The ten of wands can indicate both necessary struggle and taking on extra burdens. In this type of reading, I would view it as acknowledging that every relationship takes work, however you may be shouldering more of the burden that your partner. This card can also indicate completion/nearing completion. 

The Fool indicates new beginnings and a free spirit. Could indicate a draw towards putting the burden of this relationship down and starting afresh. 

Death indicates change, endings, and transformation. 

To me, this combination reads as having 2 possibilities: 

1) Get out this relationship, there is an uneven burden to make it work placed on you. The figure in the 10 of wands is depicted alone in their struggle. Leaving the relationship will allow you be focus on yourself and allow yourself to focus on what you want. Changes have to be made, allowing the romantic relationship to die is the path forward. 

2) There needs to be a redistribution of how much work is going into keeping this relationship together. Your partner needs to take on more responsibility in keeping the relationship alive (if that's what you both want), they cannot simply allow you to carry the burden alone. This change would happen via communication and would need to be followed up by action on their part. 

I'm leaning towards the first interpretation. Either way, change is inevitable and very necessary. Try meditating on what you want out of this portion of your life (without considering your partner and what they want from you / for you / from a relationship). Meditate on if what you want is compatible with the relationship as it currently is. If not, meditate on what conditions would have to be in place (and how much time you would allow for those conditions to be met) for you to feel like it is not a burden. Either communicate these conditions, wait a bit, and re-evaluate or get out now."
depression_help,f6olttr,t3_dsatnx,1573022977.0,"I feel you. I've been working on redirecting my thoughts away from suicidal ideation as well. What I've found helpful is a kind of process: 

* Actively recognize that you've had the thought / what your thinking
   * Try and observe it as something separate than yourself and your personal goals
   * Over time you may realize that these thoughts are brought up by certain triggers, some of which you may be able to avoid or mitigate - for ex, drinking can be a trigger for me
* Take a deep breath and imagine pushing the thought away from you as you exhale
* Extend compassion towards yourself - ex if the thought lasts 3 seconds counter it with 15 seconds of thinking supportive things about yourself
   * Sometimes I'll have a mental blip during these attempts at addressing these thoughts, and another bout of suicidal ideation can be triggered. I try and firmly tell these thoughts no, take another deep breath, and once again extend compassionate thoughts towards myself
* Remind yourself of things you enjoy, are looking forward to, are grateful for, etc. 
* Rinse and repeat

Know that rewiring your brain and how it responds can take time. Try not to get too frustrated if you aren't seeing as much progress as you want. I now try and view each time I have these thoughts as a training opportunity for strengthening healthy coping mechanisms. I view this process as essentially building a wall between me and suicidal ideation. At the beginning, it was extremely difficult but over time it has become an instant response when I have these thoughts. 

Hope this helps somewhat, I'm rooting for you. Good luck and all the best."

Dreams,f672olv,t1_f664dj2,1572715993.0,"Our situations are a bit different. You know when you're awake and when you're dreaming in a present moment, but then can't remember which memories are from dreams and which are not. I brought up my situation because I found that I experience reading (and by extension, writing) differently in dreams. So I tried to brainstorm something which may help you out which included reading/writing - ergo a journal or planner that you fill out throughout the day which includes things you did. So for the example you gave, you could check back and see if you recorded having a conversation with your friend or not."
Dreams,f63q4tf,t3_dqfygo,1572681568.0,"It might help to write down reflections about your day or use a journal to write in during the day as things happen (maybe make it a habit to jot down a few concrete memories during meals?). Even if you end up doing this in a dream too, the thing you wrote down in a dream won't appear in your real life journal. 

A few years ago, I was dissociating heavily and not sleeping a lot so I wasn't always sure if I was dreaming or not in any present moment. I had learned previously that while I could read in dreams, if I looked away and then back at the words they would have changed. I got used to checking whether I was dreaming or not, by constantly finding things to read and then testing whether I was dreaming or not using this method. I found that this helped ground me in ""reality"" and I've gradually stopped checking if I'm in a dream or not as consistently as I used to. 

I wonder if writing things you are sure happened in reality in the same journal whenever you question if you're remembering a dream or not can help ground you in a similar way. It could even be helpful to include concrete details like the time, date, place, and reason you are there. Getting your brain to recognize and record these details as something different than a dreamscape may train it to store dream memories in a different, distinct place."
Dreams,f63na1m,t1_f63dmce,1572680241.0,"Can astral police appear almost like guides? I had a dream once where I was meeting a lot of people from my past. I kept telling them that *we* were dreaming. It didn't feel like I was the one making them appear in my dream, but more like I was shifting and finding other dreamers who were in an almost liminal space between dreams where people could just chill between actual dreams. A guy I didn't know came up to me and told me that I had to stop telling people they were dreaming. I was a bit belligerent I guess and I suddenly ""woke up"" in a dream version of my apartment. 

The same guy was there and I told him, again, that I was dreaming. I continued ""waking up"" in the dream apartment, finding the guy, informing him that this was a dream and then being waking up in my ""apartment"" (all the while my apartment was getting larger and larger until it was basically a mansion). It felt almost like a test and it ended when I forgot that I was dreaming - although I must have passed part of the test because when I found him again he asked if I was dreaming. 

I think I said no and he sighed then guided me up a fire-escape (which is when I remembered that this was a dream). The fire-escape lead to an area that was supported by clouds I guess (the ground was white and the sky was white). The area was full of games (arcades / rope courses ect) where other dreamers were competing. I asked what they were competing for and he said ""in dream currency"". Essentially there was a buy-in to play the games and a betting component on who would win. I asked what was the point of ""in dream currency"" and he guided me to an area protected by a golden fence filled with gift boxes of varying sizes. The boxes held dreams which past-reincarnations had bought which held information which could guide future incarnations. 

The freaky part was that all but one game was being played. It was the only game that didn't require in-dream currency to play and kind of looked like an arcade game (think pack man but without any joysticks/controllers). I asked what the deal with it was. He said or showed me that dreamers could essentially bet their life on it. If someone played it, the were teleported into the game. In order to win the game, they had to realize that they were trapped in a dream. But the game was designed to feel extremely real and you would forget everything which happened before you had entered it. I woke up before I asked what the reward for winning this game got you - I think I just assumed that it would be a large amount of in-dream currency. However, I got the feeling that if you failed to realize that you were in a dream you would be stuck in a coma and trapped until you either realized that it was a dream or died. 

When I woke up I was shocked that I had only been asleep for maybe 30-45minutes. It feels like my performance in knowing whether I was in a dream or not allowed me some access behind the veil and to some information. However, my guide / astral police did not leave my side once. My access to that realm felt more like an orientation tour and I don't think I've managed to get back to that level. I'm hoping that this guide is still around and monitoring me so that I can learn more."

depression,f4zfwnn,t3_dm2oe0,1571906135.0,"Bear with me, I promise this metaphor will tie together into a response to your question. I'm really into Lord of the Rings and I feel like the way Sam and Frodo interact with each other throughout the series can be helpful in illuminating how people deal with heavy mental burdens and how someone (who is not experiencing that same burden) can support someone who is. 

In the series, Frodo carries a ring which essentially brings psychological torment upon himself. The goal is to destroy the ring, and the author makes it clear that Frodo is the only one who can carry the burden of taking the ring to the place it can be destroyed. In the first book of the trilogy, Frodo makes the decision to isolate himself from a group of protectors who are meant to aid him on his journey. However, Sam (a childhood friend) refuses to let him  take the long path alone. Sam doesn't seem to do much (he's not a fighter and he's not that skilled in anything except cooking) - but he walks the path that his friend must take. 

He see's the horrors that his friend is destined to see. But since he does not carry the ring, he has a clearer mind. He is able to give Frodo moments of comedic relief and bring levity to the bleak situation they find themselves in throughout the second and third book. Near the end of their journey, Frodo is unable walk any further. Sam knows he cannot take the ring upon himself (the same as how someone cannot take the burden of depression away from suffering with it). It is in this moment that he speaks one of the most iconic lines in the trilogy: ""I can't carry it for you, *but I can carry you*"". He carries Frodo until Frodo is able to walk again and continue on his path. 

I'll stop the metaphor here. What I learned from this analysis is:

1. Know that you cannot take this affliction away from your daughter, no matter how much you try. 

2) When they try and isolate themselves, refuse to leave them completely alone - as in continue to show you support them and love them, no matter the anger / outbursts they display (these are symptoms of depression and not fully indicative of how they truly feel about you). Get aquatinted with her friends and give them your number - don't press them for information, but know that she may feel more comfortable with being candid about what she's going through with them. Hopefully in this way, if they are concerned about her wellbeing they will reach out to you in some way.

3) The path of trying to support someone with depression can be dark and sometimes it will feel like there is no hope (often why people will try and isolate themselves - they don't want to force you to walk this path with them). 

4) Reassure them that you are *choosing* to walk this path with them. You do not feel coerced or bear resentment towards them for the state of affairs you may find yourself in 

5) Sometimes it will feel like you are not making a difference, sometimes you will feel powerless - however you are having a large impact on giving them reasons to keep fighting and surviving. Let this give you hope when you do not feel like you are doing enough

6) There may come a point, God forbid, that the burden is too heavy for them to bear - at that point do what you can to carry them closer to safety (hospital stay / emergency therapy appointment / etc). 

\-----

It sounds like you are an amazing, loving father. Do your best and know that you are human, there is only so much you can do. There is only so much that you can know about what your daughter is going through. This is not your fault. Your efforts will not go unnoticed in the long term. And if your daughter does ever ask you why you didn't ""do more"", respond that you did what you knew to do, that you approached her situation with love, that you tried and that you are human and are sorry that you didn't know how to do more. 

The path is hard and difficult, your daughter may not open up to you now. Just let her know that she is loved more than she can imagine and that you are willing to walk with her and support her no matter the bleak environments she finds herself in. Your efforts may not seem like enough, but they may make all the difference.

gis,f48pmmn,t1_f48ha7p,1571445331.0,">hy would unfamiliar people go to a conference?? Wasted a day going to that crap.

I got a ""free"" pass to go to the San Diego one when I was getting my Masters in GIS (included in tuition). Found it really weird that it was called the user conference when the 2 major users of ESRI products (Department of Defense and Oil/Petroleum companies) where not prominently represented. Saw no mention of oil at all and there was one small booth for the military in the expo hall. The keynote panel was with Jane Goodall and E.O. Wilson and the major theme of the conference was essentially how ArcGIS could save the environment and the world. Talk about skewing results by essentially erasing the two largest clients who definitely have major influence in how ESRI develops their tools and software."

depression,f35w4z8,t3_dfu5bl,1570693931.0,"Damn, that's rough. I've also grappled with these types of thoughts. It's difficult and hard to deal with. As to your question, why, I don't really know. For me, sometimes it feels like there's not a reason, sometimes it's anxiety/stress related, sometimes it feels wrong that I can be experiencing so much internal pain and it not be visible. Sometimes I wonder if it's because a part of me feels that I deserve to suffer and be in pain...

I've had to do a lot of work in realizing and internalizing that I don't have to make myself suffer more than I already am. That the pain is valid without having visible scars. That the urge to hurt myself isn't coming from a rational part of my brain, but a reactionary emotional part. 

But these realizations don't feel real when I'm in the middle of grappling with self destructive impulses. It's hard and knowing things logically doesn't make dealing with these thoughts any less difficult in the moment. 

In short, the reasons for having these thoughts can be (in my experience) endless. Sometimes there isn't a clear reason and it can be hard to know what triggered them in the first place. 

PS. I've learned of a few healthy coping mechanisms which have helped me and other people out when trying to handle self destructive thoughts. Let me know if you would be interested in me posting a list of them. Know that some random stranger on the internet is rooting for you! All the best."
tarot,f35vao5,t3_dftfcq,1570692617.0,"I'll ground and center myself while deciding what spread I want to do. Sometimes I'll set an intent for the reading or state that the message the deck sends me comes from a place of love and in alignment with a higher universal power which has my best interests in mind.   

Then I shuffle 3x, cut the deck into 3 piles and then combine the piles back into 1. I repeat this process 2 times. If I'm going to lay the cards into a spread I'm not used to, I say the spread out loud (ex: card 1 -  past, card 2 - present, card 3- future) and visualize how the cards will placed. My cards are kind of large and awkward so I shuffle with them almost parallel with each other so that the edges are crossing and then just push the cards together at the end of each shuffle. If I know the spread well, I'll simply focus on my intent for the reading. 

I've found visualization of the spread really useful with one of my decks b/c I use the visual cues to help with my reading. However, I only started doing this b/c I felt lead to with this particular deck. ex: if the card drawn for me has a person looking to the left while the card drawn for where the universe wants me to be is looking to the right, I'll take that to mean that I'm currently pursuing things that aren't in line with the direction the universe wants me to go. 

Also if a card falls out during the shuffling process, I will read it immediately and treat it like a clarification card. I usually take note of what it was and the message it may be sending before adding it back to the deck and proceeding with my shuffling process. 

It's great to look for guidance in how you read and interact with your cards. But the most important thing is to be lead by your own intuition. Feel free to try this and other methods out; but know there is no wrong way to shuffle your cards or choose which cards to pull for your spread. Trust yourself and trust your deck :)"

tarot,f34vwqb,t1_f34n74b,1570661996.0,"The first thing that I see, is that this reading is quite significant. This is because all 3 of the cards are considered major arcana. Each deck has 56 minor arcana split between 4 suits (wands/cups/swords/pentacles) and 22 major arcana - total of 78 cards. Getting 3 major arcana in a row has a probability of roughly 8% - my math  (22/78)\^2. That's without going into the probability of getting major arcana which directly relate to the question asked (in this case, witchiness: intuition, magic, being in touch with a higher power). So this tells me that the question asked and the decks answer is significant to the querent.

This spread essentially are saying that the querent has immense inner strength, essentially as it pertains to the spiritual, and is very intuitive/in sync with the higher universe. Since the question asked was about being a witch, this reading is essentially a f\*ck yes!    

I usually consult the biddy tarot website for descriptions of card meanings. I've found it to be quite helpful. My breakdown of the individual card meanings below comes directly from their website: 

Strength: Similar to the Chariot, this card ""represents strength, determination, and power,"" however it differs from the Chariot because it usually indicates inner emotional/mental strength. This card indicates that ""you are fueled by your inner strength, personal power, strong will and determination. You do not rule by trying to control others; you quietly influence and persuade. Others may underestimate your power because it is so ‘invisible’ – but you should see that as an advantage. You can control a situation without excessive, outward force. No one knows it’s you calling the shots.""

The Hierophant: This ""card represents an established set of spiritual values and beliefs and is often correlated with religion and other formal doctrines. Before you can discover your own belief systems and make your own choices (as associated with the next card, the Lovers), the Hierophant encourages you to learn the fundamental principles from a trusted source."" Furthermore, this card ""often speaks to group membership or being part of an institution. You may enjoy a deep sense of comfort being surrounded by people who have well-established belief systems and explicit values. Finding them may be as significant as exploring a new church or religious group, or as simple as joining a gym or online Tarot community. This card is about identifying with others and a way of thinking that will prompt further learning.""

The High Priestess: This ""is the guardian of the subconscious mind and the teacher of sacred knowledge and hidden mysteries. Sitting at the threshold of the conscious and subconscious mind, the High Priestess has an innate ability to travel between these realms effortlessly. She teaches you that the world is not always as it seems and more profound influences are often at play. She ushers you through the thin veil of awareness, offering you a deep, intuitive understanding of the Universe and a heightened awareness of secret or hidden information."" ... ""Your intuitive sense right now is providing you with useful information and is assisting you to become more in touch with your subconscious mind. Knowledge of how to fix these issues will not come through thinking and rationalising, but by tapping into and trusting your intuition, so allow yourself the time and space to meditate and attend to your inner voice.""

I remember daydreaming a lot as a kid and whenever I read books it felt more like I was watching a movie, wasn't even aware of flipping pages or seeing text. But when I tried this visualization technique, I couldn't see anything just darkness. Tried it out with a few other objects (a bridge, my dog, trying to visualize the room in front of me) and it was pretty difficult. The visualization for these was more like a hazy incomplete sketch far off in the darkness, but the apple was just darkness. So I'm probably about a 1 on the scale, at least with my eyes closed. It's really strange though, because I still get lost in vivid daydreams when I'm in the middle of doing things (between 8-10 on the scale) but never feel like I have the ability to control when that happens or stop them once they start.

WritingPrompts,f0mw425,t3_d5d6ib,1568754449.0,"At first we waited together. Spending sleepless nights staring at the phone. Hope hitting us like a freight train whenever it rang. Maybe they had found her! Maybe we would hear her voice! Maybe everything would be alright... But no, the voice on the other end of the line never had any insight into what had happened, where she was, if she was okay, if she was hurt.

I only let go of her hand for a second. My husband hated me. I don't blame him, I hate myself too. I let go of her hand and now she's gone. He's gone too now. I haven't seen him in 6 years, but I heard that he got remarried and has other children of his own. I can't be happy he moved on, I don't understand how he could.

\--------------------------------------

A chorus of children's voices ring out over the playground. There's a little girl, maybe 12 years old, carefree on a swing. Pumping her legs back and forth. Giggles as sweet as honey. The sun catching and illuminating strands of her brown hair. She's about the age \_\_\_\_\_ would be, but her eyes are the wrong color and her nose the wrong shape.

A young mother sits down next to me and excitedly blurts, ""Which one is yours?"" The air turn to lead any my lungs collapse in despair. I answer the way I always have and pull out the time-worn manila envelope from my bag. Handing her one of the posters.

She falters as she sees the heading, ""MISSING"".  The information is all there and she will know who to call if she sees anything. She stutters apologies that I can't make out over the numbing buzz in my head. As she leaves, I manage to mumble, ""It only takes a second, don't ever let go..."" She walks off quickly, grabbing her son's hand before leaving the park.

\--------------------------------------

It dusk now, almost time to leave the park and head to my night shift. I hate myself for leaving the park without her, as if I thought she would be waiting for me at the swings today. Hope has left me hollow and listless.

Someone emerges from the shadowed path. A teenager, his face shrouded in his black hoody and arms stuffed in the kangaroo pocket. His shoulders are hunched forward as he shuffles closer. I can hear a soft sob break through his throat. It is wrong for someone this young to be in such obvious pain. I call out to him, asking if he would like to sit with me.

He looks up, startled. Tears leak from his dark black eyes, streaming down his gaunt face. I don't balk. I'm sure that I have given a similar expression to countless parents at the park. Instead I move over, making sure he can see that there is enough room on the bench for two. He takes a seat cautiously, chest heaving as he chokes on air. I grab my water bottle, open it, and offer it to him. After a few moments he takes a small sip.

I reach for his hand and he doesn't flinch, so I take it in my own. It's so pale and thin; I'm instantly afraid for him. Who is supposed to be taking care of him, where are they, why haven't they been feeding him enough? My mind mind suddenly clears. I murmur reassurances I used to tell my daughter. Telling him that he is safe here and asking him to breath with me. He tries to talk, but is incoherent through his sobs.  It takes a few moments for me to realize that he's sputtering out ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry"" on an unending loop.

I cradle his face in my hands, trying to see if I can get any information about what has happened to him from his eyes. I missed this, having someone to care for. His iris' are pitch black and I falter; it feels like you could get lost in those eyes... The dark is unending and something within me pitches forward into the void. But that doesn't matter now, this child needs my help. ""Honey, what are you sorry for? You have nothing to be sorry for.""

He mumbles through cracked lips, ""I... I'm not who you think I am."" His chest heaves and he looks away. ""I...I-I took her."" He gestures with his free hand towards the manila envelope on my lap. My very soul turns to ice. ""S-she wanted to see you, b-b-but I told her she had to w-wait.""

I let go of his hand. It feels like I am surrounded by a dense fog - I must have dissociated, I can see myself sitting there on the bench. A sob breaks through the boy's body again. I can hear myself say, cold and detached, ""What are you talking about?""

""Five years ago, I-I found her. She wasn't... it... it was bad there. Really bad.... She asked...she asked me if I could take her to you... but that's... it's not allowed. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.""

I looked down at my body again and the sudden realization floods through me. ""Oh.... Are you...? Am I...?""

He nods miserably still unable to look at me.

""Is she..."" I can't finish, so I start again, ""Is she safe now? Is she ok?""

But he doesn't need to answer, I can feel someones presence in the playground. As I turn to look, I hear the boy let out another sob. But she's there, at the swings, and then back in my arms again! I can breathe again. I am whole again. And I'm the one sobbing now. I turn back to the boy on the bench, my child once more on my hip.

He looks panicked, afraid of what I may say. He needn't be, I open my free arm to give him a hug. Thanking him over and over again for being there when I couldn't, for keeping her safe, for reuniting us. I take his hand again, and give him a smile, ""Where to next... son?"""

VinlandSaga,ezvo59u,t3_d2cl4v,1568187214.0,"I firmly disagree with your sentiment that Thorfinn's pacifism is undeserved. 

I think he always knew that what he was doing wasn't... ethical. Especially since some of his fathers last words were that a true warrior doesn't need a sword. His fathers words haunt him and we are shown multiple scenes where he is trying to figure out what his father meant. 

Once he is actively participating in warfare, he doesn't enjoy it. He doesn't get the same rush that the other men get from battle or exerting power over other people. While we don't see Thorfinn kill many people himself, it is heavily implied that he does rack up a large body count. You don't get good enough to bring Thorkell to his knees by only killing 10 people. 

Despite this he seems to see the bloodshed as inherently pointless and overtly brutal. However, he also believes that it only by participating in war that he can avenge his father. It's a fairly nihilistic view - there is no inherent meaning or value in life, one must create their own meaning. With this view, he distances himself from the act of killing by rationalizing that avenging his father will make everything right again. This distancing is something that all of the Vikings seem to do, however their motivation seems tied to money and going to Valhalla - which Askaladd can easily promise. 

Thorfinn believes that the only path towards avenging his father is by gaining enough fighting experience to defeat Askladd in a fair battle. We are shown time and time again that Thorfinn feels responsible for his fathers death (if only he hadn't been taken hostage). It therefore goes to show that he would feel responsible to right his wrong by avenging his fathers death. 

This objective takes over his whole life, and he stops thinking about the morality of what he is doing. We see moments when he does clearly seem concerned for others (the woman and her daughter who helped him early on). And then we also see him swallow that concern and shut down emotionally. I think he's able to do this by rationalizing that this war would be happening with or without him and he has something to gain (avenging his father) by being a part of it. Everything he does will be worth it to him, if he is the one to kill Askeladd. 

And then... he doesn't. Askeladd is killed in front of him. Suddenly, his rational for not just being with the Vikings but becoming them is impossible. Everything he did was to kill Askeladd. That was the point, and now there is no payoff for killing everyone that he did. There is no way to atone for his father, no way to atone for the people he killed, and no way to atone for families he broke apart. He suddenly realizes that he killed so many people ... for *nothing*. He can no longer run from the ethics of his situation. 

There is also the possibility that he felt grief over Askeladd's death (he had become a mentor in someways and a bastardized father figure for Thorfinn). If this were the case, Thorfinns would also have to face that fact as well  - which would be pretty complicated and confusing to try and sort out on your own. Perhaps he would arrive at the opposite conclusion that he had as a child; all life, even the life of the one who killed his father, has inherent value. If he was able to feel grief over Askeladd, this monster, I think it would make sense that he expand this humanization to all the regular soldiers/peasants that he killed over the years. 

He realizes that he had become who he despised and hated as a child, someone who killed indiscriminately and without regard. There was no glory, no point, no way to rationalize what he had done, only so much death and so much pain. And this causes a sudden change in his behavior and appearance, because all of his walls have come down. At first he lashes out and then just completely shuts down for years. 

We always see Thorfinn moving as child; yet it the farm arc he is stuck in one location only moving when there is work to do and waiting for commands of where to go. He can't block out the emotional turmoil and (apart from work) shuts down physically. He has no motivation to go anywhere. His pacifism seems more robotic and dazed, almost born of out of a depressed apathy than from an actual choice. There are no longer any illusions, just death and dealing with the aftermath. And he is never allowed to forget this in the later chapters - either through night terrors or by having a crossbow aimed at his face by the daughter of someone he killed.  

When he gains his first friend, he realizes that others are able to find or create meaning in life (his friends crush). After years of not caring if he lives or dies, his body demonstrates that he still has a will to live. The following chapters details the baby steps he takes to find a new objective which will benefit the people around him. He is amazed by the work of farmers who nurture life and help provide food for their communities. We see him struggle to create a working philosophy and then struggle more in trying to hold to it when surrounding by warmongers. 

I'm excited to see how the adult Thorfinn will continue to transform and develop over time. Especially as he continues to gain friends and people who are willing to truly support him. 

\-I'll agree that I find the prologue more rich in ways to analyze the characters - however, I feel that way because adult Thorfinns story is still being written. I'm excited to watch this develop and I think it took balls for the author to create a Viking manga where the main character renounces violence. I'm willing to wait for more chapters to see how this plays out and I am optimistic that the story will continue to be written in equal caliber to the prologue."
VinlandSaga,ezkz3ut,t3_d11kjg,1567969013.0,"This post has some spoilers for the manga (and therefor anime) - **read at your own risk**.

Very cool video and analysis! What I love about the manga is how fluid both Canute and Thorfinn's transformations are. Their beliefs and the development of their beliefs seems very natural. I think one thing you could have added is how both Canute and Thorfinn seem to reject their father's philosophy as children but learn to embrace facets of their father's philosophy as adults.

I think it could have been cool to have a longer discussion on how Thorfinn and Canute are impacted by Thors and Sweyn over time (especially when they are out of the picture). Or how both had mentors which operated under different philosophies than their fathers (Askeladd and Ragnar) and the changes they experience when their mentors are gone. I think that would add how the conflict that Thorfinn and Canute have with each other and within themselves mirrors a greater generational philosophical struggle.

I think too, it would have been cool to get into how Thorfinn and Canute address being in positions of power. Young Canute at first rejects the power he was born into and then harnesses it and strives to have more (which you do talk about). While Thorfinn seeks power as a child, but as an adult goes as far to reject a seat of power *after* officially dismantling a powerful force of arms. What I find really interesting is that Thorfinn and Canute are both trying to get to the same place - peace. Something that everyone around them seems to either think is impossible or a disastrous idea.

Anyways, Thorfinn and Canute are perfect foils of each other. Major props to the author for creating such a rich story.

Thanks again for this analysis, it really made me think :)"
overcoming,ez7wyno,t3_d032m2,1567729564.0,"Hi, I'm going to be honest - I'm not too sure about what I'm talking about. I'm not a professional and haven't been married (I'm 23). 

However, I am from the midwest (Illinois) and come from a religious family (went to 3 church services a week and participated in a living nativity for over 10 years). I grew up in a non-denominational church and have personal experience with anti-LGBTQ+ attitudes coming from the church. 

I want to be as upfront and honest as possible, so I'll let you know that I realized that the church (or at least mine) was not a safe environment for me to be in. I lost my faith in highschool and still have an adverse reaction to thinking about participating in organized religion. However, I do know people who transitioned, retained/were strengthened by their faith, and found their place in the Church. I know that they had a difficult time being accepted and loved by their family members, but these are the times we live in. 

I don't have many answers for the questions that you posed. But I would recommend that you start seeing a therapist as well. You will not be able to control how your family reacts to this situation, and some may say some really hurtful things... For that, I'm sorry. A therapist can help you feel stabilized before having these conversations. Also it sounds like you have a lot on your mind and a therapist can be helpful in identifying 

I would also recommend that your partner sees a therapist soon as well. idk what you're schedule looks like, but it may be helpful for him to feel like there is more time if you offer to cook dinner or walk the dog on days when he has therapy. Also it sounds like his company is very supportive of planning the schedule around therapy. It may be helpful to have a calm and compassionate conversation with your partner about how their work has been impactful on the company - but in order to continue doing great work, they also need to make sure that they are in a good place. 

It may even be good to try couples counseling. My understanding is that you will be facing this transition together. It would be good to feel like you are on the same page and I think going to a therapist who knows both of you would help them better understand how you are both looking at the situation. I would make sure that the therapist is LBTQ+ friendly - there a still some out there who will try and ""fix"" being transgender which can be extremely damaging. 

Finally, it might be helpful to hear Dr. H Adam Ackely's testimony on being trans and religious. He is an ordained minister. I've included a link to one of his presentations that he gave at All Saints Church: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybffUHxSKI4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybffUHxSKI4) 

I'm sorry that I can't account for the specific things you may face from the Catholic Church and Catholic perspective - I'm just ignorant and don't really know much about that perspective. However, I hope some of what I wrote can be helpful. 

You and your husband are not alone and I'm rooting for you!"

depression,ez3dxuq,t3_cztpg3,1567665621.0,"First off, a counselor is supposed to meet you where you are and then act as guide. My advice, look for and schedule a meeting with a new counselor/therapist, then drop this one.   Therapists are people and sometimes its just not a good fit. You should feel proud of yourself for going to therapy. For taking these steps. For getting the ball rolling. No one should take that feeling away! Especially not your therapist!

As to your actual question:

Honestly, it took me a long time to *want* to be better... and it's not a feeling that you have once and then it's permanently there (at least not for me). Also, *better* is relative to where you currently are.

For me, this feeling began as wanting to be better for other people (in essence, better was a performance for others rather than something I truly wanted for myself). At that time, better meant staying alive. I didn't want to live and I actively wanted to die, but I didn't want my parents and siblings to have to deal with that. So *better* = living long enough to outlive my parents and then give in to suicidal ideation (not something any therapist would be thrilled to hear). I put my own opinions on the living-matter (i.e. all of my opinions) last,  put my parents first and everyone else second. This mindset bit me in the ass later, but l was around to experience a later - so whatever.

After a traumatic experience in my first few months of college, I realized that putting everyone else before myself was not the best survival technique. *Better* became trying to balance my own opinions with others. *Better* also regressed to not giving into constant suicidal ideation - however I bartered with this and began smoking as a way to shorten my life span. So, not great... actually pretty bad. But still, *better* than rotting in the ground. I also reached out to therapists/counselors during this time.

About 3 and half years after aforementioned traumatic experience, I began to realize that I could start actively working on mental health issues I had previous to that experience. *Better* became transforming my idea of success (success = being able to prioritize my mental health). *Better* became feeling like I wanted to get better not for my parents/family/friends but for myself - which is what I think most therapists want to hear. *Better* became being at peace with living and actively seeking to do things that I might enjoy. *Better* became being able to plan for the future. *Better* became vaping rather than smoking.

I'm still figuring out what *better* means for me. I still grapple with depression and suicidal ideation, but I have gained so many tools in the last 12 years to help me with the struggle. I still fall and its hard to get back up, sometimes I stay down for awhile. Sometimes doing better is forcing myself to eat a small bag a chips over a few hours so that I can say I ate that day. Even now, sometimes it feels like I'm just going through the motions. But that helps keep my head above water and gives me a better chance at fighting through it.

There have been many times when I'm not motivated enough to fight as hard as I know I can / have in the past. It's hard to know if this is a lack of motivation or discipline or just a side-effect of the depression. And that's extremely frustrating. But, things are constantly in a state of change. I've been through enough depressive episodes to know that things can be better. That even if I'm not seeing the rewards of my work, it is still productive to keep trucking along.

I guess, better can be as simple as saying that there can be a better and then reaching out towards it."
Dreams,ez354kb,t3_czvs0t,1567661074.0,"I love dreams within dreams! Sometimes dream me doesn't need to go to sleep, as long as I  keep track of portals/doorways. My favorite was when I descended through 5 ""levels"" and had to revisit those levels in order to wake up. Each dream level had a different objective that I had to do. I wasn't lucid during this dream - don't really know how I didn't realize though. The deepest phase of this dream included me stealing information from the ruins of a Coruscant library while being chased by Santa - whose sleigh was being pulled by six cartoon mechanical hippos. And I was like, yep this seems normal lol."
Dreams,ez2zgx5,t3_czw61y,1567659699.0,"I haven't used apps or even a smartphone in my dreams (that I can remember), but I have always been able to read in dreams.

Sometimes the subject matter is similar - like one time I was looking at a gif of someone surfing, looked away and then back only to see a different person surfing a different wave. Funny thing about this gif was that it was on a tablet, like an ancient stone tablet."
overcoming,ez15pua,t3_czlgwq,1567645280.0,"A little over a year ago I was in a Gestalt Therapy group workshop. It was an interesting experience where for 3 hours a day our group was instructed to be fully in the present and use ""I statements"". Even though we were concentrating on the present, we were asked to analyze how we reacted to others in the group in terms of what past experiences we were projecting on to them. 

By doing so, we learned how to better separate our projections from the actual situation and person. 

It sounds like you are acknowledging that you may be projecting your experiences with your abusive family member onto other people in your life. This is a defensive mechanism  that is meant to keep you safe but it sounds like it is working on overdrive right now. 

I would recommend working on recognizing when you are projecting the past onto the present. It may also be helpful to list the positive qualities of your friends and chosen family which are different than the abusers - which may help your anxiety recognize that these are actually different situations and that it isn't needed to keep you safe in this moment. 

Building trust back up when it has been pulverized by someone close to you is really hard and takes time. It sounds like your chosen family and friends may already be aware that you are struggling with this. But is also sounds like they are willing to help you on this journey. 

It may be helpful to see a therapist (if you aren't already) and talk about these issues with them as well. They may be able to provide advice in how to better move forward. 

All the best!"
depression,ez100fs,t1_eyk5e6g,1567644056.0,"My sister told me something similar. She asked me how I would feel and react if I saw someone polluting a river. (I've been told I'm a bit of hippy and I'm into nature and shit - so my sister knew that I would have a visceral reaction to that question). And I responded that I would be angry and try and do my best to stop them. 

She then said that *I* was the river. It's weird, but projecting the emotions that I had towards nature onto myself has been a bit helpful. Since then, I've been trying to stop polluting myself with negative thought spirals and substances - as well as take a stand when other people try and dump their metaphorical shit on me."
