Trying to explain to my SO the feelings and encompassing exhaustion and mental fog that comes with it, is impossible. 

The thing that makes me so nauseous is that for some reason when I am maybe an hour or so into the migraine, my head fills with thoughts. Random thoughts. Sometimes it’s two lines of a song playing over and over again. Or it’s like a mind dump of randomness that swirls around and around and makes me dizzy. 

Either way. Worst pain ever. There is never enough excedrin to help.

Edit: I seriously thought I was the only person who had those “exhausting song lyric thoughts”

If you are in a “right to work” state and not unionized you can be terminated at any moment for any reason. Most jobs I’ve had in NY that didn’t have a union have a clause that you sign that says the employee or employer can separate employment at any time without notice or some BS like that."

FitZAll podcast is three tool guys bs-ing about tools, machines and general silliness. However, if you don’t really keep up with their Instagram stuff, you might feel left out.

Along that same line is Making It. Three YouTube makers (build stuff and make tutorial videos on YouTube) chat with each other.
