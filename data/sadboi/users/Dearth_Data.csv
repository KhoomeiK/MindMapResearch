You're in denial pal with a master's. Was it in a pharmacy or biochemical field you have that master's in? You don't need sourcing to know it. You want validation. Heavy use correlates with depression. Pretty much every study I've read that investigates heavy use finds this. While I'm inclined to interpret the famous PLoS one study on pot and bipolar as indica/sativa dependent, the bifurcated affect effect (I loved saying that) could just as readily be frequency/intensity dependent. A blunt a night won't have the same effect as a joint every other weekend plain and simple.

Here are more sources for you to find your way out of that river in Egypt. Light use can be good for depression if you ask PLoS One.

This isn't the first time you've been in denial and this likely won't be the last, but believe it when I say, even from personal experience, that while use can alleviate depression, heavy use is consistently found to correlate with increased levels of depression.

The longer your meal's glycemic index, (~~lower numbers~~ actually I think higher) or more balanced it is (kashi used to have these golean bars that had both high and low indices combined) the more stable your energy supply, which helps flatten blips in your mood.

Exceptions could apply of course, but I haven't heard of any. It upregulates serotonin dopamine norepinephrine and I think others through reuptake inhibition. Combining it with an SSRI, 5ht/5htp (same chemical different label) (which on its own can risk mania or serotonin syndrome), or tryptophan can risk mania or serotonin syndrome. Just think of it as a poorly regulated ssri that works on other neurotransmitters as well. When your dosing is poorly monitored or excessive that's when serotonin syndrome is the biggest risk. I've read it in prescribing guidelines, I've read about the pharmacology on wikipedia and probably in a textbook or two, and its being so poorly controlled can result in uneven dosing and stuff. Idk, just be cautious with it I guess. It's not like microdosing will cause serotonin syndrome on its own, but it interacts with other meds so you want to tell your psychiatrist that you're taking it so they can alert you of your risks. Your pharmacist too.

I'm researching this in ebscohost and I read dopaminergics on a short term basis can be highly effective for bp. The study didn't find evidence of manic switches. Since amphetamines (source is somewhere in *Bipolar Disorders*) are used to model mania in animals, you shouldn't require another source to indicate it risks manic episodes.

I want more of us able to take them at a doctor's rx. With an antimanic agent. It just felt like you were advocating something unsafe for us without the context of how misleading it might be construed for if you've already got the diagnosis nor the context of how to keep it from resulting in hearing voices 24/7, inpatient episodes, behavior so shameful you lose whole friend groups over it, losing most of your money and your job, and if you're really fucked maybe even your dog. You haven't validated how dangerous mania can be for so many of us. Even if you haven't experienced mania before, stimulants can induce full mania and switch us from hypomanic type 2 to manic type 2.

I hope you get your uppers and they're safe by you. I hope no one who reads this goes on uppers without a chemical safety net, as it seemed your wording risked."

It's cool. It says what it says and has credibility. It doesn't have cause for changing adult treatment paradigms nor suspension of first line psychiatric advice.

Share away and let people know depressive episodes are less likely for those treated for ADHD in adolescence, but remember this didn't measure the likelihood to experience manic episodes nor the expected severity of developed bipolar disorder (the greater the %diagnosed type 2, the less mania and therefore more reason for optimism).

In fact I'd probably encourage it for ADHD+BP. But no way in hell without some strong antimanic presence. You want only lamictal to be your antimanic regimen? How about some ritalin or weaker? My point is it can be super risky. I want yours treated but I don't think you should tell a subreddit dedicated to a disorder contraindicating the advocated medication that it prevents their illness when for some it can induce it.

I'll go get the primary source."

4. most importantly, amphetamines and other stimulants induce mania. Maybe you don't get diagnosed bipolar, but one man's mania could look like someone else's poorly managed ADHD.
5. Seriously, most treatments for ADHD are contraindicated for bipolar until you get to like 5th lines of treatment (ect is third line, so after that) because of their risk of mania. Also: then only in the presence of a strong anti manic agent. It might pass muster to do it with just lamictal, but it's got some of the weaker anti-manic efficacy profiles out there)

Seriously guys. Super robust evidence here, taking amphetamines can induce mania, and dextroamphetamine is how they model mania in animals.

Edit: sorry for taking the flippant tone of a dick to what came off as a dangerously bad idea now turned...well...noteworthy and no longer sounding dangerous. It's a cool article worth going to sci-hub to read and the sampling breakdown seemed questionable and its results need validation by another means that might accommodate for SES as a confounding variable between medication receiving and not (seriously a strong correlate of poor mental health is low SES, even if I've read it doesn't hold true for those diagnosed schizophrenic (don't know where)). Yup, getting help reduces your likelihood of developing a major depressive episode is clear from the research. Not clear: change to likelihood of manic symptoms (sometimes slides under the radar for bipolar dx)."

TL;DR:

Serotonin syndrome. That is all.

Watch for it, talk to your pdoc and pharmacist, worry if your doses get high, and remember the serotonin synthesis aspect of lithium isn't exactly the most studied part of the med. It actually is a concern even at low doses, but it's not guaranteed to happen and there's a dose effect more for the ssri than the lithium. Your doctor's advice should serotonin syndrome arise will likely be ""Come see me and stop taking the offending medication(s)"""

It appears to increase the efficacy of the fluvoxamine. Look up serotonin syndrome and if you experience symptoms of it, contact your doctor immediately. It's what happens when you overdose on mdma btw.

One of the articles alleges lithium promotes serotonin synthesis, so with more serotonin, your levels could go high enough to risk serotonin syndrome, which is unpleasant as hell.  


If your ssri is low it's fine. It's possible he knows and thinks the synergy might make it better. If he didn't know they interact then if you have great insurance looking for a new doc might not hurt.

the tarascon pocket pharmacopoeia 2020 tells us ssris can lower sodium levels (and therefore decrease lithium clearing to raise levels) and lists meds not to combine with luvox, but lithium wasn't one of them. I'd be more worried if your doc had you on two ssris without an intent to cross titrate you between them.

TL;DR: drink more water, eat more salt (both lower lithium levels so don't do this if your blood levels are significantly low), monitor for serotonin syndrome, and you're in the clear. You likely already were. It's the pharmacist giving you the warning labels I'd look to replace if I was you. Or talk to them and ask why because they know more shit than I do even if I think they're unnecessarily fearmongering."

I've read regimens that treat oxidative stress from mania, but honestly if you want to reverse it meds and exercise are likely your best bets. Lithium and some mood stabilizers might improve brain function and theoretically reverse some deficits (but not necessarily the damage). Exercise is great for brain health too. Whatever supplements I could recommend, there's reason to believe the best thing for you is to stay away from drugs and take your meds. Also, while I've read a slew of research about brain abnormalities from pot in teenage years, none I've read described them as damage. Yup, you got a mood disorder out of it. Sometimes they enter remission when you take super good care of yourself (I don't know if I've ever read of permanent remission, but 95% of your life is something I'd buy given enough self improvement).
