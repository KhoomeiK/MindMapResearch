CPTSD,fqtsgg3,t3_gjitfh,1589645218.0,"I feel very much let down by the mental health services of my country. Lately I've gotten worse and worse and my therapist wanted to quit because she thought she didn't have enough experience to help me. She referred me out to the public mental health services which are crap and they offer only medication and biweekly psych nurse's appointments that make me worse.

My assigned psych nurse belittles my trauma, understands me wrong all the time and doesn't believe anything I say. Every complaint I have of my treatment must be wrong and every side effect of my medication must be imagined because I'm a *crazy* mental health patient. I cried one session and she just sat there looking annoyed and waited for me to stop. I'm so hypervigilant and suicidal after every appointment and it got to the point that I told her that I want to switch nurses.

I'm also an aspie and they referred me to an Asperger's coaching programme which lasts till like September. We don't talk about mental health issues there at all because we focus on the Asperger's related problems. Turns out they have decided that they will put all the mental health appointments on hold till the coaching is over and they'll decide what they're gonna do with my request in September.

My trauma symptoms are getting worse and I get more severe symptoms and repressed memories all the time. I don't have the tools for self-help  because I've never had these symptoms before. I know the grounding techiques for hypoarousal and flashbacks but that's about it. I don't know what I should do with the repressed feelings and new insights on my own. I also age regress from time to time, I suck my thumb and act like a little child. It is involuntary, scary and weird.

I think I need some kind of help before autumn and I keep seeing advice that you should contact the mental health services and explain it but I don't think they care in my town. The public mental health center is overfilled and they like to wash their hands of cases like mine. They just tell you to go to the emergency room if you're feeling suicidal but that's about it.

I don't know if I should contact my therapist or if it will do more harm because she's not trauma informed, didn't recognize hypoarousal and she told me herself that she doesn't know anything about stabilizing. It's also possible to get talk appointments from a local mental health association but they aren't professionals and I don't know if they'll say my symptoms are too weird or severe."

Sometimes when you have a lot of baggage in the past, it can interfere with how you see the present though. I know I sometimes get irrational, strong feelings that seem over the top considering what has actually happened but I'm actually feeling the same thing I felt in the past. The brain remembers the feeling even though the conscious mind doesn't, it sees that the situation vaguely reminds of a similar thing in the past and you get the strong, irrational emotions.

OCD,fjdhim1,t1_fjd1py9,1583252843.0,"Glad to hear it's gone away man, OCD can  be such a scary disease sometimes. I already know I have issues with hypervigilance, didn't know it was linked to these kind of symptoms."
aspergers,fjdh9w1,t1_fjcuvvg,1583252729.0,Yeah. It's harder when you have trouble reading that validation and acceptance from other people's face.
OCD,fjcsrkv,t3_epdoid,1583235214.0,Has this improved? Did you talk to your doctor? I've been having the exact same symptoms and I'm scared and depressed about it. üòî Psychosis is my worst fear.
aspergers,fjcf2v9,t3_fcnkhi,1583217667.0,Thank you for this. I've plummeted into deep depression after my diagnosis because I now have proof that people really don't like me after all and I was right. I have social anxiety and therapy focuses on questioning my thought distortions. The diagnosis doesn't necessarily mean that every time I've thought I was awkward and that people hate me was really true. Apparently I was well liked at my previous workplace where I always had social anxiety and thought everyone disliked me.
psytrance,fjagx98,t1_fja1an5,1583173266.0,That psy-like rolling bass and subtle psytrance influences are super popular with EDM producers right now. It is kind of annoying but I can't explain why

memes,fj6rt5j,t1_fj6az7o,1583078772.0,"I don't know how to discuss without responding with an anecdote of the most similar experience I have. I see everyone doing it though and thought it's just the way people talk to show they relate, but apparently I'm wrong?"
1200isfineIGUESSugh,fj6qggu,t1_fj6lx2d,1583077938.0,I see those eating disordered types a lot in r/1200isjerky. Someone there was raging that her doctor screamed at her that she will die when she did 1200 so no one should ever eat that way. They have somehow trouble seeing that they are not obese petite women.
