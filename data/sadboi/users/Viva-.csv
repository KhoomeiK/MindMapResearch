BPD,fibt5lx,t3_f75f8o,1582329519.0,Hope this doesn't sound too corny  or I sound like I'mimposong- I'm not black but Latino and have BPD (diagnosed 4yrs ago) I totally understand family just saying to pray it away or get a job and stay focused. I don't wanna join any group chat don't worry but I wanted to say your fellow poc see you. Much love to you all. ‚ù§üíñ
BPD,fdsug3v,t3_emyry4,1578708085.0,I'm so proud of you for choosing life. Really glad you're still here. Not to make this about myself but my survival date just passed (Jan 7th) and I'm so glad I'm still here. Life has genuinely improved so much so I hope the same same for you. One moment at time. ‚ù§
