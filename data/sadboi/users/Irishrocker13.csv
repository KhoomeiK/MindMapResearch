Hydrocephalus,fhjrpin,t3_f3lmgk,1581653706.0,"There are a ton of FB groups most of them are made up of parents with young kids with hydrocephalus( with a few adult members as well) Iâ€™ve found this group to be really helpful. 

The one thing to keep in mind is that everyone one has different experiences with hydrocephalus. So you can learn and grow from any group.

For instance , Iâ€™m not really limited at all with what I canâ€™t do ( minus crazy roller coasters) . So seeing everyone elseâ€™s experiences with this sheds a whole new light on the condition for me. It also makes me really great full to interact and learn from everyone"
insomnia,ffz468q,t1_ffz3zhr,1580363375.0,Thanks for the tips! I really just need to breath and just take it a step at a time. I lost my grandpa 2 weeks ago so itâ€™s been a little tough getting back to reality and just two days ago my car broke down and Iâ€™ve been bumming rides to get to work.  So the whole car thing is literally the thing keeping me up since I donâ€™t want to burden anyone. :/ Iâ€™ve got a book laying around somewhere. I may have to try that out :)
insomnia,fel8wu0,t1_fej5uen,1579216619.0,"Thanks for the pointers. I tend to normally do that to be honest , but this was a totally different feeling with the insomnia. You may see it in an earlier reply but the service was amazing and a lot of people gave my grandfather so much praise . It really made me proud  to be his grandson and helped put my mind at ease ."
insomnia,fel8oxk,t3_epfk76,1579216478.0,Thatâ€™s really a great way of thinking about it. I think with me it was just the weight of the upcoming funeral that gave me little to no sleep.  Iâ€™ll be honest it was an amazing funeral and a lot of people spoke incredibly high of my grandfather. So now knowing all those kind words and seeing how much he meant to everyone else will help put my mind at ease and allow me to sleep

Iâ€™ve felt the same way about wasting my 20â€™s and here I am at 30 still not sure what Iâ€™m doing.

All I can say is keep youâ€™re head up man. Youâ€™ve got things going for you and I bet your family is really proud of all that youâ€™ve accomplished so far. Youâ€™ll meet some one trust me. I believe that everything happens for a reason and people come on out of your life for a reason as well. Stay true to who you are and those people that are meant to cross your path will.
