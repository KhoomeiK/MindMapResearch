And not only have you lost your partner but I presume you haven‚Äôt been able to mourn in the ways our society normally does ( service, funeral, etc). This is on top of the grief our whole world is trying to come to grips with right now-life as we have known it irrevocably changed.

Check out co-dependency. Melody Beattie is a good author. I bet you see yourself in some of it. 

Sadly while the individuals vary greatly in many respects, alcoholics/addicts share many of the same characteristics. It is generally accepted as a disease of the brain that needs treatment and has a certain set of identifiable symptoms. Often times those are well hidden though. We can all relate to each other on some level( once we accept the fact). We also truly lose control over our behavior at some point.

CommercialRealEstate,fmdrfbs,t3_fug9sf,1585975652.0,"A national company like Goodyear ( or savvy tenants) often retain a large group like CBRE to manage their leases or handle complex issues. This qualifies. 

I am a commercial property manager and got an almost identical letter for two of my office tenants today from CBRE. I bet many others did too. 
I am also getting this request in various formats from the small mom and pop to the large big boxes. 

Some may have the ability to pay and some may not. Is it a franchise? They might qualify for the SBA funds. Are they guaranteed by corporate? 
If it is corporate chances are better it is just a tactic and you can be a bit more firm.  But even corporations work on budgets and without revenue they are screwed too. 

Scrub your lease for anything that helps you. Refer them to their insurance company to review their policy- just in case. 

You don‚Äôt have to say yes but it‚Äôs a good idea to be open to working with them. If you default them for non payment and they end up leaving, your out of pocket is only going to sky rocket and no revenue coming in for months, potentially years depending on how this crisis plays out. 

At the minimum they need to pay the net charges. Ask for financials, particularly sales and monthly income statements, to prove hardship. It is essentially a new lease negotiation so get a broker to help if you can. 

Good luck."

CommercialRealEstate,fm6sce9,t1_fm6ir4o,1585801884.0,"I‚Äôve been a commercial property manager for a very long time. NNN is never a profit center. It is simply a reimbursement to the LL for the actual expenses of running the building. The Lease should detail what these include/exclude but most notably taxes, insurance and general repair and maintenance items. The expenses are estimated at the beginning of the year (often treated like an escrow so the LL has some funds to pay the expenses during the year). That estimate is based off the budget and then reconciled after that year is closed out. You may owe, you may get a credit. Some LL will review mid year as well. 

The only exception would be the management fee which is usually a standard percentage of revenue. That‚Äôs the LL profit and should be a clear line item. Ask for the breakdown. The percentage might vary in your state but usually 4‚Äì6% of gross revenue. 
I agree using a broker to rep your negotiation. You are an expert at whatever it is you do, not Lease negotiations. A reputable and responsible LL is more interested in getting a tenant that will fulfill the Lease terms and be a good tenant than trying to screw them over. 
 If the NNN were a fixed amount it would either be called a flat fee or similar or factored into the base rent and you would then be in a gross lease. 

The cost of running a building increases just like everything else -taxes go up, utilities go up, wear and tear on improvements, landscaping contractors charge more. Those costs have to be absorbed they NNN so that is why increases are normal. 

Hope this helps."

addiction,fgnfb3e,t3_ezbz80,1580943642.0,"It‚Äôs hard. There is no doubt. But it IS worth it. And you have the opportunity  many of us didn‚Äôt. You‚Äôre still young physically and your body/brain has a better chance at healing and re-wiring. 
It sounds as if you still can choose sobriety. Relapsing is part of recovery but it is not a requirement of recovery. 

Just hold on. And walk the situation out to the inevitable conclusion-that helps too."

My humble suggestion is adding a filter to sort by language. Somedays I just don't want to deal with subtitles, other days I feel a little more highbrow."

PropertyManagement,fg2qmlp,t3_ewilxx,1580452054.0,"Presumably you have a team -that‚Äôs a pretty large portfolio. I was feeling maxed at 1.3 mil sf -26 properties- 250 tenants. 
If not, hire someone!  Use an online work order system to get mtnce emails out of your inbox. Figure out what kind of emails you get the most and figure out how else to re-route them or pre-empt them. 
Use automatic messages and templates in your email. 
Good luck!"
Landlord,ffpyxkv,t3_euk8h2,1580111569.0,Your new agreement nullifies this clause -they are not breaching the contract. You agreed to terminate early.

addiction,ffkodgx,t3_eu0fsl,1580026095.0,"Yes. 
Ultimately, recovery is only truly possible if you are doing it for yourself. Not because the courts told you or the wife is going to leave you or you got fired (I understand this is what you mean by outside pressure). 
It requires looking honestly at your life and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm done living like this. I deserve better‚Äù
No one knew I had an opiate problem (sober 12 years). I just couldn‚Äôt live with my life anymore. 

If you mean without any support to recover, 100% without treatments, medications, meetings, whatever? It‚Äôs possible I suppose. But having some connection with someone who gets it, whatever form that takes, increases recovery greatly."
ADHD,ffhk35p,t3_etkdzt,1579938900.0,Well said!
Landlord,ffenezz,t3_et5t4y,1579855803.0,"Don‚Äôt let all the background noise of he said/she said overwhelm you. Those things don‚Äôt really matter. Stick to the facts. Presumably you have a lease and there should be items you can clearly and legally point to, in order to start the default process. If you don‚Äôt have a lease that should simplify it as it defaults to month to month and you just need to give her the proper notice to vacate for your state. 
Google your state and landlord/tenant laws. There are sure to be plenty of resources, more than just one fee- based association. 
And document everything-photos and type up conversations as you have them. 
Good luck"
