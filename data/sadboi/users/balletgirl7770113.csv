My daughter wasn't/isn't a nudist, but because it was only the two of us, I didn't make a fuss over what she did or didn't wear. The majority of the time she would wear either underwear or underwear and a cami or t-shirt. However, if company was present, she had to cover up more, usually adding a pair of shorts.

I am thinking a compromise might be a good idea, especially as she starts developing and mixed company of different ages are present. 

You can let her know you support her being a nudist. Maybe allow nudity in her bedroom and provide a cover-up or robe of some kind to wear if company is present. Unless someone is living in a nudist colony with nudist friends, it's fairly customary even for nudists to cover themselves in the presence of company. She is eleven. She has MANY years to live a nudist lifestyle. A relative of mine who is a nudist said the majority of adolescents cover up, especially if not in a colony setting and the people aren't nudists. Check the laws in your state.

What do you want the rules to look like when she is 12? 14? 16? 18, graduated and in uni or working? Ideally, you would have started with these rules.

You can explain you are feeling this out and learning as you go, and the pandemic with its issues were not anything you anticipated happening. 


Talk to her. Enlist her help and input when figuring this out. Compromise. Set rules and maybe even time intervals to evaluate what you both learn and make any necessary changes.

This sounds like your problem. You gave them the choice knowing how you felt. They like the school and don't want to change schools. As a teacher you should be aware of the socialization and educational issues that come with changing schools (AGAIN).

You seem to be struggling with boundaries. You want to change the boundaries you put in place, but have you set boundaries with your co-workers and students?

You seem to be inconsistent in what you say about your school. Each school has its positives and negatives. So, let me guess, your school has higher test scores? That is beneficial to your children. They have accessibility to more extracurriculars should they want them and don't express the desire to change schools for smaller class sizes and obscure subjects.

This CAN work. It's natural to try to convince people of your side, but it comes off as excuses and self justification. How did they end up at your school? Did you present it as a choice? Did they want to go to your school?

Back to pregnancy fears, did she want you to have a vasectomy or use a condom? Maybe she feels like you didn't hear her needs and feels the responsibility was placed on her shoulders.

I am trying to be supportive. That said, I brought up a fact I know from experience. Some of the porn that exists as ""rape fantasy"" show an actual rape. A guy married to a cousin of mine brought me into his computer room where he showed me pictures of myself being raped. They were circulated on the internet.

I do NOT blame you. I think it's terrible you were raped. Even if your body had responded (they can do that), it wouldn't mean you wanted to be raped.

I just cannot help but worry about the wo/men who consume this ""fantasy rape"" from the perspective of getting off on violating someone, as in the attacker's perspective. A former partner used to tell me every woman secretly wants to be raped, and when I'd tell him to stop he told me knew I liked it because my body responded. So, he didn't stop; it got very violent. Then he'd manipulate and gaslight me. I blamed myself.

I apologize if I caused you pain. That was NOT my intention. We are here to support each other in healing. I see your perspective, and I hope you can see mine a little bit better.

Do you think she has a possible eating disorder? Eating 5 ice cream sandwiches (approximately 900 calories) that weren't hers and then lying about it sounds like ED behaviors. 

I realize there are other possibilities, but:

1) You say she brought up that you would think it's her because she's fat. Has her weight and intake been a household issue? Food goes missing that she denies taking? 

2) They said they would punish her if you had proof. So, they expected her to be ""caught"" in the action? Sounds to me like she is being sneaky with food.

3) Their protectiveness of someone who is stealing food sounds codependent. Frequently people with EDs are surrounded by enablers.

Over how many days did she consume the 5 ice cream sandwiches and the 9(?)? That's A LOT of ice cream sandwiches! 

3) Filming someone unexpectedly is assholish. No one likes the idea of being secretly filmed. 

That said, you filmed the fridge. I might get upset if someone filmed me without permission, but she was NOT Miss Innocence here. You got the proof she was stealing and lying about it. Then she was behaving manipulatively and gaslighting your ""suspicions"".

The key here is consent. He didn't know this. You weren't in a consensual non-consent BDSM situation. He saw a sleeping, drunk, unconscious girl and raped her...you.

Notice the differences. Consensual non-consent, like all proper BDSM, is pre-arranged. You know the person, their STI status, and are prepared on some level. I have no background with this, only education. Anyhow, YOU would choose condom or no condom. You would be on BC. YOU choose the partner or situation. YOU may/would arrange a scenario. (HE) knows you have consented to the encounter and both should have received proper training and had experience in the BDSM community. There should be a contract. Even that can go terribly wrong. It CAN go too far. (Women) have suffered permanent injury, PTSD, even death.

Fantasies and ""fetishes"", using the term more colloquially, aren't inherently good or bad. They just are and could/should be safely explored.

I am having trouble understanding the problem. You can perform a search for easy, healthy meals. You can read. You can follow directions. That is cooking in a nutshell.

Look up a You Tube video.

You quite literally have all day to work out how to make a simple meal.

May I ask why you brought up virginity in the first place? This isn't an attack on that at all. There are possible clues in his reply.

Do religious beliefs come into your or his beliefs?

OP there are a couple of ways to look at virginity.
1) If the hymen isn't ""intact"" and the woman doesn't bleed (on her wedding night), then they aren't a virgin. This is not true. Some women are born without hymens. Injuries can disrupt the hymen. Care can be taken to lessen/prevent bleeding.

2) Virginity is about first sexual experience. It's their ""sexual debut"" when they first CHOOSE to have a sexual experience.

There are several variations on these two schools of thought.

The whole idea of virginity is kind of outdated. For instance, are ppl who only have oral or anal sex virgins? When does a lesbian lose their virginity? Why is virginity considered taken or lost in women?

It seems strange to me that your husband (""took"") the virginity of numerous partners.

Did he know you had been raped before you married?

My ex husband also said cruel (and strange) things about virginity, especially mine. 

It should be interesting for you to note that people would have differing opinions on when you ""lost your virginity"". When do YOU feel you ""lost your virginity""? Why is this so important NOW? To either of you?

Do you fear/think virginity and your husband's perception of when you lost it affects his desire for sex now? Do you feel/think/know he (or you) consider(s) yourself damaged goods and this affects your sexual relationship now? How did your trauma impact your (sexual) relationship? Do you KNOW why he has LD? Doesn't want sex?

All that said, please allow me to go back to the TL;DR: Time to end this marriage. I don't think he can unring that bell. Now you have the choice, the power (it's okay to do it with help) to not buy into the baggage that comes with his cruelty.

I try not to use the words brutal or violent when describing what happened to me, and I was told by medical personnel, police, and trauma therapists that I was minimizing what had been terribly violent, brutal rape(s). 

I was hospitalized for 5 days after one of them. Also, I have a congenital anomaly that, among other things, gave me a very small vaginal opening. I was punch-fisted in a separate rape. I passed out and bled everywhere. I required medical attention. The SANE had to leave to pull herself together. She said the only thing worse she'd seen was the aftermath of a 3y/o girl's rape.

Her period COULD be late due to the stress of being raped. Is her period usually regular? Is she on BC? Many women are on BC for menstrual issues. My daughter went on BC at age 12! Do you know her views on abortion? If she is pro choice, even if she isn't, the sooner she takes a test the better. Either she will learn she isn't pregnant and can put that fear behind her or learn she is pregnant and can act in accordance with her beliefs. If she is pro life she must be feeling absolute terror. I was in ministry for years. Until a woman finds herself in such an unimaginable situation, it's not fair or right to judge that situation. IF she is pregnant, she needs to seek prenatal care or get as early an abortion as possible. IF she is pregnant, she has DNA proof of who did this to her, regardless the decision she makes. They can save the evidence or there will be evidence.

I don't understand the lack of access to STI testing. I would think TriCare covers STI testing. She doesn't have to explain why she wants testing. If that's not possible, is she against Planned Parenthood? STI testing should be available there or, perhaps, even at a local public health department.

She mentioned other people being present. SOMEONE knows who did this to her. Is her attacker in the service? Is it unusual for her to drink to the point of blacking out? I'm wondering if she was drugged.

Please get yourself some support and encourage her to do the same. You both need and deserve it.

AMA,fnnq3yt,t1_fnlxocb,1587098540.0,"If you want to look into self help books, I recommend researching CPTSD, complex PTSD. CPTSD is not a recognized diagnosis, but it seems more fitting to someone who has experienced numerous traumatic events over a period of time.

Congrats on getting away!!! That took a tremendous amount of bravery.

I am so sorry they didn't find your kidnapper/attacker. 

Have you considered trying to contact Elizabeth Smart or Jaycee Dugaard (?) ? I think they have both written books you may relate to. You are NOT alone in your experience (I know you know that) and connecting with others who share your experience may be helpful."

family,fnnoq47,t3_g2l0ot,1587097508.0,"I am terribly sorry for your loss, and I can understand how disposing of (a frozen embryo?) may be perceived as a loss. Fact is, unless you have the money to continue freezing the embryo, this is already really out of the question. The embryo has to be thawed a certain way and the embryo implanted in a womb ready to receive an embryo by the end of the month. Further costs would be incurred for this process. This is difficult in the best of circumstances. The woman has to undergo a hormone regimen to leave her ready to accept a donor embryo.

Also, you don't have the resources, the money, time, and psychology to raise this baby. You wouldn't be raising a sibling. 

Then, too, there's no guarantee you would have a lifelong relationship with said child. Many siblings fall out, especially ones so far apart in age.

This is an unhealthy obsession. It doesn't bring your parents back or ""give you a sibling,"" except by DNA.

Please search out grief counseling. This is a devastating blow at any age. It's obvious you aren't coping well. Best wishes, OP."

confessions,fnfo2zw,t3_g12gu5,1586911938.0,"Aaaah I miss wearing heels!! I LOVED wearing them. I even wore them after I fractured my pelvis (and healed of course). I broke my leg/ankle in 5 places, tib fib and third metatarsal. Wear the hell out of those shoes and anything else you want to wear on your feet, body, or face. I didn't really start to wear makeup until I turned 40. I do it for me! Even at home, alone, in the middle of a pandemic, I put some on once in a while. Starting tomorrow I think I will start putting on at least a little mascara. This will likely end in a full face of makeup. I do it for the art, for the ritual. What we do FOR OURSELVES is what matters most. By that I mean I am doing it for the self care element, for my mental health. Self love and acceptance. Good on you for not letting what others might think get in the way. This will help bring the right people into your life, people who accept you and encourage you to be yourself."

He not only filmed you without consent, he lied about how he feels about consent, and lied about what he did. That is some crazymaking bullshit. I would feel violated, manipulated, lied to and like I didn't really know this person after all."
rape,fmjxs88,t3_fvmm8e,1586139898.0,"I can relate. It seems like sex is the center of the universe and the driving factor behind partnerships. I genuinely worry I will be alone for the rest of my life; I have already been alone way too damn long. 

Sex IS important, but you are NOT a sexual object, and you deserve a RELATIONSHIP versus a sexual partner. Even though sex is important, there are definitely men and women interested in having a relationship. They will want to know YOU, want to spend time with you, and value you as a PERSON. Time for a heart to heart. If this isn't what he wants, and actions speak louder than words, then it is time to move on. You CAN find someone who values YOU, as a person, who wants something more than just a sex partner/sex object."
