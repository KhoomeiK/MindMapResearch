The point that I'm trying to make, is we are as a country disorganized and going about things in the entirely wrong manner. This should have been handled at the national level from the get go. It should've never reached the point for individual state action to begin with. 

On that note, we've seen how shitty the trump administration is at responding to an actual crisis. But, they're quick to surge into action when Trump's personal monetary gain is being affected.

From my sister's perspective, the hardest obstacles are minimal resources and hospital staffing. So yes.

My initial point is that people need to do individual research and aggregate accurate, succint information on the virus and the spread, take viable countermeasures, and stop relying on biased shitty media outlets."

MMORPG,f9kgr0e,t3_e5g088,1575400111.0,"I've played both pretty extensively for the past couple of years. And here are my thoughts:

When it comes to class complexity, polish, gameplay and combat design, FF14 is a clear winner. I do firmly believe that it is the best MMO currently on the market. The art direction and style might be a little niche, but if you can get past it, you'll have a great time.

BFA is probably the worst WoW expansion, but I'd say that's hardly the issue. Blizzard has insisted on streamlining and dumbing down core gameplay concepts that in their minds will appeal to a more ""casual"" audience to bring in new players. This has had the inverse effect. Professions are inconsequential, leveling is boring and unrewarding, and almost every single class has a 3 button rotation. All of this on top of sloppy writing with core plot developments being retconned left and right.

FF14 has done a phenomenal job and Shadwobringers is a \*very\* good expansion with a great story. The world is brilliant, detailed, and offers far more. There is *always* something to do in Eorzea. From Casino's to leveling alts, to end game raids, it's a blast. I will warn you though, if you're starting from scratch, it might feel like a slog up until level 30-50.

Regardless, highly recommend FF14."

My buddy stepped away to the bathroom and while I was intently focused on the show, an older woman of probably mid 40's (I was 24 at the time), snuck up behind me and grabbed my junk... pretty aggressively. While it was in her hands, she whispered in my ear, ""where's this going tonight?"" All I could say was; ""Home, and to bed."" And removed her hand. She seemed pretty perturbed. 

I was in the Air Force at the time and we constantly recieved briefing after briefing about sexual assault and how female on male assault is statistically unreported 90% of the time. It didn't really become apparent that I was sexually assaulted until many years later during another briefing.
