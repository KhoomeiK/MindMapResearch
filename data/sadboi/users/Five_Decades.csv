Yes and no. Some traits that are desirable for short term mating (dark triad personality traits, a V shaped torso, sexual dimorphism) count against you for long term mating.

For women resources, stability and avoiding abandonment are a major factor in who they pick for long term mating. For short term mating those traits aren't important to women. If anything they want the opposite for short term mating (good looking unstable bad boys)."

Short term mating and long term mating are not the same. Its basically an r (short term. Tons of offspring with dysfunctional women with low paternal investment) vs k (long term. Few offspring with highly functional women and high paternal investment) strategy. 

Red Pill strategy is mostly for short term mating (getting as many women pregnant as possible with as little paternal investment as possible). And the women who are most likely to go for that kind of strategy are women with issues like serious mental health issues, abandonment/abuse backgrounds, neuroticism, self esteem issues, etc.

However anti-black racism seems more long lasting since it was built into our culture. In order to justify the evils of slavery, and for the ownership class to prevent unity among the poor and working class, anti-black racism has been stoked for hundreds of years to keep poor whites and poor blacks divided and to justify the evils of slavery. 

A century ago racism against the Irish, italians, polish, etc. was a major issue. Thats mostly gone in Modern america. anti-semitism is nowhere near as bad as it was a century ago. Anti-asian racism isn't terrible.

Not only that, but when you're young your sense of identity is forming. As a result the things you experience when you're young have a special meaning because they help shape your identity. Music when you're 15 is totally different than music when you're 45. By age 45 your sense of identity has crystallized, art and media at 15 will carry special meaning your whole life since it shapes your sense of identity and self. 

Experiences when you are young have a vitality and meaning that you lose with age. As you get older that magic goes away (some people try to recapture it with drugs though). A kiss, a party, a friendship, a song when you are young and your identity is forming has a special meaning you really can't recapture when you're an adult with a formed personality. 

As you get older you gain life experience and humility, but by then you are bogged down with responsibilities and health limitations you can't enjoy them as much. Your sense of identity solidifies, and even novel experiences become a rerun of a rerun instead of something new and full of life and vitality.

Because the military, economic and medical advantages of creating those machines mean there is a massive demand for them. 

Economics is to a large degree driven by demand. If people demand cars, companies will build them. If they demand tasty food, companies will make it. If people demand cell phones, companies will build them. 

There is a massive demand for machine cognition from both the public sector and private sector. The public sector wants it so it can gain military advantage, deal with disease, grow their economy, allocate resources better, obtain/maintain economic supremacy, gain diplomatic influence, etc. 

The private sector wants it to increase standards of living, solve medical problems, enjoy new entertainments, solve climate change, etc. 

Because of this, the demand is there that it is only a matter of time before we invent it. As long as artificial superintelligence (ASI) means that ASI will lead to higher standards of living, better health, military supremacy, faster economic growth etc, there will be massive private and public sector demand that it be built. 

Because there is a massive demand for ASI, human capital (smart people) and financial capital (investment money) will keep being thrown at it until it happens. 

One of the main drivers of ASI might be the public sector who see it as a potential way to maintain military and economic dominance. 

In my personal opinion, I think there will be a manhattan style project soon to prevent China from obtaining ASI. I think the NATO nations (North America & western europe) will ally with South korea, Japan, taiwan and Israel to innovate ASI so China doesn't get there first. I think that this alliance will happen sometime in the next 5-20 years."

singularity,fqn1pyg,t3_gjtj1j,1589487194.0,"The singularity is when we create machines that are capable of thinking and doing everything thinking allows us to do. Innovate, create patents, perform jobs, problem solve, invent solutions, recognize patterns, create a business, contribute to science, etc. in the most holistic and general sense of the word (we have machines that can engage in something like cognition, but only in extremely narrow ways right now). 

But it is also when machines learn 'how' to think and learn how to upgrade their hardware and software to increase the capacity of their thinking and problem solving. 

Imagine on a 1-10 scale of how good biological humans are at thinking and innovating, a five year old is maybe a 2 and a professor at MIT is a 9. Someone with downs syndrome may be a 2-3, a brilliant scientist or brilliant inventor is a 9-10. The five year old may figure out that the triangle shaped piece goes in the triangle shaped hole, the MIT professor may be helping to solve world hunger, build quantum computers or create affordable renewable energy. 

We will create machines that are a 10 on the 1-10 scale eventually. one thing those machines will do is invent a machine that is a 15, which is beyond human capacity. Those 15s will create a 35, the 35s will create a 100, the 100s will create a 1500, etc until we have machines who can think, problem solve and innovate billions of times better than the best biological brains. The fastest human can run at 26mph, but that is nothing compared to rockets that travel at several thousand mph. 

To those machines, problems that the best human minds would require centuries just to chip away at would be solvable nearly instantly."

If you have 2 kids, daycare for both may cost $2500 a month (its even higher in high cost of living areas). Add in the extra costs for transportation and work related expenses, combined with the tax advantage of being a stay at home parent (stay at home parents can be claimed as dependents I think) and if you have 2 kids, the mother probably needs to earn around 40-50k a year before taxes to even break even by working rather than staying home with 2 kids. Thats not even poor, thats a solidly middle class wages in low cost of living areas."

PurplePillDebate,fqjm69l,t1_fqhrsog,1589411929.0,"> I didn’t expect that to be the case and just thought it was interesting.

Its due to the welfare cliff. If you're a low income woman you can go to work and lose most of your benefits. Or you can be a SAHM and get medicaid, food stamps, housing assistance, tax credits, etc. 

I can't blame them. I think you have to earn 30/hr to make the kinds of benefits you can make by being a poor parent.

What they believe is consistently false and their opinions and beliefs are just a tool to validate their emotions. Ignoring it is much better than engaging.

Sometimes for fun I'll use their own tactics against them. Just make shit up.

Obama created thirty million jobs.

Donald trump supports black lives matter now. He changed his mind.
