schizoaffective,fqtorcu,t3_gktlxk,1589643133.0,"Hey there, I felt pretty similar to you at first, I think. I don’t want to scare you but I never heard voices for a while, it just started with bouts of depression, mania, lots of anxiety, and paranoia. My doc diagnosed me with schizoaffective to which I immediately objected, but they explained it as mostly being due to my paranoia and fixation on the anxiety stuff. Those things I thought just were anxiety actually were pretty out there delusions that I couldn’t tell I was freaking out unreasonably for. It’s impossible for me to truly tell you everything I’m delusional about because to me it just seems like slightly paranoid anxiety! To those around me though, it’s clearly not normal and I guess indicative of something more. I also feel like I don’t “struggle” as much as other people here but I’ve been trying to come to grips with that so I can accept treatment that works. When I’ve been stuck in the grey area of not accepting the diagnosis from the doc, it’s just way worse. I don’t know if it’s just the mental part of knowing it’s a more “scary” illness than, like, depression, or if I truly am not schizoaffective; but either way I want to listen to the docs because they sure as hell want to help me know more about the illness and myself so I can get better. 

My doc prescribed me Seroquel and mood stabilizers which helped with therapy, but honestly I’m a bad patient and I get really paranoid that the meds are trying to keep me from seeing the world the way it really is. I’m also pretty young at 21, so my delusions and hallucinations have been getting worse and worse for about a year. Not accepting a diagnosis for a long part of that is pretty unsafe and stupid of me, and I want to help you make better decisions than me. Bottom line: just don’t compare what you think the illness should look like “on” a person to how you feel because everyone with this is different.

Sorry I ranted I got carried away"

KGATLW,fofponj,t3_g706sv,1587740582.0,"I listened to oddments (This album seems to get the short end of the stick around here for some reason) first as well! Then I went to Mind fuzz and I couldn’t be happier with it. Bunch of groovy, lo-fi shit on the back end of that album. Followed that up with Flying Microtonal Banana and I think I haven’t listened to another band since. I think float along (more garage and psychedelic) and 12 Bar Bruise (very punky-surf rock) are the most like classic 60’s garage albums, by neither quite has the same feeling as Oddments, to me at least. I’d say Float Along or Mind Fuzz as the next one you should try out. Maybe even Willoughby’s Beach cause that thing is insane IMO and very surf rock like."

If it was something more minor like trying to link up two random phrases in two different songs I would be more inclined to believe that they wouldn’t put that much energy into this, but it’s a pretty easy way to remind listeners of another one of their works while still telling a different story. It’s one of the many reasons the Gizzverse is so cool to me."

Gizzverse,fmihili,t1_fmigc0l,1586109683.0,"I see civilization/technology parallels as well. Han deals with his creation as a cyborg, as Blue functions in a world with technology encroaching on the wild untamed west. If Han-tyumi = humanity, I think that these narrative parallels are hugely evident in almost all of their work. Blue could be a representation akin to the  cyborg; a mix of wild humanity and structured technology."
Gizzverse,fmifyt3,t1_fmieotm,1586108803.0,"Well I for one go with the thought that ELTS is from before the invention of the Gizzverse idea, but I firmly believe the new stuff still actively ties the old stuff in. I think we’ll continue to see lyrical and thematic parallels but I don’t think ELTS gives a lot, if any, narrative parts of the Gizzverse. The whole multiverse aspect can allow the band to have ELTS (and by extension 12BB, Oddments, and Float Along- Fill Your Lungs) be its own narrative (if you believe me that it was written before the Gizzverse “began”) outside of the other stuff, but still part of the greater picture by the new lyrics and songs bringing the themes back and not the entire story. 

So I think that’s what is going on with the lyrics in question and we’ll keep getting more things like it. There could be more connection than I’m thinking, and if that’s the case I think more music will make it clear that which isn’t so clear right now. 

Maybe if Blue is a god then he is another form of Han-tyumi."
Gizzverse,fmide9i,t3_fvh8zv,1586107358.0,I think there’s a loose connection but I see it more as a play on “eyes like the sky” meaning “blue eyes” vs meaning “the sky is like an eye” in the ELTS artwork.

linguistics,fldcnuj,t1_flcsmyy,1585061765.0,"Does the social media culture give people freedom to use the language in a similar way? So if gay men can bring AAVE into the greater gay community, why can’t Youtubers/ influencers use language brought to them through influencers/ Youtubers who speak AAVE already/ they have heard used in their online community. Is the argument that Youtubers and the like are appropriating because there’s a power dynamic at play when it’s the people already at the top of the social pyramid (in this case I’m calling YouTube the “top of the social pyramid” even though it’s not)? This feels like a double standard that we shouldn’t be policing people about. If you speak the AAVE “incorrectly” it’s still language right? And the people who hear it and understand it won’t have a problem with it, but the people who don’t understand it or believe it is spoken wrongly will have a problem with it. That sounds like every language around and what happens when out-group people try to fit in. People are going to say words they like and borrowing from other cultures’ languages is a healthy and normal thing to do in my eyes. 
To me this has shades of being no more than any other form of prescriptivism. I want to tread lightly on that last bit though since I can see the side of the argument that this would harm people who are discriminated against because of their use of AAVE."

I guess I still recommend it for a beginner because if they really like the topic they’ll learn more about it and see what’s wrong with the book later. Reading this first isn’t going to ruin their ability to do linguistics in the future, and it’s going to give them a solid base they can understand without a teacher guiding them. Pinker is writing for a large, not-linguistically-oriented audience, but I feel like that’s what they are looking for. It’s not supposed to teach them how to do linguistics but it without a doubt introduces them to the different aspects of it (big ideas as you call them).

If you don’t use amph often I’d keep it below 35mg but that’s cause I’d rather feel the M and not get over stimulated and too anxious. That’s really the biggest thing besides the heart rate problems, but i figure if you’re thinking about mixing these two you don’t care about your heart lol.

Listen to some music that relaxes you, maybe watch a funny show you can focus on, and you always can try to sleep it off. Just remember it’s only weed and it can’t physically hurt you. Panic attacks and cardiac events feel really similar to some people, and the anxiety from the weed might make you really believe something bad is going on when in reality you just are overthinking things because you’re high as fuck. For me, talking to the people around me, focusing on my sensations of the world or a show, and music help a lot when I freak from the psychedelics."

Edibles tend to be stronger, more nauseating, and more panic inducing to people who aren’t experienced with them. Sounds like your friend had a panic attack and an upset stomach from too much THC. Sometimes edibles made in a clandestine setting have uneven distributions of weed in each piece. Even daily smokers can have the same reaction as you if they have too many edibles/THC. Weed isn’t so safe to the point where it doesn’t have negatives, and it sounds like you aren’t really aware of how it works. I suggest researching how the drug affects people and understanding dosages of edibles before trying them again."

Psychedelics,ew8dubr,t1_ew8aym9,1565208083.0,"I think it’s a debated topic by psychedelic users if weed is worth it or not. In your case, and in mine, weed is addictive and not good to be doing 24/7 but it’s hard to quit. Since using psychedelics, I have been able to bring the introspective parts of weed to the forefront when I smoke. To me, weed can be used as a tool to make you a better person like any other psych, but it has a higher chance for abuse because of its non-psychedelic effects. I mean to say the negatives you might be facing with weed use is caused by overuse or use in the wrong “set and setting” similar to psychedelics. Weed has such a massive profile of effects that there’s a lot more going on with the substance than the, more or less, peripheral psychedelia. Using other traditional psychedelic causes weeds psychedelic effects to become more noticeable, thus changing how the substance is perceived by you. It ceased to be a daily thing because you’re bored or anxious, and becomes something that can be used sparingly but worthwhile. Weed is really addictive to me actually because of the dissociative aspects and introspection, but using so much with psychs helped me realize what weed can be good for and what it can be bad for. Bad for parties and family places, but it’s a lot more fun to go out in the woods with a couple j’s and walk around than bringing a few beers. Bottom line I guess is that if you want to smoke, you’ll smoke and the effects might be different than you’re used to, but embrace the fact that the new aspect of the drug may not simply be a change in effects. It may be you growing up and a fuller understanding of your body and mind due to psychedelic use. 

I love smoking some bud on the weekends or maybe a night or two a week, but trying to be a productive member of society while stoned all the time is a fool’s errand IMO. Any stoner who has really become addicted to it knows that “functioning stoner” is about as good as “functioning alcoholic.” Psychedelics regulate use by tolerance and (depending on the person) traumatic nature. Weed lacks both of these, but I have thought many times that weeds psychedelic effects do actually have a very low tolerance point, the other effects do not have this quick-building tolerance.
Keep taking psychs if they work more for you, but re-learning how to smoke weed might be in your best interest. I think people have become so caught up with the “weed is harmless” kind of thing that they forget that it’s a very psychoactive plant and we don’t know how it really works yet. I apologize for the long ass reply and the rambling, but I hoped this helps a little bit."

MDMA,ew7u1yw,t1_ew7tkqn,1565197177.0,"No the primary difference between Meth and MDMA is the entactogenic effects (more or less the empathy and connected-ness). This is what I’d identify with the “magic” of MDMA, and meth simply doesn’t have that side of it. No risk of losing magic, just you’ll crave more and more of it because of the stronger dopamine interaction than with MDMA. Molly still has that chance too don’t get me wrong, but the magic is what MDMA is all about, and why people prefer it over meth."

Not because of tolerance or losing the magic or serotonin depletion, but for your physical health on top of it. Stims are a favorite drug for me but can’t do it often. Keeping your body healthy in other ways (exercise, sleep, diet) gives you a lot more freedom to take drugs because your body will handle everything better, and IMO stims are the hardest on the body so bodily health is really recommended if you take stims recreationally."

But yeah, your friend just had a rough go it seems, probably had to do with weed in his case, but I see him as an anomaly in the world of MDMA use haha."
MDMA,evsoaj5,t1_evsnm9p,1564752260.0,"There’s no bad side to smoking the day after you roll and it might actually be more fun because you’ll have that comedown. Smoking on the roll has absolutely no possibility of “killing” the roll, however, the two drugs synergize very well and the combo is a tried and true formula for awesomeness. If you get anxious from either of the two drugs it might be better to hold off on the combo though, just cause it might make the roll less enjoyable, but also a stronger roll IMO. Weed helps bring out the colors and music that MDMA is already enhancing to another level, but I imagine it can also worsen the anxiety in those who get it from MD. My recommendation is just to smoke grass like a damn chimney when you roll because it’s honestly heaven."

The fact that OP mentions that they hear people’s thoughts in person and over long distances is worrisome. Not fear mongering here, just stating some possible explanation that OP is refusing to accept. This is also worrisome."
Thetruthishere,evs7po8,t1_evrz375,1564733869.0,How do you know though? What you described is literally a symptom of schizophrenia.

Drugs,evrqc23,t1_evrq04g,1564715344.0,"For me on lower doses this works every time. I think I read on tripsafe.org that like over 80% feel “extreme fear/ anxiety” on a trip of 200ug, which is 100% accurate to me. That number tapers off to 0% when taking a dose below 100ug. When you take too much for yourself, I think it becomes almost impossible to come back to reality on your own."

MDMA,evh2dd6,t3_cjwobp,1564519526.0,"Your question isn’t rapey. I use Molly water occasionally and usually use water, however, I’ve heard good things from friends of coke/Pepsi covering the taste. Don’t put it in anything metal when you mix it. Shake it in a plastic bottle till it’s desolved, which may take some time (5 minutes).   Anything more than 125 mg/ 12 oz liquid is gonna taste pretty bad if it’s real M also. Hope this helps I learned from some experienced Molly water experts, who all swear it’s the best way to do it. Warning though, it’s kinda rough on the stomach so eat a real balanced and healthy couple meals the day of the roll or before depending on if you’re taking it in the morning or night. Effects will be more intense but quicker lasting because of the better bioavailability when taking it dissolved in water, can’t say for if it’s in another liquid though. Have fun stay safe!"
