ptsd,fqwbg3b,t3_gk595q,1589698590.0,"First off, condolences for that because that sounds quite terrifying. I've never had anything similar out of the 15 surgeries I've had. Mine were traumatic in different ways than what you described above. Though, I still have had problems with sleep since I got nightmares about mine as well.

For one, grounding is probably your number one friend here. Sit somewhere and close your eyes (leave the lights on around you or do what makes you feel comfortable). As you're doing it, take note in what your body feels (points of contact, smells, sounds, etc.). Describe the room that you are in. If you can't close your eyes, that's okay too. Just do what makes you comfortable.

As a person that has been under several times, it is pretty much a given to loose track of surroundings since that is the entire point of anesthesia. Due to that nature, it is best if you ground yourself or find normal objects in the room and try to ""trick"" your head into realizing that you're not under/ in surgery. I say 'trick' but it's really just grounding because the feelings can be really strong to the point that you don't really recognize where you really are versus where your head is taking you. I hope this helped and hope medical staff takes you seriously from here on out when it comes to this."
ptsd,fqothv4,t3_gimawd,1589524384.0,Yep. This happened to me last fall with a secondary trauma and now I have to cope with it and process it. I just numbed myself to oblivion and then it all got triggered by numerous events.

ptsd,fqos5h1,t3_gk2kei,1589523260.0,"That is a common trick that trauma does to you. It makes you minimize it when it was legitimate.

ptsd,fqfatha,t1_fqfamsj,1589321628.0,Thanks. This a recent discovery so it’s still quite raw in comparison to the other traumas that are more processed and worked on.
ptsd,fqf92xr,t1_fqcqphi,1589320770.0,Thank you. I question if it’s trauma because I watched it. I wasn’t involved with any of it besides being a witness. It doesn’t help that I have additional traumas so it just all blurs into each other.

ptsd,fq59lhp,t3_ggs5g7,1589097161.0,I was fairly quick. I’ve had multiple traumas so I’m still a work in progress. I probably will always be but that’s the whole point. It became manageable within 8 months and I’ve been on a good track ever since. There’s ups and downs but overall 8 months to become manageable.
ptsd,fq59ana,t3_ggrcpy,1589096859.0,"I have this problem too, only that December is the worst month for me (5 different anniversary dates each about a week apart). I will say that I’m healing from my traumas so this might not apply heavily at the moment. 

One of the things I realized about anniversaries is that it can be anything you make it. If it’s really big, that’s okay. If it’s on the back burner and all that comes up is “oh, X event happened X years ago” that’s okay too. Just like we celebrate holidays in our calendar year, trauma anniversaries can be similar too. It could be somber, happy, or a mix. It could symbolize a day that you change and be a new person. It could grieve the person you should’ve been. TLDR: it’s anything you make it to be. 

As for coping with the nasty emotions that come up, it’s taken me a lot of time just to be comfortable with feeling them. Deep breathing and meditations are good. Grounding is key, especially if it’s difficult to tell the past from present. Find and describe the room or place you’re in with each of the 5 senses. It’s also possible to let yourself feel them but not interact with it. What I mean is that you note what comes up but don’t go into why you feel that way. You just stick with what is known for the emotion rather than debate the unknown. Hope this helps."
ptsd,fq58l1p,t3_ggur0r,1589096144.0,"Yep. I feel weak for letting something traumatized

ptsd,fpulag9,t3_gfaf1g,1588915943.0,"In terms of seriousness, that can't really be avoided from what I have noticed with myself. This is my perspective so I could easily be wrong here. My nightmares aren't as strong anymore like they used to be so that also creates differences in this answer.

For me, I usually will get up and try to ground myself rather than trying to interact with the nightmare and the thoughts that it provokes. I've found that splashing water on my face and having my hands under running water is helpful. Otherwise, holding a block of ice would also have the same effect."
ptsd,fpukkiu,t3_gfl0dl,1588915366.0,"One of the things that I recently discovered is the ability to give myself a break with this thought. I guess I'm coming from the perspective that I had childhood trauma and that I was only a child when it happened. Children are smart and resilient, yet they perceive the world differently than adults do. That's something I have to keep in mind for my traumas and thinking ""it's not that bad""."
ptsd,fpscc0b,t3_gewr1k,1588871074.0,"Yes. I have medical trauma so the idea might seem different. 

I feel weak for not being able to “get over it”. I’m a logical thinker. When those mix, it is a bad combination because I just end up feeling stupid for wasting time being caught up in the past when I can’t reverse it. I can end up feeling stupid for feeling a certain way because “it’s emotions and logic takes precedence over emotional thinking” according to my brain.

Then, if I tell my story (lot of surgeries) people call me “strong” and “brave” and all those glorifying words. They’re not wrong, but I feel that it pressures me that I’m not supposed to be traumatized and instead grateful. I feel weak for letting something that I’m supposed to be grateful for traumatize me."

These are the same people that have done crazy shit in their teenage years all because of the original trauma of separation. I had to see the the living hell that they made it for everybody around and self destruct themselves in depression. I would never repeat those years.

I feel like attachment issues are hard to put into words because it’s such a fundamental area of development that we don’t have. It’s literally the first thing to develop and we lost that, making it extremely difficult to word it for those that do not know. What’s worse is that they don’t know because they have developed attachments and it’s a no brainer to them.

I also can't comprehend how attachment is a normal, everyday thing for people. They say ""I love you"" so easily. Meanwhile, I'm over here barely even able to say ""I"" in ""I love you"". When I do say it, I'm almost nearly on the floor crying because it's so incredible, overwhelming, weird, accepting, and etc. (I can't really put it into words so sorry if it's a jumbled mess).

I’ve joked about going under being easier than a difficult thing that is going on. It’s so odd but I literally grew up in the medical culture so it’s just my normalcy that no one relates to. It’s hard. *sigh*

For example, something such as “I’m going to be traumatized by another hospital stay” turns into “this hospital stay will not be easy, but I have resources to get through it even if it is difficult”. It’s realistic, but also manageable if that makes sense. 

Not only that, you literally cannot get away from your triggers, which can feel really daunting and painful. As a patient, I hate that I’m going to have to face more triggers and that I cannot get away from it. But I also know that I am capable of handling what comes my way and that I’m doing far better than my brain thinks it is.

mentalhealth,fmt95ev,t3_fx89zy,1586368856.0,"I had 15 surgeries in childhood and still have more to go (~2 left). While it’s not cancer, I can say to take it a step at a time. That’s probably something you have heard a lot from other people. However, it’s so easy to get caught up with everything in any form of treatment, including cancer. 

I’m not saying that this is the expectation because there are so many ways to go about this. In fact, this is something I have had to learn: expectations vs reality. If it’s a good day, take the time to celebrate that it’s a good day for you and your body. If it’s a bad day, take the time to acknowledge it and process it. Just take it as it comes because that helps *a lot*, at least from my perspective. I could be wrong. 

This is probably the exact opposite of what you’d want to hear. The trauma may keep on going but that doesn’t mean that it’s impossible to “cure”. As someone that still faces more surgeries, from my personal experience I can tell you that I no longer view them the same way anymore (in a good way). It’s not comparable to cancer but reframing is indeed possible with the right help and support.

mentalhealth,fl5tcuf,t1_fl5r20z,1584845193.0,"Calm app is good. They have some free meditations but it’s also a subscription if you want to go through more. Headspace is also good and it’s the same concept. Honestly, I’ve been using YouTube because there’s a mix of everything on there."
Anxiety,fl5o2il,t1_fl3d95u,1584841402.0,I didn’t think I would actually be able to have this possibility. I pretty much lived with anxiety my whole life and never sought help until last year. It’s refreshing and relieving to not have anxiety all the time or at least be more controlled and managed.
Anxiety,fl5nvur,t1_fl4on11,1584841272.0,Thank you. The same to you as well.
Anxiety,fl5nugq,t1_fl44mgk,1584841244.0,Happy cake day by the way! Hope your journey to recovery is going well too.
Anxiety,fl52y4h,t1_fl4woh7,1584827300.0,"Thank you. I’m sure once I actually talk to my therapist about that attack, I’ll figure out how to stay calmer. It was over a topic that I haven’t covered yet in therapy and hence the anxiety attack."
Anxiety,fl4k62k,t1_fl4ihaa,1584815282.0,"I’m glad that you’re making progress, even if it’s a week! It doesn’t get better quickly and takes a lot of time to figure out how to cope. Hope your anxiety improves as well."
Anxiety,fl4jlhk,t1_fl3gq1l,1584814928.0,Thank you. I’m glad to be in a better spot. One thing that I do need to remember is to actually take the time to practice the coping skills on a daily basis rather than every 3-4 days sometimes.
Anxiety,fl4j8gd,t1_fl4h3sw,1584814705.0,"Yeah, pretty accurate."
Anxiety,fl4fwj4,t3_fmilxs,1584812676.0,"I feel this. Exercise was also my go to when I was stressed. This is a good time to find other coping mechanisms or exercises since you’re not able to go to the gym. “If plan A doesn’t work, what’s the plan B” is the kind of thinking that my head has been doing. 

I know this is strange but yoga might be of interest. I haven’t done it yet but I’ve been wanting to at least try it."
Anxiety,fl4f8i4,t1_fl44qrp,1584812270.0,Thank you
Anxiety,fl4f5rf,t1_fl4c760,1584812223.0,"I’ve been learning different coping skills such as meditations. As far as medications goes, I wasn’t super complicated to be honest. So far, I’ve gotten by with Prozac. It didn’t take me a long time to find the right medication. I guess I was lucky and found the needle in the haystack very quickly. 

Hope your anxiety improves. That sucks to have anxiety attacks on a daily basis."
Anxiety,fl3yndi,t1_fl3y630,1584801756.0,It really is! I feel like I’m finally getting a handle on things and figuring things out.
Anxiety,fl3xwso,t1_fl3u59o,1584801232.0,Thank you
Anxiety,fl3rwtn,t1_fl3r66f,1584796388.0,Thank you. I’m glad that my anxiety is getting better. Therapy and meds have seriously helped.
Anxiety,fl3qepf,t1_fl39mcl,1584794986.0,Congratulations on your progress! Winter time is a huge trigger for me so the fact that it’s spring has also helped a lot.
Anxiety,fl3qa2a,t1_fl3pnyv,1584794866.0,Thank you. Hope you’re doing well.
Anxiety,fl3q7io,t1_fl3epbf,1584794800.0,Therapy has been SUPER beneficial for me. I’m in CBT and found the right meds as well. Medication was a game changer for me at least.
ptsd,fl1qxpo,t3_fly9i5,1584734463.0,"That person before my trauma will never exist again and it hurts. I had childhood trauma (at a month old as the first one) so it just straight up means that I have always been my post trauma self and never remembered myself without trauma. 

It's still good advice though but I grieve that person and who I might have been."
mentalhealth,fl1qelh,t3_flw26e,1584734158.0,"It's incredibly helpful. As a person that is in therapy right now, it's worth it. The first session felt like I was opening my entire life story to them even though it wasn't that much when I look back on that first appointment. 

To put it short, I can say the things that I need to let out that would possibly offend someone else. Not that I do this all the time, but they really don't judge people even if you say things that you wouldn't say out loud. 

You know those thoughts that you have about people or things that's so fucked up to the point that you would seem like a psychopath if you said it? I've said things like that in therapy and it's honestly kind of relieving. Not that I do this every time, but there was one instance where this was helpful to say and they didn't judge me for it (even though it was a really fucked up thought)."
ptsd,fkwy9k6,t1_fkwmr0m,1584611210.0,"The entire mechanism behind trauma is fascinating. It sucks that the shield is often more harmful than good. Sometimes, I need to be feeling the emotions so that I can actually identify them and work through them rather than hide."
mentalhealth,fkwlomd,t1_fkvyamn,1584596464.0,I usually do guided ones for what I’m feeling that day. It helps me unwind from the chaos. Meditating also puts me to sleep so I don’t do it in the day for that reason.
ptsd,fkwljek,t1_fkwlbxg,1584596322.0,Right?! It’s the worst. Can’t my head just accept that it’s real and actually see that? Apparently not. It’s annoying when it’s numb or completely shocked from rediscovering the trauma for the millionth time.
ptsd,fkwjgpp,t3_fl1ecl,1584594372.0,"All the time. Some days, it doesn't feel real even if something triggers me. Other days, reality will hit me in the face and then I realize that it's real."
mentalhealth,fkt57te,t3_fkhl4m,1584506618.0,"That’s how I coped with everything as well. I became numb and shoved it all down until it exploded. Like the other commenter said, meditation is helpful. It helps you focus on something and take note of different things."
