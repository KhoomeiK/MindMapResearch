I remember I just felt the need to do certain things more and but i iust thought I was being extra ""careful"" about the doors being locked and the stove and I didnt see it as ""obsessive"". It only occured to me when it started branching out into other more trivial things I just was kinda like okay.. I may have a slight problem.

No one I know in my family has ocd, to my knowledge. I also have slight anxiety which I believe goes hand in hand with the ocd. Ive also had a few traumatic experiences as a child- most all of them were sexual abuse. I grew up just fine apart from the ocd and anxiety so I'm not sure if I would attribute it to that. I do wonder if the trauma had never happened if I would have ever developed ocd, and to be honest I don't think I would have. 

Doing it alone is hard but I really try not to let it get to me. I don't make it my identity and its really just a small part of who I am, so for the most part I ignore it. Its wierd to me to think that I have OCD because before, I never really imagined myself having any sort of disorder."

Ok well that definitely makes sense and you're justified in feeling the way you do. Anyone would feel the same way.

You could text your friends, send voice notes or facetime them like any friend would. Keep a close bond even when you guys aren't together. If you guys have a group chat, set a date where you all just get together. Once a month even. I know it is easier said than done but they're just some suggestions to keep connections and improve your friendships

 A bit of social anxiety is normal for teenagers and is okay, but if you fel like it interferes with your life, talk to your parents so you can get help for it. They are there to help you and maybe the only way you can get help. 

Otherwise, training yourself to be more confident in social settings could really help. If you can build your esteem and fake your confidence, it can come more naturally and make social situations easier. Sounds silly I know but it works.

If you have family, try spending some time with them or reaching out to them for help. Or maybe you have a close friend, that's what they are there for. Talk to them and tell them how you feel

I'm sure your friends dont hate you, if they're your real friends. That's why they're still your friends. If you're comfortable, tell them how you feel. Also Try spending more time with them and just living in the moment with them. This would help reassure you and keep your mind off of things"

I started my game and when you do this it creates a new clean sims 3 folder.  I started a new save and it worked perfect. So I took my old save file from the desktop (saves folder) and added it to the new sim 3 folder and when I played it glitched again. I decided the save was corrupted so I saved my family using edit town. Deleted the save and started a new one with the saved family and all the glitching/lags/errors were gone. I did have to move all my mods and cc from the old sims 3 to the new one but it worked alot better! Anyway hope this helped 


 Feel free to ask questions :) goodluck"

And I really never said I needed 20 dollars an hour either literally anything would have been ok, but I applied everywhere and got almost virtually nothing"
WorkOnline,ezw3phk,t3_d29f5f,1568207037.0,"I know you said you live in a 3rd world country and rev wages are good over there but I would still advise you to keep looking for something else. On rev you'd work 4 hours for like 8 dollars but if you find somethings else worth your time you could work like 4 hours and at the very least earn 20 dollars, making it more worth your time imo. But still, if it helps I got accepted to rev and am still currently looking hard for an online job. Recently decided to try rev out again and I just couldn't bring myself to do it, that's just how bad it is over there. Anyway goodluck and I hope you find something that works for you."

OnlineESLTeaching,ezp97mi,t1_ezm37n7,1568035896.0,They usually have a drop down on registration where you select your country. I like to be honest just in case they have a way of finding out. I guess in some cases you could just say you're native and it's no problem if you can pass but I'd be paranoid they'll find out via my ip address or something and fire me anyway
