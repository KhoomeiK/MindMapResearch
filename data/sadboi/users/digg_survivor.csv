I finally asked a buddy that basically only fucked with married women (were not friends anymore, yes I know he's a shit human) and the way he explained it was that married women will kiss and not tell because they have more to lose (usually kids and a house as well as the spouse) so they basically keep their mouth shut about shenanigans way better than the single ladies. And with the amount of attention I got I think there's way more dudes that try to get with married women than I previously thought."
