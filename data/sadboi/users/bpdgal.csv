BPDsupport,fe8vfb7,t3_eo07oc,1578931457.0,"I can tell that you genuine love your partner and I'm really happy you want to help.

First and foremost, if you want to be there for him, you need to be understanding and have a lot of patience like never before. Some may argue that you're his girlfriend not his punching bag or that you're not his therapist BUT THE THINGS IS WE DIDNT ASK FOR THIS EITHER. That's the number one thing. Never expect a person with bpd to be able to rationalize or not get carried away with their emotion because that's asking them to act normal a.k.a without bpd. So whenever he is in an episode, you need to figure out if he's the type that needs space or the type that you need to be pushy with. As his girlfriend, Im sure you know him better.

Next, we have a black and white mentality, an extreme one, and it can always change or be two things at once (the term is ""splitting""). Do you get me here? For example, there are times when Im so affectionate to my boyfriend but a single wrong statement or action (no matter how small) will turn the switch from ""god, i love you and i wanna marry you"" to ""i hate you so much. I knew i shouldn't have been in a relationship with you. I need to leave you asap. Good bye. Let's break up."" One way of dealing with this is to assure him that you understand, and overwhelm him with your love depending on his love language (actions, material, words, etc.) My boyfriend always gets me back to myself whenever he kisses me passionately or buys all the food I love haha. It's simple things like that which can mean a lot. 

There may be times he'll seem distant or want to break things up. Please know he DOESNT mean it. He's just having an episode. Assure him you're not going anywhere. In this situation, you're gonna have to learn from experience on which is the better route: talking to him until he's out of the episode or give him space until he comes back and apologizes. Which, judging from your post, is what he does. This will happen LOTS of times and I ask you to not get tired of it, please. And never doubt yourself or take it personally. My boyfriend used to blame himself or ask me if his love isnt enough and it broke my heart. Never ever take it personally, please. And never show your partner that you take it personally because later on, this will be a baggage for them and become another reason why you'll be better off without them.

That's all I can say for now but please dont shy away from asking advice or anything. You can tell me specific situations you need help with and I'll happily help out. Having bpd is so exhausting and destructive, which is why I admire people who actually loves us. Im here for you both."

BPD,exaayk9,t1_ex9o7ul,1566103661.0,"Sigh I know. The hard part too is not knowing how to explain it to the people you love. I think it hurts the most whenever they take the blame and think it's their fault or shortcoming when really, you're just having a horrible horrible episode. It's most frustrating when it's over something so trivial like the ""after one seemingly innocent comment"""
