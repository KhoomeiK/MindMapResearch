MMORPG,fo9nidf,t3_g66q4v,1587624847.0,This game and its failed hopes crushed my soul.  I wish the devs just kept strong and made this the WoW slayer.  I believe this game single handedly killed the MMO genre for a good while.
relationship_advice,fo2lcjl,t1_fo29zvk,1587466726.0,That's a really mature choice.  Most guys are burdened with having to stoke their ego by sleeping with someone to fill some void.  If you can find confidence in yourself then you have no need for sex you see.  It's just another addiction like gambling and drugs
relationship_advice,fo292mf,t3_g5afra,1587453708.0,"sex is complex mate.  If you don't want to date anyone right now I  think you should stick to texting and flirting.  A womans heart isn't something you should awaken if you have no plans on loving her....now if the woman you find is looking for the same thing as you FOR SURE and is VERY SURE then this can work but I'm telling you from experience.  sex always gets messy.  in my personal opinion you can find something better with your time than risking pregnancy of a stranger, STDs, hurt feelings, drama etc and just work out or something man.  Watch porn and work on yourself and what you want from your future wife"
relationship_advice,fo28tpy,t3_g5agdv,1587453468.0,This doesn't sound like anything bad to me.  It sounds like he was having a hard time with other things and that this maybe was just a time mentally he needed some space to just be okay.  Personally I can relate and take a lot of time to decompress my feelings due to past abuse.  I am a very passionate lover but sometimes I require my own thinking space just to be okay and give my best to my partner.  I think the best thing you can do to help him is show him you're happy to give him a little space whenever he needs and to ask politely that once hes able you can return to the normal cuddle schedule!  I wish you luck MMkay and would love if you two were reunited in cuddles soon!
relationship_advice,fo28mwi,t3_g5akdb,1587453284.0,If you care about this woman stay strong for her.  This sounds to me like the distance is hurting her.  Long distance relationships can often get hard when you want so dearly to see this person.  It's a very hard thing but maybe this long distance relationship is more than her heart can take.  The closer she becomes to you the more she wants to meet you and hug you...Maybe try to make a plan to meet this girl to show her how much she means.
relationship_advice,fo28ewf,t3_g5ahl5,1587453068.0,It is my strong thought that money doesn't make happiness.  If you are with the wrong man then you won't feel love even in the biggest mansion he can buy.  When I was young there was this short film that touched my heart.  It was about a couple who were homeless together living on the street.  The man would steal food for his woman and do his best to keep her safe from harm.  They were happy.  They only needed each other.  Find the man that makes you feel like a queen and treats you right no matter what his job is!
relationship_advice,fo282n3,t3_g5ahor,1587452744.0,It's normal to be attracted to something new.  These feelings can fade shortly.  He may also appear charming but that doesn't mean in the long run he would treat you with loyalty.  If your boyfriend is loyal and right to you then you owe it to him to not act on those feelings you have.  Loyalty goes both ways!  be attracted to his friend and even talk to him.  but maybe be honest with your boyfriend and work with him to find a solution to your circumstance!  Looks are not everything.  Remember we aren't born choosing that and mental attraction matters a lot more to someone with experience.  I bet if you told your boy those things turned you on he'd want to role play as a bad boy for you.  you might be able to get the best of both worlds.  maybe you could tell him you think its interesting how his friend acts cocky and state that you think he could be more playful with you.  If hes willing to accommodate your desires and fantasies then you have a good man!
relationship_advice,fo27673,t1_fo274s4,1587451898.0,whats important is that he makes you happy and hes loyal
relationship_advice,fo274s4,t3_g51dw1,1587451861.0,"while its very taboo, keep in mind some main countries like the netherlands for example have an age of consent at 16.  I think it is normal to have a certain admiration for the human body in its most pure and healthy stage.  we are naturally attracted to health and also most people have some sort of taboo fixation that is exciting for them simply because it is ""against the rules"" according to society and we love to be rebels.  If he is acting on his feelings and pursuing women below 18 def don't let that happen but if he is only thinking these things and has some fantasies that don't harm anyone then I think thats ok!"
relationship_advice,fo25s22,t3_g4ws1j,1587450620.0,"This is absolutely a big choice!  for me personally I think my parents kicking me out when I turned 18 while continuing to support my fuckup older brother is what lead to me not talking to them to this day along with a lot of other factors.  But if they hadn't kicked me out we may have had a chance to work on those.  Statistically times have changed from when your husband remembers being 18.  Things cost 10x more, society is more complex with many areas you can fail,  modern statistics show that college students now live at home on average until age 30 with parents support.  If he wants your son to go to college I hope hes ready for that.."

MMORPG,es19km6,t1_es0sx5c,1561492031.0,yeah around the time the first expansion was made they improved the storytelling which gets better the further you get.  Also the combat really picks up when you have more skills to be weaving in.  It starts slow as the Global cooldown is longer than in WoW but this is intentional to allow you to choose between more meaningful abilities by end game at a pace that your mind can grasp.  A small variation between action and strategy and less twitch oriented.  The raids are pretty fun and generally polished end game.

MMORPG,erzzd6f,t3_c55dkf,1561459643.0,Final Fantasy xiv is currently the best mmo community.  Dps meters are allowed but flaming someone for performance is not.  They have also recently cracked down on anyone trying to sell gold for real money so it has a working economy!   The game has fates which are events that players travel around and complete together like world quests from wow but more engaging with large parties farming and has some of the best raids along with guild and player housing to keep you working together on fun side stuff! All in all its a must play in 2019. New expansion drops in 3 days.

There's also The box grammer error

n64,erzyt3f,t1_erzyp2y,1561458895.0,There was also a glitch that only the gold cart had that was later fixed in 1.1 if you fight Ganon and he knocks your sword out of your hand you can save the game and restart it as sword less link. This enables a plethora of other glitches.  Pretty fun stuff!
n64,erzyp2y,t1_erzt93y,1561458738.0,You're doing it wrong.  Haha. The original release of oot was gold for early buyers they were hard to find and sold out.  This was version 1.0 later they dropped 1.1 with Grey carts and then a year later a bug fix version 1.2 was released where they also changed Ganondorfs blood from red to green.

WiiHacks,ervenja,t1_erv69az,1561313808.0,yes this it has to be a specific USB port.  also the wii doesnt like every type of HDD.  I use a 128gb SD card for mine 20$ at walmart.  personally I find its the most reliable method.  try a random flash drive you have to rule out the HDD you're using

GameDeals,er6muok,t1_er6ls1k,1560551478.0,I enjoy searching for the Koroks and the hidden chests in the dungeons and at first the weapon durability bothered me a bit more and while i think the weapon durability system could use a little work I think that it was kind of the only way to make enemies drop usable weapons without overloading your inventory over time.. Plus the master sword feels that much better when you get it because of these because it seems like a man's weapon compared to this other junk and gives it meaning.  My only wish is that it would auto swap to the next weapon in your inventory when one broke.

FinalFantasy,eqywrc9,t1_eqywmsj,1560390574.0,I full heart believe 7 remake will be the best Rpg in a decade
FinalFantasy,eqywmsj,t1_eqy318e,1560390520.0,I guess I'm just their target audience because I like all the 13 games as well as 15 a lot they aren't the best but I think they are solid entries. When you make a ton of games not every one will be 10/10. But I think recently they are doing great.  Wow is on the decline so tons of new 14 players and new expansion seems great. I get why some people have really high expectations but I think in the last 3 years square has proven they can do multiple projects with a lot of success.  I'm honestly not buying into the hype. I haven't even watched the latest trailers for 7 remake but I have faith that most of their good team and budget is weighed on 7 release because they can't afford for this one to be a miss there is too much riding on it
PS4Deals,eqyw3tz,t1_eqy6cou,1560390292.0,Thanks so much for the reply man! I was just on mobile so I could research them at the time but I'm interested in trying some japan exclusives
FinalFantasy,eqxxjgv,t1_eqxxgcd,1560375065.0,"Ff12 remake was solid, ff10 remake was solid"
FinalFantasy,eqxxgcd,t1_eqxwebl,1560375037.0,I personally love kh3 and i think the over hype is what made the reviews tough. People wanted a game that simply isn't possible with the kh3 formula. Like kh2 was the best game you can make with the weird formula.  The fact is its been so long since a kh game came out that fans wanted it to be better than possible and they forgot what the game is even like.  Ff games still come out all the time and square has a lot of experience working with them and I'm sure they learned a lot of valuable lessons from kh3 and ff15 on how to correct fans expectations which I think they have done an amazing job lately listening to fans and the square Enix show at E3 was 10x better then anything else at the convention this year displaying just how on top of their game Square is atm.   Bringing back crystal chronicles and making the ff12 remake is proof that they know what long term fans are looking for and they are nailing it.
nintendo,eqxwa8j,t1_eqxw7mm,1560374645.0,They basically screwed their own online experience by not including the port
nintendo,eqxw7mm,t3_bzpvxr,1560374622.0,A dock like this should be standard. I will be very upset if the new switch models don't come with a better dock. It shouldn't only have a better shape but also expanded functionality. Built in Lan port should be standard with the way Nintendo online works.  Yeah I can buy the lan adapter but then I go smash online and the other people don't have one so I suffer from their poor person lag... This would be much better had the dock came with a lan port
FinalFantasy,eqxuy7d,t1_eqxuk5u,1560374219.0,Final Fantasy x even had part 2. They been doing this a while but not for every game.  12 was fine 15 was fine but maybe had a few dlc.  I think their decision has to do with fans expecting a lot of of 7 and trying to make them happy by taking the time to develop the game as well as possible which means more time to perfect one of their most beloved games
FinalFantasy,eqxuk5u,t1_eqxkbvw,1560374093.0,Oh you mean like final fantasy 13 parts 1 2 and 3?   Lmao.  If they are all full length and fun games then I kind of agree with it because I think final fantasy 7 deserves to be 3x longer. Much like getting hyped for a new star wars trilogy. I'm not sad that they didn't condense the trilogy into one movie just because it would make me only have to buy one movie ticket
FinalFantasy,eqxsyaz,t1_equgvye,1560373558.0,They know how it's going to be received. They have intentionally spent the time to do it right and their modern games show that they are in tune with listening and updating to modern times.  FF7 will have both action combat and strategic turn based button to pause gameplay so whether you're a fan of ff15 action combat or classic turn based this game is going to be for you.  FF7 had an amazing story so building on that will be very easy for them.  The reason it's going to be in installments is because they are already that confident that they are going to be milking this game
FinalFantasy,eqxsgb0,t3_bzo7bs,1560373387.0,The final fantasy 7 remake taking so long that the final fantasy 8 remake going to beat it out the gates lol
truegaming,eqxrzax,t3_bzpsel,1560373220.0,"This is a tough one because let's say there are 5 ways to play the game equally as rewarding. Now you don't feel as rewarded for finding the one best way to play and feeling superior in your gameplay. Essentially you just play however you want and this leads to the feeling of why try to figure the game out at all I'll just do random stuff and beat the game just as good as some guy who's 3x the gamer I am.  Although balance is important there should always be a ""best"" way to play the game but it should be less obvious and come through learning the game over the course of its first play through so your second ng+ makes you feel like you learned what the game is about and became the master of the best way to play it which you'll do on your ng+ playthrough gleefully"
GameDeals,eqxlw4v,t1_eqtgdlb,1560371150.0,"Who the fuck hates it?? It got game of the year is got a second game incoming, I mean it's a bit different than past games but still a huge leap forward in tons of ways.
