You see, if you allow anxiety to continue taking your peace, joy, and freedom from you, it will continue doing so until you are totally defeated. Stand up, put yourself together, refuse to be defeated and you will see that slowly but surely you will begin to enjoy your freedom again.http://myenxietyfreelife.com/"
Anxiety,etyx757,t1_etyv0yn,1563323952.0,"Yes, you are right. But know that what you feel in the body is the results of what started in your mind. That's why trying to treat anxiety with drugs will not help get rid of it, but only cope with it. But is you can deal with it in your mind and free yourself from it, your body will automatically be free as well. My point is that it is possible to live anxiety-free."
Anxiety,etx8595,t3_cdw8mn,1563293663.0,"Hi there. It's good that you took courage to talk about it. I want to tell you about my teen son. My son is a very clever and talented boy, but doesn't see that.  He very much concerned with what people think of him, what they say about him, how they see him. He pays so much attention to what other people say about him that start to lose his self-esteem. He has now created this conviction in his head that friend don't need him because he is not good enough. He struggled with that for a while, thank God i was there for him. Couple of things i always tell him are:

1. Know yourself well, don't learn about yourself from other people
2. No-one is perfect. Even the best among many has his or her own imperfections
3. Everyone is unique, and somehow has what other people don't and will never have
4. Never try to be who you are not just because you want people to like you
5. If friends don't want to be with you, don't force them to
6. If we really need friends, we must understand that friends are those willingly want to be with us for who we are,and not for what we are
7. Never give people the power to decide about your peace and happiness, let it be in your own hands
8. Not everyone will appreciate you and your good efforts, but allow not your heart to discourage
9.  Make a decision to always be the best you can be, because you have the potential
10. Decide that nothing will take your peace and joy away.

I hope this helps. I am not a fun of taking drugs for anxiety, depression and so on. I know that the problem is in the mind, which drugs will never cure. i believe that one can get rid of this problem once and for all with the right understanding.

AskReddit,etvihzr,t3_cavz78,1563236283.0,"Anxiety is caused by a lot of different thing, but i always consider fear as the ultimate cause. Almost everyone living with anxiety experiences fear of something. It can be fear of loving a loved one, fear of losing a job. fear of the future, fear of failing, in short, fear of losing. Fear is a big destroyer."
