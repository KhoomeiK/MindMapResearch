careerchange,fnx57if,t3_g48uwc,1587331707.0,"I‘m a relatively successful graphic/motion designer, working in the industry since 8 years but am actually thinking about advancing to basic web development. As the person before me said, design business is slowly dying, as the internet makes cheap international freelancers or diy-logo-design-automators so accessible. I do get lots of job requests for web shop developments, small website set ups etc. and can‘t take on the jobs because i have no skills in programming.
does anyone know if there are online courses i could take?"

We were supposed to fly to Japan right after for our 4 week honeymoon, but the flights got cancelled today. Vendors are cancelling on me. I‘m heartbroken. 

I know things could be worse. But i‘m mourning. :("

careerchange,fgle15k,t1_fgl8pwl,1580892921.0,"I do understand it though. This made me think a lot last night. I mean, my advice might be ‘the right way’, but the thing is - I’m a creative director and feel like you a lot of times too. i usually switched jobs every 1-3 years, i get too fustrated or overwhelmed with projects or clients...
i did go freelance and moved away for a while which did help. but sometimes me and my husband do dream about a bold career change. like opening a toy store :)."
careerchange,fgjvuqg,t3_eysizz,1580852390.0,"it’s not the career. it’s the surroundings. i love the idea of just switching things up. you can still code, but maybe for a completely different sector. my brother switched from coding websites to coding software codes for the airforce. coding in another country or sector could, or even moving to another country or town and trying new stuff and a new team will make so much difference. no need for full career change. ps: im not a coder."

Anxiety,fcafuxu,t1_fcafbrb,1577568511.0,It can be super scary if you don‘t know what it is. Some people even rush to the emergency room because they think they‘re dying. Good thing is: a panic attack is harmless. but it‘s awful.
Anxiety,fcaffev,t3_egtemi,1577568312.0,I try acting! Pretend you‘re in a drama class and actually just acting out the role or someone that is confident and cool and good with words. It helps me a lot! In time it doesnt feel like acting anymore :) I do feel super exhausted then i‘m back in the hotel room.
Anxiety,fcaf033,t3_egsjb0,1577568097.0,"hey! i can list my panic attack list, with general anxiety its the same but everything is less ‚extreme’ but lasts longer:
tingling in hand and feet,
sweating,
a feeling of cold fire dropping through my body from head to toe,
nausea,
diarrhea,
rushing thoughts and fears,
breathing problems,
crying ,
then it ends in extreme body shaking,"

Anxiety,fcadiml,t3_egqxak,1577567374.0,"I used to have this too, constantly. Even when I woke up there was this 2-3 second calmness that then got flooded with that anxiety butterfly feeling. This was only in my worst times, and felt that it got easier and less and less the more i dealt with anxiety through therapy or talking to close people"
Advice,fc8baea,t3_egjzh0,1577531036.0,"This was me last February. I decided to just go and be honest with the guys. I called them up for an appointment to show me the gym and show me some basic things to start with. I told the fitness guy ‚look i‘ve never even seen the inside of a gym and i‘m the most unathletic person‘. They were super kind and didn‘t laugh at me - they even encouraged me and thought it was great for me to want to change things! Get a gym that makes monthly training plans, so you can learn new equipment and work towards goals! You can do this :)!!"

Anxiety and/or depression is an illness, some of us find working full time very stressfull and mentally too draining and depressing. I‘m in a better place now and don‘t feel as exhausted anymore from working, but I get you. Hope you find your way. Take care of your mental health and still keep growing my friend!"
family,fc2cniz,t1_fc1dw6n,1577352358.0,youngest Child! With a mother that has a kind of jealousy about my life. I sometimes feel like her sadness over her missed chances and wrong decisions (awful marriage to my dad etc.) turned into anger and jealousy over the years. Now its almost like I can‘t tell her about my successes because she will measure them with her own and get fustrated. But it‘s not my job to make her happy. All i can do is just listen. And hope that one day she might go to therapy herself to deal with her life.

Anxiety,f82st03,t3_dypoug,1574197523.0,"I used to have them for phases at a time. Exactly like you describe it, even at night I would wake up and have them.  Any small anxiety thought or memory would make them appear. 
What helped me was when I went to the doc to get my anti depressants prescription he asked how I was doing. I said okayish same same every day but I feel a general anxiety throughout the day that comes and goes in mini attacks.  Just telling him I‘ve been having that issue took away its power and made them ease away. 
So every time I do get them (maybe for a a day or two at a time) I just tell my doc or husband and describe my physical and psychological feelings in great detail. 
They react so calm and relaxed about it like ‚yeah that‘ll pass‘ that it immediately relaxes me too."
