There exists a person today who has major issues with the establishment, whom constantly champions people rights that keeps bowing to that very same establishment, who has thrown in their towel on multiple occasions to back a war criminal/ thief and one handsy old man  with alzheimer's.

We stood behind that person because we thought they were different... I will not back the party where progress goes to  die. Congrats you've moved me even further left. For that alone I should thank you.

Vote third party ladies and gentlemen, unseat incumbents... pay attention to the down ballot and leave the overarching political theater behind.
