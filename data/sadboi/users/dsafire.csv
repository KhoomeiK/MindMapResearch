And me begging for more Talk therapy. I want Psycho-dynamic therapy. I dont want more coping mechanisms, i want to \*fix whats in my fucking head!\* I want to deal with the memories once and for all.  


And he told me bluntly that id never get it. My options were an online support group for depression sufferers generally or an online group for learning CBT.  Im a shut-in immigrant in S.Ontario with trust issues for days because i was Raised by Narcissists, group is never going to cut it.  


I dont think im even waitlisted anymore. I worry the next time I lose control, the Spouse wont be fast enough. At least ive got my wellies, even if they dont work so good these days.   


At least its better than in NYC, where I called nine Psychiatrists and was refused by nine receptionists because I had an HMO they didnt like.   


Except there still no help, so maybe not. Not for this.   


A girl in Toronto is getting help. She had to write a book though.  


Im going to kill myself eventually, just by losing control and dumb luck. I hope Canadians like the money they saved on not treating me."
