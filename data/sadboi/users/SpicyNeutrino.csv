It's definitely my passion and I try to devote as much of my life as I can to it. That being said, my dedication to my major has led to no days off and a ton of loneliness. Making your life about an academic endeavor doesn't make you very fun at parties. 

That being said, no matter how hard you work or how good you are, there will always be people that outshine you. When someone I know is far ahead of me, it helps me to just tell myself that I'm not there *yet*. I know for a fact that I've come a long way so it helps to reflect on that."

college,fp2oewj,t3_gayxdh,1588265203.0,"Not gonna lie, if you're at a big research university, there's a good chance any complaint would go nowhere unless it's a really big deal. These professors probably get complaints from failing students every term, especially if they grade harshy and don't try too hard to interact with the students.

I think your best chance would be to talk to the university about allowing you to drop or change the grading or something on the grounds that the transition to online was the underlying cause rather than the professor. Most universities have already been implementing policies because the transition to online causes so many problems for students and professors."
math,foxgnam,t1_fowaeqr,1588143410.0,"I think most of those who want to push those boundaries choose to endure the bad part of their work because they find it fulfilling in itself. There are plenty of happy mathematicians out there along with communities that find their abstract work important. 

In my opinion, the loneliness and depression associated with grad students has more to do with the conditions grad students are often put into nowadays than the subjects they study.

I do agree that it's concerning that modern math/physics has become more and more specialized over time though. On the other hand, it's kind of amazing that there are so many distinct and important mathematical topics out there that people are learning more about."

Research can be a proof of some unproven conjecture, an improvement on some bound, or any other kind of original mathematical work. This is not easy though so any published paper would be quite an accomplishment. 

As for the relevance, it's hard to assess without familiarity with the modern research in the area you want to work in. This is another reason an experienced guide would be very helpful. I recommend talking to your professors. Good luck in your research!"

[-2,2]) is 0.
