EatingDisorders,f6mvue1,t3_drsdyl,1572979996.0,"An eating disorder is more mental than physical. Maybe it could be just anxiety in general that is making you feel this way but all I know is, my eating disorder makes me hate my bodily image. I desire so badly to look and be skinny that I restrict and fast all the time. It's purely because of the way I look that I have slowly taught myself to be afraid of food/gaining weight, and as a result restrict as much as possible.

I do not believe that you have an eating disorder due to the way you have described your mental state. However, this habit of not eating due to fear of throwing up or feeling sick could lead to an eating disorder. 

I do recommend though to maybe eat small portions throughout the day, in order to reduce this feeling of nausea. So maybe eat something very small every 1/2 hours of the day. They recommend this eating pattern for people who have G.E.R.D/G.O.R.D (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease), in which I have. As it greatly reduces the feeling of nausea."
