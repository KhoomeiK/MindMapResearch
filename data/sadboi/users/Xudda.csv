Competitiveoverwatch,fqao5r9,t3_ghmi1p,1589222385.0,"> So maybe people got better at countering Genji? This is true, but also Genji players have gotten better, so **it's impossible to say it is just due to player skill increasing**.

In all honesty, I'm not sure that this logic really holds true, even if it makes sense initially. Genji is a hero who requires a lot of mechanical skill in order to see any significant returns from his tools, but he's also a hero who doesn't do a whole lot when he isn't able to operate ""under the radar"" in a sense. Genji more or less relies on his opponents to not see him coming. He's sort of like a cat, he's an ambush and opportunistic predator. If you asked me, I'd say that Genji's skill ceiling was being encroached *years* ago, and that he was more or less mastered in the first year of the game.

That being said, you are right in that people have become more adept at countering him and being mindful/aware of how he plays and what he's trying to do. He's trying to farm blade and pick off enemies from open sight lines positioned off to the side or the backline. Regardless of how skilled a Genji player is *mechanically*, his returns in the neutral game are greatly limited by the awareness and counter-measures of his opponents. If he can't play his game of cat and mouse during the neutral game, due to the mouse becoming more responsive and aware, his efficacy drops substantially. It doesn't per se matter how mechanically gifted a genji player is, if his opponents know what he's trying to do already.

In the early days of OW. people's understanding and overall gist of the game were not as developed, so Genji players could operate with an air of mystique about them. That's now gone, and so long as his opponents are able to avoid his neutral game, he's reduced to an ult bot. 

His ult is still decent, and it's still fairly potent when boosted by nano, but that's a lot to invest in a combo that doesn't guarantee returns. 

I think it's honestly an issue of genji lacking the burst damage to accomplish anything. If I were in charge of buffing genji,the first thing I would do is look at his crit multiplier and his projectile speed (and/or rate of fire) and consider allowing him to do more in the neutral game by getting a better return out of headshotting with shurikens. I'd also be very interested in giving him a 4 or 5 shuriken burst as opposed to 3, buffing his shurkin travel speed, and a slight decrease to overall shuriken damage so that his DPS goes up a bit, and his right click becomes much more potent, but it doesn't per se skyrocket. In this solution, the rewards scale with player skill and aim. If that is either not a sufficient course of action, or it's OP, I'd then think about giving him natural armor. Thirdly, I'd strongly reconsider giving him his triple jump and ledge boost back, as well as possibly buffing his movement speed. 

Hell, I'd even consider giving him back his original ult duration, but this would be my least favorite solution, as he's already an ult bot and this would do very little to help that.

That's just my two cents. Genji suffers due to a combination of having a weak neutral game and an ult that requires both time and a lot of team investment, and the best way to increase his viability is to boost him in the neutral game. If anyone needs a reminder of what  the neutral game is, it's also been called the ""poke phase"" of the game, or essentially any point in time where neither team is hard committing to a fight or using ults. His ability to operate in this phase of the match has been neutered by both sustain creep and player skill rising. He needs more tools to be effective in the neutral game and I honestly think looking at giving him more DPS is the only way to go.

I know we tend to look for solutions that avoid creep of any kind but tbh I think that ship has sailed. I don't see that being an option anymore. It sucks to say that, but I'm a day one player with almost two thousand hours under my belt and my heartfelt/genuine opinion is that avoiding creep is no longer an option. Rather, we ought to look at continuing to evolve the game and drop the ""creep"" weights from our ankles, as it's a disingenuous idea and concept at this point in time."

Of course, the two aren't mutually exclusive and can overlap, but they aren't one and the same. He needs a professional. Many people with bipolar are able to cope without medication (if they have the proper support from loved ones). Bipolar is a label for a wide spectrum of symptoms. Some people will alternate between phases on a daily basis and others will do so over the course of days or weeks. And not all bipolar diagnoses have psychotic features. Antipsychotics aren't a go-to for bipolar. It's a tough diagnosis. But ofc it takes a professional in a 1 on 1 to get at what's really going on. I've found in my experience with bipolar that many people who have it (provided they don't have psychosis and don't have violent or self harmful tendencies) prefer not to take medication to cope. Many psychiatric meds have unpleasant side-effects and also have a tendency to mute a person with bipolar's feelings which many of them find undesirable. It's better to have mindfulness and therapy and, more importantly than anything (in my honest opinion) proper support from friends/family/spouse which it seems the man is not getting. A very patient and understanding partner goes a loooong way for people with bipolar. 

And I hope I didn't come off as criticizing. I suppose I rant on this subject more than most because both my SO and my own mother have bipolar disorder and I have a lot of experience dealing with it and supporting people who suffer from it. I know how hard it can be."
