LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fjmgtm3,t1_fjmei2v,1583470218.0,"I think he was just uncomfortable being there in general, especially when Amber would speak because I’m sure Amber spoke to him about telling Jessica off in depth once she watched the show haha"
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fjmgmk7,t1_fjm4fik,1583470064.0,Agreed. I’m pretty sure they watched she show the same time as us which means Amber just found out about the extent to which Jessica was crushing in Barnett. We k is she had an inkling but she probably didn’t know as much. And Jessica wouldn’t bring it up (even if she remembered half of it anyway). So I understand why Amber was so upset.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fjmg00r,t1_fjm3jsb,1583469570.0,"I think Jessica is just mortified at her actions on the show. I bet the filming felt like a whirlwind. As she got to see how she acted in the pods, so did everyone else. Honestly I feel like she forgot about the cameras when she was drunk. Hindsight is 2020."

LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fija15t,t1_fiiml3w,1582439271.0,I both hate and love that it's been a year and a half because it's given those that have married a fair amount of time to see if it will all work out... all without the public interfering.
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fig8cmp,t1_fif8k78,1582397074.0,"I agree, I also didn't even read it as him understanding her politics, just that he understood her family's situation and would help."
LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fig42d1,t1_fifzoet,1582395921.0,The crazier part is that I read an esquire article where they were interviewing Mark and he said that they never spent as much time together as the other couples because Jessica would just stay at her own house (which was close by) or would be traveling for work. She'd only go to the filming apartment to meet up with him once in a while.  SO MANY RED FLAGSSSS.
BeautyGuruChatter,fi85br2,t1_fi83t98,1582233740.0,sounds like they should be looking internally.
bathandbodyworks,fhbpje0,t3_f289za,1581447139.0,I bought it and thought I could handle it on cold sniff. But once I burned it all I could smell was cherry medicine and I promptly returned it.
TheCircleTV,ffdclca,t3_et0f27,1579818025.0,"To be fair a catfish is just anyone who portrays themself as someone they are not. It doesn’t have to be pictures of someone that is more conventionally attractive, though that is a popular choice when catfishing.  The UK version did a better job at representing different ways people can catfish."
BeautyGuruChatter,fc09wtb,t1_fc08ftg,1577284403.0,"Please take this with a grain of salt as I do not personally have the palette, but I have seen a fair amount of reviews. 

From what I’ve read/seen, Tati’s glitters kind of get all over, especially if you aren’t using a good glitter glue. In regards to the glitters in the sequin shadows, they tend to not show if you do any blending at all, so if you want to see those glitters you have to pack those shades on. Furthermore, I’ve gathered that the shimmers aren’t super reflective which could be a pro or con depending on your taste. The mattes were universally liked by the reviews I watched and the black was especially pigmented and dark."
AskReddit,fc01775,t1_fc00xil,1577273167.0,Same goes for NYC. Certain boroughs or even areas of boroughs have no or very limited public transportation access.

AskReddit,fc012le,t1_fbzoum2,1577272950.0,That’s not true everywhere. In NYC you aren’t allowed to turn right on red unless there is a sign specifically saying that you can (which is rare).

quityourbullshit,fb81ndh,t1_fb80iw6,1576604184.0,Of course. They have to keep the pressure up for the viewers. It wouldn’t be as compelling of a watch without that feeling of secondhand anxiety for the chefs.
thesims,fb5ien3,t3_ebjmis,1576528221.0,Top right is less restrictive to a certain style but I’m loving the top left
BeautyGuruChatter,fb2rpr4,t1_fb2cwx9,1576456481.0,I agree. The shape was pretty weird and it was a super dark look. You can barely even see the lashes on top and the darkness on the lower lash line seemed too low. I think a cat eye shape would’ve been more flattering. but also she hadnt started out with that look in mind. She wasn’t expecting tati’s black to be so pigmented and decided to go with it.
bathandbodyworks,fb2pqg0,t3_eb3iwr,1576455427.0,"Okay it’s not just me then, lol. I see people talk about scents they like and whatnot and combine that with the sales/coupons... omg. I have more candles than I need right now lol."

BeautyGuruChatter,f9vte91,t1_f9vsvlc,1575679244.0,"When people bought the mystery boxes the description said ""every box contains at least 1 exclusive **cosmetic** item."" Stickers are not a cosmetic item. So no, the consumers are not the dumb ones here. They literally did not get what they paid for.

Luckily for those who bought the box and were disappointed, J\* is refunding the boxes because they acknowledged that the wording did not reflect the actual contents of the box."
BeautyGuruChatter,f9vlz88,t1_f9un72b,1575673740.0,"The crazy part is that no one said the stickers suck. People are just surprised that in a beauty makeup box, stickers would count as an item. If it was an art box, sure. But a makeup and merch brand? It’s out of place."
thesims,f8wufte,t1_f8wassr,1574900233.0,Yessss. Whenever my game crashes it’s usually during a stupid loading screen so now I ALWAYS save before any loading screen lol.
BeautyGuruChatter,f8v31mx,t1_f8uzzvp,1574857548.0,I thought so too. But then again maybe the did film things like that and then decided to cut it. Who knows. The way Marlena spoke about the episode I certainly thought she’d be more involved.

BeautyGuruChatter,f8c7f5l,t1_f8c74s8,1574454189.0,Pretty much. Most people will never see the inside of a private jet so it gets attention as well as shows off how “rich” they are
ShaneDawson,f8c3iuu,t1_f8c1x7c,1574451600.0,"Shane is making significantly more than the majority of people in the world. He is not poor. 

Is he less rich than some other youtubers, sure. But those other youtubers put in a lot more of a daily grind to get that extra income. For the most part Shane has been lazy about all the avenues that many other youtubers have taken advantage of to increase their income - merch, sponsorships, collabs with brands, following trends, Instagram, Snapchat, hardcore advertising across platforms, etc."

PublicFreakout,f8ava3t,t1_f8agfay,1574413770.0,Yeah she really came out of left field with the rant. This is 100% one of those  it’s only an insult if you take it as one situations. “Ok boomer” is as effective of an insult as “okay brunette.” Clearly she has some issues she needs to work out.
WatchPeopleDieInside,f8av4pt,t1_f8aqv0j,1574413543.0,I think the issue is that it looks like a partly rendered game object. So your mind expects more details to render and then when that don’t you’re just like?? Wait that’s it?

BeautyGuruChatter,f7owmo7,t1_f7oknng,1573936189.0,"Agreed. You criticize a persons actions, not their being. And lord knows Jaclyn has made a lot of shitty decisions. No need to come for her looks."

ShaneDawson,f776man,t3_duiqmc,1573445457.0,This would have been a lot more wearable if they just removed the pigs. The omg at the bottom is fine and still screams Shane but the pig pattern really limits it to a very niche group of people.

Yes, there are residential lots. One even has an old couple and their grandson"
BeautyGuruChatter,f6upsop,t1_f6uh3il,1573166252.0,I think the reason people are buying is because it’s a relatively safe collab. People Who like Jeffree’s products know it’s quality so really all Shane is doing is choosing colors/packaging. Now if Shane had to create eyeshadow formulas himself and didn’t have the input of someone who is knowledgeable in that realm my eyebrows would be much more raised.
BeautyGuruChatter,f6tzgow,t1_f6tt3ad,1573156118.0,Yeah I noticed more highlight from concealer overall in the second one. The before looks flat in comparison
ShaneDawson,f6m85ig,t1_f6ki1m8,1572968200.0,My order from beautylish has said I had to wait week up until the carrier actually received the item and it went from a week to one day so I’m guessing the same will happen for yours
