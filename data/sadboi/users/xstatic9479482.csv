What do you expect ""doctors"" to say when their jobs are at risk for speaking against trannies?

They don't give a fuck how their actions affect other people as long as their feelings are validated even if they have to make up shit about someone molesting his own daughter to get him to step down. The DSM-5 guideline this is based off of is the only DSM guideline done in private and not peer reviewed (or voted on?). The guidelines regarding treatment were not from a medical professional or scientist, they were written by a trans activist and much of the terminology was taken from the guidelines for dealing with autistic people. Transgender billionaires have collectively spent $500mil+ to make sure their feelings are validated. It's funny you mention antivax because this transgender bullshit will (hopefully) be liked at as just as retarded as antivax and flat earthers 50 years from now. You're seriously trying to argue that men can become women and vice versa while being a smug cunt about it. They're not and will never be biologically indistinguishable from what they deliriously think they are and the surgeries have disgusting results that only someone who has never seen a vagina before would actually believe is passable as one.
