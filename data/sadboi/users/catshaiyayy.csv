It was raining out and she decided to chase me. She slipped on a puddle and broke her wrist. I found her screaming in pain and tried to help her walk back to the house since we were pretty close, and she was refusing to lean on me. She fell again, the second time she fell on her face and her lip split open. We went to the hospital and it was really a horrible experience. She is convinced that the doctor sowed up her lip wrong, and that me and my stepdad told the doctor to do it. But primarily me, because she was convinced I wanted her to be ‚Äúugly‚Äù for the rest of her life. Her lips look absolutely fine and the same to me, and I have really pretty full lips just like her. For years after she would not stop comparing how our mouths looked, and would go into a screaming rage about how I wanted her to be ugly because I was jealous of her, or that my stepdad never wanted her to get attention from other men again. To this day, 10 years later, she brings it up, which is one of the many reasons her number is blocked. I was a kid! I wasn‚Äôt even capable of being that sadistic, but she needed to find someone to blame and terrorize over her insecurities since she couldn‚Äôt do so with the doctor who sowed up her lip."
Coronavirus,fo0lwe4,t1_fo0kbtw,1587415483.0,"I don‚Äôt think privilege has anything to do with it. I think valuing saving human lives by trying to control the virus through social distancing has everything to do with it. People protesting care more for their individual happiness than promoting health and wellbeing of others, especially our elderly and immunocompromised members of the community. 

If working to pay bills and feed mouths is the argument, why don‚Äôt they go get a job at the grocery store? like I did when I lost my job, so I could continue paying rent and feeding myself. And my coworker who was a hairdresser and got a job cashiering. A lot of grocery stores are hiring, due to autoimmune employees being afraid to get sick, or infecting their older parents, or dying from covid-19 themselves. So if the virus isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthat bad‚Äù, if they are concerned about paying bills, why don‚Äôt they just go work at a grocery store???"
