depression,eqgk672,t3_by732p,1560037669.0,"I empathise with you here. We may have a ""good"" life but at the end of the day it doesn't matter how privileged we are or how down on our luck we are. 
Our brains work in crazy ways, our emotions, irrational thoughts, and insecurities override any good going on and that's OK. Don't feel guilty for what you can't control, because you can't control that you have depression.
You CAN be kind to yourself and seek the help and support you need.
Wishing you all the best!"
confession,eqdztut,t3_by6w9y,1559997375.0,"The prevelance of depression is really high, 300 million people world wide have depression.

Teenagers are silly but they also have a fricken crazy amount of hormonal changes going on. Sometimes that attention seeking bs is actually a cry for help.
If she hasn't been diagnosed with depression by a professional then maybe suggest she does because if she has depression then she will need to see someone about it. That way if she is full of ot you can kinda be like ""if you really had depression then....""
Be cautious though. Good luck!!"
