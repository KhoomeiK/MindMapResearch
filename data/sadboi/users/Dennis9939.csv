For me personally, the notion of ""work or die"" is where I have an issue.

It's pretty juvenile to suggest that folks just want to sit around all day, obviously, humans aren't like that. People want to work, but they want to do the things they are interested in, or find meaning in.

Many people are stuck in a situation where they cannot get an education due to money. Many people get depressed and remain stuck in their job, having neither the time or energy to look for something that fulfills them.

And that is why we need an universal minimal income, in case of unemployment.  
So people can still eat and clothe themselves while going in the direction they desire.

Which is more than realistic, and has been shown in many experiments to work very effectively, vastly increasing people's productivity and motivation and sense of community.  
And it would save huge amounts of money due to the countless negative consequences the current system has on people. Crime, drug abuse, anti depressants and so on.

And yes, there will still be people who clean the streets, because there are people who don't care about having a career and who find enjoyment in picking up soda cans with that fancy stick.

Their flawlesss costumes which looked like they never seen a battlefield or even a puddle, and the dialogue that felt forced and unnatural. Like when Geralt explained why he'd rather not choose between evil or lesser evil. I think that scene was just plain bad.   


The confusing timeline which is never explained, paired with that weird racial mix that doesn't make any sense at all, since it's supposed to be in Poland.  


Imagine the show Vikings had a chinese Ragnar Lothbrok. I know the WItcher universe is fictional, but if you were to have a fictional laser Space Nazi movie, I think you'd still not to cast a black or asian or indian space hitler, if you know what I'm saying, you'd cast a German.

And to top it off, the ""empower wimin"" deal.   
The books are heavily centered around Geralt. The show is 50% Yennefer, and 50% the rest of the cast (WIth Geralt included) Honestly, they should rename the show Yennefer all together.

Compared to shows like Game of thrones or Vikings, the Witcher doesn't even come remotely close in terms of quality.
