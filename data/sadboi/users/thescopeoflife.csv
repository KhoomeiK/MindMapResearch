You have to learn to live without it. Everything is learnt from scratch and you won't have someone telling you how reality is. You will have to look for the truth on your own. Not knowing who to trust. Often not having true support. And the worst about it all, there were tiny little moments that were good about being there, and sometimes you ask yourself was the struggle of leaving worth it? Maybe staying in denial wasn't right, but it was more comfortable.

At least that's how it was/is with me."

These people will take any possibility for education about the world and turn it into another ""sunday school"". And they will always do it in an unconvincing and dull way because they count on people being indoctrinated from the early age so if it's the only narrative they hear, they may just go with it, right?
