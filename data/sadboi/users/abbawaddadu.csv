Don't end up spending way too much on ads if you are giving a sub-par product. People find out. Don't take up more debt than absolutely necessary. Use online advertising ONLY if you really trust your products and your test group likes it. I personally don't like those people who ask their friends to review their business with 5 stars on a portal. It's like asking someone to like their fb posts.

As for India. Understand the paperwork is going to be hell. Try to get a good CA and a good Lawyer. PLEASE PLEASE GET MOST OF YOUR LEGALS SORTED. Many many times municipalities will just think you are breaking some law and with a strong legal backing, you will have a better chance to fight back.

IPR doesn't really get implemented here so if your product have something that is very difficult for someone to do perfectly try to work with it.  Understand that mentors will help you but not so much you start eating their share of the pie. Spend a ton of time to decide if your B plan actually works in India. Don't be one of those countless startups that copies an idea from silicon valley only to realise it doesn't work with India. If you are a B2B guy, most likely you have to find way to reduce price and if you are a B2C person you have to drive value.

If you are planning to make a physical product PLEASE ensure your logistics isn't ripping you off. I'm not taking names but my family business had worked with a massive international logistics firm here, and occasionally you had to transfer some money to the poor delivery guys because the warehouses were actually built on land that was not theirs and they had to bride the locals. Also quite frequently our goods used to get stolen from a lot. No one cares how the product is transferred as long as it is in one piece.

Pro tips
Buy boxing tape with your company name and number on it customised on it. It is not that expensive and is really effective in making robbers think twice. 

Also learn how to make professional invoices over Excel for large orders. If you are having a ton of POs then investing in a software like Tally makes more sense, however right now it's not quite likely you might get a large nos of POs.

It wouldn't hurt if you can make amazing content on your socials. Try out Canva and other online resources. It's not perfect but it's good enough to start with.

Best of luck"

The problems is not with too many people or too few resources but the problem is with supply chains and economic conditions. It's not a coincidence that the poorest of the poor are those who are migrants. Supply chains currently aren't feasible in a country that hasn't really invested in its ration infrastructure.

india,fqedk1q,t1_fqeac6w,1589305784.0,"We don't really want to be in a stagflation situation. That's when you have increased the amount of money but demand really doesn't pick up. As per all known methods of economics, nothing can really say for certain if demand will go up. You could tweak supply but demand is as much psychological as it is mathematical. We could produce more and more cars and crash the prices down, but there is no real certainty it would increase demand for cars. People after a pandemic like this may want to save money. A lot of them are still traumatized by Demonetization. 

Savings for a personal finance perspective is great but for Keynesian models of Economics, it is something that should be avoided. That savings could go into buying more stuff and that could be used to make more stuff and so on. Now I understand the logic, but I'm not going to liquidate my accounts on a whim of a theory because it's not practical. 

There is nothing inherently wrong with printing money. But print too much money and you are stuck with hyper inflation. Print enough money but with no growth you get stagflation. Have high growth but high inflation, you are basically at the same postion. Also imagine if you have saved money all your life but because of inflation and the general depreciation of currency that comes with it, your real savings are worth less than what it could have been. It could be significantly less. Basically inflation is a tax on the people who were financially ""prudent"" in order to bail those out who weren't. And it's also a big political no no. 

As for corona bonds. If it's in any way how the corona bonds in EU are then there is some issues. So basically they are debt instruments (like a loan of sorts)issued by governments to finance projects. As you know government projects are plagued with petty politics, inefficient execution and just overblown budgets. Although they could offer higher returns, most investors would prefer sovereign bonds or gold bonds as a riskles asset. Also a ton of blue chips are now at ridiculously low prices. As a long investor I will definitely buy the value bluechips. But I guess this is a matter where money dictates action rather than returns and it's an issue above returns.
