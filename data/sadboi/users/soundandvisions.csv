Sobriety is freaking hard. It’s also so, so, so much better. I look at people who are much older than me who have had drug problems their entire lives, and it makes me feel very fortunate that I decided to pursue sobriety at my age (started trying to sober up before I turned 21, I’ve had relapses and attempts since then but I’m 23 now and have only slipped up once in nearly a year). 

Think about your future. Think about being 50 years old with a lifetime of drug abuse and addiction. Think about all of the opportunities you could miss out on and the relationships you would harm. The thing about addiction is that it becomes a priority in life. Over love, over friendships, over family, over education, over career, over hobbies, over travel, over LIVING.
