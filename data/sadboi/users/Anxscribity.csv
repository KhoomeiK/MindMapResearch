introvert,exl2sso,t3_cthkq6,1566404736.0,"Some people need distractions because they don't like being alone with their thoughts. Quietness/calmness/silence forces them to think/feel things that they don't like or don't want to deal with.

I feel like the extroverts that don't pressure me, understand that I'm an introvert, and let me be myself without judgement - they are comfortable with themselves.

The extroverts that get upset with you for not being like them, they are the ones who need distractions from themselves. They are essentially trying to force other people to be their coping mechanisms. When you don't fill that role for them, they get upset.

There are also those that don't understand introvertedness. They think you are lonely and sad and they are trying to help, albeit misguided."

introvert,ewnhlhs,t3_cp0v2f,1565578451.0,"Some people (extroverts, usually) always think that they have to help introverts to be social. As if being an introvert makes us sad or lonely (something they experience with solitude). 

Just explain to your ""friends"" that you aren't trying to become more social. You are happy the way to are. Would they appreciate if you forced them to sit and be alone all day just because that's what you yourself prefer?

And let them know that you don't like dancing. You don't find it enjoyable. Tell them about the things you do like, and why you like them. If they see you have passion for other things, they won't worry about you being lonely. 

If they can't respect your individually, then don't hang out with them as much."

CasualConversation,etn1kk4,t3_ccaqgp,1562974183.0,"At 3 we were told my son had severe autism, would never ""graduate"" out of a special needs class, would never get a job, and would never understand the world around him. I was furious. 

Whether or not someone has a disability, it is damaging, disrespectful, and completely unethical (in my opinion) to start putting limitations on a person - especially a 3 years old. There is no way anyone can say they know for certain what someone is capable of. I'm still pissed about it. 

Anyway, my son ""graduated"" out of his special needs preschool in his second year of attendance. Oh, and at his evaluation to move to the state preschool, another ""expert"" told us he is not autistic. Is or isn't... I don't care. It's all about getting him what he needs to learn and grow. 

He's now getting ready to go into 4th grade. He's right on target with his academia. He is still receiving speech therapy for expressive language. He's still a bit clumsy, he's very literal, very smart, thoughtful, and loves to help people and play with friends. 

Good for your sister for not giving up on him. I often worry about the kids and parents who believe these generalizations and limitations, and therefore never try and give up hope."

Yes, vomiting sucks! I hate it so much! But if it's going to happen, I can't stop it, and that's the worst of it. Just keep drinking water bc it will make it easier. And if need be, sit on the toilet for one end and have a garbage can in front of you for the other.
