stopdrinking,fpazerg,t1_fpatxy5,1588458899.0,My drinking is definitely a problem. I have convinced myself that I can do it safely....but my hiding it is because I know that I shouldn‚Äôt and it could get bad.

Probably more common than any of us realize. Just remember that their actions are more about them than about you.

You deserve to be treated well. Period. Especially by family, but they are often the cruelest. Are you old enough and have the resources to see a therapist?  Can you talk to a parent and tell them how it is making you feel?  Can you tell them that their bullying hurts?  You need to be you own best friend and advocate and stand up for yourself. You are not stupid, ugly, and you DO matter. I hope you realize that and take some action to stop behaviors that are obviously draining you. Take care."
