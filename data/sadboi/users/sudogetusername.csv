Midsommar,fcue4wx,t3_eiw5td,1577978815.0,"I personally didn't see the imitation of emotions as a lack of compassion, but rather I took it as an extreme form of empathy. In those scenes the individuals emotions become the communities emotions. Also the pain is shared and therefore the resolution of it (the negative emotion/situation) falls on everyone not just the person inflicted. In some ways it could also be like a hivemind.

Overall I think that Dani found the workings of the community to provide her with the emotional support that she craved. Her familys death was extremely traumatizing and alienating, especially when you consider that she was so far removed from it (she didn't know what was happening, was separated from them, and couldn't share the pain that her family felt). Christian and his friends could sympathize with the situation, but not empathize. And it didn't seem like she had any other support systems. I think she wanted someone to feel her emotions and understand what she was going through."

Since high school I've been reminding myself to do it when I'm having a conversation or when I'm with people I care about, so it no longer feels like a chore with people I know but with strangers the insecurities and fear tend to pop up.

- There was one young guy who just chatted with me about music and life for the whole ride. He showed me his favorite songs and asked me mine, and just gave me advice theoughout. If felt like we were already close friends and it was probably the most comfortable Uber ride I've ever had

- Another youngish guy found out I was a software developer so he asked me if I'd like to work on an app with him. The app was basically a wingman service and connected guys in need with ""pick up artists"" who'd give them advice. Needless to say I told him that I was too busy to help. He ended up also asking me for my number, which I gave him (couldn't say no) but never contacted me

- Another man told me about how he recently moved from CO and how he missed snowboarding there. We chatted about that and his life for a while.

- One person found out I was Indian and so he put on a Hindi radio station even though I specifically told him I can't speak or understand Hindi. His car also smelled so strongly of cologne that I started getting nauseous.
