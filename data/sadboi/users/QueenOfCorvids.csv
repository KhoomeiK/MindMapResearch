Your GF is less mature than my 7yo. That's sad.

I mean, I guess if you try really hard, you could say that your comment was at the most ""insensitive"". If it makes you feel better you could give a non-apology. ""I'm sorry my saying this isn't your home upset you"". 

I'd say talk to her about her actions but she's so damn self centered she wouldn't understand why you're upset.

Keep focusing on yourself, be kind to yourself. Your worth is not based on what other people do, or what they think of you. 

When the intrusive thoughts come (and they will) tell them to fuck off and go do something good for you. Go for a run, enjoy a nice bath, sing a song you love, eat a small portion of your favorite snack, then look in the mirror and tell yourself that you love you.

RedPillWomen,fp2i8ju,t3_gaveyt,1588262204.0,"There are so many different types of ""pretty"" sweetheart.  So you're not conventionally pretty, so what? Focus on your strengths, not your perceived faults. I'm not conventionally pretty, but my BF thinks I'm gorgeous. 

Change what you can, enhance the features you like. 

You can't change your face, but you can enhance it with well groomed brows (watch all the youtube videos, find someone who looks similar to you). and make up skills (NYX is an inexpensive but decent brand to start out with).

 Learn how to accessorize and dress well for your body type. These skills will aid you your whole life. Find your style!

Focus on your body,  a well sculpted body shows you have discipline and pride in yourself, that's attractive all on it's own. 

You may not exude daintiness, that's ok you can exude power instead. Work out like a madwoman, make your core strong, define your arms and legs,  go for walks, hikes, lift small weights. 

I keep my hair short, but it's well kept, I style it daily and make sure that it shines. I use good shampoo and conditioner and keep it soft to the touch.

Start looking up skin care routines. There's more people than you'd  think that have the same type of skin you do. They'll show you what works and a lot of the time you can find inexpensive alternatives on Amazon or local stores.

Divorce,fo4q6tf,t3_g5oqor,1587509096.0,"In the beginning it was good. We met when we were very young, I was 14 he was 15. We were married at 19 and 20. 

We were a good team at the start, we both worked hard and loved each other dearly. 

My mother and brother died in a horrible accident before we were even married a year. I found out I was pregnant with our first child. Stress, grief, life was fucked. We fought, we made up. We chalked it up to stress. 

Our oldest was born. Most of the time, our life was good. We were poor af, but we loved each other. 

Our second child came, sooner than we planed but we were excited. She was born, very, very ill. More stress. She stayed in the NICU for a month, came home and passed shortly after. More tragedy, more grief. 

We fought  much more often. Horrible things were said on both sides. We did our best to get through it.  The fights started to turn physical. 

Our next child was born a year later, despite several types of birth control. 

We bought our first house. We tried so hard to be happy. Finances started to suck. Fight after fight after fight. Our relationship was so fractured and damaged. 

Fights were getting worse and worse.  I was fat, worthless, ugly. 

This is where the start of drinking problems started, because why not add to our already huge pile of problems. 

Our youngest was born. I'm not fat anymore damn it. I still had a drinking problem, fights were more common than not. I had a few broken bones here and there. He was sorry, I forgave him. 

Our youngest finally hit school age. I got a series of ok jobs. 

I finally landed a damn good job. Now the complaints were that I thought I was too good. The paranoia, accusations started to fly, the possessiveness became unbearable for me. The fights are horribly violent. 

Let's open up the marriage! Gasoline on the fire. 

Jealously on both sides. Oh the jealousy, it was awful.

He decides he doesn't want to live anymore, mixes alcohol and sedatives. In my drunken haze I decided to do the same. I black out. We had a horrifically violent fight. 

I wake up the next morning, I'm in a bathtub covered in blood. I tried to slit my wrists. My family is gone, the front door is open and I can't remember a damn thing. 

He's been arrested. I called the cops. I lost my kids for a while. They stay with my dad. I go to rehab. I don't know what the truth of night is. He says it's my fault. I beg for forgiveness. I work hard. I get through rehab. I beg my job not to fire me. 

I come home. he doesn't really care anymore. I do my best to work through issues. The marriage is still open. He lies, cheats, disappears for hours.  I'm dying on the inside. I beg, I plead. I try to be everything he wants. 

The fights keep going. Broken fingers, ribs, concussions for me. 

We go to therapy. We literally flunk out of marriage therapy. 

I'm done. It takes me a few more months the get the guts to start the process. 

We're still fighting. I'm seeing a good man, we're not serious, but he's a hell of a support. 

I finally ask my Ex to leave. It doesn't go well. He's violent. He doesn't want to get a divorce. He's nice to me, it's lies. 

I am done. We switch weeks with the kids and the house to make it easier while they're in school. 

I come home to get a few things so I can stay with my now SO. My ex is there. It's the day before Christmas Eve. My ex is pissed. He hates that I'm dating someone. We get into a physical fight. He hurt me badly. More broken fingers, horrible bruises, another concussion, in the end he's choking me and I'm scared, I think he's going to kill me. I gouge his face with my nails and run like hell. I call the cops. He goes to jail on felony charges. I am absolutely broken. 

The divorce finally goes through. The court case is pending. And it's over. 

We're selling the house and I'm still arguing with I'm about that from behind a restraining order. 

He used to be my everything, my best friend, now he's just a stranger I'm scared of."
