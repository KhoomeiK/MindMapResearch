She may be forever scared that you're about to sleep with someone else when she can't/doesn't want to anymore, and will lash out at you for it. I think you should take some time to really think about how you feel. I think she hurt you when she began prioritizing that other guy over you.

You need him to be the best father he can, for your child's sake, and I think in this case that means the decision you've made.

As for practical advice, I think you should try and get your landlord involved, he/she will not be happy about someone else living in your apartment unannounced, and has the legal authority to remove her.

I wonder if there's something in particular he's not talking about — maybe he's watching too much porn and getting unrealistic ideas of what he should be like, maybe someone said something while you two were separated, who knows. In general, I think part of this may just come from basic discomfort with his own body, and that comfort only comes with familiarity. Do you two spend time naked non-sexually? If no, then try! It may help him become comfortable with, for lack of a better word, being soft/small around you but still feeling attractive/wanted.

This man sounded completely unreasonable and overwhelmed with his own insecurities, and you weren't going to be able to make him see the errors in his actions. I'm so sorry this is how it had to end for you two, but good luck in the future, and you made the right call."

offmychest,fnsyuo5,t3_g3nwwn,1587231400.0,"Hey, kind of unrelated, but hopefully my two cents can help. Around a year ago, my mental health started going on the decline. The cumulation of an emotionally-traumatic childhood, my parents divorcing, and resurgent alcoholism in my family caused me to start losing my grip, and finally snap in a full breakdown. I'm talking weeks on end of shivering, panic, PSTD-style symptoms, days on end without sleep, the full ordeal. My girlfriend at the time tried to be supportive, but eventually she broke contact with me and told me she cared about me but couldn't do it anymore. At the time, I was furious with her, but in retrospect what she did was for the best. She was a crutch, and that was keeping me from getting better, and I needed time alone to start recovering. I still am recovering, but we've talked since and are on somewhat good terms.   


My point here is, you clearly care very much for her, and it really seems like you're trying you're best to be everything you can for her, even potentially to your own detriment. Sometimes, however, the best thing you can do for someone is to step away. You can't always carry people through everything, and sometimes you need to let people hit bottom, so that they can start getting back up again."
math,fnsn6th,t3_g380dm,1587225020.0,"Math is like philosophy if things in philosophy actually had clear, strict definitions. Philosophy can get unhelpful when debates turn into semantics about wish-washy concepts that everyone has a different conception of. Mathematics tends to avoid this by using strictly-provable theorems that stem from clearly-defined original axioms. Philosophy claims that it teaches you how to think about the world, but generally fails to. Mathematics actually does."

offmychest,fnsmq71,t3_g3oegd,1587224765.0,"Hey, I largely went through the same thing, I was super conservative and hateful in high school, and then began to realize how terrible that was as a young adult. I'm not sure how your journey went, but my anger in high school stemmed from my own insecurities, and emotional trauma I'd inherited from growing up in a broken household. I don't know if it's ever possible to ""undo"" what you said, but for me I've tried to make up for it by being honest about my transformation, owning up to what I said in high school, and being honest about where it came from, and trying to be an ally to as many people who need it as possible.

I think a lot of white men (I'm assuming you're one as well) are scared to talk about their sense of hurt and insecurity, and can take refuge from that in anger and hatred towards others. These days, I'm relatively ""successful"" by conventional metrics — I'm tall, fit, and have a job in tech — so I try and be a role model others by still being open and honest about my insecurity. I remember as a high schooler thinking that those successful guys on TV/media/etc were just better than me, and that made me angry and insecure. I think being open as a man about your feelings and transformation away from hate hopefully can provide a path for other younger men towards recovery and a happier life."

Both times, had just gotten out of emotionally-intense/loving relationships, felt heartbroken, met someone else who seemed to genuinely love me immediately after. Be honest about yourself with whether or not you are prepared to have another relationship. In both cases, I tried to be there even though I wasn't ready for a relationship again, and in both cases after a month or so I just had to admit to them that I wasn't able to fall in love back the way they had with me, and to this day I feel so shitty for that, because I feel like I led them on when I knew I wasn't ready. Be honest with yourself, for your own sake, and for hers, if you are really ready to fall in love again."
