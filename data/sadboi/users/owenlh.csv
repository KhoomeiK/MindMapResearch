in other news, my book 'take some of mine' is out. writing this book got me through things. and the poems in there, I wrote on my deathbed, I wrote in hospital, I wrote without thinking I would ever be around to read again.

'take some of mine' is about the adolescent experience. it's a collection of poems and stories of what it's like growing up in a world of chaos and illness. a story of queer love, identity, pain, and hope.  this is my story, but it's yours too.

OCPoetry,fo5i9ch,t3_g5rx9u,1587526296.0,"Good premise and concept - how the dark doesn't change, the idea that it is still feared in one way or another, as we mature it just changes. I like this idea, something I haven't really thought too deeply about until now. 

&#x200B;

I think it was introduced well originally, in the first stanza, however I do feel that the second stanza, specifically the line 'It is scary to slip from the safety of the light of day into the loneliness of night.' could be reframed as it sort of repeats the first stanza, except with less emphasis. 

It feels like there you're more making a statement rather than crafting an image, I don't think that line adds much. 

The last stanza/couple lines are really well written much like the first stanza.

&#x200B;

My advice would be to rethink 

'I go into the emptiness of dark every night without the nightlight of my soul

that I find only in my lovers warm embrace.

It is scary to slip from the safety of the light of day into the loneliness of night.

the nighttime monsters of my childhood have come back

not to disappear until the morning brings the light and with it the next day.' 

&#x200B;

Specifically, I would take it out, read the poem again and think 'what is missing now.' And then add that in as it feels like you're rephrasing what has already been said and it just takes away the effect of the first stanza. 

&#x200B;

But all in all, it's a beautiful work/poem. With some re-editing it could be even better!

&#x200B;

Sorry if that's confusing to read, I need my coffee.

If you have more specific questions I'd love to help (to you or a mod who sees this aha)"
OCPoetry,fo5hkis,t3_g5tjq8,1587525813.0,"Beautiful poem.

On first glance, I thought it didn't actually flow very well, in terms of syllables count. The first stanza had a great flow and beat to it, which i felt was dimished slightly in the second and thirs. Although this is something to keep in mind, I actually then whispered it slowly to myself and found that it does have a quiet sort of flow to it. But others might not have this patience. 

I like how, although it is short and truncated in terms of the lines, it's still beautiful and to the point, and this is one poem that has this sort of form where i feel it really suits it. You did that really well - you make each word feel purposeful and each stanza has such depth to it even if it is short. You create a great picture of imagery. 

&#x200B;

I do think some parts of it - specifically the last line of the first stanza 'especially then' and the line 'inviting deeply/you into my heart' could be edited to be more clear, perhaps on the same line or using commas. Personally, after reading it out loud, it makes sense, but some may not think to read again and you might want to make these lines easier to comprehend from first glance.

Honestly, I'm grasping for criticism here because this is beautiful!! Well done :) 

Sorry if I'm not making much sense, It's early and I need my coffee."

i just wrote this one from inspiration of reading about the things you guys have been through

it's not much and will change it, but:

 

how dare the earth keep moving/

how dare it spin on/

as if nothing has happened/

as if this is okay, bearable/

//

it must halt its orbit/

to weep with me/

and finally, when we sob ourselves/

further and further from the year long path/

we’ll approach the sun and burst/

&#x200B;

//

how do you continue /

when the unthinkable /

the unimaginable /

unspeakable /

has been thrust your way/

even worse when the world refuses to stop/

refuses to wait and to acknowledge the despair/

and the wrongdoing and the pain/

just mocks your tears with another day/

this is the end of all things.
