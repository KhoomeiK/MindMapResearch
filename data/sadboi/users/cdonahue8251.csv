omad,f41u3kf,t1_f3zl3mj,1571323863.0,"Started 16:8 for about a month then 18:6 for a week then said the heck with it and did omad. Its surprisingly easy. I don't do it perfectly... I have stevia, coffee with almond milk in the a.m., bouillon cube soup and coke zero. I only eat 1 big meal at lunch. Almost all protein now a days since I'm working out a lot. I'm really lacking in veg, but I feel great and never hungry. I can't even imagine eating more than 1 meal a day. I wouldn't mind a snack of cheese but more than 1 meal feels totally unnecessary.

Must.stay.away.from.sugar/carbs

They definitely increase hunger"
omad,f3ut3ec,t3_di7gsk,1571167029.0,"J do a relaxed omad. Almond milk in my coffee and stevia in coffee and tea and boullion cubes in a cup of hot water helps if I feel I'm craving real food tastes and a coke zero if I want a treat/boost. It's not true fasting for autophagy but it's fine for weight loss.

I lost 20lbs in 3 months (without exercise) which is a lot since I don't have THAT much to lose and I find it is easy to stick to.

Come up with your own rules that you can stick to and then be strict based on your own guidelines. 

Good luck!"
Anxiety,f2fbyxg,t3_dd1abl,1570214815.0,Me too. Lifting is the only relief I've found other than heavy drinking which doesn't go so well long term.
BulkOrCut,f2eyklx,t1_f2eecfq,1570206511.0,"Thanks for the wisdom, it is much appreciated!"
BulkOrCut,f2doc61,t1_f2cueff,1570159721.0,"I've got a very basic routine using the machines I've managed to figure out. I split workouts into upper and lower body days and some ab training at home every morning. I'm using Jefit App so its consistent and I can easily track my progress.

I've been doing 3 sets of 10, where I can't lift after the 10th. Should I go lighter and do more reps or higher weight and do less?"
fasting,f2bsn4o,t1_f2brrzi,1570130525.0,"As for fasting....I've been doing omad 
for 4 months. I don't think the actual fasting caused any chemical magic for me BUT the act of controlling when I eat and then seeing the physical transformation has empowered me a lot. At least now I can control what my body looks like and hunger no longer runs the day. It's become a sort of hobby of molding and hobbies are great for depression."
fasting,f2brrzi,t3_dcpatw,1570130172.0,"Cutting carbs and sugar completely has helped my anxiety/depression but now I feel ultra sensitive to carbs. If I have a piece of pie I know in 30-60m I'll want to crawl into bed and die, which i guess is good motivation to not eat the damn pie.

 Strength training has also helped 100%. If I skip a day anxiety and the sinking feeling of pointlessness returns really quick. It's still hard to get myself to the gym but I try to remember how energetic and productive I'll be after vs. Sitting around and sulking in my thoughts further.

My psychiatrist didn't want me to come off my antidepressants because I had been on them since a teenager she said I never learned how to deal with stress. I took this as an insult and a challenge and now that I'm off the pills for the first time in my life I'm making a point to manage the stress of being alive.

But let's be honest, it is all pointless...right?

Well....good luck in your efforts!"
BulkOrCut,f2bj558,t1_f2bih8g,1570127121.0,Perfect advice. Just what I needed. Thanks!
intermittentfasting,f2bibrw,t1_f2bi3gd,1570126816.0,Plenty of sleep and I am not a napper. Only ever sleep at night and in bed so it is very strange.
intermittentfasting,f2bfmi2,t1_f2be72x,1570125793.0,I've got a cheesecake in my fridge and I haven't had the urge to touch it. I'm going to hope that's the acv magic. I'm also doing omad...4 months now. The idea of eating more than 1 meal a day seems exhausting and unnecessary. But...cheesecake...that's difficult to resist.
intermittentfasting,f2beuw7,t1_f2bej4f,1570125513.0,"A little. It has a bit of goop in it, must be mother. Haha"
intermittentfasting,f2belvu,t1_f2be72x,1570125420.0,Does it make you sleepy? I had it for the very first time and I went from pumped up from the gym to dead asleep on the couch. It was very peculiar.
BulkOrCut,f2b5l54,t1_f2b4i9l,1570122082.0,It feels so good! Just need to figure out wtf I'm doing.
intermittentfasting,f2awv04,t1_f2avrte,1570118819.0,"And if its motherless acv, is it of any use?"
intermittentfasting,f2avrgv,t1_f2auvit,1570118376.0,"Some say it helps with hunger. Lowers insulin. 

I just had a lemon acv tea and I fell asleep so hard and quick. I don't know what that's about, but I'd really like some answers! :P"
intermittentfasting,f2asr5b,t1_f2ars44,1570117340.0,How can I know?
omad,f243gud,t1_f2347w9,1569944060.0,Thank you kindly!
omad,f230gme,t1_f1xkxdz,1569901955.0,"You're right & said what I needed to hear. It's easy to assume if I eat the same but start to exercise that I'll lose even more weight but it's just not that simple. 

My smart scale says 20.2% body fat, though I realize these may not be very accurate.

I'm eating about 10% carbs (from veg), 50% fat and 40% protein from about 1000-1200 calories. I don't think I could physically eat anymore in one meal but I've gotten so used to eating 1 meal I feel like a glutton eating 2 meals though that's probably the answer here. Unless there is a magic component I'm missing."
omad,f1tbo7e,t1_f1tb6vf,1569741822.0,My school even has a nutritionist and actual chefs but they still serve 70% carbs 20% protein and lucky if we get 10% veg. Poor kids have no chance growing up on pasta bread and other starchy foods.
omad,f1tav1f,t1_f1ta7zi,1569741456.0,You're probably right about not getting enough greens. I'm a teacher and school lunches sadly don't provide enough veg!
Anxiety,f0ww9ls,t3_d6vsdb,1569015300.0,"I can relate. Right now it all feels like a bit much but I'm trying to remember it cycles up and down. It won't feel like this forever. Lifting has helped my anxiety immensely (despite the anxiety about being around people at a gym). 

Good luck, I hope it cycles up for you soon! Head up!"
Anxiety,f0wvqjd,t3_d56opw,1569014997.0,I reduced carbs and sugar and noticed a huge difference in my depression. Now I get depressed when I eat bread/pasta. It is very noticable and I'm slowly losing the desire to eat bread as a result so win win!
