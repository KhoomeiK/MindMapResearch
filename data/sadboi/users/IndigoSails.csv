Also to avoid social shame and her reputation/image being tarnished when she really has a shitty character. She's deflecting responsibility to live in her fantasy world because she knows she's wrong and doesn't want to  accept responsibility and be accountable for her actions and the fallout to come.

My brother still treated the children as his own remained a father in their lives until the mother's toxicity took over. The two oldest kids turned on him, said you're not our dad, we don't have to listen to you, we don't need you, etc., and he respectfully ended communication. 


3 years after the fall out with the former children later the eldest son is sentence to 45 years for a string of felonies he confessed to. Middle daughter has 3 children 3 different fathers only one of her children's father is known. Youngest son was lied to told dad abandoned him. Vowed to never be like that. Joined the Navy my brother was his commanding officer. They had a long convo when he learned the truth they mended their relationship.
Went to therapy together my brother is his dad, that's his son. That nephew ended communication with his mother after she continued to lie and when confronted with evidence reacted as the sadistic narcissist she is.

My brother got therapy, healed, joined the Navy and is now retired. Never wants to marry again, had children via surrogate and is an excellent dad to awesome boys. Has a nice woman that loves him but also doesn't want marriage. I'm glad didn't let the pain or hatred consume him."

Mid teens severe mental breakdown new Psych was a religious fanatic with a God complex arrogant know it all. Didn't listen to parent or review my previous medical history despite my old Psych contacting him. He purposely triggered my PTSD to prove that I was faking it because he knows everything, and  according to him teenagers are attention seeking and fake mental illness to be popular.

He kept triggering the PTSD and I blackout and I remember waking up in the Psych ward in isolation. He was injured decided to sue. When the hospital found that he never did a evaluation, didn't review my medical history, and ignored the facts he was suspended. He dropped his suit because he didn't want his license to be permanently revoked.
