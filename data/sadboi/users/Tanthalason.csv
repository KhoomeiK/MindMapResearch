Hunting,fqdr9st,t1_fqcywdw,1589295206.0,"You probably need a damn good reason to own it, it has to stay locked up (or held at the local constables office in the armory), ammo separated from the rifle and in a different locked case and can only be taken out and transported to a sport shooting range (or hunting with a special license of course and even then some countries limit the type of rifle and ammo allowed for hunting), again locked in a case with a separate locked case for the ammo. Any violations of these rules typically results in the forfeiture of weapon, ammo and license PLUS a large fine and possibly jail time.

I didn't want to drive 3 hours one way to retrieve it, so I texted the provided contact number and asked if they were willing to ship. They said yes and I sent them a payment via Google pay and my address for shipping. They said they'd send me the tracking info that evening. 

I know I was the moron for trying to buy anything from Craigslist but I couldn't find it anywhere else. The price was reasonable (not massively under priced and obvious) the English on the post was good and the picture provided was a legitimate picture not just stock photos. 

Anyway, I hadn't heard anything by 8 or so that evening so I tried to text/call and the number had been disconnected. I emailed and got no response. 

I filed a dispute with Google and was told I'd processed a transaction for stolen goods and thus was ineligible to dispute and to try contacting my bank. Bank told me they wouldn't do it because using Google pay in this instance was as if I went to western union and wired money to someone."
