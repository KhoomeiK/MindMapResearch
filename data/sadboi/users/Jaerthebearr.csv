Its insulting for a little while when they taunt you, but once you see it 1000 times or so it really starts to lose whatever effectiveness it had.

Plus, once you get to that point you can usually dunk on Survivors anyways, and controll the match the way you want to."

To me ""Pet"" implies ownership, Property, somthing that you have control over.

I dont feel like I Own my Animals, I feel that I protect, and care for them, so ""Companion"" is the word I normally use in place of pet, or the name of the species I'm referring to , Like Dog, Cat, Bird, Etc.

But Spectral blades just doesn't *feel* like blade dancer Imo

Blade dancer was all about speed, maneuverability, Snap reflexes, etc. Etc. The entire class was based around being mobile and being fast, both on the Draw and in the literal sense. Spectral blades is more patient, more passive, and has an entirely different feel than blade dancer. 

It might be used for the same purpose, but that doesn't make it feel the same to me ðŸ˜«

Arcstrider also doesn't hit that note for me, it doesn't have the same kind of synergy that Blade dancer had within its class, likely to no fault of it's own, but because of the restrictive skill system of Destiny 2. I also just don't like the big stick, would rather have a big knife lol.

Destiny 1 Nostalgia hitting hardddddddddd 

I hope Destiny 3 Has Blade Dancer"
