Showerthoughts,fnn9j2n,t1_fnn93gw,1587087379.0,"yeah, their brains might have a different clock speed.

Much like how different computer CPUs have different speeds. A 3GHz processor has a quartz oscillator that ticks 3 billion times a second, and 2 GHz one's clock ticks 2 billion times a second.

As the faster processor can ""think"" more stuff in 1 second than the slower one, time will seem to pass slower for the faster one.

And 1 second will seem longer for the faster CPU than to the slower one as a result

Another interesting thing is that time appears very slowed down to a fly for example. For us it appears like a fly has instant reflexes but its just that a fly's brain is so much smaller (and simpler) that its ""clock"" can tick way faster than our massive brains.

Because electrical signals in the neurons travel with finite speed, and for the time it takes to just send some information across a human brain, across a fly's brain information has already been sent hundreds of times.

And as a result we appear as some super slow giants to a fly lol.

Also we would be fast af to dinosaurs."
Showerthoughts,fnn8yd2,t1_fnmvraa,1587087017.0,"Actually there is an objective concept of time too.

for 1 second light travels exactly 299,792,458 meters, in perfect vacuum.

There's a thing like planck distance too, the smallest unit of scale ever, but its all theoretical quantum weirdness.

check out the youtube channel VSauce btw, theres alot of cool stuff like that, and in other similar channels."
Showerthoughts,fnn7oqo,t3_g2pwct,1587086216.0,"There indeed is big or small.i get what you mean though.

Take look at this: [https://imgur.com/a/BT4T76r](https://imgur.com/a/BT4T76r)

There are 2 examples with a camera looking at 2 objects of different sizes. The difference in the second example is that the camera is moved towards the objects.

On the right there is a ""screen"" showing what the camera sees.

&#x200B;

Notice how in the first example the bigger object appears bigger than the smaller one (as expected)

But then in the second one the smaller object is so big it covers the whole screen. It appears larger than the (objectively) bigger object.

This doesn't mean its bigger though.. You can see for yourself that in the top down view, one object is clearly bigger than the other one. One object is more squares wide and high than the other one.

The key here to prove it is to use an objective unit of measurement like the squares above, a coordinate system. And that's exactly what we use.

So irl you'd say that something is 5x5x5 meters big, and the other thing is 1x1x1 meters big.

&#x200B;

Another example is when move your finger real close to your eyes it can appear bigger than anything, but that's just how you see it. When you cover the sun with your hand so it doesnt shine in your eyes it doesnt mean its now bigger than the sun lol.

this is indeed life changing for most people on the whole planet, and this pandemic is no joke, but we are all in it"
offmychest,fn2iext,t1_fn2fa8e,1586590149.0,"people who enjoy lockdown have mostly online friends and people who dont enjoy it have mostly real friends.

thats the main difference no? i call bs on that introvert/extrovert stuff. so, make online friends ig?"
offmychest,fn2htzz,t3_fyyni0,1586589542.0,"it doesnt for a alot of people. but as long as some people are racist, racism will be seen"
offmychest,fn2hbtz,t1_fn2fj7r,1586589015.0,"also, your exact situation reminds me of a video from the youtuber exurb1a, i dont remember which one tho but its there somewhere. He talks about that exactly very insightfully

He's a bit existential at times tho, and sometimes unnecessarily so, and you know as with everything you gotta take stuff with a grain of salt."
offmychest,fn2gohi,t1_fn2fj7r,1586588354.0,"oh well, it wasnt fast for sure.

one thing that helped me is the birthday of a friend. Had to force myself outside and act properly and talk with people about stuff that is important to them, and important overall. This probably did 2 things - forget my own problems for a while, and take into perspective that there's a whole world out there which is so different with different experiences and its not all black and white as i thought it was, this seems vague but describes all the stuff like, good and bad people and etc

That didnt instantly ""fix"" it, i'd still feel down and long for a better world.

I saw in reddit somewhere that writing whats in your mind can help, so i did. and oh boy this looked incredibly ridiculous, a massive wall of text just staying there containing the most embarassing stuff i have written. But its like you're admitting it and letting it go or idk. But helps you structure your thinking and seperate negative things one by one instead of viewing it all as just a whole ""bad situation"" you can never have the motivation to get out of, so you just do what you like to do now most -

&#x200B;

On a side note, still blows my mind that life for 2 people can be so dramatically different while they stand just only 1 meter apart, seperated by a wall (i mean in a building)The only difference is their situation as they \*perceive\* it.

this wasnt very related but is a thing i considered then

&#x200B;

well yea i hope this helped you a little bit)"
offmychest,fn2fkj6,t3_fyy7fp,1586587254.0,"yes

its the work that is making it fly by..."
offmychest,fn2fh07,t3_fyy8jk,1586587159.0,idk
offmychest,fn2fc5w,t3_fyxpur,1586587027.0,"when you like something it may feel like that is the \*only\* existing thing in the whole universe that is so unbelievably perfect and there is nothing else it could have been.well yea but no.

i've experienced this same thing, with a rather admittedly childish thing lel - cartoons.

i was kinda depressed for some time and was watching some cartoon, and during this time i just felt so attached to it. It was perfect. The real world sucks and the cartoon is an ideal world i'd not rather live in, no, i'd BEG to live in. It was the only thing i wanted (

&#x200B;

But as times improved and started doing cool stuff, looking back at it, nah its definitely not the best thing to exist ever.

And when im feeling low, since then i havent really gotten into that rabbit hole again because i now have immense perspective. Things will get better, there are other meaningful things to consider. And there aren't things to get over in the first place

uh sorry if that looks hard to understand or weird as a result, just wrote it and posted."
offmychest,fn2dogx,t3_fyxrgf,1586585434.0,"Communicate everything. This is literally the only reason conflicts happen.

&#x200B;

If only everyone could talk more instead of act and build up anger that when finally expressed confuses the other person because they thought it was allright and all of a sudden its not, leading to wrong assumptions and what not.

and this is only one example \^

communication is the key about literally everything. this even applies to wars"
offmychest,fn2dckf,t3_fyxoda,1586585115.0,"well he most probably liked it, and even probably like yo too, cause the only logical reason not to compliment the steak much is to not seem obvious that he likes what you do / you.

of course there is more to it than that, like expressions, tone etc but still, this kinda stuff does happen
