Nanny,fqxhxdc,t1_fqx8hn1,1589732555.0,"Absolutely you can increase the time! It sounds like the parents are on board for working with you which is great!

I’m glad she’s open to learning about food, which shows she understands she needs it. There is a real disconnect for some kids. Food is one of the only things they can control, so they really latch onto it. My niece has medical issues and did not feed well as a baby, ending up with a stomach tube. My sister didn’t follow the doctor recommendations of putting in a pacifier or stimulating her mouth when feeding and my niece didn’t associate a full belly with food. This led to a lifetime of food aversions, mealtime meltdowns, and disordered eating.

I’m so proud of you for staying strong with this little one. You’re doing the right things, it takes time. My nanny kids are the champions of picky eating, but they love [this protein drink](https://www.drinkprotein2o.com/). It’s available on Amazon. It tastes like juice, but there’s no sugar. I also have got them to eat [That’s It bars](https://thatsitfruit.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjwwYP2BRBGEiwAkoBpApUuPYOuRL9K8u5Qg8aZSx1Fn5f4pa0P5YBGF9Iks3gCyiQO-nTqURoCEPAQAvD_BwE) and some protein bars. Trial and error and time time time."
Nanny,fqx680r,t3_gl9cba,1589726714.0,"This sounds like an issue that requires professional attention. She may have texture issues, swallowing sensitivity, even a palette problem. She may have a psychological issue preventing her from eating normally. I think you are on the right track. Since getting professional help might be difficult right now, here are my suggestions.

My suggestion would be no iPad, no TV, no distractions. Tell her “Jane, it’s time for lunch. Your body needs to eat. You tell me what to put in the plate and then you can eat it.” Give her one simple choice for the meal (let her choose apples or banana, for example) while you provide the other foods. Make sure the amount you are giving is kid sized! Check out USDA’s serving recommendations. A huge amount of food can seem overwhelming. Arrange it in fun ways, provide dips if those motivate her at all. Try protein drinks (pediasure, protein2O), abd make sure the food is nutritionally dense (no junk). Then set the timer for ten minutes. Thirty minutes is an eternity to a four year old. Encourage her (“The strawberries look yummy! Are you going to try the pancakes or the bacon first?”) but don’t demand she eat. Eat with her and really play up how delicious everything is. DO NOT FORCE HER. DO NOT DEMAND SHE TAKE A BITE. 

When ten minutes are up, take the plate away, praise her efforts, and be done. Always end on a positive note. Do two star charts: one for sitting for the ten minutes, one for eating on her own. Sitting chart has smaller rewards, eating on her own has larger. Try the same routine in 90 minutes. Small stomachs have a different schedule than adults. 

Try enforcing the importance of food through play. Set up a pretend grocery store and talk about the foods she is shopping for (“You’re buying spaghetti! We can make that for dinner. I put Parmesan cheese on mine.”). Print out a memory game of fruits and veggies and talk about them as you turn them over (“You found apples! They are so sweet and crunchy!”). Do food crafts like making a rainbow of healthy fruits and veggies.

Daniel Tiger has two episodes about trying new foods. Storybots has an episode about why we can’t eat dessert all the time. Read books like “Pandas love pickles” “Eating the Alphabet”, “Soup Day” or “N is for nutrition”. 

Lots of patience, lots of praise, lots of time."
