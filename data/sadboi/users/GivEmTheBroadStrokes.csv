a stereotypical young urban white male, typically single and in his 20s. This phrase is usually used to denote stereotypical ""Chad"" behavior which is ususally derogatory.

I was hoping to find a much less expensive procedure. Do you think at-home microneedling would work for the tip of a nose? Should I look into other treatments like laser?"

I live with my 70 year old mother and 90 year old father. Dad takes blood thinner meds and mom has high blood pressure but they are both mobile and self sufficient.

I'm worried about working closely in such a confined space with my coworkers and the constant customers and potentially taking covid19 home and infecting my parents.

The government has stated that with the company protocols that have been implemented, that our workplace is safe. Am I supposed to trust this? What recourse do I have?

 I have enough hours to be eligible for EI but according to the government website my circumstance doesn't qualify for EI or CERB and I feel I'm putting my elderly parents at risk. I feel people in this situation are being overlooked. Does anyone have any insight on this or should I just suck it up and continue my ""essential"" (expendable) service."

I would like to find a therapist that understands, sympathizes, and can provide counseling. When finding a therapist, it is important to find someone that you can connect with. The therapists I've had in the past have been quite judgmental or saddened by my choice of being child-free.  I do not want to be pittied or condemned for my choice. I am seeking someone that has similar values in life. Usually during a first therapy session the therapists talks about not only their credentials but they touch upon their personal lives and what brings their lives value such as their career, or their spouse, or their hobbies, or their children. That's how the hell someone would know that. I am a 40 year old woman hoping to find someone in the Barrie sub that may be able to provide a referral in my hometown."

After seven years of feeling inadequate and depressed I finally realized I needed to put my foot down and tell my husband enough is enough. Either they go or I go.  Luckily my husband loves me enough to agree. We decided to go very limited contact with his family and we are now happy. I think this sub and r/justnomil really helped me open my eyes to the solution of either going limited-contact or no-contact with the inlaws. It's okay to completely distance or eliminate yourselves from people in your life that are causing you harm.
