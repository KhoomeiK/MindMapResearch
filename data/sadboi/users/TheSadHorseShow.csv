In American politics, there's a pretty well set precedent that, when the economy goes downward, the Democrats win in the ballot box. When the economy goes up, the Republicans benefit. The economy was experiencing almost unprecedented success prior to COVID19. But covid made the economy tanked, and the presidential polls showed the benefits that Joe Biden reaped from it.

Furthermore, the progressive left has been desperate to instill socialist policies, but haven't been able to sell people, even most democrats, on them because of the economy's success. Having a huge, scary virus scared people into encouraging their government to take control to gain a sense of security, and the left has no desire to yield that control."

* He made a whole shitshow about not getting enough ventilators from the federal government. [Turned out he was way overestimating the need](https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/04/coronavirus-crisis-ventilator-shortages-have-not-come-to-pass/) just to take a shot at the orange man.

Not to mention there's a chance that [ventilators may not be all that helpful anyway.](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-ventilators-some-doctors-try-reduce-use-new-york-death-rate-2020-4)
* He waited *way* too long to disinfect the subways in NYC (not the de Blasio has been much help). Also I feel like if a Republican said [this about homeless,](https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/cuomo-homeless-situation-on-nyc-subways-disgusting-and-disrespectful/2393342/) the media would rake him over the coals for it.

* He's criticized others for [reopening their economies](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-cuomo-implores-trump-not-place-money-over-human-life-2020-3) while [he opened up Rochester](https://13wham.com/news/local/watch-gov-cuomo-holds-daily-covid-19-briefing-from-buffalo). He says we need to stay closed to save every life imagineable, unless that life is from the upstate.

I just don't see what he's done that's so outstanding. Everyone I talked to says they're so impressed with him, and I just don't see it.

Oh I think you're right. And I should probably make a point of clarifying that obviously no route is *objectively* better. And that the writers shouldn't expand the lore for the sake of it. I just felt let down by the Gregg arc, because I could kind of relate to where I thought he was going. I thought Gregg's route was going to be that he initially wants to grow up and be in an adult relationship with Angus, but when he hangs out with Mae again, he starts to question his relationship with Angus and if they're truly a good fit for each other, or were they just the only two gay guys in a small town (a point which is brought up, but never dwelled upon in game.)

During the game Gregg is the one coming up with ideas for crazy shit to do with Mae, not the other way around. They could've pitted Gregg and Angus against each other, but ultimately didn't, and that made the Gregg route shallow. Whereas with Bea, they face the uncomfortable reality that the only reason Mae and Bea were friends was proximity, and that they otherwise aren't  very compatible, and they have to live with that. They're both faced with vaguely similar issues as you pointed out, but only Bea's route actually confronted them head on."

No, I mean the taxes that are unnecessarily high due to the state and local government handing out exorbitant pensions to cops and free college tuition to illegal immigrants. The solution to NY's problem isn't more taxes; that's what got us into this mess. The solution is to slash the budget and lower cost of living.

> the net effect of which is that American wealth inequalities are now at a near all-time high?

Income inequality is a non-issue. Poverty and homelessness are *real* issues. Which country would you rather the U.S. be: a country where the poorest earn $50K per year, but the richest make $50 million, or a country where the poorest earn $15K a year, but the richest make $500K? Chances are, it's the first one, even though that one has way worse income inequality. I don't see how some other person being rich makes my life any better or worse. If I'm doing well, it's good, and if I'm not, it's bad. It's that simple. Anytime I hear someone complain about income inequality, I see a salty champagne socialist whose jealous that they're not Jeff Bezos. Wealthy socialists don't like the impoverished, they just hate the rich. If the Democratic voters of NYC tackled poverty, homelessness, and crime the way they try to get their grubby hands on someone else's money, this city would be a utopia.

> That's kind of why more and more people refuse to swallow the bullshit of capitalism.

None of this has anything to do with capitalism. The situation this city and state are in is entirely because a bunch of people attempted to legislate their way to get the economic results they wanted. That's not capitalism. The reason that young people are against ""capitalism"" is because they've been told that ""capitalism"" is the status quo, which they have a right to hate, but we're far from capitalism now.

>It's also why the billionaires are welcome to get the fuck out.
