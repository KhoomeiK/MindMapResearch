news,fr3yp7s,t1_fr3vqs3,1589870125.0,"Heads up... Law is very oversaturated right now. Really research it and the ""field"" of law you want to get into. Lots of the more heartfelt type areas are very competitive, so a ton of people end up just having to take jobs at larger law firms or working for big companies where you're not doing the heartfelt type work that attracts some folks to law. I'm not trying to dissuade you, but I just want you to be aware... Especially if you are an American and will be another college student taking out loans. I almost did a dual law program while getting my masters in social work. I'm so glad I didn't.... Although I absolutely have days I regret it too. But working for legal aid, or even as a public defender, or in one of the smaller but competitive sort of niche type areas where you do not make much money at all, meanwhile needing to live and pay off my loans... Would have been too much. And I would not have done well at a large law firm doing something I wasn't passionate about or working for a company helping to keep them out of trouble or something.... Nah. The dream was there, the desire was there, and I was good in my law classes, but ultimately I had to face the hard truth that it wasn't in the cards for me... At least not right now. I wish you good luck in whatever you decide to go into!"

This is a very difficult situation you're in and I know it's taking a huge toll on yourself and your relationships. Please remember to take care of yourself during this time as well. You must take care of yourself mentally, emotionally, and physically as well. I'm sorry I've written a whole lot here, but read through it all. I added a little bit of my background info at the bottom. I'm happy to (try to!) help guide you and point you in some of the possible right directions. 

Im acfually kind of annoyed here with how she managed to get herself released from the hospital twice now in such bad shape. Social workers often do the discharge planning at hospitals. If they aren't the ones doing it at the hospital then it'll be an RN typically (some hospitals are transitioning to using nurses for discharge planning). The social worker should be making sure your sister has everything she needs in place to return home, and if she doesn't have what she needs, then they work to get those needs covered. So...any idea how she is getting released from the hospital when she's in such poor shape and unable to do some of the most basic tasks? Are the neighbors involved when she's at the hospital too? They could be going along with her if she's telling the social worker that they are taking care of her. I'd be interested to know how she's getting them to release her without any home care, follow up care, home visits, etc. 

Op, does your sister have insurance? How is she paying for things? You mentioned unemployment...but unemployment doesn't go on for years...so I'm curious how she's living and paying for things. How are her hospital stays being covered? Is she now so obese someone has signed her up for disability somewhere along the line? 

I know everyone here wants to believe that aps can and will get involved and take over guardianship of her because she's ""clearly severely mentally ill""....well I hate to be the bearer of bad news but... it's not that easy nor as cut and dry as everyone would like to believe. 

People must understand that she may not actually be mentally ill at all. She may be perfectly fine with her situation, and be simply manipulating people who are helping her to get them to do what she wants. IF she is severely mentally ill, and that's a **big** if, and the APS worker or social worker are able to prove it, and prove that she's incompetent, then they can sue/petition/request guardianship of her. But honestly, this is **NOT** as cut and dry as so many people on this thread want to believe that it is. It is much more difficult to gain guardianship of an adult than it is a child. Adults have rights. They have the right to self determination. They have the right to eat themselves to death, kill themselves slowly via poor eating and zero exercise or movement. I know this isn't what people want to hear, but it's the truth. There may be a way around it in your state so look into it, and absolutely you (op)  should try calling APS  and see if they will come out and open a case on her, but the likelihood that someone can take guardianship of her is pretty slim. But again, don't let that keep you from fighting to find a solution. 

Okay, I read through some of your other comments (just now after typing all the above)...havent read yet what people have responded back to each of your comments though. 

--Can you confirm the country you live in at least? I'm assuming in the USA...but can't be certain just from your comments. 

--Do you have any idea how she's convincing the hospital she's able to go home and care for herself?

--you may want to ask the neighbors if she has opened up to them about anything at all. Past trauma, sexual assault or trauma, a personal loss, etc. Also ask them if they are part of how she's convincing the hospital she's competent to go home and care for herself. As in, is she lying saying they come over and help and take care of her, or are caregivers even, and they go along with that while at the hospital, in order for them to release her?

--how is she paying for things? How is she paying to live in a house or apartment, how is she paying her medical bills, for food, etc.?

--Yes, you absolutely can call APS and see if they'll come out and evaluate her and see what they say. The likelihood of them being able to take over guardianship of her is slim, but you can call them out and see what happens, what they say, and see of they have any advice or resources they can offer, give you, or point you in a good direction for trying to get her some help. 

--yes, there are eating disorder treatment centers. I've actually got one in my city. But I'm not sure how common they are. They do exist. They also cost money....so considering I'm not sure how she's surviving right now....and I'm not sure you know either, she probably can't afford it. There's also the whole issue of shed probably refuse to go to which you have no leg to stand on bc she's a grown ass adult. 

--depending on where you're located, you may have a decent public or county mental health center/crisis team/etc. If you're in a rural area, the resources will be slim to none, but that doesn't mean they don't exist. Look up your county's mental health provider, you may be able to get someone to come out and assess her that way. Especially if the APS route doesn't pan out (or if it ends up taking too long). 

I have more questions I can ask and help you with, but I'm trying not to bombard you, lol. Please feel free to reply here with answers to my questions so I can further try to guide you a bit, or feel free to private message me if you would prefer. I'd be happy to look up services for y'all in your sisters area as well, just let me know. I've got two social work degrees under my belt and am a qualified mental health professional. While I haven't worked with any cases like your sisters, I've had cases involving some similar aspects."

The zach guest dude he has on his show was literally finishing some of his sentences for him because....???...the wife proceeds you make a joke out of it and how Zach can finish his sentences now. Then Zach dude starts talking this bullshit nonsense about the fucking apocolyse oh and some weird dude chimes in about the four British buses that were transporting their citizens somewhere..like came to get them from Wuhan or someshit...and the four buses were named the horsemen or the apocalypse or something...and the guy was like I texted you over the weekend!

It's both crazy and kinda scary that people can see the exact same event occur, but both people walk away believing two totally different events occurred."

And of course computers are a bit more complicated than what I *think* should happen in some cases, haha. I appreciate you sharing your knowledge!

Oh yes, thanks. I didn't think he was the one who did it. I totally understand what you're saying...and know there are probably people out there who would point their fingers at him. I feel like he's done us all a huge service by sharing these resources and information with us. And if he (or someone) wanted to spread viruses and crap around, they're more likely to spread it via all the documents as opposed to one or two randomly. 

Thank you again. You're absolutely so nice and kind. I can't thank you enough for your patience with me and my questions as well. I hope you get some good sleep! :)"

Is there a way to like....clean the pdf's or documents so if you share them at another time they won't contain any viruses or Trojans later on? I ask this bc I'm not teaching right now, but if I decided to in the future, I would hate to share any of these with fellow teachers, professors, faculty, or students and end up infecting their computers as well! *sigh* i guess I need to do some more research about some of this stuff. It's hard to know who all to trust and believe on the internet and such though when I don't have like...foundational computer knowledge regarding these types of things (viruses, Trojans, malware, etc.).

datingoverthirty,fgye3h5,t1_fgwrj6f,1581182375.0,"I know exactly what you're saying and agree. I'm well aware it isn't easy and that the kids have a mother already. I was simply trying to explain that some of us don't mind dating single dads. There's absolutely much more to every situation. I've seen divorces that went smoothly and divorces that went horribly. There are also the divorces and separations (for people who weren't married) where sometimes one parent isn't too interested in even really being present in the kids lives (have seen both moms and dads basically hand custody over to the ex bc they just don't seem to want the responsibility--which has gone well in some cases and other cases they've been ordered to pay child support). I was speaking on the much more simple situations, but I am absolutely aware and have been around and witnessed situations like you shared and some where it's way worse. I just wanted to let the op know that there are some of us out there who don't mind it all. Will it be easy? Of course not. But nothing really is. Will it be more complicated than dating someone without any kids? Yes, absolutely. Will I always be second or third or fourth fiddle? You got it. But that's a given. Once I have my own kids, they will be my priority as well....so I can't expect anything different out of a single dad I may date. Thank you for sharing your experiences. Dating can seriously suck as two single adults with very little baggage and no family around, it's a whole other ballgame when you add in ex partners and kiddos and custody agreements into the mix."

I have a few things that I must write and ask. First, my goodness this is a fantastic picture. I hope you have it professionally printed and framed. It's perfect in every way. Second, your hair is wonderful and so is his. Third, he's absolutely precious!! Fourth, kinda weird, but...do you have a sister? You look soo much like a girl in my social work cohort years ago. You honestly look like the dude version of her..seriously. wait a second...you went to UNT? So did I and so did the girl I'm talking about!! Lastly, I haven't seen you mention a wife nor are you wearing a ring...which in this day and age doesn't mean very much, but if you *are* doing this alone, then holy shit man..even more massive kudos to you! Adopting is awesome. And fostering to adopt is wonderful and so very needed. Regardless of whether doing it alone or with someone, kudos and massive thanks. And thanks for posting this too...who knows who may become inspired to help other kiddos because of it! 

I saw you mention you'd like to help older kids out in the future too. Dude. Your heart is huge and so lovely. Sooo many older kids and kids aging out of the system need that support so desperately. Sooo sooo many kiddos need help and support during such a difficult time. Teens are of course not easy to raise, and even more difficult when they've been through so much trauma and various struggles, some being taken away at a young age, some being taken at an older age....but so so so many never knowing what a stable, loving, supportive home, environment, and family is like. I'm not sure if you went through the system or an agency, or how you'll do it in the future, but as someone who has worked in CPS and with kiddos who grew up with abuse and neglect, from the bottom of my heart, THANK YOU. ...thank you for adopting your son. And thank you for any and all of your future endeavors, fostering, work with struggling kids, etc. THANK YOU. (And thank you to anyone reading this who has done or does fostering and adopting.
