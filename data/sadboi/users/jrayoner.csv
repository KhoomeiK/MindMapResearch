I don‚Äôt have a shit load of friends and the ones I do have are married or in a relationship so I didn‚Äôt see them that often anyway.

She took it really personally and ended our friendship. I worked from home for as long as I could and I am glad to be back at work because if I‚Äôm left to my own devices for too long I can become pretty self destructive.

Honestly for me, it took just putting aside my stubborn nature and inherent stigma toward medicine to give it a shot. And WOW my life is infinitely better now. Of course I still suffer from time to time but it‚Äôs not the consistent, relentless anxiety I once experienced.  I think these sort of remedies are for people who experience anxiety on a surface level."

As a scorpioooo‚Äî‚Äî- we def want the kind of love we give back. But honestly, sometimes I think it‚Äôs impossible. We feel so deeply and passionately that it‚Äôs kind of shitty to ask someone to reciprocate that. Especially when they‚Äôre a Gemini. I‚Äôm not saying we don‚Äôt deserve the reciprocation but Moreso that it‚Äôs sometimes an impossible ask. If that makes sense. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in Gemini‚Äôs nature to smother. Y‚Äôall like freedom and space and whatever you need to be y‚Äôall‚Äôs weird self. Scorpio just lurk in the shadows waiting for someone to bring them out of it. Really the best thing you could do, IMO, is just love him and let him know you love him. We have a hard time showing our affection in verbal ways. So be vulnerable with him and I think maybe that will show that you really care and want to make it work. Also just know that we can be insane and be patient with our outbursts and know it‚Äôs not your fault but ours for keeping things inside. The best thing about my partner is that he always forgives me for my volcanic eruptions. Because he knows I love him. Maybe give your Scorp a sweet and thoughtful gift. That would mean a lot to him. Idk maybe I‚Äôm rambling I‚Äôm kinda drunk on wine.

Scorpio,fevx2cf,t3_eqq6kc,1579402561.0,"I‚Äôm a Scorpio sun and my long term partner is a Gemini. It was also an immediate connection with us. I felt comfortable around him like I never had anyone else. We definitely have issues with communicating though. Gemini‚Äôs tend to deflect serious problems that I, as a Scorpio, want to talk about at length. We have also had times where we sat in silence and I found it deafening but didn‚Äôt know what to do. Gemini and Scorpio are an unlikely pair mostly due to communication issues i think. If you can get past that or come to an agreement it‚Äôs a wonderful combination. I never find myself bored by my partner given Gemini‚Äôs natural entertainment value and quick wit and endless trivia that I didn‚Äôt ask about.  But Scorpio can be really afraid of being vulnerable and we also tend to want to take care of our partners, sometimes to a fault that can be viewed as smothering. Which I think to a Gemini is a nightmare. I definitely have learned A LOT about myself and relationships to make ours work. And it‚Äôs been- A LOT of work. We fight, we argue and cry and act like brats to each other but when it comes down to it we can‚Äôt stay away from one another because there is this weird attraction that goes deeper than the petty nuances of a relationship. Try to have a talk with your Scorpio and see if there is something he needs more of from you. I find that Gemini can be quite aloof and scorpios, while they don‚Äôt like to admit it, are actually very needy in a relationship. You can make it work but this combo takes a lot of compromises and learning from both sides."

Scorpio,fdf6j40,t3_eksy6t,1578354446.0,"Bro- you have some serious learning to do about yourself. All those feelings of rage, jealousy, possession and being controlling are going to cause you to never have anyone in your life who isn‚Äôt terrified of you. I would suggest taking a deep inner look at why you feel that and don‚Äôt blame it on ‚Äúbeing a Scorpio‚Äù Astrological signs of all nature‚Äôs can work together. You can‚Äôt blaspheme a certain sign because that person wasn‚Äôt right for you. I hope you‚Äôre young and can work on yourself because you got a big wake up call coming my dude."
