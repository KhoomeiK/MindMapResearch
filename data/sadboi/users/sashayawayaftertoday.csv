While I waited for my appointment I read “The Complete Idiot’s Guide to Divorce”.
I would recommend it to anyone going through a divorce. It answers all the basic questions and it prepared me to meet with my lawyer. I had all the documentation and records that he needed to do his job. It gave me great piece of mind. Highly recommend."

My husband dreamed of being a professional musician. He tried and tried for years. He lived on people’s couches and did crappy temp work to support himself. In the end, he had to give up and realize he just couldn’t hack it. The dream had to die.
So? He went to college and majored in physics because he couldn’t think of anything else to do and science had always been easy for him. He took a physics class in high school on a lark and realized he never had to study. What was difficult for others came easily to him. Lacking any other direction, he continued studying physics and wound up a physicist. He’s patented several inventions, travelled the world, collaborated with the best minds, etc. it’s been amazing. But it was his fallback.
Having spent the last 20 years in his fallback job has been much more satisfying than spending the last 20 years trying to be a musician, being homeless and working shit jobs -
I think is what the author is trying to say.
Don’t waste your life trying to be an X when you can be a perfectly content Z right now. 
Sure, it’s not your “dream” but you’ll likely never make it anyway and, even if you do, how many years and what toll will the years of “trying” have taken?
Instead of following your dream, follow your natural inclination.
Or that’s what I got out of it."

I’m a preschool teachers with summers off and I about want to die by the time August rolls around.
Things that have helped save my sanity this summer:
1. Throw everyone outdoors so they can stop trashing your house. Get a lawn chair and invest in a 10 dollar kiddie pool. Throw the kids in the pool and let them go for it. Take a pitcher of water and some pb sandwiches so no one has to go back in except to poop! Don’t bother with bathing suits. This also serves as a bath. 
2. Get some paper plates, plastic utensils and a blanket and go on a picnic for dinner. Buy dinner items that can be easily transported. For me, I hate grocery shopping with the kids so I order my groceries for pickup at Walmart and I get them every Sunday while dad is home with the kids. I get hot dogs and buns,  burger patties and buns, pasta salad with chopped up steamed veggies. eggs salad for sandwiches, etc. enough for 6 nights. Plus a pizza. Plus a pack of bottled waters. I put all the dinner items where the kids can’t get them so they don’t eat Thursdays dinner on Tuesday morning. I keep my picnic basket out with the plates and utensils, a blanket and a roll of paper towels ready to go. When it’s dinner time, all I have to do is throw in some patties and buns (precook patties or hotdogs on Sunday) throw them in the bag with a few waters and hit the road to the nearest park. The mess is
Contained so throw away your trash before you leave the park. Let the kids wear.themselves.out. When they’re just about to pass out, take them home, put them to bed, done.
3. Comfy shorts and tees from target. They double as pajamas! I change their clothes once a day, usually after swimming. That’s it!
4. My kids only eat a few, select things. I’ve fought them on this for years but I just gave up forcing them to eat x number of bites. For my kids, it’s pb&j. I make a bunch of pb&js (a whole loaf) and keep them in the freezer. I take them out half hour before lunch or if we’re going out, I throw them in the diaper bag just before we leave. They keep the drinks cool while they thaw.
5. Naps. I know. But if you are a sahm with a husband who works a lot, this may be all the downtime you get in a day. At 1:00 every day, everyone is in bed. Everyone’s schedule revolves around the nap. Feed baby before you put him down. Put them in separate rooms if necessary. Pack and plays are great for little ones who like to wander around. But a white noise machine and put it on high. It may take awhile but they will eventually learn that 1-3 is naptime. During naptime you are not allowed to clean, cook or do laundry because you’ll wake the kids. You must relax and do something quiet like read, game or
Surf the web.
6. Same for bedtime - everyone is down at 7pm, period. I clean for 30 minutes. Then it’s me time.
7. Overwhelmed by laundry? Take it to the fluff and fold. Surprisingly cheap and you get it all done in one go.
8. Morning - no one gets up until 7. They stay in their cribs until then. They will eventually understand that 7-7 is sleep time and children 4 and under need a ton of sleep - which might also help with behavior.
9. High chairs. Contain the kids while you poop, fold a load of laundry or take a phone call, knowing that no one is poking someone’s eye out. Yes, even for the 4 year old - or a booster seat with a strap. Invest in some crayons, coloring books and stamps from the dollar store. They do art while you fold laundry without someone belly flopping into your freshly folded pile.
10. Going out is probably hard right now. Look on meetup and see if anyone would like to meet for play dates at a nearby park.
11. Have a schedule so your kids get used to a routine and the day doesn’t drag on into infinity with you wracking your brain trying to figure out what you will do. It’s easier to get motivated when it’s already on the schedule.
12. Totally random but I just scored a triple stroller on Craigslist for $20. The kids love it and it’s a great work out and, yes, a 4 yo can go in a stroller. Before the stroller, I had a wagon. That was also a good workout.
13. You know that saying, “the days are long but the years are short”. Right now the days and long and the years are long too. You’re doing you’re best and that is all that counts. Running yourself into the won’t doesn’t help anyone.
14. Saturday is pizza night!

ETA  - I was extremely reluctant to leave my kids with anyone. One year I hired a mother’s helper for few hours a few times one week. She helped out and got a sense of the kids’ schedule and I got some projects done. Once I got to know her, I trusted her with my kids and I could leave them with her for date nights - no problem.
My pediatrician recommended melatonin for my adhd son. Works very well.
After I had everything down to a science, I started watching a neighbor’s daughter too. It gives my kids a play date and breaks up the monotony, once you have your routine down, one more kid isn’t really more trouble than 3, it brings in a little extra money for those date nights."

I did and discovered that I largely have “not much” to look forward to. 
I am far from home among strangers. I thought (hoped) one day I could get back home - but that is exceedingly unlikely. I’ll live the rest of my life in a strange land among strange people, never speaking my home language again.  
I have asked that I be buried at home.
