Since my siblings moved out when i was younger, i used to do all these disordered behaviors when i was with my controlling mother too. Constantly told my therapist about it and we had a few sessions with therapist and the family that this is how i felt and how its affecting me but my mother never listened, she couldnt change at all despite how much it affected me. Aaaand she didnt believe a word my therapist said. I can tell she was in denial and scared but she wouldn’t tone it down? or calm the controlling? Idk :(( anyway, i then decided it was just really time to move out bc it was no help for my well-being at all. Moved in with my boyfriend (w/ lots of complications from my mother) when i was 19 and now im 21 and still have these thoughts and disordered behaviors but waaaaaay lesser and a lil more healthier than before.

But this isnt to say that you should move out too, just sharing that this is how i got through mine :) bc my mother was incapable of change is all. I do hope that soon your parents understand how their actions are affecting your mental health! You can start by telling your therapist!! If you already have and its not helping, you can tell your parents calmly about it. I hope it helps."
