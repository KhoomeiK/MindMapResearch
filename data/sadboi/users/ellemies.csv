AskReddit,fnj1ybg,t3_g22b79,1586990446.0,Once me and my girls were on omgele. We saw a guy hanging (like su√Øcide). Nobody slept that night. Thinking back it was probably a fake image but I never forgot what it looked like.
AskReddit,fnj1nue,t3_g22bc2,1586990290.0,So when i was a kid i used to go on vacations with my parents to France. This one time we were driving (downhill) trough the Alps with our old camper. Suddenly i smell this really strange scent that i couldnt place. Turns out our brakes were melting with no solution straight away. Eventually we made it down safe but i never enjoyed being in mountains again.
