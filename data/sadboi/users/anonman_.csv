hah, thats funny because I have a paragraph in my note that says,

>All I ever tried to do was help others and make others happy even if it in turn made me unhappy or caused me stress, people like me who want to die from suicide are highly sensitive people, we are deep feelers. We can spot a fake a mile away, we can see when others are hurting and not put off by others misery.

I've tried 3 times already, every time I fail because of being scared I guess. 

You are a very good writer, I have had someone tell me that I also write beautifully and poetically, I guess that just comes with being suicidal, we have deep rooted feelings and it just comes naturally.

As you said, nothing will make you feel better, I know already I can't say anything to help you, I can't even help myself.

All I wanna say I guess is I listened and that's about as much as I can do."

I got her a necklace, ear rings and a bracelet. I got her pajamas and socks. And a plush of her favourite animal. And I sent her £125 so she could go and get a beauty/self care day.

To be honest we were young, so the love wasn't exactly the same. I think young love is fake and adult love is more real and feels more intense. But you get what I mean.
