I had a partner for five years, and some way into the relationship I was very seriously suicidal, and when I finally told her her response was mostly anger.

My more recent partner however was so unbelievably kind and empathetic when I got to the point of needing to have the same conversation with her. I felt much lighter.

I plan to write a short story this year about a world where humans' lifespan has been increased to a few hundred years old, but to balance this out, to keep on living everyone has to go to the doctors (for an injection or something) every month to 'opt-in' -- otherwise, they die peacefully in their sleep."

My slightly tangential thoughts on this:

Unless we change our concepts of human agency and *free* *will*, there'll be a way for an elite ruling class to legitimise their position of power through some social license.

Very roughly... people used to say the poor are poor because they don't have royal blood, have the wrong skin color, are the wrong sex (i.e. women), are lazy and stupid, etc etc., but if (when) in the future the rich can literally genetically engineer their kids to be more physically and mentally competent and all sorts of other things, the only thing left to justify inequality becomes *free will*.

E.g. ""*sure I was born into a rich family and was biologically enhanced in various ways and am essentially privileged, but what really shaped my life was my choices, how well I've used my free will*"" (I listened to a talk from a guy at the *Ayn Rand* institute in which he said almost exactly this).

This doesn't really answer the bulk of your question, but I think there is something important here about how inequality is understood by people on the ground, given all the advances in neuroscience etc. that are entwined with the developments in automation and AI."
dating_advice,fg2wzlo,t3_ewgzys,1580459574.0,"I guess the problem is that depression can result in behaviour patterns that can cause unintentional emotional damage, and in some cases the damage could be every bit as bad as  intentional abuse.

An example:

I was engaged to someone years back, and I went through a period of being very seriously suicidal. I felt like the relationship was the only thing preventing me trying to kill myself\*. That put me in a impossible situation: on the one hand, I didn't want to tell her how I felt, because that would put her in an horrible position. On the other hand, keeping that bottled up felt dishonest and unfair. In the end, I told her how I felt, but that I was aware how unfair a situation that put her in, so she should do what's best for her, and I tried to push her away for years. I was trying to get help for myself as much as I could from that mindset, but these things don't happen quickly. It was a total cluster fuck.

Then there are those people than threaten suicide to scare their partners from leaving them. To my mind, that's far more fucked up. But I'm not sure the upshot for their partners is that different to what I did to mine.

That said, one thing I don't think is said enough is that you *do* have to be sensible about who you open up to.

Also, purpose... Christ I've been struggling with that for a long time... I've still gotten almost nowhere, so I can empathise with how you feel there.

One thing I've realised recently, is that being authentic goes along way for me. By that I mean presenting myself in a way that is true to my feelings feels purposeful in itself.

In the end, I didn't want to risk it.

That was 5 or so years ago. I lost a couple of long-term relationships because of it (how could I commit to someone else if I couldn't commit to my own future?) Things are better now, but I still find myself bored, unenthusiastic or negative a large part of the time.

What I've realised, though, is that the really unbearable thing is not the boredom or general lack of enthusiasm in itself. Rather, it's the narrative I put on all of that: *you worthless human being... who wants anything to do with you... you should stay away from people, it's not safe for them*, etc etc.

Even if -- being as generous as possible -- he had a good reason for leaving you 2 months into your pregnancy, *and* he is legitimately upset with your daughter calling your husband daddy, this reaction -- i.e. blowing up and accusing you of being emotionally abusive -- is way out of order.

He should have asked what's going on and voiced his concerns -- the fact that he didn't makes me think the generous assumptions I made above are too generous."

Otherwise, I'm fucked, but happily so, as if food is needed and cannibalism becomes the only option I'll be demanding the short straw for myself (not so much through self-sacrifice as through boredom and despair)

Edit: so I'm basically the cow that wants to be eaten from the Hitchhikers Guide and that's got to count for something"
AmItheAsshole,fbg7yio,t3_ed0cs3,1576839060.0,"I'll add **NTA** to the mix, though slightly hesitantly.

It does sounds like a red flag, love bombing, putting you in a position of debt to him etc., given that he'd somehow dropped in the price of them before you'd even got them, and that 4 months really isn't a long time, and given that his job sounds financially exploitative.

But of course it is possible that he's just loaded and 4k is nothing to him...

...but even then, as you say, there are much better things to do with 4k, and given these other options are so obvious to you, he should really know you well enough to have thought of this, too..."

I haven't experienced much abuse and nothing servere, but I imagine even the little I have received would still be eating me up inside if I'd not talked it through with so many people.

As for the worry of him getting away with it, that's a very tricky subject. Some things that cross my mind:

You say he was very young: do you think it's possible he feels a deep sense of guilt about what happened, and has perhaps punished himself over the years? How would that make you feel?

If he were to get retribution of some sort, how much do you think that would help you heal? I wonder if a key part of getting over something like this is feeling safe with the people that you allow to get close to you now. I'm not sure how much people getting justice for past wrongs helps that, may be it would? (I don't know)

&#x200B;

\*\*Full disclosure\*\*

Theoretically, I don't believe in punishment or blame. I think people who do horrible things either didn't intend to do so, or are cursed by unhealthy genes and/or upbringing that's left them with a brain able to harm and abuse others intentionally. Obviously I don't think this justifies their actions nor should it take away from the priority of protecting victims, but it shapes the advice I give in a situation like this."

What do you think the effect of staying silent will be, or have been, on you?
