CPTSDmemes,fftywb2,t3_epgukn,1580230741.0,I laughed way too hard at this.
childfree,ffd2ioi,t3_eswfup,1579812136.0,A wonderful life! Thank you for sharing.
depression,fbgiz8x,t3_eczhm3,1576850797.0,See your friend! Sending good vibes to both of you.
CPTSD,fbgidmh,t3_ed5qxw,1576850318.0,"I have vivid dreams every night. Sometimes they are nightmares, sometimes just weird or disturbing. I can't remember ever having good dreams. I have always had negative dreams. I don't sleep well and I spend time ruminating in the morning or at night. I don't look forward to sleeping some days."
CPTSD,fbghoat,t3_ed4x5c,1576849746.0,I completely understand. I get jealous of my own husband because it seems like he has less responsibilities and burdens than I have. It is exhausting having so much on your shoulders  sometimes you just have to put it aside and look after yourself or you will crash. It is hard to look after yourself - I am also struggling with taking the time to rest. But we really need it. Maybe sometimes we do just need to let something else fall apart to save ourselves. We can't do everything.
mentalhealth,f9bck4d,t3_e4h8x3,1575211327.0,Well done!!!!
ptsd,f30d2d4,t1_f2zt3xh,1570551727.0,That is so true about time. And I think that is a big part of PTSD too... being stuck in time as well while everything else moves on.
ptsd,f30cv20,t1_f2zpslx,1570551595.0,"Thank you! And yes, usually when I am stressed with work everything else decides to be a bother as well!"
ptsd,f30cptn,t1_f2zneip,1570551503.0,"Yes I saw my GP and they referred me to a psych. After discussing some of my background and concerns she suggested the assessments. I think that medication is a great help, I am on Pristiq ATM, but I think therapy is needed to get to the root of the problem. Otherwise the meds are just a bandaid fix. Definitely ask your GP for a referral! Having someone (especially a professional) to talk to really helps you learn more about yourself."
ptsd,f2zmsud,t1_f2yiqr5,1570530596.0,"That sounds great, thank you!"
ptsd,f2zmsd2,t1_f2yczvz,1570530576.0,"That is awesome that you are ready to keep battling it! I need a bit of that strength. I thought I was mostly normal but I am not sure anymore. It seems like what is normal to me is actually pretty abnormal haha. This Sub definitely helps though. Thank you for your prayers, I will be praying for you too :)"
ptsd,f2zmog6,t1_f2xu4ta,1570530425.0,"Thank you, that sounds awesome."
ptsd,f2zmnjv,t1_f2xa3o3,1570530390.0,"Thank you, that is good advice."
ptsd,f2zmley,t1_f2x64yz,1570530304.0,Thank you. My every day life is pretty good and stable too. I am married and have a good job. And I have 'fine' periods as well but I am struggling a little bit at the moment. I have been getting a bit worse over time and need to resolve some things I think. It's the comorbid depression and anxiety that are particularly troubling at the moment. I have gotten used to the ruminations and dreams. And apparently the depression and anxiety won't go away until I resolve some issues. It is a bit daunting having to go into therapy and face the demons.
ptsd,f2zmdaj,t1_f2wy5dm,1570529986.0,"I live in Australia so luckily a good chunk of my therapy is covered by our public health system. I had a lot of assessment done (interviews and checklists with the psych). It took three full sessions and then she gave me her diagnosis. I had been seeing psychs for a while though so we didn't start from the beginning, the psych and I  already knew what I might have. It was a psychologist but she specialises in Trauma and Rehab I think. It is actually great having a diagnosis. The severity is still a shock to me but it is a starting point. 

I hope you are able to get a diagnosis!"
CPTSD,f2wnz04,t3_dej13d,1570468049.0,"I do become more childish and feel very small and vulnerable around men that seem interested in me (regardless of positive or negative interest). It has become better with time. I didn't realise that I would immediately become so submissive in those situations. For me it happened regardless of my own attraction or aversion to them. It is like I automatically needed to be less assuming and more submissive around men. I also come from a family background where we learned to be obedient and submissive to authority.

Edit: My abuse happened in my teens (15/16) so I don't know if that counts as child sexual abuse."
CPTSD,f2wmw6u,t3_dekrgz,1570467677.0,"That sounds very tough. I used to be afraid of getting into a relationship in case they ended up like my abuser, and it did happen once. Or that I would be too damaged to be in a relationship and to be a good enough partner. I still have those fears. I can be a very irritable, impatient and sometimes hurtful person, but I am also happily married. My husband has a history of trauma as well and because we both understand each other's needs we help to build each other up and it has been very healing for both of us. 

I used to fear people, but I have learned that there are beautiful people out there and that we have a lot to offer the world, with our inner demons and all. 

My advice is not to sell yourself short. You never know where you might be in a few years and the right partner would be someone that can understand and support you."
CPTSD,f2wkxjq,t3_dejhyv,1570467012.0,"I completely understand. I have constant thoughts. Bad thoughts, remembering nightmares or trauma, feeling anger, fear or shame, hating myself, trying to press everything down. It is incredibly frustrating and overwhelming. But it is also good to know that you are not alone. 

I can't offer much advice because I am still learning to cope, but my psych told me to do at least one thing every day that gives me a sense of joy or achievement. It helps me to take a break from my fear or self-loathing, and instead to show myself some love. Today I had an awesome mix of junk food (ice cream and burgers) and it brought a little bit of light into my day. I'm usually strict with what I eat because I have really bad indigestion from stress. 

People have also suggested things to help calm down those thoughts, which is great. I try to go to the gym and be out in the sun. Sometimes physically removing myself from a space helps to take me out of a mental space. 

I hope that the comments have been helpful to you. I wish you all the best! Stay strong, you are not alone :)"
ptsd,f2whmr5,t1_f2wcevn,1570465900.0,"After thinking on it today and talking with my husband, I have been feeling a bit better. It has made me really look at myself and my life and it honestly explains a lot about my struggles. I have always had intrusive thoughts and terrible anxiety - but my mum is also quite an anxious person so I thought we were all just a bit anxious as a family. Thank you, I will look up the sub. I wish you all the best!"
ptsd,f2wgqro,t1_f2vcs2e,1570465600.0,Thank you MissNommington :)
ptsd,f2wgl96,t1_f2vdllp,1570465545.0,"I am happy that treatment has been working for you. It gives me a lot of hope. Thank you for explaining C-PTSD, it helps a lot. You are right in saying that it is the first day of a new life -  I feel like I need to write it somewhere and remember that. I wish you all the best for your continued recovery!!"
ptsd,f2wfpkb,t1_f2v9agm,1570465234.0,"Thank you so much, I will check it out!"
ptsd,f2v1nqh,t1_f2v0hy6,1570441127.0,Thank you for sharing with me. I have had multiple traumas over a couple of years and the disassociation as well. I thought I would be relieved with my diagnosis but it was more severe than I thought and I guess I am still coming to terms with it.
ptsd,f2sqh98,t3_de05el,1570386008.0,I feel the same. It is a huge relief actually. You are definitely not weird or weak!
ptsd,ewo362m,t1_ewnzq6s,1565603517.0,The fact you are focusing on healing is great! I used to downplay my trauma too! But being able to acknowledge it has helped my with healing and hopefully we become healthier and happier as time goes on!
ptsd,ewgsydh,t1_ewfe7lf,1565389680.0,"I completely understand. My PTSD comes from abuse and I used to have a deep fear of being alone or too close to men. And I used to feel like the world was unsafe and I would be hypervigilant walking around or being anywhere. That has reduced for me now, thankfully, but I still am wary and protective of myself around people. My therapist told me that my fight/flight/freeze response is just stuck on the ON switch - hence the bad anxiety. It sounds like your switch is stuck on ON too."
mentalillness,ewgseci,t3_co88s2,1565389309.0,"I was shocked when I read your first paragraph because it is exactly my life! If you think that you might have another mental illness, it is best to discuss it with your therapist. It may also just be your anxiety talking, that is stopping you from deciding on a career or dissuading you from doing beauty or nails. It sounds like you do have an interest that could become a career. Maybe you have made up your mind in a way because you feel like you want to try it, but the doubt and anxiety is holding you back. Don't let it win! And you don't have to know exactly what you are doing all the time. Take reasonable risks and try things out :) that is how I found my career that I love - by trying things out. 

I felt like anxiety has been running my life too. But after some therapy, starting medication and a decision to stop planning so much- I have learned to live in the moment. And life is better - don't be afraid to fail, you can always get back up - even stronger!!!!

You are definitely not alone. And planning for your future can be stressful and scary. But hold  on to the thought that you WILL get there. Wishing you peace and all the best!"
ptsd,ewfbcaf,t1_ew7konb,1565356579.0,"I had never had a flashback before so I never really felt like I had PTSD, or I wasn't so sure, even though I had it diagnosed. I always assumed flashbacks were a key part of it. I had never heard of a delayed response like this before but I am grateful to hear that other people have had similar experiences. I have been starting medication and therapy again, so you might be right, it is like these thoughts/memories are being unlocked right now. 
Thank you!"
ptsd,ewfaw97,t1_ew7j14j,1565356235.0,"I am sorry to hear that, and it sounds very scary! Thank you for sharing with me. I dissociate a lot, but the nightmares and intrusive thoughts/memories have been quite bad lately and so yes it does feel like it is in your bones. I kinda feel like  those bad memories are always there in the corner of my mind. It can be exhausting to ignore."
ptsd,ewfahqe,t1_ew7cy6y,1565355933.0,"Thank you, that makes me feel a lot better. And I am sorry that you experienced childhood trauma. I hope you are doing well now. I really like this subreddit because it makes me feel less alone, and it can be easy to get caught up in your own mind. Thank you for the kind words."
ptsd,ew7atck,t3_cn48tx,1565188906.0,"That's really unfortunate, I hope that your nightmares go away after a while! Hopefully this is just an adjustment period. However, I also find that I have more nightmares when I sleep longer. I am not sure why. It is great that you are being positive about it though! Sleep is important!"
ptsd,ew7a363,t3_cn3p6d,1565188575.0,"I am the same. My brain shut everything out after the trauma and I never really thought about it until I had an abusive relationship 4 years later that brought everything back for me. It has been 10 years now and I am still working through it, including nightmares and now flashbacks. I don't know if this is normal or abnormal, but my psych did say that the brain does shut things out to protect itself.

Edit: I was only diagnosed this year as well!"
ptsd,ew79g02,t3_cmyjo0,1565188285.0,"No one can make you anything. You decide what you are - that's what helps me when my thinking goes down the same path. 

No one can make you dirty or impure, that is not a power people have, even if you feel it and don't believe it. You are still the same, whole person, who has experienced a trauma. You are not broken or bad or anything dirty. You have just had a traumatic experience. If someone kicks you  and you broke a bone, it doesn't make you worthless, so this doesn't make you worthless either. 

I felt, and still feel, the same as you. But no one has the power to change our worth and value. I am slowly starting to get rid of the thought that i am impure and disgusting. Therapy is helping me, and I hope that it helps you too if you choose to pursue it. 

I wish you all the best with your healing journey."
