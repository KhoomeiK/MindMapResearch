From Wikipedia:
>Choking risk
>
>Perhaps because of several highly publicized deaths and near-deaths in the San Francisco Bay Area among children and elderly caused by suffocation while eating konjac candy, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued product warnings[9] in 2001, and there were subsequent recalls in the United States and Canada. Choking and intestinal blockage risk warnings have been published at more recent websites.[10]
>
>Unlike gelatine and some other commonly used gelling agents, konjac fruit jelly does not melt readily in the mouth. Some products form a gel strong enough to require chewing to disintegrate the gel. Though the product is intended to be eaten by gently squeezing the container, a consumer can suck the product out with enough force to unintentionally lodge it in the trachea. Because of this hazard, the European Union and Australia banned Konjac fruit jelly.[11][12][13][14]
>
>Some konjac jelly snacks are not of a size and consistency that pose a choking risk, but are nonetheless affected by the government bans.[15] Some products that remain in East Asian markets have an increased size, unusual shape, and more delicate consistency than the round, plug-like gels that were associated with the choking incidents.[citation needed] The snacks usually have warning labels advising parents to make sure their children chew the jelly thoroughly before swallowing.[citation needed]
>
>Japan's largest manufacturer of konjac snacks, MannanLife, temporarily stopped producing the jellies after a 21-month-old Japanese boy choked to death on a frozen MannanLife konjac jelly.[16] 17 people died from choking on konjac between 1995 and 2008.[17] MannanLife konjac jelly's packaging bag now shows a note to consumers,[citation needed] advising them to cut the product into smaller pieces before serving it to small children."
