RiseofKingdoms,fqd3sey,t1_fqcuuss,1589278753.0,"trust me you'll get bullied from whales and you'll get emotionally attached to the game because you invested so much time into it and enjoying the time growing. Youll start enjoying the game when the kingdom is peacefull for sometime and only fight when there's kill event and lost kingdom annnnnd there's a time when you'll get zeroed just because you farmed in the wrong area or your kill event points went too far. Once you've reached to 20million power player plus then you start realising it's a war game because now you have a bit of t4s but still not enough when the enemy swarms you lol. Reach to 50million power with t5 maybe more then a year or close to 2 as a Free to play player when a rich guy can do it with in months. Then you asked why is there no balance in the game, where have all the investments gone from whales buying bundles all day. Then you come on reddit and re-educate a new pencil dick player who thinks the game is ok just because they started playing Rise of Kingdoms."

SuicideWatch,fkyiuwt,t3_fl87ug,1584649606.0,Stuff that guy mate. Some people are so ignorant about others and only care about them selves. They'll never consider their negative behaviors and try to change for the better. My father was always verbally abusing my mother back in the days until I had grown older and had enough strength to give him a hiding. It was not right but the guy had to change one way or the other.

RiseofKingdoms,fe9zi1w,t3_eo7iog,1578942838.0,I play Path of Exile and the devs there are very helpful with questions about the game. Plus it's a free to play game too. I'm sorry if my comment doesn't help but I'm sadden by these devs that doesn't respond back when important questions are asked. Plus RoK players should come out and upvote any important enquires so devs can response. Path of Exile players build their own software with the help of devs and it was called path of building where you input stats from gears and it calculates the dps for you. Maybe in the future I'll donate to who makes a software especially for this game calculation.
