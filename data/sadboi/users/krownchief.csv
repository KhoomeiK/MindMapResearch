AskASociopath,fhlx09b,t3_epogdm,1581705737.0,"I'm Christian, and everyday my life is a battle. Imagine the physical incapability of feeling a moral compass, feeling empathy for people, and the thought of manipulating others is always your first thought. Despite this, creating a logical argument that you will not do this and choosing to chase after truth, goodness, and doing what's ""right""."
AskASociopath,fhlv46n,t3_ex2igt,1581705068.0,"maybe for some people, but i just draw or paint or play my instruments or whatever. there are non-socio/psychopath friends that I have that are just insanely talented but lack emotion in their work too. being able to induce and evoke emotion even when you don't always feel it is also an art in itself. if someone was actively drawing edgy things I'd be like okay maybe this is an edgy person, but I feel like in most cases, we can create things equally as invoking. Or at least I hope I so. the only thing i can relatively feel is the way my heart beats and my body gets hot when im on my art high."
AskASociopath,fhltumw,t1_fhk21sk,1581704545.0,"this is why I try not to lie about my emotions either lol. the best way to lie is to feel and believe and be genuine about your lie. because i usually tell myself how to feel anyways, this causes trouble and makes me believe my own life as stupid as it sounds. nice to know there's a bud out there that relates"
AskASociopath,fhltdnr,t3_f3i0j1,1581704411.0,"If I'm trying to save myself, I just lie. I say it enough times in my head to the point where I believe it. Don't usually get called out. Don't think I've been caught on anything major. And if I do get caught, I usually just say, ""the real reason I had to lie was because blah blah blah personal things are happening I'm suffering from mental illnesses or make up something that sounds like im being vulnerable"". When I'm lying like this I feel like I believe myself and will feel my voice get smaller and my eyes get shifty because I truly believe my lie lmao. Sometimes I can't help it, but I do my best to not lie or cause mischief. In my head, lying has short term benefits with high yield risk if caught even if you're just tryna save your behind though. Even though the urge is always there, making ""genuine"" relationships or not using people has gotten me relatively farther in life. If I do get nervous though, I pinch my thumb really hard. Tend not to focus on being nervous when im in pain. Can't recall the last time I felt nervous though."
sociopath,fhlrg8c,t3_f3rwgk,1581703714.0,"My maskless me feels like a blind person on crack. I don't see people, but I can feel, touch, smell art, chemistry, violin, and rugby intensely. I run at the things that I feel not meaning to hit the people that are around me. I really like art and I like being in my lab alot. It gets kinda obsessive, but my ""passions"" are relatively evident with or without my mask. In terms of personality, I find it confusing to think about. I'm always with my mask on because I've always lived with people, requiring some kind of work to act a certain way. When I'm alone, I don't usually think about my personality. I'm usually just working, rational, and pretty blunt in my head. The maskless me doesn't give two craps about anything besides myself. In terms of personality traits that are shared between my masks, I notice that I have a tendency to be spontaneous and bubbly at the core constantly fighting with myself. People would say that I'm more of the leader type and that I have a strong moral compass. I have to remind myself sometimes to not slip, but it's become more instinctive and a part of my personality I think. Not caring about manipulating or hurting others doesn't really matter to me specifically, but I am Christian, and I acknowledge that I have to detach myself from the fact that I don't care. It's confusing. Also, I used to have a different mask with different people, but things don't add up at a birthday party when people get together. I find myself physically unable to interact without my mask with people, but I think the mask I have with my sister feels comfortable. I have to remind myself to not be a dirtbag and laugh, but I don't mind putting in the work for her. She'd describe me as probably unstable since she does inevitably walk in on episodes...but we have a relatively strong relationship otherwise."
premed,ffa221a,t1_ff94f4o,1579726318.0,"thanks :) i appreciate the response! my gpa is just mediocre so i guess ive been borderline on whether i should just apply or look for other ways to boost. i'm not interested in an md/phd career, but I do enjoy researching enough to stick around for two more years. it is alot of money though so ill keep all this in mind"

I lost a close friend to suicide, and I still break down thinking about it. No one knew how bad it was. No one knew that his dad was abusive. No one knew. I still remember him asking out my best friend with a piece of gum writing ""Will you go out with me?"" on the inside of the wrapper. He was the hugest dork, but he made everyone feel like our orchestra was our home. I don't blame him for not fighting more, but I just want to say that I'm so grateful and amazed by your willpower.
