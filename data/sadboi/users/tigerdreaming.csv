Trigger Warning, and long story ahead warning:

Our Dad was a man of science and an atheist, our mother however was really into spiritual new agey stuff and dragged us along to psychic fairs and this churchy group thing and so forth as a little kid - it was NOT related to the abuse that caused our DID, the people their were all friendly and kind, it was FUN for us at the time.

 BUT....

You know how we hear voices (aka the others in the system)? 
Well we had told our mother and she told the people in these groups about this happening and they all decided we were in fact a psychic medium/healer.

It’s a long story but basically through a combination of these adults pushing our ‘gift’ and a particular persecutor alter, we ended up with an alter completely invested in the spiritual stuff and she had a full blown delusion about this ‘dying before we came of age’ prophecy that messed her up irreparably.

I guess that a bunch of adults got excited when they saw things that made them think they possibly had a psychic child on their hands and confirmation bias made them decide it was a wonderful gift to be developed and not a sign of mental distress.

When we hit about... I want to say 8 or 9... there was an incident & we thought we should have known about it and been able to stop a tragic event that happened.

At that point one of our protectors (I assume) just brick walled the psychic stuff, basically any thought or feeling that we could have associated with spirits stopped. Brick wall. 

We went down more scientific routes to explain “us” after that and could generally dismiss our mothers beliefs (twin siblings absorbed in utero made more sense to us then lol). But that particular alter couldn’t shake the death prophecy thing and it led to so many dangerous life choices because who cares if you’re going to die anyway, right?

Also, our mother is aware of the DID now and constantly says things like “I’m so sad for you that you suffer through this life, I don’t know why you chose such a difficult incarnation”.

I genuinely believe she means well, her beliefs include “soul contracts” and all that yadda yadda - but to me it feels like victim blaming and a dismissal and denial of any possible wrong doing on her part."

It’s really important (in my opinion) to be as honest as possible with your treatment team - theres no point in them prescribing something you’re not going to take, and being dishonest about compliance won’t actually help you - which is the entire point of the exercise- in my experience it’s far better to talk about the reasons why you’re not comfortable with that prescription or recommendation and come up with a solution (or at least a compromise) that you can all agree on.

I wonder if alters take on the characteristics of certain abusive people because those people, as well as being abusive and awful, were also often claiming to be imperative to our survival. 

As young children, the concept of being mislead or lied to by adults or people with perceived power over you is extremely difficult, if not impossible to wrap your head around.

The whole “without me you are nothing”, “I am doing this because I love you”, or “YOU are making me do this because you did/didn’t (insert thing here)” abuse narrative we tend to hear confuses us because our feelings are ‘this person is hurting me’ yet we are being told by people that we have to trust with our physical and emotional lives that it’s for our own good or it’s our fault or it’s because we are special. 

We don’t want pain, so we do whatever it takes to avoid it - that can look like very many different things but dissociation is one of them, and self punishment (verbal, physical etc) is another as it can paradoxically be a tool to try and avoid pain as we can believe it will make us ‘be better’.

The truth of course is that the abuse was never our fault in the first place, but that narrative is so strongly reinforced that the belief we are fundamentally ’bad’ and the shame that goes with it becomes ingrained in us and influences the way we develop.

It makes sense that if an alter has formed to cope that their tactic might be self punishment as in their mind that will protect from more pain being inflicted.

- sorry, I got interrupted and I’ve lost my train of thought and as I’m on mobile I cannot re read the question. I hope that made some sense and I wish you the best of luck!"
AskDID,fqs1per,t3_gj4ua9,1589596571.0,"In my experience, a lot of parts like this are hurt and often surprisingly young children. Reframing then in your mind as children who are using child like coping mechanisms to deal with their pain makes a huge difference in the systems power dynamic and can help ease the affect of their abusive tendencies. 

Acknowledging that their coping strategies were helpful once but are now no longer needed and introducing new coping skills to the system generally can be very beneficial, even if that part won’t engage in therapy at this time. 
We have a part like this who’s still point blank refusing to talk to our therapist 5 years later, she’s kind of sulking in a corner so to speak, but we’ve made space for her to talk whenever she’s ready and in the meantime our knowledge is power and she’s just not able to have any negative influence over us anymore as every time she tried we just met it with compassion and expressed understanding as to her motives. It annoyed the hell out of her, but it’s working!"
AskDID,fqs0rgw,t3_giqv21,1589596013.0,"I dunno if this is helpful at all, but thinking about it now, our old host did the social chameleon thing big time... 

Like, she’d intentionally try to be as likeable as possible to everyone around her - she’d tell one person her political or religious view was A and another it was B depending on that persons views to try not to make waves, in all honestly I don’t think she had any clue what the hell she felt or believed and maybe that lack of self was a BPD thing or partly our different influences on her. Don’t know, she’s dormant these days so I can only speculate. 

I know she used to be so furious when I’d come out when we were kids as I spoke up for what I believed in, because, well I am me, I have strong opinions and beliefs and I just can’t do the be what people want me to be thing! 
Even if I try to act differently it doesn’t work and I always quickly end up being my usual loud, a bit too blunt, overly talkative self. It’s not a behavioural thing, like I can still apply appropriate social filters - like I swear like a trooper but I don’t swear in inappropriate circumstances and if someone’s political view is different to my own I will either back up my belief in a discussion or politely change the subject depending on the circumstance, but my extroverted personality is what it is and it’s just different from hers and others in my system."
AskDID,fqry0f6,t3_gjoowp,1589594310.0,"As the others have said, that alter won’t actually die but  might go dormant- I know that doesn’t necessarily help with your circumstances right now..

We had a slightly similar situation once, while I know the alter won’t die, it’s still a crisis situation and talking to your therapist would of course be the best thing you could do right now.

Can I ask, was the person dishing out the mental harm from inside the system or an outside abuser? 

If an outside abuser, then whole system safety is paramount. 

If an inside abuser, working out their motives for acting this way is the first step. 9 times out of 10 internal abusers are acting out of a (very) misguided attempt to be protective. Learning what that is will be the key to recovery - but it’s a hard, slow and emotionally painful process. A therapist can work with you on getting through this safely.

When our situation happened, we were not aware we had DID and ended up inpatient for months - it was a total shit show. The words “attempted murder” and “murderer” were thrown about a lot and while understandable, ultimately that was a very damaging way of looking at the situation for all involved.

It took a whole lot of time, forgiveness and therapy to reach the level of acceptance we have now but we are getting there, and you can too."
AskDID,fqrvkh7,t3_gk6zk2,1589592816.0,"We had a physical suicide attempt 5 years ago and everything went cactus, it’s how we discovered our experiences had a name (DID) and there’s a big long complicated story, but essentially, the host at the time has not returned to front since. 

She was completely dormant for a few years but has been floating around the headspace intermittently appearing somewhat delusional but mostly just confused and scared, she doesn’t accept DID as a thing at all and is saying that she thinks she’s dead and this is some weird after life reality (which apparently makes more sense than DID to her, but I guess denial is a powerful beast).

Some of us try and reassure her that she’s not dead, she’s been taking a break and that’s okay etc etc, we’ve invited her to come ‘back’ but she’s just not up for it. The goal is encouraging her to front for therapy but she’s still too frightened and stuck in a self-hate-nothing-is-real loop. 

I guess what I’m trying to say is the others won’t die, they might go quiet or dormant or be confused and it’s okay to grieve for their absence but even if it takes a long time they can come back. In the meantime just be gentle, loving and understanding and keep space open for them. xx"

You know how everyone talks about mindfulness and focusing on the present moment? 
I feel like I’m stuck in the present. I’m here right now, but nothing else is real, nothing else exists and I can’t quite tell if it ever did or if I dreamed it.

The past feels like a fluid non linear blur, the parts I do remember may have been a dream or real or a merger of the two and the only way I can tell the difference is by asking someone or looking at photographs that show a self I can only just recognise cognitively to be a version of my own reflection.

My eldest kid turns 18 this year and I remember his life from birth to now like trying to recall vague snippets from a movie I think I watched 20years ago or perhaps I didn’t watch it, perhaps I only saw the trailer or someone else told me a few plot points and I wanted to see it.

I feel robbed sometimes, so much of who we are is our memory and when other people talk about how they felt when they held their child or taught them to ride a bike and I realise that I just can’t relate. 

Yet at the same time I feel completely numb because it feels like it’s not my story, it’s not my life and it feels so irrelevant and cold, just frustrating because I think I’m supposed to know things, to feel things - and I just don’t.

AskDID,fqc3rsr,t3_ghgp1i,1589249515.0,"Yeah it’s pretty common, it messes with my head a bit because I have always held the belief that you are born with your sexuality- however I experience the contradictory feelings of being straight and married to a man while knowing another alter is 100% lesbian. 

She is not attracted to men in any way shape or form and so the term ‘bi’ doesn’t feel appropriate, I know there have been sexual experiences with other women before my marriage but I don’t remember any details or feelings about them yet she apparently fondly does and hates that she’s now not being ‘true to herself’.

The others in the system seem less... tied to a sexuality, or at least they don’t seem to be as vocal about their feelings. 

I wonder if this means deep down I am gay too - since we’re all the same genetics, same brain and so forth it’s just our different experiences and memory accessibility has made us evolve our identities separately rather than singularly - but I find it very difficult to consider and we have been married for nearly 20years. 

If I’m honest I don’t particularly find anyone sexually alluring anymore, if ever? Maybe awareness of triggering body memories relating to trauma has clouded a lot of sex stuff for me. 

Or maybe I would have eventually discovered I was gay if I hadn’t fallen in love with my husband - we were very young when we met and the alter who identifies as lesbian doesn’t even like my husband as a person let alone find him sexually attractive. I worry sometimes I am just in denial.

Also comorbid bipolar 1 with psychotic features, we are all affected by mood episodes but with varied manifestations. ie I’m more outgoing and extroverted at the best of times, if we’re in a depressed episode I generally cope better for longer and can mostly keep going through the motions but some of the others can be bed ridden. 

In a hypomanic episode we vary - I tend to be very annoying to deal with. I get the over talking, spending way too much on my new “brilliant” ideas, I have to move constantly and don’t sleep, sometimes for several days. If it progresses to mania I can get rather delusional in the “I am the next big thing” kind of way and I fall down conspiracy theory rabbit holes.
One of our parts who’s always a bit suspicious anyway gets SUPER paranoid to the point of thinking our husband is a spy and another generally quiet, calm & collected, thrifty part suddenly talks & wastes money as much as I usually do (lol). If psychosis is involved she goes full on zen spiritual ‘at one with nature’, everything is a sign and means she must enlighten and heal the world. 
Another part who normally struggles with severe depression gets very agitated and can be actively suicidal, she also has frightening visual hallucinations. 

It’s pretty hard to deal with and definitely doesn’t leave a whole lot of room for safe trauma processing - so if you suspect bipolar, talk to a professional about it ASAP."

Personally I have a few parts like that, for example one thought incessantly bullying and demeaning us psychologically would toughen us up and encourage us to be ‘better’ and ‘try harder’ so we wouldn’t be hurt by some people in our life also punishing us by scarring our body in visible places that meant we had to cover up in public making us uncomfortable in summer all to encourage us to ‘try harder’ to not get hurt - keep in mind this was essentially the view point of a small child based on a conclusion of the environment they witnessed.

IMO humans in general tend to lean towards a feeling of separated consciousness, it’s apparent in the way we use language, like people on the whole will describe physical parts of themselves with ownership like “my leg” or “my brain” rather than “this leg/brain” which puts “them” as separate from their body.

I know my own experience is me and I am in this body, but the other consciousnesses in my system also experience various levels of disconnect and relatability to the body. My singular experience of life however is not the whole experience that our body has lived though, each of us contribute to this body’s memories of its life, together our experiences form a whole person consciousness/body experience of a life but we can’t feel that whole experience due to the dissociative disconnections, amnesic barriers and so forth.

Our current co-hosts predominantly lack the severe self esteem/acceptance issues & I wonder if perhaps accepting each other as individuals has allowed for a general necessary inner growth and self acceptance that might bleed into our ex host wherever she may be...
I wonder if she’d cope understanding that while we are all still experiencing different consciousnesses with unique experiences etc we are actually parts of each other meaning the good things we see in each other are actually good things in ourselves too...

AskDID,foir07q,t1_foij3we,1587794236.0,"Hmm.
I agree. I feel we are not really different people, even though I feel totally different to my system mates.
I guess ultimately when it comes down to it, it’s easier to understand if you think of it as a memory disorder... dissociation leads to lack of proper creation/storage of memories. Situations will trigger access and blocking of access to these memories.
 
As we have different memories those amnesic barriers allow us to have different perspectives and over time this fosters the creation of different identities. Therefor our individual experiences exist and are very much real, yet (IMO in my case) if you separated us all out and put us in different bodies none of us would actually be able to function well. We work together, even when not consciously aware of it, we are a system. 

As a system it is our responsibility to seek help if we are having trouble with things in life such as anger or depression etc- this means therapy and commitment to doing the work. If one of us commits a crime, we are collectively responsible.
Really it is no different to someone getting blackout drunk and committing a crime, they still did it even if they don’t remember or can’t relate to why they did it and if they have a tendency to do illegal things when drunk, it is their responsibility not to drink or to seek help for the behaviour.

AskDID,foin0b6,t3_g7e96f,1587790894.0,"We shaved our head as a teen...  here’s the long version:

Funny, reflecting on this.
It was a decision initially made by one part (who has a tendency towards mania & an impulsive streak), this was before We knew we had DID of course and my own memory surrounding it is really weird.

I know I knew the plan before it happened because I am kind of conservative and sure as sugar didn’t want to draw any attention towards us and so as a 13yr old long haired female in the 90s I certainly didn’t want her to shave our head!

Basically we collectively freaked out (except her, apparently) because we already got bullied so like, whyyyyyy  the hell would you do that?! But she had decided for some reason and so it was going to happen like it or not.  

Apparently, I’m told now, to her that was really confusing because she knew exactly what she wanted to do and couldn’t understand why she kept weirdly hating the idea for moments at a time. Sigh, DID Hindsight.

Anyway to cement her decision she officially told everyone (friends, family etc) we were going to do it and that it was to raise money for kids with cancer to make it “socially acceptable”. Of course then everyone was supportive and nice about it so she knew she (aka the rest of us) couldn’t back out if she unexpectedly (we) changed her mind. We (and I especially) really struggle with breaking commitments, even when we got talked into them and know they are unhealthy for us) 
Lol, I’m apparently still shitty about this, can feel my blood pressure rising writing about it! 
Basically a certain someone who told everyone ended up getting it done at school on the gym stage in front of everyone. (Aughhhhh!!!) 

Her response to this is “but we raised like a grand for the leukaemia foundation!” 
Cool, and I got bullied even worse about new things which of course Miss impulsivity didn’t deal with because she was the outgoing happy one who never had any freakin problems.  again, in hindsight DID.

If we take sumatriptan as soon as we realise it’s heading into migraine territory then it will ease the pain in the head enough to lie on a pillow in a dark room so we can fall asleep - we still get the other symptoms (aura & nausea) though, it only seems to mask the actual pain though and if we tilt our head too far or move too fast we will feel the intense pain again.

But she has known us for a good five years, seen the ups and downs of the mood episodes, witnessed paranoia and confusion etc as well as the dissociation, trauma reactions and of course the switching.

She commented that there’s a whole lot more to schizophrenia than just hallucinations & delusions all of the “negative symptoms” as they are called actually play a big, if not the biggest role in recognising and separating schizophrenia from other disorders. 

It’s like how DID is of course a trauma disorder, so as you know the most talked about symptom of alters is just one part of a whole very big picture. 

The “whole picture” is noticeable to doctors over a period of time, not just through told experiences shared with them by clients and/or family members, but through body language, behaviour patterns, thought patterns, reaction patterns and so forth. 
These are all what goes into a carefully considered diagnosis and sometimes there are traits of disorders that don’t meet full diagnostic criteria & sometimes there are co morbid diagnosis’s and overlapping symptoms. 

The key is finding the most accurate diagnosis so you can get the most accurate treatment for the symptoms that are causing harm in your life.

AskDID,fnjd6pl,t1_fngvo8k,1586996595.0,"- this turned into an essay, sorry!

As per my understanding...
In the sense of intentional ‘faking’, there would have to be a specific, intentional (known & understood by the person doing the faking) payoff or gain - so yeah, like to try get out of being responsible for something or to gain money (ppl might donate because they feel sorry for a person etc) - that’s more con artists though- or to try and gain sympathy from someone they don’t feel will give them what they need emotionally/physically if they don’t lie about their circumstances.

In the sense of genuinely believing you have a particular disorder that you in fact don’t, things get more complicated - this is not the same as ‘faking’ though, even if it involves unintentionally misleading self & others about your circumstances.

In this situation, misunderstandings, a lack of education about the issue, a lack of objective help/support with your concerns (such as an appropriately qualified therapist) could lead to the belief you are experiencing a specific disorder that isn’t actually an accurate fit for your circumstances.

There’s this thing called ‘confirmation bias’ and all humans do this to various extents (not helped by social media & modern algorithms) where if you tend to feel a certain way about something, you’re more likely to find things to back that feeling up. 

This gets exacerbated if there’s health anxiety involved, like the whole Dr Google issue. If you google “pain in left little toe” chances are you stubbed your toe and it’s just bruised but if you keep reading you’ll probably see “toe cancer” on a list of ‘rare’ symptoms somewhere, you might click for a laugh & then notice another symptom is tiredness & then you think “I’ve been tired lately” then you’ll click another box with sore toe & tiredness symptoms, it’ll lead to ‘headaches’ etc and before you know it you’ve forgotten you just had a sore toe and are freaking out about possibly having MS, a variety of cancers and probably in some cases, DID.

But in regards to this topic, this can go both ways. For a personal example, if I read the DSM criteria for Factitious disorder I might tick one box, if I read the criteria for DID, I tick every single box, but if I’m in a doubting mood I will choose to believe that the one box I tick for factitious disorder means I definitely have that disorder, therefor I’m ‘unintentionally faking’ and go into a shame spiral about how I’ve wasted resources, been a bad person etc I’ll completely disregard the alters talking to me (usually telling me I’m an idiot because they’re talking to me right now so obviously they exist) and of course the fact that I tick every single criteria required for a DID diagnosis.

When I mentioned the whole thing that the media talks about where they say therapists have actually caused the DID symptoms in their clients to my psychiatrist, she said that yes, some therapists could unwittingly (or intentionally which would be abuse) encourage a belief in the existence of DID in a particularly vulnerable client when it wasn’t an accurate diagnosis.

She commented that there was unfortunately potential for a therapist to get “excited” by a client presenting with some of the symptoms of DID because it is a unique disorder that’s not widely seen in most practices, and because of the therapists own fascinations (or an existing confirmation bias) they might keep going down the wrong track (like the “Sybil” kerfuffle). 

On the whole feeling like you’re accidentally faking of your own accord, she said that well aside from overt presentations of alters, there are a whole lot of patterns to ways people behave & the way they physically and emotionally react to things in the present that are very indicative of their past trauma experiences and the way their body has reacted to it, even when ppl have no or only fragmented conscious narrative memory of trauma, it’s apparently evidenced in subtle ways through body language, verbal patterns, emotional dissociation with certain topics and even the subconscious experiences of their childhood circumstances from decades earlier.

She said that in my case all my subconscious present time reactions/behaviours etc are congruent with the history my alters and I have been consistent over the time she’s known me - apparently that can’t be ‘faked’ intentionally or otherwise which means in her professional opinion that this is an accurate diagnosis for me. 

Accurate diagnosis takes a long time but accepting it takes a whole lot longer!!"

I feel that shouting and yelling at someone that is (in this case the guy appears to be) frightened and confused isn’t going to do anything but inflame the situation and make them more frightened, more confused and more likely to react badly or aggressively.

Running him over in reverse like that was totally uncalled for, if this video is an accurate portrayal then I’m really quite frightened of Australian Police protocol and don’t trust their ability to make good judgements for the safety of citizens and their own officers."
AskDID,fnfl5jm,t3_g1ghce,1586910220.0,"So I’ve been officially diagnosed for quite a while and I still have phases of severe doubt, I spent an hour talking with my psychiatrist yesterday about recent self doubt etc (triggered by all the recent community drama). She diligently validated me and gave me a thousand reasons why my system is valid, why the diagnosis is real and applicable to my situation and why some people choose to consciously ‘fake’ stuff and how there are big differences in ppl who subconsciously take on characteristics of disorders that aren’t really applicable to them and ppl who experience them organically. 

She’s known us/me for five or so years & never once been suggestive or leading in her questions, she doesn’t ask to speak to specific alters (not that we can do that anyway) and lets things flow naturally with whoever is there in the day. 

When I questioned the diagnosis (again) she said as she’s known us so long, heard our stories, met various alters, observed our attachment patterns, attention seeking styles and witnessed our growth, struggles, reactions etc and that these are all congruent with DID, she also said that sometimes when you’ve been invalidated your whole life it’s really extra hard to accept something big like this and trust yourself even when your heart (and your trained professional) tells you it’s true because your default belief is that somehow you will always be wrong. That takes a looong time to unlearn.

So I guess... 
It takes time, if you see a trauma specialist who understands dissociation and believes in DID then just be completely open with them about your concerns and how important it is that you have them work with you in an objective way. 

Target treatment rather than diagnosis, because no matter what label you want to put on it, you are experiencing a set of symptoms that impact your life and you want to find help to cope in the healthiest ways possible.

If you approach it that way then you can slowly explore what is happening, safely and without judgement, then if there’s a label or official diagnosis that is applicable and will help you move forward then your therapist/psychiatrist will apply it gently and appropriately.

From our experience  a bad day is when your feelings and the situation kinda line up with each other, like you might get super depressed or whatever but there’s some sort of real life event that is the cause. 
Having a great day and suddenly being overwhelmed by sadness or feeling suicidal is usually due to a trigger (but we might not realise it’s a trigger) and/or another alt passively influencing.

In our case with a particular persecutor part, more often than not they were “directing” or chastising an ex host verbally making her sad than causing sad feelings passive influence style, the feeling we’d get from the persecutor was overwhelming hostility (and at times love but a little too sweet and with a catch) rather than sadness but they’d more likely say we needed to SH or die etc to “fix” things rather than actively switching in and doing those things - although that did happen too... 

our persecutor alt in this case was very psychologically abusive towards this old host in particular and would essentially convince her to do/not do certain things because they were “for the best” or as a punishment for something or other, it was only when she was refused by the - I hate to say ‘weaker’  ex host that she could actually take over and act stuff out (only happened a few times).

I tend to ‘come to’ with a bitch of a headache and we’ve apparently been crying in a corner or in another shed somewhere (were on a farm, loads of sheds) and all I know is she wants to die because she feels stupid and useless but I’m not sure what the fuck we did and he’s not talking to us. Again.
Pisses me right off.

He will get angry and ignore us for hours or days thinking we were doing (insert issue here) to spite him or something (which is completely ridiculous, because it makes OUR life harder). There have been so many occasions where I have personally suddenly discovered he’s angry with us and had no idea WHY and obviously I can’t apologise specifically (because I don’t know the reason) then when I just try to apologise broadly he gets even more angry and says I act like I don’t even know what I did wrong (!!)

They wonder why I want to leave him.

Sorry, that turned into a selfish rant, I guess I’m just trying to say you aren’t alone here and sorry your struggling too. Amnesia is bloody hard to navigate.
Good luck

DID,fma5opq,t3_ftwpod,1585884476.0,"One of the things about amnesia is that you don’t tend to remember what you don’t remember until it’s brought to awareness by a third party.
For example I don’t remember yesterday but didn’t notice until I read your post and tried to think about yesterday...
Also big things, such as, I don’t remember my wedding day although I know some details like where it was and the date it happened, didn’t realise I actually didn’t remember until someone asked me questions about it that I couldn’t answer but should know such as what was the wedding cake like and did my father walk me down the aisle...
It hurts when you become aware of how much time is actually lost but it’s surprising how well you can skate by without realising you have such a fragmented memory."
DID,fm9897z,t3_fturc1,1585863597.0,"Heya ((hugs)) sorry things are so hard, I can really relate to this right now. 

We are struggling big time with suicidal thoughts at the moment, some of us really need to be in hospital but we don’t have a hospital locally (state borders are shut so can’t travel) that treats people with DID and at this stage going in under the guise of “just” depression probably won’t actually be beneficial to us.

Not to mention that we are scared that there would be a terrible reaction when an inevitable switch occurs plus some of us are struggling with the thought of placing more of a burden on the overloaded hospital system when people who are probably less broken and more fixable would get a lot more from the available help and we’re always going to fall back into this trauma loop so some of us feel that from a “greater good” perspective, maybe we just aren’t worth treating.
It’s really hard to keep fighting, even to want to try to fight.
Sorry, this isn’t helpful to you at all, I guess I just want to say that We get it xx"
DID,fkx5xj8,t3_fju3kk,1584619795.0,"I understand this, the routine and lack of having to be responsible for a million different things seems appealing to me too.

I kinda knew these people existed in a vague hazy subconscious they-look-familiar kind of way, and had their names etc figured out after a few days, there was ZERO emotional attachment because they weren’t MY family. It was fucking confusing.

DID,fkx442i,t3_fk4gux,1584618026.0,"I’ve been getting the odd “real” (not traumatic) memory handed to me recently, they’re actually like little movie clips rather than a still image associated with a photograph from an album or just a faceless vague paragraph of a story.

I had one the other day of myself as a child eating a piece of Blackforest cake from a cafe in a mall food court - it’s a very short memory, a few seconds worth, but it is so vivid - I can see (from my eyes and my perspective) the 4 seater table we were sitting at dark green laminate with a worn timber edge and there are people around us, it’s very busy, I can see the way the front of the cafe looks and oh my god, I can even remember the taste of the cake, sour cherries, cream and it had a chocolate mousse layer in it!

Sorry, it was extremely exciting, I have had so few of these types of things and the fact that it (the memory) occurred a week or so ago and I can still recall it now feels huge."

DID,fkx27f8,t3_fkyvlg,1584615983.0,"It’s hard to ever know if a symptom matters or not isn’t it? Somatic stuff is so real and can look like a fever or a heart attack and all sorts of stuff that we should worry about ... I can’t tell the difference between somatic pain and not somatic “real” pain because it seems the same.
- we gave birth at home accidentally once because we didn’t believe we were really in labour and we’re too scared we’d be wrong and just imagining the pain was actually bad... I’m WAY too terrified to ever go to the ER or even the GP and potentially be really embarrassed because they think I’m faking it and it’s all in my head or that I’m just a giant wuss. I think I’d only go if I broke my arm and could see the bone or something as proof.
I hope you feel better and the fever goes away soon.

DID,fklih1p,t3_fj80qu,1584306995.0,"Wow. That is several levels of fucked up. I’m so sorry you were treated that way!!! 
Firstly, your physical problem still needs to be addressed, like how is kicking you out helping you? I spoke to a women recently who’s got stage 4 cancer - she had been complaining of symptoms for TWO YEARS but because she has a mental illness, nobody did any tests until recently and now it’s too late.
Your issue has some solutions, things that can help and yet they are choosing not to!!

Secondly- just generally, WTF?! Ugh!! I’m so angry for you >:(

Also, not to mention that doctor should not have told anyone else about the disclosure of DID, it’s not even related to the problem in this instance so it’s nobody’s business.
I get really concerned about dr/patient confidentiality at the best of times and I really do wonder how that fits in in a hospital setting, like are the rules different because they are a treatment “team”? 

Ugh. ((Hugs))"
DID,fkaar0j,t3_fh4b0p,1583999361.0,"The part we have like this... I’ll call her B...she doesn’t act on anything herself (not yet at least) but does very strongly influence other parts, in particular an ex host who attempted suicide and acted out self harm because B essentially commanded her to...

Now I know more about our system dynamics I know B was a trauma holder when we were small, I actually speculate she was terrified of dying as a kid and I think she decided suicide meant impending death was in her control and if she proclaimed she wanted to die enough times it kind of “took the power away” from abusers.

She also instigated an eating disorder but I believe it started as an attempt to help - misguided protecting - we were bullied for being overweight in school so I think she thought not eating would protect us from the bullying and punishing us for eating would be somehow motivating... 

It’s just she kinda became super abusive towards other system members in the process and that continued into adulthood and became very destructive. She’s also age stuck now at around 13 - when we discovered that she was still quite young it helped reduce her influence significantly. 
She’s just a scared kid who desperately needs therapy (we’re trying to encourage her to front there) and I can have compassion for her because of this - others in our system are still extremely angry about the suicide attempt though, healing takes time. 

I guess what I’m saying is trying to find compassion but being firm with boundaries is important (varies in difficulty depending on your communication abilities) but sometimes even accepting them as misguided parts who deserve love from a distance can help reduce the power they have over the system."
DID,fk6oj42,t1_fk4g3e8,1583909297.0,"Agreed, I feel we are all so used to hiding that the sudden exposure feels super threatening :-("
DID,fk6mvxj,t3_fgm70w,1583907455.0,"If you’re forced to go back...
Bring it up with the therapist. Just say something outright along the lines of:

 “I feel like we aren’t communicating very well, I feel like you either don’t believe what I’m telling you about my experiences or that you don’t understand the things I am experiencing or my explanations of them.”

You could also try adding:
“I understand that the way I experience the world is different to many others and so Is there anything you would like me to clarify about my perceptions before we continue?”

And stuff like:
“it’s important for me at this stage of my healing journey for you to understand that i experience the world as part of a system, I can’t just ‘turn it off’ because it is as natural to me as breathing. This is going to make me harder to treat than other clients you might have, if you are not comfortable or you feel you are not going to be able to help me, then that is ok BUT we need to establish that now so that we don’t waste each other’s time and so I am able to seek therapy from a different provider”


I hope you find a resolution everyone can live with

AskDID,fk4y70r,t3_fgj1vk,1583869877.0,"We have had this happen, I had a thing one time where I felt like I’d been p*ssessed by two of the others apparently wanting to have a random conversation and I was basically just the scribe go between, it felt weirdly automated and like they were purely using me for my fingers to type in a passive influence kind of way.

I wasn’t able to think about or react to their ‘conversation’ as it happened and I wasn’t really aware of what they were writing afterwards, I struggled to read it- I’d just forget what I’d read again almost immediately - like I wasn’t ‘allowed’ to read it.
I’m not sure why they didn’t just talk to each other inside, it happened earlyish in my own discovery of the system so maybe they couldn’t or were trying to prove themselves to me or someone else somehow, although I think the conversation was kinda personal between the two of them... IDK.

I still have it somewhere I think. They didn’t swap text colour or anything there’s just a gap between paragraphs- bit hard to decipher where one starts and ends in some points. 

There are times I’ll write a blog post or something then realise afterwards it was somehow dictated to me rather than coming from me - like, it’ll be about a situation I have a totally different perspective about and it’s written way better than I have the ability to write."

AskDID,fjx3dq2,t1_fjwnq82,1583654854.0,"We have co morbid bipolar disorder with psychotic features, and it definitely seems to affect us in different ways and severity levels. The baseline personality of one of us is generally more “hypomanic” so if we have an actual bipolar manic episode, when she fronts she seems to experience far stronger mania bordering on psychosis whereas other parts are still very hypomanic but they don’t pose the same social and physical safety risk to Us that her behaviour does.

Another part feels depressed as a baseline so depressive episodes affect her much more strongly and she is a serious suicide risk at those times. while the rest of us vary in the depth and effects of the depressive episode. 
 
We also have one particular part that seems to nearly always be in a state of psychosis, I have considered perhaps they only front if We as a whole reach a level of mania or depression that triggers psychosis, Except on at least one occasion we have been considered in a full hallucinating delusional psychosis when she was fronting, suddenly switched  and part then fronting was mood affected but with no psychotic symptoms at all.
