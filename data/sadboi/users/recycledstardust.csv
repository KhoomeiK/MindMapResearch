LockdownSkepticism,fomj2ti,t3_g74m7r,1587891897.0,"I live in LA and worked on a set in mid-March for about a week.

During that week and for about a week after, I felt a little under the weather. The fatigue seemed pretty normal because I was working 12 hour days in the pouring rain. At one point I did develop some shortness of breath/weird feeling when breathing, and my throat was dry enough to bleed a little bit. I ignored this and it eventually went away. 

I got an e-mail that one of my fellow production assistants tested positive for CV19 but was recovering fine. I worked closely and hands-on with every production assistant so I’m wondering if perhaps I did have it and then gave it to him, or if he gave it to me, or if I didn’t even have it in the first place. It could’ve been seasonal allergies (which I think I’m being affected by right now, because I’m a bit congested). 

I’m not sure where I stand on the whole lockdown issue, but anecdotally everything has been fine with me and my circle so I’m glad for that."
college,foh9mly,t3_g6w7hj,1587762324.0,"I studied abroad for only 6 weeks in the summer of my junior year of college.

I had a horrible, horrible time. This might’ve been unique to me, but I want to tell you my story anyway just in case it helps. 

I’m someone who really values being close to friends, having support, and having normalcy. Going abroad meant I was totally separate from my friends, all while not speaking the language and knowing no one. I was also in a relationship and I missed him a lot. Every day I was there, I considered the pros and cons of booking a flight home. I spent a long time crying and my host mom thought I was rude because I didn’t come out of my room a lot. 

During the study abroad trip, I was placed along with lots of other students who I had a hard time vibing with. They always wanted to go out and party, which was totally fine for a while. But then I got a cold and couldn’t go out, and quickly everyone stopped being my friend. There was a ton of focus on exploration and having fun and being super energetic all the time, which was exhausting. This may have been because it was a shorter trip instead of a whole semester, but I would keep it in mind. 

The language barrier can be isolating as well. It’s hard to really feel comfortable and let your guard down when you constantly have to be thinking about how to get a basic point across. Luckily technology can help a lot with this, but again it’s hard to feel truly connected. 

I don’t regret traveling on vacations. Vacations are amazing because they’re a short period of time and there’s that “newness” factor and you get to sightsee without it getting old. I very much enjoyed seeing a glimpse of the culture, trying new foods, visiting museums and landmarks, and just exploring. But it would’ve been nicer knowing that there was an end in sight where things would go back to “normal.” I do regret going abroad because it cost a lot of money and damaged my mental health at the time. If your mental health is generally pretty stable then I would say go for it, but if you have issues then take them into consideration. 

I hope this helped!"

I’m curious as to why your GP says it isn’t severe enough to treat. When I first had issues with sexual pain, I went to a few gynecologists who claimed it was just a yeast infection and dismissed my claims that it was incredibly painful even after many yeast infection treatments. It was only when I got a FOURTH opinion that I finally started getting treated for the true issue. I’d recommend that you see a specialist if you’re able. Sexual pleasure is IMPORTANT and it pisses me off that doctors tried to pass it off as not a big deal.

This hurts so bad because my mom was heli mom in terms of my personality growing up. No matter how hard I tried socially, I could never be as outgoing as her, so she’d shame me for shyness. Always wishing I was someone different.  But my dad was always on my side, I guess because I was getting good grades and attending a great school. I’m adopted so I’ve lost my bio parents, then my adoptive mom, and it’s sad to lose my adoptive dad too. But low communication seems like the best option for my sanity right now, or else I’ll spend my entire life waiting for him to be proud of me.

Broadway,esk9na0,t1_esju6ux,1562056366.0,"When you say it’ll mellow out by the fall...does that mean that if I want to see it in fall (October) I should wait until like August to buy them? Or even later? 

Not sure if my question makes sense or if it’s answerable, I’ve just never purchased Broadway tickets but this show seems like something I’d 100% love."
AskReddit,es7ay28,t1_es6nvlr,1561667242.0,"Definitely. My dad does EVERYTHING for my mom and my mom puts him down and is super controlling. I had a lot of those tendencies when dating as a teen, I’m working on fixing them now. Sometimes I feel myself sliding back into it and I hate that about myself."
AskReddit,es6lxc5,t1_es68o6b,1561652269.0,"God, I hated the “suddenly pulling the door open” game my mom would play. I startle easily so several times a day I’d be in a panic. Even if I wasn’t doing anything bad, it made me paranoid. To this day I try to make a lot of footstep noise when walking toward a roommate’s room before opening it because I don’t want to scare them or make them feel intruded upon like my mom did."
blackmirror,eqkpuo7,t1_eqcea0w,1560128547.0,"Seriously. Social media during emergencies can be a MESS. A few years back there was a murder-suicide of a Professor by a former student on my campus. Really sad, but it wasn’t a “school shooting” in the sense that this former student wanted to go around killing tons of people. There were two shots and everyone was on lockdown. 

During the lockdown, rumors spread that it was a terrorist attack, that there were four active shooters, one in each corner of the campus, one was a woman and three men. This was COMPLETELY untrue and sent so many people into an absolute panic for hours over an event that, in truth, happened in the timespan of a few seconds."
blackmirror,eqkhkps,t1_eq82gco,1560123416.0,"I feel this. I don’t believe humans have evolved with the capacity to care for everyone. For ages and ages, we lived in small tribes and villages, so it made sense to care for everyone. It was POSSIBLE to care for everyone. But now with transportation, globalization, and especially social media...I’m hearing on Instagram about disgusting atrocities happening across the world the moment I wake up. I don’t need that in my day. I wish I didn’t read such a graphic description of it. But I feel like an asshole if I try to emotionally distance myself or not care."
blackmirror,eqkh7yh,t1_eqj2epf,1560123192.0,"I’m sorry this happened to you. You’re medicated and are monitoring on your mental health, which I’d argue is “safer” in terms of hiring than someone who is undiagnosed and refusing any help. 

I thought the episode really emphasized it with the whole “psych team” telling him how to handle the situation. I’m trained in counseling and sometimes my coworkers sound so formulaic - I’m really trying to break out of that and still keep the principles while also being a human. It’s a tough balance and I liked when Billy Bauer was like “fuck dude, I don’t know” cause sometimes people tell you something that’s a LOT to handle and words can’t really help."
SkincareAddiction,epy1kuc,t1_epy1e26,1559616676.0,"Good to hear - hopefully my skin will clear up as well at some point.

Luckily I haven't experienced mood issues on Yaz (at this point, at least). I feel like it actually stabilizes me in a lot of ways. But I know everyone has different results so I'm just continuing and hoping for the best.

&#x200B;

Thank you!"
SkincareAddiction,epy17in,t1_epy0mt0,1559616386.0,"Wow, that's really interesting that it's the same exact brand.

So are you saying that you had to discontinue Yaz and then 3 weeks later it cleared up? Or that you continued taking it and it cleared up on its own?"
AskReddit,epvpzpp,t1_epvhq9k,1559544523.0,Does it help if you already process language fast and are already sort of fast at typing on a typical keyboard (I think I type about 85 words per minute)? Or is the steno theory/language completely different from typical typing?
WTF,eoiqa21,t1_eoiln51,1558625115.0,"I’m not so sure it’s “for the gram” as much, it’s just easier to do hip thrusts efficiently (since the bar is padded and you don’t have to spend time loading the bar and finding a space and all that). I don’t personally use this machine for hip thrusts because I feel weird doing it, but I can see why someone would."
AskReddit,eo8qyjd,t1_eo8aay4,1558372890.0,"I have a similar story, although luckily I caught it at 20. Vitamin deficiency can make you feel unbelievably bad, I never realized how much of a fog I lived in until I started taking the vitamins I was deficient in (same ones as you). I felt like there was a wall between other people and me - I couldn’t figure out how other people had so much energy and life, how they could stay awake for things. For years I thought I was depressed and I tried meds for that before giving up. 

They were about to test for narcolepsy (a pretty expensive test) because I was so tired all the time, until I suggested a blood test first. They were SURE it was narcolepsy but did the blood test just in case. Within months of starting vitamins, I can actually stay awake for things, I haven’t fallen asleep in an unwanted place since."
