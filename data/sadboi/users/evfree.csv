CPTSD,fqu14ms,t1_fqtc9j3,1589649993.0,"Yes, me too!  The extreme fawn response has been crazy for me.  I’ve gotten into some really scary situations.  As they are developing, I keep thinking “this doesn’t seem right” but I keep smiling/ playing along with a relaxed body posture, like I can’t let on that I know things are weird in the moment.  

I just want to freeze somewhere safe, in large part so I can process the situation and understand how best to proceed safely.  But I can’t because I’m still in the interaction.  Like I can’t figure out how to safely stop the interaction/steer it in an OK direction for myself when I’m emotionally and energetically caught up in the interaction.  And sometimes ( though thank goodness rarely) the fawning led to things feeling lovely and an abusive relationship cycle.  I wish I had a magic pause button.

I think that’s why I’m afraid to post or comment.  I don’t want to get trapped in that cycle.  I want Reddit to be a safe social place that makes me feel happier.  I don’t want the anxiety of more conflict.

I am currently stuck in freeze mode regarding 2 DMs that resulted from a comment exchange.
I’m sure the guy is an ok person, but I didn’t feel heard and he felt very demanding.  

That’s been enough to trigger me into... some type of freeze/flight combo for the last week or so.  I have not read the, I’m sure, perfectly nice and polite DMs from someone I feel is projecting an image on to me.  Freaks me out and I get stuck.

I get a jolt of  fear every time I log in and see the red #2 of those unread DMs.  I avoided Reddit for a day or so.  Now I’m back in and try to keep my eyes and fingers from the middle of the screen.

No wonder our energy gets sapped.  Regardless, so far I am refusing to delete my downvoted comments.  I am a nice person with a decent heart and brain.  As long as my heart and head are in the right place, and as long as I’m open to listening to others, I’m trusting my viewpoint still has value even if it’s rare."

I was 17 and he was 35.  I finally managed to end it when I was 21.  I was deeply damaged, and took most of my 20’s off from dating because I was terrified of repeating the same relationship dynamics.

Abusive relationships don’t start off feeling bad.  Otherwise, you’d never get in the relationship in the first place.  Instead, the person first pretends to be/ do whatever they think will work to cement the relationship.  Then, gradually, you become more and more isolated from genuine friends and family, your boundaries get pushed little by little, they gradually (and sometimes very subtlety if they are especially skilled) increase their role in your life and their control over you. 

I was a deeply unhappy 17 year old, and I blamed all my problems on my parents at the time.  This great relationship with an older guy who (seemingly) had life all figured out seemed to be my ticket out of misery.  The beginning/grooming phase was a lot of fun; I had no idea and couldn’t see the problem.

If you are over 26, I’m not as worried about age gaps.  Younger than that, and it’s a huge red flag.  I couldn’t see it while I was in it.  

I’ve since learned that my unhappiness, past trauma and co-dependent patterns made me vulnerable to be a target of this type of predator.

If I had gotten pregnant, would I have stayed in the relationship longer?  Almost certainly."

I think you’re right to pursue electrolysis.  I haven’t just because of the cost.  It floors me that I can’t use hsa money for it.  I agree that this takes a huge toll on mental health and, for me at least, seemed to put me at odds with my gender and made m feel like I wasn’t able to fully live as I wanted to.

Here’s what I learned so far:
Spironolactone (sp?) is prescribed sometimes for this.  It’s a serious drug that freaked my pcp out.  Do your research and proceed with caution.  I went on it for a little while and it did help, but not enough to risk my long-term health.

Stress, health, nutrition, exercise and sleep matter.  Some mornings I have less growth than others. Sometimes, it seems related to lower stress.

Plucking may make it worse ( according to my electrolysis consult).

Some guys are deeply bothered by it.  Some don’t seem to care as much.  I shave daily, and hid that fact for the first year we lived together.  I’m open with my bf about it now, and he doesn’t seem bothered by it.  This isn’t your fault, and you don’t need to feel ashamed of your own body.  Our bodies are beautiful 💕💕💕"

I’ve since come to understand that our feelings and inner beliefs drive our actions through our perceptions.

I didn’t come to these beliefs about myself in a vacuum.

I was also sick all the time.  I kept getting worse.
I started thinking about my micro-biome.  How does our emotional experience affect our microbiome?  The reverse? What kind of universe did I want to be for them?  Could I be less sick?

Even though I hated myself, I was able to choose love for my micro-biome.  When talking to myself, berating myself, or feeling pain, I would pause and say to myself “In this universe, we choose love.”

I’m still a work in progress, but after a couple years of this, I realized I didn’t hate myself anymore.  I continue to practice self love and release trauma.

A few years ago, I went to a psychic who said something like “You could have had a much happier life than you do now.  You have a lot of darkness and need a lot of healing.  You don’t have the ability to heal yourself, you understand?  I’m special and I have the ability to heal you.”

Not only is this attitude bullshit, I think it’s dangerous.  I’ve since come to embrace that it is our earthly mission to go inside and heal ourselves.  Like, a really big mission for all of us, that it’s part of our purpose of being on earth.  I don’t trust those who say otherwise.

It’s wonderful to get help and I’ve found healing sessions helpful, but my perspective has shifted on healing.  I have the responsibility and power to heal, and I will step-by-step pursue healing and (next step?) my purpose on this planet."

AmItheAsshole,fmhqoxj,t1_fmhpvu9,1586090592.0,"Oh, that’s a great insight, thanks!  So some of the desire to punish is going to the little sister because she’s accessible and easy to punish?
There is some direct anger towards her, but there is also some redirected anger from bf to her because it is actually possible to punish her when it’s not possible to punish the bf.  That helps me understand.  Thank you."
AmItheAsshole,fmho825,t1_fmhfb7g,1586088118.0,"I mean, yes?  Who knows the bf is only cheating with the sister?  Could have been/be anyone.  Makes it way worse that it’s OP’s sister.  But it sounds like you’re saying it’s little sister’s fault the bf cheated.  

To take the little sis is responsible for the bf’s cheating to an extreme:  “Poor bf!  Slutty little sister convinced him to cheat on OP and ruin bf’s and op’s perfectly good relationship!”  

I think we have a cultural pattern of blaming the other woman.  I’ve seen that pattern lessen over the years, but it’s strong in this thread.  I suspect that’s due to the outrage and the sister’s behavior, but that doesn’t make it right."
AmItheAsshole,fmhnbx2,t1_fmhjck2,1586087162.0,"Thanks!  I think people are so outraged at the idea of the little sister cheating that she’s taking more than her fair share of the blame, shame, trauma and damage for the situation.  People are so mad, they don’t seem to see the bf’s responsibility too."
AmItheAsshole,fmhe01n,t1_fmhdsty,1586076252.0,"She didn’t cost OP her home though.  The bf did that.  OP would have needed to leave regardless of who he cheated with.  Again, not saying the sister is in the clear by a long shot.  But it’s not all on her."

AmItheAsshole,fmhceln,t1_fmh9m6l,1586074469.0,"Yes, and she’s 19!  That needs to be taken into consideration too.  She made wrong choices, but that doesn’t mean she should lose her home and family, and forced to rely on the a-hole who gets with someone‘a little sister. ESH"

In the meantime, self-care. Epsom salt baths (or just salt if that’s what you have), good food, time and support for sleep, time in nature, exercise, etc.  Especially rough time to process something like this with social distancing.  You will heal your soul and be whole again.  Don’t give up, we need you ❤️❤️❤️"

I saw a cloud of...dimming shadow? Try to roll into my house a few days ago.  It was like if someone dimmed the lights, put into cloud form, rolling into my house.  It was huge, at least 20 feet wide.  It didn’t feel ok and it felt connected to the virus, but I’m not sure how.  Didn’t feel like anything else I’ve experienced before.  I’m not sure why but I started singing at it.  It held in place for 20 seconds or so and then it eventually drew back.  Weird.  Idk"
