Anxiety,fr19hjz,t3_gm399i,1589815760.0,"I do the same thing, I think it’s pretty common with anxiety issues. I was thinking I may have Irritable Bowl Syndrome and I read people with that usually have anxiety and vice versa. 

I found it helpful to have a more fiber rich diet, I’d really like to take fiber pills to ensure I get a healthy amount each day but I haven’t been able to ask a doctor that yet and it’s dangerous to start taking any kind of pills without a doctor involved. 

This last bit might make you feel better, I know it did me when I first heard but I read that the reason anxiety and stomach problems are linked so closely is because during your fight or flight response your body slows down blood flow to less essential parts of your body so you have more to spare for you more essential parts used while fighting or running (ie heart, lungs etc.) and your intestines are one of the organs your body slows blood flow for and that’s the reason our stomachs/digestive system gets messed up from anxiety!"

Echo for PS4, an indie stealth game that’s criminally underrated. 

The Deadly Tower of Monsters, also an indie game, gameplay isn’t great but the whole all story and aesthetic is one of a kind and it blew my mind. 

Virginia, this one I’m sure a lot of people won’t like considering it’s a “walking simulator” but the metaphorical and symbolic nature of the game made it interesting to play through and watch, reminded me of 2001 A Space Odyssey

I always go back and forth on which is my favorite, I don’t have a whole lot of experience with the series. 

I normally say FF7 Crisis Core because that was the first one that I really got into but some days I feel like 13 is my favorite because that was the first one I played on console, all though never got to finish because my PS3 broke. (Also technically the original FF7 on PS1 was the first one I played on console but I was a kid and didn’t know what to do or understood the story at all. I did finally recently play it on PS4 and it was hella good, have not played the remake though.) 

And lastly, I think the first game that really caught my attention was 12 (that’s the one with the judges right?) my friend had it and I remember being mesmerized by it but sadly never got to play it myself. I think if I did it might be my favorite. 

Other than those the only FF games I played was the original 3 on GBA, that was my first real experience with the series and honestly I hated them."
