This is the most rational approach to dating I've ever seen. If more people did this, they wouldn't be so stressed and anxious about the whole process. The games people feel obligated to play are totally unnecessary and do significantly more harm than good, I just wish more people had your attitude. 

That said, I think game playing has become ingrained in the younger generations through being exposed to social media and influencer culture during very formative years, so I can understand why they cling to it, but do think everyone should relax when it comes to dating. A person's life shouldn't hinge on it, but a lot of people behave as if it does.

2) Embrace failure and mistakes. You're very young, so this is life advice as well as writing advice, honestly. You're going to make a lot of mistakes, naturally. Learn from your mistakes, don't regret them.

mentalhealth,fms2r2l,t3_fx2dfp,1586344622.0,"Frankly, there isn't much you can do regarding socialisation right now, so it'd be preferable to handle mental health in other ways. 

The practises everyone know about are things like meditating, exercising (watch some calisthenics videos on YouTube or do jumping jacks, that sort of thing, really anything will work) and journal/diary writing, eating healthily, sleeping enough etc. So I'd recommend you try all of them. 

If you went to a psychiatrist, they'd also recommend practises like very basic to-do lists. Throw on things you do every day anyway, alongside any new practises you want to take up, like ""brush teeth, eat breakfast, meditate for 10 minutes"", etc. They'd also recommend what's called - where I come from, anyway - a ""thought sheet"". For the sake of simplicity, I'll explain its general purpose. Whenever you feel particularly negative, it encourages you to ask yourself why you feel this way, if it makes sense to feel this way given the context, evidence both for and against this and a conclusion. The purpose of this is to get you more in-tune with your emotions and realise what is bad for you and why it's bad for you. This way, you can take more charge over your thoughts, actions and emotions. Which leads me into a core principle of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) - thoughts affect actions affect behaviour. Before the quarantine, I was talking to a health psychologist I work with. At the moment, she's studying the effects of optimism and pessimism on recovery from significant illness, and as expected, that core CBT principle above is quite impactful. The example she gave me regarding her work was a person who is optimistic about their recovery will have hope, so behave in kind. They will get up each morning, shower, eat breakfast, go for a walk, etc. The individual who is pessimistic about their recovery won't have any hope so won't bother getting up early, won't taking care of themselves or pursuing their hobbies. What you should learn from this is the way you frame things in your thoughts can totally change your perspective. A quote from Seneca, an eminent Greek philosopher, which I adore is, ""man is not affected by events, but by the view he takes of them.""

In your case, I'd also highly recommend a routine. Routine is universally beneficial. Set a time to wake up each morning and stick to it, no matter what. If you can get out of bed when the alarm goes off, you've essentially won the day. Set a schedule for yourself, fill it with things to do and do them. Study, exercise, read a book, draw or write, whatever you feel is productive. 

These are hard times for a lot of people and you're definitely not alone in how you feel, so if this wall of text helps you or anyone else even the smallest bit, then I'm satisfied.

I mean, what's the purpose of writing if not to make the reader feel something? 

The only reasonable criticisms I can think of really come down to its length. I found the sentence structure a bit janky, very 'list-y'. It felt like a list of events rather than an emotive story, but I blame that on the story's length. I'd love to see some longer work of yours.

A natural reaction to feelings like yours is to try and find labels to identify with, so you feel like you have an understanding of it, your questions have answers. But to be honest, a lot of people display traits which, individually, are symptomatic of mental illness, but lack companions to make any real diagnosis. In other words, a lot of people aren't mentally ill, but do display traits of it. It's like, say, cycling a bike at speed and then falling and your shoulder takes the impact. Your shoulder might hurt like hell, you may not be able to move it, but it isn't broken. Chances are it's dislocated at worst. I hope that makes sense.

You can't just take psychiatric medication ""on and off"" I'm afraid. It simply does not work that way. Psychiatric medication does not work like a painkiller or antibiotic. It takes several weeks, at least, to begin making a noticeable effect and is only prescribed to moderate - severe mental health issues. 

In your case, you'd be recommended breathing exercises or even a short course of cognitive behavioural therapy by a psychotherapist or psychiatrist to teach you anxiety management skills. Certainly try breathing exercises, meditation and observation tests (detaching from the situation, analysing it and judging how rational your fear is).

When in an unconscious or comatose state, your brain is simply keeping the body functioning. Sleep is an extremely complex state with numerous processes occurring within the body and brain.

In simple terms, the ""rested"" feeling you're describing is the result of a complex chemical exchange in the brain. Throughout the day, adenosine builds up in the brain. When your ""internal clock"" detects the change in light in your environment (day turning to night) this triggers the release of melatonin which prepares the body to sleep. What actually makes you tired and sleepy is the level of adenosine in your brain. During sleep, the adenosine is ""washed out"" of the brain. This sudden shift from the drowsy and lethargic effect adenosine has on the brain to the clarity and altertness of its absence is what produces the ""rested"" feeling. No process associated with sleep occurs when you are unconscious or comatose.

So as cliché as it sounds, I can promise it does get better. It's very difficult to realise that there is light at the end of the tunnel when you're in the fucking tunnel, but there is. Everything in life is ephemeral, it's all brief in the grand scheme of things and it does end. That includes illness and despair. It can be easy and even kind of comforting to believe that there's no hope and dying is better. But there's a lot more to life than just suffering. 

**When you've hit rock bottom, it's essential to pay attention to the small things.** Eating properly, showering, getting out of bed, etc, are all significant victories when you're on your last legs. 

Below, I've listed out some basic things which people underestimate and can dramatically improve your mood and general health, especially when in the situation you are.

1. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, drugs and smoking. They can offer temporary relief, but also depress your mood and damage your health, they can be catastrophic in the mid-long term. 
2. Eat a healthy diet. Your financial situation and anorexia will affect this, and I understand that. Your financial situation especially is a factor that cannot be fixed, so we need to work around it. This isn't a biology class, so I'll recommend some foods and diet ideas and if you're interested, I'll go into the details about how these things help you in point 3, because I do believe once you know what you're working with, you can actively help yourself. So try to eat fish, whole grains, bananas, chicken, pasta, eggs, low-fat cheese and low-fat yogurt, beans and green vegetables. And for the love of God, **drink lots of water.** 
3. *Okay I promised in point 2 I'd go over the details of what this food does to improve your mood, so if you're not interested, move on to point 4.* Whole grains improve mood because they give your body high levels of carbohydrates. This increases serotonin production, improving mood. Fish has very high levels of omega-3, fatty acids and selenium - all of which increase serotonin production.  Tryptophan, a chemical which also increases serotonin production, is found in all protein-rich foods, such as chicken. However, you should also consume tryptophan-rich foods with carbohydrates, because of other complicating factors which I'm not getting into here. You also want to consume folic acid, found in a variety of beans, green vegetables and even orange juice. 
4. **I cannot stress how important it is to sleep properly.** If I went through sleep thoroughly, I'd end up writing a book on neuroscience here. Sleep is essential to virtually everything we need to function and perform, but in your case, it will dramatically improve mood stabilisation, appetite, energy levels, reduce anxiety and generally improve health and functioning. Try to sleep without the aid of sleeping pills, as (once again, extremely complex topic I'm not getting into) they disrupt the quality of your sleep a lot. Try to avoid any artificial light such as laptop, phone or TV screens about an hour before sleep. Also practise something that calms you down, such as reading, drawing or listening to music. Do this consistently. This will help your body form a rhythm and it will detect the ritual every night and automatically prepare itself for sleep, making it easier to sleep and giving higher quality sleep. 
5. **Drink some more water.**
6. **Attempt to exercise every day, even if it's just a 10 minute walk, exercise is extremely beneficial.** I'll go into some particulars here for the same reason I did with food. Exercise is among the biggest favours you can do yourself, especially when mentally ill. Exercise will not only provide a task you can focus on, accomplishing it also gives you a victory at the end. Exercise will produce serotonin and endorphins in your brain, both of which can relieve stress and improve your mood. In addition, exercise helps you in a variety of physical, emotional and cognitive ways. Try to aim for relaxing exercise, such as walking, but if you feel up to it, try more intensive exercise, like running, cycling or going to the gym. 
7. **Keep up to speed on sanitation.** Make a priority of showering, brushing your teeth, washing your hair, washing your hands, wearing freshly-washed clothes, etc. Sanitation is important to physical health (being physically unhealthy can harm psychological health) and being clean, looking good, improves self-esteem, self-image, confidence and mood. 
8. **Mindfulness is highly beneficial for emotional well-being. Practise it.** Meditating for even 5 minutes every day, journaling, taking peaceful walks. These are all amazing for mental well-being. I'd also encourage you to take up drawing, painting or writing. They all give you something to focus on, help develop goal-oriented behaviour and give an outlet for expression and catharsis. Meditation can be boring at first, but if you can push through that initial boredom, the benefits are immeasurable. As for journaling - always journal with a goal in mind. Don't do it arbitrarily. Use it to reflect. Write about a particular idea and be as honest as possible with yourself. 
9. **Drink even more water.**
10. **Socialise, socialise, socialise.** Social interaction is essential in maintaining physical and mental health, but especially mental. Speaking with people is a powerful tool in improving mood and reducing stress. Like I did with food, I'll get into the science in part 11, if you're interested. Try joining clubs, societies, go out more often with friends, ring up an old friend. Anything that involves social interaction and offers opportunities to meet new people. Socialising will make you feel less lonely, more secure and if you have a support network, that'll go a long way to improving mood and coping ability. Socialising releases a chemical called oxytocin, which activates your parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for calming you down. This helps you reduce anxiety, stress and improve mood. Feeling wanted also improves confidence and self-esteem. So go out, say hello to random people on the street, give cashiers simple comments about the weather, talk to neighbours a little more. Any and all social interaction will help build your confidence, self-esteem and release all those feel-good chemicals. 

That's all I have for you, for now. I could get way more technical and offer more advanced techniques, but I'd only do that if I thought it'd really help you or if you were interested. Feel free to DM me at any time, don't be shy, you won't inconvenience me. And if you have any more questions, want to talk or anything like that, I'm all ears. 

I wish you all the best, and remember, everything passes, including illness. Have a good day and keep your head up!"

And a wild card:

You say you're open to everything, so I definitely recommend checking out 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami. One of the most unique and interesting stories I've ever seen.

I also recommend The Supernova Era by Cixin Liu. Very existential and poignant book, even kinda disturbing at times."
horror,fc31csg,t3_efvz3y,1577379216.0,"I'm honestly not too optimistic about this. I like Nicolas Cage, but his movies are really hit and miss. I'm moderately excited to see a potentially good adaptation of The Colour Out of Space (one of my favourites by Lovecraft, I mean, who doesn't love it?), but I'll try remain realistic.

Edit: Anyone waiting for Horror at Red Hook and Pickman's Model adaptations...?"

writing,fc30e7z,t3_efvuhm,1577378595.0,"It could be neurological, a genetic disposition, or even intelligence.

Proficiency in a task improves as you practise because the brain creates more and more neural pathways  which translate in real-world terms as getting better at the task, because your brain has more resources to work with.

Intelligence could also play a role. The actual definition of intelligence is one's capacity for acquiring, understanding and applying new information. As such, more intelligent people become more adept at tasks at a faster rate.

Then the genetic disposition theory. A significant part of the personality is hereditary (although I'm getting into the nature/nurture, naturalist/empiricist debate here), for example, if your grandfather was quite a good writer, you may ''inherit'' his ''ability to write'', per se.

None of this is fact, the above are just my hypotheses as a psychology student and writer. Hope I helped? Regardless, happy writing!

Edit: Reading some other comments, people bring up some very good points. Talent isn't everything and I firmly trust practise and experience above talent."
mentalhealth,fc2z7dv,t1_fc2wrbf,1577377828.0,"I getcha totally with that need for quiet time, that wind down phase of the night. Have you spoken to your husband about how you feel about the new dynamic?"
writers,fc2y8pf,t1_fc2sjsa,1577377198.0,"This is an incredible point. I'd rather spend a few hours working to 1k high quality words, rather than 5k words of crap. That said, keep in mind that editing and revision is the magic cure to all crappiness."
writers,fc2xyy4,t3_efvsa3,1577376999.0,"I'd never try to force a word count on a chapter. Let it be as long or short as it needs to be. Some chapters are more essential or deal with heavier or more sprawling conflicts/topics than others, so require a higher word count. Others aren't quite as imposing and may only need a small word count. 

However, you mentioned that your story is broken into parts, which I'm assuming would either a) include multiple chapters, or b) be significantly longer than the average ''chapter''. In that case, I think it really depends on a few factors. 

1. Do you want every part to be approximately the same length, or are you allowing it to vary?
2. How you structure the story as a whole; how many parts are required to tell the story?
3. How you structure each part; do you have a particular structure for each part in mind, or do you just take each part as you find it? 
4. This one ties back to point (1) - how important is the conflict in the part? A part with a major plot point (in a story where part lengths vary)  may be longer than a part that does not feature very important conflict. 

I'm sorry that I didn't give you a concrete, simple answer for how long parts should be, but that's because I really don't believe in forcing a word count on anything, I think it restricts the story's authenticity. Strict word counts do have merit, but for the most part, I don't like them, so I thought it would be better to offer some tools to help you decide the optimal word count yourself, especially in conjunction with the word comments. 

Hope you sort your problem out, and happy writing!"
socialskills,fc2x1w6,t3_efsz1f,1577376309.0,"Well done! You're not overreacting at all, celebrate every victory, including the small ones. Keep it up :)"
mentalhealth,ex6z7g4,t3_crlmiq,1566053749.0,"I can't hypothesise much about your condition because there's so many factors that contribute to mental illness that this simply needs to be done in person. 

If you feel that the issues you've mentioned above affect your life negatively or even prevent you from living a happy/fulfilling life, then I would absolutely recommend you see a medical professional. Depending on the diagnosis, the type of medical professional would vary, but I think in your case, a psychiatrist isn't necessary. 

TL;DR If you feel that your life is deeply, negatively affected by the issues you stated above, I'd recommend you see a psychotherapist."
KeepWriting,ex6vpdq,t3_cricr5,1566052195.0,"The three best pieces of advice I can give any writer - especially a young writer - are; write every day, read every day and never be afraid of what people might think of your work, putting it out there and getting criticism is one of the best ways to improve. 

Your word choices are very effective and sentence lengths are very good. They create a slow pacing and calm atmosphere. However, the piece does involve a lot of 'action jumping'. Consecutive sentences just describing mundane actions can slow the writing a lot, make it clunky, and can be cut or compressed. This section is a particularly good example of this:

''She opened her eyes, they were ‘a delicate jade green’ as her mother had once described. The jades sleepily scanned the room; she was awestruck. After a moment, a feeling similar to nostalgia rushed over her. She knew she had never been here before, but never had she felt more at home. She admired the dark, forest green plaster decorating the upper-half of the wall whereas the baseboard was dark-oak, matching the flooring.'' 

Starting a sentence with a mundane action like ''she opened her eyes'' or ''she admired'', is  clunky. It is okay to do this occasionally, but in consecutive sentences, it can be a problem. However, I did love the line ''The jades sleepily scanned the room'', it created a very nice, calm, nostalgic feeling and was a simply interesting way to say 'she looked around the room'. Good job there. 

Another descriptive point for writing in general; when you're editing, ask yourself about an action line 'is this relevant? Does the reader need to know of this action?' This will help tremendously with cutting word count and making the piece smoother and generally better. 

This piece is actually quite good for your age. Most people can't write this well at 12/13, you are definitely showing a lot of promise, so keep it up. I hope this little critique piece helped you, and good luck in your future writing."

mentalhealth,ewg6j90,t3_co1y9u,1565374984.0,"Being someone who has had experience with mental health services and is going on to study psychology to become a psychotherapist, it's actually great that you've come this far. You have access to medication and a therapist.

So, social anxiety is a very common and treatable problem, but it can be very difficult to live with, I have experience. Sertraline is quite a suitable medication option, for both depression and social anxiety. Definitely stick with it.

As for your therapy, you should absolutely bring your depression up with your therapist and make it clear that it's your main concern. Any good therapist would not dismiss your concerns and would be very open to your thoughts.

I would also suggest picking up new hobbies. If you don't already read or exercise, they're quite good for treating depression. Even just some light reading or a ten minute walk every day will do wonders. Setting up a schedule for yourself also helps quite a lot. Have a timetable for the day, and hold yourself to it, or ask someone to hold you to it. You should also write this timetable down. This gives your brain something to focus on throughout the day, gives you less opportunity to ruminate and writing down your intentions increases your chances of following through on them.

My number 1 piece of advice is to take up meditation. It really is an incredible tool. For five minutes every day, find a quiet spot and just make a conscious effort not to think about anything. Close your eyes and just focus on your breathing. You will experience obstructive thoughts, like ''this is boring'' or ''this is a waste of time'', but if you can push through them and get a good meditative routine, you can slowly increase the time you do it for and it is an extremely valuable tool. It will make you feel much, much better.

When you're feeling down you may not feel like you want to interact with people, but you really should. Interacting with people or animals releases the oxytocin chemical in your brain, which improves mood and builds social bonds.

A good rule of thumb which I learned from a psychiatrist I know is that when you are feeling depressed or anxious, the thing you least feel like doing (eg. interacting with people, showering, exercising, etc.) is the thing you should do the most. You will almost always feel better if you do.

TL;DR: Meditate daily, get a routine in place and be sure to write it down every day, take up new hobbies such as reading or exercise, if you feel strongly against doing something due to depressive feelings (eg. talking to someone, showering, exercising), then you should definitely just do it, you will feel better afterward, and talk to your therapist about your depression.

Mental illness can be a very difficult thing to deal with, no one ever said it was easy, but if you can work through it, there really is light at the end of the tunnel. I really hope this very long post (sorry 'bout that) helped, best of luck.

Edit: Also, feel free to PM me. Like I mentioned earlier, I'm going into psychotherapy as a profession, so I'm happy to help anyone who wants to talk."
writing,ewg49mo,t3_co0nyh,1565373565.0,"I personally never liked character sheets, they're usually full of arbitrary details and can be extremely tedious. 

The most important aspects of a character are their goal, motivation, backstory, relationships, values, how they express the theme of your story and sometimes their morality. But the most important part of your characters is making the reader either empathise or sympathise with them. 

What usually makes a character interesting are their personal conflicts (which enraptures goal and motivation and thematic expression, sometimes backstory) and their relationships with other characters (which encompasses their relationships, naturally, thematic expression and sometimes backstory). 

When generating conflict between characters, you should look at their values. What do these people stand for? What matters to them? Do they value justice? Family? Money? Freedom? Power? Characters with different values will usually come into conflict, and if they also have the same goal, that is a great opportunity to show the reader who they really are. Making your characters struggle helps build empathy between them and the reader, shows the reader who they are and makes them very interesting.

If you're writing an adult/serious work, morality is an incredible tool. Characters with questionable morality, or conflict between characters with opposing morality (eg. a character who means good, but refuses to break the law and a character who will do good no matter what, even if that means going against the law), are extremely interesting and easy to relate to.

Re: empathy and sympathy for your characters. Empathy is always preferable, but sympathy is quite nice, if you can generate it. Your reader should empathise with your protagonists, and in some cases, even your opponents. The reader will not feel empathy or sympathy for every character. Sometimes, you will have characters that are not meant to be empathised/sympathised with (like a demon in a fantasy story or a robot in a sci fi one), and sometimes you will have villains in your story. Villains usually are good at making your morally questionable characters seem good, or making bad guys seem less bad. I would also usually have at least 1 villain and at least 1 hero in every story of mine, to portray a kind of moral groundwork, no one is worse than this story's villain and no one is better than it's hero. I usually like to have a lot of antiheroes, but that's just my style. 

Pretty long post, so if you've made it this far, bravo. Always love to see aspiring writers, especially ones with the courage to reach out for advice, so if you've any more questions, feel free to PM me. Good luck with all your future stories ;)"
