pics,fqs5ob4,t1_fqr4lg0,1589599086.0,Omg. Paying that bill after everything just made me scream internally.
HealthAnxiety,fqq5l0s,t1_fqo2g9c,1589559781.0,"Thanks so much!! 

So- I’ve never officially been diagnosed with a GI issue before but after last night I think I need to try to get in with a gastro. I ended up calling my best friend who is an ER doc and explained everything to him. He had me take an EKG on my Apple Watch and said it looked picture perfect. He told me to drink a glass of milk and that helped very quickly- so he said that also ruled out cardio. He said to call my doc and get a prescription for a PPI and then try to get into gastro when I can. He said it seems likely to be GERD, I just never thought it would’ve been that. I had no real burning, just pressure and pain but sometimes that’s how it can feel apparently. I’m feeling like a new person today and so glad I didn’t waste a trip to the ER."
HealthAnxiety,fqnrfef,t1_fqnmbda,1589500009.0,Thank you so much
lexapro,fqn4i0p,t1_fqn4a31,1589488530.0,"I feel like maybe there are some improvements- possibly. I feel like I’m not crying as much, but my physical anxiety symptoms are wreaking havoc on me right now. I am currently trying to decide if I should go to the ER or not because I’ve had chest pain for days and I am so scared I’m dying. I’m completely spiraling and I can’t get out of it. I know my doctor said 6-8 weeks but I feel awful."
lexapro,fqn41gk,t3_gjswor,1589488305.0,"Interested in seeing what people have to say about this. I’m currently on 10 but I feel more anxious than I did. I’m only four weeks in, but I’m wondering if I need to up it or it it’s just flat out not for me."
HealthAnxiety,fqn0i4e,t1_fqn0c6p,1589486608.0,  I know but my brain keeps saying “but what if it’s not this time.” Im just laying in bed crying. I also started Lexapro four weeks ago so I also feel like it can’t be anxiety anymore. I’m so terrified right now.
HealthAnxiety,fqmznl9,t1_fqltuwa,1589486202.0,I’m right there with you. This chest pain is driving me insane. I want to go to the ER so bad right now but I’m so afraid of catching covid there. But I’m also terrified I could be saved if I go.
HealthAnxiety,fqmzk4k,t1_fqmtu7q,1589486155.0,Ugh. Right there with you. For pretty much two months I have felt like I’m drowning/chest pressure pain/throat tightness. I’m trying to talk myself out of going to the ER right now
HealthAnxiety,fqmsu3j,t3_gjbsap,1589482947.0,I do the exact same thing when I wake up. Lately I’ll feel fine until I think about it and then it’s all day long again. I’m so miserable.
HealthAnxiety,fqmspmo,t3_gj9560,1589482889.0,Oh man I’m so sorry. I’ve been having almost the exact same feeling. Waiting it the absolute worst part.
HealthAnxiety,fqmsb3t,t3_gjgnf2,1589482696.0,Bright red is usually a good sign and means it’s more surface level than something really wrong. It could be just a fissure or a hemorrhoid. Both very easily treatable.
HealthAnxiety,fqmhd6h,t1_fqjus0e,1589477469.0,My cardiologist can’t get me in until June 9th. Hopefully I don’t die before then 😭
HealthAnxiety,fqlukc1,t3_gjgyht,1589466342.0,Heart attack. All day every day. I should totally be dead by now.
lexapro,fqla05w,t1_fql91hg,1589451506.0,Thanks! I will look into them. Did you deal with chest pain/tightness physical anxiety? If so- did those help specifically with that?
lexapro,fql3ydx,t1_fqkr72w,1589445402.0,Thanks. I know it can take some time to find the right medication but I’m just feeling so discouraged. It took so much for me to start taking it and I just want to feel better :(
lexapro,fqkdkq1,t1_fqkdh01,1589425079.0,Interesting! I’ll definitely look into that. I’ve already been thinking about magnesium so I’m going to check into the others.
lexapro,fqkcbhz,t1_fqkc5a7,1589424359.0,"I so hope you hit that sweet spot soon!!! I’m sorry you’re struggling, but it’s comforting to know that it doesn’t work quickly for everyone. I feel so frustrated when I’m still feeling anxious because I’m like, wtf I’m on anti anxiety meds I shouldn’t be feeling like this. It also doesn’t help that time is CRAWLING right now with everything going on so it feels like it’s been soooo much longer than it actually has."
HealthAnxiety,fqjtihq,t1_fqjoefw,1589414975.0,"When I was very first diagnosed with anxiety years ago I went to the ER and they said I had acid reflux, but it’s never really been an issue since. The weird thing is, I don’t have any burning, just pressure/tightness/pain."
HealthAnxiety,fqjo24d,t1_fqjnvgf,1589412707.0,"I know. I just wish I could get it to stop. It does usually go away when I’m fully distracted with something else, but it only takes a second for the complete panic to come back."
HealthAnxiety,fqjnbz4,t1_fqjn8cz,1589412409.0,"In January I had an EKG, chest X-ray, echocardiogram. All were normal. I rationally can’t imagine I’d all of a sudden be dying a few months later, but my brain is telling me otherwise and I’m miserable."
HealthAnxiety,fqjmsga,t1_fqjmn91,1589412182.0,I’m anxiously awaiting an answer because I’ve been taking EKGs on my Apple Watch for days lol.  It keeps saying I’m fine but I don’t feel fine 😅 Hoping there would be some kind of market that I’m definitely NOT fine haha
HealthAnxiety,fqj8hyt,t1_fqhxm1s,1589406488.0,"This is almost exactly like mine. It’s awful.

Edited to add- it usually starts with diarrhea as soon as my heart starts racing."
HealthAnxiety,fqj8cm8,t3_gj1li7,1589406429.0,I feel mine almost always. I am so health anxious about my heart so I’m hyper aware of them.
HealthAnxiety,fqj88g6,t3_gj4bx1,1589406383.0,I’ve had this before after a panic attack.
HealthAnxiety,fqj81uu,t1_fqisiwa,1589406311.0,"“You know your body and pay close attention to it. Your brain may get signals mixed up and panic but trust your body to let you know what it needs and IF something is wrong.”

Every time I hear this I feel even crazier. I always feel like my body is telling me I’m dying (soon) and it truly feels so real. Then I’ll go to the ER And they’ll be like “oh nope you’re fine.” -_- it’s so freaking frustrating. I get what you’re saying, I just always worry that if I really was dying, would I even know? Lol

For example-since this whole thing started I’ve had miserable chest feelings. It varies daily, but some form of tightness, drowning feeling, heaviness, chest pain, etc. It’s been almost non stop. For two months. I have started working out and I feel fine when I do, so logically I tell myself that if my heart was giving out I wouldn’t be able to work out or run up the stairs or I’d be dizzy or SOMETHING. If this mess wasn’t going on, I’d definitely have gone to the ER by now. I still did message my cardiologist today to let her know how I was feeling because I feel like I won’t be able to relax until I know my heart really is ok :("
HealthAnxiety,fqj6q7b,t3_giv8eg,1589405796.0,Yes terribly. I’m so focused on my heart that I feel like I’m losing my mind. I started Lexapro four weeks ago and I’m praying it helps. I feel like I’m so afraid that I’m just going to drop dead any second. If covid wasn’t going on I totally would’ve gone to the ER by now. Logically I try to tell myself that if it was my heart- I’d probably be dead from not going to the ER by now so it’s probably just anxiety.
lexapro,fqh31eb,t1_fq7tx0f,1589366099.0,This is somewhat comforting. I just hit four weeks but I’m still having occasionally days of bad anxiety and am so scared it isn’t working. I started one week at 5mg and then three weeks ago moved up to 10. When I feel anxious I feel so discouraged and frustrated because I’ve been taking it for a month now. Glad to see that it can take a while longer to really kick in. Most people seem like it works much quicker.
lexapro,fqh2s1u,t3_gi4008,1589365846.0,"M y doctor prescribed me both together. I honestly loved how the hydroxyzine made me fall asleep, but I was waking up with awful heart fluttering every morning after I would take it the night before. I stopped taking it and now I don’t have the heart flutters, but I barely sleep :("
HealthAnxiety,fqh25cy,t3_gieo8i,1589365224.0,"Totally relate to this. I have felt like this for the past couple years. It’s miserable. The most frustrating part is that I’ll finally convince myself it’s anxiety and then I’ll read something stupid about “listening to your body” or “trusting your gut” and it all starts back over again. 

I am currently in week four of taking Lexapro and I will say, it has definitely helped. I’m very glad I decided to give it a try."
HealthAnxiety,fq5mdif,t3_ggh96l,1589110791.0,Thank you so much for taking the time to write this. It truly does help.
HealthAnxiety,fq5m5uc,t3_ggzsqv,1589110577.0,"I wish I just knew how to make it stop. I’ve had awful chest heaviness and crap for weeks now. I know nothing is wrong with my heart because I had a full cardio workup earlier this year, but I am obsessing over every single thing I feel or anytime I get out of breath which just makes it so much worse. I’m obsessively taking EKGs on my Apple Watch and checking my pulse and O2 levels with my pulse ox. It’s exhausting. You are not the only one who does this."
HealthAnxiety,fq14glw,t3_gghyac,1589041606.0,"I haven’t found the answer to this yet, but I’m right there with you. I’m a 29yo pretty healthy female and since the dreaded c word has been around I’ve been a mess. People will tell me how small my chances are of dying from it, but the small number is the ONLY number my brain cares about."
HealthAnxiety,fpxv4y0,t1_fpxhj0a,1588990205.0,I’m going to look into it. I wonder if the Lexapro would interact with it at all. I’m not a medicine person at all and I’m so paranoid about taking things.
HealthAnxiety,fpvt3ne,t1_fpvt0b0,1588951341.0,I actually just ended a couple days ago. :( I feel like I’m always whacked out around it.
HealthAnxiety,fpv15ps,t3_gflsvr,1588931112.0,I feel like I’ve been experiencing this almost non stop the past couple months. It sometimes feels like someone physically has their hand grasping around my throat. It is driving me insane.
HealthAnxiety,fpinzjx,t3_gdfr7j,1588644911.0,I’d love to be added to whatever you decide to do!
Anxiety,fotaqba,t3_g8nd9j,1588048708.0,"Oh my god. I get this too. It’s like my brain will play out an entire scenario that isn’t even real. This morning I was full blown sobbing because in a matter of minutes, in my head my husband had died and I had planned his funeral and I was going over my speech in my head. He was perfectly safe, but it was gut wrenching and had me so upset. I don’t know how to stop my brain when it starts getting out of control like that."
Anxiety,fot9crl,t3_g8xp8z,1588047714.0,Yup. It’s been happening much more frequently since all this crap started.
Anxiety,fot91tw,t3_g92uxz,1588047494.0,"I made a post almost identical to this this morning lol. We are not alone. It’s miserable, but someone on my post mentioned that your cortisol levels aren’t highest in the morning and peak around 9am. I thought that was interesting and definitely helped explained why I’ve been feeling so miserable."
Anxiety,fot8nrz,t3_g96uom,1588047218.0,"Yes- I’m dealing with it too and it seems like no matter how much breathing and stuff I do, it doesn’t get better. Mine almost feels like my heart is locked in a box that’s too small or something and it’s beating against the edges. It’s a miserable feeling. The past few mornings as soon as I wake up it actually feels like it’s almost vibrating in my chest, but my pulse isn’t even that fast -_-"
Anxiety,fot82u6,t3_g9aei1,1588046813.0,"Yes. I’m always worried that it’s not actually anxiety because it lasts SO long. Basically since mid March I’ve had almost non stop chest pain/tightness/shortness of breath. I had a full cardio workup in Jan/feb so I know my heart is healthy and fine, but these symptoms are driving me absolutely insane. I’m going into my third week of Lexapro and really hoping it knocks this shit out soon because I’m so tired of feeling like this."
HealthAnxiety,forq5pd,t3_g9255d,1588016548.0,"This happens to me so often. I’ll be CONVINCED I’m on my death bed and then poof, it’s gone. Sometimes it’s weeks of torment and anguish and then it just disappears. It’s such complete bullshit lol. I’m glad you’ve gotten some relief :)"
HealthAnxiety,fophqlz,t1_fophmws,1587961804.0,The dumbest party? I had a complete cardio workup in Jan/feb that showed everything was completely normal and I’m STILL freaking out. I hate my brain.
HealthAnxiety,foph27q,t3_g8q767,1587961299.0,"Always. It’s exhausting. If it’s too fast I freak out. If it’s too slow I freak out. If I feel like my heart is racing but my pulse is actually totally normal I freak out. Basically, I’m always freaking out 😂"
HealthAnxiety,fopgxmw,t1_foonfr4,1587961206.0,Ugh I’m so sorry. My oldest almost died as a newborn and I almost had a stroke during labor. It was so traumatic. That’s when all of my mental health issues really started. I had horrible post partum depression and it’s just manifested into other things since then.
Anxiety,fopgove,t1_foolsxa,1587961027.0,I started Lexapro a little over two weeks ago. I upped the dose last week and I think I’m still adjusting which is making it so bad maybe. This morning I tried taking a hydroxyzine to knock my out but it didn’t help too much.
Anxiety,font0kd,t1_fonsvds,1587925884.0,Wow. This is so interesting. I’ve been waking up right about 5-6am feeling miserable. Sorry you’re dealing with crap too. Hoping you can get peace soon ❤️
Anxiety,fomw785,t1_fomw2qu,1587905747.0,"Interesting. This is exactly how I’m feeling. I tried taking a hydroxyzine about three hours ago and got maybe another half hour of sleep. The rest of the time I’ve just been dozing in and out because as soon as I start to drift off, I get the heart fluttering strongly again. I’ll look more into this. Thank you."
Anxiety,fomvys9,t1_fomvm6p,1587905544.0,"That looks like it’s from stopping medication though and I’ve increased mine. I know that this can happen and I just need to stick it out so my body can adjust, but this is absolutely miserable. :("
AskReddit,fompuse,t3_g892en,1587899473.0,When asking your teacher/professor if there is anything you can do for extra credit.
HealthAnxiety,fomppoh,t3_g8b5ei,1587899311.0,"Yes!!! The week before I start my anxiety is almost unbearable. It gets a little better right after my period ends, but those two-ish weeks are brutal."
HealthAnxiety,fomon6w,t3_g88v6j,1587898113.0,"I get what you’re saying. For me, I never dealt with anxiety until I had kids. They are young, so the constant fear of not being here for most of their life and then having to grow up without me is debilitating at times. My husband is absolutely incredible and the best father to our kids that I could ever imagine, but I want to be here for their lives and watch them grow up. I’m hoping that maybe once they’re adults I’ll finally have some peace and no more anxiety 😅"
Anxiety,fomohom,t1_fomod1w,1587897939.0,It’s so annoying. I have awful health anxiety so then of course all the intrusive thoughts start that I’m dying and then I have to fight with myself that it’s just anxiety. Then my asshole brain is like “but what if it’s not” I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. It totally sucks.
Anxiety,fomoem3,t1_fomoaii,1587897839.0,"Yes! It sometimes helps me to think of other scenarios that have happened that I thought were definitely end of the world ish and well, we are still here. Hoping you can get some peace soon ❤️"
Anxiety,fomociv,t3_g8blyy,1587897774.0,"I’ve been having the same thing. It’s miserable. Do you have an Apple Watch? One of the few things that helps me is taking an ekg on my watch and seeing that my heart is actually beating perfectly normal, even if it doesn’t feel like it. I feel like my heart is flip flopping around inside my chest so often, but then my pulse and heart rather are totally fine. Anxiety is so stupid. 

Other than that, sometimes I put my legs up the wall and just breathe deeply and listen to a meditation track. That will sometimes help take my mind off my heart beating as well as slow my heart down."
Anxiety,fomo3wg,t3_g8by7q,1587897504.0,"I’m right there with you. As if my anxiety level wasn’t already heightened enough with everything going on, then this happens. I get it. It’s scary. But more than likely we will be ok :)"
Anxiety,fomnryr,t3_g8bp53,1587897127.0,Same. Like- I won’t feel anxious at all but then the physical anxiety symptoms start and I’m a mess for a while.
lexapro,fojkjiq,t1_fojd640,1587823309.0,"Thank you! I’m trying to get into an exercise routine. My job was pretty much on my feet the whole day when I was working but I haven’t worked in like six? Weeks now. I’m also not used to having all of this free time to just sit here and worry about everything. I will say that even though I’m having daily panic attacks, they don’t seem to be lasting as long so that’s great."
Anxiety,fojkdqy,t1_foj7uvv,1587823198.0,"So I just ended my second week. First week was great. I started out with 5mg and then I started getting a little more anxious again so I upped it to 10mg. Right now I think I’m still adjusting because my anxiety is pretty bad, but apparently if you stick it out and give your body the full 6ish weeks to adjust it’s life changing. I read so many posts on r/lexapro before deciding to finally do it. I’m just hoping this works for me. I do feel like my anxiety attacks aren’t lasting as long so far."
Anxiety,fojk4la,t1_foj78ck,1587823017.0,Yes it is. You can search all kind of different sounds and meditations. They have them for pretty much anything. I really really like the sleep meditations at night. Just hearing someone physically speak and tell me what to do really helps calm my brain down. I almost always fall asleep before it’s even over.
Anxiety,foj6zl4,t1_foj6t32,1587810869.0,I get what you’re saying. I was the same way. These are totally voice guided and are almost like sleep stories. I can’t just meditate on my own because the silence actually makes me worry even more. I’m sorry. I hope you can find some relief soon!
Anxiety,foj5rct,t3_g7nta9,1587809479.0,I get what you mean. I also find myself having overwhelming sadness knowing that other people do also have to experience this feeling.
Anxiety,foj5h4s,t1_foj59to,1587809151.0,I’m so sorry :( Do you have a school counselor or someone you could talk to to at least feel some kind of support?
Anxiety,foj5fqh,t1_foj54b7,1587809107.0,Ugh. That’s so rough. I haven’t worked in six weeks and it’s affecting me horribly. I’m also a very social person and pretty close with family members so to not be able to spend time with anyone is really messing with me. I feel like all I do is sit here and worry about everything.
Anxiety,foj529w,t1_foj4y5k,1587808680.0,"I’m so sorry you’ve had that experience. My mom always thought I was just “dramatic” and would get so frustrated with me when I would have anxiety growing up. As an adult, I’ve learned that it’s totally ok to feel what I’m feeling and it’s an actual illness. Therapy is rough. It can take a long time to find the right person. I’m not sure how old you are, but have you thought about medication? I started Lexapro a couple weeks ago and I’m hoping it’s the answer for me."
Anxiety,foj4spd,t1_foj4p93,1587808379.0,"The worst feeling is when you actually do feel like you’re dying and someone tells you to just calm down. Yeah no shit. I would if I could. That was really what I needed right now. 

I’m sorry. I get it. Are you being treated for anxiety at all?"
Anxiety,foj4jkg,t3_g7px5q,1587808086.0,"First off, you are NOT a burden. If you ever need someone to talk to who truly gets it, feel free to message me. Seriously- no judgement. I was/am the same way. It’s so frustrating that anxiety can cause such real and physical symptoms. I always feel guilty for how I feel because it’s not “real” even though it completely is. My mom struggles to understand my anxiety also and I’ve had to set a personal boundary that I just don’t mention anything about it to her because it just further upsets me. It sucks, but I have been able to find other support sources in my life and that helps."
Anxiety,foj48o0,t3_g7quer,1587807743.0,Have you tried meditation? There’s an app I really like called insight timer and it has some really good sleep medication tracks that help me to just turn my brain off and drift to sleep.
Anxiety,foj451j,t3_g7qmh5,1587807628.0,"I’m so sorry. I have been there before and I actually made a call to the suicide hotline. They saved my life. The number is 1-800-273-8255 if you need it. 

You DO matter. I know things feel hopeless right now, but I promise everything eventually gets better."
Anxiety,foj2xww,t3_g7q2sr,1587806266.0,I get a horrible fear that I’m going to die in my sleep and then have so much trouble because I’m scared. There’s an app called insight timer that has some really nice mediations for going to sleep and it does help me eventually calm down and drift off.
lexapro,foj2ruk,t1_foj2qru,1587806071.0,So happy for you! Hoping I get there soon because this is freaking miserable.
lexapro,foj2ego,t1_foj2de2,1587805652.0,Did you notice it get worse at first when bumping up?
Anxiety,foj26ge,t1_foir4i1,1587805402.0,"Yes! I also think not working has really messed with my brain. Before I could immerse myself in work and it really helped me to keep out those intrusive thoughts. Now that I’m home with pretty much nothing to do, I have all the time in the world to over think every single thing I’m feeling and convince myself I’m dying. It’s awful."
Anxiety,foj1w8h,t3_g7ne1y,1587805089.0,"I’m right there with you (29 F). I started Lexapro two weeks ago because I honestly can’t keep feeling like this every day. I also deal with severe health anxiety (the people over on r/healthanxiety are also a wonderful support group) I feel like I’ll go back and forth between feeling super hopeful for the future and then moments of just absolutely feeling like the world is ending and life will never be the same. I got a call from work about going back May 2. I haven’t been anywhere other than picking up groceries curbside since March 13th. I honestly don’t know how I’m going to go back out into the world after all of this. I’m terrified. You are not alone if that’s any comfort at all. ❤️

Edit to add: I also have the fear of sleeping. I have to calm myself down before bed every night because I’m convinced I won’t wake up. Sometimes I get myself so worked up that I just lay in bed awake for hours. That said, there’s an app called insight timer and it has really nice sleepy music that helps me. It also has some meditation tracks that really do help me to just relax and fall asleep. Good luck!"
HealthAnxiety,fohshzc,t1_fohsdca,1587771787.0,Exactly. I don’t WANT to be this way. I wish so badly I could not worry that I’m having a stroke any time my pinky goes numb or a heart attack anytime my heart starts racing or a brain tumor anytime I get a headache. That would be lovely.
HealthAnxiety,fohrfbw,t3_g7iir1,1587771201.0,"Following. My mom has said to me multiple times that “you won’t be happy until you end up with cancer.” Which is quite honestly something that would make me the most miserable. I am the way I am because I’m SO terrified of ending up with cancer or heart disease or something like that. She gets so annoyed any time I go to the doctor, even if I actually do have something wrong. It’s exhausting and I’ve actually just stopped telling her when I have anything going on."
Anxiety,fohgaej,t3_g7f1oo,1587765481.0,"Yes. And then I usually get anxious because I don’t have anxiety. I start worrying what awful thing is going to happen to me because I can’t possibly just be happy, right?"
AskReddit,foh4sod,t1_fof8jik,1587760541.0,"So, my first ever was also very religious (I was too then) and we had been dating a year. We both knew sex before marriage was “wrong” so we came up with a plan. We decided that basically if we could legally be married (I was 16? And he was 18 I think) then we would be. So we went to the park and had a “wedding” where we committed ourselves to each other before God. We wrote vows and everything. It was all ok because we found a loophole in the rules 😂"
WaltDisneyWorld,foh2p9o,t3_g78hrq,1587759847.0,"Favorite: Toy story land. I love everything about it. Growing up toy story was my favorite movie and I just love how they brought it to life. 

Least favorite: It’s so freaking hot. I just feel like there is no relief or shade really anywhere in the park."
HealthAnxiety,foh1qcw,t3_g7c6jt,1587759527.0,"So first, take a few breathe and trust me that this is going to be ok. I went through basically this exact same thing last year (minus the being pregnant part) and everything came back completely normal. This is apparently SUPER common. I was a disaster though when I got the call as well so I completely understand. I was convinced I had cervical cancer and I could not calm down. My gyno did tell me though that it typically takes a very very long time for those precancerous cells (if they are even that) to turn into full blown cancer. Mine ended up being no evidence of any kind of cancer at all and that’s usually how these go. They are doing everything they can to make sure you are safe and everything will be ok ❤️"

HealthAnxiety,fognspb,t1_fogmma2,1587754903.0,Yes! I don’t know how to convince myself that it’s just anxiety. I have these stupid little like people talks with myself going over that my doctor and cardiologist already checked everything so I’m fine and then my brain is just like “yeah but maybe THIS TIME it’s really not anxiety.”
HealthAnxiety,fognmtl,t1_foglf8m,1587754849.0,Ugh. I used to have this ALL the time. My doctor eventually put me on a beta blocker for anxiety  and it helped me so much. I’ve since weaned off of it but it was a lifesaver when I was having those episodes. I’d be anxious so my heart would start racing which would just make me even more anxious. It was an awful cycle that I couldn’t get out of.
Anxiety,fof4ppp,t3_g6crks,1587725946.0,Yes almost non stop since March. Sometimes it also feels like someone physically has their hand gripped around my throat and/or chest. It’s miserable.
HealthAnxiety,fof40u5,t1_foewvm9,1587725236.0,Yes! This is what my what I did and it seems to help. It’s crazy how many physical symptoms can be related to anxiety.
pics,focz4i4,t1_foaec2n,1587677798.0,Holy shit. That made me nauseous.
HealthAnxiety,fo2wuk7,t1_fo2wlc2,1587475973.0,"Well then that probably means they don’t see anything concerning. Trust me, if they thought there could be something they’d run another test to make sure. I’m so sorry. I hope you can find comfort and peace soon. ❤️"
HealthAnxiety,fo2qhrr,t3_g59w1e,1587471433.0,"I know what you’re describing and it’s miserable. The only thing that semi helped for me was getting a full cardio workup done earlier this year. Of course there are still moments where I question that they possibly missed something, but my medication is finally starting to help with the intrusive thoughts and I can talk myself down."
HealthAnxiety,fny04a0,t1_fnxlols,1587350222.0,Same. I’m convinced I’m in heart failure and I feel like I’m losing my mind :(
HealthAnxiety,fnxz8g1,t3_g4be3t,1587349628.0,Yup! All the freaking time. The most frustrating thing is that then I can’t remember if I had the symptom first or if I was anxious first and then the symptoms started. I also regularly say that if I was actually dying I’d have no idea because I would just think it was anxiety. I’ve been to the hospital multiple times convinced I was having a heart attack only for everything to be totally fine. Whenever I start to have the heart attack symptoms I try to tell myself that I know it’s just anxiety but my asshole of a brain is always like “but what if it’s NOT just anxiety this time.”
GERD,fnufu5s,t1_fnu4l3q,1587261114.0,I don’t drink caffeine or alcohol. I have been hitting the sweets and carbs HARD during this quarantine so I’m wondering if that’s messed it up. I’ll try cutting those and see if it helps. It just feels like no matter what I do it won’t go away and it’s driving me insane.
Anxiety,fnufq83,t1_fntyhfe,1587261042.0,"Not this specifically because my doctor isn’t really doing appointments right now. I saw a cardiologist in January/February and had two EKGs, bloodwork, and an echo which all came back normal so I feel like more than likely it’s not actually heart related. But as soon as this is over I hope I can get an appointment because this is miserable."
Anxiety,fnsuu2z,t1_fnsuox8,1587229221.0,"? I mean... I haven’t actually drowned but I do feel like I’m filled up with water inside my body all the way to my throat. I don’t know how else I would describe it.

People use “drowning” as a term when they feel overwhelmed, but I truly do feel a physical sensation of drowning. So..."
GERD,fns6daz,t1_fns683l,1587214009.0,Ugh I’m sorry. That sounds miserable. I feel like the only time I get any relief is actually when I do eat and then it comes back shortly after. I have very little appetite though (which could be a side effect of the Lexapro) so I’m hardly eating at all. That also makes me feel like I shouldn’t be having GERD issues since I’m not eating much of anything and then sends me freaking out that it’s my heart again :(
GERD,fns4ds0,t3_g3gk8y,1587212276.0,"I don’t have diagnosed GERD since I can’t get into my doctors right now with everything going on, but I’ve had this feeling almost non stop for the past six-ish weeks and I’m losing my mind. I googled it and it said I was in heart failure but I just had a full cardio workup in Jan/feb so I know realistically it probably isn’t that. I have severe anxiety and I think it has now led to this. I am so miserable and scared."
GERD,fns48f3,t1_fnrwjbb,1587212141.0,"This is what I’ve been having off and on (mostly on) pretty much non stop for the past six weeks. I of course did a google search and google had me convinced it was heart failure- but I just had a full cardio workup a couple months ago and everything came back normal. I’m miserable. Of course with everything going on right now I can’t get into my doctor for a visit, but I feel like this has to be GERD. Sometimes it feels like my heart is being squeezed or someone physically has their hand around my throat. It’s driving me insane."
KidsAreFuckingStupid,fnh9tre,t3_g1jsq8,1586958189.0,When I heard the word rape for the first time it was on the news when I was supposed to be in bed but my parents didn’t realize I had snuck back downstairs and was standing behind them like an absolute creep. I asked my mom because I thought for sure they said “rake” and she got kind of quiet. I then said “does that mean they killed someone with a rake?!?” She just told me yes and I always thought that was what it meant until I was a teenager.
lexapro,fn3e0as,t3_fz5jpm,1586618790.0,I started yesterday and woke up during the night like this. I think it may just be heightened anxiety which seems to be somewhat normal at first.
lexapro,fn37try,t1_fn342yo,1586614932.0,Ugh sorry. It sucks. My doctor also prescribed hydroxyzine also and I might try taking one of those tonight at bedtime.
