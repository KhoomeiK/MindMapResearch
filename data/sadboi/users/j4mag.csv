Grani and Vigna are very similar units in power level, though I'd argue Vigna is stronger because her dps is higher, and single-blockers really require high dps. Grani's block serves a similar role of covering her back when things get tight, but killing the enemies outright tends to be better. Plus vigna makes a passable assassin in a pinch.

In general both units fall off later on though. Neither really generate enough dp to accelerate you through a level, and in CC, you can't rely on your vanguard to hold out. Units like Seige and Bagpipe actually can hold their own as a substitute guard, but Myrtle is so strong because she enables your stronger units rather than substituting for them.

unpopularopinion,fmll7z2,t1_fmlj7es,1586188585.0,"The holdout is a consequence of package sizing, as I've said a couple times now. A 'stick' of butter is, indeed, not a unit, but it is a standard. Transitioning between units / standards is slow and surprisingly costly, which means different consumer markets are stuck in certain units. If, overnight, all units for everything switched to metric, I'd be as happy as you- probably happier even (again, imperial units suck for engineering).

That's not possible though. OP said 'all recipes should use metric', and I disagree: this would create a tremendous amount of food waste between the US, Canada, and Australia.

I've cooked using metric recipes, and I agree that converting units is frustrating. I feel you. But the change can't come from the recipe side. Saying that the only reason recipes haven't changed over is Americans being stubborn is insulting, because that's not why American chefs make recipes in imperial, and it reduces a genuine question of transitioning standards internationally into a game of 'us' and 'them', which is unproductive. 

Before you go 'don't get me started on Fahrenheit', understand that, again, centigrade/Kelvin are no more or less arbitrary than fahrenheit/rankine for daily use. For engineering/science, sure, they're somewhat obtuse. But just like you have to remember water freezes at 0 and boils at 100, I have to remember it freezes at 32 and boils at 212. The number of situations where one is appreciably more/less arbitrary than the other are incredibly few. Even chemistry relies on the even BP/FP of water being 100C/0C very infrequently. If you're working with ethanol or jet fuel, there's no practical advantage between the two, and I'd just rather use Kelvin or Rankine, where 0 is genuinely 0, and you can plot things on log scales without your unit system going undefined."

Oz in a quart?) but the fact is that everything I buy comes in imperial units. When a recipe says use 2 cups of heavy cream, im using an entire package. If I used 400mL instead, I'd be wasting nearly 80mL.

Just the same, i imagine recipes using imperial units cause food waste in the EU: a recipe that uses a quart leaves you 50mL short if you try to use a liter, and a recipe that calls for sticks of butter could leave you with a tub of butter with just a little bit left. Food waste is a real problem, but the answer isn't just making all recipes in metric because you have trouble memorizing imperial unit conversions.

https://youtu.be/TE8xg3d8dBg

I'll repost this here since it's been posted elsewhere in this thread. The only way to make easy-to-follow recipes that limit food waste in multiple disparate countries is sometimes to make the same recipe in both units, and that involves more than just multiplying by some factors. It involves knowledge of package sizes internationally, experimentation to know that rounding the ingredients won't ruin the ratios in the recipe, etc.

Saying 'your units are dumb and illogical' is cool and all, but recipes are based on packaging, just as packaging is based on recipes. We can't change one without changing the other, and the overhead involved is outrageous.

So keep being elitist. Your units are fine, and I hope you enjoy cooking with them. I'm fine with mine, and if you want to complain about them, that's good for you.

Recipes are *not* as exact as people think they are, even most baking recipes. They are tuned to the size of packaging to minimize waste(how many times have baking recipes asked for 2.5 egg whites?). 

Yes it is inconvenient to manually change a recipe's units over, but running everything in metric would require everyone in the US to convert units, which isn't really an improvement. Recipes should have both imperial and metric units, with the ratios coming out to nice round numbers you'd see on packaging, not just 8oz*29.57mL/oz=236.6mL.

Whereas a high fire rate causes defense to block more (DMG=ATK-DEF), because it reduces a fixed amount of damage per hit, carried over multiple hits, this is *not* true for RES. 

A RES of 30 means the target blocks 30% of incoming Arts damage. A RES of 65 means it blocks 65% of incoming arts damage. DEF cares about how that dps come in, but RES does not, it just blocks that percentage of your DPS.

Finally to address the 'not so above average burst' of angelina: Angelina at E1L40 with S2 equipped can solo kill big Bob in GT-6 with two triggers of her skill, in the time it takes for him to walk around the left side of the map.

She's situational at E1, but not because her S2 is bad. How many early maps involve bursting down bosses that can't be safely blocked? Angelina does get a significant power spike at E2, because her S3 is more widely applicable, but that's not too surprising. Most 6*s only come into their own at E2 (exceptions that come to mind are Eyja and Ifrit). Saria goes from buff Nearl to an unkillable SP battery, and SA goes from a side grade to Lappland to a one-man wave killer. She's situational, but I don't think that means she's a bad investment.

If it's with the boss, you can place your snipers to take out the reunion snipers that are around Big Bob, and place a melee DPS in front of him (Spectre would be a good choice if you can spare her). Bob won't attack until he starts walking so she should be able to do her work without getting attacked by anyone.

Question about packs: does the monthly card last for 30 days or a calendar month? As in, would buying now only get 3 days of benefits, or is it the same length regardless of when in the month you buy it?

AccidentalRacism,fe6gbbb,t1_fe69lt9,1578890029.0,"Sorry, I see what you're saying better now-- I read your comment more as a justification for the state of academic inequality than as an explanation of it. (i.e. ""Poor people shouldn't be taking the tests if they can't go to college anyways, that's why their scores are low. They shouldn't be taking them in the first place."")

It seems like that's a communication failure which is as much my fault as that of the wording. I think we agree on why the SAT score situation is problematic and why that problem exists, so I'm going to edit my original post to reflect that. 

Thanks for responding civilly, I made some assumptions about what you were saying instead of clarifying."
AccidentalRacism,fe65mv2,t1_fe611bu,1578882330.0,"~~Hi friend! I see you like reason and logic. Here is a collection of facts for you to ponder:~~

1. ~~Adversity (i.e. low average S.E.S.) sometimes means worse average outcomes (i.e. low average test scores).~~
2. ~~Sometimes people overcome adversity and still succeed in college~~
3. ~~People who show academic skills sometimes receive scholarships, even (especially!) if they can't afford to go to college~~
   1. ~~Bonus fact: sometimes it is beneficial to take chances that could improve one's future prospects, especially if the costs are insignificant in comparison~~

Edit: I agree with you! It's a shame that the number of people taking the tests is dropping, especially because they shouldn't have to miss out on opportunities to get college educations."
worldnews,fclh364,t1_fcjamq7,1577747637.0,"I just finished *The Fall* by Camus this summer, and it was a really interesting way to tie things together. There's this apparent contradiction between the message of *The Plague*, where it's implied that we're all obligated to do good, and *The Stranger*, where it's implied that we don't really have any obligations at all except to be free.

*The Fall* addresses this in part by [exploring](https://www.pdcnet.org/collection/show?id=ipq_2011_0051_0004_0467_0482&file_type=pdf) some of [his and Sartre's ideas on freedom](https://aeon.co/ideas/how-camus-and-sartre-split-up-over-the-question-of-how-to-be-free) and looking at how real freedom comes with some amount of guilt and regret. Clamence (the speaker) condemns everyone because nobody is absolutely good, but I think the implication is that the reader should forgive everyone because nobody is absolutely evil either. 

I'm not entirely sure I 'get' the book, but if you like *The Plague*, I can definitely see you appreciating *The Fall*. Honestly, I find Camus' whole philosophy really interesting, especially in context with his relationship with Sartre and the politics of the time (circa WWII)."

And the point of the question is that the computer is slow, not that it's running M.2 PCIe SSDs with optane to cache. Can a saturated network connection be bottlenecked by a HDD? Yes, potentially. Practically, it's probably not happening."
IsItBullshit,f6iogzc,t1_f6ilhe2,1572881854.0,"I agree that usually peoples ideas of 'network speed' tend to be more attributed to latency / packet loss etc. than with bandwidth.

That said, few to no discs saturate the Sata III standard. Generally, it's more representative to look at the disc sequential read/write speeds to get an 'optimistic' idea of bandwidth rather than looking at the cable."
IsItBullshit,f6il354,t3_drinxt,1572880301.0,"Define speed. Network transfer speeds are almost always an order of magnitude slower than internal speeds. For example, Gigabit network speeds are 128 MB/s, where a slow hard disc drive (its 2019 people should have SSDs) runs at 120MB/s sequential write. That means you *might* be bottlenecked by the disc on a fast network connection.

For other components, comparison is more difficult. Talking about bandwidth of CPUs is really apples-to-oranges. A slow PC might have trouble rendering 4K video even if it's being streamed in smoothly. In this case, the bottleneck might be the GPU/CPU. 

So yeah, not bullshit. Practically, only going to happen on *old* computers with gigabit+ network speeds.

Edit: to expand on this, using a solid state drive is a cheap upgrade compared to a hard disc drive that will make day-to-day use of a computer faster, even outside of internet use."
