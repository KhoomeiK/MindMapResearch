So my glasses got broken and I had to wait a long time for the repairing but when I was out I felt like I couldn't see anything and it made me feel it was not real and I started dissociating more frequently"
addiction,fm9jy69,t3_fttg8p,1585870271.0,"My dad was a drunk but I wasn't allowed to drink anything until I was 18. Anyway I did it sometimes and I didn't like it too much. But weed changed my point of view about drugs.

I couldn't comprehend the appealing of drugs until I understood I hadn't to feel bad ALL THE TIME. Also I used to think weed was super dangerous and when I discovered it was pretty inoffensive I wanted to try more drugs thinking what people had told me about drugs wasn't so true.

So I would say you should be honest about what drugs feels like and above all be a loving mother who your kid can trust about these kind of stuff and they don't need to hide it from you so if it happens you can help them properly."

AspiePartners,fi2b43d,t3_f622ck,1582075658.0,"I had the same problem with my girlfriend. I have BPD and I think I'm autistic, and she is also autistic. We have been a few times almost breaking our relationship.   


I can only tell you, you should pay attention on what she's saying. I don't know exactly what happened but I'm sure you can give her some reassuring words so she doesn't feel like she's worthless. You shoukd assure her you love her and stop making hurtful things.  


If you don't know when you're saying too much you should pay attention when she says your words hurt her. I hope you can fix your relationship and be a better partner"
autism,fhs64t5,t1_fhgwr62,1581855120.0,I'm just sharing my experience. I'm not the first person I know who discovers she's autistic by a trip. I was curious about others experiencies like mine.  My english is not the best so I couldn't express all I wanted  but I mean no harm and I thought this maybe would be more common.

It wasn't my first trip and it wasn't my first bad experience, but this wasn't like other bad experiences. I'm talking about pretty intense sensory overload in my post, and since my trip lasted 6h more at least I had a profound talk with my flatmate and she helped me with those sensations and thoughts and this was my conclusion."
