So if I understand correctly you both have to have the money to purchase the contract at it‚Äôs current rate and then basically have margin to pay the other side of the trade should it float that direction. 

Do you have to designate a specific amount of money as margin in the trade or is it just the value of your account and you just have to set some kind of stop order or limit order to prevent losing everything should the trade go strongly against you?  

The other day a week or two out I was thinking of selling a few contracts at 262 range and it hasn‚Äôt even come close to coming back to that range.
