Anger,fkjei14,t3_firofv,1584243599.0,"This is something I am dealing with as well.
It is the main reason why I have started therapy really.

One thing I have started doing is tracking my moods, and if they are on the negative side I do a little write up as to what happened and what set me off. It has made me more mindful not what is going on, my reactions, and if I lash out at him or anyone. It has helped me since I have to force myself to remember what is going on in the moment so that I can write it down after my episode which makes me more aware of what I am doing. It is a difficult thing to do and I still have not mastered it but it's really helping."
bipolar,fisle4s,t1_firxhxl,1582687155.0,"I have been trying to fine the right term for something that I find I struggle with in one of my ""happier"" moods. I've been tracking my moods for about a month and a half for my psychiatrist and I never know what to put but as soon as I saw ""goal seeking"" it clicked. Thank you for posting. You have NO idea how much it will help me to better keep track on what is going on."

Exercise,fhcpnyw,t1_fhcp6eg,1581468091.0,Yeah... She was on vacation and in the process of moving offices after. Walk in clinics here are also not the best.  Thank you for your suggestion. I'll definitely get him to make a list to prepare.
Exercise,fhcocdn,t1_fhcmkcx,1581467245.0,"Right ...sorry haha. 
The pain is localized to his  right hip area.  They didn't do anything other than feel around where the pain is and gave him a prescription then sent him on his way. He does want to do the workouts but the pain is causing him to struggle even with those. laying down makes it feel better and sitting,standing, walking and any movements that he has to do for longer than 10 minutes causes him pain.  The Dr appointment coming up is with our family doctor to see if she can get some tests ordered."
