Though I would be less offended if they asked outright since at least they’d be acknowledging that it’s something they’re interested in.

Instead, “Where are you from?” feels more racist because it seems like they thought “I can’t ask their ethnicity because that might be racist, but let me ask anyway in a way I think is not racist.”

It’s kind of like

“Why didn’t you just ask my ethnicity?”

Basically, the way the existing “safety net” functions is that it disincentivizes some people from working. There are situations in which taking a part-time or low paying job will disqualify people on assistance from receiving any assistance at all and as a result, they would end up with less in their pockets every month than if they just didn’t work at all.

EDIT:

Adding since this comment is getting a moderate amount of attention.

If you are depressed seek help. It’s important to know that none of these activities make you a bad person. And if you slip you slip; it happens. Dont’t let shame keep you from trying again. 

Don’t think “Well, I fucked up again, I guess it doesn’t really matter. I guess I’m just fucked up. Who cares.”

I’ve been there. But believe me, you can be better. Some days you’ll feel like you’ve turned a corner and none of that shit will bother you ever again. Then the next day you’ll wish you were dead and fall back into it. That’s ok. 

Just try to work on yourself. Find an alternative activity. Attend a meeting. Try helping someone. Anything is something. Hopefully, over time, the number of “good days” before you have another “bad day” will get longer.

But you need to know:
You aren’t broken. You are human. Your faults are what make you beautiful and make you into a person that can help people. Here is a quote I ponder a lot:

>	The wound is the place where the light enters you.
