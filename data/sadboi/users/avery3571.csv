bipolar,ey32yls,t3_cv7uq3,1566754091.0,Once I was diagnosed and got some meds going and looked back realized all those times I thought I was right in an argument I was wrong usually. Just being manic. Now I can stop myself and admit I was wrong and stop it before it escalates to far like in the past. It's hard to keep in check not going to lie.

BipolarSOs,ey305ov,t1_ey1jpvm,1566752210.0,I agree with you. That's the most reasonable approach
BipolarSOs,ey2zqfq,t3_cv2l75,1566751927.0,Bp2 here. I found that on both sides of moods I was paranoid like this. After getting medication and couple counseling I was able to recognize that it was on me for assuming the worst of my spouse like our whole relationship. There was a shift there were I was unhappy with how I was acting instead of how I thought she was acting. This was after like 10 years together that I finally got diagnosed and actively tried to change. Unless he is willing to wake up he won't be woke. Reminders from my wife that I'm her guy helps. After I turned a corner I make sure to tell her every day. Sorry for the long winded reply just my experience as this post hit home.
