Not sure where you are, but in many regions there are fly fishing groups for combat veteran rehabilitation. Project Healing Waters is one with a few chapters across the US. Check with your local VA and you might find something."

DaveRamsey,fpifdv8,t3_gdme72,1588639774.0,"So I’m 25 and I’m doing pretty well - I’m not rich, by any measure, but I have a solid gig and I’m stable. I live in a rural area and make more than ~85% of my peers. 

My life is incredibly boring, and I watch people lead much cooler lives than me. I honestly have no idea how anyone is able to travel extensively, purchase homes, go to a million concerts, or buy nice cars. The only feasible answer is that they are probably driving themselves into debt. 

As Dave once said, people will never be rich because they’re trying to look rich."

flyfishing,fp89rtv,t1_fp89ccm,1588387042.0,"I catch a lot! I still have my skunks of course, but I typically do well. When it comes to trips to other places, I of course throw in whatever is appropriate for where I’m heading. But for my everyday fishing here locally, it’s all about knowing the water. I fish about 5 different creeks in my area and align my box accordingly - Where I live, an assortment of nymphs and buggers does the trick. I always keep a few dry flies on deck and a few “hail mary” flies to try when nothing else is working, but I keep it minimal. I also tie up some new things throughout the year to experiment - if it works, it works, if it doesn’t, I’ll nix it."

Documentaries,fijrvbn,t3_f82tsp,1582461755.0,"Lots of folks don’t realize this, but Appalachia begins in Southern NY State. When people hear NY, they or course think of one of the largest cities in the world, not the massive landmass it’s attached to that is largely comprised of rural towns, many akin to the south. Where I grew up in rural Western NY, there is extreme, almost third-world level, poverty. Although not having running water wasn’t too common, it certainly wasn’t unheard of. It’s really frustrating because no one really knows what most of Upstate NY is, how rural it is, and how much help it needs."

It’s even more interesting because foot fetishes are *extremely* common. I’m willing to bet more people have foot fetishes then eat ass, yet no one talks about it.

Yes, there are a lot of creeps out there wanting to buy your feet pics or whatever, but most of us just enjoy feet - preferably our partners."
