intj,fr47o4a,t1_fr47ec1,1589878732.0,"Definitely. And therefore, it makes me think further about how absurd it is that we can't grasp the very concept of the world. The absurdity lies in the relationship between people and the world. I feel that some people might stop thinking about the world and life itself, so existence is more manageable and understandable. If you focus on the day to day details life can get less vast. There's some beauty in the absurd and the lack of meaning, I think. Some mystery."
progresspics,fr44trn,t3_gmjzq7,1589875841.0,Congrats! I have your same stats exactly. I'm currently at 170 and going down. I'm more bottom heavy than you but your pictures give me a good idea of what it will be like.
intj,fr15rfm,t1_fr0qha1,1589813778.0,"I disagree. I think that the world is utterly irrational. The absurdity of life and meaning, as well as our finite understanding of an infinite world makes this world seem rather illogical. Lately I'm reading Albert Camus, who expands on the theory of the absurd and makes it a philosophical approach to understanding the meaning of life and existence (or maybe rather the lack of it). It helps me understand more about death and the anxiety that thinking about it brings."

It's being nice, I didn't know calories stretch so much. I've done diets all my life and I'm so tired. I have binge eating disorder but under control for a long time, and I'm going to therapy to learn how to eat again. I am slowly seeing how the lose of control in food is a manifestation of not having control in some aspects of my life, which I'm taking care of. This time I'm determined because I'm seeing the root of the problem (finally!) Good luck to you too, hope to see you around and reaching your goals."

mensa,fq77zwq,t1_fq5vl1f,1589142964.0,"Your reply deserves a response.

First af all, and I acknowledge that this terminology comes from the previous comment, but I don't see how using the word ""idiot"" is acceptable. 
Second, people with low IQs can, in fact, learn. They might struggle with commands that include a number of steps (such as the example provided in your reply), and therefore need to be instructed step by step. I know this because I am a teacher, and this year I have a student with a severe mental disability who is definitely learning using this method of easy, step by step instruction. Every year I have students such as the one I just mentioned; and I can say that, at least the ones I have encountered during my career, are in fact capable of learning more than basic tasks.
Third, you mention IQs for NASA engineers and janitors. Where do you get that from? 
Fourth, I highly doubt your ""purely scientific"" statements. I come to this conclusion by the language you use: ""idiot"", ""useless"", and by your casual comment on how your wife ""sneakily"" got her assistant to take an IQ test. It sounds as truly disgusting behavior and it does imply you think of these people as not worthy, since you don't condemn such action.

What I find heartbreaking is how someone who might have a high IQ can be so ""handicapped"" (using your own terms) when it comes to empathy. I can't sneakily make you take an empathy test, [so I can do it blatantly ](https://psychology-tools.com/test/empathy-quotient)

Cheers."
