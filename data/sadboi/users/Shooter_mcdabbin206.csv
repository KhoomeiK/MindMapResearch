deliverydrivers,fq373i5,t3_gg9z7x,1589063622.0,Dude I had this exact problem . When you are cashing out make sure to add them into the computer . They are only there automatically if the tip was prepaid . Always check your receipt and if there is a discrepancy Baal your gm or whoever is cashing you out . As someone else said sone franchises put your cc receipts on paycheck although speaking myself only experienced this at one franchise of round table pizza that I worked at.

Working for the airlines and pulling this can get you pulled off your schedule ie put on suspension or be sent to a training class . I’ve probably racked up 500k+ miles since I turned 18. Not saying I haven’t seen a rude flight attendant (usually in reaction to a rude customer )but have a hard time believing a flight attendant would risk themselves telling off someone who paid for the seats (and they can tell if the seats were hers easily  ).

There are check riders ie united employees (all airlines do this ) who pose as customers and watch Ual staff for quality control . Talking to a customer like that is risky as hell unless they are being violent or disruptive . Then the fact that she claims she’s in NC and is flying 5 hours to Cali . Ual doesn’t have a direct flight to California out of North Carolina . You have to transfer to one of their other hubs . Asked my gf who is a flight attendant for delta and she had a hard time believing it .
AmItheAsshole,fllujzn,t3_fpctvz,1585268030.0,"NTA. This story seems a bit fishy to me though . As someone who used to work in the airline industry(continental before they merged with ual )  and who has a mother AND a gf who are/were flight attendants  (mom was for 35 years gf has been for 10, delta and British airways ) I’m kind of finding  it a bit difficult to believe that a flight atttendant would not only tell you to give up seats that you paid for but also called you selfish . I asked my gf and she said only a flight attendant who wants to get written up would pull that (especially with the risk of a check rider , a ual employee posing as a customer who watches the flight attendants for quality control ). My second bit is you say your flying United and it’s a 5 hour flight . UAL doesn’t have any non stop flights to California from NC. You have to go via Newark, dulles, or O’Hare and I think Houston . 

Definitely NTA if this is all true , I feel like I need more info though ."
