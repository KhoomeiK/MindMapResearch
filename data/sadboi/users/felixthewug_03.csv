unpopularopinion,fogllrx,t1_fogik7b,1587754158.0,"I asked you how you can take science and say it's a religion. How are they the same?

Religion is blind faith that somebody chooses to follow. It is not substantiated by any sort of scientific data or evidence. It does not use the scientific method. It just *is*. Not that I find anything wrong with people who practice their religion, but the science is not there.

So you actually hear advice from health experts or even scientists and think to yourself, ""this is like a religion!"". I mean... you have to be cognizant of the fact that science doesn't pretend to always be 100% right, they just strive closer to the truth with the *evidence* they possess to substantiate it. Hypotheses are proven wrong all the time so they can get it right and we do come to a consensus all the time. Science is not a straight line.

 What I don't understand is, if you won't listen to the people most qualified to handle this issue, who on earth are you listening to? If people who are *literal experts* on infectious diseases doesn't cut it, what is your alternative? Many people have decided to delve into tin-foil hat conspiratorial nonsense and that is just *more* dangerous, wouldn't you agree? 

And with religion, it assumes everything and anything they believe (or cherry-pick)  is 100% correct with no question or evidence.

They are not the same. Science puts the effort in and we use it to best aid the people with what we already know and we use it to search for solutions."

The thing to keep in mind though is that if for whatever reason the joysticks on your lite start to drift, you're not able to take them off. I've had mine since November and have had no issues however. 
I just REALLY love pokemon and wanted the special edition. But that is a concern for switch lite owners. If i wanted to send it in to get repaired they will just give you a new switch lite.

The lite is also a bit smaller than a normal switch but I love how compact it feels. A nice case grip goes a long way. And if for whatever reason you want an OG switch as well, you can transfer save data between the two systems."
unpopularopinion,fmwft75,t3_fxtw0l,1586445810.0,"I don't mean this to be harsh in any way. Just my 2 cents. Take it as you will. 

Religion is simply following blind faith. You are taking a plunge and betting that it is the right one. Any religion really. Not that I find anything wrong with somebody practicing their faith or anything, I just really disagree with your sentiment.

Science progresses and advances through testing and research. Things are disproven and proven all the time through the scientific method. Real EFFORT, time and thought are put into these ideas.
The thing with science is it doesn't pretend to be 100% right, and in doing that, they just strive closer to the truth. It puts forth evidence to back up any claims they may have. Science is not meant to be a straight perfect line so I don't know why you expect it to be. 

And to characterize society as following it like a religion? More like adults who'd rather follow scientific advancement and progress because the scientists actually WORKED at trying to prove whatever they are trying to prove. Of course I'm going to take the word of experts. To compare religion and science in this way is just apples and oranges.. I'm sorry.."
