relationship_advice,errroco,t3_c3c2s3,1561180644.0,"Listen ...this woman has been told she is beautiful her whole life. The attention is all she knows. That will mold a person for life. The reason she has quit her job three times is probably because she was afraid of what she may do. Any woman of willing can find the courage to put her foot down and tell a man to fuck off. It isn’t always the easier thing to do as I do know I’ve been in the same situation ...often times she may laugh it off so as to not make any awkward moments occur because you want everything to be ok at work. It takes a long time for someone like that to build up the courage to tell people to simply fuck off, believe me. I quit my last job for what seems to be the same reason. I more or less told my boss to get lost multiple times then would still try to play it cool so as to not have my job messed with. Your wife may be at a point in her life where she still likes the attention or she very well might not know how to simply tell a man to get lost for fear of making someone upset. I am currently ok with telling a man to get lost. I do not care. It takes guts and courage though and a lot of rewiring of the brain after having pretty much every dude in your life hit on you. It becomes a part of your life. Hard to explain really. But hey I am a firm believer in second chances and everything but idk ...you may want to consider everything. I’m very sorry for what happened to you. I don’t understand how a woman who claims to love someone so much could ever take the chance of wrecking someone’s confidence like that. Keep your chin up. Remember she’s only human and yes what she did was wrong in every way doesn’t mean you have to forgive her but what’s done is done ...make your next decision carefully. Take some time for yourself first t might help clear your mind. Again I’m sorry for your situation and I hope this all plays out nicely for you both. And good for you for not being the one on the other side of the fence (not bashing her or anything ) but good for you."

Parenting,erol39l,t3_c2qdj1,1561081838.0,Aw girl don’t worry you definitely love your daughter just as much. If you didn’t then you wouldn’t be worried enough to ask for people’s help or write what you just did. Take it one day at a time. You’ll be okay :)
Parenting,eroj266,t1_ernqgfl,1561080324.0,Oh and to answer your question ...we both don’t get much sleep and it’s not great sleep either 😔 really trying to fix that
Parenting,eroj0en,t1_ernqgfl,1561080286.0,Ah such a great idea. I should look into that! Honestly the days are kind of tiring too with not much interaction just us two. See we are on a really strict budget planning and saving for future endeavors that will actually later benefit our little one. It really seems to be that everywhere we go I think about the gas money we are spending or the cost of the activity. I’d much rather put that towards a mommy’s helper during the day that wouldn’t be too bad. Also it’s hard for me to really allow myself to make good friends around here. I mean I do try my best to socialize and I have found plenty of great mommy friends but it’s just difficult with such different schedules and to top it off just the anxiety alone of getting to know new people. I don’t have that “normal” or whatever you want to call it ..life where my friends from school are around we all have kids etc etc and not much family. It can be so very depressing at times. But I stay strong her her. My mom didn’t try to socialize really with any other moms and I always kind of hated that I wish she would have just taken chances and got over herself. I understand her I do but I try to be stronger than that and actually go out there and be a part of the community even if it’s just for a day. Thank you so much for your words. And yes kindergarten is very close and I know the break will be nice sometimes I just think I should be trying to soak up every minute of this because she won’t be little forever and I don’t know if I am doing that to the best of my ability. Really trying to though.
Parenting,eroiks1,t1_ernp0u9,1561079962.0,You are amazing for just giving me these kind words. Thank you so much. I really appreciate the good words. Some days I feel like I am super mom and then  I just have these periods of time where I feel so worthless. Honestly thank you from the bottom of my heart it was so uplifting to read..made me tear up a bit :)
Parenting,eroigyl,t1_ernovs5,1561079883.0,Thank you honesty yes I’ve thought about these things I really do need to jump on that. She will be going into pre-K this fall... just finished her first year at preschool this past year...I’m going to jump on every opportunity that comes our way. Thank you for the reminder. I think I’ve been so burned out from it all lately (and the late work nights) that it just left my mind. Doesn’t help that me her and her dad don’t have much tome together all three of us. I have off two days during the week which is when he is tired so we kind of just snuggle up at home but I’m beginning to think that some serious changes need to be made with our schedule
Parenting,eroi9zb,t1_ernnztk,1561079736.0,Eh no we socialize her...play dates with other kids and moms from preschool and such. She gets a lot of interaction at the park too. She’s such a social butterfly but it’s hard to take her out of the situation I can give a heads up like “fifteen minutes before we go” so as to not start a tantrum but they still always happen which I know is normal but yeah lately I don’t know what it is. She just has been throwing them quite a bit. The one thing I am sad about though is not much family around here...no cousins to grow up with kind of thing and that’s is what makes me sad for her future. We’re trying to have another baby but hasn’t happened yet. 😢

RoastMe,erlz1i9,t3_c2h3sl,1561000852.0,I think you’re lovely. Don’t put this crap up on here. You’re handsome and I’m happy you are giving up the video games for a while ...embrace new things no matter how hard the change may be in the beginning. You’re beautiful inside and out don’t forget it. Much love to you my friend.
depression,erlvyn7,t1_erl1kej,1560998343.0,"Man I’m so sorry to hear that. 😢 no kid or adult should ever have to feel the pain of being abused in any way. Wish I could take away your pain. Just know you’re not alone. Honestly I think this is one of the great things about reddit too...it’s nice to come on here, hopefully not be judged, and just be able to talk about anything. How would you say your day to day life is? Idk what I’m asking really I guess just what does your life look like. Job? Friends? Still talk to family? How old are you? I guess I ask for myself really...I try to look at my life in segments ...grow from each segment of that time. Sometimes I think I got so far In life and then there will be times like what I’m going through right now where I feel completely lost. Idk I guess what I am saying is feel free to talk about yourself. I’d love to hear your story."
depression,er9dtpz,t3_bycijd,1560622133.0,"I know how you feel. My whole life I was told how beautiful my eyes were how pretty I was as a child and a teen. How smart I was. Etc etc ...some may think this is a great thing...it not led me to a very dark place. That song with many of life’s troubles .., I am now in a good spot in life and I should be happy but I can’t help but feel so alone all the tine. Doesn’t matter who is around me or what’s going on. I am so sad it feels like ...every second of the day. Everyone I work with thinks “wow she is so fun so exciting to be around ...what a positive girl...she is magnetic...” not trying to boast myself but I’m very aware of how I make people feel and how they feel just being around me...truth is i am so sad all the time. All the time. I have many reasons to live and I’ll always keep on pushing ..for my girl, my husband, for my dad and my brother and sister  and my mom. But I don’t think I will ever be happy in life. I just don’t know how to think anymore. 

Edit: the being told I was smart thing ...HAH...never felt so dumb in my life and the being told I am beautiful thing...wow ...I couldn’t care less anymore and I’ll never see what they have seen. But these aren’t even the things getting me down currently...it’s just ...life ...what the hell is it all."
