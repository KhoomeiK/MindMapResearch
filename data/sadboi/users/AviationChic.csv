aviationmemes,fqpmfwr,t1_fqm5lif,1589549742.0,It's an aircraft mechanic joke.
aviationmemes,fqpljf7,t1_fqm67i2,1589549179.0,"Aircraft Mechanics purchase tools, usually from companies like Snap-on where reps come to their shop..  With orders they will get a sticker for their toolbox.  I guess it's a joke only AMTs will get.  LOL"

techsupport,foad72n,t3_fil3x8,1587644747.0,I was googling this same question when your link popped up.  I watched the youtube video below and it is kinda lengthy and full of a little fluff but basically it copies the style of one box and you can apply that to another whether that be text or imaging or whatever.

aviationmaintenance,fjd6m6i,t3_fcum05,1583246859.0,where you at?
HorrorMovies,fjd3vbk,t3_fcncnw,1583245019.0,"That's so tough because I've seen so many it's hard to get creeped out anymore.  I think it's when you are like.. ""that could actually happen!""  LOL.  There is a scene in the ""The Caller"" (2011) that I still get the jumps over.  If you haven't seen it, I recommend the movie.  I won't give it away but it's a bathroom scene that got me.  Probably cuz I was watching it in bed and my bathroom door was in site.  LOL.  Good luck in your search and it would be great to update us on any you movies you find that scare you."

Scarymovies,ffepdse,t3_eszw7u,1579858763.0,So after doing a little research I believe this was first created as a 4 part mini series and then condensed into this movie version.  It makes sense after you see it because it does feel a bit abridged.  Anyways I thought it a cool find.
Scarymovies,ffepb0q,t1_ffdup0y,1579858640.0,There are two ‚Äúcrooked House‚Äù movies out there.  I am familiar with the Agatha Christie but this one is different.  Surprised me to find so I watched it.  And totally different.
Scarymovies,ffdcewh,t3_eszw7u,1579817912.0,It‚Äôs a tad bit indy ish...

suggestmeabook,ffcbw8r,t3_essy7r,1579796107.0,"Anything by Zora Neale Hurston.  My son took an African-American literature class and when he was done I took his book of her short stories.  particularly love ""Sweat""."
Scarymovies,ff3mzwx,t1_ff38n4m,1579544523.0,I actually saw the last exorcism part 2 but not the first.  ha!  I will check it out.
suggestmeabook,ff2zrgl,t3_er2yx9,1579529767.0,"Anything by James Lee Burke. Not that I would re-read the whole thing but some of his descriptions are poetic and cause me to stop, re-read and ponder on how I could obtain that kind of talent.  :-)"

  Movies similar... hmm..  for time period I would say ""woman in black"" with the harry potter kid.   for the story line... maybe Nicole Kidman's ""Beforfe I Wake."""
Anxiety,fe86ios,t3_enuvi1,1578923094.0,HECK YEAH!!!  That is so frickin awesome! Every day take one step forward.  And it looks like you took many steps forward yesterday.

Scarymovies,fdnkold,t3_em3dgi,1578587813.0,I liked the first one. not an award winner but none the less not so bad.  I won't go cra cra over this one but surely will watch it when it is available on a streaming service.
Anxiety,fdkdsyj,t3_elv0nz,1578501746.0,"My daughter went through the heaviness in her chest.  She ended up going to the ER because it went on for a week and her regular doctor wasn't available.  They worked her up and found out along with the anxiety she had bronchitis.  they gave her some ""as needed"" anxiety medication along with an inhaler, breathing treatment and antibiotics.  She followed up with her regular doctor and was able to talk about a long term solution. So I guess my advice would be to see your doctor soon.  In this day and age you should be able to get some relief and you never know there could be another issue going on.  I hope that helps.  Good Luck to you!  and congrats on the new baby!"
Scarymovies,fdk0fgb,t1_fdjn25t,1578492939.0,My favorite scene is when she screams at those men in the parking lot.
Scarymovies,fdk0ala,t1_fdi2cyu,1578492837.0,It really was.  Wish I could do that.  Especially when hosting the holidays.  lol.
Scarymovies,fdh7l9i,t3_ekwm2h,1578417108.0,watched this after seeing your post.  Pretty darn good.  Not a scary movie but def a good plot with a twist.  I especially loved when she screamed at that guy in the parking lot.
HorrorMovies,fddxfvq,t3_ekt94a,1578326329.0,"Good question! I think it's because there are the ""oh shiiiiiit""  or ""girl, don't go in the basement!"" moments...  get's you jumpy and energized.  lol."
aviationmaintenance,fbbgebe,t3_e9xxuf,1576699908.0,"If you are looking for any pitot/static test equipment such as adapters or hoses,  check out Cobra Systems out of Arlington Heights, IL.  I worked there for a short time and they do a great job.  Good people there."
