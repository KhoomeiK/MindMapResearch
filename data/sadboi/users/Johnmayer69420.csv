I fucked around with 25mg for a while which my psych NP considered a ‚Äúbaby dose.‚Äù I took it before sleeping and it would pretty much glue me to my bed for the next 16 hours, when i finally got up I would be groggy, muscle achey, and zombieish. Got into my first ever car accident the day after taking a 50mg dose 6 months ago (which I blame on the seroquel). 100mg doses gave me the least side effects. It‚Äôs such a weird drug and  I would honestly love to learn about why it‚Äôs a completely different drug depending on the dosage. And by the way, if this post seems disorganized and jumbled, it‚Äôs because the drug still hasn‚Äôt entirely left my system yet

Just know that you don't need an official diagnosis to get treated (although most people would like one and I understand that) but you can search out DBT groups. Dialectical Behavioral Therapy is an evidenced-based therapy designed for those with BPD but is very helpful for people with Bipolar as well. See if you can join a group. A 20-week course is typically about $1k but could vary. DBT is very highly praised in the mental health community. Wish you the best of luck
