I do take measurements, with keeping in my mind that the calories burned feature on my watch is not entirely accurate. But with the decrease being consistent, I figured there's a pattern there. It is nice knowing that the 150 calorie difference is insignificant. I'm steadily increasing my weights and able to go for more sets!!

Two weeks after I lost my sister, my boyfriend at the time suggested that I should stop crying and start moving on with my life. I felt so hurt and frustrated from that, I still think about it to this day and it's been almost 7 years. I told him that he would never understand the pain I'm going through and how impossible it is to move on from something like this.

Something I started doing was exercising my mind to not keep me from doing things that would make me feel better. Like walking outside at a park, for example. I would get ready to go for a walk and end up staying home. I did this enough times and eventually went on that walk. It took weeks.

Hearing this come from many people should hopefully ease your mind and allow you to ENJOY this amazing progress. 

Another thing - maybe try skin tightening creams or serums? anything with Retinol or the words ""firming"" in them? Also using red light therapy.

I used to be really into athletics, weightlifting and nutrition before I became severely depressed so I understand that lifting and cardio won't be my saving grace to losing weight. 

I am in a deficit. I eat 1,200 calories per day and sometimes less. I do IF 12pm-6pm, and keep my carbs at a minimum and they're typically from whole food sources. 

I've been doing this consistently for two months, so I'm not worried about it considering I can definitely tell I've gained muscle in my arms. Just a matter of time before they start toning up.
A lot of it also my hormones. I have high cortisol levels and thankfully it's going down with time.

Unfortunately I've been through this struggle once before and I snapped right back into my ""ideal body"" within a year. This may go differently and may not be the same, but I've got confidence in myself.

Another thing is IF. I don't eat except for between noon and 6pm. Another thing, drink a TON of water. I drink a gallon and a half each day. Start slow with it. Each hour, drink a water bottle's worth (16.9oz). This will keep you fuller longer. 

I don't know what kind of job you have, but maybe ask HR to get you a desk extension so you're able to stand at your desk. If your workplace is lax, you can even get a desk treadmill that goes under your desk and extends out. Or a desk elliptical that goes under your desk."

If you're wanting to continue weightlifting but not get bulky, you'll have to cut, which is to say you'll have to restrict your calories. Try lowering your calories down to 1700 for a few weeks to a month, see how that goes, and then try lowering it to 1500. A typical cutting diet should only last 4-6 weeks for someone who isn't competing. If you aren't happy with the results, try extending it to 8 weeks.

Battling depression and anxiety is a tough enough feat as it is, and to top it off with developing an unhealthy weight can make you feel even worse. Someone on Reddit told me that the weight I gained was me overcoming my depression. I have to thank myself because I'm managing it better.

If you see my post history, you'll notice I am panicking because of my weight gain (5'1"", started at 120 and now I'm 170). 

As someone else mentioned here, be compassionate to yourself. You can become strong again. I know it sucks, but try going to the gym and doing light exercises for 30 min. If that's too much for you or you don't feel confident, go to Target or Walmart, get a pack of dumbbells for cheap, and start doing at-home workouts. Hell, even just walk around for 30 min will be great! Do this for a week or two and you'll notice yourself getting stronger. Try doing things that don't cause you to feel pain. My mom has arthritis, so she has to do exercises that will be easier on her joints. 

Something that helped me combat a similar circumstance is finding a hobby that got me out and about, and around other people. My weight gain made me feel ashamed to even be in public so this was an exercise that benefited my body and my mind, as my hobby is rock climbing. I also do spin classes because I love music, and it's dark so I can pay attention to myself and not to how others might be looking at me.

loseit,fb5jdzd,t1_fb5igpk,1576528730.0,"Yes, this is correct. And I haven't been eating back the calories I've burned off through exercise. I drink a gallon of water per day (always have). I drink my coffee black now.
I am very discouraged."
EOOD,f9hl5ma,t1_f9fab7s,1575316998.0,"Before I say anything further, your response seriously felt like a comfort blanket and I really appreciate the way you responded. 

About my weight... I also have to give myself credit because this was the morning after Thanksgiving before I had a chance to use the restroom, if you know what I mean. So that could’ve also played a part in the large number. I also drank half of a gallon of water but thought I’d peed it all out lol

Your point on beating depression... it’s not all gone but it’s like I’ve been able to channel my depression by doing things I enjoy with people I love and it’s been wonderful. My depression caused me to gain the weight in the first place which only led me to become more depressed. 
I hope with my recent muscle gains, this means that I can lose the fat weight. 

Currently, I am using MFP and a food scale to track calories. I’m also going to try replacing most of my meals with plant-based nutrients because of my digestion. Today was off because I had leftover chicken I didn’t want to waste. But I’m going to try to keep my calories between 1200-1400 and adjust as needed."

I just responded to the keto diet and unfortunately, I’m not someone who is able to do it. I’ve tried before and my doctor scolded me big time because it was causing health issues. 
I’ll lower my carbs though and make sure I’m getting my carbs from whole food sources instead of from processed or sugar sources. 

I’m not looking for fast results - I’m looking for sustainable ones even if they take awhile to come. 

I’ll look into those books!! I appreciate your feedback!"
EOOD,f94ptd1,t1_f943ku6,1575097549.0,"I unfortunately am one of the people who can’t do keto :( but I also don’t believe in dieting, just making smart and healthy decisions. Which granted, I haven’t been making lately. 

The trainer who took my weight said A) I don’t look like I weigh as much as I do, and B) that the weight gain could mostly be muscle as he could tell I have a lot of strength in my arm and back muscle groups, and when he had me do a leg extension compound exercise, I pushed 150lbs. So thankfully it could mostly be muscle that I’ve gained. 

I’m going to keep an eye on my calories and make sure I’m eating at a deficit so I can continue to work on building muscle but focus on leaning out as my priority first."
EOOD,f94poln,t1_f943lkp,1575097374.0,"It’s nice to know that it could be muscle. When I got weighed, the trainer who was assisting me said he could feel my back and arm muscles. When he had me to leg extensions, I was pushing 150lbs. So he mentioned the weight gain could be muscle and he said I didn’t look I weighed as much as I did, so that’s promising. 

Yeah, I just moved back closer to home and my friends have gotten me into beer and I’ve been drinking several times a week so that could also be the culprit. I’ll be using TDEE and MFP and hopefully I’ll get back on track!"

txstate,f35hmwv,t3_dfrgzl,1570677995.0,"Will you be living in an apartment with roommates or a dorm? Either way, both are subject to **Reasonable Accommodation** which prohibits discrimination of sexual orientation (among other things). 

As mentioned by another user, many at Texas State are accepting of members of the LGBT+ community, so more than likely, you will be okay. But if for some reason someone is uncomfortable with you being different than they are, please try to remember that it's their problem and not yours. It is not your obligation to ensure that your sexuality isn't an issue for someone else. It's 2019. You deserve to live the life you desire just like everyone else. If your roommate is uncomfortable with you, and they are amenable to having a conversation and understanding your circumstance, it could be a learning opportunity. But if it gets to a point where they're harassing you, endangering you, threatening you, PLEASE report it. Texas State is notorious for having underreported circumstances regarding harassment of the LGBT+ community and sexual assault. And please put yourself first and protect your safety. 

On another note, our campus has a really excellent counseling program, which includes **group counseling** where you get to meet other peers who are going through similar life instances as you. I joined the grief group and made friends there, two of which also belonged to the LGBT counseling group who made other friends, which in turn only caused me to make even MORE friends. It was great. 

I hope this helps."

I did Keto for over a year while being incredibly active. I found myself feeling fatigued every time I went to the gym and could only last 20 minutes. My doctor told me that Keto was not suitable for me for more than 6 weeks at a time and that I need more whole-food sourced carbs in my diet.

Fast-forward to today and I've gained weight (graduated college, too broke, etc) and my coworker tells me that I need to do Keto and goes on this hour-long rant about how there are multiple studies that PROVE FOR A FACT that we don't need carbs. God dude wouldn't shut up and took up my lunch."

3. Things just *look* different. They're the same, but I guess the way the sun shines and sets on everything is just cozier
4. One of the things I actually don't like about fall is that it gets darker sooner. I have depression and it gets worse in the fall because of the darkness. This year, though, I'm actually looking forward to it.
