Cinnamon is the usual for scent hallucinations.   
I've been alone in the bathroom and heard 3 knocks in a row, 3 times in the next stall and no one was there. I've heard a pile of books crash behind me when I was alone in the office and do not have books stacked. Heard a baby cry right behind me on the couch when I don't have a baby and it was in no way the TV as it was off. Usually my auditory hallucinations happen ""right behind"" me or next to me, but never in front of me. I think I would have more of them but I almost always have earbuds in with metal/rock music going. It seems to help block the hallucinations.

If I'm really stressed I get visual ones. Usually they are blob-shadow forms just in the corner of my eye that when I look at disappear. I've seen them crawl out of boxes, door frames, drip down the ceiling, etc. One of the strangest I've ever had though was I saw a box in the hallway glowing and sliding down the hall. That was the most detailed visual one I'd ever had. It actually made me laugh though because who the hell hallucinates a glowing box??

For the most part I'm alright with mine. The worst though was prior to diagnosis/medication I'd hear a voice that would always berate me. I hated that voice. Thanks to medicine that voice hasn't come back."

PlusSize,f0scv99,t1_f0rqpjv,1568902833.0,I second merrell. I walk 3-4 miles per day in mine and they never give. Only had to buy a new pair because I wore the soles out from so much use.
AmItheAsshole,f08b9kz,t1_f0809lt,1568478757.0,Your cat sounds amazing XD
AmItheAsshole,f08b069,t1_f07t2fe,1568478620.0,"One of my cats does this too. We had to get a giant plastic tub and a non-tippable dog bowl because he'd tip over all the other bowls (spilling the water everywhere) or 'punch' the water out of the bowl. He can still 'punch' the water out, but the tub makes cleanup easy - and keeps our floors from being damaged.  
I think my cat does it when he is bored. He spent over a year of his life in a tiny vet overnight cage (I do not know why the rescue allowed it, it was cruel) and he had no toys in the cage. When we first met him his newspaper matting was all soaked and he was soaked. I picked him up out of that cage and knew instantly I could never put him back - he was my baby from that moment on. We play with him daily (fetch, wands, etc) but when we are gone for work he resorts to water punching."

Metallica,ezn02or,t1_ezkmz9k,1567999136.0,This is exactly why they implemented a 1 per person limit. They announced it in the merch line and everyone cheered.

bipolar,ey905xf,t1_ey7484y,1566932259.0,"My grandma died at 82 after many years of very slow decline. While she was still somewhat lucid she'd complain of ""the gays"" kissing in her room (she was hallucinating/seeing things) and would become aggressive she was so angry about it. She eventually became completely blind and deaf, and would become so upset at something only she could see, screaming and crying until they'd sedate her. I'd rather die at 60 than go through that."
bipolar,ey8vntk,t3_cw0jw0,1566929353.0,"Dealing with this right now, myself. Not sure if it's the meds or what, but I just don't have passion for anything. It's not depression, it's just that I'm missing whatever it was that made life ""glow"""
AskReddit,ey8tqd3,t1_ey8qoil,1566928110.0,I'm probably one of the rare ones that agrees with you. It is very comforting to me to look at the stars and just remind myself how absolutely insignificant I am.
