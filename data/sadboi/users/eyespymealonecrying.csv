mentalillness,fi6hq29,t3_f6pyx2,1582195436.0,You should read “Everything is f*cked. A book about hope” by Mark Manson it’s a great read (and good to listen to as an audiobook!) and talks about this in depth!
mentalillness,fi6hfjk,t3_f6q0gw,1582195045.0,You should read “Everything is f*cked. A book about hope” by Mark Manson it’s pretty good and explains what’s happening with the world socially
ptsd,fi6a62n,t3_f6ia4u,1582185027.0,"(Trigger warning, suicide, self harm) Over four years ago now my then boyfriend was in the process of killing himself. I found him sitting in a tree, on a branch, with the rope in his hands and obviously went into overdrive to get him out of that situation. I climbed up the tree, made him undo the knots and hand the rope over to me - thankfully he didn’t kill himself and has sorted out his issues (think: finally hit rock bottom, saw how bad things were, and made an amazing recovery).
Needless to say it was an overly emotional and stressful time and I suffered hugely. My PTSD spiralled into major depression and anxiety issues. Shit hit the fan.
I was put on very heavy medication, dropped out of university, lost a lot of friends, visited more psychologists than I can count on two hands, self harmed, starved myself at a point, and pretty much became the shell of who I used to be. 
I could go into a lot more detail about the whole relationship and the problems that then arose from our mental health and the constant panic attacks at the thought of losing him but I digress. 

Flash forward over four years: I haven’t had a single panic attack since last November, I no longer need assurance of those around me that they won’t leave me, I’m in a new and much healthier relationship, I have left the mental health crisis team that I was under for more than two years, my last appointment with my specialist psychologist was over 6 months ago, and now I have just gone 1 WHOLE MONTH off of medication.

The best thing: learning skills to be able to help me reflect on difficult situations, like the one aforementioned, and now coming out the other side stronger and more prepared. 
Through therapy, I’ve learned to love all of me, even the parts I don’t necessarily like, how to deal with difficult and awkward situations that would normally trigger me and do so in a way that I would have never thought of before. I’ve learnt to accept my mental health issues and how to talk about them more openly and to not be ashamed of them. How to notice patterns that might lead to a spiral, and how to make sure it doesn’t spiral. 

I’ve come out so much stronger than when I started and that’s the biggest thing for me."

AmItheAsshole,fdu6kz7,t3_en0zfr,1578728484.0,"My very good friend died in a fatal car accident 6 days before Christmas. She was only 17 and had the world at her fingertips. Cause of crash is unclear as investigations are still ongoing but she was believed to be on her phone. 
She’s left behind a mother, father, and older brother who no longer know what to do with themselves. A family who now have to live without their shining star as she’s up in the night sky. She was the light of their lives.
She was the light of my life and anyone else she met. 
It’s been just over three weeks since she passed and everyone is still in this state of disbelief and shock. 
Yes people go one their phones whilst driving but they are one simple slip-up away from ending it all when they do so. 
The sadness and grief and pain you feel will never disappear but they will. 
Don’t let your daughter become another statistic that we scare others with.

Edit:

Mum and daughter - YTA for not taking it seriously
Dad - NTA but perhaps could’ve gone about it in a different manner"
