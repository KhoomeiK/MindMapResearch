Instead of just the blanket, consider getting a sleeping bag rated for whatever temperature you'll be facing, and maybe a buddy heater. During downtime utilize libraries and/or rec centers. 

Msg me if you need and check out /r/vandwellers they have a ton of good tips and resources and such."

Good job with building the counter space. I like the plugged in cooler idea with ice. How do you have your curtains secured? The heat was always the biggest challenge for me. Thank you for sharing!"

I think most of us with setups like cots and a few storage bins and accessories just lay low, I personally never felt my setup was really worth posting, since it's so basic."
