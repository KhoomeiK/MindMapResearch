went out to lunch with a friend, kept dramatically looking over my shoulder cause I had just told her I have issues with psychotic symptoms but it was pre-dx so I got paranoid she'd not believe me so I had to ""prove it"" to her but in reality I'm sure I just looked, ironically, like I was faking.

not to mention all the oversharing I did, some of it was, in hindsight, delusional. like, I told her about self harm and my parents, but also about >!being molested at a birthday party as a kid!< but I don't think that actually happened. idk how she's still my friend honestly

I also thought there was gonna be a shooter at my school so I constantly hid and didn't pay attention in class cause I was so worried. but, at the same time, I thought I was destined to be the next major school shooter so I was also constantly worried and guilty about that. can't really explain that to a concerned teacher.

last thing, cause tons of cringe is coming to mind but I don't want to actually write a novel here: I didn't want to go home after school and had a delusion that my science teacher cared way more about me than she did, so I stayed in her classroom after school for like an hour everyday for weeks until she clearly started showing disdain. then I started skipping class and completely ignoring her cause I was sure (and still am) that she hated my guts

that's a graphic that ranks the ten deadliest u.s. domestic extremists from 1966-2017. data from 1966 isn't relevant to the modern climate, and a list ranking the deadliest attacks doesn't say anything about the ideologies of most domestic terrorists. you can't assume facts about the whole with data from a few, you have to look at the big picture.

sidenote you denied the rape but not the rightwing and racist parts

and the reason I asked why you're here is cause biden has [outright](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/joe-biden-sanders-americans-aren-t-looking-revolution-n1143681) opposed [revolution](https://www.axios.com/biden-sanders-democratic-debate-25b8b937-2943-416d-b359-b115f40b526a.html). he's a conservative, he wants to conserve the status quo. revolution is about bucking the status quo for a better future for the citizens of the world

we probably do both want what's better for everyone, but I think we have pretty close to opposite visions for what that looks like and/or what will bring it"
ShitLiberalsSay,fqejy3z,t1_fo5efnq,1589308798.0,"my parents grew up poor, I grew up lower-middle class. my mom is a socialist cause she remembers how much it sucked being poor. my dad is conservative libertarian and says I'm a deluded college lib for being far left cause he pulled himself up by his bootstraps so other poor people must just be lazy. my brother's bordering on fasc btw, just so you have a glimpse into how political discussions go in our family. literally every quadrant of the political compass covered lol

now I just need to buy the dog a grill and we'll complete our polcom collection"
ShitLiberalsSay,fqeisrs,t3_g5b3gb,1589308252.0,"aww, guys, they think we can do it in a day. how sweet"
ShitLiberalsSay,fqei0z0,t3_gblmrh,1589307888.0,"the dude literally was like ""let's come together and defeat our oppressors"" and motherfucker somehow thought ""hey! that's so divisive! why can't we *befriend* the people working us to death for an unusable amount of wealth??"""
ShitLiberalsSay,fqeh8ol,t1_fotqp65,1589307517.0,just had some biden supporter ask me if biden has been convicted for rape as though that means anything lol no neither has trump who you do agree is a rapist so maybe have consistent morals bro
Political_Revolution,fqeh11v,t1_fqeg45z,1589307417.0,"oh. you're not a resigned leftist. you're just a bidenbro.

what are you doing in a sub for political revolution then"
BreadTube,fqefgkh,t1_fq8h0to,1589306673.0,"btw I'm still trying to get through people's heads that even when you talk about her past you still call her Caitlyn and use she/her pronouns. they always say ""but she was him back then!"" and I don't know how to explain that's neither correct nor relevant"
Political_Revolution,fqef0sy,t1_fqean3u,1589306465.0,"exactly, I said I'm an accelerationist lol I wasn't being sarcastic

they're the same politically, biden's policies would be indistinguishable from trump's. neither of them would work to fix anything that's wrong with this country. and honestly, trump is a great face for America, he perfectly represents us. fat, greedy, dumb, narcissistic, stubborn, and standing on the shoulders of slavery. that's the American way!

we've been put into a possession where we have to choose between two rightwing, racist, rapists. I'm not gonna vote for the blue one or the red one cause there's nothing that can get me to vote for such a person. I don't want to ever have to look back and know I voted for a rapist, even if the only other option was also a rapist."
Political_Revolution,fqe9hk3,t1_fqdseyg,1589303927.0,"I think most people on this sub will still vote blue no matter who. I think it's silly cause that's just telling the DNC ""if you step on me, I will still do what you want."" 

plus, biden and trump are the same to me. their policies are going to be the same, only difference is trump will more directly support and encourage the alt right but at this point they've woken up and a democrat in office won't suddenly fix that. I kinda hope trump wins even though I hate him and everything he stands for, cause I know the second he's out most people will stop caring about all the tragedies he's taking part in (the kids in cages, cutting budgets to public services, worsening climate change, façade of goodwill (sometimes) followed by hypocritical actions, etc) even though *every* president has done this sorta stuff. they just haven't had such punchable personalities."
EDanonymemes,fqct9xj,t1_fptktt8,1589268197.0,"not encouraging anything, I mean in a healthy way, have you tried lifting? I've heard that most of the time with stuff like ""skinny but still don't have tiny upper arms,"" it's not that the ""fat"" comes from someone being fat, it's that they lack muscle tone. I hope this doesn't come across as a tip or anything, that's not my intention at all"
socialism,fqcsoif,t1_fnwdsln,1589267638.0,"only time I'll ever say this, but I think bezos would actually be the best billionaire. Elon clearly doesn't with out, most the other ones are either old or also out of shape. if you're gonna give bezos anything, it's that he's certainly making sure he can serve a village

(btw FBI agent, as a vegan, this is all hypothetical. I'd rather we use the corpses of the rich for art and research ✌️😊)"
antiwork,fqcs9w2,t1_fo5isx7,1589267261.0,"I like Pete Davidson. I just saw a bunch of people hating on him on Twitter and idgi so I thought I'd take this moment of slight relevance to counter the seemingly unwarranted hate he gets. I think it comes from his SNL days which is dumb cause imo he was the best member on the show at the time and it's still the shittest thing he's ever done. you can't really blame the cast for bad writers

sorry for the tangent lol just feel bad for the guy"
COMPLETEANARCHY,fqcrtyl,t1_fp46p7o,1589266855.0,I wouldn't be able to hang with chill origami people if I knew there was a good chance outside of folding paper they're calling for the extinction of minorities
Political_Revolution,fqcr9so,t1_fpovo0a,1589266345.0,"of course not, I'm an accelerationist. this is a win-win situation for us."
beholdthemasterrace,fqcl25w,t1_fmw7hkv,1589261070.0,"i agree. the use of the m-slur really caught me off guard. people really don't have much respect for people with dwarfism, even in progressive communities. it's really sad. i hope ableism is addressed soon cause it's fucked up, people with physical and mental disabilities and illnesses are treated like dogshit for something that literally already inherently makes life harder. wtf"
schizophrenia,fqaw703,t1_fqaav5t,1589226345.0,"look, no offense man, but why did you come here for advice if you're gonna reject everything people say? i think you really do need to slow down before you do something you regret. i don't think you're in a great state right now and you should really think about that before making rash decisions

best of luck, man. be careful"
