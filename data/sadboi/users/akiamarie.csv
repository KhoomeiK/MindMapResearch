rapecounseling,fm2q9sp,t3_fsjmlg,1585702931.0,I think you have to fully process your trauma for that to happen. I froze all 3 times i was raped and last time i went dancing a creep grabbed me and i just violently pushed him off and said fuck off and told the bouncer he was handsy. I never would have done that before. But after mourning and grieving and processing I feel better and shut creeps down without hesitation.
bipolar,flvjxzv,t3_fr7op0,1585525455.0,I feel like all the anxiety is keeping me hyped and pushing me towards mania. It sucks but hopefully we will be done soon

bipolar,f9v9ws9,t3_e6zpmj,1575665690.0,My old psyc dr ignored me when i said i want to try lithium. We had tried so many new things and none of them were working. She finally prescribed it after 3 months of hell. And I'm a mostly functioning person now and my new psyc dr has gotten me to the perfect therapeutic dose and this is the most stable I've been since i was diagnosed. I am a fan if Lithium. Its the best!!!
BipolarReddit,f8xghyd,t1_f8xcxk3,1574918064.0,Yeah it sucks because i know that im a rational person but today my brain is not letting that happen. And trying to articulate that to another human is hard af especially when its difficult to make a sentence.

BipolarReddit,f7cmv75,t3_dvasrb,1573595701.0,"I get like that sometimes too. One thing i find that helps is to soul search a little bit because there's usually something that's weighing on me that i just haven't addressed. 

And if i feel like that's going to take me to a dark place i go just exist in the same room as my best friend that way she knows im not hurting myself and any thought i have i can ask her about or we can have a discussion. The last time this happened we ended up diving into some documentary about how God is an alien. So it might help you find some joy. 

Good luck friend. This will pass. Do future you a solid and put all your energy into your interview and then take a nap. You got this!!"
TalesFromThePharmacy,f76cdsl,t3_dub8tz,1573426366.0,"I had a guy call on Wednesday about prices for medications with his new insurance plan and i explained that i couldn't do that without an actual Rx. He still wanted to know prices. So i was stuck on the phone with this man who said he could only take mylan brand of one medication because it wasn't made in India. That med is on back order and he didnt want to accept that. I said "" i literally have no idea if or when it will be available"". He said ""oh maybe that will change by the 1st of the coming year. that's when I'll need it"". We finally got off the phone and we all think this is done.
The next day he comes in 15 minutes before closing and talks to our pharmacist again about all the information we gave him yesterday. And the next day he came with scripts for copays and i explained that this will not be accurate for whatever new insurance you get. And he was suprised because the rep told him otherwise. And then proceded to ask more irrelevant questions despite the fact that one of my co works said im gonna clock out have a good weekend and my pharmacist closing and locking the front doors."
TalesFromThePharmacy,f5luf1p,t1_f5l8mek,1572283409.0,I did this with oxy 10 and 5. It was a rough day
BipolarReddit,f53hybo,t3_dmlvqm,1571959968.0,I've been there. I still havent finished my degree because the stress of school makes my mood change so rapidly and i can never seem to get my thoughts together or even slow them down enough to effectively study. I was getting C's and D's despite how much i studied. And i was a straight A student before. I had to medically withdraw twice. It's almost impossible to take on the stress of rigorous classes without being semi-stable. My advice is to take a break and sort out your mental health first.

 So remember how you were feeling, your mindset, and any external factors and just rationalize how you were feeling in the moment. Then compare it to how you feel about it now and just unpack all the shame and regret and just get into it experence all of it. And then remember that this has already happened and you cannot change that but you can use what you've learned to prevent future destructive behavior. 

Its a process and anytime i have flashbacks or ruminations i go throught the process or if its at an inopportune time i just say ""this has happened already and i can't change it"" and come back to it later. 

It a long and continuous process but eventually you remember that mistakes are ok. And if whoever you've hurt believes you're worthy of forgivness or wants to repair your relationship believe that you can forgive yourself too and with time you will."

My therapist told me to do that about panic attacks and it helps when you're feeling shitty too. And if you need a mental health day just take it. Call in sick no one questions tummy issues. And i schedule a mental health day once a month at work. Sometimes i go to the doctor but it's mostly me spending time with myself and decompressing.
