It follows the standard of 2/2/2 and simply has one half without risk of losing / gaining rank. The biggest difference will be the amount of tryharding that goes on.

Of course there's also the fact that an entire 90% of the community doesn't think they should be hardstuck and it's just their team. If that's you, you're washed garbage. You deserve your current rank. You will never climb. You need to have a growth mindset if you ever want to climb. Of course you can blame your team.

EscapefromTarkov,fflc676,t1_ffj37qq,1580037706.0,"Amazing. Every word of what you just said was wrong.

First, let me address going to take 5/6 slots on factory. If you're going to factory as a squad of FIVE people, you're going to be wiping SCAVS and maybe a single player. Where's the loot here? I can make a solo HATCHLING run on Interchange and in half the time earn LITERALLY ten times the amount.

Continuing on with this, if there's only one player (and say he came in fully geared), who gets to take his level 6 armor? Who gets to take his level 6 helmet? Typically, it's the person who kills that gets to loot. That makes Factory a TERRIBLE map for 5 mans.

Now let's talk about ""I even tried grouping up in larger groups of 4 and 5.""

Right, you tried it once or twice, right? Then you just automatically assumed everything was easy and nobody could lose?

Let me tell you a story on Shoreline with a five-man. We were waiting on a friend to load in who has a dogshit PC so we were already about five minutes late getting there. I brought some gen 4 with a Vulkan-5. I had all the meds I could possibly want for that raid - I was relaxing.

As soon as we arrived at resort, the best player in our squad was sprayed down and killed. So now whoever is at the resort has killed the person who was practically leading comms and we're in a 4vX, we didn't know how many there were.

We were positioned outside the gate just trying to get in. We sat there, taking a few pop-shots every once in a while as we tried to locate the PMC. When they didn't show, I decided to bite the bullet. I told my squad ""I'm pushing in, listen for gunshots and fuck the guy up.""

So I ran straight through the broken part of the wall and immediately got to cover. My suspicion was that there was another player to my right, but they didn't shoot when I ran past. Nonetheless, I peeked the angle and sure enough, there he was. I sprayed him down and my squad got access in. We still had a battle to go through with another three or four man that raid, unsure of the player count.

Why am I showing you this example?

Because I intentionally went in, thinking I was going to die, to let my squad get the upper hand. But it wasn't a squad decision, it was individual. The skill ALWAYS rests with the individual.

I didn't expect my team to back me up there. I expected them to avenge me. I really didn't expect to have my loot returned, given the skill of the people who were in the squad.

The most important thing to note there is that a squad does one thing:

It lets you know when there's an enemy killing. You'd just better hope that you're not the first to get picked off or you get nothing from the raid.

There's really only one thing that you said which is partially correct. Five-mans let you have great insurance. Kind of true, but not really. Your five-man has to stay alive and LOOT YOUR BODY, which is not always possible.

Assume you die at the bottom of the escalators near TechLight. You're not sure how many people are above, but you know that's where you were killed from. Your squad CANNOT push there and loot you without fucking dying.

They have the high ground.

Positioning far outweighs numbers. Patience far outweighs numbers. Game knowledge far outweighs numbers.

I've wiped three out of five people in a five-man before the rest just ran. That's how it is. Five mans are glorified ""instant win"" buttons when in reality they're just alarms to whether or not you're in danger.

Yes, please do educate yourself on this matter because your ""I even tried grouping up in larger groups of 4 and 5"" doesn't make you very experienced - and thus educated - on this argument.

Yours Truly,

An asshole who just so happens to be correct.

(""See how cringy that is? It's pretty cringe friend. Have a nice day."" - glad you understood the point of the message, but you're not my friend. Go die to more five-mans and whine more about no skill.)"

Solos have to be more observant and aware, but other than that, they will never have the delayed reactions that a squad has in seeing any other PMC at close range. There are trade-offs to both styles of play.

Overwatch,ff7hl63,t1_ff7gm6n,1579649726.0,"The point of re-listing heroes was to give an idea of who would be in the game without the banned heroes. It helps to have a visual comparison since it's humanly impossible to keep all of the DPS heroes that aren't banned in your brain at one time.

I apologize for the pointlessly long parts (such as the list which you can definitely skip over if you know all the heroes like you mentioned) and that you felt it was a rant against Sigma and Orisa, but it is the problem and Blizzard isn't fixing it properly. Giving the tools to the player base will allow us to subvert the problem without having to wait years for proper nerfs.

EscapefromTarkov,fdlg9n4,t3_ell1qt,1578523377.0,"Tarkov currently has one player model. I like that. It makes the fights consistent and the focus less on how your character looks and more how your guns appear. It makes the actual in-game economy have meaning when showing off beautiful builds.

Mainly, my problem lies in the fact that basically every female player model is *smaller* than the male one with absolutely zero drawbacks. If you think that doesn't make a difference, then you haven't played Rainbow Six: Siege. Tarkov is harder than Siege. Much harder. Making different hitboxes is - in my opinion - detrimental to the game's health. Forcing everybody to have identical hitboxes is one of the best balances that Tarkov has.

Change this and suddenly Tarkov has a fucking META defined by the sex of your character. Are you joking? Additionally, I will say that female voice lines would be incredibly annoying in the game after playing with only male voice lines to this point. The male ones are just so much more intimidating and I really can't imagine a way that they'd implement ""FUCK YOU SCAV!"" to females without it being immersively breaking."

I personally don't think she's transgender given the many ways that you can interpret the scene. She could be, and I wouldn't be surprised if she is, but with so many interpretations, nobody can say she is one specific thing.
The only reason I bring that kind of logic into question is to show how the scene can be interpreted in many different ways.
