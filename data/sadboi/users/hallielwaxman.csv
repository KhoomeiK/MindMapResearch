""You're not living with your grandparents anymore. You shouldn't be sad."" ""Don't let it control you."" ""Find your motivation.""

And my personal favorite: ""Just Fucking stop being sad.""

So you coming here, asking for advice from others for the sake of your child, AMAZING. My advice? Be the polar opposite of my father. If she feels comfortable enough with opening up, don't shut her down. I told my dad I was depressed, and he proceeded to play ""Who's Dick Is Bigger"" with sad stories. His parents died within months of each other (he was almost 40 years old with a daughter, NOT a sixteen year old girl who wanted to kill herself because she doesn't think she's worth the air she breathes). 

So where you might think you're potentially sympathizing with her, be careful what you share,  it could make it worse. But you're trying to do what you can (unlike most), and she'll thank you one day. I definitely wish I had a father like you three years ago."

It was my first year of college, and we had a game room. I walked in, saw 5 pool tables, and saw a couple of guys playing. I asked if I could join. They were hesitant, but after a second, they let me. One of the guys asked for my number. I told him that of he beat me, he could have my number. On top of that, we placed bets. 5 bucks for each of them if I lost, ten for me if I won. 

They weren't awful, but they were way too full of themselves to actually play strategically. They focused more on easier shots than setting themselves up for the next shot, and often blocked their own shots, forcing a scratch. 

I, on the other hand, did no such thing. I didn't clear the table.. At first. I let them win the first game. I purposely made it so a ball was right in front of the pocket, but didn't go in. I made a few to make it look like I could kinda play. 

I wish I could say I ran the table the next game, but I didn't. But it was really close to that. I made bank shots. I blocked their shots. I called the pocket on the 8 ball. Everything. 

I got my money, and the guy never got my number. I also never saw them play pool again."

Don't get me wrong. The plot is awful. The acting is sub-par (for earlier films at least). And there's very little character development. 

HOWEVER. 

I (19F) was bullied in school. Elementary, all the way through high school. I didn't have any friends. So I read. And I refused to read/watch/listen/do whatever was in the status quo. Everyone and their mother was reading the Harry Potter series, so I read the Twilight series. Those were the first books I read that I could get lost in and completely forget how shitty my life was at the time. And then once the movies came out, I watched them over and over. Read the books forwards and backwards, in every combination you could think of. Those books were my escape from reality. And the movies didn't quite have the same effect, because all the mental images were made up for me, but it was the fact that it was still part of that series that helped me get through school."
