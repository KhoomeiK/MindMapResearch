TL;DR ask your lady why she needs to see your phone, and try to find a common ground to establish trust and confidence.

It sounds like your girlfriend is insecure. She clearly wants to make sure that you aren’t crossing boundaries with other women. You should ask her, “Why do you think I might be cheating? What can we do to assuage your fears?” Note the WE in that sentence: she needs to work on her confidence as well. She may even need to see a therapist if she is extremely worried/obsessed over the idea of you cheating on her.

I don’t like giving my partners my phone because it has private conversations on them. Between my friends, my family, online... I’m just not comfortable with the idea of my partner digging through and analyzing my data. I often talk to my friends about sensitive subjects. I often Google embarrassing things (ie “definition judicious”) — and I think that some of those stupid Google searches, or porn preferences, or other trivial Internet things should be kept private. I truly have nothing to hide from my boyfriend — I would happily let him scroll through it all if he really needed to — it’s just my pride.

HOWEVER. I also see your girlfriend’s side. I was in a horrible relationship that was FULL of distrust. Long story short, he made me feel like trash, and I wanted to go through his phone/computer so, so bad. I was certain that he was talking shit about me / flirting with other women.

In my current relationship, I know he isn’t cheating on me and vice versa. We are honest and transparent about our feelings, good and bad. I’ve never asked to look through his texts, nor has he looked through mine. We know we need a degree of privacy. So we started reassuring each other from the beginning."

The first question: An ignorant numbnut who can’t even use Google. I’m not even American, and I can name a few “bad things”. I wouldn’t want to respond to you because where even do I start?! Someone with the patience of a kindergarten teacher can answer instead of me...
In your second example of the blender, this is like asking, “How do I use my blender?” and my answer would be, “What do you mean? Read your fucking user manual, dipshit.”

The second question: A right-winger or centrist who is feeling frisky; you want someone to argue with you. The people you’d attract are not going to be patient, and are not going to talk to you like you’re 5; they’re going to insult you, they’re going to talk from a high horse, and they may pick and choose their sources.
In your blender example, you might get people who know how to rewire their blender to make one of the buttons play Africa by Toto, and they’ll use complicated vocabulary to make you feel like a moron.

I find the best way is to be specific. “Trump killed 1,000 baby panda bears via AR-15, and I know that’s bad, but why is everyone mad that it wasn’t eco-friendly?!” would get more precise responses than “Why shouldn’t we kill panda bear babies?”"

I've had my own experiences with violent death. The grief truly knocks the wind out of you, and there's nothing but time that can make it easier; I remember trying to talk about my sadness with friends, and all they could do was look at me with pity and say ""Oh that sucks"".

I promise you can heal. You'll never forget her, but you'll find yourself.

There's a resource that I used during a horrible time of grief and guilt. It's a 12- or 16-step process of writing letters to yourself, to your family, to the person responsible, and to your loved one. I can look for it if you're interested. It's not an official therapeutic resource, it was just from a forum, but it was cathartic to express all of the feelings I kept inside.

Like you, I need time to recharge my batteries or I get short-tempered. My boyfriend is an affectionate chatterbox. I let him know when I need quiet time, and he goes into the other room to play games. I also have mental health issues, so when I'm not feeling like myself, I tell him and he is very attentive.

It's confusing to me that your boyfriend is offended by your habits. It sounds like you've been clear by telling him exactly when you need alone time and why, and yet it doesn't seem to matter to him.

In my opinion, he feels cooped up in a new living situation but isn't as in tune with his feelings as you are. What I mean is that you know when you're starting to feel uneasy/stressed, you know why, and you know how to handle it. Maybe he feels cooped up in a new living situation but doesn't know how to handle feelings of loneliness/frustration when you spend time away from him. And it ended up blowing out of proportion when it didn't have to.

Some time apart for self-reflection sounds like a good thing for both of you. I wouldn't immediately think that the relationship is over, because he could apologize, so feel free to keep that door open. But **in the end, he does need to respect your needs.** If he wants you to constantly hang around with him and listen to him talk about things you aren't interested in, then he might as well have a mannequin sit next to him.

I used the example of the shop owner because of the sentiment that giving people can never get rich in the first place. They would recognize that the money they don’t need for themselves and their loved ones could meet the basic needs of others. The idea is that they wouldn’t accumulate more money than they could spend because they would perceive that as wasteful. (And, for the record, lower-middle class isn’t poverty.)

Additionally, how is the fact that many charities are corrupt a reason not to donate to good causes? Because Greenpeace and the WWF and PETA are sketchy, we shouldn’t bother trying to contribute to the causes we care about? That’s bologna. For every big charity that pours money into sponsorships and advertising and “administrative fees”, there are dozens of smaller, local charities that are doing a better job. The only thing holding someone back is either a lack of research into charities or a lack of interest in donating.

And yes, it is a cruel power to be able to choose who is “worthy” of financial support and who isn’t at his level. My extra pocket change for charity is *nothing* compared to his life-changing pocket change.

I’m aware that if Gates’ money went into one place — or even 100 places — all at once, it would be too much money all at once to be used effectively.

I listened and waited for the perfect targets: naïve young women and men trying both to court each other and prove their courage by sitting around a ouija board in the dark. It was classic and easy. They spoke to me, I spoke to them, and they accused each other of playing pranks. I fought my way to the door between their plane and mine, prematurely tasting victory. I clung to the girl holding the planchette, eager to harness her fear to fuel my power.

Oh how disappointed I was to find that centuries had turned humans from quivering and god-fearing into indifferent, dopamine-seeking creatures. They weren’t afraid of the dark, superstition, pagans, or mystery like they used to be. In the 16th century I had been almighty. I was nearly impossible to catch and exorcize... I escaped returning to Hell countless times.

And yet, Lisa seemed an insurmountable task.

On the second night, when I felt I was firmly planted in the material plane, I began my work on weakening her constitution. It took her a long time to fall asleep, but at three in the morning, I had my first chance.

I pushed a glass jar from one of the top cupboards. It shattered entirely when it hit the floor, spraying brine and pickled vegetables in all directions. I listened, and I was pleased that I’d woken her up.

She skittered into the kitchen and flipped the light on. “Pingu?!” she called.

I’d made an amateur mistake: anything I did outside of her vision would be blamed on the cat. Drat.

The following days, I watched her closely. She slept in, she ate, she slept, she smoked an herb, she watched a film, she looked at her cellular phone, she looked out the window, she ate...

She made no attempt to leave. Her tuxedo cat spent as much time by her side as by himself, so I tried to keep careful track of him.

On the fifth day, while Lisa watched another movie, I wanted to make up for my earlier failure. I took hold of her bedframe and shook it back and forth, making the springs squeak, for a few seconds. It took a fair amount of strength, but her fear would be more than enough to gain it back... Or so I though.

Lisa picked up her phone. “Hey Siri. Text Mom. Yo I think we just got an earthquake question mark. Send.”

She resumed her movie looking quite not-scared. I clenched my teeth and growled to myself, at which point Lisa looked up and shouted, “Pingu? Are you growling at me buddy? It’s not suppertime yet.”

I mustered up the strength for one more try that night. Right as Lisa slipped into REM sleep, I took hold of her ankles as hard as I could and dragged her from the bed. She woke up and yelped when her head hit the floor, much to my pleasure. To my displeasure, however, she lugged herself back under the covers without hesitation.

The next morning, she called someone on her phone. “I had *the* craziest dream last night and guess what. No, even funnier,” she said, beginning to giggle. “I fell out of my fucking bed! Can you believe that? I haven’t fallen out of bed since I was, like, eleven.”

She didn’t even notice the bruises because she didn’t shower for three days.

It took a while for me to plan my next move. I needed her fear or I would fade into a pathetic shadow of the demon I wanted to be, and I wasn’t very strong after my resurgence to begin with.

I was ready a week later. Unexpectedly, Lisa went out one evening and didn’t return until very late. She collapsed into bed, still wearing her clothes, and fell asleep immediately. I placed my gnarled hands on her bare shoulders, and raked my nails down her arms, leaving bright red welts in their wake. To my dismay, she didn’t even stir, but I had some hope for the next morning’s revelation.

Lisa sat up in the afternoon and started smoking, probably before she was fully conscious. She leaned back on her pillow and exhaled, lying there for a while before taking another hit. I tried to fight my impatience as I waited.

It was when she leaned over to the ashtray that she caught a glimpse of the marks on her smooth skin. She examined herself for a few moments before muttering, “What the fuck?”

She picked up her phone. “Hey Siri. Call Adam From Lab 2. Hey, it’s me. Dude, did you scratch me last night? I appreciate the passion, but this isn’t very cool...”

I decided to take that damned phone. That would be the way to get her attention. I was driven by frustration; as soon as she set the phone down after talking to Adam From Lab 2, I snatched it. I rushed to a different room - any room would do - and left it under a stack of textbooks.

It took six hours for Lisa to notice and two more for her to care enough to get up. She clicked a button on her laptop and the phone - that was supposed to be hidden - started making noises. She found it in no time.

“Did I...?” She scratched her head. “Did I do that...?”

I could have screamed."

The young man’s footsteps left my bedroom and stopped a few feet away in the hall. I tried to catch my breath but the fright of a stranger appearing out of thin air while I was bare-ass-naked was strong. I instinctively felt around the floor beside me before I realized I left my phone on my nightstand; if I walked over to that side of my room, I would be in the man’s field of view.

I tried to shake off my jitters and summon some confidence. My second-storey window was maybe fifteen feet off the ground... I began to weigh my chances of running on a broken ankle.

“Listen, Miss, I honestly didn’t mean to intrude,” came the stranger’s shaky, embarrassed voice. “Please let me explain.”

My fear turned into rage in a split second. Did he trip and *accidentally* commit breaking and entering?! Did he turn left instead of right and OOPS I’m in a woman’s bedroom?!

“Get the fuck out of my house or you’ll have to explain to the local police department!” I stood up and began to wrestle with a sweater.

“I’m from the year 2320-“

“And my mom’s the president.”

“-and I came here by a chronoporter and I honestly didn’t mean to end up in here I actually wanted to knock on your front door-“

I finally managed to pull some track pants over my legs and I stomped out of the closet towards the source of the voice. “GET. OUT. OF. MY-“

As soon as the young man caught sight of me - long hair still wet and wild from my shower, spittle flying off my lips, fists clenched, eyes wide and feral - he tripped over his own feet scrambling backwards.

“Please!” he begged, holding his hands up. “I swear I didn’t mean to scare you!”

I halted. We stared at each other. I crossed my arms.

“Okay, asshole, what did you ‘mean’ to do?”

He lowered his hands and licked his lips. He was handsome: curly blonde hair, blue eyes. His fragile face reminded me of that guy in the Fantastic Beasts movie. (...What was his name? I’ll have to look it up later when my house isn’t being invaded by delusional teenagers.) He wore jeans but with stripes of something that looked like carbon fibre. He wore knee-high brown, suede boots that looked like Oxfords at the bottom. His shirt was a regular black sweater except the sleeves were attached with zippers. He wore purple glasses with a sharp cat-eye point on the corner of each lens. Certainly, it wasn’t the strangest outfit I’d seen, but I still judged the tacky, ‘cyberpunk’ vibe he was obviously trying for.

“I told y-you,” he stuttered, “I wanted to talk to you so I was going to knock on your door, but the chronoporter sent me into your room. I didn’t mean to!”

“A chronoporter? Is this a *joke*?”

“No! Hang on... Hang on!”

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a very ergonomic remote control. He offered it to me, and I allowed myself to step forward and take it.

It was heavy. It had a green dial and a colourful strip of glass. I rotated it in my hands, but no matter the angle, I didn’t recognize what it was for or how it worked. I glared at him.

“I know you’ve never seen anything like that before,” he said as fast as his mouth would allow him, “but it’s for a-a-a gadget that was invented in the 2200’s that can let you visit different years-“

“A time machine. You’re telling me you have a time machine.”

“Yeah! I mean...” His facial expression shifted from happiness to wariness in an instant as he caught on to my skepticism. “You could call it a time machine...”

He was so deep in his delusion that I began to worry. He was clearly mentally ill; maybe he was having an episode, or forgot to take his medications, or both... He needed to go back to where he came from to get some help.

“Okay. I’ll humour you. Let’s say you do have a *time machine*. Who are you?” I leaned against the hallway wall.

“I’m Tungel.”

I nearly snorted. Tungel. Like the unflattering nickname for Tumblr, ‘tungl dot hell’. Who named their kid ‘Tungel’?! It reminded me of Norman Reedus’ son, Mingus Reedus. Or that stupid meme, Scrummy Bungus And The Crungy Spungus or something equally nonsensical. Really? Tungel?

I somehow managed to keep a straight face. “Okay, Tungel, what are you doing here?”

“A school project. It’s for World History Post-Y2K, I need to study a historical figure, and I’ve always been a fan of yours, but I guess that’s weird since you don’t even know who I am...”

“Yeah. It’s weird.”

I took a step back towards my bedroom when Tungel shouted, “WAIT!” and grabbed my wrist. In my shock, I froze for a moment, and he managed to press a button on his remote. Our surroundings turned monochrome and the outer edges of my vision was blurry, as if I was peering through a fisheye lens.

“Sorry,” he muttered as I wrested my arm out of his grasp. “I just need you to believe me.”

“What have you done?” I gasped. I noticed my feet were glued to the floor.

“I just paused time, don’t worry, it’ll only last a short while.”

He really did have some kind of magic contraption. (Or I’m going insane. I think I’m going insane. Did I drop acid this morning without knowing it?)

“What do you want from me?”

“I just want to talk to you about your blog over a coffee or lunch.”

“My...my blog?”

“Yeah. It was one of the only comprehensive internet relics pre-2100. As far as we know, everything else was lost to the Neo-Fascist Data Deletion.”

“The WHAT?” (I’m either asleep, drugged, or I need to be committed to a psychiatric ward A-S-A-fucking-P.)

“Oh shit...” He looked at his watch. “What year is it?”

“2020...” I began to feel faint.

“Oh fuck, oh fuck.” He ran his fingers through his hair. “I thought this was 2030, I must’ve made a typo. Shit! Okay.” Tungel turned to me. “Listen, everything’s cool, I’m gonna fix this.”

I didn’t notice him reach into his other pocket and withdraw a small, metal sphere. I didn’t notice it until he brought it up towards his face. Something clicked, and it opened facing me.

(Is this a goddamned Men In Black memory thi-)

It flashed."

relationships,fo4ml3w,t3_g5f5e0,1587507160.0,"Hey darling,

I know how you feel. You know who you fell in love with, and sometimes you still feel that pure, wonderful bliss with him when he is good to you. You want to work with him to try to get back the affection and kindness and respect that you had in the beginning. You want to find out what changed and try to fix it.

But at the end of the day, if he swears at you and hits you and neglects your mental health, he doesn’t respect you. When someone doesn’t respect you, they certainly aren’t going to cooperate with you to change their behaviour.

If you try to talk to him about why his behaviours bother you and he turns it into a tirade about how it’s all your fault, he doesn’t want to change. He wants you to be his doormat so he can do and say whatever he wants without consequences. He has demonstrated that he doesn’t care about how his actions affect other people. I’m going to say what other commenters have said: it’s abusive. You need to get out. I know how hard it is to realize, but I’ve been in your shoes. I was with that man for 6 years. I wish I could get those years back. Leaving him was one of the hardest things I’ve ever done, but I’m a much healthier and happier woman for it.

Your boyfriend likes who he is and there’s nothing you can do about that. You could suggest he gets therapy, but unless he actually wants to improve himself it won’t help; he will go and “check the box” to “make you happy”.

The only thing you can change is yourself. You know your mental health, and if he threatens you while you’re manic, then that’s harmful. You need to protect yourself. If you can’t trust him to keep you safe during your episodes (or, god forbid, you don’t trust him not to trigger you) then it’s not good for you to be around him at all. I know it’s a hard realization, but it really took me to the point of suicide to finally break up with my ex. He was absolutely toxic for me, and I don’t want you to feel stuck they way I did.

There are people out there that love you and wouldn’t dream of hurting you. A relationship does not have to have violence, insults, or rape. (If your boyfriend is pushing you to have sex when you don’t want to or in ways you don’t want to, that’s rape.) A relationship can be extremely chill, where no one walks on eggshells and no one yells. You deserve that kind of love."

It doesn’t sound like they’re feeling jealous or possessive; they are considering their emotional investment, and whether or not it would start to harm them if this relationship continues the way it is. It’s a need because they don’t want to leave the relationship, but they know that not being exclusive is causing her discomfort.

Desires and needs often cross over so there’s nothing wrong with it being both :) The only problem is when they don’t overlap, our desires can hurt us."
relationships,fo4gpsp,t3_g5gp9j,1587504105.0,"I’ve had communications issues in relationships over the last decade, and I’ve done lots of reading and therapy to try to figure it out.

Like other users have said, it’s up to him to sort it out. His communication troubles have nothing to do with you; you’ve done nothing wrong. But it’s amazing that you’re there to support him! I’m sure he appreciates your patience. Talking about the discrepancy is an awesome first step.

This could stem from a plethora of things. He might not feel listened to, he might feel like a burden, he might feel emasculated by his own feelings. Does he have any mental illnesses? I do, and communicating important things can feel like the weight of the world is on your shoulders, so it’s “easier” to bury it. (But, like you said, it gets to a boiling point.) Anger is known as a “secondary emotion”; usually there is already something emotional going on in someone’s head before another trigger (like finding out your SO hasn’t done the dishes yet) transforms it into anger.

I don’t think neither he nor you can figure this out without professional help. He clearly has something big that prevents him from being honest sometimes, and it’s going to take heavy lifting from him (and gentle support from you) to move it. Trying to figure it out on your own could be invasive, confusing, and frustrating for him. If you can’t afford therapy right now, there might be some local support groups or online forums where he can hear from other people with similar experiences.

All the best to you both!! xo"
philosophy,fo4edh3,t1_fo33s73,1587502907.0,"This entire thread is composed of folks singing praises for Gates, which entirely exemplifies your point of how he is the “good” billionaire. Whenever I have conversations about billionaires, Gates *always* comes up as some sort of “gotcha!” because he donates a part of his wealth.

No one can deny what he has contributed. The entire point is that, as the money is his, he can choose what causes are “worthy” of his donations. That’s a cruel kind of power to have.

I once read a story from the daughter of a shop owner. He had an extremely successful grocery store for decades, but their family remained in the lower-middle class. When she got older, she found out her father gave a lot of money to his employees, customers, and neighbours when they needed help. She said something along the lines of, “Giving people can never get rich in the first place.” It really struck a chord with me. (I’m sorry I can’t link the source, it was so long ago.)

My generation is hurting economically, and it is painful to see billionaires hoarding wealth instead of using part of it to help their communities prosper. There’s exorbitant wealth, and then there’s a hundred million dollars, and then there’s a billion dollars. One person doesn’t need all that, and seeing him continue to enjoy his wealth makes me think that he isn’t as altruistic as the media would have us believe."

Taking away the things you would do for an exclusive boyfriend, so you can save that emotional energy for the right person, would be an opportunity for him to see if he really did want exclusivity. “I miss those girlfriend behaviours and I’m willing to earn them” or “I don’t want her doing those things for someone else” might be what he needs to realize some of his feelings (if he isn’t in tune with them).

Or, he doesn’t want to pursue an exclusive relationship because he isn’t ready. That’s OK too. But like u/latenerd said, you’ll have room for someone else to step into your life that suits your needs :)"
relationships,fo48n5v,t3_g5gbqc,1587500083.0,"Life Pro Tip: When you want something from a relationship (friends/family/romantic partner), don’t worry about hurting their feelings. I used to walk on eggshells in case I was “asking for too much”; in the end, I was mostly hurting myself by bottling up my needs and making myself anxious.

When you’re ready to have this talk, I would open with the question, “How would you feel about being exclusive?” This way, he can tell you how he feels about committing to you before you confess your feelings. Then you can have an open discussion from there about where you both stand.

When I have an issue with a loved one, I like to be up-front with what I want and what I expect. “Hey, how do you feel about being exclusive? We hang out a lot, and I’m not interested in seeing anyone else. If you don’t want to be exclusive that’s okay, I still want to hang out with you, but could you tell me why?” Etc.

I want to add: It’s okay if you don’t want to be non-exclusive. Don’t think you need to agree to FWB as a reason to keep him in your life. I did this for a long time, and it ended up being a red flag that he wanted to have me around but not as a girlfriend. Make sure you look out for your own emotional health ❤️"

I’m so glad I took control of my settings so that when I do open the app to look at my subscriptions I don’t have to worry about my safety and privacy."
depression,fla3ln5,t1_fl9ks0m,1584975881.0,That’s awesome! Good for you :) How did you feel afterwards?
relationships,fl8upzs,t1_fl8u2yw,1584932791.0,"Thank you <3

I was briefly in a relationship in my teens where I was in a caretaker position, and it was awful. Not only because I am mentally ill myself, but also because feeling relied on was tolling.

You do deserve a partnership where you BOTH take care of each other *when you need it*. Unlearning past tendencies can be really hard, but I truly hope you achieve what you want to achieve! Whether that’s in partnerships or friendships or career or anything else. XOXOXO"

I went to Nova Scotia 7 years ago and I did a 3-hour whale-watching tour on the last day and saw NO whales. It was super disappointing. (I still want to go back, though. I think it was just poor weather.)

Thanks for the recommendation!"

However if anyone does have mental illness(es) and they choose to drink, self-awareness is necessary."

relationships,fl8nxo5,t1_fl8nfyu,1584928093.0,"Many people are. I wasn’t asking for advice, but there were plenty of comments asking about my mental state. Some of them were genuinely helpful, others were condescending.

(If I’m honest, after this many comments I had to go lie down and cuddle with him and think about whether either of us was acting abusively or childishly. I was starting to dissociate a little bit, so that’s a clue to take a break from reading and get in touch with reality.)"
