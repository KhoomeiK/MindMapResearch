antidepressants,f7qmuku,t3_dxgt27,1573966284.0,"I highly suggest trying SAM-e. It should counteract the fact her system is starving for some extra serotonin, and it has minimal side effects. Going on-and-off medication is not only counterproductive, it is urgently dangerous. If someone is experiencing genuine suicidal thoughts, they should go to the emergency room immediately."
lonely,f7oshmy,t3_dx70ur,1573933233.0,"Honestly, I already know this is by-the-book terrible advice, but try ecstasy just one time. Or shrooms or LSD once. It can be bad for someone with mental illness, but I had a schizophrenic friend who did shrooms one time, never again on purpose just to be safe, but it gave him optimism back. He saw the beauty in life for the first time, and he holds on to those memories. Life‚Äôs worth it, but sometimes it takes spiritual experiences to determine that for one‚Äôs self. Message me anytime you feel alone.. literally anytime. ‚Äúzornbd‚Äù on Instagram or just on here. I‚Äôll always respond, 100%, and if you live in my area I‚Äôm down to be your friend. You sound like a good, caring person. I believe you‚Äôll find friends and love and happiness. Love will lead the way. I believe in you."

OCD,f7ipf8u,t1_f7gn2lt,1573763385.0,"woah, that‚Äôs crazy you say that. I‚Äôm the same way. I write a lot of poetry and have similar things running through my mind all the time, for better or worse. At least we‚Äôre getting some benefit out of it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
OCD,f7gmh1a,t1_f7gltcf,1573708524.0,"Nice. With zero negative intent behind me saying this, it seems like they‚Äôre not working. I know that my life changed when I started doing my own research and actively telling my doctor what I needed to be healthy. But anyways, I started taking SAM-e a few months ago, and it gave me a lot of clarity to see through my OCD thought patterns. Maybe look into that. It can be taken alongside the drugs you‚Äôre taking, with minimal if any side effects."
OCD,f7gm3uh,t3_dvx4c6,1573708168.0,"I‚Äôd say at most, that‚Äôs mild sexual harassment. I think like 0.01% of the population would consider that an assault, assuming these were typical, everyday consensual hugs. However, I understand your distress. You must remember that the fact you‚Äôre so upset means you are inherently a good person. Good people and bad people both make mistakes, but good people try to not make the same mistakes. So you are therefore actively being a good person. Judging by your level of inner turmoil, your suicide would be the loss of a damn good person. Keep fighting. I believe in you."
OCD,f7glog9,t3_dvyej1,1573707746.0,"I was experiencing the same but went on a tiny dose of an antipsychotic (Rexulti), and it took so much of it away. I hope everything works out for you, fr. You‚Äôre a fighter."

antidepressants,f7glbg6,t3_dw1p3p,1573707395.0,"A great alternative for many would be SAM-e. I take 1600 mg and have never felt better. I tried like 5 SSRIs, and they either didn‚Äôt work, made things worse, and/or caused terrible side effects. But SAM-e is basically side effect free.. certainly not something that would cause weight gain. If anything, you might lose some after gaining motivation. It‚Äôs the thing that got me to start working out consistently for the first time in years. I highly recommend it as a first-line treatment for depression, or even as an adjunct treatment to go along with an SSRI, mood stabilizer, and/or antipsychotic."
antidepressants,f74s09p,t1_f74qc3f,1573407167.0,"wow, and I thought my SAM-e was costing me a lot. Bestvite has good deals, and a high quality product if you end up liking it. Although two friends only needed 400, it does take 1600 mg to make a significant difference for me. Anyway, good luck; hope everything works out well."
antidepressants,f74q29n,t3_dudz2j,1573406345.0,One thing you could do is try SAM-e first. You‚Äôd be able to order it online or go into Walmart or Vitamin Shoppe. https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/issa60.htm
antidepressants,f74pwow,t3_due1q8,1573406277.0,"I highly recommend SAM-e, if you currently have the financial resources. https://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/issa60.htm"
Drugs,f71184n,t3_dtxbza,1573334991.0,"SAM-e is significantly better, not least because of the lack of side effects. it‚Äôs worked side-effect free wonders for me and a couple friends. I highly recommend it ‚úä"
bipolar2,f6u8yur,t3_dt38xq,1573159660.0,"I‚Äôve had bad mood swings caused by antidepressants before. They passed once I went off the med. As far as gabapentin, I‚Äôve personally had great results with it. It‚Äôs basically a wonder med for me.. helps with anxiety, depression, and mood swings. It also does not make me sleepy, even at the rather large (600 mg x 3) dosage I‚Äôm on. Good luck! I hope the gabapentin makes you feel better."
antidepressants,f6kb0t3,t1_f6kaqc9,1572909114.0,"yeah, the only one I‚Äôve found to have consistent antidepressant effects w/o side effects. everyone‚Äôs different of course, but a couple friends had great results, too"
bipolar,f6k32q8,t3_drmx3s,1572904146.0,"I totally feel you.. always felt that way, though, for as long as I can remember, so I don‚Äôt know if it can necessarily be attributed to mania. I‚Äôve found that a lot of people have this innate belief, even friends that don‚Äôt display bipolar or psychotic symptoms. Idk, maybe it‚Äôs a narcissistic feature? But one that can take someone far, at least if he or she has the work ethic to achieve their perceived destiny. I personally have begun to fulfill what feels like my ‚Äúdestiny‚Äù once I found a career path I truly, intensely loved. I wouldn‚Äôt dismiss that feeling as ‚Äújust mania‚Äù. Maybe you are destined for greatness. I believe in that belief, if that makes sense. I believe in you. Good luck."
antidepressants,f6k0c4d,t3_dr68k6,1572902941.0,"I‚Äôve also had that problem for years. I‚Äôve tried a lot of stuff, but only two have helped: Tribulus Terrestris extract and Sildenafil (Viagra). Daily Tribulus supplementation seems to increase my libido within two weeks. I‚Äôve stopped it several times, subsequently had a drop in libido, and then started again with good results several times; so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs placebo (but if it is, fuck it, still works lol). I don‚Äôt think Tribulus helps with getting an erection necessarily, but it increases what I can only properly describe as my animal drive.... just the general desire for sex and relationships with women, in general. In emergencies, or (no shame) if you just always need it, Sildenafil/Viagra is unsurprisingly badass for inducing an erection. Good luck, I hope this helps."
antidepressants,f6jytlu,t3_drioc5,1572902286.0,"I started 10 a couple months ago and am now on 20. I‚Äôve tried like 5 SSRIs and Wellbutrin and had terrible side effects from them all, yet I‚Äôve barely experienced any from Trintellix. Interestingly, I also experienced headaches for like a week, but I‚Äôve actually been having far fewer headaches than normal (I‚Äôve always been someone who gets them regularly) since I went up to 20. So, as someone else mentioned, maybe an increase would help? Or at least some more time. But if they‚Äôre unbearable, I always recommend people talking to their doctors about side effects instead of toughing it out. Regardless, good luck! I hope your headaches pass and that the medication works out great for you, overall."
antidepressants,f6jxfuw,t3_drdaos,1572901682.0,"I recommend taking SAM-e after coming off antidepressants, (preferably a week or two after being off the medication because of a tiny risk of serotonin syndrome) at least for a month or two. It can mildly, naturally increase levels of neurotransmitters, including serotonin. It induces a peaceful feeling in many, one I‚Äôd term ‚Äúclarity‚Äù. Side effects are minimal; nonexistent for most. It can be obtained from Walmart, VitaminShoppe, and many websites (Bestvite has great deals and a high-quality product, in my experience). For many, SAM-e is even more effective than SSRIs/SNRIs/etc., so it‚Äôs the first-line medication treatment I recommend for depression (it‚Äôs great for joint pain, too... cured my carpal tunnel syndrome within two weeks). [NOTE: Those with bipolar disorder should be careful because there have been a few reports of mania possibly being induced from the use of SAM-e.... but then again, that risk exists for SSRIs, too.]"
