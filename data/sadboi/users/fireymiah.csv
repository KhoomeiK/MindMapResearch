AskReddit,evxg3j3,t1_evws4yb,1564891324.0,"It's like that in New Zealand too. When we did our driving tests a while back, only one center tested the stop sign because there weren't any stop signs near the other ones. It was either roundabouts, traffic lights or give way signs. Roundabouts were like 4 lanes too. 

Moved to the states, I see people stopped at yield signs and roundabouts and I start honking.."

A few weeks ago just randomly, I was googling suicide methods and wrote my suicide note. The next day, I felt fine. 

Some days, the hope voice is stronger but I think it's getting weaker and weaker compared to ""no one gives a damn about you, you'll always be alone. No one would even notice if you died. Just do it"". 

You give me hope though!! Thanks for sharing!"

wholesomememes,ev8vann,t1_ev8r319,1564292971.0,"Yup, Asian here!

Doctor straight up told my dad that I had anxiety and that was why I always felt like I couldn't breathe. Dad completely ignored it and said ""kids can't have anxiety, they have nothing to stress about. Must be something physically wrong with her"".

Never spoke of it again and to this day, I still suffer from anxiety. Also have depression and suicidal thoughts but he doesn't know because he'll just ignore it."
depression,ev8uq4j,t3_ciozwl,1564292304.0,"The other night, I was with my little sister at the beach in Honolulu, and it has a bunch of narrow walkways on the beach between the hotels. I so badly wanted to walk back to our hotel through the beach because it was pitch black and seemed dangerous. All because I wanted to feel something to feel alive. But for my sister's safety, we walked back on the lit streets. 

Now I'm home and feel depressed and dead on the inside. Maybe I should go walk in the dark in the mountains."
depression,eun18qd,t1_eulnty5,1563922952.0,It definitely sucks when you want to talk to someone but you feel like you're interrupting their lives! This is why I just end up not talking to anyone when I'm going through my depressive/suicidal episodes. People don't care about what I say anyway

Except I don't even feel alone, I just feel tired..
Everyone who knows me thinks I have this great life because I rarely show them my weaknesses, but sometimes it's so exhausting to fake it.

Sometimes I wonder what's the point? Family doesn't worry about me, I live alone, and my friends don't reach out anymore. I could be dead and no one would know for weeks or months."

lonely,erj5xyl,t3_c29f7x,1560916719.0,"I went through this with my ex.. Pretty similar progress. I'd go straight to bed and if he joined, I'd ask him to go to the living room because he'd just be on his phone. We both felt lonely even though we were in a relationship.

Looking back, it was because I was super depressed and was always too exhausted to keep trying in the relationship and communicate. 

I don't have anything to say that can help, but I hope you guys can work it out and neither of you stop trying."
