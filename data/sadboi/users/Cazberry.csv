If we pass another person she'll go off the sidewalk as far away from them as possible, but if we pass someone with another dog I have to pick her up to keep her from starting a fight.

You go ahead and make an insane driver angry, then. And since apparently the cops can't do their job right, there won't be anybody there to help you when that insane person pulls out a gun on you for not letting them in. Or you can butt out of other peoples' business and worry about your own safety and well-being. I don't care how you feel about law enforcement, and I don't care if you're the king of traffic engineers; it is *not* your job or your authority to try and teach someone a lesson on the road.

You'll get to your destination at the same rate and the douchebags will pick up the speeding tickets along the way.

Also, I've found it confuses people when I get over into the middle lane (when it's safe) to let them pass, and then get right back over as soon as they pass. Honestly if they're willing to go faster I can just trail behind them and match their speed, they obviously want to be in front anyway and my penis isn't small enough to have that problem. Here in Texas everyone goes about 90 on the freeway though, and if you're not you've got a big ol' truck tailgating you with blue LED lights."
