Thetruthishere,fqarc78,t3_ghsz8d,1589223944.0,"So winter of 2005/2006 I was a freshman in college and came home for winter break. While I was away my parents moved from the house I grew up in to a larger one a few miles away ... it’s an older house on the north side of Chicago and it has these eerie front windows that always remind me of Amnityville ... Anyways I get home and my parents are just heading out for my stepdads Christmas party so I would be home alone with the dogs for awhile ... no biggie I love being alone.

So here I am sitting on the couch watching tv and our dog Jake climbs up and on my lap (he was not a small dog by any means) and he was physically shaking ... as I’m petting him trying to calm him down I start talking out loud asking him what’s wrong and stuff - as I do I catch someone walking through the kitchen out of the corner of my eye ... but I’m positive I saw someone. I honestly didn’t think it was paranormal - I thought someone fucking broke in so I grabbed the fireplace poker and head into the kitchen .... there’s no one there ... so I go to the back door and was going to let a different dog out and go check the backyard but as I unlocked the door and pulled it towards me I saw the reflection of an older man standing behind me in the glass .... I spun around and no one was there but I was positive what I just saw so I grabbed the phone and called my mom - I didn’t want to freak her out but I didn’t want to be alone much longer so I started asking when they were coming home - my mom caught on something was wrong and kept asking until I told her .... she says “holy fuck you need to tell (stepdad) what you just told me” and hands him the phone .... I tell him and he starts laughing saying it’s Christmas not Halloween nice try thinking my mom and I collaborated a story together .... 

Our neighbor grew up in his house and told us when he was little an old man named Elmer lived in our house and told us a few things about him I haven’t been able to confirm but that there was a body in our basement (where my room was) at one point .... My mom moved out of state and asked me if I wanted to live in the house while it was on the market so I moved back from California to Chicago - turns out we would have to take a huge loss on the house to sell it so I’ve been living here for 4 years now .... in that time I’ve had a few weird things happen like hearing someone walk from one part of the house to the other when I’m the only one here .... or my stepdad called and said he’d be at the house in an hour or so I said alright I’ll see you then and hung up ... I walked into my bathroom (leaving my door open because it’s just me and my dogs right?) well I hear my stepdad yell “hello!” And I said “hey I’m in the bathroom I’ll be right up” and then went upstairs to ask why he said he was gonna be an hour .... but he wasn’t there and as I turned to go back downstairs there was a loud thump on the backdoor - I went over and saw I accidentally left one of my dogs out back and I think Elmer was letting me know! Ever since then I kinda think of him as more a Casper than anything ..."

chicago,fm42al8,t3_fsup5h,1585744652.0,"A few years back I lived in an apartment with a massive walk in closet (it was only slightly smaller than the bedroom) - as a joke I put a twin bed and a dresser in there and started calling it “my fort”. During this time, I was a regular at this restaurant down the street and got to know the waitstaff pretty well (I would sometimes go out for a drink with them after they closed) .... One of the waitresses started telling me how she was afraid to go home and it became alarmingly clear that she was in a really bad domestic violence situation..... Over the next few days we (myself, a few members of the wait staff, and the waitress) came up with an exit plan for her to get away from him - she ended up living in my closet for a few months while she saved up some money to move out of state back to her hometown ......... After she moved out of my closet one of the waiters called me and asked if I could help his sister out as well - so she ended up in my closet for a few weeks. (Lots of jokes about me keeping people in my closet were made)

Both of the girls ended up getting out of their situation and are now happily married to different men who seem like genuinely good men. In fact I was invited to the ones wedding not too long ago and she kept telling everyone that if it wasn’t for my closet she wouldn’t of been able to save money to get away from her abuser. 

That being said - you guys are awesome for doing what you are doing .... sometimes all someone needs is a helping hand to give them the means to escape a shitty situation.

Edit: WOW thanks for the awards guys! I had a friend a few years back that we’d compete to see who could do the most good deeds during a weekly time frame (the loser would have to buy the winner dinner and drinks on the weekend) ... and this story took place during that time frame so I can’t say my motives weren’t completely unselfish .... I did get a free dinner and drinks out of it!!
