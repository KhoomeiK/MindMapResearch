fatlogic,fpt69vp,t1_fpsgw14,1588885604.0,"wasn't there that study that said that long term restriction (3+ months in patients with anorexia) actually increased metabolism, thus the fictional ""set point"" was actually lower? I might just be talking out of my ass but I'll see if I can find that study, and my memory of the numbers might be wrong

Edit:

https://www.scienceofeds.org/2014/05/07/hypermetabolism-in-anorexia-nervosa/

There's a graphic near the start of this that says the hypermetabolism lasts for about 3-6 months and then normalizes, but there seems to be more easily accessible information saying the opposite. This may be a case of confirmation bias on my side, and I was not able to dig deep into actual published studies on this topic."
