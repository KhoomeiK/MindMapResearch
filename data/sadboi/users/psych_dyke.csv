bipolar2,fqo8ucu,t1_fqo68zg,1589509965.0,glad I was able to help and that you have a supportive partner! honestly these conditions and the interactions between them (e.g. not being able to take SSRI’s for the OCD because they cause bipolar mania) can be very tough. these subs are here for you so please always feel free to reach out!
bipolar2,fqo2jxv,t1_fqnmllh,1589506264.0,"not at all! I wouldn’t say that I’m experiencing any significant side effects right now really. I’m on a relatively small dose of lithium (150mg in the morning and 300mg at night) so I just need to make sure I’m drinking water and eating salty food but I don’t worry about lithium poisoning for example. The depakine can give me nystagmus in higher doses so I’m sticking to a lower dose (there were also problems with it affecting my period but now I skip them with the birth control anyway). It can also give hand tremors but the clondine helps with that. The clonidine is a beta blocker so I just need to make sure I drink water and eat salty food with it again to avoid dizziness (especially when standing up for example). The xanax can make me dissociate sometimes, so I take crumbs (quarter of a pill or so) of the lowest dose. Focalin can affect sleep and possibly induce mania/overstimulation so I take crumbs of it like the xanax and it fairly works!"

highdeas,fq1noij,t1_fpq8rta,1589047287.0,"honestly it doesn’t work every time and there are lots of factors like tolerance, the strain, the temp I vape at, how many puffs etc. I also take adhd meds and drink lots of caffeine so I guess that helps? you don’t wanna do it to the point where you’re high or where you even feel it, just wanna get a slight mood lift and then it’s almost like that feeling when you’re too high and every sound/touch/smell is amplified but now it’s just your brain focusing that attention to studying"
highdeas,fq1mjzw,t1_fppwh0s,1589046983.0,"same with it being my longest break from them too, and you’re right on with catching these thoughts and feeling like you need shrooms! the “when you get the message, hang up the phone” quote really applies to psychedelics cause shrooms want to show you how to grow yourself without depending on them :) I kinda feel the same rn tbh in that I don’t feel like I “need” to trip to help me, so I’m even more excited to just sit there and experience the pure love and joy in my next trip :)"

I’ll take a t-break soon and see what happens"
highdeas,fppoowf,t1_fppmlr0,1588806207.0,"to be fair, I only started recently and so haven’t gathered much insight about how it affects other aspects in my life besides academics and mood. I’m also going through some medicational changes that could be influencing my mood so it’s really just the academics that I can talk about. 

I use a dry herb vaporizer with dosing capsules. no more than 0.1-0.2g of weed in each cap. the temperature range also gives you control over the high (how high you wanna get and body vs mind high). I currently have a high tolerance and can still get baked when vaping a couple caps with higher temps, but when I stick to the lower temps I get a decent mood lift/slight buzz, reduced anxiety, and a general feeling of being calmer and more focused.  

lol I’d be happy to help you finish your weed. do you smoke while microdosing psychs? if so, is it shrooms or acid? when I’ve tried microdosing shrooms before I’d then get thought loops when I smoke which is weird cause I was only taking 0.05g and it isn’t a potent batch or anything."

Hi. I have late work from before March, multiple mental health conditions, and pretty much haven’t done any shit since quarantine started too. It sucks ass and I’m sorry you’re dealing with this. 
My professors have been fairly accommodating with a few slight exceptions. If yours turn out not to be as understanding, you can usually work it through with the DRC. My therapist also wrote me a letter that included how my lack of communication is due to my mental health and the pandemic impact instead of carelessness etc. Something similar from your doctor can help. 
Just remember that in the end you and your health come first. You have all the time ahead of you and school is only one part of your life. Take good care and stay hydrated! I’m here if you ever want to talk"

I told them to be friends before a romantic relationship “fully” developed between us (they’re in a polyamorous relationship and it wasn’t clear what are we to each other exactly but it was heading in that direction and we were comfortable with no label).  In other words, I meant “stay just friends”. Sorry if I’m coming off strong but I haven’t slept, English is my second language so it’s hard to put thoughts into words properly, and seeing an assumption that I’ll try to be friends with an ex after something was official and ended officially did hurt me because I’ve been there and know the pain. 

I’m in therapy twice a week, on a bunch of medications, doing my best with meditation/grounding/other exercises, and I’ve been by myself for a long, long time (sometimes going days without human contact even).
