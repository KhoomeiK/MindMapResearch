It does get boring here and there, that's actually why I'm playing SD. I think overall I prefer SD to TLD because you can actually make base rather than finding it. I've noticed that in TLD I would start a new game and just use the same bases and do the same things the same way I always did. I'm on autopilot, but in SD on my current save I have multiple bases and they both look vastly different.

Honestly, I'd give it a shot again. If you enjoy survival games then you'll enjoy it. They did also add a new map and other updates, which idk off hand."
