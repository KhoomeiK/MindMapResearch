He’s a tall, skinny white guy with a headlamp dressed in all black with a baseball cap.  He stops a few feet away from me and waves at me.  I wave back out of politeness, but he seemed off.  I started sprinting away from him, got 30 yards of distance, and looked behind myself to see how he reacted.  He started sprinting towards me so I immediately start booking it.  Then I look again and see him and a new guy running after me.  They yell for me to stop.  At this point, I am about 50 yards away.  I smile, because it’ll be a cold day in hell when you win a race against me after I get a head start that big.  I start sprinting towards the highway for a straight two minutes, stop to hyperventilate for a bit, look up to them being 130 yards away at this point.  They are still running towards me.  I then start running the wrong way on the highway, get to a traffic light, and cross the street.  I run across the street, keep running, and look to see both of them still at the beach seemingly arguing with each other.  I don’t wanna know what would happen if they caught up to me.  I gave them the slip I guess.
