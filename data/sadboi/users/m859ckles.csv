She had this big privacy fence in her backyard, and never really took her dog on a walk, so we hardly ever saw him, much less interacted with him. When this happened, we were sitting on our front porch and just ruffed at the dog a few times, ruffed at each other, and laughed. We didn’t get near them, didn’t interact with the dog or neighbor, we were just being kids and making “dog noises”. Our neighbor screamed and yelled at us for being disrespectful and harassing them, which seemed to stress the dog out much more than any of our ruffing did."

Colorguard,fn9a60t,t3_g0dvqp,1586765002.0,"Oh gosh it’s a massive commitment. During the season it’s like your social life gets put on pause because you never have time to do anything. In my guard, every day of the week we would practice 3:15 pm-8:30/9:00 with Wednesday’s off. Friday’s were football games so we didn’t get home til at least 11 pm. 

Saturday’s were always competition days. On Saturday we had to be at the school by 6 am and would often not get back home from the competition until between 12am-2am THE NEXT DAY. And then Sunday is spent sleeping all day and resting because your body is so sore from a nearly 24 hour competition. I wish I wish I was exaggerating some of these times, but it was such a big commitment in school. I wasn’t able to do anything else other than barely keep up with school work. Don’t let my guards practice hours scare you! Try talking to vets to get an idea of what to expect from your guard specifically. It seems like a lot of work (it is) but if your heart is in it it’s really really worth every second. Hope this helped!"

relationship_advice,flcj8jm,t3_fnzpz2,1585033003.0,"Understand that it probably bothers him 100x more than it bothers you. I have social anxiety and if I could flip a switch to turn it off, I would in a heartbeat, but it’s not that easy. Personally, I need to be really comfortable with a person before I feel like I can be myself around them. I’m not sure if that’s the case with your partner or not, but I’ve heard from others who have social anxiety that that’s the case for them. 

Group settings can be really hard for socially anxious people. You could support him just by being there for him in social situations. I know you may not want to be a crutch to him, but I’ve found having someone I know and trust in anxiety inducing situations helps me cope. I feel like I can be more myself and more open when someone I know is there. That leads to me getting to know new people, and building confidence in social situations. 

Try coaxing him into going out more. Start with small outings and work your way up to bigger groups as he gets more comfortable. Just be careful to not force him to go out. My ex used to force me to come with him to parties and group hangouts so I’d “get used to being around other people”. Obviously it made me horribly anxious because I didn’t want to be there, and I ended up having panic attacks every time. The intention was good, just bad execution. Give him time to decide wether or not to go out, let him start out on his own terms so he feels more comfortable."

AskReddit,fit1tcw,t3_f9kd1v,1582700895.0,"A little late so I doubt anyone will read this. I spent a good chunk of my childhood thinking I was going to die. I had my first panic attack at the age 8, and I remember it so vividly. My chest started hurting, I felt like I couldn’t breathe, and I had this overwhelming feeling that something bad was about to happen. I really thought that I was going to die in the middle of my 3rd grade classroom. After that, I started having panic attacks every day. As a kid, I had no idea what a panic attack, or even anxiety, was. I felt physical symptoms, so In my mind that meant I had a physical problem that was going to end in me dying young. Every morning I woke up, I was genuinely surprised. I went to bed every night crying, thinking it was my last night alive. I went on like that for about 5 years, before my parents finally put me in therapy and I realized I’m not dying, just have hella anxiety issues."

lexington,fgmqrg8,t3_ezdb20,1580930143.0,"Worked there about a year ago for five months. It’s alright. The training was super long and pretty boring. IIRC, the training is three weeks long, and you have to pass a test at the end. It’s pretty dull and a lot of people quit after the first week. 

They constantly change what they expect you to do without notice. One day we were told to tell customer: X, and the next day we were told to tell them Y. It could get pretty confusing sometimes, it felt like you never really know what they wanted from you. 

Customers can take surveys after your chats, and it’s a joke. They have options to pick if they were completely satisfied, somewhat satisfied, neutral, somewhat dissatisfied, and completely dissatisfied. Surveys are a very big deal working here. If you got a neutral or below, it dropped your satisfaction percentage drastically. If your satisfaction surveys fall below a certain percent, you run the risk of losing your job. Schedules are also given out based on your satisfaction survey. You “bid” for schedules based on how well you’ve been doing. If your surveys are bad, you’ll never get the schedule you want, as everyone else will have first pick over you. 

Customers also often times will give you bad surveys for things that are completely out of your control. One time I had someone give me a completely dissatisfied rating, because she was upset the Apple store near her didn’t have appointments for that day. You can try to dispute these ratings, but I promise you they will NEVER take a bad survey off your record, no matter he circumstances. 

The managers constantly ask everyone on their team (there’s multiple teams per shift) if they’re willing to work overtime. They always said it wasn’t mandatory, but they always put so much pressure on you when asking during the day. I ended up cutting a lot of lunches short and leaving late, just because my team manager made me feel guilty for saying no. 

I’m making it out to seem really negative, but there’s good things too! Everyone is super nice and willing to help you if you’re struggling. You never really feel like any trouble asking for advice or help. During your first 2 months on the floor, you’ll work very closely with your managers and supervisors. The first few weeks working here is rough while you get the hang of talking to customer and offering support, so that kind of help is awesome. Your managers will ease you in and help you get used to it. If you ever have chats that are particularly difficult, you can bring it up during your daily meeting, and they can walk you and your entire training class through it for future reference. The training and support you receive while starting is really helpful. 

Overall not the worst place to work, but not he best either. The pay is decent, the work is easy enough, and the environment and company culture are alright. While I was there you could listen to music and read books in between chats, and everyone was really nice. On the weekends it gets very busy (taking three chats at a time) so you have to be able to multi task very well. There’s a lot more that I could say about this place, so feel free to shoot me a message if you want to hear anything specific. Hope this helps!"

AskReddit,ffx8x54,t3_evnzey,1580320209.0,"Just because you can’t finish something 100%, or be perfect at it, means it’s not worth  doing. As a former gifted child  who now suffers multiple mental illnesses, this was hard for me to learn.  I figured if I wasn’t immediately good at something there was no use doing it.  When I started dealing with depression, I never wanted to clean because it was too big of a mess, and there was no way I could finish it all at once. It just seemed so overwhelming. I read somewhere that “anything worth doing is worth doing poorly, until you can do it better”. If you can’t clean your room fully, that’s fine! Take 15 mins and clean a surface or some clothes off the floor.  That essay feels too daunting? Try doing a quarter of it then give yourself a break.

Also depends what orders you’re taking. Once you’ve been dashing long enough you learn what orders pay off better than others.

AskReddit,ff47z4y,t3_ergjyj,1579557519.0,"Not retail but fast food. When I was 16 I worked at White Castle. I was always on drive thru because I was good at it and I generally enjoyed it. One day I was training someone new, and she was getting the hang of things pretty quickly. We suddenly got hit with a big rush. My trainee  said she felt confident enough to take the orders, while I dealt with payments and handing out orders. I was keeping an eye on her to also make sure all orders got rang up correctly. 

This lady pulls up to the window, I take her payment and double check her order before handing it out. I handed the order out the window and told her to have a nice day. I was in the process of pulling up the next persons order when I heard honking. I looked up and the woman was holding a slider and was fuming. I opened up the window and asked her if everything was ok. 

This lady went on a rampage about wanting no pickles and how we put them on to “spite her” I apologized and explained we were training someone new, and it was an honest mistake. I guess apologizing just pissed her off more, because she took the pickles from the burger and THREW THEM AT ME. She then started yelling about how we shouldn’t hire incompetent people, and how the new girl should be fired. I hadn’t even had a chance to offer to fix her order before she went on a pickle throwing tirade. 

That’s the closest I’ve ever come close to actually going off on a customer and possibly losing my job. She made the girl I was training cry, and had just thrown food at me. It took all the composure I could muster to just get the manager and walk away. My manager just fixed the sandwiches, handed them out and told her to never come back again. Thankfully never saw her again after that."

Right now I’m in therapy and starting meds so hopefully that helps. Moving back with my parents will give me time to do nothing but focus on getting myself healthy again. As bad as it may seem,things are at least kinda looking up haha. Thank you for your kind words :)"
AskReddit,f6sbvp9,t1_f6rj32b,1573131341.0,"Luckily for me most pill form birth controls I’ve used have worked well enough, some mild anxiety with them but that’s all. For now I’ve switched to those and honestly, I don’t think I’ll ever try anything else haha. 

I tried SSRIs for a while but they never seemed to help much.  After seeing a new therapist and psychiatrist they determined im bipolar, with the onset of symptoms being after I had the shot. Now I’m staring a new medication and I’m only taking time to work on myself. Hopefully that’ll put me on the right direction soon enough :)"
AskReddit,f6sb8gt,t1_f6rfjpu,1573130979.0,Thank you. I’m just trying to take every day at a time. I wish more than anything I had done more research before blindly agreeing to getting it. I’ve read so many stories of women struggling with it and yet the risk was brushed off to me. I definitely think that drs should emphasize the possibility of mental side effects as much as they do the physical ones.

AskReddit,f6r99kk,t1_f6r6vg1,1573097016.0,Haha thank you! Sometimes it just feels like I have to get everything done now. I just have to keep going one day at a time like you said. I’ll get where I’m going one of these days.

AskReddit,f6r10yq,t3_dsmwqk,1573091016.0,"Getting the depo-provera birth control shot. I got it when I was 17 to try and help with my endometriosis. It was kinda a “last resort” for me before my doctor would consider surgery.  The shot is basically giving your body  three months worth of hormones in one go. That goes about as well as you’d expect it to. I was told there was a very slight chance of feeling depressed or suicidal. So I got the shot and went on my way. 

I was in all AP classes at the time and was about to take my exams and getting ready to graduate. I had been accepted to my dream school, and had all expenses paid through many scholarships I had won. I was so excited for college and I couldn’t wait for my future. I was a first generation college student and my family was so beyond proud and excited for me as well. 

After having the shot for a month, I was suddenly dealing with crippling depression. I wasn’t showing up to classes, and when I did I had panic attacks for most of the time I was there. I would have debilitating anxiety just leaving the house and would lay in bed all day and cry instead of doing much. I would beg my mom in the mornings to let me stay home just one more day. She always caved and let me stay. My grades plummeted and truancy letters were stacking up at our door. My friends couldn’t even speak to me, I had become a shell of a person. 

I was planning on killing myself, which luckily was stopped by my mother. She found a few letters I had written and she took me to an inpatient clinic for an assessment. I was assessed and it was determined I stay inpatient because I had a plan and letters. I stayed for a while and then did intensive outpatient. I never did go back to school. I finished my classes out online and barley graduated. I ended up losing a few scholarships, got my entry to the honors college revoked, and could no longer afford to go (it was out of state). I felt like a massive disappointment to myself and my family. I was left with no will to live anymore. 

I wish I could say it got better. 3 years later and I’m  about to move in with my parents and probably get put inpatient again for my horrible mental health. I figured over time I would heal and get better, but it only seems to get worse. I can’t help but think if I hadn’t become so depressed from the depo shot, would I be like this today? Would I be getting ready to graduate with my peers? Would I be doing well in my classes? All I know is, I would give anything to go back in time and beg 17 year old me to not get that shot. 

Sorry for the long text block. Just had to get that off my chest."

AskReddit,f5z47wf,t3_dpmkwh,1572566697.0,I’m bipolar and I never want to pass it onto my children. It’s hell on earth some days and I couldn’t watch my own children suffer.
BipolarReddit,f5u5wbz,t1_f5tr47k,1572468883.0,"That’s kinda insightful. I’ve actually done all the things you’ve mentioned (minus physical fights cause I’m a wimp lol)  and always thought I was just an angry person. Rage definitely feels like a more accurate way to describe it than anger. I really feel like I can’t control myself when I’m in a rage.  

I have been hospitalized at one point for making  suicidal threats during one of these episodes, but I never thought to mention that to my therapist. I figured it was just my depression cashing me to be suicidal. Now that I see all the signs of (hypo?)mania and depression in myself I’ll be sure to bring that up."
BipolarReddit,f5styum,t1_f5ss9gi,1572443094.0,Thanks for the tips! I’ve kinda used the reframing tactic with my general anxiety and it helps. I never thought to try that when I’m nearing or in an outburst. I’ll try that out next time when I feel it coming on and see how I do. Thank you!
BipolarReddit,f5srq8a,t1_f5sq0uv,1572441389.0,I hope the medication will help. I’m going to start on that within the next month or so hopefully. It’s just so hard for me to let it go and not do anything. It just feels like I absolutely have to. What tricks do you use to stop yourself from acting on the urge to keep going?
BipolarReddit,f5srk71,t1_f5s6h85,1572441255.0,"I definitely get your first point. Makes total sense. It’s hard for me to tell when it’s gonna happen. It often feels like a switch just kinda goes off in my head and I’m suddenly in a state of pure anger and rage. I know when I’m in the middle of an emotional outburst, but it feels like at that point I’m powerless to do anything about it. I feel like I have to keep going on if that makes sense. It makes the humiliation afterwords feel even worse. I know what I’m doing yet I choose to continue."
AskReddit,f5pnj8r,t3_doo30p,1572363589.0,"Being bipolar. For my entire life I thought I just had depression, and when my psychiatrist diagnosed me with bipolar 2 I felt like I was actually crazy. Having to take medication for it made me super self conscious, because I was so scared of anyone knowing just how “out of my mind” I was. I couldn’t stand the thought of taking this stuff for the rest of my life. Thankfully with therapy and continuing the medication I understand just how badly I needed it. My life is much better now thanks to it, just took me a while to come to terms with it"

AmItheAsshole,f5oc2a6,t1_f5obe0k,1572314527.0,Exactly! I can’t understand why he felt the need to kick the dog poop at the homeowner who was rightly upset at his actions. That’s just immature and rude.
AmItheAsshole,f5obr0g,t1_f5obcxq,1572314329.0,"Can’t help that the bag fell, but a truly “superb” dog owner would carry more than one bag. I have one dog and I always carry multiples for this exact reason."
AmItheAsshole,f5ob6zx,t3_doj05y,1572313964.0,"YTA. I get that you struggle with self esteem, and how that comment would make you upset, but It sounds like you didn’t even let the guy say anything else before you started cursing at him and storming off. I doubt he said any of that with your self esteem issues in mind. 

I’ve also dealt with depression my entire life. An issue I’ve always had with being depressed is blaming myself for real problems. Depression can be cruel sometimes and can make you feel like you’re making your symptoms up, or that they’re not that bad. Your friend said he feels like he’s using his self esteem issues to make his life seem “worse”. That sounds exactly like he’s trying to play off his insecurities about himself as something he just needs to control. I hope you both get the help you need."

I was shocked he even came to complete the order. I certainly wouldn’t have. I gave him all the cash I had, it felt like the only thing I could do. I found out later that woman died in the hospital.
