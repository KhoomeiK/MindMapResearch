People in medieval times took dental hygiene pretty seriously, considering they thought diseases were transmitted through miasma--basically bad smells. Halitosis was thus assumed to be a danger. In fact, there's some evidence people thought leprosy was transmitted through bad breath specifically."

What's going on is, in part, the keys are throwing out multiple inputs when I only tap it once. That one has been mentioned and is easy to fix: unplug the underglow usb. But that means no underglow for me, and disconnecting the wrist rest and putting it back does nothing.

What makes this really confusing is that the support page on the website tells me to make sure underglow is working properly. Easy enough, right? Well apparently not, because the underglow is only working on the wrist rest, not the keyboard, and when the underglow usb is plugged in the entire lighting system lags, refreshing once every few seconds (on the spectrum wheel) and when I switch lighting profiles, it goes top to bottom in three steps, then again in another three to brighten the RGB, before it finally rests on the new lighting profile.

I can't find anyone else who mentions this problem and I have no clue how to fix it. It's pretty frustrating. Luckily enough, the underglow isn't necessary and I can unplug it, and everything else works fine. However, I would really like to have the underglow as it's part of why I bought the keyboard.

Thanks in advance for any help you can offer.

Edit: Fixed below, but for anyone who is wondering: I encountered this issue after unplugging my underglow usb to fit a controller in. It seems to occur every time I do this."
