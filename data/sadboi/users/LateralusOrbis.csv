In the end Blizzard is final say on what is canon. And like I said they fleshed everything out starting in the lead up to Diablo 3. That's when they said ""This is a character we will grow, let's make final decisions on him now that we are defining him more."".

I can understand liking the old spelling more. Lots of things to love and hold onto from D1 and D2. But if we are talking canon I think it's clear where we stand now, especially over the last 13 years or so since Sin War came out when it was set to Trag'Oul."

It's common that spellings of characters in games will sometimes change. The characters will grow or be more. In this case it was simply an item and a set name in Diablo 2. But when they actually flushed out the world and created the character it was from in earnest they changed it.

Granted I don't have anything to back this up but I know that blizzard changes name sometimes or slightly alters them to be more readable, plus it's a lot more believable that they just change the name when they truly defined the character and not that they had a typo and flubbed it up for the past 15 years."

That being said I think for what the team that did the artwork for Warcraft 3 did did a great job, obviously the in-game quality of the models is fantastic, things are pretty solid.

The issue is that they weren't managed properly by blizzard. either that or blizzard didn't care that the art style didn't match their own company.

If blizzard actually cared about the models being correct then you would have either seen the game delayed and then blaming the external company, or see the game delayed and blame their internal process for what led to those models.

Of course the models are only a small portion of the issues that Warcraft reforged has. You can't blame an external company for blizzard killing battlenet for Warcraft 3."

They are going to get negative publicity on any remasters until we get another remaster like starcraft, which fulfills everything and is absolutely solid.

Most importantly remember who bought out and invested into CCP. And remember what happened with the financials while back.

4kTV,fptpzt2,t1_fptmqsq,1588895946.0,"I wouldn't pay any attention first off to someone who's saying next gen console games won't take advantage of it. They aren't out yet, so that's 100% speculation. So here's my speculation: The jump from current-gen to next-gen is much higher than the PS3->PS4/X360->X1 jump. The tech will absolute be there at launch. Unlike how the current-gen's start, a lot of games were 900p. That's whats scaring people off from hoping that games will take more advantage of the tech.

It's speculation whether gaming companies will take advantage of the tech. But it's facts that the leap is larger this time and can meet the new features and capabilities Microsoft and Sony are touting.

My actual prediction is that cinematic games or certain indies will run at lower fps intentionally. The highest end games that aren't as well optimized will run at 60fps, but we'll see plenty of AAA at the highest FPS and utilize HDMI 2.1 to its fullest. And then most other games will stay at max capability of the hardware (1080 or 4k) always. My speculation is that these systems will end up being major 4k TV sellers for sure.

I think the only reason my personal speculation might not be the case I think is if not enough TV's get HDMI 2.1. Or there ends up being some unknown common issue. Otherwise if its widely available after a time, we'll be solid."

Usually I turn off anti-aliasing but leave the other polish on. 27'in 4k screen anti-aliasing isn't needed much.

I think a lot of people have a stigma about gaming in 4k, but more games can handle it than ppl think. Since the 10' series with pascal things have been a lot better. I got a 4k screen before this one back before getting the graphics amplifier and had a 970M. Definitely, definitely could not do what I wanted in 4k.

Bumble,foscohr,t1_foscn4j,1588028130.0,Oh my God this is amazing. Please go on. I even gave you an upvote. This is gold.
Bumble,fosb78q,t1_fos98lc,1588027323.0,The fact that you're not complaining about his post to implies that you are missing the big issue here. If you are reading what he said and you don't find it an issue then you're probably just like him and I'm not going to explain it to you or help you figure out why you shouldn't be defending this guy. Plain and simple the idiocy and hilarity of what he said is lost on you. So if you're talkin just like the guy then by all means continue defending him because I will get nothing but more laughs out of it. Which is why I follow this subreddit.

I'm saying expecting serious discussion here or treating this almost like a political for him isn't going to get you anywhere. I'm not saying you can't post or say what you want, I'm just saying expecting what you are expecting won't get you what you are looking for."
NotMyJob,foo9ujv,t1_foo9akw,1587935253.0,"Get out of your tunnel vision for a second dude. You're debating positions. I'm not. I'm saying we're not talking about siding with positions. If you have a position fine but this isn't the place for it. not that you can't talk about whatever but having a problem with other people in this Reddit is a bit silly.

This is pretty much for comedic relief. I don't have a position and have not stated one on this. Clearly, he has gone over your head. We are here to discuss the ethics of building the pole there or what people should do or what they could have done better.

Sure people will talk about that because they're curious.

But treating it seriously and expecting other people to take you seriously is pretty misinformed here.

Stop being a buzzkill and taking things seriously and just have fun with the fact that this is supposed to be funny. Or go away I don't care I'm done commenting, I'm going to go laugh some more."
