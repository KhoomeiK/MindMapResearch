AmItheAsshole,fok14t2,t1_fojnp6e,1587833419.0,"It’s not about seeing you as a mother, but you are in a close relationship with his father. Any child who gives an ounce of a fuck about their parents will eventually want to know what you’re “about.” Also children don’t just disappear when they grow up (if the relationship is good). Like other comments are saying, there really is no relationship without the kid there. The kid could literally disappear tomorrow, and he’d still *be there* in this guy’s life."
AmItheAsshole,fok0s4v,t1_fojm2uz,1587833223.0,"I’m sorry but this is just unrealistic. If you want a healthy/ happy relationship you will need to have some relationship with the son. Even if you stick with this plan, if the son can tell you’re being cold or keeping him at an arms length distance eventually they’re going to not like that (it’s already easy to hate a step parent — which you will naturally become if this relationship goes on long enough). It will cause added unnecessary tension in the relationship if you never make an effort to become “part of the family” (that includes the child). As someone who has step family in my life and has seen it in other people’s lives, you can’t just be dad’s girlfriend forever (even if that’s legally all you are), sooner or later people will expect you to be more present."

I get wanting to post pictures with your child but you two need to find a compromise here(maybe no public photos but you can send photos to friends/family). Also the photos being online doesn’t really add to the memory. If have the photos, you have the photos. I’m also more on the wife’s side because what she’s talking about is real and is not unreasonable. Even if you can’t control what people will do, it’s understandable that she doesn’t want photos of your child on some pervy website (or worse if a predator tried to contact her somehow). In this digital age, it’s important to be aware of how much you’re projecting out there cuz it’s hard to take it back."

I am not trying to be a psychologist here but everything you said screams he is trying to keep you an arms length distance. Possibly even more cuz you sound controlling and a lil clingy. Calling his girlfriend, who you haven’t met, an instant bitch just because she MIGHT be uncomfortable with her boyfriend still talking to his ex wife for no reason.

AmItheAsshole,fnajle3,t3_g0hrl6,1586798631.0,"YTA, I’m sorry but three years, THREE YEARS and you didn’t tell him that you only have one breast. If I was missing a leg and for three years never told my partner they would be fully in their right to think I was catfishing them. Some may say this is vain or whatever but you were actively lying about a very noticeable physical part of you. If you had alopecia, at some point you need to give up the ghost and confess to the wig. You didn’t even warn him before you got naked? What planet are you on?"

unpopularopinion,fn3no9m,t3_fz33c7,1586624351.0,"Every African american, racial, or sexual orientation club I have ever seen welcomes people of all races and orientations. The club is just focused on the culture and issues of that particular group. While that may seem silly and archaic to you, as long as there are issues for particular groups I think they have a right and good reason to focus on what’s going on with them. Hogwarts club is great but it’s likely not going to address gender/race discrimination which still happens."

AmItheAsshole,fm83w7p,t3_ftizt3,1585842326.0,"I’m not gonna judge you for not liking the look NAH, but as someone who has had a buzzcut for over 4 years (since high school )it really is as inconsequential as she’s making it out to be. Nothing really changes except maybe the groups that are attracted to you, but there’s no reflection on friends and family(I honestly don’t know what you’re worried will happen. Is it bullying idk?). It’s just a haircut like any other, it’s not that big a deal."
AmItheAsshole,fm82129,t3_ftmui5,1585841302.0,"YTA, I’m guessing you both know your parents, so when your sister said the parents would absolutely not let her abort, I believe her. I think she is young but this is her life and body on the line right now. I think you should do it."

She was being irresponsible and too “soft” for taking off the cone absolutely, but based on the post it sounds like you really raged out on her (which isn’t healthy or appropriate for a situation this small). There were several gradients of talking you could’ve gone before screaming."
unpopularopinion,fm7zsr9,t3_ftlccc,1585840064.0,"I mean I get what this post is saying. We all control how we react to things but some “offensive “ words and actions are allowed to be reacted to. What I’m saying is why do offended people per say have to always move on, is there never any fault on an offensive person ever. If I go into work and start talking about my coworkers tits, don’t I deserve to be reprimanded somehow (I’m being unprofessional and rude)? If I go to a concert and get into some racist speech (pick any group/ any slurs) I don’t think anyone would be in the wrong for booing me. If I say something mean or rude on the internet, people are allowed to tell me I’m being a dick."
AmItheAsshole,fm7yog2,t3_ftd115,1585839427.0,"I don’t think you’re a bad person her so NTA, but if This is currently going on in real time I want you to be prepared for the backlash you might face. Some people are suggesting you evict them sooner (since who has any time to move with a newborn as well) which is true but also may make you look worse. If this is in current time, then you’ll be labeled as the person who kicked out a pregnant, disabled woman, during an especially *rough* time. So if you can handle how you may possibly look, then go forward. I still don’t think you should have to care for essentially 3 people."

unpopularopinion,flzl8r6,t1_flzkj7w,1585626425.0,All I’m saying that a lot of those people you here complaining may be pretty grateful for the cash (lots are still working paycheck to paycheck as well) but there’s a lot to be worried about as well. Even though some may be working those jobs are not necessarily secure or even worth it (in the long run).
unpopularopinion,flzitc9,t3_fs4iup,1585624702.0,"There’s nothing wrong with people wanting more money (it never hurts to ask) that’s literally how any advancements in work conditions get done, someone has to complain. Especially in a time like this, this isn’t just a regular recession, there’s a contagious virus killing people. With that added risk being in close proximity to people, I think it’s reasonable to want some extra change in your pocket. The last thing I want to raise is maybe consider the kinds of companies that are staying open right now. Some are truly essential, some are greedy corporations scrambling to not go bankrupt. Other places are abusing their employees and overworking them. Call me crazy but I don’t think people should have to have their health or sanity destroyed over $10.50 an hour."
