mentalillness,fqmnhaj,t3_gjayaj,1589480378.0,"I feel this. After therapy I mended a lot of relationships as well. Allow me to tell you what I did. 

I took a long long look at what both parties did. I forgave myself after a long reflection on myself. Don't excuse yourself because of bipolar, you gotta forgive yourself but treat it like a growing experience and not a symptom. Something you can control with enough time. 

Then I apologized to people I thought deserved my apology. People who will understand that I've changed and am changing for the better all the time. People who won't take advantage of me at my weakest. 

They won't all want you back, but the ones that do make sure they don't regret it. This is a second chance deal so if you catch yourself acting with emotions attempt to bring yourself out. Itll be tough but after a while you'll be able to become self aware little by little. 

I hope this helped. Good luck out there!!!"

I have the same thing. I rock back and forth while listening to music and visualize a different life for myself. 

I'm an aspiring author and I use it my advantage. I also use law of attraction, scripting, and intention speech with this for visualizing.

For some people it's a symptom. I've had it since my I was 3 being my earliest memory of thinking of things while listening to Evanescence on my mom's MP3 player. 

Do some research on maladaptive daydreaming and see if you can relate. For me, it dosen't affect my life. Others have a bit more trouble drawing the line between reality and fantasy. 

If you need help, I'd go to a general psychologist first. As this isn't well known yet. And it certainly doesn't have any treatments as its seen as a symptom. Of course, research first.

I see it as a gift, but some have a lot of trouble living with it.

AskReddit,f3o3ju3,t3_dhfcve,1571007520.0,"All of my friends invited me to a party at our ""ring leader's"" house. They stole hundreds of dollars of items from Walmart. I was too anxious to ask why there were no seatbelts in her dad's car. We get to her house and I tried to text my sister because I was tired of their accusations and making fun of me. She saw them and decided I couldn't have my phone. It was the second day of my medicine and I was feeling all the side effects. They got drunk, called me ugly, made out, and then one of the girls threw up and as i was trying to help her the ring leader decided to accuse me. Accuse me of lying about everything. Lying about my parents issues, my sisters issues, my brothers issuess, going to a psychiatrist and taking medicine, and that my dad wouldn't let me go if it was raining. 

Then I pretended to be asleep and they talked about me for 4 hours up until 7 in the morning, it was 3 when the accusations occurred. I couldn't defend myself because she wouldnt stop yelling at me and was only yelling louder because I was ""making my self shake"". She threatened to punch me in the face and even said when she thought I was asleep that they could ""just kill"" me because ""no one loves"" me anyway. There were six loaded guns in the garage. They called me a goblin with autism and said that they hoped I would kill myself after this. They talked about how the lake was deep enough to throw me in. They said they should just leave me in here alone and go have fun else where. 

Then my mom and dad finally came and my mom saw the shot glasses they stole. I left immediately and my parents said they felt like something was wrong so they brought my dog Rico. I burst into tears and told them everything, my dad called the school and my psychiatrist to get me off the last 3 days of school before Christmas break. That Christmas was terrible. I got what I wanted, but I had planned to play super mario with them when they were gonna come over for my birthday so I asked for 3 controllers for the game cube. I asked for a ukulele because we were going to be a band. I asked for a camera to take pictures and a scrapbook to keep them In. All I had was 3 controllers i would never use, a ukulele I had no one to play with, and a camera and scrapbook that remains untouched. It was lonely and terrible. 

Yet I got through it. I came back to them for a while, even considered going to another party. I didn't and know they are out of my life. I refuse to be mean to them but I'm not in their group chat anymore and I muted them all on instagram. I dont see what they're doing and i don't need to know regardless. I know who my real friends are. 

Also, after the party I sent them pictures of my medicine and of my card for my psychiatrist. They had no argument left. They still try to talk to me, but I'm not there anymore. I don't need them. I've reconnected with people I broke off with because of them and I'm a lot better being treated for something i know I have. I am working to be an author so that's cool too.

I have better friends, I have better judgment and I'm happier without them. I haven't felt truly happy in a long time. I am writing, playing ukulele, painting, and working on myself as a whole. It helped me to be a better person entirely. I hope they grow up and realize that no one believe them. The school knows what happened by my parents and they believe it because of how you all decided to act. 

If anyone from the group is reading this, I hope you have your own reflection period and stop twisting things around to better suit your constant victim status."

I will say after the relief that all I had was celiac disease and I started gaining weight, my mom told me something that made me feel much more grateful for my life in its entirety. She told me multiple times through out the years they wanted to help me because I was too skinny. I was underweight and extremely tall for my age. She said that they didn't have enough money to go to the clinic for anything and my parents talked a lot about if I was going to die or not. And what to do if that happened.
Hearing that really changed my perspective. The feeling that if it had been anything like cancer I probably wouldn't be writing this right now. It made me realize what I truly wanted to do in my life. I want to help anyone I can going through mental or physical issues. I don't want any other family to have to watch their child die hopelessly. I have big dreams and I know what I'm destined to do in life. 

On a less sad note, I've found happiness in family. I'm online schooled now, so I don't have many people outside my household to talk to. I've cut out any and all relationships that tear me down and I feel much better about myself. 
I started pointing out what I like about myself and not my flaws, and I've learned to accept myself for who I am. A lot of self reflection and being gentle with myself. I would recommend facing all your guilt, shame, and mistakes and accepting that those events happen but they're in the past. Mistakes happen but the shame and embarrassment is what's holding you back. 

I've also focused on my hobbies and planned out my goals in life. I know what I want to do and what I need to do. Never question your fate. Fate is changeable. You make your own luck. I know what college I want to go to, I know that I want to major in psychology. I want to open my own psychologist office specifically aimed at low income families and students who have terrible or no insurance at all. I know I want to write and have a hand in the happiness of another's childhood. I know I want to help out community wise, I want to help the environment, and I want to have enough money to donate to charities and adopt and foster children. I want to be a mother at some point in my life and I want to be known and be an inspiring role model. 

The last thing is kind of cheesy but it's really helped me. Whenever something makes me happy, I write it down. I've found that I write more and more as the weeks go on. I believe this would be a type of manifestation. I don't know what it is, but it works so I don't care.
