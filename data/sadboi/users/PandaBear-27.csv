Compared to non-CBD driving at least for me. My mind could drift while I was doing the same route day in, day out and worrying about the day ahead, work, whether I'd be late etc I'd get agitated behind the wheel about slow people and idiots...now, I don't give as much of a shit! :')"

IF!!!...IF u legit have this going on then you've been honey trapped and you need to figure out whether you can trust her because she gave you lies about the BC and now whaddya-know--- no sex and she's pregnant, every two weeks or so when she's maybe been ovulating and suckered you into having this baby..

It can make it feel like a heart attack and you can experience very sharp pains when you breathe in but breathing out doesn't hurt so much/at all.

Perhaps worth checking to see if that could be a cause?"

I have just suffered a bad bout requiring steroid creams and was wrongly diagnosed an eczema infection that was actually fungal all across my hands. It's healing so well with Daktacort but I am definitely gonna try this stuff to see did it helps replenish what my skin is lacking biologically."
eczema,eux9pwj,t1_eux334c,1564084965.0,"Can confirm, although it hasn't stopped my itchiness but I am alot more relaxed in myself and it kind of shuts off your subconscious over-thinking anxiety ridden inner voice for a few hours - it's bliss.

You can get gummies (CBD bears) or oil, vape liquid and!... you can even get creams with CBD/low THC but I haven't tried that yet.

This hot weather got mine all red, dry, cracked and breaking down in tears because it's so goddamn depressing being hot and sweaty but embarassed of the skin on your body when it flares so you keep it covered. :( Tough times ahead.... X"

Being able to sleep solid without being disturbed by dry, cracked, itchy skin that won't let up.

Sweating in hot weather or at the gym without it stinging every part of your body that is dry or broken.

Being told that I should be mindful, to drink more water and moisturise 30 times a day to relieve the continuous heart-breaking cycle of living with a condition that I was born with and that ""eating right"" will somehow heal me.

Fuck I hate my skin!!!!!"
