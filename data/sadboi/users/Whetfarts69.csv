Gossip is human - doesn't mean it's good. Lot of 'natural' human behavior is bad. It's a means to avoid confrontation (or coincidentally when someone is too lazy to find out the truth themselves).

It's reductionist and disingenuous to point out ""tribalism"" when the MAGA fucks literally created their own tribe with a deity at the center.  It's not tribalism calling that nonsense out and opposing it carte blanche. The MAGA fucks want to normalize their fuckery and tribalism as a new side from which a ""middle"" can be found and this is unacceptable. This ""middle"" is a push of the Overton Window and tacit support of the corrupt system that allowed Trump. If we're talking about some individual *points* being correct that MAGA fucks happen to support, sure there is sometimes middle ground; but it should be clear every time you aren't in their tribe.

This wasn't the Berni-Bros versus Trumpettes here - a situation in which there would truly be 2 dumb tribes against one another. Trump's COVID-19 handling has been abysmal, it's cost thousands of lives, and needs to be mentioned every public chance that exists. He's tried to blame China for things the USA could have done better (though they have a lot to answer and pay for), insists on calling it the ""Chinese"" virus, when Asian-Americans are legitimately being victimized and he's basically egging it on. Even if we concede this reporter for being baiting, it's a drop in the bleach bucket of all the times Trump has harassed, dismissed, or lied about the media. This is being used as a ""see? This reporter is being dumb and is representative of all media criticizing Trump about COVID-19.""

In high school for over a year, I could barely eat nor sleep. Felt like I had adrenaline coursing through me all day every day. It's ""normal"" for anxiety though: it's our flight/fight system working too long and in overdrive. Our bodies aren't concerned with eating/digesting when there is an immediate perceived threat and our sympathetic nervous system overrides the parasympathetic. Even still when I go through a rough ""spell"" of anxiety, I find my appetite suppressed for days. Ironically, I'd be even more worried because I wasn't eating!

Obviously addressing the underlying cause for anxiety is number 1 task (easier said than done), but in the meantime, protein/meal-replacement drinks can be your savior for calories. Knowing you're still getting decent nutrition can help prevent or even can curb anxiety. One less thing to worry about and nutrition is essential for optimal brain health and mood."
