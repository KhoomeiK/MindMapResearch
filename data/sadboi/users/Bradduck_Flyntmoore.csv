AskReddit,fhdu6vg,t3_f2mm8u,1581501851.0,"From the phrasing, I think it's safe to assume you're asking about attractiveness regarding appearance. That being the case, unattractive would include poor hygiene (if you can smell you, so can everyone else), clothes which have obviously not been laundered recently (wrinkled is usually whatevs, but soiled or smelly is a no go), acne (it's shitty, but acne is universally disdained), closed off posture (body language often communicates how we feel subconsciously), poor/no grooming habits (creates appearance of apathy). Essentially, someone who looks like they can't take care of their self is unattractive.

If none of the above signs exist, someone is likely unattractive due to their personality. Unfortunately, personalities are too complex to dissect on an askreddit post (at least on mobile, as I am now), but generally people take issue with dishonesty, constant negativity, overconfidence, pity-partying, and bullying. Destructive behavior is also a fairly decent indicator, in my experience, that someone feels unattractive.

I want to add, attractiveness is super weird. Like, insanely weird and nonsensical. Chemistry exists and affects us all. If you can think of a way to be/look/act/dress/sound/or whatever, someone, somewhere, will find it attractive. That being said, avoiding the aforementioned behaviours, coupled with a dash or so of outgoing, will surely reduce the chances of someone being generally unattractive."

Ex: in the USA last year, the median net worth was a bit below $100k. Under the new law, possessing assets in excess of $10mil would result in a redistribution of those assets (reducing the perpetrator to the median).

Wealth hording should be a crime, and it should be punished. There is absolutely zero reason why any person should be allowed to possess dozens (or more) of lifetimes worth of assets.
