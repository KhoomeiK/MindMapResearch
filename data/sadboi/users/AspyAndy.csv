sv650,fqwbcf3,t3_gl8u30,1589698492.0,"Cas-v86 is pretty well spot on and has covered the majority of what I would have said and for the same reasons I would have said.  


A couple of things I'll address.  
Keep it in your own lane please. there's no need to be short cutting onto the wrong side of the road to straighten any corners on the street.

Your gear changes. You're doing a lot of unnecessary gear changes that will be upsetting the handling of the bike. You've got one of the fattest torque bands available and a lot of revs to use that, if you've got a choice between leaving it in 3rd of shifting back to 2nd and being at like 8000rpm, leave it in 3rd, It'll not only be smoother but quicker as you still have ladles of torque gravy to pour over your hot potatoes.  


Your corner planning needs a lot of attention. I'm seeing a lot of input updates in corners where you seem to be attacking  and sometimes actually over steering and having to back off the input, straighten up and have another dig effectively turning some long turns into 2 turns in effect. Plan your turns ahead, where you're going to start, where you're going to finish and the arc you plan to take through the corner. When you do this you can ride through the corner in a beautiful continuous smooth motion rather than a whole bunch of jerky ones. It also keeps you a lot safer on the street.  


Work on riding more fluid. Chose your nice flowing road, pick one gear and ride that road in a smooth flow without changing gears or using brakes. This is an exercise in learning to be smooth and corner planning. Rolling on, rolling off to slow down, rolling back on a touch to maintain your speed, tipping into a corner, rolling on when you can see your exit and you know you have room to before rolling off again for the next corner. That kind of thing.  


And forget dragging knee. Yeah looks cool but what do you hope to achieve ?"

Back when SYSK was on a different network and the ad's were done by Chuck and Josh they were so much more palatable, so much so that they actually encouraged me to explore other podcasts such as ""The Control Group"" and ""Atlanta Monster""  


The current run of ads and the level invasiveness leave me wanting to turn the freaking podcast off completely which is really very disappointing.

The very worst part is the I heart radio ads are taking me out of the listening zone.

Here in Australia the public can report loud exhausts and after 2 complaints you get an EPA notice to have the noise levels tested. Police are all too happy to hand out defect notices for anything with a non-standard exhaust as well usually to deter you from riding in popular areas.

I've had 3 bikes in the last year all with standard exhausts and it's been lovely, just simply being left alone. I can ride on a weekend on the most busy and popular roads and unless I'm doing something wrong the cops will always have bigger fish to fry than me on a standard bike.

So. Your unpopular opinion I believe may not actually be that unpopular.

I still believe everyone should have the freedom to choose whether they want their motorcycle to be quiet or loud and don't get me wrong, i love the sound of loud sweet sounding bike with a full race system. But that's better enjoyed at the track. 
I'm all for an aftermarket exhaust on bikes, many dramatically improve the looks and sometimes performance and can be done without being totally obnoxious."

The impotant thing is that you take something away from it. But don't let it be a reason for you to tense up and go full blown PTSD in the moment when something isn't right in future.The best advice I can offer to anyone is sometime during your riding career you should try spend a bit of time off road on some nasty surfaces. That really teaches you to ride and those skills transfer over to road riding in adverse conditions really well. Learning to dial out survial reactions that cause you to crash is the ultimate goal. I mean a huge plus is you end up having a lot of fun as well as learning something you can use in the real world!

Having said that. I'm just going to straight up say it. Sometimes your number comes up and you're just going down because there's a big fat oil patch, gravel patch or something that is totally beyond your ability to compensate for even see at times that will cause you to come unstuck.\*knock on wood\*It's been about 14 years for me since my last big oopsie. I've crashed at the track when another rider hit me, i've had a few silly falls in my former professional riding role where I'd go down, make a mess, look around \*did anyone see that ?\* then laugh, clean up and get back on my way and a couple of other mishaps involving heavy bikes on hills, loose surfaces and generally just not being in a situation that is conductive to keeping a heavy machine upright when the odds are stacked against you.

I've also had a few situations where I've had some fairly crappy situation come at me where if I'd just been going a bit slower i'd have never encountered any problem at all, in those situations which have been high speed loss of grip scenarios, each time i've managed to stay relaxed and composed enough to ride out of the slides and general nastiness. I'm going to say that's probably 50/50 luck and experience because there was very little margin for error where if i'd run out of asphalt I'd be one with the trees.

The only thing I can add here are some things that are not your friends in the motrocycling world.

Fresh tyres before being scrubbed in.  
Rainbow Roads (oil slicks)  
Painted lines  
Gravel  
A poorly maintained motorcycle  
Inattentive drivers at cross roads  
Angry drivers looking for vengence  
Your own complacency

If you have any rider training facilities within reach please reach out and use them. You'll love the experience, it's fun and you'll be a much better ride for taking the time.  


I've ridden pretty much everything you could imagine. My first real road bike was an 32hp 125cc sports bike.
