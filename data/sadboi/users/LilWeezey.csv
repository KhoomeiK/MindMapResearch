I simply am wondering how people can think that humans are better than animals. What reasoning exactly? 

Because you have complex thought? So do other animals. Dolphins are highly intelligent and apes, well seeing as we come from them they are also ridiculously smart. Animals are capable of emotions, they've been shown to mourn a loss.

Granted yes, animals are capable of great evils just like we are. That doesn't make them less than us. Their lives are just as worthwhile as ours.

I would absolutely save my dog before saving someone else (if they were an abled bodied adult anyways). Unless its some horrible circumstance you should be more than able to save yourself.
