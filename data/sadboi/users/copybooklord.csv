Sunlight (UV) was used to accelerate recovery during the Spanish flu.

EVERYONE and I mean EVERYONE has had a bad idea in their lifetime.  Many have vocalized it.  I think Trump’s GOOD ideas far outweigh the bad; pre-virus, his decisions paved the way for the best economy in history.  Without bad ideas we would have no good ideas.  Worst comes to worst, his experts tell him it wouldn’t work, and he leaves it at that.

He’s not a doctor; he’s not an expert.  He’s not supposed to be.  Importantly, he’s not a politician/actor whose lines are filtered through advisors and focus groups; he’s a regular guy who has made mistakes, but overall has been very good for the country.  They hate him because he wasn’t the anointed Establishment heir.  He is the product of the working man’s revolution.
