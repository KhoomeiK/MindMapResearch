BPD,fnzsjla,t3_g4tzqp,1587400001.0,Do you have any close friends or family you can spend a week with? Did you live with him?
BPD,fnzq7j5,t3_g4uipi,1587398801.0,You are validated and that‚Äôs completely normal to feel all of those emotions in a break up. Break ups for people with BPD are like taking our physical heart out of our chest and squishing it. It‚Äôs complicated and probably a little gross how much I am personally also replace scenarios in my head. I also I‚Äôm going through a break up right now and to be honest it sucks. Just know I‚Äôm always here and you could message me if you want to chat more. There‚Äôs a community that supports you here.
BPD,fnuna9i,t3_g3pzze,1587266199.0,I am appalled. I am a 22 year old female. Fuck that. Fuck that. You have some of the most loving and supportive community on your side. You. Are. Not. Alone.
BPD,fnhblbo,t3_g195pm,1586959231.0,"Same! I have read parts of the body keeps score. But for BPD, I just have not found a book that does it well."
BPD,fnhbi61,t1_fnenmr8,1586959178.0,Thank you!
BPD,fnhb9ts,t3_g195pm,1586959044.0,"You know, book wise, I have gone through so many... and I honestly haven‚Äôt found a book yet, that I am absolutely thrilled about. 

I can tell you, that I am not a huge fan of a-lot of older print material because anything 5 years or older is so outdated that it is hard to connect with. 

So much of the old material is just doctors and therapists alike complaining and not knowing how to treat BPD. Especially because YOU CAN go into remission and recover from it, so much of the older material drives me wild that it does not acknowledge this huge fact. How about you? Are you finding the audiobooks helpful? Any podcasts you are listening to?"
BPD,fnh9l74,t1_fng4smt,1586958043.0,"I found a copy of it online and it isn‚Äôt the worst thing so far! Some of it is a bit outdated, but that‚Äôs okay! I don‚Äôt think you sound like a jerk either, there‚Äôs not a ton of information out there about it."
BPD,fnh9hfs,t1_fng3u2w,1586957978.0,"Thank you, I appreciate it so I am ordering recommendations now. Did you have any materials that helped you with the DBT learning?

BPD,fn7ka0h,t1_fn6hepx,1586722015.0,I feel like this is so normal and totally relatable!
BPD,fn7k305,t3_fyhebn,1586721902.0,"ü•∫... wow the support on this reddit is awesome. Reading through all those questions really is helping me reflect. I am not 100% sure I will get one for awhile, but basically, I want to get my own mental health in check...

Something I struggle with is I see all of these people randomly getting animals during this quartine because they have time to take care of them and I guess... that is particularly true.. but also, I am so unsure about my next moves and where the job search will lead me I think overall. You are right. A dog is a large responsibility and I am not sure as of now I want to handle that, but I have always been someone that thrives in diversity so I am thinking maybe I should? 

Idk, I am not sure, but overall I am going to sit down and reflect more on those questions you sent me. It means a-lot

Thank you so much for the response and I will keep this reddit page updated. Stay healthy!"

THANK YOU! Thank you for your input. It really means a-lot. Have a wonderful rest of your day!"
BPD,fn7j9gr,t1_fn2w7zy,1586721436.0,Thank you! Yes! I am going to take some advice and try fostering one. :) thank you for the positive advice that gives me hope.
BPD,fmzzm48,t1_fmzxo4d,1586532693.0,"No that‚Äôs such a good idea! 

Thank you for sharing, I think with everything going on with Covid it is more tempting now more than every to get a dog, but I also want to think about long-term after this is over. 

I really appreciate your response! And will take that seriously into consideration."
BPD,fmnjk6s,t1_fmmud8y,1586227542.0,"You are amazing. Thank you for this. ü•∫üôáüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è... honestly in tears just by your comment and I am going to watch your video now. Everything is new. But for the first time, I am not in denial and I am learning how to accept myself in this world of bpd and hopefully someday get into remission. Thank you so much for your comment, and stay healthy!"
BPD,fmmdhyd,t1_fmm3ayl,1586203305.0,"Wow‚Äî- ü•∫... this makes me feel so much less alone. It is a scary time for the world right now and yeah, I will try out some of the rescources. I was in straight-up denail for so long, it‚Äôs interesting how you just understand and know what a BPD person needs. Thank you for meantioning that I don‚Äôt need to tell people. It‚Äôs hard to explain. I come off as a normal college sorority girl, I am involved in a ton of things, I cared about school. But as the years progressed I was able to give less and less of myself to people and things that I loved because there was something bigger (BPD) that was meddling in my life. I didn‚Äôt drop out of college, but I definitely have considered it so many times because of my lack of emotional regulation. It‚Äôs helpful knowing there‚Äôs a community and people out there like me.ü•∫‚ô•Ô∏è

Thank you again! Stay healthy!"
BPD,fmmclu3,t1_fmm3ua8,1586202861.0,"Thank you! Classes are all online now, so It‚Äôs definitely hard for someone that is so people and environmental oriented for such a sudden change, but I hope some of these recommendations help. I am going to definitely take your advice and ask for someone that specializes in DBT. I feel bad because I love my therapist, but I bluntly asked her if we are doing DTB, and she said no. I just struggle because I obviously want to make her happy? But I know therapy is for me to get better and I feel like I have just hit a wall."
BPD,fmmcack,t3_fw3ur2,1586202701.0,"ü•∫.. wow! Thank you so much, it means a-lot I feel like there‚Äôs so much outdated literature and I am excited knowing there‚Äôs a change for me to go into remission. üò≠‚ô•Ô∏è Thank you."
