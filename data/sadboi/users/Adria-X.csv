I have had so many psychologists try the same one-size-fits-all solutions, I've given up on it. CBT helped me a bit, but now psychologists keep coming back to the same stuff I already know and have developed habits about.... 

Which is why I now try to help myself out a bit more. People say that there is a danger with internet information in that people too often self-diagnose, but if no one else is going to make the effort to do the diagnosis then what else are we supposed to do...? The only way I got officially diagnosed with depression is by already knowing I was depressed. 

I may have gotten a bit off topic here, I hope that's ok... though I think it relates to why I find articles like this one so helpful. Reading through it I was like wow, so much of this describes me. Just being able to name the beast gives me some comfort--it helps me articulate what I'm going through and lets me know I'm not alone in this.... 

So thank you for sharing."

I suppose that ethically, my position on the matter can be boiled down to this: I do not think that the threat of poverty should be used to influence people's actions and I do not believe that people who do not work deserve to live in poverty. I don't know if that sounds a bit idealistic but I don't believe that poverty is essential to our society and I probably won't be changing my mind on that point.

I doubt that the need for labour will be negatively affected by a UBI, and that is where workers strikes draw their power. Jobs exist because someone needs that work to be done.

The threat of poverty is important to capitalism, I doubt they'd let it go that easily so perhaps you're right that efforts towards other things are more likely to be realised."
