Skin Type- Combination (closer to oily than dry)

Skin Goals- Removing light acne scars, postponing wrinkles as long as I can, brightening dark circles.

I am very open to constructive criticism and suggestions!

AM

1. Cetaphil Daily Cleanser- Gentle and doesn’t dry me out too much

2. Wipe with Thayers Witch Hazel Alcohol Free Toner using reusable cotton pads- Feel like it cleans my face a little more and it tightens my pores. I use reusable pads for the environment and so I don’t have to buy more.

3. Salt Late Supplements: Vitamin C Serum- for anti-aging and the hydraulic acid for its hydrating properties.

4. Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion- Always worked well for me.

5. Aveeno Positively Mineral Sensitive Skin Daily SuInscreen Lotion with SPF 50 wear this every day, even when it’s cloudy, because UV protection is the best defense against aging and skin cancer.

PM

1. Cetaphil Daily Cleanser (about once a week I’ll use a small exfoliating pad with this)

2. (Not Pictured) Make-Up wipes for my eyes if I wore makeup that day- My cleanser can’t remove my water-proof mascara on it’s own.

3. Thayers Witch Hazel Alcohol Free Toner

4. Insta Skincare: Retinol serum for face- Anti-aging. I only wear this at night because retinol makes your skin extra sensitive to UV.

5. Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion

6. Estee Lauder: Revitalizing Supreme- Anti-aging and also for my dark circles.

7. Mederma PM Intensive Overnight Scar Cream- for my acne scars"

Night:

2. Wipe with toner
3. Retinol
4. Moisturizer
5. Eye cream
6. Scar cream (acne scars)

*I also use a make-up remover wipe at night if I wore makeup that day"

My boyfriend and i jokingly hit each other pretty often cause i take self defense and sometimes he lets me practice on him.

That being said, i have asked him before if it bothers him and he said it’s fine so i got consent which is very important."
