I worked at a restaurant that was across the street from a PAC (Performing Arts Center) that had other people like Rob Thomas, Steve Miller Band, Alice cooper, etc.  Our restaurant would cater the PAC and the acts would come by after sometimes for our private rooms to drink.

Kathy Griffin was performing and came by for martinis after the show. She was as loud as she is in her ""act"" but with added rudeness. When asking for her order she rolled her eyes and told her assistant sitting on the other side of her to tell me the order and went back to her talk. She snapped her fingers ag workers too, and demanded multiple staff to wait on  them on a busy friday night.  It was a college town and we had 5 waiters for the whole place friday nights as we pooled tips.

While working in one irish pub for about a year and a half, I was typically the go to girl to work doubles and way too many days in a row.  The kitchen guys were typically unbearable, but over time they became more and more. One sait paddy's day as I was running food the second half if the day because I had worked a long shift already, I ran to the kitchen to ask them to fix a meal. The head chef looked me dead in the eyes and said ""I don't even hear what you're saying because I keep looking at your boobs""  I flipped and went to the manager to get him reeled in.

It was good for a while till he couldn't bite his tongue again. It was a Friday dinner shift, which was always packed as we were next door to the performing arts center, and I ran into the kitchen to speak to the chef, he looked at me and said ""How do you expect me to take you seriously with those"" and gestured to my chest. I walked out into the packed dining room screaming ""Fuck this I'm out!""  I got in my car and started to leave as my coworkers went out onto the porch of the restaurant in disbelieve and I called out of my window ""Fuck this place!""

Your loneliness is not invalid, I use to do the same thing to fill that void of feeling like no one loves me.

I learned to be comfortable with my own company, which also helped me to learn what I actually deserve in someone else and in a relationship. The pressure to be with someone is insane in a lot of societies, but to me I always wonder what is so wrong with ending up with myself?

mentalhealth,fl76bzd,t1_fl6pw68,1584895209.0,"Well first, self harm is seen as bad because of the risk factors that lead to the state of self harm due to the perception of the society.  In western culture, it is typically associated with mental pain or anguish in some way. One reason some may self harm is to see the physical pain that is being caused mentally.

A study has found that pain may actually be one way of coping with mental illness.  My self harm is covered by getting tattoos, like you said, but it's not the only reason for my tattoos its just one coping mechanism I do have, I also don'tlike the way my bare skin looks so I want to be covered in tattos.

As far as suicide, there is assisted suicide in many places, including, I think, 9 US states with proper medical support. 

I think the difference between assisted suicide for a severely ill or debilitated person and someone who suffers mental illness at a relatively young age is that we don't know what happens when you die, so why is the decision for death the best choice?  It becomes more of a philosophical question of do you try to battle out being here or do you take the plunge of something that results in the unknown.

People who say that suicide is selfish tend to not have a full understanding of the mental thought inside someone's head that is contemplating suicide. I mean yeah, you're going to fuck up some people in a very serious way, which is hard to see when you yourself are suffering  so much. I think the death of someone is harder to take than an addiction, as someone who has attempted one and been the other, those around me are way less hurt by my addiction than if they lost me forever. 

Death is an unknown no matter what you believe happens afterwards. Theres no way to prove or disprove what comes next, so I think that is why so many are against suicide, not just that you hurt people around you, but that not fighting while you know what is expected to happen here, but you gave into going to a place where you have no idea if there is a relief from what is happening in your mind."

My highs tended to take more extremes as putting my own life in danger because of feeling invincible or invulnerable. My lows consisted of attempts at suicide with hallucinating during highs and lows. After years I've found a balance of proper medications, which to not much understanding finding the right medications takes multiple tries of variations that work with you, and a balance of proper dietary working and exercise with mindfulness use and other workings

I'm in university now studying cognitive neuroscience so I tend to read studies that look at abnormal psychology and the like which have helped me have a better understanding of what may be happening with me, but also group meetings have helped me feel not alone in my situation, I was also in IOP programs which was duel diagnosis of my mental illness and substance abuse. 

Being able to relate to others was a HUGE help as well, knowing you aren't alone just makes it a bit easier.

They are not in a manic episode and BPD need a very specific therapy to maintain a normal life as medication does not work.

You should probably bring it up to your therapist.  It is very unwise and unhealthy to self diagnose.  If you have every taken a psych course past psych 101 in university, the professors always warn that the symptoms may seem like you have them, but trust anyone in the field almost everyone feels they can relate to them.

I'm a 28(f) who has had cystic, hormonal, and every kind of face skin thing possible. My boyfriend doesn't care if I have makeup or not, hes so attracted to me. Even when I was having one of the worst flare ups i have had in my late 20s with an accompanying allergic reaction with my face swollen.  If a person does not see past the acne, which is only a slight road bump, then they aren't as worth your time."
AskReddit,fb7uj07,t3_ebuquu,1576599692.0,"How many tattoos do you have?

Do tattoos hurt?

I am a fairly tattooed female, sleeves, leg sleeves.  It's more the random stranger in a Target who feels they have a right to grab my arm and ask the questions.  My tattoos are not an open invitation for you to grab me or even for you to ask me about them unless you are inquiring for where you might want to go to get one, that I can answer for you."

dating_advice,f9mvzpb,t3_e5t36p,1575471506.0,"That's just something that comes with age.  If you are even out at a bar, people tend to go with their friends and not random strangers. And actually, people drink less now than before, and hook ups, though maybe slight rise in hook ups, don't lead into sex as much as they use to.

It's more a matter of perspective. You are exposed to the social media life of people partying and drinking not the time they are sitting at home doing nothing.... happens to me always. I see my friends always out and about on social media so i believe that is their life. But it's not, they spend majority of time home and in bed or working and such."

dating_advice,f9epzor,t3_e4nhcq,1575248458.0,"I'm 28(f) and just initiated my first relationship type thing recently. I have never been with someone longer than 2 months.  I started dating about 2 or three years back, which includes that 2 month thing.  I think a huge part of it was because I needed to know myself before I could know someone else or let someone in.

How can you be with someone if you are uncomfortable with yourself and don't even know what you want?  I learned about me and that helped me to become more comfortable with rejection because I could also easier identify what I wasn't looking for, and typically I was rejected by people I wouldn't want to be with anyway."
mentalhealth,f84xvw7,t3_dz3afh,1574263277.0,"I have a way to help cope while in a panic/anxiety attack. There are grounding techniques such as the 5-4-3-2-1 which is 5 things you can see, 4 things you can feel, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste.

It averts your mind from the panic it is feeling rerouting you to the here and now.  I too have anxiety attacks which is just overwhelming panic about things that your mind may see as out of your control. They are manageable and able to be coped through. Having someone to talk to is very important as well, which I extend the invitation of me to you, but therapy is a huge component that is usually necessary."
dating_advice,f6w6xa3,t3_dt3ldo,1573218499.0,"I didn't start dating till I was about 26. I took most of my life as a way to figure myself out, what I want, who I am, and to become self aware.  I'm 28 and have been dating the past 2 years to no avail. I think overly investing too much into every date is what can be most draining. I don't believe in the if you look it won't happen, but I do believe that if you put too much effort into dating as a way to ""find love"" you are going to drain yourself and take too much of your attention away from who the most important person is in the situation. Yourself.

I'm currently a university student as I went back to school, work a full time job, and work in a lab. I make it known on my dates that my life is more important than them, in a very polite way because it is.  My mental health is the most important thing. Maybe you should step away because you are investing too much into love.  Right now, I have a third date planned and they understand my busy schedule and life. I mean hey my first ""real"" thing is at 28 so you have plenty of time."
