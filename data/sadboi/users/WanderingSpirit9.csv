gentlefemdom,fn2ll39,t1_fmsdy6a,1586593566.0,"As someone who has also suffered from depression, I am so glad to hear your story on overcoming depression; that journey takes a lot. You’ve been there. You know how awful it is. And it sounds as though your focus on not returning to that place of pain influences your unceasing support of your girlfriend, who you clearly care about a lot. You want to ensure she doesn’t end up there either.

But one thing I’ve learned, both as someone who has experienced mental illness, and as a friend, family member, and boyfriend of people who have experienced mental illness, the drive to change has to come from the person experiencing the hardship themself. Your support can be invaluable in the process of recovery, but if you are the only one pushing, nothing will change.

This piece: “I don't think she knows anything else than her current state of being and doesn't see what's wrong with it ” is telling. Up until this point it sounds like you’ve been trying to change her lifestyle so she is able to achieve what you deem the ideal form of happiness. And while that may be a worthy goal, it may not be the right thing for her, especially if the happiness you’re hoping for her to reach is defined in your terms rather than hers.

I know you’ve talked with her about whether she’s interested in learning more English or exercising, but if you were the one to come up with those plans, she might not feel personally invested in those activities. She may be defining “interest” as a vague desire to benefit from these things or a desire to do these things with or for you, while your definition may be a driving motivation to consistently work out or master English. If it’s true your perspectives differ in this way, then your expectations of her may not be on her radar at all, while they’re paramount to you. it sounds like you perceive her life as stopped, or on pause. This seems to be something that hurts you, understandably so, as you know the pain of feeling stuck and do everything in your power to prevent that from happening again. That desire to avoid being stuck has extended into your girlfriend’s life. But your way of overcoming it may not be her way. You are involved in changes in her life, but these kinds of lifestyle changes may not be what she’s looking for. What are your expectations of her? Are they realistic? What are her expectations for you? Are those expectations realistic? Talk to her. Listen to her. Remember that the hardest conversations are often the most rewarding.

Talk about the things you’ve described here -- finding an English teacher, going to the gym with her, driving long distances to see her -- and discuss what those actions mean to you, as her partner, and ask her what they mean to her. Expecting considerable lifestyle and outlook changes from your girlfriend that she isn’t aware you’re anticipating isn’t fair to her; but being put into the role of “energy provider” and motivator isn’t fair to you. Tell her how much her negativity and lack of energy around things is affecting you and talk to her about what influences her negative outlook on life, so that hopefully you can both come to better understand one another and strengthen your relationship.

I hope I was able to offer some assistance. I wish you all the best! Good luck, friend."

KindVoice,ff3tm7j,t3_eraloo,1579548583.0,"I rarely hung out with people throughout elementary, middle, and high school, but I rarely felt lonely because I read so much. Reading books -- especially fantasy, science fiction, and historical fiction -- allowed me to escape my day-to-day and travel somewhere entirely new. Reading also made learning easier for me; my writing improved as I implemented the grammar and spelling I saw so much in books into my own works, and books offered information about things I was interested in and taught me details about people and history I wouldn't have learned otherwise. Reading for pleasure isn't for everyone, certainly, but I know there have been many times in my life when a book threw me into a thrill of emotions and thoughts that I hadn't experienced before and stayed with me for a long time after.

Anther thing that's helped me considerably is [James Clear's website](https://jamesclear.com/articles). I'm not super fond of self help books and the like, but James Clear's articles are more of a presentation of information than enthusiastic directions on how you should live. He offers straightforward tools without pushing them on you, focusing on [the power of habits](https://jamesclear.com/habits), and I've found his insights quite effective in my own life.

Enough with the advice, though... Friend, it hurts me to hear how you're struggling. I've walked the dark paths of depression before and they look like what you're describing: lack of motivation, not caring about anything, feeling tired all the time, wishing you could just die. Have you considered seeing a therapist? Finding a therapist who clicks with you can do all kinds of wonders for mental health. 

Looking through your comment history you sound like a really genuine and kind person. You feel like you don't contribute anything, but the world needs more people like you. Break the routine you feel stuck in and branch out, friend. This world has more to offer, and you have so much to offer as well. I wish you all the best and I hope you take care."

MensLib,fdijcqc,t1_fdfdjxm,1578444211.0,"Hey friend, you aren't sick or deficient. I'm sorry to hear the people you are close to aren't supportive of you; the ""robot"" comment was cruel and the idea that having platonic friendships with women makes you less of a man (or person -- wow) says a lot more about them than it does about you. There are absolutely people out there who would be glad to see you as you are and celebrate you in your entirety. If this is something that bothers you (or something you'd just be interested in determining) you could check your testosterone levels. I'm also a trans guy who went on T, but my sex drive (for lack of a better term) didn't change very much from before I went on T. But hormones do different things for different people, as my and the original commenter's experiences show, so none of us can say what T would do for you. As with most things, you'd want to talk to your doctor.

Sex drive is different than sexual attraction. I'm asexual (technically ace-spec, but essentially ace), and I have a high sex drive. It's different for everyone. Asexuality simply implies that you don't experience sexual attraction (a targeted desire to have sex with someone), but seeing as you're using the label more for other's convenience than a personal identity, I suppose the definition might not matter as much.

I hate how much importance society places on sex and it's disturbing how it gets to the point where it ruins peoples lives and ostracizes people who don't experience attraction/drive the same way as the majority. You are valid, friend, just as you are. I hope you take care. <3"

Asexual,f8rz016,t3_e1g2lh,1574760360.0,"The key thing, as with any relationship, is communication. Being asexual means different things for different people: for some, the very idea of sex is repulsive, while for others, sex might be something they're interested in having they just don't feel sexual attraction to other people. It depends on the person; you should ask your partner how she feels about sex.

Asexuality at its core means a lack of sexual attraction: someone who is ace (short for asexual)  doesn't have a targeted desire to have sex with someone. There are others identities and labels within the ace spectrum that experience this to varying degrees or based on particular circumstances. [http://wiki.asexuality.org/Asexuality](http://wiki.asexuality.org/Asexuality) has more information.

While having these conversations with her, consider your own sexual needs. There's the possibility that she isn't interested in sex at all. How important is sex to you in a relationship? Sex isn't everything (in my personal opinion), but if it's something you feel you need, you should consider whether being incompatible in this matter is a dealbreaker. If not, then I wish you all the best as you explore your relationship further! It sounds like your both invested in each other and trust each other, which is super cool, so good luck!
