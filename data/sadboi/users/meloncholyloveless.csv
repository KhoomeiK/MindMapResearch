I truly hope you see this response OP.

Having been through something similar myself, all I can say is I'm deeply sorry for your loss AND DON'T GIVE BACK THE JACKET! 

Your loved one may have been her daughter, but she was your partner. The jacket is something that keeps her with you. You have gone above and beyond by offering her your partner's necklace and photos, especially where you have so few mementos of your partner left, and you're still grieving. 

Went through something similar with a family member myself, when my grandfather passed (he was my hero) I asked for ONE thing, that I had to fight tooth and nail for because my uncle (who I'm convinced is mentally unwell himself) started taking belongings, left right and center. I did finally get the one thing I was after (suspenders of all things...and not fancy/expensive ones) but I had to fight with him for them. He's hoarded away so many things that belonged to my grandparents, and most of those I'm pretty sure aren't being cared for properly, or have been sold off.

I understand that this is her mother that you're having a problem with but honestly, that shouldn't matter. Your partner made YOU her next of kin, end of subject.

As a mentally unwell person myself, I could NEVER get rid of the things that remind me of a loved one (I still have toys that belong to my older children and they're 20ish now). I am sorry that her mother can't control her life enough to not either lose or purge away things that she now wishes she had kept. But that does not mean she has the right to ask for something that now belongs to you. Her mental illness is NOT an excuse.

For future reference, since mom seems so keen to involve others in this, simply tell them that you have offered other special sentimental things to mom, but that she's focused ONLY on the jacket, but seeing as it was left to you by your partner it's not something you're willing to part with. If that doesn't work it might be beneficial to your own mental well being to block/cut out those people for a while. Surround yourself with people who love and care for YOU OP, not the people who are willingly ignoring your needs in favor of your partner's (imho) entitled mother.

I wish you light, love, and healing OP."

Anxiety is a BIG thing for someone with bipolar, and it can take a lot to get it under control...I use both an anti-anxiety med and weed when needed...the anti-anxiety med helped immensely. Also, the porn watching is helping him find a non self-injury way of getting relief from his anxiety which is also fine. He could also be suffering from hypersexuality, which is another issue that bipolar disorder tends to come with...unfortunately all our brains can thing about sometimes is sex, sex, and more sex...there really isn't much that we can do about it, meds can help to a degree, but they either don't help enough...or can kill your sex drive completely.

My SO will prep the shower for me (get my razor, find my sponge, shampoo, conditioner etc) and start it for me, and get the temp pretty close to what I want (just about boiling), that way the only thing I have to do is get undressed and get in. Once I'm in the shower I'm usually fine.

I'm a ""mama bear"" when it comes to my kids in one thing only...you hurt my children, I will hurt you...and only applicable to those who should know better (i.e. an adult hits my child intentionally...they will be getting hit right back) 

My kids know damned well to behave around others, they don't usually run wild, because that sucks for everyone. And if they've made a mistake, or acted badly we both apologize for being/doing wrong. 

I have never had a problem with someone disciplining my child if they feel that my kids are out of line, because let's face it, they're kids and sometimes they can be total little assholes. I love my kids, but I also understand that my parenting style is not always the same as someone else's, and if we're out visiting they know they have to abide by the rules of whoever's place we're at. It's mom's rules at home, auntie's rules at her house, etc. They can run wild at home all they please because this is their place to do so, that doesn't allow them to do it elsewhere. 

It's not our house, so we don't treat it as such. Those aren't our things, so we treat them nicely. We're visiting, so you obey the rules of where you happen to be. Plain and simple. I hate parents that can't seem to grasp that concept."

bipolar,fb81esb,t3_ebutr8,1576604036.0,"I can understand what you're saying...however I must disagree....

when I'm depressed or manic I can tend to lash out at the people closest to me and say or do some of the most horrible things...and while I don't ALWAYS have the ability to keep my damned mouth shut I do my best to do so...because I KNOW that what I'm saying or thinking is skewed...I know it's the illness and not how I actually feel at that moment...and I always make a point to apologize afterwards, because even if I didn't have the ability to keep it to myself I know that it was still wrong. 

Some things we do are excusable, but that doesn't mean it gives us an out for all of our shitty behavior during an episode. 

I'm a selfish, nasty, hateful bitch when I'm both manic and depressed...I am not normally that way, so luckily the people that love me know that if I'm being that way that it's not really ""me"". However, that doesn't give me license to hurt others just because I'm hurting. I have never lost my sense of right and wrong no matter how badly I'm feeling in that moment...and I do/say things to hurt others knowing damned well that is the only reason for doing so...being bipolar doesn't give me an excuse for acting that way because I still know it's WRONG even if I can't always stop myself from doing it.

I think the phrase is meant to warn us that no matter what we do during an episode we will still have to face the consequences of those actions. If we did wrong and know it, we need to apologize and realize that fact. 

We can't get through life saying that because we're bipolar we should be excused for everything we do because we can't help it. Maybe a lot of the time we can't, but we can apologize (sincerely) after the fact for the wrongs we've done...and we can still make the effort to TRY to not do it again.

My oldest child has Asperger's...there are many things about his behavior that are excused due to that...but he still tries to do better and work on things that he knows he's not always in control (or even aware) of. I never let his diagnosis allow him to be a shitty human being. He's compassionate and kind, he's smart and funny. He has very poor impulse control and has texture and motor skills problems...but we have worked with him on them...and while they are not ""perfect"" and never will be he's doing better because we didn't let it become an excuse for him. He used to throw horrible tantrums, screaming, hitting, biting...but learned that doing that hurts people and even if he still feels like doing those things he won't because he knows it'll hurt someone else. He knows his health is going to be a factor when he gets older, because he eats mainly carbos and dairy and fruits...can't get the kid to eat a damned veggie or meat...but he also is willing to try new things in order to find something healthier he likes. We could have allowed his Asperger's to be his excuse for his horrific eating, much like the school counselors wanted to, but didn't. He's different, always will be, but that difference is not an excuse for less than stellar behavior.

Our illness in itself is not an excuse for our behavior, we can learn to change our behavior or to be honestly apologetic about it when things go out of our control. Part of taking our meds is to mitigate the things we do during an episode. If you do EVERYTHING within your power to better yourself, and to keep from doing wrong...and something still goes wrong, yes THEN I could consider our illness the excuse...as there's only so much we can do. And even then I don't think it's really an excuse...as much as the cause for WHY this is as good as things can get. 

I think as far as other people's opinions on mental illness go, they know there are things in place to help people with a mental illness, and programs to help. What they don't seem to understand or know is that it's a constant balancing act between, meds...lifestyle...therapy...etc that keep us somewhat normal...they believe if we take the pill, or sleep more, or talk to someone it all goes away. When it doesn't work that way. 

There are also too many of us who don't do the things that will help (me especially) I drink too much caffeine, and smoke too much...I have only now just gotten back into therapy...and i've been meds noncompliant for almost 2 years...so it's on me...for not doing the things that make my illness more manageable. That is my fault, and I'm aware of it...but that does not mean that my illness is an excuse for it...because it's not..I am WILLINGLY ignoring what I know helps...because I just don't want to deal with the hassle of it all. 

Part of knowing that I am wrong about it, is that I know I'm starting to spiral out of control again...so I've started therapy again, I'm monitoring my eating again, and my caffeine intake, I'm sleeping a little better...and eventually I'll get back on medication. I'm not using my illness as an excuse for my own shitty behavior...There is no excuse when the reason for it is because I'm not doing the things to make it better.

There is no excuse for my behavior, especially when I'm not doing a damned thing to ensure I'm getting the help I need for my mental illness.

My mental illness is not an excuse for the shitstorm in my life.

I can blame my actions all I want on it, but that is me deflecting from the fact that at the end of the day, my actions are still MY actions...I still made the choice to do them, right or wrong. In the end the blame for doing something wrong sill lays with me."

offmychest,f7t9pyw,t3_dxgtoe,1574002412.0,"Thank you OP for all that you do. The mom in me thanks you for saving that little boy, and is also mad at your mom for saying such a thing out loud to you...I understand her pov, but it's still not something you should say to your child, especially if it's hurting them. I hope you are able to find some peace for yourself. I know it's not the same, but this mom think's you've done nothing short of a miracle for that little boy. I'd hug you if I could, but you'll have to settle for an internet one instead."
bipolar,f7kxsee,t3_dwjrki,1573828760.0,"Talk to your doctors about your concerns, they may have some good insight for you, or be able to point you in a direction to help you find answers. It totally can be done...but it's a LOT of work. Pregnancy can be hard for a normal person (mood swings, irritability, pregnancy brain...which is a worse version of brain fog etc) and it makes it harder for us where we're already prone to all of those things. Working with your doctor is imperative, or finding an ob/gyn that has previous experience with bipolar patients.

I have schizoaffective rapid cycling bipolar I...I wasn't diagnosed properly until after my 2 oldest kids, but was being treated for clinical depression and had to go off meds while pregnant...it was rough, but they were worth every second of it. I went back on meds while at the hospital after having my 2nd child (no breastfeeding for me sadly). I had been diagnosed bipolar I by the time I had my 3rd child, but opted to stay off meds in order to try breastfeeding her, it didn't work out and I went back on meds when she was around 6 months old. 

I don't know how well it will work for someone with autism, my oldest is high functioning and loves children...hes helped with all his little cousins and his baby sister, and did a fabulous job at it. I see no reason why you couldn't do it too.

Good luck OP <3"
