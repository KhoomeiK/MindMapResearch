AskReddit,fr0re6t,t1_fqzbvfz,1589804802.0,"My mother was terrible for this. She would literally say things like I was buddha/jesus reincarnated and I was amazing in every way. Even now when I try to explain how damaging that is and how much pressure it puts on a kid she’ll say “I’m just being honest, I can’t help but tell you how incredible you are. I’m so glad you’re not like the other kids, I couldn’t stand having one of those normal stupid children” 
Of course then when I did anything that a “normal” kid would do or made any mistakes that were common for my age I was terrible and was clearly trying to spite her and be a terrible kid. It made it pretty difficult to make friends when you’re basically told all your peers are terrible and you’re supposed look down on them even when I could clearly see a lot of them were actually better at a lot of things."
therapy,fqhrapj,t1_fqgn18p,1589382819.0,"Thanks, I wasn’t really sure how that whole process works so I’ll have to make sure I’m looking for psychologists when the time comes. The therapists I’ve seen have been helpful in finding ways to cope I just think their focus was in the wrong direction and if I can have a diagnosis or just something close to what’s going on with me to explain to them they could help a lot better"
DID,fq89hl6,t3_gh7b1x,1589161234.0,"That must be really frustrating. I can’t imagine how it would feel to lose all your belongings and not be able to express yourself. Are you guys able to communicate and if so do you think you’d be able to have a discussion about how you’re feeling and maybe some compromises you can come up with? 
I know personally I’m a female host with mostly male alters so I try to make sure everyone has at least a few pieces of clothes they like wearing and stuff they like around the house so they can feel comfortable. I agree with the person above that as a system you’re not going to have things completely your way but your host needs to recognize that too. 
As far as dysphoria goes I don’t experience it a ton so I may not be the best to talk but I think having any major permanent change to the body is something that everyone should be agreeing to. Maybe you could talk with them and see if there are some non permanent things they could try or you guys could agree to partial transitioning but not full? 
Your host may have done things before they knew about you that you didn’t like but now that they are aware they need to be mindful that they’re not the only one with opinions on how your life should be lived"
DID,foi1wua,t1_fohx80c,1587777036.0,It’s honestly amazing though how much your brain can do to keep you from noticing something if it doesn’t want you to. You can make excuses for almost everything and the things you can’t excuse you just believe are things everyone does or try to ignore them (in my experience anyways). Even now memories will come up and suddenly things will make so much more sense. Most people don’t really have a reason to analyze every memory or experience they’ve had until they’re faced with proof that something is wrong so it’s pretty normal to have those realizations. And even after you do realize a lot of the time your brain turns to the whole “this isn’t real you’re faking it” thing as a last ditch effort
DID,fohwmjy,t3_g7f2ao,1587774067.0,"In all fairness, I (host) could tell since I was a kid that there was something off about me but I never knew exactly what and I just assumed I had strange quirks

- talking to myself and explaining things so all the “parts of my brain” were on the same page and knew what had to be done that day

- having my brain basically shut down and having my emotions and thoughts turn off for a while, especially during stress. Dissociation in general just made me think I was dying but after a while I got used to it 

- feeling like my life was a dream and that I was stuck in a body that didn’t belong to me, also feeling strange when I look in a mirror because that’s not how I’m supposed to look

- knowing vaguely that bad things have happened to me because I was told but when a therapist or someone would ask I couldn’t tell them any specifics

- (this one is so obvious I don’t know how I didn’t realize anything) my friend in my head who told me he was a gatekeeper and would tell me during bad situations that I had to let someone else take over things for a while 

- listening to different parts argue about what we should do, how we should deal with situations and having protecters try to tell the persecutors to take it easy on me"
DIDmemes,fnyez8w,t3_fh3i5y,1587361129.0,I’ve tried drawing everyone but I get disappointed and some of them get annoyed that it doesn’t come out right so I usually look around online and whenever I come across someone who looks super similar I’ll trace their features and add on the rest of the details to make it them. Sims is good for this too and since animal crossing has been out whoever starts it up first gets to pic our outfit/hair for the day
workingmoms,fnxvz2y,t3_g2tcm3,1587347516.0,"I guess I’m lucky as far as that goes that my partner still can get that way sometimes. We have a pretty good understanding of things, he takes care of things in the morning while I sleep in and relax and then I do my part in the afternoon/evening. 
The only way I’ve really found that can make guys more “independent” as far as household work goes is just leaving it to them to do and figure out until eventually it just becomes something they do without asking. The hardest part to me is letting him do it when he decides to and not giving in and doing the thing myself but as long as you partner isn’t a total slob eventually the mess will bother them enough to want to do it. Splitting up chores can be good since people are less likely to do a chore if they don’t like it. but still don’t ask them to do it or do it for them. 
As far as taking care of the kids goes I don’t ever ask unless I know he has plans of some sort. I just tell him I’m going out and when I’ll be back and that the baby is staying home. He’s well aware of the schedule and just does whatever has to be done. 
Another thing is that I don’t thank him for doing the chores he’s supposed to do, I will if he’s doing something above and beyond or if he takes over a chore for me for a day but I don’t treat him like doing his part around the house is something remarkable (although from the sound of these comments, apparently it is). I also try not to feel guilty about the house being messy if it’s only messy because he hasn’t done his chores. I feel like as women we’ve been taught that if the house doesn’t look good or the kids are dirty or something then it’s our fault and we’re to blame but I’m not going to feel bad because of someone else’s choices."
DID,fn747zl,t3_fzf4co,1586712974.0,"Thank you for all the nice replies, I wasn’t expecting to be so accepted. It’s actually a huge relief just to know that it’s ok and other people out there feel the same way I do ☺️"
DID,fn46op4,t1_fn45qlg,1586635154.0,"Thank you, I’ll have to look into that. I’m in canada so I don’t know if things are quite the same here but I could still try. From what I heard we’re lacking in specialists/therapists with training on DID up here so I’d most likely have to do online sessions."
Nurse,fmdnemr,t1_fmdmuay,1585972373.0,Maybe? Neither of us have ever been on leave before until his medical one so we weren’t quite sure what was out there or how to apply. He was concerned that even if they couldn’t fire him for taking the leave they would fire him when he got back. I suppose he could look into it though because at this point keeping his job is more of a side thought. Thank you for the idea!
AskWomen,fm359de,t3_fsdyhu,1585713219.0,"Not exactly in great shape anymore but working on it, I’ve never had a problem with dating chubbier people. I don’t think looks or weight are much of a dealbreaker to me, but of course you need to still be able to be attracted to the person. What’s more important I think is if they’re independent, have similar values, you can enjoy their company and have fun together, and if they’re emotionally healthy and mature."
mentalillness,flpn73h,t1_flpcdit,1585363593.0,I had considered those as I dealt with some addiction when I was younger but I didn’t know if I needed it or belonged there since it’s been so long. Do they tell anyone that you’re going or make you register or anything? I wouldn’t want them to tell someone and then cps come because they believe I’m a current addict or neglecting my baby. I know that I’m being paranoid at this point but this has really messed up my trust for anyone and from what I’ve seen online cps can take your child for pretty much no reason and nobody will argue with them. I’d be willing to give it a try though even if it were just to have people to talk to
mentalillness,floxr8h,t3_fpjr4c,1585347639.0,That happens a lot of the time when I’m going through really stressful events. I never knew if it was fully considered dissociation or not because I’m technically still conscious. I can still see and hear a little bit but I can’t control my body and I usually either don’t move or my body goes into autopilot and starts cleaning or something. It’s very strange but sort of peaceful in a way because it usually distances me from the emotions until I snap out of it.
