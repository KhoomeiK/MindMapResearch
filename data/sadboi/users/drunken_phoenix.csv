I felt honestly dumb cause I felt like I had no idea what I was doing, and still feel that way, but the woman who did a house inspection was fantastic, and my realtor, also a woman, talked me through everything and explained everything like I was 5. Very appreciative of both of them.

I’m still going through escrow now. I’m scared haha."

depression,etmt0fr,t1_etlrbr1,1562967835.0,"I just started down this path for about a year now, for the first time experience depression and anxiety. I’m 26. I relate to this a lot, my parents did a lot for me but I honestly don’t see how I can blame them for how I feel? I don’t see how them being “phenomenal” parents who made life easy for me before going to college be a reason for losing my ambition? I’m sufficiently independent, I had hobbies, I cooked, I worked out, i realized it wasn’t making me happier, and it all felt pointless working so hard. I’ve been doing nothing for 4 months straight, I don’t feel any worse, I just don’t know what to do, searching for happiness now.

I definitely used to have a bigger ego, now feeling like a failure."

Right now I’m kind of eyeing Memphis and Nashville just because those are cities I’d be willing to explore myself.

And no I don’t have to relocate but that’s my own personal endeavor, to explore a bit, more for myself. And only temporarily, since I can work from home I want to focus on traveling while I can. I want to make purchasing my first investment property a part of that.

I’m terms of neighborhoods, I’m hoping to buy in very safe neighborhoods with good quality tenants, of course that’s my hope. Middle class, hard working people. Either that or college towns.

No I don’t want to quit my current job. I’m going to try to handle both, and if I can’t I will hire a property manager."
AmItheAsshole,epfxlvw,t1_epfo1vj,1559203240.0,"Yeah I agree, this really split the room, leaning far against me. It’s not too expensive for him, it’s about “fairness”, him and a few people pointed out as unfair for me to raise rent in the favor of me and my friend without me disclosing it as so.

He knew the rent of the total unit, he knew his share, and the percentage his share contributes, he was just upset he learned I’m paying less than him. Fair? Outside of what I did, sure, definitely a fair price, considering market rates for rooms like his. Considering what I did? The majority said no.

I agree with you though."
AmItheAsshole,epdpsi0,t1_epdo1ya,1559171257.0,"He did sign the lease knowing the full amount of the unit. He thought I was paying as much as he was, and thought the master was paying less."

But I will make sure for my last month here to split the rooms 50/50. Funny thing is, he is ok pay less than 50/50 for the person who takes my room.

Thanks for the input."
AmItheAsshole,epdfiby,t1_epddc9k,1559165414.0,"The thing is there is no contract that states the price of the room. So we could technically renegotiate at anytime.

I am moving out next month and his rent will decrease. I am however refusing to renegotiate the price the last month that I live here.

I'm definitely in the cross-hairs when my friend should be too, he should definitely be paying way more for the masters, but I let him have it for cheaper since he found the spot and helped negotiate the price down for everyone. Nonetheless, I'm happy with what he's paying, and I'm happy with what I'm paying. 3rd roommate was happy with what he was paying, which to me make it relevant to what my room and the master is renting for."

I am hearing you out, I agree, it isn't decent, but I don't believe it is unethical. He found this place for a great price.

No, I’m a bit behind on how to break them down, in the next two months I’m planning on using some bigger pocket calculators, to learn a bit more about it.
