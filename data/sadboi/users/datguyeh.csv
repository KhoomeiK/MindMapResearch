Anxiety,fld7y86,t3_fnuncn,1585058742.0,Oh definatley feel this way as soon as the sun goes down. The loneliness begins to creep in and i see the articles and new cases getting posted and the amount on anxiety it brings keeps me awake for hours. Part of this is knowing that my place of business has no shot of shutting down right now. Knowing that i could expose myself and bring it home to my family is a stressful scary thing. The reality is there is alot of isolation happening and precautions i can take to get through these times. Stay safe and remember you are one of 7 billion people all going through this. Stay positive. Cheers.

gzcl,f7ozho5,t3_dx5l4n,1573938272.0,"New to this subreddit. Starting to get back into lifting and this program works well with my home gym set up. That being said i have a few questions. 

Currently running gzclp and want to know if its okay to add in an extra t2 lift and additional t3. So essential id have a t1 two t2 lifts and 2-3 t3 lifts per day. The volume im accuostomed to from my previous u/l 5x5 has me wanting to make some additions.  The t2's im interested in adding in are front squats, rdl's, snatchgrip high pulls.  And for t3's my main focus is on core muscles, shoulder health and arms.  Will be runming the program 3.5 - 4x a week depending on my shift rotation (12hr shift worker). Thanks for any input, cheers."

Fitness,f64s9v6,t3_dqi6i1,1572695664.0,in terms of leg muscle development. how far apart should my lifts be for backsquat vs deadlift and front squat vs romanian dl. want to make sure one doesnt get to dominant.

coming back after a year off due to some shoulder injury and laziness. lost all my muscle mass but on the positive ive built a small homegym now. Wanted something similar to stronglifts or ss. running an.upper lower for now to get back some linear gains. looking for recomendations for add ons. only have a barbell squat stand and db's up to 40lbs right now.

Upper day
Flat Bench 3x5  5lbs increase a week
OHP 3x5 + 5lbs a week
BB Row 3x5
pull ups bodyweight for now 3x10 or amrap
barbell bicep curls 3x8-12
skullcrusher 3x8-12

Lower days
lowbar backsquat 3x5 +10lbs a week
conv deadlift 3x5 +10 week
leg ups 3x15
crunches 3x15

rest day and repeat

on legs i want to incorporate front squats and rdl's on every other lower day. probably subbing out dl or backsquat on a rotation. 

general goals are strength right now but aesthetics in the long run. anything else i should add?"
Fitness,f5c7dl6,t1_f5c70xa,1572131176.0,after i read your post again i saw the lunges issue. you could put the leg your stepping back on a bench for stability. still targets the quads real good.
Fitness,f5c70xa,t3_dnl7yh,1572131060.0,you add barbell lunges and good mornings in as well for leg work(standing calf raise for aesthetics) depends on your goals and training level but squats and deads are a good start. depending on the intensity of those it may be all you need on some leg days. cheers!

Keep an eye on craigslist or kijiji and goto yard sales. part of the my weekend fun is finding vintage tools at yardsales and learning the story of where they came from. it saves you tons of money and you get some cool stories along the way. cheers!"
