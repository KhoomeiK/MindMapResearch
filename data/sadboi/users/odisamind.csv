Do the negative thought patterns come first? or the depression, or the 'chemical imbalance'? Or are they all woven together? I believe everyone's form of depression is different."

And no, you are not a horrible person for being like this. You are not a horrible person now matter how deep your depression, even if you kinda feel like you put yourself there. That's why depression is so cunning. It lures you in for the comfort, familiarity, and protection from reality, but it keeps you under by convincing you that you're a horrible person for letting yourself go down so far. Then you might tell yourself that you deserve to feel this way. But in reality you deserve to feel like a regular functional and healthy human being. You deserve to feel the sun and take in the sky. You deserve to feel beauty and be moved by compassion. You deserve to even feel simple joys that you may never share with anyone else. We all deserve this. I hope that many of us in this sub can experience this more if we allow ourselves to practice it."
PsychedelicTherapy,fh55xzf,t3_f12yod,1581285325.0,"I use psilocybin for depression (at home, facemask, music) and sometimes will take smaller doses alone (2.5g max). It has always been beneficial for me. Even if I experience some anxiety during the trip I always feel confident that I can breath into it and calm myself. If you trip alone, I would recommend a lower dose. I've had some very beneficial trips on just 2g.

I have always used a sitter for 3.5g+ trips. Recently I did 5 grams and was very glad I had a sitter. After coming down I lost all emotional feeling for about an hour. It didn't feel bad, because there was no feeling at all, but I had an intellectual understanding that something wasn't working within me. It seemed that there was a disconnection between my mind and heart. My sitter did wonders in helping me talk through it and then lead me in a meditation to help me 'feel' grounded again. My fully realm of emotions came back within a couple hours. If I didn't have a sitter, I may have spent a lot more time sitting in the void of nothingness by myself, which just didn't feel like a healthy place for me."

depression,fh50l3w,t3_f1djgl,1581283898.0,"Hi friend. I have often felt this and have recently found a way to use this idea of being ""addicted to depression"" to improve my mental health. Not saying this will help you, but perhaps there's something you can take from my story.  


It began with an awareness that once I started to dip into a depression, I would begin to feel a pull towards it, an attraction. Sort of like I would allow myself to be brought down into a dark but strangely comforting hole. I often describe my depression as alluring and cunning. I find a false comfort in it, a reason to avoid reality.   


I've felt like this for years and years but just a couple months ago I was meeting with my therapist. Something he said triggered me to blurt out ""I think depression is my addiction."" Confessing that verbally in someone else's presence caused a shift in the way I think about my depression. Suddenly I was able to just allow myself to have positive feelings. There was a feeling that maybe I've been exacerbating my depressed moods by purposely limiting any positive experience or thought. I felt guilty and ashamed about it, much like an addict might feel shame for their drug habit that negatively affects important relationships.   


I spent some time meditating on this idea of treating my depression as addiction. I visualized it differently and ultimately felt like I had more control. I still feel that I have a stronger than average propensity toward experiencing depressed moods, but I also feel that I have control into how addicted I allow myself to become. I'm only several months into this experiment of thinking differently about my depression, but it has brought me a new level of mental clarity and even some hope, so I'm going with it. It has also allowed me to overcome the fear of making some major life changes (quitting my profession, selling car, reevaluating what I value).  


I know everyone experiences depression differently, but if our versions of it are at all similar, I would recommend trying to fully admit an addiction to it. Then spend some time sitting with your emotions. Meditate. If you feel negative emotions, do your best to observe them. Don't avoid them, but also don't invite them to stay around longer than they naturally do. If you feel positive emotions, observe them first, then engage them. Tell yourself that it's okay to feel positive emotions. It's okay to feel okay. It's okay to even feel happy.   


I've been working on this for several months. At the beginning, the amount of positive emotions I was having was close to none, but each time I found something I would try to expand on it. Don't feel frustrated when the depression comes back, just wait for the next positive moment and engage it. It's a mental exercise; observe the negative, engage the positive. It takes mental effort. It is work. Treat it like you would treat exercise for your physical body."
PsychedelicTherapy,fcpcyng,t3_ei87d1,1577858764.0,"Fellow dad here.  I'm new to shrooms and have gone through that decision a couple times.  Free time is rare as a parent so I understand the desire to do it even if the timing doesn't feel perfect.  If you decide to go for it, one option is to take an even smaller dose, maybe 1g or less.  Don't expect a life changing trip, but think of it more as a greeting or handshake with the medicine. As crazy as it sounds, literally ask the shrooms to be gentle with you. Meditate on that before ingestion. I have found that this puts my mind in a state of respect and love. I wrote a little bit about that in the ""approach"" portion of my 1st trip report.

This is very much how I feel.

>Identity is just an idea

After I left religion I had an identity crisis and have been searching for new labels to define my identity, yet most labels are frustratingly insufficient. I've been so focused on what my identity is that I've never considered that identity is a human created concept used to classify people yet doesn't actually describe who someone really is. Thank you for the new thought process."
