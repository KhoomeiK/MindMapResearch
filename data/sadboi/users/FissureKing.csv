With the Right in charge that is all turned on it's head.

Now the states have to bid against each other for what is needed to protect their citizens. This drives up the cost and leaves states scrambling for equipment. Inefficient and expensive.

I don't know who was behind this idea but I would bet they bought stock in the supply companies.

So now the Federal government seizes any equipment the states buy from other suppliers and gives it to those five now very valuble companies and making the states bid on them.

Corruption at the mere price of the lives of American citizens.
