To joke about Hitler and the holocaust is a good way to get an uncomfortable laugh out of someone. 

I genuinely don’t think a lot of people understand the magnitude of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It’s taught as a footnote in schools, and the general attitude was ‘they had it coming’ and ‘but it saved lives!
