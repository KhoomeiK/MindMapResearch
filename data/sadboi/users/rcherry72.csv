She is an Eastern Screech Owl. The tree she lived in was cut down. She suffered a concussion and her babies fell as well. Willow proved to be a great mother to her babies and they were all able to be released. Her eyesight was impaired from the concussion so she wasn't able to be released. 

She is now taken on programs to teach people about wildlife and lives at the center. I don't remember her age exactly but she is getting pretty old for a bird in captivity. I have been interning for about a month now and am getting introduced to handling. I have pictures of me handling her but am self-conscious so didn't post them haha. It is an honor to be able to handle wildlife and I am super grateful to have found my true dream career path."
