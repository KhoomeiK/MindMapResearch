One explanation I was given by my new dr was that if you haven’t had children and thus have a bit smaller cervix, it can be hard for all of the uterine lining (especially if you’re a heavy bleeder) to get out during your period, and your uterus contracts extra hard, to essentially kinda fling the lining and old blood (which clots) off and out. Which causes the extra pain beforehand. Since you had your period recently, I feel like it could be that.


I agree with everybody saying to check with your doctor, which you’re already doing (or trying to do amidst the whole pandemic thing), and I thought maybe giving the explanation my doctor gave me (I think I’ve finally found a great OB/GYN, she’s really knowledgeable in this realm of abnormal menstruation and whatnot) might help you feel less alone :) Hope everything’s okay!"
AskReddit,fkle4ly,t3_fj0laa,1584304361.0,"I dated a guy who lied about having heart cancer for around a year to keep me from breaking up with him. He had been caught in some suspicious situations involving other women a couple of times, but had enough plausible deniability for my brain to be like “Let’s not jump to conclusions! Hear him out!” Eventually it got to be too much and I tried to leave him a few times (usually resulting in the classic “If you do this, I’m killing myself!!!”) so he invented a tumor in the soft tissue near his heart. Even tried to send me a fake note from his doctor, but too many things were just a little off...e.g., he went to a dentist a bit before this all started and told me that Dr. So-and-So was his chemo Dr, until I found a card in his house for the dentist he had seen with the same name (and not a common one). Also worth noting that the whole thing was ALSO constructed as a reason he was still communicating with an ex. Ended up finding out he just had a whole other girlfriend in the city where he was living. Like, for 6 months. So I threw his xbox out his window. Never done that kind of thing before but holy shit it had been a fucked up year and a half together.

Edit: as for silliest out of all that, he claimed that he was unwilling to share any paperwork with me or his family (just so we could help him pay for it) because he was “embarrassed” that he was “peeing himself sometimes due to chemo.” Really stuck by that one, too."
