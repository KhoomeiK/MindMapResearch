I was told to call for a med check apt when I got to 5 pills or she'd see me in 6 weeks.  Got to my 6 week apt, still had 8 pills and gave her the journal.  She flipped through, just skimming my journal.  She asked if I wanted refills as she felt I reacted well and obviously wasn't a drug seeker.

As for your husband, coping skills differ for everyone.  Ask him if every coping skill he's ever tried has worked for him.  Ask him how many different coping skills he uses on a given day.  Then remind him that you have a chemical imbalance going on aka post pardum,  that is a fluctuation of hormones.  Hormones don't care if you practice meditation or exercise or deep breathing.

AskReddit,ev919s9,t3_cihunq,1564300759.0,"Early 1980s, rural Iowa about midnight.  I was in the backseat with mom and grandma.  Dad was driving, grandpa in shootgun.  Grandpa shouts ""Watch it!"" And dad swerved to miss this massive cow.  We went about a tenth of a mile when we see oncoming lights.  Dad starts blinking brights anything to slow the oncoming car.  This MG goes flying past and grandpa tells dad to turn around.  We got back to where we had swerved, cow was injured in the westbound ditch, the MG (what was left of it) upside down in the eastbound ditch.
Dad and grandpa got the flashlights from the car and sent all of us to the closest place to call 911.  I still remember that bike bar and the red neon.  So a biker follow us to the wreck, goes to the cow, manhandles the head it to see the ear tag, gets on his bike and roars off.  
At this point it starts getting chaotic.  Dad and grandpa are yelling for the guy to wait for the ambulance but he crawls out of the ditch.  Biker returns, truck behind him and a big backhoe with its flood lights on.  Sheriff speeds up lights going, ambulance finally gets there along with a few other cars.  I remember being fascinated with the backhoe as it went straight to the cow.  This big person gets out with a shotgun and 2 rounds go off.  Something was thrown over the hoe before it scooped the now dead cow up.  The guy is sitting on the gurney, men are directing traffic like it was the middle of the day, and the person that scooped up the cow was butchering it right there.  
I think i must have gotten tired and fallen asleep at some point but I do remember dad getting back in the car with a big armload of white butcher paper wrapped cow."
