CPTSD,fowr76n,t1_fown56k,1588125424.0,"Thanks for reaching out. That you are a survivor is important of a distinction to people, and generally, it simply really is. Thanks so much for clarifying. I removed a bunch of stuff, but because in that case it spun out of your first comment, and was then really at heart arguing, no matter how kindly and well written. But despite removing like 6 comments or something somehow I never considered anything more, even a few day temp ban. Your just clearly a kind person who means this entirely in good faith. And your desire to work within the rules is another sign of that, and appreciated. I can see how frustrating it would be to be a survivor, have something to share in a sincere desire to help, to find that help is largely called inappropriate. I get how tough that would be, and am sorry for it. And to answer your question, yes, that would largely do it, so long as you made it super clear, perhaps phrasing it different ways and repeating this point in longer comments, that you are speaking purely from your own lived experience, that would  be acceptable, your decency and kindness, phrasing, all were fine otherwise. 

I will be honest, these comments may well remain unpopular in this community, and there is little I can do about downvotes. But if their clearly and overtly framed as your own personal experience, leaving people to find value within that, that is entirely within the rules, popular or not, and it does seem entirely likely a minority of people could get a bunch from this in this community. I will say it just because I had not heard of it in years. But I personally had a roommate for 5 years, and close friend for 10 years, who got an enormous amount from ""A course in miracles"". 

We moved due to practical concerns, he had various serious physical concerns and I was heavily involved in mental health recovery by then, and the sheer distance ended the relationship in time, with us losing touch after several years. But I had never heard of this course in miracles before or since, and just how much it helped him is something I remember. I do think a real minority of survivors can get something from this. Your a kind person, and your general framing excellent. So yes, just make it real clear your speaking from your own personal experience, and its not a rule 1 issue at all. Religious or highly spiritual people are welcome here, as are all survivors, as are you, very much so. I really hope this makes sense. And I really do hope you feel welcome here overall, just very much so."
CPTSD,fowoawr,t3_g8tav4,1588123759.0,"Hey, I am a moderator. This is entirely appropriate of course, and I am not removing anything. This is very relatable, its important, I do understand it so much. The only issue is a small heads up for future. that rule 4, trigger warnings in the title, are quite important overall. Not a huge deal individually, just a reminder. I really hope this makes sense."
CPTSD,fownsgb,t1_fot5reg,1588123466.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. ""you really think the whole world is out to get you"" is a clear cut rule 1 issue. If you check under rule 1 there is a link called ""more info"" that can explain in detail. But essentially we're a person centered support community for complex trauma survivors, most of whom are child abuse survivors. Empathy, compassion, relatedness and respect are key ideas here. This is just way too confrontational. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fown9tf,t1_fouv5wq,1588123162.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. Telling people in a community specifically for complex trauma, the vast majority of whom are child abuse survivors in a community to support each other through that specifically 'take things less seriously"" is obvious nonsense. Child abuse is in fact a serious matter, and the people in therapeutic recovery for it are going through serious things, clearly. The fact you do not take it seriously speaks more to you than anything. That is what makes such nonsense not true, the downvotes are not why, their a symptom of why. Also this is as much as possible a safe space for trauma survivors. So well it is true ""you can't control what other people joke about"" in the real world, in this place that is my and the other mods job, and we totally can control it here. In the end I do not know why your here if your not a survivor in recovery. This appears basic low level trolling. The next step is a temp ban, I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fowlsgt,t1_fosukf1,1588122296.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. I get this is an attempt to be kind or loving. But telling people to open their heart to God as an explicit statement is not allowed here, its a rule 1 issue, This actually does not require me to parse if this is actually caring or more about you, which is complex, and frankly hard for me to say. Issue is more that we would do this about any absolute blanket statement, ""just do X"". That would be true if it was  telling people as an absolute statement to use a particular therapy type, and is true in regards to to absolute attempts at conversion to theism or deism, or really anything. 

Like in many such cases you truly appear caring and sincere to me. But this is a support community for complex post traumatic stress survivors, the vast majority child abuse survivors. To put it into perspective I would assume you are not walking into real world local therapy groups for child abuse survivors, and telling them to open their heart to God,  well not even identifying as a survivor yourself. I assume you are not, and really hope not. This no different whatsoever. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fowk28a,t1_fovxy4g,1588121309.0,"Hello, I am a moderator and have to remove this. There is no getting past it, this wildly past the point of reason. In this same thread you have another comment telling someone you hope they get raped until they die. I believe its the single worst comment I have seen here in 16 months as mod, I am removing both comments, and will have to ban you. For transparency;s sake its rule 1 at issue first and foremost. Seeking help for the underlying rage here seems wise. It honestly really does, I do not know what else to say."
CPTSD,fowjhiz,t3_g8qxxb,1588120989.0,"Hey, I am a moderator. This is not a huge deal in and of itself overall, and this is entirely appropriate of a topic, I am certainly not removing anything. But I just needed to give a general heads up about the importance of trigger warnings. Its rule 4. Not  huge deal overall. But I did need to mention it. The point of this post is so important, I had similar experiences, and do think it is effectively CSA in practice regardless of intent. We were children, how the victim takes it matters much more than nebulous concepts of intent, which child abusers are incapable of fully sorting through anyway. The damage to the child and adult they become seems key. I am sorry it happened to you and all of us. But the trigger warning in the title in future is vital. I really hope this makes sense."
CPTSD,fowiq7f,t1_foo97q6,1588120563.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. Its just too confrontational, and a clear rule 1 issue. I get it, your concern for womans actual experience in receiving medical care is easy to see. But empathy, compassion, relatedness and respect are key ideas here, this is an inherently person centered place. I do get your point, but such arguments are often triggering to other survivors. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmzh13r,t3_fydwjb,1586520112.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. I just don't know what to say. The anger is clearly and without question valid when speaking of abusers. But this is direct threats to others, and just not allowed. Its just so clear and overt. Its pretty big in truth, this is unsafe for me to leave up, its so triggering to other survivors. And in truth this is past a threat of self harm, which Reddit has never shown to care about, or a threat towards a single unnamed individual, which they appear to take on a case by case basis based upon how realistic it seems. But this, this is so specific. Its a list of actual people in the real world. Its mentioning a specific plan that won't work for you, with a clear openness to finding another method. It gives an attempt at an ethical defense. Ans it mentions suicide as an end game to all of this stuff. Honestly, I get the anger, but what your doing is dangerous. Not the plan, the plan is wrong on so many levels so completely its hard to overemphasize. Not the plan, coming on here and saying all of this, by itself, is dangerous to you. 

I really, truly hope you do not mean it. But if you do I really have to say this is wrong, and your life matters too much for this, if you hurt people and do not have the nerve to kill yourself, a common occurrence since people can be reduced to the other a lot easier than people can override their ever survival instinct, then its life in a cage, and as hated as only a few other types from within that cage. Its not worth it at all. And if your just incredibly, immensely angry and would not do it, then this is just dangerous for you. Reddit cares about little else. People vent horrible crimes on some subs, and show pictures of themselves doing hard drugs, and all sorts of foolishness, normally Reddit waits for a warrant from law enforcement. 

They like that we feel anonymous on here, which Redditors like generally. But its not actual anonymity, its called pseudo anonymity. Reddit is fully capable of finding your IP address. And in these two cases, potential spree killing and terrorism, Reddit contacts the FBI themselves. Its both rare enough it does not really affect Reddit's business model to do so, and seems extreme enough its got the Reddit leadership, normally vaguely Libertatian but less so every day, to be willing to stop it without some debate about the validity of that. Its happened too many times, its too real. 

Please don't do anything, its really so utterly not worth it at any level, as much rage as you feel you must know you would feel bad afterword, and your bound to, because you would with CPTSD or most any mental health issue almost without exception, and if you were a psychopath, the rare exception, you would not feel a desire to make loud and dangerous threats, you would have simply acted. You will feel horrible if you hurt anyone, at heart you know you will unless its an absolutely pure abuser, and even then you likely feel bad, and its so easy for others to get caught up in this and hurt as well, no matter what your list says. You really will almost certainly feel bad. And good chance even if you can find it in you to hurt others you can't do so to actually kill yourself. Then its forever in an indescribable hell for life. 

And if this is rage its just very foolish. Deleting it yourself will help if the FBI come no doubt, it affects how intent is viewed, and them coming is not a tiny possibility. If they do not by chance take it as a blessing, and seek help. You are worth it and deserve it. Consider walking to a hospital, Covid or not they will admit on this basis almost certainly. Psych wards are awful, but their a hell of a lot better than the road your heading down right now. Please reconsider. In any case I do have to remove this. Overt threats against others violate several rules here in various ways. But a specific one in this type of case is unneeded, because this violates Reddit's site wide rules. I just really hope you can be okay, remain safe for yourself and others, and find the help you need and deserve, just very much so, and really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmynp1j,t1_fmyd4g6,1586490674.0,"Thanks so much for explaining. I had not heard of the pink pill. I am an ally of non TERF radical feminism in the Dworkin mild myself personally. The immediate idea I take when I hear pink pill is the old non TERF rad fem idea of a hoped for matriarchy, or female supremacy. Not a criticism, as an emotional point, in order to make a point in terms activism, as a highly theoretical matter, its not an idea I find at all offensive, indeed quite the opposite. But this is not the space for it. It is not considered toxic I should say, it may well be the more common of the more intense minority views here. Its not toxic, its just too overtly political. We're really a pure support community for trauma survivors and nothing but, empathy, compassion, relatedness and respect. We're particularly compassion based and person centered here as compared to similar communities, that emphasis on empathy and a pure support role is somewhat uniquely strong of an idea here. So politics unless its very minor and secondary to sharing ones own lived experience, is just not a thing we encourage in this community. 

Really its almost entirely people telling about their current lives or earlier life trauma, asking for empathy, helping others, and such. We don't actually discourage advice, but we're so specifically compassion and empathy based we do generally ask the OP's, those actually posting threads rather than just commenting, are expected to ask for advice or feedback if they want it, otherwise we generally ask people to assume the OP only wants empathy. This is a very caring place. But it is, unless tougher feedback is actually requested, that way because we do not allow much debate or critique at all broadly speaking. I did create a community for the intersection of trauma and politics for survivors to have a more free speech zone. 

A pure free speech zone is impossible well remaining a support community, and in practice the decades on the internet has taught me absolutist free speech ideals are largely undesirable, and do not bring out good ideas or good people more often. A bitter pill for adolescent me, but absolutely true when its purist free speech in the vast bulk of instances. But outside extreme far right, essentially Nazi stuff, and TERF concepts, it is as much a free speech zone about things related to trauma and healing as is possible for survivors well  remaining a support environment. With the pink pill stuff I do not know your feelings on trans people, I know some analogous seeming rad fem ideas were not supportive of trans people. Still, we accept all survivors, in that case just avoiding the topic is best. 

But I did want to invite you to r/TraumaAndPolitics, it seems like it may be helpful to you. Or perhaps its not interesting at all. that is entirely understandable as well. But it is a pretty open place within pretty wide parameters, from Andrea Dworkin to Jordan Peterson are allowed, which their really not here, as the two far sides of what is allowed there. Just an idea. Anyway sorry to go on. I have autism I am on government disability for, and a long talker generally. But also I find your views interesting personally, want you to know I do not find the basic idea toxic, its radical which I am down with overall, its only that its too political and too likely to start arguments in this pure support space, as much as possible a safe space, for survivors. 

I do find them interesting personally though, and wanted to mention a community where such ideas are allowed, not unwelcome, and may fit in better than here. I should say its a new community, 160+ in a few months, and growing by 1 or 2 almost every day. As I say though its just an idea. I do hope you know your welcome here within that pure support community concept though, very much so. So long as they stick to feelings, lived experience, and trauma so are the MRA's I should say, and I happen to know we have a few quiet ones who do not bother others with that specific topic, and manage to fit in fine. More have disliked the generally pro feminist views here, which are common and essentially baked into trauma support communities as a thing. 

But some manage to set those ideas aside so they can give and receive support as trauma survivors specifically, and fit in fine if they can really internalize that. Also anarchists, people who would openly murder every pedophile, Libertarians, hardcore socialists, anti psychiatry activists, and all manner of unique ideas. Your views may be unusual here, but the fact of having unique ideas on all sides of the political spectrum, and views that are simply so unique they fall into their own category, is not at all rare here. So I did want to make that you are very welcome overall in this community overall completely. Sorry again for the length of this. And thank you so much for being so reasonable and understanding. Its just really great, and I just hope your day can be a great one. :)"
CPTSD,fmycz8q,t1_fmv88qz,1586483291.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. The idea that this is a ""female dating and level up sub"" is fundamentally silly. This is a pure support community for PTSD, and abuse and trauma survivors generally. That is common in every race, class, gender, and everything else. Indeed we have proportionally normal number of survivors of all ages, backgrounds, genders, and such as society overall, excepting that younger and more tech oriented people are broadly speaking more represented, as is true across Reddit. If your a survivor and lashing out as an emotional flashback that is understandable, but this lashing out and making weird, vaguely MRA nonsense is still not acceptable, even if its based from trauma. And if your not a survivor then this is some basic ass trollery. I mean its a community of trauma survivors, if anyone was truly triggered you would have gotten responses back telling you off, and heavily downvoted. 

Yet nothing like that, just sits lonesome at 0 upvotes for 20 hours. I mean I am not yet considering a temp ban yet, because I cannot be sure what this is. If your a survivor and triggered and criticizing its highly ineffective, and if your trolling your terrible at it. Sorry, I should be more empathetic, but you give me no detail to work on when trying to see this from your perspective, and I find people cluttering up my mod queue with such what seems very much like the most basic sort of anti feminist gibberish. I wish I had seen this sooner, that is my only concern here. 

But please stop, I hate banning and rarely need to, and to push it there over such silliness seems just so pointless. I just wanted to give you a chance here, because normally this will be removed far sooner than this was today, because rarely is everyone busy for an extended period of time, its only by chance there was not ideal supervision of the community. We move slowly here unless its extreme cruelty or racial slurs and such, we want to be inclusive of survivors with more serious issues, but this is moving towards a temp, and then on from there if sadly needed. No real mods being here was today, and really quite abnormal. People who lash out on the internet randomly are often trauma survivors in the end, and I would hate to see you close off a resource over such fundamentally silly crap. But nothing like this is acceptable here, I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmxkz5p,t3_fxp7yl,1586466947.0,"We, I, must take the juice from each day. For it provides nourishment, no matter how bitter. Ferdinand Foche was the only truly great General France produced during the First World War. He was eventually risen to the rank of Field Martial. But in 1915 at the second Battle of the Marne he was still a two star Major General. During that battle he was supposed to have sent a dispatch to the French high command. It said ""My left flank has collapsed. My center is yielding. The enemy is in my rear. Situation excellent. I am attacking"". There was an activist once, an indigenous lady in Australia who was an activist and educator, named Lilla Watson. She said ""If you are here to teach me your wasting your time. If your here because your liberation is bound up with mine, let us work together"". Lincoln once said ""I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live by what light that I have. I must stand with any man who stands right, stand with him well he is right, and part with him when he goes wrong"".

CPTSD,fmv2me5,t1_fmsvu44,1586404536.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. As I said before, your reply was extremely kind and clearly trying to speak to our common humanity. But it also contained racially insensitive stuff, clearly. Continuing to argue the point with others is a clear rule 1 issue. Kindly desire for us to find commonality is one thing, trying to pretend the world or anyone in it is so high above such concerns that the things we say cannot be racially insensitive is quite another. Its silly, clearly race is a thing, and clearly some people have gotten screwed in that arrangement, social construct or not, and terms like ""mental prison"" do not change that. I really can see your at heart a kindly person who feels they are past such things and wants people to come together and such. But survivors here, people in the world, still have to deal with race and racism day in and day out. I get your a nice person who does not completely understand that, or agree, or whatever. 

But just not getting into talk of race really at all seems wisest. This is a pure support forum for PTSD, this is just too confrontational for this space. Your very much welcome here as a survivor, but I do not think your views on race will fit in here, and taking a step back on that issue in this community is likely best. Talk about anything else, you have always been kind, and I hope people have been kind to you. But your ideas about race are just going to get you into arguments, get downvoted, and end up in my mod queue. That is just the facts here. I just really hope you understand."

I do not know what I think about the universe, or God, or whatever sending people at the right time. But I do know its been as you say 3 months, and yet today is the day I posted about the therapist being done with me, firing me after 1 more session. I am a good person and worked really hard, and we made real progress. But the severity is just too much for her at this point, she feels we have not been connecting since around the time you and I spoke coincidentally, around mid January according to her, and she just doesn't feel competent anymore. It was my first therapy really ever, 150 sessions in 2 and a half years. 

I told her initially that I was far more damaged than I gave off externally, that my greatest fear of the process was abandonment. She spent a solid year building trust in the process, assuring me she would see it coming and work with me and we would prevent it, that it ending with abandonment, tears, and recrimination would not happen, she was quite sure. But its 15-18 months since we finished that attachment and alliance building work, and she is just done at this point. I am trying very hard to see what I did wrong here. 

I don't want to blame her, in truth she gave me 120 out of 150 of those sessions at sliding scale that was essentially pro bono work due to my poverty, its hard to say she did not try hard enough for me. But it happened so rapidly and unilaterally and coldly. I am processing, trying to grieve it, though its very hard right now. But I notice this a lot. Your such a wonderful person. But the timing, its noticeable. I am hurting so much today, and just posted about this today. And here you come with this incredibly kind, valuable, so helpful message about a thread months old, today, just at the point I could really use such kindness. 

I am not prone to saying the universe or whatever sent people or things. But this is amazing in truth. It means an absolutely enormous amount to me, your such a wonderful person. I have thought about this thread a bunch of times myself, it really meant so much to me then, and does now. I don't have proper words to thank you enough.

CPTSD,fmuwzwy,t1_fmsrr1q,1586400771.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. This is a pure support community for PTSD. If you check under rule 1 there is a link called ""more info"" it can explain in more detail. But one of first things in the much lengthier explanation is ""don't be needlessly confrontational, antagonistic, or argumentative. This is not a good space for debates, crusades, or vendettas"".All this ""just work the program"", ""you just want a softer, easier way"" stuff, calling people names, ie: a drunk, stating their not legitimately sober, and minimizing another persons entire response to ""your BS"", none of that is even close to allowed here. This is much as possible a person centered, pure support forum for PTSD, it is not AA, and this level of confrontation is quite specifically against the rules. I really hope you understand."
TalkTherapy,fmuvjy9,t1_fmud7pe,1586399841.0,"This is really just so kind of you. It really means a lot to me. I very much wish I knew when we stopped connecting. She just never explained, she said in February she had not been connecting since January but had re-gained her center, but nothing else she said besides or since then. The group idea is really a great one. I agree with you so much about scarcity and access, I do wish more was available. I just wish she had not told me things. I said this would happen at such length, was so clear that abandonment was my biggest fear about therapy. 

She spent a solid year getting me to trust her, assuring me she was a professional and she would see that coming and know how to handle it, that she would not allow it to happen, and such. And when she ended it was about money purely and solely, until I figured I could come up with the money. Then she was leaving town, until I explained I could get transport to the city nearby she was easily enough. Then it was I had to guarantee sobriety, and when I did that it was only then that we had not been connecting since January, and she did not feel competent, and such. 

I feel hurt and used. I feel like she wanted to work with me to prove she was charitable, and could work with a severe trauma case, and such, and when it got less interesting and sshe figured she had proven enough to herself about being charitable it was suddenly the best thing to throw me aside. But fundamentally I must be at fault for that. In the end it does no good to look outward, so looking at what I am doing wrong seems needed. Yet everything I can figure is deeply part of my personality. 

I am not sure what I could have done differently, I was certainly inward looking, and I was certainly committed to the process. That was her big thing for a long time, that I should trust the process. I did do so, and knowing I am so messed up it made no difference to how this turned out, its hard in truth. I wish I had some idea. It hurts an enormous amount to be honest. Your kind words do help a great deal though. I hope so much you are well, and I hope your people are well. I hope you are okay, good, and safe during this current crisis. And I hope so much your day can be such a beautiful one, as you so clearly are worth and deserve, just so very much so. :)"
CPTSD,fmtmxcb,t1_fmtfnxx,1586375486.0,"This really mean so much to me. I can relate to this a lot in truth. My therapist is not an intern. But in truth her original Masters is in something highly artistic, and her degree as a therapist is something this province allowed due to the doctor shortage overall, which is below a Masters and above a Bachelors degree. And she had only been doing it for 2 years when we met, as a second career for her in early middle age. I think she wanted to be a trauma focused therapist a lot more than she was qualified for, and was barely trauma informed in truth. 

It breaks my heart, because she tried to much for me. This was my first therapy ever really, besides one attempt at 10 sessions of CBT I found hurtful and others reflected was abusive 12 years ago, ever. 2 and a half years and 150 sessions, it took forever for her to get me to trust her, and now this. The fact is I could have got what I got out of this therapy with 6 months and 25 sessions of DBT informed therapy. That is the vast bulk of what she gave me, the ability to emotionally regulate, and that was not really a serious problem before in truth. But it was a minor issue, and I will give her credit at helping me solve it. And 1 of the 17 big T traumas from childhood specifically, she did help me solve that early in therapy. I do not have quite the experience you do. 

But I can relate I think, I was in a facility for 6 months as a small child that was abusive and was shut down 10 years after I was there, and I am in a class action lawsuit now 30 years later. And in or near adulthood I was in a psych ward 3 times, one for a major suicide attempt. I just look so quiet and reasonable, and am so inward looking, and kind and loving, it sends them for a loop when they realize how deep the CPTSD goes, and how real the autism is. I mask and compartmentalize really quite well, and they often do not realize initially, or for a while, how severe it is. I am so hurt. It feels like she just thought she was more qualified then she was, now she hates admitting that, and wants to focus on how much she did to help me as a practical matter. 

I feel hurt and messed up from this. The new therapist does sound solid. She is EMDR, all I know besides that is she is supposedly super kindly, but also lived into adulthood in Soviet communism so unlikely to get sucked into my bullshit, and with decades of experience. And with an agency, which I am quite frightened of in one sense due to my history of institutional abuse, but also know an agency is less likely to allow this to spin off the rails like this one went. My current counselor through that agency, for my drinking problem, 18 months sobriety, specifically, he says she is the only person in that agency who he thinks can give me real therapy. 

He himself, the addiction counselor, is awesome. But I wore him down, its all supportive with him now. He is competent enough he thinks she can help, that she is kindly enough I won't bounce, but skilled enough I can get real benefit. That sounds hopeful to me in truth. But fuck this hurts. I  get it, I do. I read a stupid amount of literature on the transference and counter-transference before beginning therapy, Winnicot and attachment theory and all that, I came in eyes open. But it hurts. I told her, I told her from day 1. I am fundamentally know different now from then, and I told her the issues. She swore she had it, she was the professional, and such. 

I will do the new lady. I will keep moving forward, as a worker I trust as far as he is capable, and he honest as to the limits of that capability, says just a today a bit ago. I will keep moving forward. But it is very hard right now. Your kind words and hopefulness help enormously. It wouldn't have 2 years ago, a 50/50 chance I did not take this as empathetic enough and though I would not respond out of the rules I gold so dear I would have taken badly, that I take this and absorb its kindness is something that therapist helped give me I guess. I wish she had not lead me on and fucked with my emotions like that. But she helped with the emotional regulation like crazy. 

Not its outward expression, I was always good at following the rules and customs of society, but the internal stuff. I can take the care now, and good chance I get all pissy and offended 2 years ago. That is not nothing,  I can take empathy as real at a deeper level almost always now. Maybe that was worth 2 and a half years, though I still think she got in over her head and strung me along in a way I am hurt badly by. I am sorry, trying to process I guess. Its just tough. Your words and kindness, knowing someone can relate, it means a lot to me though. Really a ton. I hope so much you are well, and your people good. I hope things are okay with the current pandemic/crisis, and your okay and safe. And I hope your day is such a beautiful one, so much so, as you so very clearly deserve. :)"
CPTSD,fmtdj58,t1_fmsymp5,1586370908.0,"This is really so kind of you, and helps a lot to hear. Its hopeful, and it just makes it easier to think of going forward. The agency I deal with is able to find me a therapist in time. It would be quicker if not for the pandemic, but that is nobody's fault. She is actually EMDR specifically, which I am hopeful for. But whenever my person can set it up its likely to be supportive therapy until the current severe restrictions are lifted, which of course are months off and entirely up in the air. She, the new therapist, will likely be able to so supportive therapy until the current most serious part of the crisis is over though, and then do EMDR with me after that. I am very hopeful. In respect to the issues that are fundamental to me I mentioned, the counselor setting up therapy seems convinced this therapist can handle me, and is the only person in the agency, amongst woman anyway as I am unwilling to deal with the CSA and childhood stuff with a man, who can handle me. 

So I am hopeful, yet worried, if she decides I am too far gone its a whole other agency I will need to deal with, and I have no idea how many therapists that agency may have who can deal with more severe clients, and that other agency is it in this town. I just worry. But this lady is supposedly great, highly experienced for decades, kind as heck so I will not run, but grew up into adulthood in Eastern European communism, so I am unlikely to steamroll her into just validating me. That is really hopeful, someone kindly who can push against my bullshit at the same time. I am really trying to think optimistically. But it is hard. I feel so hurt and abandoned by the current therapist. 

I feel like she bit off more than she could chew. I was super, incredibly clear about how severe I was, how I feared abandonment more than anything. She swore up and down she was a professional and would see that coming, and that would not happen. Now its happening, and it hurts a lot. But I am trying to remain hopeful. Your kind words mean an enormous amount to me. I cannot thank you enough. Your a really nice person. Knowing things can work out helps a great deal. I hope so much you are well and your people are well. I hope things are great, as you very much deserve. And I hope your day can be such a beautiful one, just very much so. :)"
CPTSD,fmtbai7,t1_fmsup05,1586369859.0,"Hey, I am moderator, and have to remove this. I don't know what to say. There is a quite large paragraph here, and the vast majority of it is kindness, and speaking of our common humanity. Its empathetic of the OP, and ought to be entirely acceptable. But then the points about how all peoples have committed atrocities. Well true its just too confrontational for this place. Its not a point that needs be brought up in a pure support forum for PTSD. As pointed out, the OP simply wanted empathy regarding their ancestral trauma. 

Overall I do not believe this is an inappropriate comment most places, but in this pure support community for PTSD it is I am afraid. I can see this is literally 2 or 3 sentences sandwiched in a quite lengthy paragraph of empathy and concern for the OP, and people generally. But getting into the crimes or atrocities of whole groups is just too confrontational overall. You have gone about it as kind as I ever saw, but its still just too confrontational of an discussion. We're really quite purely a support community. I just hope this explains it, and really hope you understand."

But unless people ask for advice or feedback this is purely a support forum for trauma survivors. Empathy, compassion, relatedness, and respect. Emphasizing forgiveness for abusers is really best only for those who have expressed openness to that already. This just does not talk about empathy for the OP's abuse at all, its all about forgiveness. If it happened to be well taken by the OP I would leave it, but once its reported its an issue. You were compassionate in a real way of course. But its more about taking the other person where they are. I really hope you understand."

This was quite specific to the government of China rather than the people, or culture, and such. But people do find emphasizing national blame is hurtful to other survivors, or triggering. We just can't be having any real depth discussion about that, in the end we're a pure support community for PTSD, sticking to your own lived experience is best overall. The issue is this is just not a political discussion space at all. 

I actually created a second sub, its small and newish but growing, for this discussion in particular, called r/TraumaAndPolitics. This clearly made a point of not attacking Chinese people generally. But then its about politics, the government of China, and that is just not allowed here. I am trying to remain more inclusive where rule violations are not clear cut. But this space is just not designed for these discussions, and it may explain a large part of the downvotes, though part of that is that people find the concept of national blame to be hurtful or triggering.

As much as I can find out it looks valid, as much as one considers Fordham University, which is one of the largest Catholic universities in New York State, and is a well established research university, is considered valid by the survivor individually. So far as I know, they accept federal funding and obey US federal law. Past that I can say nothing, survivors have to use their own best judgment about whether to participate.

CPTSD,fmssurp,t1_fmrg0l5,1586361464.0,"Hey, I am a moderator. I have decided not to remove this, because its a common sentiment here, and more that that its clearly trying to be inclusive of the entire community. The issue is emphasizing how we're minimizing others pain as valid is triggering to other survivors. And the fact is there are a lot of survivors here who are finding social isolation and distancing quite difficult. Its so clearly not attacking this community, so clearly trying to be inclusive, I am not removing it. I hate being tough, but I have to say this is the line though. Empathy, compassion, relatedness, and respect are key here. I get that its a common vibe here that the crisis measures currently in place are no big deal, and to understandably want to relate with each other about how others can finally see how many trauma survivors live and feel. 

But even though you worked really hard to avoid it, it is minimizing to the large minority of other survivors here who are affected negatively by the current crisis, and its restrictions. Its just a reminder to remain mindful of everyone in the community, because parts of this were stated in quite a tough way, not that your overall sentiment are wrong as a feeling, whatsoever. I am sorry about the need for this reminder, its as much about leaving a message publicly for the whole community about this issue as anything, and really hope you understand."

But they do have a fair bit of quit distinct lingo. Nothing wrong with that of course. But RBN is just so much bigger than us, or anyone. We're a clear number 2 in terms of numbers, and RBN is like 8 times our size, its entirely possible their as big as every other trauma support community combined. That is also valid, but our culture here has done an enormous amount of good for survivors as well, and its just so easy for our culture to be overwhelmed by RBN's if we let it. I hate nagging when people are trying to share or be helpful, which this clearly was. But that is why I have to just give a reminder pretty much every time.

CPTSD,fmr6pu1,t3_fwsequ,1586315167.0,"Hello, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. I can see very much your only trying to be helpful. But its a rule 7 issue regarding self promotion. We do allow large studies done by well known universities, but even in those cases they ask the moderators, and have to put ""Mod Approved"" in the title, after waiting to receive that approval. But quite frankly that is based on the institution their speaking for being big enough I personally cannot imagine telling them no. That is really the only standard I can use, when Stanford or whatever calls I feel its faintly ridiculous for me to tell them no. Because this is fundamentally peer support I have no other real way of judging except by names of institutions that would seem obvious to most people. Such places are notable for always asking for permission. But outside that its self promotion in the end, it has to be, besides the obvious institutions I cannot know what is a legitimate study or whatever, and what is not. We do allow this sort of stuff though, in the name of not silencing survivors. 

This sort of thing is allowed in the Weekly Vents and Victories thread. The issue here is the same one as with links to blogs and books and such, if we allowed it there is actually a fair number of survivors involved in the creation of such things, they can be more unusual, which though valid tends to start arguments, and in the end there is enough of it it can too easily clutter what is at its core a pure support forum for PTSD, for survivors to relate and share with each other and such. I really get the good and kind motivation here, and this is very welcome in the Vents and Victories thread. But its a rule 7 issue otherwise, I really hope you understand."

Its been quite popular, and I do not want to invalidate the community by removing it. But in future speaking from your own lived experience more and less as an objective fact would be valuable. 

Its not that its not true, or that it is, I simply don't know. None of us are confirmed to be psychiatrists or anything, its getting too divisive in the larger community, starting arguments, and such. This is a great thing and kind of you, I am really happy you and others have got such help from it. But the discussion has done all the good it can I think.

But someone clicking this post may start thinking its about gaslighting generally, and the subject of unwanted sexual advances comes up. Individually such forgetting is not a big deal at all, and does happen regularly. But its why I have to remind everyone unfortunately, so a lack of trigger warnings does not become a big thing. The thing is this is a place for survivors to have a real voice, and can speak on any sort of trauma if they want or need to. I feel bad nagging on this when people are sharing. This is not the most triggering thing I ever saw by any means at all.

You sounded like someone excitedly shouting about what helped them, there was nothing offensive there whatsoever. I am literally a mod, if someone was bothered by it it absolutely would have been reported, and it wasn't at all. And thank you so much for the recommendation, its really great. There are a lot of books that have helped survivors, but in particular Van Der Kolk and Pete Walker's books seem to have done an unusual amount of good here, or generally speaking. We recommend Pete Walkers book on the sidebar only because we do not recommend any books usually, but that one recommendation was here when the sub was created by the original founding mod. But in real ways there are two large recommendations rather than one, because the community has as a group gotten so much from Bessel Van Der Kolk's book as well. 

I get more from the relational aspect personally, therapy and groups and contributing here, I keep meaning to read books on the topic and never do. I have read a lot of the scientific and academic literature about trauma and therapy, but not books themselves so much. But when and if I do its those two books without question, the amount survivors here have been helped by them cannot be overstated. And yeah. Personally I cannot help but agree with you enormously, trauma recovery is just crazy at times, just super friggin messed up. Worthwhile, valuable, helpful, healing, and such.

CPTSD,fmnofl6,t1_fmncmds,1586230959.0,"This is just extraordinarily interesting and nuanced stuff. I do see what you mean completely. I was nearly 40 before taking the position they were at fault for a reason. My own father was a lifelong criminal and drug addict, a full blown heroin addict by 15 who had 5 years in various jails by the time he had me at 22, I was 22 myself and he recently turned 45 when I found him passed from an overdose. He met my mother in a psych ward, the facility itself was split between a psych ward and a rehab and she was a 17 year old patient in the former, well he was a client in the latter. The allowed them outdoors to smoke, and mingle with little oversight, and ran off together. Technically ke kidnapped her as he was taking a minor from a psychiatric hospital,  but he took her across the country and married her, which got rid of such potential charges back then. 

My mother came from abuse, her father was literally the pissing himself, well known town drunk of a pretty small town, until the system took her at 11, she spent 11 to 17 in various foster homes, group homes, and psych facilities in the 70's, where the most hideous sort of abuses occurred. I did not blame them for many years. And if they were not in the western world I may not now, they were very poor, from a horrible background. My own father spanked and hit us far more severely and frequently than is even close to legal now because he himself was beat with sticks and chords, with hospitalization being a thing, and spanking being normal enough then he was on the tough end of both legal and normal with us kids back then. 

He was neglectful because he was a heroin addict, and had been since childhood, and saw no way out. My mother was cruel and verbally abusive, or swinging to attempts to be a perfect mother, or hiding in her bed for days and weeks, because she was a depressed battered woman with severe untreated mental health disorders. My father did not realize he was abusive towards her, he loved her so much as he could, he had spent his childhood around men who tortured their wives and controlled them like wooden dolls, that was what he thought abuse was, he thought his abuse was the culmination of relatively rare arguments. 

My parents did not seek out either DV shelters or rehab again because that was really tough and pushy back then. And they did not want to put as into the system and foster care because of my mothers own experience of abuse in that system. The issue for me is that 'just do nothing and keep abusing children' cannot be a valid option. They knew, I saw them in distress searching for answers knowing they were abusive, just then denying it with excuses after just having acknowledged it. Little pitchers have big ears and all that, but I saw it, and more than once. The system was hard back then, scary. It really was. 

But it existed, those rehabs and DV shelters existed. Not once, not once in us kids childhood did they try. Not therapy, not parenting books, not classes, not nothing. I mean I do get the justifications. My father literally had an eighth grade education, and my mother tenth, with me at 17, and 3 kids at 21. My father had us on welfare half the time, but though he worked some of the time and made decent money in factories, foundries, truck driving, and construction all that money went to heroin, because he figured we lived on welfare half the time anyway, and he always made sure our basic needs were met within that poverty. And in terms of his criminality he was literally raised that way from childhood, and was a gun toting criminal by 15. 

He gave all that up for us kids, all big drug dealing or violence.gangs entirely, stuck to growing grass and selling a few pills here and there to friends, and check/fraud scams. It was all he knew, and he thought he was doing good in truth. But its gotta stop somewhere. The fact he did not think of it as a real possibility does not change that rehab and becoming a decent citizen was possible. Indeed easier for him than others, he always kept a car on the road, and he had real skills he could use to make a living. He didn't even try, not once once us kids were born. And my mother could have gotten into a DV shelter. Sure, she was afraid. 

Every woman in a DV shelter is afraid, the fact her kids were afraid has to mean something. If they had really pushed they almost certainly could have split us kids between more functional, non abusive relations. Nobody had enough they could take 3 kids, but they could have spread us around and kept up contact. Honestly, people only get so much lower born in the western world than my parents. There were resources there though, tough or not they existed. Literally just like us survivors navigating the system it seems to me, which is no friggin treat, as I am sure you are aware. Now I did fuck up and make a complete and utter wreck of my life before therapy and recovery when I was 36, 3 years ago. 

Just an utter shitshow. Yet I was never abusive, and nobody ever once said I was. I like to believe I would have got help if anyone had. But I do get how it can happen between trauma survivors, often its co-abusive and simply toxic, and such relationships are common amongst survivors. Being a recluse was my main difference there likely. But that is adults. I can understand how people get into shitty relationships and not realize their abusive, especially in the span of months, or even a couple years. But not children. Not over the course of a whole childhood. I am not saying I do not get where it comes from, or empathize in real ways. But I am saying that this is the example of what so many survivors are called unjustly. 

My parents were unmotivated, victim playing, excuse making whiners and cowards as one ever saw. That is literally what it comes down to. You can make my father sound like a literal monster, easily. You can make my mother sound like the craziest, meanest sort of harridan, easily. They had a lot of good and love in them though, and that is very much a real part of them, there was real love in our house. I do believe that getting that help requires support and care. But when abuse is involved, and in particular child abuse, there is I believe more of an ethical and moral duty to do the hard work of recovery, even if the person is not ready internally, or does not have ideal supports. Or find the kids other, decent homes in whatever way is possible. 

The system if needed, and keep involved and get better to prevent abuses and regain custody. With kids I think people have a responsibility to seek help. I do get how they got here, I really do. And I do empathize, and have shed many bitter and sorrowful tears over my parents own abuse as children. But it has to stop somewhere. I could see a circumstance I would get into a relationship and have it turn abusive in principle, its not that hard to imagine with my emotional issues in truth. I can even see it ending and maybe not seeking help, because its horribly hard, though I really believe I would seek help. But I know I would before abusing kids, without question. 

The extent of the abuse, being lowborn, not having supports, none of that can be allowed to be an excuse, not when its kids. That is my feeling on it in truth. I get your idea well though, its very well thought out, and the deep empathy and compassion for everyone involved is so clear. Your a kind person, and your trying to think on this with more nuance and subtlety, which is important. It took me almost 40 years to get here though. But for me empathy can only go so far. It has to stop somewhere, and if we do not hold people responsible, not blame but responsible, for child abuse, and call them what they are even when we sympathize, then nothing changes. I do not think this is a binary though, I think your more nuanced views are entirely valid, and really are so obviously based on compassion and empathy for everyone involved."
Antipsychiatry,fmneyxs,t3_fwaviy,1586224541.0,"Mostly I identify as a consumer survivor, in practice critical psychiatry, but certainly sympathetic to those who are purely anti psychiatry. I am personally not against meds in all cases, in principle. The issue is I think their a huge risk. They absolutely can be and are life saving for some people, but if its a large chance its going to do no good each individual medication, and there is a coin toss with each truly meaningful medication its going to make the situation far, far worse, that doesn't seem like a risk I can take or advocate. And well it can get overblown some of those medications have serious physical side effects, and some are addictive. I have no doubt there is some awesome combination of medication that would put my mind and emotions in much better shape, but I see no safe way of getting that combination. 

I dislike diagnosis a great deal, its a blunt tool at best, and if anything it may be a vaguely useful heuristic for professionals, but its certainly not needed to openly label people. My main issue is actually dealing with the people, and psych care itself. The wards, psych nurses, psychiatrists, lines, and such. Their useless, with not a stitch of evidence base to say their helpful for most people. Really any medical people at all. If I did not need to deal with them it may be different. But since all they have is diagnosis, which is at most a vaguely useful classification system based on educated guesswork, and medication, which could work or could harm you a great deal, 

I just don't see the point, or the risk as worth it. I mostly consider myself a consumer survivor because I cannot guarantee I will never see a medical mental health professional again in my life. I was in an abusive institutions for 6 months as a child, it was eventually shut down for abuse and I am in a class action now 30 years later. As well as 3 admittances for a total of 16 days in or near adulthood. I am a survivor of psychiatric care. And if I need them, in the unlikely even I feel I do, I am a consumer of mental health services. Their like an accountant in the end, or a mechanic, you can find them in the phone book, and quit them just as easily. 

The old consumer/survivor movement is not quite dead, not so long as I and those who remember live on. I cannot go to it now because of the virus, but I attend a mental health drop in center that was built by the old consumer/survivor movement. People may forget or not know, but such drop in centers were built entirely originally by released psych patients under the banner of the consumer/survivor movement 25 to 40 years ago, and were given funding and taken over by the government in time, in the same way domestic violence shelters were with the feminists. I don't know if I am truly anti-psychiatry. But I am highly, highly critical, and if we closed all the psych wards tomorrow I would not shed a tear. 

People have to be left to live their own lives. If their suicidal that is sad, and every possible measure should be offered to help. But mental health prisons are no answer. And with anything besides suicide either the person is committing a crime, or their not. I guess there has to be a few such places, for quite rare types of examples that could be brought up. But mostly their nonsense, and do no good at all, at its best its a stasis and a bubble, and does much harm all the time. I hate hospitals more than anything, and the power over the vulnerable they have, and how they push the pills without any real explanation of just how dangerous they are. But on the far end of critical psychiatry towards anti psychiatry I guess, though deep in my heart and publicly I will always be a consumer/survivor."
CPTSD,fmnc3ty,t3_fwaey4,1586222716.0,"Its really so awful, I am just sorry she is like that. To gaslight you like that, its just so wrong. My own mother is in AA and sober 6 years, I am almost 39, so she technically does admit it now. You know, but it was a result of others abuse of her, and besides which she is a new person. She admits us kids had a ""very rough childhood"", and that is it, I have to grow up and get over it. The sad fact is their child abusers. I am not saying real closure or reconciliation is impossible, them taking ownership and responsibility. But it appears super rare. My own experience actually is not terrible so far as these things go sadly. 

Straight up lying, doubling down and refusing to get into detail in a bald faced way, is extremely common with this. Its just so heartbreaking and wrong. Your not crazy though, at all. Its just how such people are, even like in my case their not good, even when their being good. And often they don't even go that far, and remain shitty forever. I wish so much she was not like this. But this is her stuff, not yours. I am just sorry it happened, and hope you can internalize that what you went through was real and mattered better in time, because it ever much was and is. And I just hope you can feel so much better, very much so."
CPTSD,fmn6yrs,t1_fmn6b1c,1586219508.0,"Sure. I should have said that initially. I am not against other ideas at all. I can't guarantee I will agree, but certainly I would be open to listening for sure."
CPTSD,fmmjpm9,t1_fmmedha,1586206514.0,"They really do. Not getting help is a choice, and each act of abuse or neglect is an adult making a choice. Its barely comprehensible, and infuriating when its against children. But its true, and needs to be acknowledged more. We fall so easily as a society into excuses, because parenting is hard. But its hard on everyone, yet some manage not to abuse children. Thank you so much for sharing, its just so vital people acknowledge it more. Its a tough realization, or was for me anyway, but really important, being able to say it, and hear others say it, is just really great. :)"
CPTSD,fmmizlb,t1_fmmdrzk,1586206135.0,"Right!?. I mean for fucks sake. I literally said this to them when I was a child myself, 25 odd years ago. They would say that thing about nobody writing a book, and I would point out that Dr Spock wrote a book that was 50 years old at that point, and had sold better than any commercially available book had ever in the history of humanity. Because shockingly good parents want to hear ideas on how to raise children, even if everything is not as valuable as everything else their still good ideas overall. Nope, silly hippie who was either too kindly and unreasonable, or too academic and an ivory tower, really anything not to read a book, and reflect at all on their parenting. 

And there is as you say a whole damned section if Dr Spock did not do it for a person. Just so infuriating. Its almost as if all such concerns were a red herring designed to hide the fact they did not care what was best, and believed their ownership of their children as property essentially trumped everything else. You know, almost. But hey, such serious parenting books have only been out since just after World War II, they totally didn't know. Lol is right, just such self serving and reprehensible nonsense."
CPTSD,fmmhv7y,t1_fmlyo8e,1586205549.0,"Your just so right. A different species says it well. My own parents had enormous barriers and a ton of seemingly excellent excuses. Yet press them on it then and fundamentally it came down to parental rights, and how nobody would tell them what to do. Tear away all the ""we knew no better"" or ""we were raised worse"", and that all you find, they didn't want to in the end, and didn't feel they should have to. And your so right, they sure did know how to put a false face on. Cowards is right, and thank you so much for saying it. We did survive, and get better, being able to be here for each other means a great deal to me, and thought it hurts at times I am glad. It really is amazing, and thank you so much for the kind words, and just for being here :)"
CPTSD,fmliws5,t1_fmlgs48,1586187315.0,"It really gives me such hope, the courage is amazing. I do not believe there is anything going on there now, its 30 years later. It wasn't a ring really, a few people we were warned to stay away from by other kids, and only in my predators case am I sure they were actively luring children. But it sadly was a weird place. I went to school in that community, I feel sure there were kids who were being molested whose parents had moved them to such a small place intentionally. 

The half abandoned nature of it did allow for luring predators to be more of a thing. But nothing organized I am aware of. Still a spooky place to me. Though I am male when I think of returning I can only think of Jenny's return to her childhood home in Forrest Gump. My abuser is either very old or dead now though, I will never know. That keeps me from returning as well, that if he were alive I could not add the darkness onto me of hurting an old man no matter what he did, and likely would were he alive. 10 more years perhaps, 

I may return once I am sure he is dead or taken to a home out of town. Perhaps it will be healing then. I do not mean to imply an organized thing then, or that could be continuing now, just a place that gave shitty monsters more opportunities than is normal sadly. The guts in your experience is amazing though. I have trouble with it just as a place, the very buildings and ground itself. To do it when abusers are wandering around, its incredible, and far beyond what I could consider. It gives me real hope, thank you so much for it, and I really just hope it was such a valuable and healing experience. :)"
CPTSD,fmld8uv,t1_fmlbfow,1586184067.0,"That would be fine. The issue is identifying as a therapist in particular, or a psychologist or psychiatrist or clinical social worker, a specific title. And putting it in the title of your post.  But if you identify as a mental health professional generally, and put that identification in the body of your post rather than the title, you can call it a list of tools you have found helpful for recovery in your own journey, without going into detail about your own abuse or trauma. 

The idea is that if your going to identify as a specific titled professional the community needs to know first and foremost your a survivor, which is why self divulging would be needed in those cases. Otherwise going soft on your qualifications, keeping it to mental health professional and keeping that out of the post title, is needed so that reinforces your identity as a survivor first and foremost. The idea is that you do not need to hide your qualifications, but should be coming at it from a perspective of a survivor primarily. The tools are great though, and I hope this makes sense."
CPTSD,fmlchwv,t1_fml90zh,1586183623.0,"This is really interesting. I just hate sounding so negative. But its not the data issue at its core, though I worry it some I do largely believe the points I made about the data security being almost certainly largely safe, the company has too much incentive, the safeguards really are likely quite solid. For me its that I physically avoid looking at the weird little box screen, with someone who looks vaguely like the human I know, but with all sorts of little jinks and pixelation issues in their appearance. Perfect video fidelity from my end, a poor person on disability with a part time job as janitor and the computer to match, and that is a technological solution that may change my mind. 

Probably not though, nothing in the world is going to replace face to face connection, ever in my view, besides the essentially perfected and widespread dispersal of VR equipment several generations past where we are now. And even in that case I will be bitching about the philosophical implications. I should say I am unusual personally at this point. I do not own a smartphone, and never have, nor have I ever sent a text. I am not on any other social media, and never have been, I only joined Reddit 2 years ago at 36 when a social worker I trusted a great deal told me it was different, which it was. I use a smart TV, which gives me Youtube and Netflix, and a laptop tethered to the wall, because the battery is too old otherwise. 

I just bought a good new computer, but keep that at family I visit regularly's house so its safer, and still tether it to a wall out of habit. The Covid thing is making eating tough, because I eat out almost entirely, and never learned online banking at all. I may not be the core demographic for such changes as we're talking about in truth. I grown to love Reddit, and this community in particular, a great deal. But its an unusually capable pseudo television I can read magazines on, that is the internet for me otherwise. I am really not trying to dig at tele-therapy. I am waiting for real therapy to resume personally, and am not particularly open to anything less. But that really is my stuff, and has little to do with the great ideas people are finding helpful every single day."
CPTSD,fmlawjm,t1_fml8ru5,1586182662.0,"I understand completely, this makes complete sense. I think the other post must have talked more from lived experience though, or in truth we just missed it as mods. An issue is these types of posts are not unpopular usually. This is a rare case where the community in unaware of the larger issue. The community usually reports problematic posts. But if its well written and sounds real and genuine, which this very much did, then often they do not report it. But if their allowed just broadly then we will get all sorts of things in time, and more and more non scientific stuff. That is allowed here, we do not silence survivors unusual ideas for recovery, but we don't want to encourage it overall of course, and that is what the bulk of survivor/helpers are creating in a larger sense I would say. Also in time your going to get more straight up gurus, charlatans, and people with obvious profit motives. I am afraid this is the thin end of the wedge, its less about your in principle valid post, and more about where it leads, and how I have trouble explaining why your different to others. 

If another post is allowed that is almost certainly because the person has spoken a solid chunk about their own direct lived experience. We do not insist survivors divulge normally of course, but if their going to make full posts about some direct thing they have created to help others they kind of do need to self divulge, for the sake of transparency. You absolutely can put this in the Weekly Vents and Victories thread though, its clearly a valid and helpful thing overall, as the comments and upvotes tend to show. As I say, this is as reasonable and grey area a post as it could be, and meant kindly, that is clear. Its just the thin end of a wedge on a public forum on Reddit in the end. Sorry again for the need, and I really hope this makes sense."
therapy,fml9q8z,t3_fvyxir,1586181931.0,"It depends upon the resiliency of the child internally, and the severity of the fighting. If the child was in fear for their lives, it does not have to be objectively a valid fear but the kid does need to be in absolute terror of death for themselves or their caregiver, then it can, yes. Whether that is what is called a ""small T"" trauma, something that was traumatic at the time but the person largely got over, or a ""big T"" trauma, something the person is still affected by later in life, is based on the child's internal resiliency. Not a judgment of course, adults should not be placing children in abject fear and its clearly not the kid's fault. 

But that is the basic idea, PTSD requires genuine and deep emotional fear of death, and well it does not have to be entirely objective there really usually needs to be some foundation for that. Like there actually has to be fighting, if the kid is genuinely scared of death from ghosts that could be a sign of other abuse, could be psychosis or delusions, could be lots of stuff. So its gotta have some real foundation, even if that is not objectively perfect, since the kid cannot know its not objectively true they won't die, and if they truly and genuinely fear it that can lead to PTSD. 

Complex PTSD can come about from less death based stuff, but that is typically from quite severe and sustained child abuse, a handful of fights will not usually do it. But that is the resiliency of the child as well, if the fights were severe enough, and the child particularly sensitive or disabled, that could do it in some cases. Any other abuse, trauma, abandonment, or anything like that can add to the chances of CPTSD. Severe emotional or physical neglect, or attachment/abandonment trauma is also highly correlated to CPTSD. Only a psychiatrist can diagnose of course. But that is the basic idea anyway."
CPTSD,fml7yq4,t3_fvus0e,1586180802.0,"I just started this with my groups for the mental health drop in center I attend, well its physical doors are closed. I find it weird and off putting, and have not been attending. I will wait until they reopen. The same agency that is doing it employs my addiction counselor, and he has no interest in it either, he has been attending groups with voice only. And my trauma therapist simply has not even brought such an idea up, we're doing purely telephone therapy as well at this point. I mean I hate the telephone for this. But the Zoom or whatever is no better, just weirder. And quite frankly I do not want to encourage this in the system, which knows telephone therapy is not sufficient, but may get ideas in its head if adoption of teleconferencing crap is normalized. For me personally its complete and utter nonsense. This current time is a crisis, and doing this is clearly vital to everyone's safety, so be it. But getting through this period and back to real therapy face to face is the goal for me. 

I always spend 5 or 10 minutes bitching generally about such technologies, and the current difficulty I feel with this crisis, and generally about how such things are crap for connection or an alliance, and is obviously unhelpful for those with dissociation, and how we're now beholden to a corporation who absolutely has to have all that data as a technological fact and we must simply trust their safeguards, and security regarding hacking, and how I personally simply hate it. 5 or 10 minutes every sessions anyway, its replaced 'how was your week' as a starting point. I will never accept it, and will forego therapeutic, medical, or any other such care if I have to in order to never help normalize it. 

I do see how helpful it is for others, and am glad. Hacking is actually pretty darned unlikely, and a major video conferencing company dealing with business people engaged in often quite secretive strategy and deals over their service is likely to have really solid safeguards against that information being insecure internally. People have good reason to have confidence in it, and if its helpful to others individually I am glad. I will not normalize it in any larger sense though, and personally hate it a lot though. I don't like being negative, but you ask, and that is how I feel about it personally."
CPTSD,fml5p71,t3_fvrzn0,1586179249.0,"Hey. I am a moderator, and have to remove this. Its just too clearly a rule 7 issue regarding self promotion. We're a pure support community for trauma survivors here, seeking support, questions, advice, or speaking to ones owned lived experience, such things are all we are here for in any larger sense. I do not personally disbelieve you, but we really discourage people from saying their therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, and such. Saying one is a mental health professional is one thing, we have more than a few here and that is common enough and is allowed. 

But full on saying one is a specific title is an issue, it appeals too much to authority on a pseudo anonymous internet forum like this, such identification can make survivors feel unsafe as they have no proof and are understandably suspicious of appeals to authority, and it can cause fighting amongst members over the legitimacy of that claim. But the rule 7 issue is the main thing. We do allow self promotion that is CPTSD related, which clearly this is, in the ""Weekly Vents and Victories thread"". 

The thing is if we allowed self promotion it would just be far too common. So many survivors have a favorite book, Youtube channel, podcast, blog, and such. Also survivors who have written their own book, or are a creator or helper in all sorts of ways, is not particularly rare. If it was allowed it would be too common, would clutter the sub, and take away from the pure support community role we have here. I do see the kindness in this very much, and you can put this in the Weekly Vents and Victories thread. I am sorry about the need for this, though as a mental health professional I guess you can understand the issue. I really hope so, and do hope you can feel welcome here otherwise."

It is obvious to me you were just trying to give valuable insight that helped you. But in this community this is what we call the Trauma Olympics, which is a rule issue, and not allowed. Its just really invalidating to others. This is a pure support community for PTSD, its that context as much as anything. This is in the end a political concept, at the deeper level of the word political. I did create a new, but growing, community for discussions regarding trauma, including the respectful discussion of whether some forms of trauma are more destructive overall, the validity of the ACE scoring system, and such, called r/TraumaAndPolitics. You absolutely did put this entirely respectfully. But its a divisive topic that can be hurtful to some survivors, understandably, and its just not allowed in this pure support community. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmk15dv,t3_fvq3kk,1586142071.0,"In truth I don't. I try to focus on if I am happier overall, more hopeful, my relationships are good, my job is going properly, and such. I try to gain more awareness of whether I am particularly unsafe, suicidal, my sobriety is at risk, and all that. That gets better, realizing I am doing poorly. But I have never truly felt safe, not since early childhood. I have continued to be in poverty, and in more chaotic circumstances, amongst untreated serious trauma survivors with severe addictions/homelessness/criminality issues, and in relatively dangerous living circumstances and sometimes ongoing abuse my entire adult life though. My adulthood was more a continuation of my childhood in truth. Therapy has helped enormously. So many practical and deeper emotional changes have happened since I entered recovery 3 years ago at 36. 

I, with the help of the therapist and social workers, was on a path fully out of the chaos and abuse, college and a car and a real career, over the next 18 months. A 1 year trade degree, but in a field me and those helping me are sure I can do easily enough, with plenty of work in it anyway. That has extended to 2 years because of Covid, but is still ongoing. Being happier, more functional, with real goals and plans, that is the idea at this point. From what I can tell the therapists idea is that once I get to a certain point with that stuff seeking out a real sense of deeper internal safety will be more possible. But in truth outside that I have never really felt safe I don't think. 

I am always aware bad things can happen anywhere, and am on guard nearly constantly at some level. Maybe before I was 8, things get pretty hazy memory wise, I like to think I felt safe as a baby. But I was born premature and spent 4 months in an incubator as my first life experience, so maybe not. I do know things can improve enormously though, and do think feeling a deeper sense of internal safety is possible, to know and truly believe we are safe. I am not there yet in truth, but everything I have seen in trauma recovery says that it is, and I do believe it. I wish I knew more, but I can empathize and relate a great deal, and really hope it gets so much better for you, and I, and all of us, very much. :)"
therapy,fmjfpqi,t3_fvnh8h,1586129407.0,"Yes, its entirely normal. Its not inherently unhealthy, depending on how big a part of your life the imaginary friends are. I personally had elaborate fantasy worlds with a great many characters that were quite real to me, and functioned as imaginary friends a great deal. I did not really, fundamentally stop believing a rabbit hole or wardrobe or some sort of entrance to a real such realm was not a valid possibility until I was 18 or so, 19 even. I do have autism, its a bit old otherwise in truth, and the older one gets the more being on the spectrum seems possible as an explanation. But even for ""normal"" people this is not abnormal, with a less than ideal or traumatic childhood some delayed emotional growth is normal. 

You don't have to let these friends go in the end, ever. Many creative people started with such things as foundations to their ideas. How much you believe in it as a reality, if it is taking away from or damaging your real life relationships, that is the only issue that can be a problem here. Therapy can help all of this a great deal, to look at the core emotions that drive a person to create a more solid imaginary friend and really bond more, rather than the more free form creativity that is more common as young people get older. 

That is the only part of this that is unusual for anyone really, that its a bit more narrowly focused of an idea. But we all have imaginations in the end. Its not abnormal or weird overall at all. If your finding it impacts your life, or how much you care about it and its lack of reality begins to distress you, therapy can help a great deal. It absolutely can be kept and used in a healthy way though, and nothing here sounds unhealthy about you as a person overall at all. That interacting with them is constant does seem potentially a little worrying, and I would consider therapy. But this can be processed and incorporated into a healthy way of thinking absolutely, and these experiences are not uncommon at all."
CPTSD,fmjbnl8,t3_fvmhee,1586127022.0,"This is so incredibly brave of you. I really hope it gave you something, allowed grieving or helped to feel valid or real, anything I guess, just that it was helpful. I experienced my CSA in a village like you describe that we lived in for 6 months, and moved just after I turned 9. It was a dead town even then, 30 years ago. A store, a community center, a church and a school, and a public greenhouse, nothing more besides residences. It had been twice the size, but the little army base it existed because of moved 40 years ago. Half the residences were abandoned, and kids were sent out on their own to play with little regard for safety back then, sadly it allowed things to happen that should not have, besides the predators own responsibility of course. 

I have checked about it online, the town is just as pointless and half dead as ever. I have never gained the courage to return. Sometimes I think of doing so, but I don't drive and would need a ride to go, and its a tough idea to really plan for it, so I never have. It take an enormous amount of courage.

CPTSD,fmixoim,t3_ftj5vv,1586119000.0,"Hey. I just wanted to tell people about 2 new trauma support communities I have created. One is r/TraumaAndPolitics, which is for the intersection of trauma and political issues of essentially any kind. It is still a support environment, but is designed to have the sort of posts and discussions that in principle should be acceptable here, but in practice just do not fit in here. Pure support posts are allowed, self promotion posts are allowed, and well a purist free speech environment is impossible well still being a support community this is an attempt to create more of that sort of idea for complex trauma survivors.

Also there is r/CPTSDmusic, which just seemed an obvious enough idea I was surprised it had not been done yet. Both communities are growing consistently, r/TraumaAndPolitics at 150+ members at month 3 is growing well, and r/CPTSDmusic at 50+ members at just barely 2 months is moving along in a solid way.

We're the largest PTSD specific community in the world I believe, but the number 2 trauma community. It is entirely possible RBN is bigger than every other trauma community on Reddit combined. 

That is valid, there is usually a single largest example in any group of communities or systems, but it does mean I have to mention it essentially every time, their culture could overwhelm us here too easily. Its not a huge deal at all, just a reminder. I really hope this makes sense. Also I should mention r/CPTSDmusic in this case, its new, but it has a decent amount of content and is growing.

I mean I am really glad for those who are finding things easier, but I personally find it tough, and am sorry you do as well. I really hope things improve soon. I get what your going through in my own way I think. For one thing I do not cook, nor have either the space or things with which to cook even if I wanted to learn. Eating out was nice, I did a microwave for many years, but recovery and a part time job have allowed more options. Now its the one pizza place and the 7/11's fried chicken and such, because everyone else does online payments and smartphones, neither of which I do. So that is tough. And now, today, the province here shut down legal marijuana delivery from private services. But their still allowing it from the government itself, and that government weed has to be picked up at the post office, thus destroying any purpose regarding Covid that could have existed. Its actually worse this way, before one guy, the same every time, came right to my door. Now I have to go to a post office, which even if it allows people in one at a time still has like 4 people working there, besides the fact that even a social distance marked line is still more of an issue than being in ones own home. 

The theory was that if they stop it outright everyone will be out wandering around to their dealer. But keeping it an essential service like the beer and liquor store, which remain open, was apparently too obvious. Oh, and distinctions are not being made for medicinal marijuana, though as I say the beer and liquor stores remain open, and I never once heard of a doctor giving a prescription for beer. Just the most poorly thought out idiocy imaginable on the governments part. I wish I knew what more to do. its just a really frustrating time right now. I wish I had more than empathy, but I have a great deal of it for you and all of us, and just hope things improve as quickly as possible."
CPTSD,fmfyic2,t1_fm18d1r,1586037511.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove a couple of comments. I get how this was triggering, if someone is gaslighting you, or tone policing. But the best thing is to report such things, lashing back at people is just not allowed. I really hope you understand. And the attempt therapeutic confrontation is just too much, ""high neuroticism"", ""harmful dysfunctions"", ""not virtues, but vices"", and such. Unless feedback is specifically asked for such is largely not allowed here. I mean if the OP took it well, or it wasn't reported, it could be left up. But things like that are always questionable, and when reported just too confrontational. I do get you were trying to help though, this is not a bigger deal in any larger sense. I just really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmfx7xs,t1_fmclgb3,1586036740.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove a couple comments here. To explain, complaining about downvotes is one thing, labeling people ""delicate flowers"" is more an attack on the community, or sections of it. Also well I have nothing but respect for those who work in psychiatric care it should be noted that their being a ""certain context"" where being mean is somehow different than in any interaction is too close the sort of justifications abusers have used. I can accept its not the case here of course, but its triggering to others. Also stating the OP is trying to control others is an issue. If you check under rule 1 there is a link called ""more info"". 

Early in that more detailed explanation is the specific words ""don't be needlessly confrontational, antagonistic, or argumentative. This is not a good space for debates, crusades, or vendettas"". This is in the end a pure support community for PTSD. That is solely how its defined, we do not have an official modality of course, being peer support. But as a generally leaning towards any modality we are pretty overtly Rogersian here, which as a mental health professional I imagine you are aware of. I can see you were trying to help, and this sort of thing does happen. But its just too confrontational for this community. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmfvs41,t1_fmfu132,1586035874.0,"Its really great and nice of you to be so understanding, understandably people often take removals hard. That sounds like a lot of maturity from here. And its normal, when I was young myself, and at 39 if I told you I never said ""bloody kids"" in real life once in a blue moon I would be lying. Its just the context of this place more than anything, which you were wonderfully understanding of. Really, thanks so much for that, and I hope you just continue to feel really welcome here. :)"
CPTSD,fmfuxsi,t3_funt41,1586035370.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and am going to lock this. Your feelings are valid entirely, and normal with CPTSD. And this is clearly a legitimate vent post. That being said its just too confrontational for others in this community. Its got like 3 reports at this point as a potential rule 1 issue. In principle its not at all, its a vent. But at a certain point I have to consider the larger safety of the community. Every other comment your getting is unhelpful, and it seems unlikely people are going to respond better. The anger is valid, but I think the general idea is that is misplaced, likely from abusers, onto non severe trauma survivors at large. 

That is fine, the issue normally would be you acknowledge feeling bad, and state its a feeling and not an objective truth. It does sound like your saying its objectively true in the center, between those qualifying statements though, and its clearly triggering to others. I get it, your certainly entitled to your own feelings and beliefs. But your unlikely to get much more good from this, and its triggering to the community. Its within the rules, and I am not removing it. But it does have to be locked. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmftqhl,t1_fmfdddt,1586034653.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. Its not a huge deal, I do see how it can be thought of as different or just happen. But there can't be disparaging things about whole specific groups, ie: ""fuckin boomer"". I am not saying this is equivalent to racism and such, not at all. In the end some push pull dynamic or issues between generations is just far more normal than that. That being said, it was reported, and we do have a proportional number of older trauma survivors here, and it is a rule 3 issue. Not a huge deal, and I do get it. But its just too invalidating to those older members in a support forum for PTSD. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmdw1r4,t1_fmbjg3l,1585979822.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. Its a rule 1 issue. If you check under rule 1 there is a link that says ""more info"". One of the first lines explaining is ""Don't be needlessly confrontational, antagonistic, or argumentative. This is not a good space for debates, crusades, or vendettas"". I can absolutely understand if this was triggering, and am sorry for it, and that people seem so crappy right now overall. But this simply starts with several separate sentences saying things contrary to the OP, and later the implication the OP thinks their better than others. In the end we're a pure support community for PTSD. Its just too confrontational. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmdvl2y,t1_fmc0xxd,1585979379.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. Its a rule 1 issue. The OP was specifically speaking to their own feelings, not objective fact. I really am incredibly sorry it was triggering. That is entirely valid. I do get it, and its not a big deal overall. But it is pretty clear as an individual comment. Telling another survivor in a PTSD support community they remind you of your abuser is not acceptable at all. If you feel triggered by a post and you have an concern at all it is, or even might be, a rule violation, reporting it is always valid. If its not a rule violation the best idea is to scroll past. But this is just way too confrontational, I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmduzas,t1_fmcb4k7,1585978807.0,"Hey, this was reported, and I wanted to say I am absolutely not removing it. I do not think I have ever done this to validate not removing something, but I will here. You are welcome here, very much. We do not allow political discussion overall really much at all. There is overlap with CPTSD and politics, but that really has to be quite specific to people's lived experience or its not allowed. If purely political discussion is happening its because its not being reported is what it comes down to. I created a small new community,  but its growing continuously, r/TraumaAndPolitics, that speaks more directly to the intersection of anything political really at all, and its intersection with politics. We're as much a free speech zone for survivors there as is possible well still being a support community for trauma survivors. 

If your more or less a full on Nazi that will be an issue, support for things like the camps on the southern US border, or specifically arguing against trans people, and such. But not the people who advocate those views, except in the rarest cases. Trump specifically, and people such as David Duke specifically, but anyone less inherently hurtful and divisive is allowed. On either side say Andrea Dworkin and Jordan Peterson as the far points of acceptable dialogue, which seems a pretty free speech zone for survivors as can exist well being helpful. I wanted to mention it, your welcome in any case. But that is not r/CPTSD, at all. Its not just you, its everyone, this is a support community for trauma survivors and nothing more.  

You may very well have different politics than most people here, it seems likely. It does not make your complex post traumatic stress disorder, or the hideous abuse that created it, any less valid whatsoever. If you want a place to speak your ideas there is a growing place for that. But certainly you belong here, and if you dislike politics here I can only agree with you, and highly encourage reporting such things. But I am not removing this. You speak specifically and solely to your own feelings. In the edit you are not attacking a person, nor the community. Your a bit irritated about mystery downvotes, that has no person your being a jerk to, nor can I see how its triggering to anyone. You do belong here, very much so. I just wanted to explain that, and really do hope you know your welcome here, very much so."
CPTSD,fmdt9ob,t3_fulrnj,1585977234.0,"Hey, I am a moderator and have to remove this. The reason is solely that we do not allow meta posts about or to the sub, callout posts against other users, or things like that at all. It is notable there was an extremely rare exception today, which I explain in full within that thread, and I eventually had to lock. But I just want to make it clear this is solely due to the meta post issue. We go months before making even a temporary exception, and that is solely in cases nobody catches it early and then it becomes so popular it would be invalidating to the community as a whole to delete it. 

But even then such posts inevitably end up locked, for the same reason as all such posts, they lead in time only to fighting and bad blood, which can spill into other threads. Your core feelings are not wrong though, at all. You did, very clearly, say you already felt bad and were looking for empathy and relatedness. This is a pure support community for PTSD, and more so than other places. Your basic concerns are not wrong in the least, and I really am sorry you were invalidated and hurt. It is brave to speak of such darker feelings. But I just feel like you got a lot of good from the community. I mean its just there were 67 comments on that post, and I removed like 3 or 4. It got nearly 200 upvotes. You got 42 upvotes at this point, less than 2 hours when I had to remove it. 

The community does care about you, and does support you, overall it really seems to do so. If someone said ""fuck you"" I don't remember it in removing anything. I kind of should, its a more serious thing, but things have been unusually busy the last 2 days overall. If you tell me who said that that I removed I will not say more now, but I absolutely keep an eye in future, cursing at people is a pattern of behavior sort of thing that can lead to a ban, and if its out of the blue at an OP and not part of a discussion that went downhill that is more notable. And if a person harassed you in PM that is a big issue, its like a super rule 1 issue, and leads to an immediate temp ban or ban depending on the history the member has here. I need a screenshot, but PM harassment is something we take very seriously. 

And considering something like that happening I can absolutely see how you were triggered. Its entirely valid. I do not think you should remove yourself from the conversation at all. I hope you do not. The one really crappy comment and few too confrontational comments would be hurtful, I do get that. I have done that myself many times, to notice only the bad interactions, and not the good. But there were literally dozens of supportive comments. And more here. Your certainly entitled to get angry about crappy comments. And if comments are acceptable, but you just can't relate, its entirely reasonable to feel sad or hurt and such. Your feelings are not invalid or wrong at all. 

But as a community member for 2 years and a mod for over 1 I keep feeling like you got a lot of support here. We're just about as pure a support community as exists, but it is the internet, and Reddit, some resiliency is needed. What people do in a community like this typically, if they find the post to be too angry, depressive, offensive, or whatever, is to ignore it. We're too support based, and that is the valid way of making community standards known. It happens all the time, its happened to me more than a few times posting as a member. A post just sits, and many hours later it gets 1 or 2 little comments out of essentially kind pity. 

And it gets like 4, or 7 upvotes or something, just to show base support. That is what would have occurred if your post was too much in some way, or your feelings perceived as invalid. They aren't, and wouldn't have been regardless, but that is how it would have gone if people did not support you. Nearly 200 upvotes is really substantial support in a community this size. You really do seem to be supported, and your feelings related to a lot. I get how confrontational people, and in particular crappy people, can be triggering. And I know how frustrating being told to look at the good can be. But I would keep reporting any comment you have an issue with whatsoever. 

No matter what I or the other mod decide it is reasonable to thing that person was a bit of a jerk, because to you he was. Even if its not technically, or even if you were wrong in some larger objective sense, its still valid to allow yourself to feel that you felt like they were a jerk. Past that I would try to look at the good. There was a lot of it from all I can tell. Anyway I just wanted to explain and address your concern. The whole meta post issue is an important one, I have to remove this for that, in time your too likely to get more problematic replies. But its not your basic idea, at all. You were, you were open and vulnerable, and super clear about feeling bad, and made your needs known quite specifically. Your not wrong here. I just hope you can see more of the good in time. Anyway I do gotta remove this. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmclxin,t1_fmbelfh,1585948211.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. I get this felt attacking or invalidating, I do, its very strongly worded. But in the end the OP is not attacking anyone. Their solely speaking to their feelings, not their logic, and they quite specifically feel bad about it, hence the ""I feel like an ass"" in the title. I can entirely see how this could be hurtful, and you absolutely worded it wonderfully. As confrontation its very kind, wonderful stuff. But such level of confrontation is just not allowed here, its a rule 1 issue. If you see such a post you can report it to us, even if your unsure its encouraged, or you can scroll past, both are valid. And I really am sorry about this, this is not a huge deal overall at all, and I do hope you feel welcome here a great deal, and really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmckltp,t3_fudsgc,1585947474.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. I get the anger towards abusers, very much so. Its entirely valid and reasonable to be angry, and these sort of thoughts are not particularly uncommon with CPTSD in many cases. Initially when I saw this title I thought it may be okay, we do allow survivors to have a voice, discussion of the general feeling of wanting to kill is much like the general discussion of suicidality, and a valid discussion for trauma survivors. But this simply goes too far. It mentions a specific weapon, which you say you have, and mentions a ""her"" in regards to its use. It is just too clearly over the line of advocating violence, and it just can't be allowed. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmcjqw8,t1_fmcg65v,1585947009.0,"This is really so kind of you!, thank you so much. I often think my biggest worry besides over-protectiveness is that I talk to much. The other mods tend to explain the same basic points in less than half as long, everything I write tends towards novels. That can be frustrating to others sometimes. But I do try, and in truth essentially always do, speak to any and all concerns or issues brought to me, and really address the persons idea. I may be allergic to brevity when I do it, but I do. And I do try to always speak kindly, and even in extreme cases, abusiveness and racism and such, I do then simply give a non confrontation, if somewhat formal, full explanation of the rule. People who come here are invariably trauma survivors. Even people its impossible to term other than trolls tended to find us because their trauma survivors, though sadly their trauma has made them hard to reach at this point in their lives, and they may not be able to fit in right now. 

Those cases are actually quite rare. But even then people deserve decency and respect for how they got there, as much as possible, and everyone deserves to have an explanation for what rule they actually broke if their going to get into trouble for it. Even if its obvious, there will be no arbitrariness or whims here, as its a foundation to every abusive system I ever saw. Anyway I do go on, and am sorry for it. But honestly thank you so much for this, it means a ton to me. I know I give off a stuffy and at times pretentious vibe. 

It is not my intent, I am nearly 40, I do live on disability for autism at this point, though therapy has been life changing and I begin college soon. I am learning to accept it, self love and all that. Because I do try to be open and vulnerable, to be kind, and I take this role very seriously, and care deeply about this community and those in it. This is hugely validating. I am truly incredibly glad you can feel safety in this place, enormously so. And I cannot thank you enough for the kind words. I have been down on myself recently thinking I am a fool for being unable to communicate care or compassion without sounding verbose and silly. And likely I do at times. But to know someone can see the feeling and intent there, it really means an enormous amount to me today. I am prone to bits of weepiness in truth, it really means a ton. I cannot thank you enough, and really hope your day can be such a beautiful one."
CPTSD,fmcgfa1,t1_fmc7vcx,1585945174.0,"We do take the default position that we're here for empathy, compassion, relatedness, and respect. To provide empathy or speak to one owns lived experience as a foundation. If the OP asks an open ended question as the point of their post then opinion and interpretation is fine. If they ask for advice or feedback then that is fine. If they are just venting the OP should likely flair that. But people do forget, or are not technically inclined and do not even consider it. We do remind people about trigger warnings every time they forget, but just highly encourage flair generally speaking. But if the OP sounds like their just venting and does not ask for feedback or advice or whatever, the assumption should be they purely want support. If they later in the comments ask for advice one can give it then. 

Its really about meeting the OP where they are, and its safest to assume support is wanted. I think some peoples assertion its victim blaming is a little, or sometimes not a little, strong to say. Its mostly people who are clearly trying to be nothing but helpful the vast bulk of the time in my experience. But if people are triggered they may feel it as victim blaming, which is understandable, even when its not likely the true motivation or how most people would take it. We are a relatively pure support community in the end, more so than other places like this. So we place that onus on the community members. If people seem too angry, or depressive, or whiny, or whatever, that is entirely normal to feel. 

If its really severe its how most people feel, and the post gets very few comments. But scrolling past is the most people really should be doing here. In terms of change and progress you are almost certainly right. If people are using this as more than a foundation to get more goal or insight based support, or in conjunction with such more rigorous help in other communities, groups, and therapy itself, that is not likely to lead to change. Person centered peer support has an excellent evidence base for PTSD, and that evidence base also says its almost never sufficient for larger change. This has to be a foundation or side support in other, more serious recovery if one hopes to improve in a meaningful way, in most cases. 

But if people are using this place in a way that does not do that, and just taking support, generally we assume there is a good reason their still in that place in their lives. Ongoing abuse or serious disability/poverty that creates barriers to finding help appears most common there. But in the rare case of someone simply feeding off this place in an unhealthy way, in the end their still survivors, and its not for me to judge. In that case they may not get the improvement they want, but so long as their within the rules its not for me to say. They can always have this place, and take what it can give. Frankly if they just keep up with venting and wanting compassion solely for an extended period of time the amount the community will give goes down substantially. 

Because of the just scroll past standard people are encouraged to apply with posts they cannot relate or empathize with. But if that is all that survivor can process right now then their entitled to be here, and take what is offered. We are serious trauma survivors in the end, and though some people have quite severe issues at times that is in the end not their fault, it is the fault of the damned child abusers who did it to them. The intent here is to create a safe space for all survivors so much as possible, and that at its core means a safe space for the most vulnerable amongst us, even if they can feel frustrating at times. 

That is the baseline, within reason. OP's gotta make their needs known. If they want interpretation, insight, advice, feedback, and such they largely do need to ask for it. I mean if they don't ask for it and someone gives it to them anyway, and the OP takes that well, we do not remove things based on a third party reporting it. That would be taking it to far. But yeah, generally speaking if the OP wants more than empathy and relatedness they need to say so, and community members should largely only give what is asked for, and scroll past those they cannot be helpful to. Its not the only thing that is important to survivors in terms of recovery at all. But its a needed role, I think the enormous growth of this community shows that, and it is our role here as a more pure support based community. I just really hope this makes sense."
CPTSD,fmcbml6,t1_fmc6usa,1585942575.0,"Thanks as well for understanding. In terms of you question, basically that is it. As much as I do not think anyone is to blame, if you or others are seeing an uptick of crappy comments that is because there is more I am not seeing, because of the sheer increase in size of the community. We did take on another mod a couple months ago or so, and she appears to be working out wonderfully. I really hate laying it on the community members to police this place more. But I do not know what else I can suggest, the bigger we get the less likely I or the other mods are to see it randomly in our role as members of the community, which is the only time I am clicking on threads. If I tried to check each thread as mod this would become a full time job at this point, as it is I spend 1 to 3 hours a day doing this, every day, and nnce in a blue moon 4 or more. I just don't know what more the mods can do. Taking on even more moderators is an idea, but for them to work they need to have been here a good while and been highly active and helpful, they need to want the job, and burnout is always an issue. 

And the issue is they would only be taking part of my stuff in the mod queue out of my hands, and the issue isn't that I mind the amount of work I have, there would need to be more reports and work to justify the need for more moderators, which is always a transition. I really am trying to think firstly what it is I can do. But right now that is my best idea I am afraid, people have to report bad behavior or potential bad behavior more often. I am just not seeing that uptick of bad behavior, people here seem really great to me in any larger sense. If community members are I see no other option but to report more. I really wish I had more of an idea. I just hope this makes sense."
CPTSD,fmc6fvk,t1_fmbr5qq,1585939782.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. I get this post was triggering to you, and am sorry for that. But its just too confrontation to accuse people of victim blaming and such, and a rule 1 issue. If you have a concern about a post bringing it to the mods is the thing that is encouraged. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmc5xup,t3_fu8icq,1585939515.0,"Hey, I am a moderator. I am really at a bit of a loss as to the best thing to do here. I guess I will leave this up, because its got 316 upvotes in 4 hours at this point, and I do not want to invalidate the community. I may have locked it normally, but the comments are not an issue at this point. But I should say, this sort of meta post speaking about or to the whole community, callout posts against other members, and anything like that is normally just not allowed. Its the upvotes and basic core of your point that I can make an exception for, because we really do take these concerns seriously. But normally your supposed to come to us with any concerns or issues or critique. We are always open to it, and willing to have that dialogue. Also transparency is vital, which is another reason to leave the occasional post like this up when that discussion is proving helpful and its not been discussed in the community recently, which it has not. But honestly, its gotta by discouraged, and I gotta make it clear this is an exception that I hope speaks to everyone with this concern, meta posts just as a basic are not allowed. 

Also if the comments section goes off the rails and I get numerous reports I will have to lock this at that point. The issue is if this is not highly discouraged, and months do not go by between exceptions, we will get posts calling out this and that and debating what recovery and support ""really are"" all the time. That will not make your concern better, that leads to fighting and bad blood between members the vast bulk of the time. Sorry, that had to be mentioned. As to your main concern. I am just not sure what more can be done to make this a compassionate, supportive and safe place. The rules here and the general principles of the mod team here are more support based and person centered than any other such community I am familiar with. 

Like its the main serious critique of this community, that we're too rigidly person centered, a ""syrup vat"" a longtime member called it once. I do not believe that is the case, and argue in favor of the value of quite purist person centered values regularly, indeed at length yesterday here. But certainly I have trouble thinking of a similar community with such an emphasis on pure support. Our rule 1 and 3 is quite rigidly enforced in truth, and well you see similar with rule 3 most such places no other community takes really anything like our rule 1 to nearly the degree we do here. That being said, there is only so much that can be done. This is the internet in the end, a public forum and Reddit, and some resiliency will be needed. Like I am personally a purist Rogersian. But it is simply impossible to run a community in a purist person centered fashion. 

I would end up invalidating and removing things all day from people who were really and deeply trying only to be kind and helpful. If people are starting with how they do not intend to invalidate, and if their not personalizing it and are largely speaking from their own perspective and using I statements, we can't be tone policing every potential invalidation, or then those survivors end up invalidated. There has to be some room for dialogue. I am just not sure what more we can do. If people are actually mean or crappy in essentially any real way, or overtly passive aggressive, we absolutely will remove that. If you think its an issue reporting it is encouraged, if it turns out to be an acceptable comment it is still valid to make your concerns known. 

I am wracking my brain trying to see what may have changed. The survivors here seem the same as ever, with no real issues in any larger sense, problematic people still seem quite rare, and I am often and still amazed by what a wonderful community of people this is. The mod team has made no changes of any kind really at all, I have been here a little over a year, I am still looking at the rules the same, and approaching this as a person centered, as much as possible, pure support community for trauma survivors. I am still personally more purist person centered than the rules, and still see over-protectiveness as my main issue in this role. 

When I really consider it I can think of no other reason for the sort of change you mention besides the increase in size of this community. In just over 1 year I have been mod this community has grown from 14 to almost 63 thousand people. That is actually pretty huge. We are no longer a small community. Its a mid sized community, and there are simply more cracks for things to fall through. I hate putting this on the community members individually to help police these issues. I know people are vulnerable, the freeze an fawn response are so common. 

But people have to report things more. The community is simply too large, we cannot see everything in a normal organic way, if it does not end up in the mod queue its a random crapshoot if I see it. I can think of no other real change but the size of this community, and can think of no other real solution to it but people reporting more. If people have any issue, whatsoever, reporting is never the wrong move. See something say something in the end. The mods have to make a judgment call in that case. But we really are making those calls with an inherently support based interpretation of the rules. 

The sheer size increase and people responding by not telling is the only issue I can think of. I am not trying to blame people whatsoever. Our experience as trauma survivors is rarely one where telling authority figures was met with help, in many cases quite the opposite. Its entirely understandable. I really take this concern very seriously. I just don't know what else the issue could be, nothing has fundamentally changed in over a year. I really just hope this makes sense. If anybody has any other concerns, ideas, critiques, questions, or anything, its always encouraged, and welcome. I have gone on quite a bit, and done my best to address and explain, but if anyone wants clarification or dialogue on this or anything else that is also welcome. I just wish I knew more what to do, and really hope this makes sense.

Edit: Okay, I am afraid the time has come to lock this. I have now had a handful of comments in the mod queue. As I say, that is great, not an issue at all and highly encouraged. But this discussion has done as much good as it can. I removed a couple and approved a few of those comments, and even those removed were not that bad at all. But we have gone past a discussion on whether this community is a safe space, and entered more and more into a discussion whether some survivors are not really trying, looking for an echo chamber, and such. I have not seen the term ""victim mentality"" crop up yet, but its only a matter of time. The next thing that tends to happen is other people who support a more empathy driven community reply to those people, and their replies are..less than supportive, and they get reported. Its off the rails I am afraid. 

The mods are still here if people have any concerns, issues, questions, ideas, or feedback, and its always welcomed. I should say this is a really awesome community. It could have gone downhill much quicker, in the end the discussion has 107 comments and 457 upvotes as a write this, and discussion was great pretty much across the board for over 7 hours. This is a contentious topic in places like this, and if a community this size it speaks to how awesome this community and the people in it are. I really can't thank everyone enough, and hope the discussion was valuable. I do have to lock it though, I really hope everyone understands."
CPTSD,fmc3wjq,t1_fmbc78x,1585938427.0,"Hey, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. This is clearly really meant kindly. And its odd, your whole point is to argue in favor of my whole point. The issue is your right, people need empathy and compassion. But that includes empathy for the OP's difficulty in feeling empathy as a survivor. Their pretty clear they feel bad about it. But this is how their pain is coming out. I do get you meant this kindly, and your core point is really great. And I get that a lack of empathy is one thing it is hard for many people to empathize with. Its entirely understandable. 

But their not gatekeeping, their talking about people overall generally, there is no community for them to be gatekeeping in society as a whole. There is here though, and the OP deserves support as much as anyone. I do get it, your underlying kindness in this is clear. Bu as much as I hate to say it its important advice you give, and applies in this situation. If you can't empathize or relate to the OP's position the best thing is to move on to another post. I am sorry about this, it just looks like you have fallen into the same trap your speaking about."
CPTSD,fmc2p9i,t3_fu083y,1585937787.0,"Hey. I am a moderator and have to remove this. Its just too much a rule 6 issue, and not related enough to CPTSD, trauma, abuse, healing, or ones own lived experience. I can see its an attempt to help, very much so. But even past rule 6 the issue of rule 7 comes up regarding self promotion. If we allowed this type of thing we would be flooded with such things. All sorts of trauma survivors have a favorite Youtube thing, book, poscast, blog, and all such stuff. In the end this is a support community for trauma survivors to share and relate. Links like this can be put into the Weekly Vents and Victories thread though. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmc1qbj,t3_fub3c3,1585937266.0,"Hello, I am a moderator and have to remove this. This is just too clearly a rule 1 issue. If you click under rule 1 there is a link that says ""more info"". One of the first things it says in that more detailed explanation is ""Don't be needlessly confrontational, antagonistic, or argumentative. This is not a good space for debates, crusades, or vendettas"". As well we do not allow meta posts speaking to or for or about the whole community, call out posts against other users, or anything like that, which is invariably a rule 1, 6 or 7 issue depending. We do take these concerns seriously. But the thing to do is to come to the mod team with any concerns, which we are always willing to address or have a dialogue about. Meta posts are not allowed though, or parsing our members into sections and attacking some of them. This is a pure support community for PTSD in the end. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fmbr2al,t1_fmbhy68,1585931647.0,"This is just so nice  of you!. It really means so much, I cannot thank you enough. I just hope things are really great for you, goodness knows you deserve it, And I just really hope your day can be such a beautiful one. :)"
CPTSD,fmbqqm9,t1_fmb4m9z,1585931475.0,"This really is so kind of you. I had to sleep, but it meant a lot, thank you so much for it. In terms of the therapist she really was wonderful. The sliding scale rate, really more pro bono, she offered was incredible. Its interesting, that continues until essentially right now, or specifically 2 sessions from now, ending at right about 2 and a half years now. It really was extraordinarily kind of her. There has been a lot of good and progress since then. I held onto that job, and finished highschool. Harm reduction turned into sobriety about 6 months after I wrote that, and is now 18 months sobriety. College was the next step, in September. Just a 1 year trade diploma, but it will get me a real career within 2 more years. Not a glamorous one, and the pay is not great hour for hour really at all, a few bucks more but directly tethered to minimum wage. But there is lots of work in the field, me and her and others are quite sure I can do it, and what the field lacks in pay it makes up for in overtime, so that decent money is there if one is willing to work for it, as well as benefits in many cases. 

And a respectable role as a thing in society. Now is just enormously better than before therapy, and this next step will be far better than disability and the part time janitorial job I have now. This whole path would have taken 18 more months before, and Covid has extended that to 2 years it looks like. But still, this is well more than halfway to full functionality as an adult, a car and decent, safe apartment, and a full time career. She took me more than halfway there essentially entirely on her own dime. 

She would have taken me the full distance, but her licensing body eventually told her my rate was actually too good, it was becoming unfair to her other clients. My situation was uniquely worse in practical terms than anyone else in her practice, which was why she did it and it was valid. But at a certain point its unfair, others may not be as poor as me, but people lose work, have families and responsibilities, and such. I can totally understand that. I am going to keep meeting with her monthly just to keep a base, which I can afford even at a more normal rate. There would have been a proper transition to an agency therapist, if not for the damned pandemic. But looks like a couple months with a bit of an empty patch for therapy. 

She will still be there though, I will have a session a month later, and the agency therapist will happen within a few months or so. So things just keep improving, just a bit tough right now, and stalled a little bit. But the pandemic is hitting everybody, its just one of those things, and the core progress towards an improved situation is still there. The therapist has helped me enormously, just gone out of her way to work within appropriate boundaries well also going out on a real limb for me. I am really incredibly grateful. Anyway thank you so much again for the kind words, it is really so nice, and means a lot to me. I hope so much you are good, your people are well and things are great hopefully, or at least okay. And I really hope your day can just be a beautiful one. :)"
CPTSD,fma7sjr,t1_fm9xnoy,1585886045.0,"Thanks so much, your understanding here is really great. To answer your question, I guess the hope is that the person reporting is doing so because they have highly compartmentalized the role of this community as apposed to others, or they do not actually see a 5 year plan as realistic but clicked on this thread anyway, and thought your reply a rule 1 issue. In that type of case I think this place has to be a foundation alone. Because your right, the same evidence base that shows pure person centered support to be valuable for PTSD also shows it is insufficient alone, in the vast bulk of cases. I like to think people are using this as a supplement to more rigorous therapy, or as a foundation before getting more rigorous therapy. 

Even in that case its maybe a bit rules lawyering in this case, you really were pretty darn reasonable. The reason we encourage any report at all, and the reason some survivors may report even when they feel it might be too small, is to push back against the idea of tattling, and to create a ""see something say something"" approach to things. That is the only logic to reporting your comment I can see, it was certainly not that it was even remotely glaring as a rule 1 issue. Also its important to remember that there are a lot of survivors here who are very early in recovery, or more pre-contemplative about recovery here. People who are in ongoing abuse, who have disabilities that place barriers to recovery, severe ongoing poverty, or addictions, or actively suicidal, and such. Considering our role and approach here it is not hard to see why we're popular with, and have a higher proportion of, more vulnerable trauma survivors. 

But we also have a large proportion, its still gotta be half and likely more than half, who are well into and at various stages of recovery. Some come more to help others, but even for themselves a pure support based place can have real value as a supplement to more rigorous therapy and recovery. I will tell you personally, it can work like that, speaking from the peer support perspective specifically. I am now 3 years into recovery at this point, and am doing better and better every day, and at this point am quite healthy externally, and doing consistently okay and better internally in any larger sense. But just over 2 years ago I was not there whatsoever. 2+ years ago I was putting posts up ranting and threatening suicide, and that is the truth. I utilized this place appropriately. 

I had no real emotional supports in my life, and was in ongoing abuse. Until 18 months ago I was not sober, and had been doing harm reduction for 1 year before I got there. I took the emotional food as it were from this place, and then used that in finding and keeping and working in a real way with more rigorous therapeutic supports. It was precisely what I needed initially, and later I could see the limitations of that. I do know for a fact this place can work that way. I do not tell my story nearly so often at all, and of course all serious trauma is the same, but it is as a factual matter some of the most stereotypical, deeply lurid overt abuse, extreme poverty, ghetto bullshit imaginable. 

All the autism, and erudite pseudo academic manner of speaking self taught from libraries does not change just how shady, inherently criminal, chaotic, and simply brutal in a very overt way the events of my childhood were, and the fact I hid and internalized it as a result of the autism it does not change how self destructive and emotionally dysregulated I was prior to therapy, sobriety, and recovery. This community was the main, in real ways sole, foundation to that. I have been a moderator for just over a year now, and in truth I am considered quite good at it. I compartmentalize extremely well, and am protective of our role, because I have seen it help me and so many. 

Its notable I believe that in the just over 1 year I have been moderator this community has grown from 14 to 62 thousand. Not because of me of course. But overall we found a real role. There was not and is not another trauma support community on the internet at all that takes the person centered pure support idea as seriously as we do, and that is fulfilling a clear need. This sort of pure support community absolutely can work, if one takes it for what it is, works on themselves in a real way, and finds those other forms of help that are eventually going to be vital to moving forward. I have been here a while, and moderating over a year. 

The large majority of people do use this place appropriately. They may seem unlike it, early on when their still venting, but mostly they truly are trying. There likely is a small minority, 5 or 10 percent say, who are just soaking up validation and not putting in work to change. So be it I say. More aren't, quite a bit so, I am as certain as I can be about that. And even with those people, so be it. Their severe trauma survivors in the end, most of them serious child abuse survivors, with more severity being present largely based upon CSA, cults, overt sadism, and such. If this is all that can be given to those survivors that is worth doing in my view. 

And maybe, probably given enough time, they will get there too. But then believing that is just me, this place is a pure as is reasonable and possible within the rules, I personally am as purist a Rogersian as essentially anyone, I have to believe that. But if in that case we are enabling that minority I would argue they will find that somewhere no matter what. Regardless, this place is doing a lot for people, and really can be utilized in a way that helps people change and improve is major ways. That all being said I reaffirm your basic point. If this place is all one has their welcome here. But I hope very much they get more. We need more as survivors. If one thinks this sort of purely compassion based stuff can lead to complete and linear recovery they are almost certainly mistaken. Its an entirely valid, important point to make. In any case, if you made it this far I do hope you forgive the length of this. That is the full defense and advertisement for this community and its values though. I do hope it makes sense."
CPTSD,fm9xpmr,t3_ftya4i,1585878935.0,"I am just so sorry your going through this. I don't think your wrong to feel this way at all. If your feeling better and healthier now it seems only reasonable you would like to continue to feel that way. Your not wrong to feel anxious at all. I do not see why we are not entitled to our own worries. Your a severe trauma survivor, its only natural to worry and get anxious or depressed. I personally am in a different position, but think I get the fear and anxiety a great deal. I just sent a close friend a letter voicing my feelings about this crisis that I have not explained to anyone up until this point, because I want to remain strong and hopeful for others during this. But I am becoming deeply, deeply worried that this is the calm before the storm, that there will be no returning to normal, and that the wheels have fallen off civilization entirely and we are careening headlong into the gutter. 

I can make some extremely coherent, well thought out arguments in favor of that, that the next steps are a path to either complete anarchy or dictatorship. That all sounded so true in my head when I wrote that letter, for two weeks I have spoken nothing of it to anyone, and I believe it utterly at an emotional level. But that does not change that its a fear, and all my bookishness and erudite framing in the world does not make my fear an accurate prediction of the future. The truth is I am allowed to be afraid, and so are you. I personally hate this time enormously. The isolating, the restrictions, its horrible to me. Yet I was not always in this position, and 6 or 8 years ago I was a very quiet and isolating survivor like yourself and many here. 

Now I am not. So its only natural I dislike this time, I have lost a great deal of things that were valuable and helpful to me. Yet you have really not, what you have lost is stress, and burdens, and abuses in this time. Your not wrong here, at all. And I do not think I am. Its so easy to say in these communities, but so hard to internalize. But your, and my, and all our emotions are utterly and completely valid, without exception, in and of themselves. I don't care what they are, how dark, their feelings and thoughts and nothing more, and their just not wrong ever unless we hurt someone by acting on them. Which clearly your not doing at all, and are a great person. 

I just worry we're beating ourselves up. This is a really bad time, a true crisis that on this scale, and of this type, has barely been seen within living memory. I wish so much I had better words. But you deserve only compassion and empathy and care. I hope you continue to enjoy this time, in truth its the only bright spot I see that so many survivors are getting so much from this. And I hope that when things do return, and despite my fear and my intellectualizing of that fear it likely will, you can just find life holds onto some of the good that came to you and others from this, and that things only keep improving. Goodness knows you deserve it, an goodness knows that even if its tough on me and others you deserve this reprieve, just very much so."
CPTSD,fm9u8gk,t1_fm8wy3z,1585876689.0,"Hey, I am a moderator. I am not going to remove this. But I just wanted to mention this because its important. This was reported as a rule 1 issue. Overall I just don't think it is, its not far enough at all, and its in a thread asking for interpretation, and you give interpretation, indeed really solid stuff that is generally a pretty clear consensus amongst trauma therapists. And its overall not unkindly written at all, and that is pretty clear. But I have to give a heads up about that first sentence, ""lol"", and criticizing other survivors conceptions of what healing means to them. Very gently, but criticizing nonetheless. Its not that that would  be inappropriate in many contexts or communities, therapeutic or otherwise. But this community is a pure person centered support community. 

I mean this is the internet, and Reddit, some resiliency is needed here, and we do remind people of that if they were expecting perfection on this. I admit a pure Rogersian, person centered place in an absolute sense is impossible in that context. But we try, we try quite hard, to make that as pure as possible. Pure person centered peer support communities, either as a foundation for recovery or as a complement to other therapeutic help, has an excellent evidence base for PTSD. And its not like there are not lots of other recovery communities that are far more open to debate, confrontation, and such. 

We're actually kind of unique in how purely we try to take that here. I just explain all that to make it clear you did nothing wrong really, not in any larger sense at all, its just this community's role that is the issue. As much as possible pure person centered peer support. In its own way it is rigid of a modality, or in this context more a framework, and I am sorry for the invalidation that understandably sometimes causes. Its just our role here. I would not have thought it enough to bring up if it was not reported, but when it hurt or bothered someone I had to mention it. Its not a big deal overall at all, and I do hope you feel only welcome here. I really hope you understand."
CPTSD,fm5ss71,t3_ft8d09,1585779233.0,"No, you are doing nothing wrong. Your feelings are valid no matter what, without exception, only if your emotional disconnect translates into actions that harm others is it an issue. This is a normal response to trauma, abuse and CPTSD, to have a blocking or deadening of emotional feelings that do not directly affect the survivor personally. I myself think of those affected by this situation who are alive more than anything. Those dying of it without visits, the elderly in nursing homes without visits, the developmentally disabled who need direct care and cannot really understand this at all, and such. I hated medical people entirely so, so much for so many years due to long term institutional abuse as a small child, but this has to be a hellish situation for them, and I admire and am grateful for medical people more than I ever have been in my life. More than anything I think of those living in abuse, especially the children, and in particular those too young to use support communities like this. 

I have been sobbing and having panic attacks several times a day over that. School was their reprieve from the abuse, and school the only place likely to ever see what was going on and step in. That is gutting me. But the dead are harder for me to feel. Even the families, I feel horrible for them, but in the end they now have a normal path of grieving and moving forward as with any death. A person can only absorb so much, and I feel no more or less for the dead and their loved ones than I did for any other large natural disaster scenario. I feel no fear of the virus itself, or even concern personally. 

I obey all these restrictions because I care about and respect others, objectively its clearly a real threat, people are genuinely frightened, and I am happy to do what is needed to do my part. But I feel nothing about the virus specifically, just the harm its causing living people and society as a whole. Emotionally I am more concerned with the vulnerable, and how the restrictions are affecting them, things would have to get far worse before I could feel them as comparable. I know that is wrong, the rate this spreads and the death levels have been made clear to me, but deep in my heart I care more about the kid now trapped with their sexual abuser than I ever will about the death rate. I do get we cannot work under that premise at all, I do. 

But for myself, personally, I would rather we all get the damned virus and bury the 1 percent of the population and sadly move on than to think how this is affecting some people. That is a purely emotional reaction. But I feel it a great deal. I have been sobbing and having panic attacks several times a day thinking of that. But in truth I feel nothing when I see the body bags, nothing at all. When I see dead my emotions become as they are. I have not been to a funeral in a decade, I disconnect so much from emotion with death I am not helpful to the family, and have not been able to process or grieve death in many years. 

I do not fear it in the end, and its hard to feel strongly about it with others. I would actually feel a lot more for someone if they were grieving 6 months or a year later, that has become serious, but for the first while it just seems right and normal they grieve, I feel more grateful for them that they are still capable of it. None of this is wrong. My emotions, your emotions, anyone's, their always valid without exception. This sort of response is normal with CPTSD, a burning out of certain fear and grief responses, others growing too strong, and an inability to process some types of trauma in the world. If ones acts on them that is an issue. But feelings themselves are valid, they matter, and with complex trauma all manner of disconnects and increased sensitivity in all sorts of combinations is entirely normal."
CPTSD,fm5mlal,t3_ft47g2,1585775787.0,"Hello, I am a moderator, and have to remove this. I would normally attempt to explain how deeply problematic this is at a multitude of levels, but do not see the purpose, others have already said all that is needed. Just briefly I will say that sex is absolutely not required to be a healthy and happy person at all, and if it is a serious worry for you the only thing that helps the fundamental issues here is therapy. Outside that this is a rule 6 issue in the end, without question. This is not a dating site, of which there are many, this is a support community for PTSD survivors. You do not mention CPTSD or anything specifically at all, but you clearly had a lot of trauma, and I am getting a strong vibe you do not see the problem here, and I will assume good faith. 

But surely you can see how, on a PTSD support forum with many rape and child sexual abuse survivors, a post from an older man asking for random sexually available young woman just barely into adulthood is triggering, and wildly inappropriate. If the trauma made you unaware of that I can get that. But I am telling you now, anything remotely like this will be removed in essentially any community like this really at all. This really is a place for survivors to share their lived experience, and I will let this go at this point. But this is beyond the pale, the next step is a temp ban. I really hope you understand."

CPTSD,fm2t0tv,t3_fsp405,1585704745.0,"This is such an important thing, and so easy to minimize or deny in real life. It may be a different underlying need than what is on the surface, they may be genuine in feeling bad about it, and sometimes abuse can be understandable even though its never defensible. But their doing it for some reason. This speaks so much to me. I blamed other things for so many years, largely the same things the abusers blamed. My mother was the best example. She had as good of excuses for how she got here, and the sheer stress and difficulty in the moment, that I saw her as a long suffering survivor entirely. Indeed I called her a saint for many years. I never once reflected on my anger though, or how I said that. 

Because for nearly 20 years I called her a ""goddamned saint"". But I use more plain terminology and profanity in real life than here, and that was not sarcastic, it was just how I spoke, and is how others took it. It was at 36 in therapy I realized I had not called her that without the specific extra term every time without exception for 15 years anyway when I spoke to her. And towards her directly I stopped calling her mom, which she prefers, and started calling her ma at 20 or so, which she hated. I truly thought I just preferred it, and certainly her and others used nicknames without considering others feelings all the time, so I just kept doing it until she wore down and accepted it. 

But I truly believed it was valid and true for so long, that my ma was a goddamned saint. She was from an extremely abusive home, went into various foster homes, psych wards, and group homes at 11 until 17 in the 70's, and suffered indescribable abuse, then had me and married at that point to my father, a 22 year old who had served 5 years in jails and been a heroin addict 9 years when he met her, who she literally met as a patient in a psych ward. He was abusive, and she has 2 more kids in the next 4 years, and didn't divorce him for 12 years. But the second husband was just as abusive. 

My father was kinder in some ways, and more angry than cruel, but he was more damaged and neglectful. The second husband was far higher functioning in some ways, but truly cruel and sadistic, and manipulative. She was with him for 6 years. Then she did a wrong thing that is the sort of weird, shitty, entirely wrong, and entirely understandable type of thing a survivor may do, which as fucked up as it is I saw as darkly admirable for a battered woman. What she did was realize she had to leave him finally, but wanted certain things. It was almost 6 years, and she had never pulled the trigger and married him. And he had moved her 2000 miles away from her family. 

So she stayed with him for months knowing she was leaving with promises of marriage, if he drove her across the country. But when she got back with him she decided to go through with it, still knowing she was leaving, and kept leading him on for 2 more months. She wanted the big fancy family wedding you see. Certainly my father did not give her it at 17, that was a judge and a nice restaurant. I had to give her away at that second wedding at 16, though he was my abuser as well and I was open in hating him, because her own father was simply too old. For so many years though I did not blame her consciously at all. I saw her as a victim entirely. 

But she did have intent, and reasons in the end. She was abusive and neglectful because of her own past trauma and hideous life in the moment of course, wildly chaotic and clearly mentally ill and lashing out, then feeling horrible. That is not where the intent came in though. The intent was never once seeking help. Because she did not want to lose us to the system, sure. She even had a good excuse there, her own abuse in care made her think it was too dangerous for kids. But she could have worked to get us back and such. She could have made any meaningful attempt at all to get us kids into non abusive families homes. 

There was not enough of that its true, and none that could take 3 kids, but between her and my father she could have found each of us a safe place, and keep us connected. But in the end her need was not to lose her kids no matter what was best for them. And the reason she did not go to a DV shelter was such places were quite pushy in the 80's and early 90's, and would say things she did not want to hear. In the end that was the reason. Everything else is just excuses. I do love her, and do see where it comes from. But nothing justifies it, and no matter how absolutely real and pure it is being abused does not make abusing children okay. This is such an enormously valuable point it took me so many years, therapy really was needed, to accept. I relate to it so much, and it means a lot to me. Thank you so much for sharing it, its really awesome. :)"
CPTSD,flzj7xl,t3_fp8etu,1585624986.0,"Hey. I just wanted to tell people about 2 new trauma support communities I have created. One is r/TraumaAndPolitics, which is for the intersection of trauma and political issues of essentially any kind. It is still a support environment, but is designed to have the sort of posts and discussions that in principle should be acceptable here, but in practice just do not fit in here. Pure support posts are allowed, self promotion posts are allowed, and well a purist free speech environment is impossible well still being a support community this is an attempt to create more of that sort of idea for complex trauma survivors.

Also there is r/CPTSDmusic, which just seemed an obvious enough idea I was surprised it had not been done yet. Both communities are growing consistently, r/TraumaAndPolitics at 140+ members at month 3 is growing well, and r/CPTSDmusic at 40+ members at just barely 2 months is moving along in a solid way. Just thought I would tell people if they had an interest. I hope things are well for everyone, or at least okay, and hope all your days can be just beautiful. :)"

My father was a lifelong heroin addict from 13, he and I lived together as adult roommates from 18 until I was 22, he was divorced from my mother and on welfare, and I was on disability for autism. I found him passed in the morning one day, he was 45 years old. It is just so terrible, and I am just so sorry your going through it. I wish I had some advice. I have empathy though, enormously, though I know its only so helpful at times. I get so much how much the pandemic is making things so hard. The mental health drop in center I attend and volunteer at is closed, the library is closed, the YMCA, everything, just getting food is turning into a trial. I get what you mean so much. I get how the social isolating is validating, or not a big deal to other survivors a lot, that only makes sense. 

But for me and I assume others its just really so tough. To have to return to your mothers house is just such a difficult situation. I just wish it was different, goodness knows you are worth and deserve that. But the work and sacrifice you are doing for your daughter and yourself is just really so amazing. Its inspiring and beautiful in truth. Your clearly doing so much, working so hard. I wish I had answers. But goodness knows I get it, and as much as empathy often helps only so much I feel what your going through a great deal I think. I wish so much I knew what to say exactly. I just hope things get better and improve just a great deal, as your are so clearly worth and deserve. :)"
