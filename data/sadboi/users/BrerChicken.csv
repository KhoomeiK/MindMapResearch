todayilearned,fq79jrq,t1_fq65tc6,1589143530.0,"> I have this theory that our modern number system is what ended the dark ages and allowed the Renaissance to happen. 

The numbering system itself had been around for a long time, much longer than the Renaissance. But mostly you're just making the same incorrect assumption about the Renaissance that every once else makes: that it somehow regained something. That's not what that was. It was a group of cultures that had not yet discovered how the world works for themselves, all of a sudden ""discovering"" it because they were exposed to ideas from the East. This was knowledge spreading from the Greeks, Persians, Egypt, Ancient India and China. This idea that Columbus discovered that the world was round is so wrong. All the major civilizations knew that except for the West, because it simply wasn't a major civilization and never had been. Rome and Greece are as close as they got, but only for a few dozen decades, nothing like the major civilizations everywhere else.

You don't have to judge her, but it's okay to explain that when she took him from school and fled the state, that was dangerous, and that she shouldn't have done that.

This is going to be really difficult for your son to deal with, but it's even more difficult if he has to push through layers of what's true and what isn't, and then he'll eventually have to go through it all again when he's older. You don't have to make her out to be a monster, but you really should be explaining things to him. You guys are a team, and you need to be able to trust each other.

I'm so sorry you're in this situation, it sounds like literal hell. Your son loves and needs his mom, and it's so sad that he can't be with her right now, but hopefully she'll get some help, and he'll be able to be with her again one day."
