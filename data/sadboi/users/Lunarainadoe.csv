family,fq5kpb8,t1_fq5fi2g,1589109079.0,"No you don't.  If you were stricken with post partum depression you could have just as well treated or baby like shit.  The brain is a very complex organ.  Should you also have been in a car accident sustaining brain damage, or developed a tumor in your brain to the frontal cortex, you would behave completely different and would be a completely different person.  There are many other extremely complex effects on human behavior that have yet to be determined.  Judging others or thinking you're a better parent just because you were lucky and had the perfect conditions to allow you to not inflict physical abuse on your child is great.  Judgement and assessment of cause and effect is important.  But your father didn't have that ability or suffered some sort of different purpose.  Biopsyhosocial.  Genes, (the warrior gene for example) epi-genetics, culture, anatomy, environment, hormones, societal norms, 5G, fuck it....  Everything has a a butterfly effect on our lives and our brains and behavior beyond what we know and scientists still can't define.  Choice is the illusion that one singular man behind the machine is pushing the levers of action.  The brain is composed of many parts most of which we have still no idea how they truly work and interact with each other.  And we don't know the higher order beyond brain and the forces of nature which are or true parents.  Nature and the unconscious rules you or whatever sense of you you believe exists.  'You' 'I' and them are all an infinity complex amalgamation if an infinit complex universe.  I'm glad the cycle of abuse has changed.  But just because it stopped with you doesn't mean nature didn't make the decision."

love,fp203xo,t3_gakloy,1588252247.0,"It could be my maladaptive programming during childhood.  Or something else more primal.  But romance doesn't turn me on specifically.  If I feel I am not desired or cared about um turned off.  But dirty talk, grunting, him smelling my panties, grabbing my ass, and taking control is what I prefer.  Feeling a man's masculine side, that deep sexual desire through the gaze in his eyes of him undressing me and dirty talk in my ear is what gets me wet.  Kinikness and ripping my clothes off is what gets me horny.  Now, for a lasting relationship, for that true love connection, romance or showing that he cares is essential.  I'm a female."

That means someone who only has missionary sex or through a sheet.  I like kinkiness with one partner, a husband I'm looking for at this point.  I like being submissive and want him to take the lead.  I can be a bit of a tomgirl and I don't mind in fact enjoy getting my hands dirty meaning I'm not very girly I don't get my nails done or wear dresses unless requested.  I like to garden and do physical things like hiking and explore."

JordanPeterson,fofxyjx,t1_fofaeuw,1587744766.0,"All of them basically.  His intelligence, honesty, composure, openness, wit, active forward moving energy, etc.  His belief in the family unit, his discipline, and strength ,  and confidence, and standing up for himself despite social pressure to not be authentic and true to himself.  He has an understanding of archetypes and is able to symbolically see them represented in everyday mainstream  life and media. Something which is very rare and almost every person I've met in my life. And something that I basically live by. I used to be a Freudian still am, because he is greatly discreded which I strongly disapprove of.  The fact that he basically is the trunk of psychoanalysis  and the study of human behavior through this psychology perspective.  Other psychoanalysis like Carl Jung are the branches that Grew From his Baseline understanding of the fundamentals of subconscious and unconscious human behavior. This being the most  basic of Duality and core of human existence and drive the sex drive and death drive.  Literally represented by  the character is Thanos in the biggest selling movie and of all time the Avengers. Not to mention his principles and ideas have been used  to great effect by the marketing and advertisement  industry. Anyway let me stop my ranting about defending Freud.  Carl Jung  yeah.  Even as a woman I have been inspired  and helped through my incredibly difficult journey to muster up  Herculean strength to get through my life. Although I wish he had a greater sense of humor.  I used to think he was too blunt and maybe not empathetic enough until I saw him crying during an event where a fan rushed on stage begging for his help.  It instantly made me respect him and fell in love with his soft little underbelly.  He seems to have mastered the balance."
JordanPeterson,fofxh8y,t1_fofcqxs,1587744528.0,"Unfortunately I suffer from social anxiety and PTSD so it'd hard for to go out there.  I guess none of us can now due to the quarantine.  I worked for a team of psychologist, majored in psychology at university but most of them were female and and of course on the job relationships are discouraged.  Social media and meet up groups are my place."
JordanPeterson,fofx5tf,t1_fofwlaq,1587744370.0,"Yes, I'm not religious but at this point I'm willing to set that aside and love unconditionally especially over minor differences such as religion.  I am very ungrounded and high in empathy, openness, agreeableness, neurotsism, etc. Which is why I've always been taken advantage of and abused.  Also, I'm creative, and mind in the clouds.  I need someone to keep me grounded.  A partner where we both come together in a perfect symbiosis to create the ideal union.  Well...  Not expecting perfection."
JordanPeterson,foful4o,t1_fofbct3,1587743091.0,"Yes a provider.  That's what men do best.  Women are supposed to be nurturers, loving, supportive, etc.  Ever heard of divine feminine and masculine traits.  I've had to embody both because of the lack of healthy responsible suitable to date men out there.  Honestly, I'm mentally strong as fuck after the extreme trauma I've been though.  I'm ready for a partner that actually offers support and is able to pull his weight in the masculine department because I lack the skills and training, penis, testosterone, and Y genes to be a man.  Do you actually listen to it absorb Jordan Peterson's lectures? This is exactly the point he makes. Thousands upon thousands of years rooted in genetics, epigenetics, culture, Etc has endowed men and women with specific skill sets and abilities. Or are you one of those people that think Jordan Peterson supports lazy, unmotivated men who dodge out on their responsibilities? As a woman I am aware of my responsibilities and mind you I have absorbed a lot of toxic masculinity. I am and have been a caretaker, a nurturer, and have worked in the medical field which requires a greater amount of empathy and compassion. Not to mention patience. LOL. Something my one male coworker failed miserably at.  Of course if someone's is suffering from mental illness, physical disability, Etc exceptions are understandable. Just for your information I was in a 10-year relationship with an alcoholic at where I was the primary provider.  Yet I still cooked and cleaned for him, have him the best fucking blow jobs and sex.  Supported him emotionally and loved him while he cheated on me while he drove around in my car buying his drug supplies.  Supported him and went to his N/A meetings with him.  Anyway, you're free to do whatever you want however I am looking for what I am looking for and I have every right to be. And that's why I appreciate Jordan Peterson so much. He is trying to make men become but they were meant to be. And yes that is providers. We are the nurturers we are the heart. A man makes a house, a woman makes it a home.  P. S.  Men do not want an independent woman. In fact the more independent and successful a woman is the lower her options for partners becomes. Men want women that are submissive, make less than they do, and generally have less power. Not to mention they like to perceive them as being less Intelligent. Studies have shown that this is the case. Look it up. Another professor I suggest who has his entire series of lectures on YouTube is dr. Robert sapolsky. He is not a clinical psychologist but is a neurobiologist, primatologist, and the leader and Endocrinology particularly dealing with the stress response. He's a professor at Stanford University.  He is incredibly engaging. If you are a fan of Joe Rogan there is an interview with him where they speak about Toxoplasmosis.  And for the record I don't care and have literally lived in a tent just to be with one of my former partners. It's not about where we live it's about a man being a man and being a provider. And me doing my job being supportive and providing and doing what I was meant to do as a woman. Not saying this is universal everyone's free to do and be whatever they want. This is just my personal desire. You can attack me all you like but when it comes down to it the facts on my side. And Jordan Peterson as well."

Empaths,flnte6s,t1_fjl8ut6,1585325515.0,"What you said makes no sense.  A psychopath does the exact opposite and discloses as little personal information as possible, and what they do tell is usually lies.  They would never leave themselves vulnerable unless it was a strategic tactic and of course it would mostly be 90% lies to get something they are after.  They would wait for you to speak first, analyze you, and make up whatever they feel would best able them to manipulate you.  Being secretive also shows a sign that you have something to hide, shame, or guilt.  Or are just a boring person with nothing interesting to say."
Empaths,flnstnn,t1_fjk3pcm,1585325202.0,"By opening up to other people quickly, I've healed strangers from long kept secret traumas they held onto for years.  Because I told my story open and honestly.  This has happened mutiple times with people I just met.  It creates space for others to let go of things they have held bottled up for decades.  They think, well, if she is so open and honest maybe I can finally tell someone I'm gay, or was molested, or tried to kill myself.  I listen, comfort, and empathize when hearing these sometimes very disturbing stories they tell.  So it's a mutual healing.  It seems to happen naturally sometimes.

Fuck that shit....

I love myself now, Im fucking awesome.  It's the people that are turned off by honesty and hearing about a person's personal life that are shut off and emotionally unavailable.  No thanks....

Mostly narcissist that don't want to give to others or selfish people who serve no purpose in the world.  I have a lot of love to give.  Lots of it, and it's not my fault that people feel unworthy of my love and can't accept it.  This is the secret to humanity.  I'm not the one with low self esteem. Think about it, what purpose is there for any type of relationship if no one needs anyone.  Those who don't want to be needed or don't want others who need them are essentially useless to humanity and may as well not exist. Think about it evolutionary wise.  What use does someone like this serve to humanity?  Sure they can work in the arts, science. Etc. But even those fields, everything that exists is needy.  Artist need  admirers to buy their Works. Scientists need  funding and other scientists to  support their work. This is a world where everyone and everything needs something or someone.  And none greater than human companionship and human  emotional needs.  I have alot to offer.  If someone doesnt appreciate that it's on them and its THEIR loss.  We all need to be wanted by something. You have a need to be heard or else you wouldn't have posted on this comment. Or exact have Reddit account at all. All the people on Facebook have a need to be heard. Don't get me started on Instagram models. Or else you get nilism, existential crisis, meaninglessness, and purposelessness. Places in which I've visited and no place anyone would want to reside.  And the same folks you're talkin about, when they get old they will become needy. Should the nurses and family members be repulsed and reject them for their neediness of need to be taken care of? What kind of world would that be? Who would want to live in a place like that? Certainly not me. I have a desire to be wanted desired and needed for what I have to offer.  I have needs to be loved.  And I cannot make love to myself physically.  People aren't perfect and I know that.  I know a partner May that detail may screw up but that's part of the beauty of unconditional love. Whether or not people are capable of this it is  still want and desire  everybody has whether they admit it or not. No man is an island upon himself. No man in fact is no man. We are products of Nature and it is in our nature as humans to want to feel needed, wanted, desired, appreciated, Etc. Why do you think there is no epidemic of loneliness? Suicides through the roof? The whole woman's movement of I'm independent and don't need a man it's a big fat lie. Children are now getting their nurturing and education through the internet. We need companionship we need people and we need relationships. And a story. Anyone that says otherwise it's most likely a narcissist or psychopath. Those are the ones I don't want to give but just want to take.  This new idea of not needing people in this new generation as a result I believe of Technology. And trust me, the breakdown of the family unit will be felt in later years.  We already see it but the Overflow and epidemic of narcissist roaming the lands."

energy_work,fir1cuo,t1_fipl6xd,1582655412.0,No...  Its not narcissism.  It's more like being trapped in the godhead mind.  When you realize your own power but get stuck in your own world.  More like the law of attraction run amuck and too narrowly focused.  The universe revolves around you because you are trapped in your own head so the external world manifests things in your environment and whatever you focus on.  The higher the vibration the faster the manifestations.  Narcissists only think about themselves and do for themselves.  I'm an empath so I can't be a narcissist.  Its more protective bubble reality I think.  I've become so sensitive I can't stand certain things like violence and even seeing insects die hurts me.  It's like I live in my own little world because the old reality was too painful.  But it's lonely.  So lonely.

lawofattraction,fefedjm,t1_fe35oej,1579054534.0,Im over it.  I realized the nature of the situation.

Shamanism,fef4wv3,t3_eolhvv,1579048257.0,I'm a shaman that experiences anxiety and PTSD.  I clawed my way though the journey to make it where I am today.  Which is multi-dimensional.

Shamanism,fdx46sw,t1_fdtvm49,1578765142.0,I understand what you mean.  I have strong left brain coherence and am able to at least try to translate and interpret the seemingly impossible into metaphors and patterns.  I am dual brained.
Shamanism,fdx3t0o,t1_fdu2wwe,1578765011.0,You too.  When you pass the test while struggling with extra weight of mental illness it makes the victories even sweeter.

energy_work,fdx0x2b,t3_en8xmr,1578764198.0,"Guilt is useless most of thr time, as is shame.  Whoever, and whatever you feel guilt or shame about set the intent on gratitude instead.  If you hurt someone feel gratitude that you have empathy and a heart.  Or, gratitude for the universe for the lesson it taught you.  Focus on that.  Listen to gratitude meditation sir affirmations. 

This app called Let's Meditate is pretty good."
lawofattraction,fdwmcf1,t3_en43kj,1578760182.0,"The best technique is to remove the blocks that are preventing you from from believing in the first place.  Maladaptive belief systems.  I am manifesting so fast with things that I'm open to, others I have blocks with.  People make th rmistske of ranting things to come in a certain package.  Just go with the flow.  Accept what comes, show gratitude and more will come.  Most of all know that the universe knows what's best for you, if people get out of the way with their limitations on how they want what they want heich honestly is just to feel safe, secure, happy, loved, etc.   All of that comes from within and is projected externally.  That's the true secret."
Empaths,fdwjhia,t3_en3i26,1578759348.0,"I know how you feel.  I was just eating my vegan bacon with tomatos.  In this world there are many things that as empaths can cause use great pain.  You can either accept things as they are and imagine that their is a divine intelligence at work that understands and knows more about our world than we do and that everything despite of appearances are will be okay.  You can (if you aren't already) become a vegan and cook meals for others so that they can taste and see that natural whole foods direct from the earth are better.  If you are in good health and thye are overweight, they will be tempted to try your lifestyle.  This has worked for me.  You could also donate your money or time to animal rights organizations. 

In the meantime, as an empath, focusing on what is wrong with the world will make you miserable.  Be the change that you want to see in the world.  Focusing on such issues too much can bring you down and make you incapable of doing anything. I learned this regarding abortions.  I just can't even stand the thought of it so I don't focus on it."
Shamanism,fdsfrc9,t3_emxzkk,1578701761.0,"Being a Shaman is probably the most difficult of the mystic archetypes there are in our reality and the most ancient. Because shaman's are the ones that open the channels to nature, collectives, etc.  They were crucial to the community.  

My reality is a reflection of my inner world.  You are not alone.  There are thousands of us.  My thoughts increasingly are being projected outwards.  I keep being told I'm mentally ill even in the higher Realms of consciousness. ..  And maybe I am.  Its almosts as if i fly with a broken wing up to the gates of heaven and descend to the Underworld and back again to human reality all in a day.  Its a miracle!  But I'll tell you what.  I'm taking my mental illnesses if I can't heal them I will transmute them into strengths.  I was burned hard.  Hard.  Beyond anything I can describe.  I guess I'm the wounded healer archetype.  And by the grace of God I'm steering my ship though these uncharted territories, waves, and unseen landscapes and states of consciousness as gracefully as I can. Taking breaks when it is too much.  Never will I question my strength again.  I have the heart of a lion.  Soon, I will have the strength of a dragon once I believe I make it out of this or master what is seemingly psychosis to others.  I have sent out SOS's to God to save me and I have guidance from angels, or whatever higher powers that be.  I won't tell you that I don't often want out, but my internal world is so rich and...  Well...  I hope to eventually return to the middle world. It is not for the faint of heart or even the bravest.  Having mental disorders and still rocking this shit like... Well...  I think in order to be a shaman in this new world you have to break through a bit of crazy.  The world is kind of insane when you think about it.  But familiar.  I wouldn't recommend it but I certainly honor those who have walked the path.  It is almost like walking in the following in the footsteps of God. I just hope God isn't mentally ill.  Lol. Then, I'm sure God is beyond all that...

You can get on meds.  Even I use anti-psychotics as needed when I go too deep and know I am not ready.  Many people who take psyhcadelics experience the shamanic experience, but some of us experience it naturally.  The key is BALANCE.

I think the goal is maintaining stability in the earth bound realm.

Ground yourself, plant your feet in the ground."

lawofattraction,fcqnnbh,t3_eia56f,1577889166.0,"In my mind, undressed my ego self.  I stood with all that I am, what I stand for and what I had knowledge of.  With the boundary that I would not surrender my heart.  My heart...  I bore my being to the universe.  I asked to be given what I deserve whether it be blessings, balance, fairness, whatever it took to make make this world a better place for all conscious beings.  This wasn't bullshit, it came from my heart.  

I recieved 3 new psychic abilities within the last week.  I broke through the primary barrier holding things back from me.  Those barriers that remain the spirit world has vowed to remove out of my way.  I was told to sit back and relax my throne as I am a queen, and reap the rewards I so deserve.  I have not come this far to not reap what I now see as coming to me whether it has to drop down from the ceiling on my head.  I love myself and have the right to love myself and receive everything good the universe wants to give me.  I am ready to continue receiving good things."
