>By definition they wouldn't be the right person, because having kids is part of who they are.

A few people I know can't wrap their head around this.

A colleague of mine once asked if me and my current partner broke up and I met someone else but they had kids would that put me off. My reply was obviously yes.
They continued to ask, but what if that was the ONE you were meant to be with? 
If there is such a thing as ""the one"" they would most definitely not have children. 
Thank you for also having this mind set. It gives me faith that some people can actually use their brains."

CasualConversation,fpl9cp1,t3_gdz9sw,1588708660.0,"It sounds daft, but I'm going to write it anyway....

There is a entertainment company that is doing lots of stuff over the lockdown to help us get through it and to let us know they don't plan on slowing down.

They announced last night that one thing they want us to do is film ourselves doing our best impression of one of their actors and a scene or line of our choice.

Now, I adore this company. I've done my best to join in on their other activities. But this one, I cringe just thinking about attempting this. For one reason: I'd have to film myself doing it and then share my face on their social media. I hate having to check a photo and even opening the front camera makes me hate myself all the more.

Also, I've been learning how to French plait. It's coming along rather nicely, but I've managed to learn it without having to look in the mirror. Because.... Mirror....reflection.... No thank you.

Now, for me, this trip wasn't the best; I barely slept, I didn't really enjoy the activities and all I wanted to do was go home. But I remember for dinner one night there was a pasta option. I can't remember for the life of me unfortunately what type of pasta it was, but you were given grated cheese to sprinkle all over it (I have no idea what cheese it was either). I realise that it was just pasta and cheese and therefore probably not that appealing to everyone, but my GOD! It was the tastiest meal I've ever had.

As if that wasn't enough to hurt my heart, this girl made a post a few weeks ago.... asking about where can she get a kitten from, does anyone know of anyone selling them. 

I just got so angry. You've just given up a cat that you clearly loved very much judging by your previous posts. But now you want to get a kitten? Which would actually be more work because.... It's a kitten and needs to be at least house trained.
