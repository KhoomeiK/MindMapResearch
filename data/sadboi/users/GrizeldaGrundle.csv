Maybe it‚Äôs not definitively the singular best country in the world but it is a place that I feel so fortunate to be in. As an American, I have so much independence, freedom of thought, legal permission to dissent, freedom to marry who I choose, and educational opportunities. I can dress how I please and I am acutely aware, that if I were born in certain present-day countries (certain Muslim countries for example)I would be subject to execution should I criticize religion or regime. Additionally, just being born female in many places can lead to a tortured existence, full of oppression.

He feels he must trick her into thinking that she‚Äôs crazy and that she made a huge mistake. Like she ruined a chance at a fairy tale ending (I guess he figured Snow White would somehow end up falling for the Angry Dwarf and live happily ever after). He was driven to get PAYBACK (because she unintentionally bruised his fragile ego), so he relentlessly, rebuffed, jabbed, and taunted her in an effort to make her regret having independent thoughts.
