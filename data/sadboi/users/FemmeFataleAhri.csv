buffy,fdnkepb,t1_fdlwiym,1578587650.0,"She was rash, as most teens are. Granted everything was going to hell in a hand basket, but there could've been major repercussions (other than releasing Angelus, which is quite literally one of the worst). You gotta think of the double intention here. This show happened in the ninety/early 00s, when sex was very much taboo, and teens having sex was very very ignored. Buffy went through what most girls go through. She was in love, and Angel loved her, then lost his soul and became a giant tool (how some dudes literally just use a girl to get in her pants and then treat her like total garbage afterwards). They addressed this in a light  that shows that it wasn't her fault. Rash decision or other wise, she could not have predicted this outcome.

When Giles says rash I do believe he's meaning ""not thought out"" or ""heat of the moment"". What about protection? Did they use condoms? What if he had some mystical std (I mean aside from the whole soul thing)? How about some weird magical pregnancy? There were things that could've happened that could very well wrecked  Buffy's entire life, that all boiled down to the MAYBE  5 seconds she took to make a decision that could (and ultimately would) change her life forever. Instead of making her feel even worse about a split second decision, he reaffirmed her and made her feel loved and safe. Which speaks volumes, he addressed that yes, it was rash, but nothing is wrong with it doing it with someone you love and who you thought loved you."
