I work part-time; I can't do full time. I see people in all the time who have fibro or other issues and I know that these things hit people differently but I always end up comparing myself to the more functional crowd. It weighs on me. When people make those ""well it doesn't stop MEEEE/THEMMMM"" it just compounds so much of the trauma of childhood (father emotionally abused and neglected me) even on top of what disability can do to a person emotionally. Luckily, no one does it too overtly, just subtly enough that I can hash it out in therapy.

Imho it's a fairly relaxed religion, with just enough structure and lots of community. There's a big difference between what we do as a religious group and what people do and believe at home. If you aren't 100% sold on some concepts, no one is going to shun you or try to police your thoughts.

Personally, my advice to everyone is to try the beginner's class and see for yourself. Give things a chance, and if it doesn't feel right, there's no pressure to stay or anything. We know and acknowledge that KO isn't the end-all-be-all of Kemetic practices.

For me, structure and community were the reasons I stay. I went to the Wep Ronpet gathering in 2019 and it was so fun. Very kind group of people and I've made some treasured friendships.

ptsd,fi78ibc,t3_f6py1s,1582216449.0,"Hey there! I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. It sucks.

Personally, this is what I found works for me:

1.) **Medication**. Medication was a godsend when I first started on it. It gave me space between myself and my emotions, though not to the point of being zombified. Not everyone responds to medication the same way, and sometimes it takes a long time to figure out what's best for you, but I got lucky on the first try with sertraline (Zoloft). 

2.) **Visualization**. I do a lot of visualization in my religious practices, and it translated well to my mental health practices. I often visualize myself pushing the thought away, far, far away, until it doesn't come back. Or, if its particularly pesky, I bundle it up and put it in my ""box,"" until I am in a safe place to open the box and examine the thoughts inside (you don't want to leave them there). Therapy is a good safe place for that.

3.) **Mindfulness and grounding**. It's hard at first, but getting yourself in the moment can get you through an episode. I'm sure you've heard the ""name five things you can see, four things you can smell, etc etc"" thing, but also going back to visualizing yourself being rooted to the ground and the thoughts like lightning; since you're ""grounded"" by your roots, the lightning is harmless. Taking a walk and describing what's around you, what you are doing, etc, in great detail is a good form of mindfulness too.

4.) **Reframing**. This one took a while to implement, and even now can be hard to do, but it does work for me. Every negative thought that comes through -- let's take ""I am a piece of shit that deserves to be treated like crap"" for an example, because that often comes to me too -- and reframe it to something less harmful: ""I am entitled to every basic human right as another person by virtue of being a living, breathing human being."" It works best if you do this constantly instead of during an episode. For one, the more you do it and practice it, the less episodes you'll have, and two, it becomes easily to do during an episode. 

5.) **Knowledge**. Arm yourself with the knowledge of what your symptoms are, and why they happen. I find for me personally that technical terms help. When I identify what is happening to me in that moment, it's like I have more control of the situation, that I'm not as at the mercy of my emotions constantly.

I hope this helps. Good luck. Try to have some resources on hand like a number for a ""warm"" line; your therapist might have a list."

The Original Sin is not fallen angels and humans mating, but Adam and Eve eating the fruit from the Tree of Knowledge. It was the first sin, and the cause of humanity being born sinful. According to the story, it was Adam and Eve's sin that has damned the entire human race until Christ came and redeemed us.

I was specifically responding to /u/fuglybear 's question of

>So there were no 1 year old children who died in the flood? What ""sins"" were they guilty of?<

The sin that children are guilty of is Original Sin, the sin that all humanity is burdened of, until baptized and redeemed through Christ.

For the record, I do not believe in this myself; I have converted out of Christianity, but I have a Christian fiance and we discuss theology all the time.

I know of the race of fallen angel/human hybrids, but they have little to do with Original Sin, or The Flood, or babies being born sinful.

Oh, and by the way, Original Sin is what the Virgin Mary was born without due to the Immaculate Conception (erroneously contributed to Christ). It is why she was considered as the suitable vessel to bear Christ."

It, though Its many Names, can cause isfet even unintentionally, but the real reason that isfet exists is ~~The Uncreated One~~.>!1!< All suffering is through It, not Netjer, and the Names battle it daily to keep it at bay. 

Isfet, entropy, uncreation -- that's what causes death, destruction, disease, suffering. It was never meant by Netjer to happen, nor was it Netjer's ""plan"" in the same sense that is often attributed to Christianty's God. It is neither Netjer's nor humanity's doing, but rose up in response to Creation, and it's our duty to help keep it back.

At least, that's a simplistic version, as I understand it (not a member of the priesthood nor speaking in an official capacity, just my own understanding).

It honestly sounds like the Big Bang vs the Heat-Death of the universe, which is one reason why it makes sense to me in the broadest definition.

I doubt you'd anger Them at all by offering worship for a trial period if you're unsure kemetic polytheism is right for you. They're a welcoming bunch (mostly), and while of course They are gods, They can be very understanding.

You are NTA, and it sucks that he didn't get to see his daughter being born, but the comfort of the person giving birth is the most important thing, beyond anyone else's wishes. I just am baffled that he can't see that. It's like if he was getting a colonoscopy and in walks in his father in law how wants to be there in case its cancer, but he didn't want that and you refused to comply.

There was literally no way you had any agency, no way you could get up and walk away. You *begged* him, and he fucking refused?!

I am so angry. Their desires do not trump your bodily comfort.

You are NTA, and HE is 100% and more."

He was the first Netjeru I met, and the One Who has never left my side. He helped me re-learn how to drive while recovering from abuse. In fact, He's been by my side while I heal from so much abuse in my life.

I know with some He can be tough, but He's been nothing but gentle with me, if occasionally firm. He has shown me how strong of a person I really am; He has shown me how to endure the mental and physical pain that dominate my life. He has taught me to keep going and be too stubborn to give up.

I love Him so much I can't begin to explain. In any case, He is amazing and I hope you have a wonderful and positive relationship with Him."

I say this as both a victim that told myself that for years and a mother to daughter. *None of this is your fault.* Your mother is right to put her daughter first. You were right to tell her. The person, in this case, that is at fault is the person who hurt you, fullstop.

I know it feels like everything is broken now, but before nothing was unbroken; the broken bits were just wrapped up. And it hurts more to unwrap it all and start to heal but it is good an necessary. And not one iota is on you.

Good luck, much love, and heal well."

I was told so much through childhood that I was overexaggerating, that I was a wimp, a drama queen, too sensitive, etc that it makes it very difficult to come to terms with it. And even as I am, I still can't get rid of those negative thoughts, and it poisons my body-image. I'm overweight now, walk with a cane, and can barely work let alone do anything at home. Except for work or the occasional family function, I stay home. I seem to see doctors nearly every week. I can't even go grocery shopping 

Believe me, I get it. But please, please remind yourself that you are a human being entitled to compassion and empathy and self-love. You are worthy, even when your own brain turns on you. You are amazing in every breath you draw, because it's one more breath.

Tell yourself the same things you would tell a friend going through the same, because you need to be your own friend.

AmItheAsshole,fdd0dzs,t1_fdbrdgx,1578289874.0,"Agreed, you put it wonderfully. I am both physically and mentally disabled, but that doesn't mean I'm off the hook for my behavior, even on my bad days.

On the other hand, telling someone their disability doesn't matter can cut incredibly deeply. For me personally, I struggle with needing accommodations with my disability, or even accepting my disability as a disability. I can't ascribe similar struggles to this girl, but I know if it was me, that would put me in a very bad way mentally. And a lot of times when one is physically disabled, anxiety and depression can loom large in their lives. Again, nothing excuses her behavior, but compassion goes a long way even as you stand up for yourself.

You put it beautifully -- ""Being disabled doesn't give you the right to act this way"" is the perfect response. It makes her accountable without invalidating her disability or struggles with it."
ptsd,fdaz15p,t1_fdadqvf,1578251988.0,"No, it's more like two separate symptoms can pop up within a month of the trauma, and after your brain starts experiencing these two symptoms they begin to link together.

So you can start to have fear conditioning in the first month after the trauma, and then as your brain wraps itself around that reaction, depression sets in. The reverse can happen, too. Eventually, the two intertwine and cannot be separated after a while.

At least, that's how I understand it."

I would love for one day it would be normal in our society for co-ed sleepovers. In some countries, it is.

For me to agree to it, I would want a lot more information. I would need to know the parents, what they would be doing, where everyone would sleep, all the boys who are going there and their parents, if alcohol would be accessible, and more.

I've seen too much violence towards teen girls to fully be on board with a situation like this. It's not a matter of trusting my daughter, but not trusting a lot of other things, things I have experienced myself as a 31 year old woman.

I don't doubt you are mature enough for it -- you seem to have a good head on your shoulders -- but there's a difference between maturity and wisdom that comes with age.

I hope you can understand, and honestly my heart goes out to you and I just wanna give you a big hug, because I can just feel your hurt in your words."

Uh-uh, total asshole move on his part. You are growing a human being; he should be rubbing your back, feet, and whatever the hell else you want rubbed. 

Pregnancy is fucking hard on a body even when everything is going well. *Your muscles are literally tearing themselves apart so you can grow his child*, he should be much more accommodating to you, not just flopping out his dick with the expectation of an orgasm.

Get therapy. Losing him suddenly must be so hard on you, and finding this out must make it worse. You're probably hurting in so many ways right now. But your children should not bear that hurt. As parents, it's our duty to bear it for them.

Eventually, it might be a good thing to clear the air, but what ever else, he was a good dad to them, and they don't need this at such a hard time right now.

Go get therapy so you can process this in a healthy way without involving your children in it.

AmItheAsshole,fc6l0wv,t3_egdo8l,1577483083.0,"This hits a bit close to home for me, as my ex left me and my daughter and another man, my fiance, stepped up.

You are NTA. You are not abusing your daughter. You are not alienating the other parent.

There is room in her life for two daddies and two mommies. She gets double the love, double the parents who care for her and raise her. Unless there are manipulation and games between the co-parents, this is not a bad thing.

If you aren't forcing her or using it as a way to hurt your ex, it's not a bad thing.  

Your ex is probably insecure about it, and this might be a good time to find a family mediator. Handling this yourself  would be difficult, as your ex is going to see this as a threat to his parenting when it's from you, and frankly it's not your job to worry about his insecurity. It is, however, your job to worry about a good co-parenting relationship, and a professional family mediator can help that. Offer to find one *with* him that can help the four of you navigate this tricky process.

I never forced my daughter to call my fiance daddy, but she did eventually. Sometimes she goes back and forth, and she knows he's not her biological father, but a chosen father. He even asked her permission to propose to me.

I hope you find a healthy way forward through all of this. Good luck."

There were definite highs and lows for me, but I can see how it would appeal to others, you know? And so that's my peace with it. I'm not angry, JJ/Rian/Kathleen/Disney didn't ruin Star Wars for me. 

And in addition to what others are saying in the thread: it's not that you can't talk about it and critique it, but there's a difference between critiquing and discussion and whining/ranting/venting. 

The latter is simply toxic, and while no, no one is going to change my mind about how I feel about Star Wars, there gets a point when the melodramatic declarations gets stifling. If every discussion on things devolves into ""This sucks objectively and things are RUINED!"" and trashing the actual human beings behind it all is just not healthy, productive, or welcoming to others.
