Hence ""no one can deflect the emerald splash"" being incorrect as well as ""no stand can create a whole dimension"" also being incorrect. Against DIO joseph also had to remind him not to make assumptions about DIO's stand, as he was getting risky in the car-chase scene.

The Business group was always going to lose from a viewers standpoint, so those might have been dull unless you like Light and L working together (which I don't especially). In my opinion it picks up when my favorite characters, mello and near, join in as it switches back to Light being both perfectly confident in his plan as well as taken aback by the fact that he isn't invincible."
