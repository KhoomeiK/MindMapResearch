She is now worried about age difference & leaving him for his young golf buddy. I say karma paid a visit!"

amiugly,fbhf8wd,t1_fbh7062,1576872250.0,Iâ€™m new to this.....how do I view other pics? I only see the main one & Iâ€™ve  clicked on it & donâ€™t see the ones that others are referring too!
depression,fag284o,t3_e8wf5e,1576038035.0,Im in the same boat. As much as I want to be alone. It gets lonely. It slowly eats away at you. After work I canâ€™t wait to go home & isolate ( Iâ€™m a hairdresser & talk all day)  i go home & isolate with my lifetime movies. My daughter is  15 & doesnâ€™t wanna hang with me lol ....Iâ€™m stuck in such a routine....that I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™d invite anyone else dating wise into my life because it would take so much energy to come home from work & get ready for a date. But anyway.....Happy Birthday to you & I hope something sparks a little joy in your life this year!
amIuglyBrutallyHonest,f9wkfbs,t3_e6fycm,1575694072.0,Very handsome. Without the glasses youâ€™d look even better!
amIuglyBrutallyHonest,f9wjycq,t3_e6lv01,1575693850.0,"No. I would just get a lower haircut (Iâ€™m a hairdresser)
You have a long face so any extra height on the head is not needed."
amIuglyBrutallyHonest,f9whtj9,t1_f9wfwow,1575692863.0,I am cackling so hard right now! ðŸ˜‚
depression,f9t2tzm,t3_e6oybu,1575607071.0,"This is my exact life right now. I mentally make notes of what i want to get done on my day off....but then It takes me all day to get one thing done because i do it in increments & sleep in between. Then I beat myself down over it & feel even worse. 
I cried on way to grocery store today. Even envisioned stepping on gas full speed, crash & end it. If it werenâ€™t for my daughter, Iâ€™d do it."
amiugly,f9lvhzc,t1_f9ix6j2,1575433133.0,"Iâ€™m new to reddit so just curious as to where do I find her other pics? Like the body pics you are referring to? 
I only see 3 face pics lol"
amiugly,f9lr15v,t1_f9lee6e,1575429805.0,All your comments are cracking me up !ðŸ˜‚
amiugly,f9lpa4n,t3_e5fz4x,1575428582.0,"You have awesome features but those glasses distract from it alI, as well as the draggy hair. Im a hairdresser & I must say that a nice haircut will spruce you right up!  I also agree with the others. I know you want a beard, but itâ€™s literally just sprouts of hair in random areas. 
Follow those suggestions & your handsome self will look fresh."
amiugly,f9lnt0i,t3_e5rkxv,1575427573.0,"You are very handsome. TBH, your better off cutting ties because there is way too much temptation in college & being so far apart....it would drive you insane to think about that."
