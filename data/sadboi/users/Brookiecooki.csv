unpopularopinion,f60hz1c,t1_f5zpoen,1572617733.0,No it wasn’t because I had already asked for a raise 2 months before she got there
unpopularopinion,f5wjtmd,t1_f5w9u5v,1572525396.0,"So it’s a restaurant, she’s working on the production side which usually earns more than the service side. I’ve worked both sides in every single position for 3 years full time. She’s only starting on one single position on the production side. In what world would it make sense for her to make more than me??"
unpopularopinion,f5vfqan,t1_f5ve5k4,1572488351.0,"My reason is that I shouldn’t be making a little bit above minimum wage when I know every single position, and I mean EVERY single position and have 3+ years of experience working full time. And when I’ve asked for a raise in the past it was made out to be something that had to be discussed with higher ups, but in reality it’s the click of a button. Not only that but I was completely blown off. I would admit it if I was a mediocre employee and thought I didn’t deserve it, trust me, I deserve it."
unpopularopinion,f5vfdpp,t1_f5vc4c2,1572488177.0,"She started at the higher hourly wage than amazing reliable employees who’ve been showing up for 10 years and doing their jobs with integrity every single day. Now granted they might not be fighting for a huge raise, but I think that’s because they don’t even think it’s a possibility. That’s it’s just not something that happens with this sort of job, which is not true."
unpopularopinion,f5v1fjp,t1_f5v0ukd,1572482311.0,"Even in the past when I’ve asked about getting a raise, I was blown off because it was always something that they had to talk to some “higher up” about. And it’s not like I’m some shitty employee. I’m essentially a severely underpaid manager whose working their ass off to get promoted."
unpopularopinion,f5v14yz,t1_f5uzi3f,1572482193.0,"And I’m sure if we had the same “rockstar” attitude, same experience, and flexibility, you would be pissed that I was making $4 more than you. Are you saying that you wouldn’t like to know?"
unpopularopinion,f5v0qgr,t1_f5uzp3c,1572482036.0,"I’m showing her how to do a job that she knows nothing about, and that I know every single thing about in and out at the top of my head. I’m supposedly two steps above her, and she’s starting off making $2 more than me."
unpopularopinion,f5v04e7,t1_f5uwsow,1572481809.0,"THIS is the shit I’m talking about, they make it so secretive and then get upset when we find out the busboy is making bank for no reason. Yeah we’re going to get upset, because we have the right to."
unpopularopinion,f5uz82a,t1_f5tzcpu,1572481452.0,"She has had previous restaurant experience, but she’s not experienced in this company like I am. I am THE most flexible person on the team. I’m told all the time that they wouldn’t know what to do if I wasn’t there. If that’s the case why am I not being valued that way?"
unpopularopinion,f5uyvc9,t1_f5ulxhw,1572481311.0,"Because someone I was training was making more money than me, if they truly think that she has the experience and is that much more valuable than me, she can train herself."
unpopularopinion,f5tue1t,t1_f5sw13u,1572464444.0,"It’s food service, so absolutely not. The woman would crash and burn if she were put to it on her own. I’ve been here three years so it’s more understandable, but the people who’ve been here TEN years???? Shouldn’t be taboo to inquire."
Baking,ewtvp9q,t1_ewttpea,1565755157.0,"So my inspiration was the matcha green tea latte from Starbucks. It’s not super sweet, but it just cuts through the bitterness of the matcha and just leaves behind this incredible green tea flavor. I personally like my cookies thin and crispy so you have to tweak it if you’d like yours a bit thicker. 
Recipe 
1 1/2 cups of shortening 
1 egg
1/4 cup of oat milk 
3 cups of flour 
2 1/2 teaspoons of baking soda 
White chips 
1/4 teaspoon mint extract 
1 teaspoon of vanilla 
2 teaspoons Matcha powder + 1 cup powdered sugar for topping 
Cream shortening, sugar and egg. Incorporate oat milk, vanilla, and mint. Sift all dry ingredients into wet, add the white chips to your preference. Bake at 330 degrees for about 10 minutes, or until the top of the cookie is just barely cooked. (I like mine a bit underdone). Transfer cookies from tray, to a place to cook. When cool throw some of that powdered sugar on and then you’re done!! :P"

depression,evagy8d,t3_cd0hjp,1564347445.0,It’s the strangest feeling in the world. The worst part is trying to carry on conversations with literally anybody. Like I’m using every ounce of energy I have to even be doing what I’m doing in the first place. I just feel so brain dead all the time and it sucks. Like I can’t even have a real conversation with my own boyfriend because my brain just won’t work. Idk what to do.
Soda,ev61gh8,t3_cih36w,1564241365.0,This sucks
