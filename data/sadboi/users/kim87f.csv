Anche la palestra fa bene, l sercizio fisico è fondamentale per sollevare l'umore (la domanda è, ci vai in maniera metodica e costante?).

Per quanto riguarda il resto non so: credo che la nostra fascia di età 25-35 soffra del conflitto tra il voler fare di più, l'aspirarre a ""di più"" ma in una realtà che non permette di mettersi in gioco. Abbiamo troppa paura. Dei contratti di lavoro, della disoccupazione, della fila di altri giovani pronti a sostituirti appena rallenti, poi c'è una paura culturale tramandata, che vede solo muri e posto fisso.

BPD,f93cbf5,t1_f93beyl,1575055379.0,"That sucks! Alright, didn't realize it could get this bad. To be honest I don't browse regularly, that's clearly absurd to suggest something that petty.

What you say is true; also narcissistic disorder is fairly demonized, as well as some others. But I came to the conclusion that I can't pretend our disorder does not impact other people's feelings in a different, and possibly trickier, way than depression does or PTSD does.. It takes a toll on a partner, it's a lot of hard work and triggers and paranoia and mind games and talking, communication, drama, pain...at least it has been for me. With my now SO we went through all the steps of hell to be where we are now; three years in, still keeping things in check (he broke my three months-relationship curve)

EDIT: I Have to add, I was also undiagnosed most of my life so didn't really know what was going on. That probably had an impact too"
BPD,f93azmi,t1_f939p3r,1575054400.0,"It's true they are harsh, but I know in my youth I've been a real bitch to some of my then-bfs/FPs. I wasn't diagnosed but if I was, these kids would have probably gone talk about me there XD

OP seems fairly young and nice and willing to pursue this girl happiness...we don't know how she's feeling, there are some red flags, he might need some other stories to put things in prospective. Taking everything with a grain of salt"
BPD,f939eod,t1_f9379uz,1575053236.0,"A little this...but hey, if you are the exception, great! Just don't let this relationship drain you, do things as you would with anyone else, just keep everything  in check (especially for yourself). Relationships can be very hard when BPD is involved, you both have a lot of work to do. If things get rocky check r/BDPlovedones"
relationships,f8wbgmu,t1_f8w32c1,1574887111.0,This! Such good advice
relationships,f8c4sv4,t3_e055ha,1574452448.0,"Talk to your sister. With an open and honest heart. She is surely still grieving from the injury and how her life course has changed, she might be depressed BUT she is also acting like a spoiled brat. 

Her sufferings can be validated, yes, but she also needs to be told that her behaviour sucks and how the whole deal is unfair (literally money-wise) and unpleasant for everyone. 

Ask her if she wants to be baby-ed all her life or wants to do something with herself. And seek help for depression."
