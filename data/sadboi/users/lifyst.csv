I firmly believe that a common low-income or poor American has 5x as much finance and success chances as an Egyptian in the same state

also I'm very uninformed when it comes to big boy politics and all but being an Egyptian is different than being an American inside Egypt, I think impressing our tourists is a bit of an understatement, foreigners are almost sacrilegious to us, but that doesn't stop us from scamming them near tourist sites"

im gonna try to generalise, avoid any accidental ""re-shares.""

the power of a rehabilitations and psychiatrics and the likes, cannot begin to even engage in a comparison with the power of intent. 
one of my friends has been smoking a localized drug, hashish, for about 18 years, hes had many attempts at quitting and a lotta external help... nothing worked.
he recently had a drop at work.. finances hit the ground he had some problems with his fianc√©e, it was weighing down on him along with many other things... until he just quit.
he decides he's done throws it all behind his back. his other problems are yet to be resolved but he quit smoking with the snap of a finger.

no one couldve seen it coming, it didnt have to be all the work problems that made him quit, but you just never know where change might come from, or when it does. but im certain psychiatry doesnt really do much when put into perspective.

when i grew up, before my dad died, he used to tell me a lot of stories about how he was judo expert and how he was multilingual.. i wasnt present during any of that.. but before the effects of old age started showing up on him, i thought ""man my dads cool as hell!""
then, well.. that thought started to fade out as i found out more and more about my family's shitty history, and i started hating my dad and wishing him a quick death when he was at the point of frequent hospitalization. i was about 13 at the time.

as i grew older i understood more of why my dad would do anything he did, and i thought ""welp... hes not the best dude but hes also not the worst.""

any son goes through different phases growing up, infact any human does.. even way past infancy and childhood and adulthood. depression is probably a common phase, and it could lead to suicidal thoughts most of the time but it *is* a phase... its just important that whoever's in charge makes sure those minors who are in need of care get through that phase safely, and whenever possible, theyre obliged to do the right thing, exclusively so... and when the time comes eventually, theyll grow up and realize that their parents were great.

play chess with life, my man;

make your best move, make sure it's your best move.. when theres nothing else to do, end your turn and just be patient."

it bothers me for you to say that to the point i cant overlook it. the people youre talking about are the type of extreme linearity, that their thought process is probably way too shallow to even be capable of realising their purpose.
