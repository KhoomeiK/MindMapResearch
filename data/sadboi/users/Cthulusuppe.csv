LateStageCapitalism,fmss1mm,t1_fmsmduk,1586361095.0,"The problem is there's no material support for change.  Take the current crisis.  Flat, one-time issuance of a UBI of $1200 +$500/kid.  It's something, but that's about all I can say about it compared to:  Unemployment bailout to the tune of an additional $2400/month targeted at the middle-class-- ""essential"" workers didn't get this.  Business bailouts in the hundreds of billions.  QE of at least a few trillion (but essentially unlimited).  

I don't believe the middle-class will ever vote to materially support any revolutionary actions undertaken by low-wage workers.  There's no evidence hinting at the possibility.  They won't even limit the cash-grabs wealthy capitalists force on common tax-payers every time there's the slightest disruption to the status quo.

If your support is limited to cheerleading, there is no support, because the wealthy will destroy us before they offer a fair wage (let alone ownership of our labor)-- and the government will help them.  

If you wanna show gratitude or express commiseration toward ""essential"" workers, start voting for politicians and policies that give them a measure of flexibility.  Take the boot off their necks and they may get up and fight!  Heck, the shrinking middle-class might even rebuild a bit.  

If political discourse began arguing over the most effective ways to help our neighbors, rather than which neighbors' needs we can safely ignore, things would be a damn sight better.... but pointing at a bootstrap with the promise of applause should the poor manage to lift themselves with it... is about as helpful as the capitalists' unfulfilled promise of reward for hard work.

We see it in our standard of living and in our anxiety levels every-waking-moment.  What we lack is any clear path out of the system without risking the little we already have.  And since 90% of what we have goes to necessities (the remaining 10% goes to interest payments on debts for an occasional and pitiable luxury, and/or toward whatever pathetic retirement plan we have), most of us can't afford that risk.

Join (or organize) a union, get fired, and watch your family starve.  Or, continue on the path before you, looking for incremental opportunities to save for a retirement you'll likely never see.  This is the coercion inherent in wage-slavery.

M1's customer support is not a selling-point for the brokerage.

2) I got used to the idea that gradual improvement is worth my time.  I don't need to be perfect tomorrow, as long as I'm making progress.  If I have a set-back it's because I took too large a step forward, and the way to fix that is to take a smaller step."

It's definitely a negative.  Over the long term the lack of control will probably benefit you as often as it hurts you, but in the immediate-term you will occasionally buy a bounce when you meant to buy a dip.  You can minimize the sting of such occurrences by DCAing once-a-week with smaller investments rather than once-a-month or once-a-quarter, but short-term volatility doesn't mix well with a lack of control.  I won't speak for everyone, but I can avoid panic-selling without lacking the option.  I'd still like to put my money into the market at my preferred valuations."

The immediate threat is going to be the costs of testing for the disease and then any subsequent quarantines that'll lead to loss of income and jobs.  A lot of people will be avoiding hospitals, exposing the systemic flaws of private healthcare that lead to outbreaks.

All the healthcare-sector investors that're afraid of a Sander's presidency are about find out why the US needs to reform health insurance.  In the meantime, it's the common citizen that'll suffer most.  The wealthy, mostly insulated, will just notice slipping profit margins and a corresponding slide in the stock market.  Hopefully they're able to put two-and-two together and their greed brings them to the same conclusion compassion has had for decades.

My post was an attempt to advise some sober caution before OP blew up her workplace.  I'm not sure what you're ""on about"" but it doesn't seem to have much to do with OP or the man that may have harassed her.

I have spent far too much time on your poor reading comprehension and unjustified accusations of ""bullying"".

This includes victims.  Just because someone has the power, doesn't mean they should exercise it.

Let's take an absurd example: pretend stepping on a flower merited the death penalty.  If I witnessed a child absent-mindedly commit this crime, I would be well within my rights to report it.  However, I think that given the severity of the punishment-- even if I agree with the law in principle-- I am morally obligated to exhaust other avenues for redress before I act to involve the authorities.  IMO, this is true even if I am certain the child is aware of the law and appears to have purposefully smooshed the flowers.

Why kill the child when they can be redeemed?

Why get the manager fired if there are less destructive ways to end the undesired behavior?"
ptsd,fgdfkjj,t3_exthg0,1580681979.0,"There's almost never a reason to touch a co-worker.  That said, the only thing you've described that I'd consider a red-flag is his tickling your waist.  A light touch or shoulder-bump can be due to cramped working conditions, but a tickle is a tickle.

I would direct the work relationship by example at first.  Always say ""excuse me"" or ""I'm behind you"" and never touch him.  Reserve your knuckle-cracking for when you're not in his presence. And let him know that tickling isn't appropriate.  If he needs access somewhere near your personal space, make way for him.  Don't give him an excuse to touch you.  This is all about protecting yourself.

As far as getting justice:  If you feel the need to escalate (e.g. report to HR, or his boss), I would prioritize reporting the tickling, as that's clearly crossing a line.  The other things you've described can be explained away.  The face-proximity thing in particular seems like an unfortunate happenstance.  Remember that a person's job is often their livelihood and businesses aren't super keen to hire 60 year olds that've just been fired for gross misconduct.  You shouldn't have to endure harassment, but inappropriate behavior can often be corrected with forthright communication.  Only you can decide if communication has failed and escalation is necessary."

PTSD diagnoses aren't handed out like candy.  There are very specific criteria that're required.  And though it's useful to understand these criteria-- especially as they apply to you-- it might be absurd to expect everyone know what those criteria are before they're allowed to use the terms.

To someone with a panic disorder, a ""trigger"" is something that makes them believe death is imminent and it completely disrupts their life.  To the kid down the block, a ""trigger"" is something that annoys them to the point of hyperbole.  Is it dangerously callous to ridicule the former? (imo, yes) The latter? (not at all)

I think it's perfectly fine to mock someone using ""trigger"" to describe a petty annoyance.  I don't take it personally at all.  My triggers are clinical things, and I can separate them from the joke."
