Methadone,fr51z22,t1_fr4yaqr,1589901064.0,"Hey.  

I am 35. First injected heroin at 19. First went on methadone at 20 or 21. This was my 4th time on the program since then. I’ve also been on suboxone. 

Highest dose I’ve been on was 90mg. Been addicted to benzos and meth (ice is what we call it here) for most of my adult life as well. 
I first was prescribed anti depressants at 12 years old. I’ve been on several different types as well as various psych drugs / mood stabilisers.   

Been in rehab and the psych ward 2x. Overdosed and been to the ER via ambulance 10+ times (all accidental). 

I’ve seen countless health professionals, therapists, counsellors and specialists etc, to try and get help throughout my life.   

Diagnosed with poly substance abuse, ptsd, pmdd, BPD, bipolar 2, adhd, anxiety, depression, agoraphobia and a bunch of other stuff (I didn’t agree with any of the diagnoses other than depression, anxiety and poly substance abuse). 

My life has been pretty much a pattern of using heroin, back to methadone and then back to using.

Was on the program for 3.5 years this time around. I was on 75mg in Jan. I tapered down to 40mg. 

I’ll be completely honest, although I got mocked here before for saying it. I only got off it by the grace of God. It’s nothing I did myself. I surrendered to God, asked Jesus to help me and felt God tell me I could stop with His strength.  

I was prescribed 15mg Valium, 100mg Zoloft and 40mg methadone per day when I stopped. I was also smoking meth/ice daily at the time and quit that too.  

Didn’t think I could do it, hence why I saved up all that methadone. 
Last year I got down to 20mg, tried to jump off using Valium and catapress for withdrawals, went and used heroin 3 days later. I was literally tormented with thoughts of using and couldn’t handle it. 

This time (with Jesus in my life), I just stopped and had no thoughts of using and no withdrawals other than sneezing, lethargy and a little pain in my lower back (which was from spending too much time in bed).   
I never experienced any of the withdrawals that I was afraid of. No sweating or running to the bathroom, no severe pain or flu like symptoms.  

I waited for the worst to come and it never came. It was not hard compared to what I was expecting. I can’t explain it in any other way than by saying that I got so sick of being chained to the program and addicted to ice that I cried out to God in desperation, and He had mercy on me. 

I used ibuprofen, Valium and catapress for the first week or so and then stopped taking those as I didn’t need them. I let my body rest and focussed on prayer and eating healthily.   

A month before I stopped, I also was finally able to leave my boyfriend who is addicted to ice, heroin and was also on methadone.  
We were toxic together and were only destroying one another. I don’t think I could have done it if I stayed with him as he wasn’t a great influence on me. 2 broken people can’t fix one another.  
I still care about him and pray that he’ll be able to clean up his life.   

Sorry if it’s not the best answer. But it’s the only answer I have. I also no longer feel depressed or anxious or feel like I have any sort of mental health issues. I feel free and at peace."

The prices are reasonable too.  

I bought some cheaper pet clothes and they are garbage compared to the ones I bought from meadow Sphynx. I ended up throwing them away and will only get my Sphynx clothes from this site from now on.

I did not get high, I got SO SICK. I was shaking and freezing uncontrollably like my body was so cold, even wrapped in blankets wearing heaps of clothes on a warm day, nothing could warm me up.   

Thought I was dying, so scary had to call a doctor to my home. Couldn’t even talk properly or dial the number properly because my body was shaking so badly.   

Idk if it was the methadone that did it or if there was some type of bacteria in it that made my body go into shock (it should have been sterile)  but it was bad enough to scare the heck out of me. 

Never experienced that with shooting meth or smack or anything else.

You are speaking heresy.

Christianity,fr3zfhk,t3_glz95j,1589870767.0,"Amen, Jesus is THE LIGHT, the eternal Word of God.   

John 1:1-14
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.   
He was in the beginning with God. 
All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made.   
In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.   
And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.

There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.   
This man came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe.  
He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.  
That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world. 

He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him.  
He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.   
But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.   

And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."
Christianity,fr3lv0e,t1_fr3g2lo,1589860284.0,"Maybe you can watch the first 20 minutes or so. 

My God took on human form and died as an innocent man in order to clear your name, my name and the name of whoever believes in Him.   

All of us have sinned and fall short of God’s standard. Yet He made a way out for anyone who calls upon Him.  

It’s not His will that any should perish.   
He loves you. I assume that you are LGBTQ and therefore you feel that my God hates you. That is not true.  

I assume that you believe that my God would reject you because of your sexuality. That’s not true. The Bible says we are saved by grace through faith and not because of anything we did or didn’t do ourselves. 

He accepted me when I was addicted to injecting drugs, having drug fuelled orgies, sleeping around with other women, prostituting myself to rich married men, lying, stealing, full of anger, pride, resentment, and emotional turmoil.   

His love changed my life. His love healed my broken heart. His love set me free.   

If you choose not to believe that God loves you and that He would reject you, based on your sexuality, or based on what other ‘Christians’ have told you, you have got the wrong God.   

MY God, so loved the world that He sent His only begotten Son, so that WHOSOEVER should believe in Him, would not perish but have everlasting life.

Christianity,fr3kgzr,t1_fr3gbiu,1589859377.0,"I feel that you didn’t watch the video. It explains much of what you stated to be evidence for evolution.   
Dawkins I did listen to. He stated that it’s possible we came from a higher form of intelligence. 
Do you reject that idea?   
I’ve watched tons of debates and question times with well educated people who defend evolution.    
They fail to answer so many questions for me. 

Dawkins himself can not answer all of the questions about his theory. He is indeed very intelligent. But still just a man, with a theory. Full of holes.   


Nothing came before my God. He isn’t bound by space or time. He always has been and always will be.  

Understanding God, as a human, is like a newborn baby trying to understand an adult and the way they do things. It’s not possible. Their minds can not comprehend such things yet. 
Any God who I could fully understand, wouldn’t be a god. If God exists, He created this universe, His power and wisdom is beyond human comprehension. Anything less than that isn’t worthy of my worship. 

Either you believe in a purely materialistic world, or you believe the spiritual realm to exist.   
If you choose the first, (which to me, does not make sense), then it’s totally your choice.   

If you believe in the spiritual realm, then that opens the possibility of higher intelligence than humans, and there must be a source of higher intelligence. 

Now if you want to examine what the true source is (as there are many gods in other religions, I agree), you have the ability to do this. If you have reddit, you have internet access to study all religions and gods and theological beliefs.   

You can take each one and use the process of elimination to examine and reject what you decide is false.  

Science confirms my faith. Science is mans way of studying and trying to work out what God has given us, with the mind that God has given us and the amount of discoveries that support the Bible, the amount of wisdom in the Bible that was revealed to humans in ancient times, before modern day humans even discovered such things, confirms to me that God is real.   

My personal relationship with God and Him opening my eyes to the spiritual realm, His presence in my life, confirms to me that even more is real.  
Unfortunately I can’t take you on my journey. Your journey is your own.  

It seems you’ve chosen your path and if you are truly satisfied in what you believe, if you feel it to be fact, if it brings you peace and gives you a good understanding about who you are, why you’re here and what’s going to happen when you die, that’s great and I’m happy for you. I’m not going to keep fighting with you and I know that I can’t convert you or anyone else.

For evolution as you believe it, to be real, genetic information and DNA has to produce extra information.   
Matter has to be able to produce something like DNA.  

DNA has an author. It can not write itself. 

It can’t and doesn’t. Dawkins admits this, he won’t admit there is a God, he refers to it as a higher intelligence from another universe before ours. And what came before that? And before that? And before that?

Stay away from “faith healers” anyone saying they’ve been to Heaven or Hell, Sid Roth channel on YouTube and anyone saying talking about some special “anointing” all the time.   

They are fake. Stay away from anyone who does things like “slaying in the spirit” or “drunk in the spirit” it’s a kundalini spirit. Not the Holy Spirit.

There will be a great delusion coming as predicted in Revelation, the great harlot mystery Babylon (false church/religion) who commits fornication with the world will deceive if possible, even the very elect.  

We need to line everything up with scripture. And pray for the lost sheep, that they will come out of her and not be deceived by the ravenous wolves in sheep’s clothing.

Bible,fqzuqkm,t3_gkjnls,1589775866.0,"Proverbs 9:10. 
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,
And the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.   

Proverbs 15:33. 
The fear of the Lord is the instruction for wisdom,
And before honor comes humility.   

Proverbs 1:7. 
The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge;
Fools despise wisdom and instruction.  

Gods wisdom and mans wisdom are 2 different things. No carnal man can understand the ways of God. They are spiritually blind unless they seek diligently after the truth and God removes the veil.   
We need to humble ourselves and seek Him in Spirit and in truth.  

Most humans don’t want to humble themselves. They are blind with their own pride, they will never receive spiritual wisdom, and actually will not be able to comprehend it, even despising it, unless they become humble before God, seeking it at whatever the cost, even if it means spitting out all of their own pride.   

If we seek the Lord with reverence, knowing His ways are higher than our ways and His thoughts higher than our thoughts. 
He will grant us spiritual wisdom and understanding. The type that the world cannot receive or understand.  
The Holy Spirit dwells within the born again believer and leads and guides us into truth.  

1 Corinthians 1:18-19
The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God.   
As the Scriptures say,   
“I will destroy the wisdom of the wise
and discard the intelligence of the intelligent.”   

1 Corinthians 21-25. 
Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe.   
It is foolish to the Jews, who ask for signs from heaven. And it is foolish to the Greeks, who seek human wisdom. 
So when we preach that Christ was crucified, the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it’s all nonsense.

But to those called by God to salvation, both Jews and Gentiles, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.   
The foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God’s weakness is stronger than the greatest of human strength."

We can only become born again by God’s grace, through faith in and accepting Jesus. It’s a real and spiritual experience.

God’s plan of redemption and love and mercy towards those who put their faith in Him, will then become clear and you will see that the entire Bible points to Jesus as the Messiah.  
Christianity is all about Jesus and His life is the life we are to use as our perfect example.   

The other prophets and people of faith in the Bible are a good example for us and we can learn much from them. All were human and all sinned in some way.

The entire OT highlights the sinful nature of humanity and inability to fulfil the law.   
The OT people of faith, received Salvation through faith and the work of Jesus on the cross. 

He died for past present and future sins of those who have faith.   

Each book in the OT points to Jesus, even from Genesis. He is our Sabbath. He is our rest. He is the seed of Eve who crushed the serpents head when He conquered sin & death for those who have faith.    

We have 2 commandments, to love the Lord with all our heart, mind and soul and to love our neighbour as Jesus loves us.  
In doing this, the law is fulfilled.   

God requires mercy from His people, not sacrifice. That’s all He ever required. The mosaic law is for the unbeliever and that’s what they’ll be judged by.

If we love with God’s standard, we won’t hurt ourselves and others.   

The 10 commandments are based on love. If we love as Jesus did, we won’t commit any of those things. Breaking the law hurts ourselves and others. 

Jesus is the fulfilment of the law. If everyone followed His teachings there would be none of these problems in the world. 

Just as we expect justice if someone did something to harm us, how much more so should God require justice for breaking His laws? All of us have sinned and fall short of God’s standard but yet He made a way for anyone who wants to be saved, to be reconciled with Him."

So you believe in God but not the story of Genesis? Because Genesis is in opposition to evolution as you understand it.   

“Untold” numbers of animals. Untold, meaning it’s an assumption? Define “untold”? What came before the untold? Space, time, matter and light are required for this universe to operate. Where did they come from?    

You don’t think the story of Genesis makes any sense? Even the order in which things were created? (Heavens and Earth created first, light created before plants and other life forms)?    

It’s logical that light and water had to come before plants and other life forms otherwise they couldn’t exist.  

Time and space had to exist for anything else to exist. How can time and space evolve? 

The Bible says “From dust you are, to dust you shall return”. 
The human body does decompose into the dust which is made up of elements. It’s also logical to believe therefore (to me), that the first human was formed in the same way from that same dust.   

Am I missing something about evolution? I just can’t seem to find any proof of anything. I can find science. And I can find the interpretation of science by scientists who believe in evolution but there are too many holes for me,  it cannot be proven.

Looking at someone like Dawkins, he seems pretty miserable for all his knowledge. He’s a super smart guy. But he’s still a human like the rest of us and all humans are flawed.

Christianity,fqtt45k,t1_fqt3ifg,1589645585.0,"Hey that’s pretty cool what you mentioned about the experience I had being a production of my brain.  
I was going to ask how my brain could work if my heart had stopped, but then I wondered if it was possible.   

I just googled if your brain can work after your heart stops and apparently it does.   
My heart is what stopped beating.    
My parents were told prior to that happening, if I did recover, I would be pretty much brain dead/damaged, because of them finding me with my lips blue and not responding to so much narcan. 

The fact that your brain works when your heart stops, actually confirms even further to me that my experience was real. Because if my brain wasn’t able to work, how would I know what was happening and remember it?    

I remember being faced with a choice, as my soul was floating above my body. And that choice was to cry out to Jesus, which I somehow managed to do with a whisper, that’s when my soul came back into my body. I fell asleep after that.   

Maybe God gives people a choice even after the heart stops. Even a few moments after death. I was not a Christian prior to that, actually I didn’t even become a Christian until a little while after that. I began to do research and pray and seek God but I didn’t make up my mind immediately.   
I was stubborn, but I also couldn’t deny life felt kind of pointless, so I made up my mind to try to find the answers to my questions, and the remedy for my problems. In the end, I decided I had nothing to lose. I’d tried everything else to no avail.  

Nowhere else other than Christianity could I find all the answers to my questions, or find a peace and purpose that made sense to me.   
Islam (as an example), made no sense to me.   
Living as Jesus did, is something that did make sense to me.    
Especially after my experience. The more I prayed and did research, the more I found answers.
I may not understand everything still, but I have 100x more understanding of things than I did before. Things make much more sense to me now.    

If God is real, He’s infinite and much higher than us, since He created us. We can’t even change the colour of our hair naturally.   
So I don’t expect to understand Him completely. I don’t expect anyone ever will. He’s God.  

A God who we could understand perfectly would not be worth worshipping to me. I have to have the belief that He is much higher than me if I am to believe that He created the universe.


If people can find all the answers to life’s questions, and peace and purpose elsewhere, that’s great for them. I couldn’t find it elsewhere. 


I can only say that knowing Jesus has turned my life around 180 degrees. It’s like all the junk i was carrying around had just been lifted from my shoulders.   
I’m not perfect. I now have a reason to try to be and a standard to strive for. 

I’ll always fall short of the standard of God, but His grace and mercy are sufficient for me, and He promises to continue changing me for the better, until He calls me home.   

I would not trade my faith now for anything in the world.   
I like this Bible verse: “For what does it profit a man, to gain the whole world, but lose his soul?”   

I tried the world, everything it had to offer. I did not withhold any carnal pleasure from myself that was available to me. I have tried to find peace & purpose in sex with both men and women, relationships, drugs, parties, success, power etc to no avail.    

Being fit and physically attractive never helped me find peace or purpose, neither did doctors or therapy, self help or meditation etc etc.   

I tried everything the world had to offer and the more I tried, the more I got, the more I realised how pointless things seemed. It just didn’t work for me.

Jesus gave a standard by which His followers were to behave in that society back then.

There were no airplanes back then, the world was not as it is today. It was not physically possible for a world leader to rise and cause the entire world to receive a mark in/on their hand or forehead.   

How can people from all walks of life, all educational backgrounds and whom have never met one another, produce a book with harmony and prophetic accuracy, which gives an answer to every question a human has in life, and is relevant thousands of years later?    

Can you provide me with another book like this? And don’t say the Quran because I have studied Islam and I can give you 101 reasons why ‘Allah the best deceiver’ & false prophet Mohammad aren’t it.

How do you explain these things that cannot be explained in human terms?  
There are only 2 logical conclusions.   
Either the spiritual realm is real (regardless of what God is the true God),   
Or billions of people are imagining things.   
The 2nd answer leaves many more unanswered questions than the first.   

What is your theory regarding where we came from? Where did all the Earth and universe come from? How did it come into being? What is your most logical explanation, from your own research? 

Maybe if you can come to the conclusion that the spiritual realm does exist, you can then go on to search for the meaning behind it.   
When I say spiritual, I am talking about forces which are beyond human."
Christianity,fqs3ugl,t1_fqr9xf8,1589597907.0,"I didn’t just kick drugs. I stopped 40mg of methadone suddenly, with none of the typical withdrawal symptoms.   
I of myself, could not do that.   

I don’t believe in coincidences.    
I’m surprised you chose Islamic accounts as evidence.   
I cried out to God if He existed, to show me as I was ready to kill myself, I was met with a Christian literally 3 minutes later, who was talking to my drug dealer. You can take it as a coincidence but I take it as answer to my prayer and the following events confirmed that.    
How many coincidences have to take place, until it’s no longer a coincidence?   

There is only one true God. Which means all others are false and of the Devil.    

Now if I believe that Allah may be the one who was behind this, he should have sent me a Muslim. To decide if I will believe in the Islamic Allah as the true god, I need to look at the nature of Islam, their god, their (false) prophet and the Quran.   

Mohammad married a 6 year old when he was 50.   
Mohammad slept with dead women, ordained rape and murder.  
Mohammad said that Muslim men can have 4 wives, yet he himself took many more.   
Mohammad encourages jihad.    
Islamic terrorists wear lead around their private parts when using bombs to blow themselves and their surroundings up, because they think they are going to use their penises in this fake paradise with virgins who Allah gives them.   
If there is a paradise, all would be complete there, it would be a spiritual realm with no need for physical body parts such as a penis.     

The Quran has no documents to authenticate it, all other supposed evidence to support it was conveniently ‘burned’.       
Islam is a violent religion.     
Mohammad was a fat, perverted, lying, violent, sick individual.    
Allah is called ‘the best deceiver’ in the Quran. That makes ‘Allah’ a liar.    
Satan is called the great deceiver and father of lies in the Bible.    
The true God, is absolute in goodness and holiness, and not from a human perspective.    
He is embodied in the person of Christ, who lived a life which was totally opposite to that of Mohammad.     

Compare the lives and teachings of the 2 men. If there is only one God, and the other is from the Devil, for arguments sake, which do you believe is more likely to be of God, and which of Satan?  
The Bible says there are other spirits, to test the spirits. Islam is wicked and to see that all you have to do is compare their prophet to Jesus.  
You cannot claim both to be of the same source and there are not 2 sources of absolute truth.   

Regardless of whether you have faith or not, here you can use your logic and reasoning."

The papers won’t prove super natural causes. They will say I overdosed and was given multiple shots of narcan with no response and that I flatlined and came back.  

The hospital can’t tell you what I experienced in that time in the spiritual.

The pharmacy log book won’t be able to show that I had none of the typical withdrawal symptoms, because I just stopped going so it will only show my script, the dose and what dose I stopped on (40mg) and when.  

Nobody can feel my withdrawal symptoms to record them except for me.    
My family witnessed it, how it was a miracle.   
They know that I had that struggle for so many years and tried so many times to get off it. I tried with both tapering and cold turkey and couldn’t get off it.

The deliverance resulted in me being able to accept Jesus and my life/heart transforming radically from awful to much better. I couldn’t before change before that.

I told him he could keep it and I wouldn’t be back but he said he would leave it in there if I ever decided to come and get it.

Christianity,fqpn90j,t1_fqpkrsx,1589550225.0,"I know actually. I died in hospital from a drug overdose. I flatlined and my soul left my body. I experienced the spiritual realm and deliverance from demonic possession. Didn’t understand what it was until I googled it and found other people had the same experience.   

Nothing could save me. Not doctors or medicine or therapists or rehab or lovers or money or drugs or popularity or physical beauty or success or anything else.   

It was only when I called upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that I was saved.   
And it’s very much like being blind spiritually, and then being able to see.   

So whilst I understand you are offended, I also know it’s because you’re spiritually blind, as I was once. And I would’ve argued the same as you are.  

And boy, would I get offended if someone bought up Jesus or God. But if people really truly believe it, why aren’t they warning everyone? Because they’re scared they’ll offend someone? If someone is truly convicted in their beliefs, this is an eternal life or death situation.   

I stand firmly convicted in what I know to be true.   
If you have died and experienced the spiritual realm, feel free to share your experience.   

I’m not going to continue to argue with you, it won’t end. You can’t understand right now but I can say all that I speak with 100% conviction. And I say it with love, even if you don’t understand it now, hopefully one day you will. I really truly hope that for you.

Ask God to show you, with a sincere heart. Keep asking and He will show you, if you are genuinely seeking.

We are spiritually blind until God opens our eyes. That’s why I can’t show you anything to make you believe. You can research the Bible and geographical evidence ie Sodom & Gomorrah on YT. But honestly it’s kind of like being blind until God opens your eyes to the spiritual realm.

I know you won’t believe if it hits you in the face because I was like you.   

I was raised in Church and rejected all of it. I never knew God. I knew the stories and that’s it.  

I have experienced God personally, and have had demons cast out of me. I have died in hospital and my soul left my body. Jesus bought me back, that was before I was a Christian.

I have been addicted to heroin and meth, spent about 20yrs on methadone and stopped cold turkey from 40mg plus 15mg Valium per day plus 100mg Zoloft per day with no withdrawals or depression, because God had mercy on me.   

Ppl in the methadone sub told me that I’d be calling my ‘Mexican Jesus H dealer’ in a few days, they know it’s literally impossible to do that with no withdrawals. I have tried to stop cold turkey last year without God. I lasted 3 days and shot up heroin.

But this time it was too easy, with God, all things are possible.

I can’t show you the wind, but it’s there. You haven’t seen it but you know it’s there.

Veneration is similar to worship or respect: we feel veneration for things and people we adore and are devoted to completely.

This is a strong word. The main meaning is for a type of religious zeal: if you unquestionably believe in your religion, then you feel and show veneration for your god and beliefs. Also, veneration can apply outside religion when you have enormous respect for something or someone. Great people like Martin Luther King or Mother Theresa inspire veneration. If you feel a combination of awe and love for someone, you are full of veneration.
