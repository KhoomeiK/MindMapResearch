mentalhealth,fqyz5lr,t1_fqx9oed,1589757065.0,This is literally me as well! I feel like I'm making it up
mentalhealth,fqnwra5,t3_gjlgur,1589502929.0,"I feel this. Ever since I've moved I've had a feeling where I miss something but I've never been sure what, I've never felt at home in the new house but was so excited to get out of the old one. I also hope this stops one day"
Advice,fpezte6,t3_gd2zcq,1588558531.0,Just ask as a favour offer to do a few things for her. Shes your mum and should always be there for you.
Advice,fpezpzv,t3_gd304w,1588558471.0,Start sleeping somewhere else until they get the point and realise it's an issue. It may be uncomfortable for you but make it as easy as possible. Maybe use blankets and cushions on the floor or sleep on the sofa. Hope this works!!
JustNoFriend,fosio8s,t1_footoh0,1588031464.0,"Thank you for your advice and understanding. Makes me feel so much better when I saw this, thank u!"

JustNoFriend,fosijl6,t1_fooyf63,1588031392.0,I really want to but I'm scared it will make it worse. I'm so tempted to though!
JustNoFriend,fosigrp,t1_fop9gl0,1588031347.0,Thank you for your help!
JustNoFriend,fool6ed,t1_fook8ox,1587941173.0,Thank you for agreeing and I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks its a bit of a shitty one. I'll take this on board thank you!
JustNoFriend,foofylk,t1_fooamoh,1587938261.0,I've tried to confront her and I have been pretty much arguing with her all day trying to make her understand the problem but she just doesnt agree with me that anything is wrong. Like she will not let me have an opinion or problem with her
JUSTNOMIL,fmy2pry,t3_fxzkun,1586476855.0, Considering your not meant to be seeing anyone at all at the moment you've done absolutely nothing wrong at all... I understand what his mum is saying although I guess its not her place to be rude or text you but your boyfriend was completely out of order
ThriftStoreHauls,fkxm3tl,t3_fl1fuz,1584630988.0,I loveeeeee this

AnnoyingPeople,fk97hm3,t1_fk8iv0i,1583970306.0,I've kind of mentioned that he's really picky but not openly told him like I have on this post
AnnoyingPeople,fk8gj01,t3_est0rv,1583955612.0,"My friend is like this is certain ways,she's also extremely self centred and bossy. She has to have her way or she will say something. She can be so rude about people and judge everyone by the stupidest things."
