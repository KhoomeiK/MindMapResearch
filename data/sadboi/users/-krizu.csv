AskReddit,fqblnmm,t3_ghlm5u,1589239312.0,"Finland here.

We were on the side of the nazis, we lost. 

They're pretty vague about our involvement in the holocaust and the ""finnish concentration camps (basically camps for russian POV's most sources say that 200-500 POV's died due to bad treatement, not sure about the numbers though) 

We also handed about 2000-5000 jews, russians and others to germans. This is taught pretty well but some modern books say that it was done under pressure from germany, while others say that there was no pressure. All respectable books do however mention that we did have pretty good understanding on what would eventually happen to them when they arrived to their destination.

It's that simple, nowadays it's more accepted as a historical fact that we were on the losing side, though ofc after the war there were huge ammounts of deniers.

Also what is disputed in modern books, are the circumstances in which finland chose to enter to the war on the axis side, most say that it was a conscious choice by the higher ups, while some also point out that other alternatives were not really possible in that climate.

What *every* book does mention however, though it is not played up to the extent as it used to be, is that Finland and germany didn't sign any pacts or papers stating that we were allies, nor did we share large ammounts of information with them.

What the books *do not* mention, is that 1. The fact about the papers does not matter, as we were fighting against the same enemy, while recieving aid from germany and allowing german units to fight in finland. And 2. To my knowledge, *none* of the axis powers signed such treaties. Some claim that germany didn't want to share their plans with their allies, fearing that they would not help them in russia or that they would slow germans down.

Most books circle around the whole subjects by stating that it's complicated or that historians do not agree. *like that makes any difference*"

I'm not sure if  it was deliberate,  due to the fact that when a pilot needs to shoot at something on the ground, the plane needs to be going roughly towards it, meaning that the plane needs to be aimed towards the ground, and I am not sold on the idea that any pilot would do that after completing their mission of dropping bombs just to murder a couple of civvies. Especially as I unserstood the girl's story that the planes who used machine guns were different planes than those who dropped the bombs.

Ofc there is another option, in the event that the fighters were not just covering the bombers, but on the attack as well. The option is that the idea for the run was to drop the bombs and then spray the area with bullets to clear out survivors, in which case civvies where most likely the target, why they would do that I do not know, but I doubt that it was nazi cruelty since while they were evil sons of bitches, they were not stupid (except göering) and further more, they were keenly aware of the lack of reliable fuel sources for germany."

I killed everything and everyone who, in even a small way pissed me off, while using only revolvers and rifles :p"
SubredditDrama,fp5cy8a,t1_fp583kb,1588324707.0,"I did too up until 2012s, playing a male character just came naturally

Around 2012 however, I was playing fallout new vegas for the umpteenth time and for the first time as a female character, and when I figured out that female characters have their own unique dialogue in places it *BLEW. MY. MIND*

Nowadays, I still don't care but I have noted how I seem to like female characters much more (I.e Veronica in Fallout new vegas, or Zoey in left 4 dead)

Personally I think it's at least partly due to the fact that actually good, well-written female characters are not as common as they should be, thus I am ""balancing things out"" so to speak"

What the hell, so this guy's saying that male gamer = prefers male statue, and then goes to say that ""oh it's not me having anything against females, I'm just concerned for their sales"" yea...*right*

I am a male gamer and I actually perfer the female statue, just like I perfer most female characters in video games  so I guess I am a living contradiction to this guys...""opinion"""
