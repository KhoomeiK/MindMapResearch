Also when it comes to love it would be unfair to her if she wanted a stable and loving family when she was older, I believe I'm loving, but I'm just not stable, letting a girl fall in love with me would seem unfair to her, robbing her of a possible better future without ever knowing me.

Even if I wasn't depressed, I know I'm not fit for the modern world, I can't study through college, get a career, have a family, then die, it just isn't me, I'd love a wife and child, but the cost of that seems to be sacrificing myself.

I feel you, the only positive memory I have from school is this one random girl who stood up for me when my brother and his friends was calling me a weirdo for ripping of the sides of my bologna sandwich so it would be fully square.

That was in like 3rd grade though lol.

My worst memory was being publicly rejected by a crush infront of the entire class, I can still hear their laughter, I don't resent her though, I was too socially anxious to actually talk with her so eventually she had enough of me staring at her like a total creep, it was kinda harsh but deserved tbh."
