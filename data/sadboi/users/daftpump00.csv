bipolar,fb980mq,t3_ebeoqf,1576631737.0,Anyone's experience with Vraylar and or Trileptal? I'm on 10mg of Abilify right now and not convinced it's for me.
bipolar,f6jhk48,t3_driqkm,1572894823.0,"What is your experience with Abilify titration? My dr started me at 2mg and now I'm at 4mg. Its been 2 weeks and I dont feel shit. At what dose did you start noticing its effects? And how long did your Dr take to get you there. I feel this is too slow.

Also, what is your experience in pairing Abilify with an antidepressant? Which antidepressant did you find paired best?"

bipolar,f1l2dvg,t3_d9p965,1569544844.0,"\^ story of my life. just got off lexapro/lamictal and now on symbyax (prozac/zyprexa) and lamictal. I also have taken adderrall off and on for the last 10 yrs to manage ADD, but have lowered dosage to avoid another manic episode

 so many questions, for y'all but I'll start with... What you are on now and what has worked for you to manage this beast within? I'm finally taking this into my own hands and am looking into everything I can find in all areas. Has anyone given ketamine a try to manage your depression? How about ECT? Other ideas? What's worked and what hasnt (besides antidepressants obv). My first goal is to just find the right combo that keeps me on a level playing field. Also headed to my first Bipolar group meeting tonight"
