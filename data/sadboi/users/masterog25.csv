Meditation,fqjndos,t1_fqebbye,1589412429.0,"It's not wrong no. Sooner or later the thinking of breathing becomes just another thought passing through your mind. Imagine you're a mountain and thoughts are like clouds just floating right by you. That's basically vipassana meditation. It can be hard at first not to try too hard, essentially doing the opposite of what you're trying to do, however with practice it will get easier. Good luck hare Krishna

have you tried taking long hits? like 5 second hits breathing into your belly?

can you see a thick stream of vapor coming out of the mouthpiece inbetween hits during a session?

is the airflow good? like if you inhale through the CU while its off the crafty, is it totally clear?
same with the actual vape, can u try puffing on it with the CU off? (and the crafty off of course haha).

tons of questions i know lol sorry"

AmsterdamEnts,fmcwot1,t1_fmbibl5,1585954349.0,Low temp vape is more like low thc weed I think. But it's still not the same thing cause the cannabinoid ratio is still not what it originally was. Imo all landrace plants should be the standard. Want something stronger? Make edibles or extracts.
