CoronavirusUS,fqoxcdy,t1_fqoiv8k,1589527750.0,"The fight to put labels on cigarettes was huge. The cig companies fought it tooth and nail. Additionally, people really did believe all of the advertising hype that cigarettes were safe because your doctor recommended them. It took years to finally bring the tobacco companies in front of Congress and stick needles in them. And even when they did show up they brought in their ‚Äúwitnesses‚Äù to say smoking cigarettes doesn‚Äôt increase your cancer risk. Even now cig sales are still allowed, but we‚Äôve effectively banned them from most locations and most people believe that cigarettes are harmful. We finally have public health studies funded that show the dangers of firsthand and secondhand smoke. Film depictions of smoking in movies are minimized. This is a HUGE change from how things used to be...until e-cig vaping came along, anyway. 

Sure, progressives wanted to totally ban cigarettes but it was a complicated process. Compromises always need to be made in politics to move anywhere. Also in case you haven‚Äôt noticed, people in this country don‚Äôt like being told not to buy things that kill people; it would be REALLY really hard to put a total ban on something that was once accepted. Prohibition eventually blew up in our faces. NYC tried to ban soda big gulps I don‚Äôt think that was successful...styrofoam, not really...plastic bags have come back during COVID, which is kinda understandable. 

If you‚Äôre curious about the fight against the tobacco companies, check out the book ‚ÄúSmoking and Politics‚Äù."

No, NYC is NOT the whole country. But it is the most populous city in the U.S. and it‚Äôs economically key, so that means lots of people travel there and back.

Art is art. Art is part of a conversation. Doesn‚Äôt really matter what the material is. Good art usually provokes strenuous disagreement. Does it matter what material an artist uses so long as no person or animal was injured or abused? What if they wore full protective gear while doing this, would that change your opinion?

The President‚Äôs face isn‚Äôt the American flag; we‚Äôre allowed to criticize him through visual imagery.

TBH I think a statue of Trump made out of horse shit is 100% American and right in line with Dadaism/works by Marcel Duchamp. One of his most famous works was simply a toilet. People told him he was pathetic too but he turned out to be a really influential artist. His art critiques materialism and branding.

There should not be a personal priority of having sex unless gf wants to initiate that with bf. BF should also not sit around never mentioning it for ages, meanwhile thinking about having the sex and giving her help in anticipation of having the sex, while also hoping GF will mention it one day. BF should admit to himself that sex is his primary ‚Äòneed‚Äô/interest right now and potentially look for another relationship or satiate himself in other ways; to do so otherwise is to initiate an abusive dynamic in the relationship (since he would be lying about who he really is).

the friend codes, the inability to send messages to whomever you want to unless you‚Äôve visited them, the inability to write your own profile without earning words, the separate voice chat on your phone and only if you‚Äôre playing the same game; these are all attempts to create a system that enables online play but shields its players from the worst of the abuse that other platforms experience. [edit] I‚Äôm GLAD that Nintendo is NOT letting 12 year olds in a 40 year old‚Äôs body from overrunning the service. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre keeping their online services focused on the player experience for ALL of their players, instead of just flapping lip service. I‚Äôm glad they care about information security by making it more difficult for random people to harass you. 

so yeah, it‚Äôs  not going to be perfect. there are going to be gaps because Nintendo has a finite set of engineers working on Switch issues for Animal Crossing specifically, and proper cloud saves to the switch service are probably in their change log. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôve considered it but there‚Äôs an intentional reason it‚Äôs not in there yet. Maybe there‚Äôs a big bug that‚Äôs not user-facing. Maybe there are other issues they‚Äôre solving that they‚Äôve deemed are higher priority. We don‚Äôt know why but it‚Äôs a heck of a lot to assume bad faith of a company that‚Äôs done so much to buck the traditional videogame experience.

As for why the Joy-Con are still messed up, well...it‚Äôs not easy to make a small controller and ship it out ASAP like that. The Joy-Con has a lot of tech in it and it‚Äôs all in a VERY small space. So many design concerns that they have to address: _is it comfortable to hold for most of our users? what about the remaining percentiles of users for whom this is not comfortable; what is their experience? Is the controller practical to manufacture? Are these buttons comfortable to press? Do the buttons rebound quickly enough? Will the rubber dome switch last enough years before folks will need a replacement and if so, how long do we expect these to last? Does the controller make a satisfying click that people will associate with ‚ÄòSWITCH‚Äô when it goes into the dock? Will it cut people‚Äôs hands? Will they be able to remove it easily? Will it charge? How long will the charge last before it needs to be switched out? Will the material we used to construct the Joy-Con give anyone contact dermatitis? Is the material still conductive enough to let the Joy-Con connect with the Switch at a distance?_

Sure, your dinky NES and PS3 controllers from 1994 still work (albeit the rubber domes probably need changing out), but did they have wireless contact charging, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and IR communication all packed into something a quarter of the size? No, no I don‚Äôt think they did.

To me the clearest sign that Nintendo cares about its players ‚Äî other than taking commercial risks to create entertaining and unusual products ‚Äî is that they haven‚Äôt added bullshit like achievements or constant advertising to the Switch home page (just the opening). They are literally NOT trying to take your money all of the time, unlike Xbox or Sony...the constant barrage of ads on my Xbox and Playstation is goddamn insulting. Ads literally fracture my attention and waste my time.

They finally added classic games for basically free like everyone wanted instead of making you pay 4.99 or 7.99 or however much they go for on the 3DS these days. So far they haven‚Äôt given us free games that we might barely like as part of a subscription either. I‚Äôve even see Nintendo games go on sale lately, like Super Mario Maker was 50% :o

Other improvements I‚Äôve seen: you can now add way more titles to your wishlist; you can HAVE a wishlist (which I don‚Äôt think is accessible on the PS4); the noises in the menu are goddamn cute and I look forward to them all the time lol. They have easily accessible descriptions of their games, but not reviews yet.

Is Nintendo a capitalist company? Yes. But do I feel like they care about me way more than Sony does? Yes. When I play my PS4 I think, ‚ÄúSony figures as long as they pump out exclusives, they can treat you however they want to when you get to their platform.‚Äù

The times I made exceptions I kinda regret, except for Resident Evil 2 ‚Äî I was literally waiting for that forever, the waiting is part of what made playing it so much fun later. I‚Äôm so glad I got the collector statue, Leon with a shotgun is my BAMF. :) Also, I bought Animal Crossing digitally when the pandemic hit, which so far I don‚Äôt regret either. It‚Äôs not a perfect system. 
* Stopped gaming on either Steam or PlayStation (for now). The mere presence of achievements makes it more difficult for me to enjoy the game and settle into it as an experience. I‚Äôd get so anxious about making ‚Äúprogress‚Äù that I forgot to enjoy the journey, which was the whole magic of playing games in the first place. Then I‚Äôd start collecting games that I never play because I wanted to ‚Äúprove‚Äù my chops...against who?? None of my friends care. I‚Äôm so glad Nintendo has resisted until now. 
* Cut myself off from any repetitive strategy type games with no conclusion. For now I‚Äôve decided that Civ is just too much of an addiction for me.
* Promised myself to buy physical as often as possible. Came to the realization that buying tons of games you‚Äôll never play, at full price, is like making a diminishing investment in a digital license. It‚Äôs worth pretty much nothing as soon as you buy it. Physical carts/discs OTOH can be sold, so if I really hate the game I won‚Äôt feel the same kind of buyer‚Äôs remorse that I do when I see the game in my purchase list.
* Promised myself to never beat myself up overly so for a behavior any more. Instead I promised myself to get curious every time and work on strategies to improve, since I know I care about not hurting myself or other people.

Anyway, hope that gives you some ideas!! We‚Äôre not perfect, my doctors remind me that relapse is expected. Upward progress always involves some steps back; it‚Äôs more important to keep moving forward and making adjustments while accepting that mistakes will be made."

[edit] people like to throw around that quote, ‚Äúblood is thicker than water‚Äù. The full quote is actually ‚Äúthe blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.‚Äù That gave me some strength."
RationalPsychonaut,fnq7xpj,t1_fnc08oc,1587159405.0,"Hey thanks for the tag!! I‚Äôm definitely bored and I love philosophy :) Sounds like we are wandering into phenomenology for sure here. It‚Äôs been a really long time since I read Hegel or Heidegger (about 10 years) but I remember really enjoying learning about the experience of experiencing. 

The one element lacking from Heidegger and Hegel is about pondering the actual neural structure of our brains. I am FASCINATED by the idea of the basal ganglia, which is one of our more primordial structures in our brains: according to Charles Duhigg it‚Äôs basically like a chip that stores basic programs in our brain for fulfilling our basic needs (Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy type of needs: food, social connection, rest, reproduction, safety). There are cues in our environment and our body that prompt behaviors to seek out that reward. Even though rewards are physical, they manifest in chemical ways in our brain: social connection and cuddling generate oxytocin, for example. 

Then there‚Äôs the amygdala: we actually respond to things emotionally first before we do so cognitively because of how we‚Äôre wired. Additionally, we make choices emotionally ‚Äî examples of people who were injured seem to indicate that if we don‚Äôt experience emotions, we have huge troubles making even the simplest of decisions. (Check out Antonio Damasio‚Äôs work, or this Wiki article: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emotions_in_decision-making)

Additionally, we now know more about how important our early childhood is in forming our later experiences and interpretations of the world. As a baby we apparently experience little separation between ourselves and the world, which to me sounds an awful lot like the state a neuroscientist experienced while having a stroke (‚ÄúMy Stroke of Insight‚Äù, by Jill Bolte Taylor, PHD) ‚Äî since one side of her brain was offline (the left side with language etc), she felt totally at one with the world and felt very little separation between herself and other individuals. In this state as babies, we use our caretakers as our model for how to see ourselves and the world. If our caretakers typically react to the world with fear, then when they react to us with fear we internalize that: we are to be feared, the world is scary, we are not good, etc. etc. If our caretakers typically react to the world with curiosity, we will feel inherently good, inherently convinced of our own self worth. 

OK and then on top of that, we know more about epigenetic traits: how environmental pressures shape our gene expression. Research so far on mice, holocaust survivors, etc indicates that we can learn to be fearful of certain environmental pressures without having been directly introduced to that environment. This might explain why depression is hereditary. 

All of this is to say that how I think of human experience has totally changed. I‚Äôm starting to believe that human experience is primarily defined by our memory: both the cultural memories that are imposed on us through symbolism/custom and biology, and the memories we have growing up. This means memory is not just about time on earth but all of the hundreds of thousands of years of cultural history before us: we‚Äôre always in conversation with the past. Personally, when I‚Äôm trying to learn a new lesson, or when I‚Äôm applying a lesson to an experience, I usually call up the memory of the specific person and situation that gave rise to that lesson. When I experience untoward amounts of guilt and fear I remember how my dad treated me growing up and it starts to make sense: the templates that he gave me continued to be applied in my daily life, often to my detriment, so now I have to actively work to change those templates. And now I know that he treated me like that because people treated HIM like that, and his parents were subject to violent pressures before him while growing up, and so on and so on. TL;DR each human is an assemblage of the memories that came before them both biologically and culturally. The cultural is biological when it gets encoded in our genes and our instinctual behaviors, which we contagiously share with others. Do we have a unique consciousness and personality outside of these cultural memories? Is that really all that important? Is there a biological basis for past lives? (I think so.) My humor comes from my mom; my fight for justice comes (ironically) from my dad; my curiosity to try new things comes from my ‚Äúother‚Äù dad; and so and so on; but when these people collided in unexpected ways, something new was made (me) that combines all of these traits selectively. I‚Äôm not wholly original but I‚Äôm also not wholly the same as everyone else. 

This biological notion of human memory and symbolism strongly reminds me of a siphonophore. From Wikipedia: ‚ÄúDespite its appearance, the Portuguese man o' war differs from most animals called jellyfish which are single organisms. The Portuguese man o' war is classified as a siphonophore, a colonial organism made up of many specialized parts called zooids.[9] These zooids are attached to one another, physiologically integrated and cannot survive independently. The assemblage of zooids works together to function as an individual animal.‚Äù (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_man_o'_war) Just like humans and the earth, we are all tightly integrated into one experience; we couldn‚Äôt survive as we do now without each other filling in specific roles and passing down certain lessons, and we‚Äôre always rejiggering the system: feudalism, communism, capitalism. Humanity is effectively one organism: we‚Äôre like a giant colony of yeast lol, and our social evolution is as much a part of our bodies as is our vestigial organs.

So back to the concept of truth...well, as human creatures we all strive for a point of reference from which to make decisions. That to me is what ‚Äútruth‚Äù is. As to which point of reference is ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù, well...LOL. I took a whole class on this and I guess my notion of truth is defined by scientific absolutism: making decisions within the scientific truths we know yet guided by our values on the kind of life we want to live. IMHO we would all be happier if we organized our society around respect for our various biological functionings instead of around the pursuit of things like money and perfection. Alas now we‚Äôve got all of these clouded symbols and cultural metaphors that now prevent us from moving on (like ‚Äúsin‚Äù), albeit they did help us get this far.

We know time is relative, so it would make sense that outside of light itself, everything else is also relative, including the truth. Maybe ‚Äútruth‚Äù is just an arbitrary and convenient reference point made up to help us human organisms make decisions; truth is our body and our family and our familiar traditions that help us stay in tune with our social group; everything else outside that is unknown. Ultimately, as a species ‚Äî as a siphonophore ‚Äî it‚Äôs up to us to decide which values we want to carry into the future, which biological truths we want to acknowledge, and how we forsee our ‚Äúend goal‚Äù. According to this YouTube video, life will only exist for essentially a very short blink of time: https://youtu.be/uD4izuDMUQA Unless we can find a way out of our universe, that is. Should that be our goal? If we do streamline all of our behaviors in line with our biological truth as human organisms, will we maintain a sustainable ecosystem until the end of time in our universe? Would that be a good thing? 

My goal for humanity is for all of us to live in balance with our environment (and each other) so that as many people as possible can experience the sensuous joys of being alive during the time that our universe can sustain us. That‚Äôs my truth."
RationalPsychonaut,fnq1myd,t1_fn7e7b3,1587155975.0,"Hi!! Sorry I took a long time to respond to this...I‚Äôve been mulling the best way to communicate the metaphors. Hopefully you‚Äôll still see this :)

**Hitting High Notes:** My choir teacher used to tell us: if you‚Äôre struggling to hit high notes, you need to imagine that you‚Äôre landing on top of the note, not coming to it from below. Imagine that you‚Äôre a hot air balloon, or that you‚Äôre jumping down from a mountain, or you‚Äôre like a flying squirrel landing on top of the note. Whichever you prefer ;) _What‚Äôs probably actually happening when you imagine this metaphor is that you‚Äôre redirecting the air into your sinuses and nasal chambers. (More on this below)_

**Modifying your tone:** Choir teacher used to tell the altos to ‚Äúsing like chocolate‚Äù, and the sopranos to ‚Äúsing like vanilla‚Äù. It worked LOL. _What‚Äôs probably happening here is you‚Äôre using your teeth, tongue, soft palate, and lips to create a different, darker tone, and you‚Äôre probably also using your lower chambers in your body more. (More on this below.)_

**Finding Good Support:** The metaphor I use here is that your diaphragm ‚Äî the muscle that‚Äôs right below your lungs and controls your breathing ‚Äî is like your hand, and your lungs are like a water bottle. Your tone, volume, the length of your note ‚Äî imagine those like the stream of water coming out of the water bottle that you‚Äôre squeezing with your hand. Imagine that around the tip of the water bottle where the water comes out, that‚Äôs where the vocal chords are - sometimes when you squeeze a water bottle it also makes a noise when the pressure of the water/air is enough to vibrate the plastic at the tip of the water bottle, this is basically what you‚Äôre doing with your vocal chords. If you need help finding this feeling, I highly recommend lying on the floor and breathing in and out, and trying to say ‚ÄúHA‚Äù as loudly as possible. You should start to notice on the floor that you can fill up your lungs all the way like a long bag of air, and that most of the pressure and control in breathing comes from the tire ‚Äî the diaphragm ‚Äî around your middle. You should breathe in and imagine that you‚Äôre filling up a big tire full of air around your middle, and when you breathe out your are slowly pushing that tire to deflation. One of my choir teachers recommended panting like a dog to get a sense of your diaphragm/strengthen it buuuut I can‚Äôt say this is my favorite exercise cuz it gets tiring REAL quickly XD and it‚Äôs kind of demeaning...lol

**Understanding the Voice/Body as an Instrument:** OK think about an acoustic guitar, or a piano, or a flute. These instruments all have big empty spaces in them where the sound resonates. Your body also has big empty chambers that affect the sound of your singing: in your chest, your throat, your mouth (can be adjusted in size using your tongue, your teeth, your soft palate ‚Äî the place where the roof of your mouth turns from bone to soft tissue), your nose, and the sinuses to the right and left of your nose and in your brow. (Highly recommend consulting a picture of your anatomy if you are unfamiliar). Once you‚Äôve got your water bottle under control, your next goal is to learn how to direct sound into the different chambers for maximum effect. When you use the flying squirrel metaphor to land on top of a note, you‚Äôre redirecting air into your sinuses where it can best resonate. TL;DR: higher notes need to resonate in the higher chambers of your body, lower notes go into the lower chambers. I like to imagine this as ‚Äúmaking space‚Äù for the notes. You might‚Äôve heard of ‚Äúchest voice‚Äù and ‚Äúhead voice‚Äù, IMHO it‚Äôs all about the chambers in your body.

**Myths: Things that new singers might presume are ‚Äúeasy‚Äù but are actually skills that you can practice: **
* basic breathing ‚Äî most people learn to breath from their chest, but you need to breathe from your belly (I think what this means is most people don‚Äôt practice fully inflating their lungs or using the diaphragm to really control the escape of air from their body)
* singing high and quietly ‚Äî requires extra diaphragm control in my experience to both maintain the note and keep the right supply of air under pressure to keep it going.
* singing on pitch ‚Äî lots of downstream stuff can affect your pitch, including your air pressure and the shape of your mouth while singing. VERY FEW PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY TONE DEAF. This condition is called amusia. If you‚Äôre unable to sing on pitch but you can hear pitch, my guess is that you likely just need a little bit more training and/or vocal care to produce accurate pitches. 
* singing with other people ‚Äî usually comes out better if y‚Äôall are using the same vowels and allowing the air to flow freely. I think that‚Äôs why groups of siblings sound so great singing together, because they all grew up with the same phonemes and so when they harmonize it‚Äôs actually in pitch and sounds great.

**Things which can affect your singing:**
* Anything that creates inflammation in your sinuses, throat, and nose, like (silent) acid reflux (LPR), getting a cold, etc. This is because inflammation can both affect the size of your sinuses and the airflow into them.
* Lack of water ‚Äî try drinking tons of water over 1 - 2 days and then sing. It‚Äôs an incredible feeling ^^ Your vocal chords need to be hydrated for maximum flexibility and power. 
* Not warming up ‚Äî your vocal chords are like muscles that need to be warmed up too, so do some gentle ‚Äústretches‚Äù (exercises) before you launch into belting

LMK if you have any questions, this turned into a LONG post üòÖ I love singing and truly believe anyone* can do it (unless you have amusia or some other kind of neurological condition that affects your muscle control, of course). [edited for formatting]

So glad you‚Äôre experiencing the sublime joys of singing üòä Honestly I recommend singing anything you‚Äôre excited about, positive reinforcement is the best way to get where you‚Äôre going and enjoy the journey also."

Is religion a metaphor or is it truth? Someone once said that religion must be repeating itself again and again because it‚Äôs a powerful survival tool. To me it‚Äôs a really powerful metaphor for modifying your bodily chemistry; for helping humans withstand the pressure of fear; and for concretizing certain traditions to protect humans in a way humans would understand, before we had science to give us a smaller picture of the world. Just like the placebo effect, religion works in real ways.

There were some early moments in my life where I prayed to God/Jesus and felt this intense joy and sense of love from him. Later on as I developed my self-worth, I learned to feel the same joy from the same place in my body. Martin Luther (16th century) was always on about how we could find God inside of ourselves, and I think he‚Äôs entirely right.

it is especially horrifying that the least protected workers are deemed the most essential. and yet they are the ones with the capricious bosses, who have to show up on time to things, who have to sacrifice their health without insurance, who have to live really far away from where they work, who have to live in communities that were underfunded/exploited by redlining, and they‚Äôre supposed to be grateful for that.

One thing I LOVED about the first season of Great British Bake-off available on Netflix (the season with Martha Collison) is that they took the time to profile all of the bakers with video shorts, and many of them had working class jobs and seemed relatively happy. So happy they had time to practice their baking in between episodes and act so relaxed and in reserve on the show.

It‚Äôs still vibrating with me...thank you for wording this how you did OP, this was really helpful."

Growing up I really struggled with my self-image. I always thought I was obese, for some reason, even though looking back I was a perfectly normal weight. Now I AM overweight and trying to craft a new lifestyle which will lead to less weight.

I think that‚Äôs the key: creating a new life. You probably won‚Äôt be able to do that overnight or while in quarantine, especially given all the extra stress we‚Äôre under, but you might be able to take some steps to help yourself out. I‚Äôm guessing part of your revulsion is from panic; it‚Äôs OK to slow down. It‚Äôs hard to make big changes like diet overnight, because it involves so many invisible changes: new routine, new foods, new skills to prep the food, finding a new place to buy the food you like, planning your food, managing your emotional triggers for food, learning what you like, etc etc. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up for not being able to do it by the end of quarantine :)

Right now I would focus less on the idea of punishing yourself and more towards making new choices you enjoy. Otherwise you might spend a lot of time beating yourself up for expectations that might be difficult to meet. My new motto is not to punish myself. No matter what. Just focus on getting to know myself and making choices that I know take care of me.

For these reasons, I‚Äôd recommend learning from a book that takes a more neutral and informative approach to nutrition, without value judgments. I really liked ‚ÄúFitness For Geeks‚Äù by Make: Magazine because it shows you the big picture of how many common and fad diets compare (turns out they are all just different ratios of the three basic macronutrients: protein, fat, and carbohydrates) and explains the science of nutrition. Things like how sugar works in your body; different types of plans other nerds have tried; etc. I‚Äôm not really doing it justice lol. It emphasizes choosing what works for you and gives you the understanding to make that choice.

Practically speaking, try to stay away from processed sugar (sugar industry paid a Harvard scientist to lie in 1964 and say that fat, not sugar, is ‚Äúevil‚Äù, BUT fat is one of the three basic macronutrients...here we are in the present) but don‚Äôt give yourself a hard no on anything. We all harbor this unconscious bias to do the opposite of something if we tell ourselves we can never have it again. It‚Äôs OK to have something you like and you should tell yourself after you‚Äôve eaten it that you‚Äôll have it again one day.

Internal work: I would try to confront your feelings about your body. Really try to see it the way it is instead of how you imagine. Meditate on the revulsion you‚Äôre feeling and follow it to the source. Learn about all the cool things the human body does to keep you healthy. Try to shift from taking actions based on fear to actions driven from curiosity. Don‚Äôt try to make yourself not feel anything; just listen to it and respect those feelings. Seek to understand them; negotiate with them like setting time limits for how long we‚Äôre going to worry or be mad at ourself for x thing. Fear and anger can be helpful tools for self-protection, but for folks like us we usually need to learn how to use them more intentionally.

Since we‚Äôre in quarantine, look into High Intensity exercise; it‚Äôs this theory that short bursts of exercise can be really beneficial. I like this theory because it makes me feel good about doing a goal I can probably achieve (doing 10 pushups or some squats) instead of setting myself up to fail with a gym membership.


And finally, I‚Äôd check out the science of habit formation, specifically the cue-reward loop. We all have these loops that operate out of our basal ganglia; we can change the behavior to meet the reward, but we can‚Äôt change our need for it. (‚ÄúReward‚Äù meaning, physiological need like serotonin, blood sugar, etc). I REALLY liked The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg; first couple of chapters were enough to get the message IMHO. It looks like a B.S. business book but it‚Äôs good and, again, focuses on the science of habits.

hope this helps, good luck!!! üòä"

JustNoSO,fmmj78g,t1_fmm3h28,1586206246.0,"having an alcoholic and abusive controlling father totally explains it!! i think having a kid can make things worse because it brings up old behavior patterns and old memories of how her dad mistreated her, stuff she‚Äôs likely not taken time to grieve or actually get mad about.

Here‚Äôs that list I mentioned down below (in my way too long post lol); if you think she‚Äôs open to it, ask her if anything sounds familiar. (Source: Pete Walker, ‚ÄúThe Tao of Fully Feeling‚Äù.)
