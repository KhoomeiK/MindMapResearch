offmychest,fpagf71,t3_gbtblt,1588447638.0,"I say hang in there bud. The thing with life is you never know when things are gonna turn around and personally for me, it has when I needed it most and at times last minute. Trust life will get better and do the best you can with what you got. Stay strong! :)"
changemyview,fnwkxfa,t1_fnvylne,1587320357.0,"You sir/madam are good at explaining things. What makes me believe in God and that Jesus is God is through personal experience and the experience of others. Sadly, that can't be proven to others and shown so called physical evidence cause it already happened and no one was recording it in anyway and whatever we do tell them won't qualify as their type of evidence. Main draw away is to do seek to have a personal relationship with God and your personal evidence will trump all others with an argument who hasn't experienced what you have or seen what you have. All the best."
changemyview,fn74ven,t3_fzxsfq,1586713332.0,"Good people of reddit, if you really wanna know how true or real God is and who is the true and living God. Do some digging, listen to people's experiences and things people have gone through. A man with experience is not at the mercy of a man with an argument. Real talk people. Get your own personal experience with God and go and experience it yourself. Look up John Ramirez  and see another side of life you probably never knew existed. Be encouraged and try and get your lives in order."

Honestly I've taken the approach to make do with what I have and I'm gonna save and save and save til I have a huge amt of diamonds and just get by with what I have and use who I like that works well. THEN, when I'm satisfied I'll and see what I want I'll draw then max out that servant."

After I do now service and learn more skills and get experience, I'll be more marketable and will be able to get various jobs. 

Keep up the faith guys and just do what you gotta do to get where you wanna get."

MirageMemorialGlobal,fem20kv,t3_eposib,1579237166.0,"Honestly, if you can find other good servants to fill the other rolls, get your asoka up. She's OP and deals so much dmg. Seth is great but only for a physical team so it really depends on what type of team your going for and who and who you can afford to lose out on to gain on someone else.

 Ofc in the long run,  the longer you play the better and better your options get and you'll be able to pick choose and refuse. Even more so if you spend money on the game. Play long enough and you'll achieve so much like you'll never believe. 

Alas, it all depends on the type of team you wish to build and whether your p2p or f2p."
