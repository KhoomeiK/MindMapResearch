I’m (26F) currently dating (24M) and he exhibits some of the traits you described.

&nbsp;

I can’t tell if it’s the normal self-centeredness from being a younger millennial. I’ve experienced a lot of hardship early on as a kid, and throughout most of my adult life.
&nbsp;

It’s difficult for me to relate to people from a more privileged/sheltered background.

If I were you, there are some great books on narcissism in people and romantic relationships that help with recovery.

Let me know if you want me to pm you."

“I’m blown away that you thought this was appropriate. What does your wife think? Are you going to tell her about this? What part of me constantly talking about [Fiancé] and our wedding gave you anything to misread? What made you think I would keep a text like that from him? I thought we were coworkers becoming friends but obviously I also misread the situation. You need to keep it strictly professional with me from now on. If you ever bring this up again, I will have to report it.”

relationship_advice,es4l9ge,t3_c5rn6a,1561587490.0,"It sounds like your female friends are jealous and emotionally immature. Rather than accepting your decision and respecting it, they are being disrespectful and insulting by calling it “creepy.” It’s not inappropriate or weird. A “Maid of Honor” or “Man of Honor” should be someone who made a significant HONORABLE difference in your life. Your female friends are letting their egos and pride be their priority rather than respecting the fact, that this is YOUR WEDDING, not theirs! They weren’t there for you all those years when you needed someone. 

&nbsp;

I personally think your reasoning for choosing your brother is heart-warming. He made a big difference in your life when you. If I was in your shoes, I would have done the same."
relationship_advice,erulstl,t3_c3v32h,1561287220.0,"This post was so painful to read. :(

&nbsp;

OP, throwaway_1212452 ,
You have been through so much trauma. The environment you are in is extremely toxic.

&nbsp;

There’s nothing wrong with having a preference for dominant women, but before you have any kind of a romantic relationship, you need to start healing yourself with help from a professional.

&nbsp;

I know you have strong feelings of love and attachment, but in this situation, YOU CANNOT TRUST WHAT YOU FEEL, since your internal radar for danger, has been corrupted by the traumatic abusive behavior, of your parents towards you.

&nbsp;

I’m going to assume this is a genuine post, the desperation and sadness in it seems real, even as far-fetched and completely extreme the story seems.

&nbsp;
For you and anyone else who might in a similar situation, I am going to state and number each obvious red flag.

Red Flag #1
Her baggage, now what do I mean by this? If someone has a significant amount of trauma, you have to ask yourself... Is this person working hard to heal and grow, to become a better, stronger, healthier person? 

&nbsp;
If the answer is “No,” RUN.

&nbsp;
A person who has been abused, has a HIGHER likelihood of BECOMING abusive to the people closest to them, because their trauma is untreated. That being said, if someone IS abusive, RUN.

 Red Flag #2: the age gap. 
The fact that you were severely sheltered, isolated, and abused, means you are not at the same maturity level, when you were 17, when you INITIALLY met her. The average 25-year-old HEALTHY woman, is NOT interested in underage teenagers, because it is a completely different stage of life. Once again, RUN

&nbsp;

Red Flag #3 : Violence
She pulled a knife on you, that is a blatant act of violence, she endangered your life. She almost took away any chance you have of healing and experiencing true inner peace and happiness. A person who TRULY loves you WOULD NEVER PULL A KNIFE ON YOU AND THREATEN YOU. 
Please please please SAVE YOURSELF, preserve your life, run as far and as fast as you can!!!!


&nbsp;
Red Flag #4 : She is Addicted to a Hard Drug.
Heroin, seriously. That’s a hard drug, that’s the kind of drug, they requires in person rehabilitation for YEARS. Please get away from this person. Drug Addicts that are addicted to hard drugs (heroin, meth, bath salts, etc), are unstable, prone to violence, and more. PLEASE GET OUT NOW.

&nbsp;

Red Flag #5 : Bad Hygiene
Again this just further points to her being an unstable, unhealthy human being. If you really truly want to heal, you MUST surround yourself with healthier/healthy people. SHE IS NOT A RECOVERED DRUG ADDICT IN THERAPY, get out NOW! Her bad hygiene is just a visible sign of how incredibly toxic and dysfunctional she really is.

&nbsp;
A truly healthy Dominant woman takes pride in all aspects of her life, and above all, she doesn’t just “live” she THRIVES. This is not a good relationship. Please get out and focus on healing and recovering from the trauma you have been through.

&nbsp;

Red Flag #7 Inappropriate Flirting
She is purposefully remaining in contact and disrespecting your dysfunctional toxic relationship. If someone really loved you, in a HEALTHY LOYAL WAY, they would never EVER do this to you.

Red Flag #8 : Confronting her on the Beginning 
The fact that she becomes visibly anxious and agitated when you confront her about the beginning of your involvement, and whether or not she is a predator, says a lot.

&nbsp;

There’s a reason your brain had the question “Is she a predator? Is she taking advantage of me?,” because SHE IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF YOU AND SHE IS A PREDATOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

&nbsp;

Please OP.
I know this is hard.
I know it’s hard to let go of what is familiar, even when it’s toxic, but you have to believe in yourself and in your future. 

&nbsp;

The beautiful thing about the brain, is neuroplasticity. Your brain isn’t carved in stone, it can grow, change, adapt, and heal. By leaving this dysfunctional, toxic, abusive, LETHAL environment, you are giving yourself the power and freedom to create a healthy, peaceful, structured, clean, healing environment for yourself.

&nbsp;
Sending love to you OP.
Feel free to pm me.  

&nbsp;

I hope this helps."

Congrats OP"
relationships,erjqpdf,t3_c265ob,1560943325.0,"It’s an unfortunate situation, but if I were you, I would focus on your career. This is complicated because he is your friend and coworker and you know his wife.

&nbsp;

Men like him are very common in the music/entertainment industry, speaking as a woman having been propositioned by these, ugh, individuals.

&nbsp; 

He will eventually face the consequences of his actions, and I promise you the wife already suspects. 

&nbsp;

Preserve your future, don’t say a word to anyone, especially since what you did is illegal in most countries. 

&nbsp;

Focus on building your career so you are completely independent someday. If you two were just friends, with no career ties, I would say tell the wife. 

&nbsp;

However... He chose to do what he did. You shouldn’t throw your whole career away because of him.

&nbsp;

However I will say this, anyone whom you date in the future, especially intelligent women, will pick up on those traits, and they will consider and wonder how that influences you. 

&nbsp;

Be careful OP, you accidentally opened a closet full of skeletons. Whatever he did, he will do again, and he will get caught. Just walk away, consider whether you want this person in your life in the long run, and most of all, build your career and independence.

&nbsp;

If he can’t even be loyal to the MOTHER of his kids, how long before he throws you under the bus? Not saying it will happen, and I’m not saying it won’t. 

&nbsp;

This is a loss for everyone because of his actions.
You lose the positive perception you had of your close friend/coworker.
The wife getsher heart broken (and potentially is at risk for STD’s) and could jeopardize her business.

&nbsp;

He made this pile of shit, not you.
Clean your shoe and walk away."

It will not get better.
He will not change.

Your health and well-being is what REALLY matters.

Dump him and go to therapy please.
