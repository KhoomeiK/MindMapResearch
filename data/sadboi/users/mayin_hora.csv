If I had joined the Coast Guard at 20 years old I would have had boating experience and pursued a life on the water at a younger age. Or I could have worked harder on the teaching certificate and be retired by now. As it was, I was depressed from 12 until now (57) but I go to therapy and take meds to help me out. I'm teaching and hope to live on a sailboat someday. I don't regret my past, but try to help others find a way. My son is 21 and hasn't a clue. I think he's a pothead. Fine, move Cali or Colo and work the industry. He has many more talents but count anger among his issues.

FWIW I didn't pursue counseling until 35 and didn't start meds until 40. Started teaching at 44 and been happiest there. Don't rush yourself. Drugs and alcohol only make you more depressed (I drank too much when young, didn't help).
