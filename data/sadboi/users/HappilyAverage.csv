TeddyBearGarden,fr1vban,t3_gm5cxe,1589826555.0,Please will you ask the people who do this to carry on after everything gets back to normal. (if it ever does!). I love them. In a town near me someone has a monkey tree and they dress up monkeys every now and again and put them in the tree. It always brightens my day when I drive past.
TeddyBearGarden,fqwn2r0,t3_glcmhr,1589710585.0,I really love these. They brighten my day. Please let the people who are doing this know how much pleasure they bring to an internet strangers day.
manchester,fquf8uh,t3_gky2pj,1589657882.0,Love this. It brings me joy that people would spend time and come together to save a duck.
BritishSuccess,fqee404,t1_fqcvt3r,1589306042.0,I rang today to arrange priority booking for someone who is vulnerable and was told that they don’t release them at midnight. They said it would take 48 hours before they were on the priority list and it still could be a week before they got a slot. Just thought I’d look and there was one booking left for 9am tomorrow. I was so excited for them it took me half an hour to calm down and order for them.

SuperMorbidlyObese,foq3vwv,t3_g8qjgi,1587982058.0,"On Reddit I often see a post and laugh because I think ‘omg I thought I was the only one who did that’. This post made my heart race. I could have written it. Everyone thinks that I have just got boring. I used to go away for weekends, nights out. I was up for anything. Now I just want to be on my own. I terrified that if I’m walking with someone they will walk too fast or there will be a slight incline and I will be gasping for breath. I might see someone I haven’t seen for ages and they will be disgusted at the state I have got myself in. I hate that I have to buy clothes just because they fit and I feel like I might as well just wear a sack. My feet hurt all the time. If I walk too far my back kills. Chairs!!! As you say I then go home, stuff my face and have a bottle of wine because then at least I can escape for I few hours. That you so much for posting"

thewestwing,fm264gg,t1_fm1x6td,1585691299.0,I agree. I think Toby is frustrated because he knows how special president Bartlet would be if Bartlet could just let Bartlet be Bartlet

secretsanta,fk1f5mb,t3_ffz7ie,1583778419.0,"On Saturday morning I looked at my 18 year old cat and for the first time he looked old. You know how old cats look. A bit scraggy , thin with a greasy coat. It really upset me. A few minutes later there was a knock on my door. It was the post man with my gift. All the gifts are lovely but the one that really got to me was the mug. My boy is ginger so it felt like he had sent it to me. I know a lot of people on Reddit say that something has made them cry but that really did. I cried a lot and hugged my boy. I can’t thank you enough or tell you how special I found all your gifts. Thank you from the bottom of my heart x"

AMA,fhsbx2a,t3_f3hcea,1581858171.0,"I have really loved your positive posts at such a dreadful and I am sure frightening time. It is really refreshing to see. In today’s social media 99% of the time people would use a situation like this to show their moral outrage at everyone and everything. Your reporting has been interesting, informative and at times funny. I wish you and your wife all the luck in the world and please post a picture of you and your pup when you eventually get reunited. Health and happiness to you both"
secretsanta,fg67nr8,t3_ex0vtw,1580557794.0,My rematch Santa pulled my info on the 2nd of January but there has been nothing since. Don’t let it put you off. I’ve taken part in a few exchanges. This is the first time I haven’t received anything. Who knows what is going on in their lives. Don’t get me wrong I’m a little bit gutted but I also really enjoyed trying to get my match something I hoped they would like.

BritishSuccess,fculojz,t3_eivpj8,1577983726.0,The problem with this is if you work Christmas. I work in social care and if Christmas is on a weekend you only got paid the week enhancement +0.33. But then people who work on the bank holidays get +0.5. So you either have to work every bloody day to get anything extra or work Christmas for the usual pay.
ZenHabits,fcmkj3a,t1_fcmj0g8,1577779067.0,Perhaps our New Years resolution should be to go through our saved list and actually read them. I do it in real life as well. I have a stack of really interesting books on my coffee table. I haven’t read any but you never know! :)

secretsanta,fbxf1va,t1_fbwft99,1577184017.0,Same for me. My Santa pulled my info on the 2nd but nothing since. But I joined secret Santa to give as much as to receive. I’ve enjoyed trying to get something I think they will like. As for my Santa I have no idea what may be going on in their life. Anything could have happened. So I am not bothered by it at all and still hope they got something nice

britishproblems,f9kt5nc,t1_f9ksjqs,1575407365.0,Well I truly get that. It drives me mad that winter clothes are in the shops in July just as the temperature reaches 30 degrees. You have held on to warm clothes because it only just got past 10 degrees in June then there is not a summer frock in sight. All year clothes and accessories is a must in the global climate crisis. Get on line to find your shades and wear them with pride my friend.
thewestwing,f9ks44g,t3_e5h9bx,1575406759.0,I watch this before looking at the sub. As soon as a watch it I knew where I was.
