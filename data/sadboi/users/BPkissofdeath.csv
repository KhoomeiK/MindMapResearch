I’m not a doctor and I wouldn’t use my advice in pursuit of treatment. But if you’re not certain it is helping, and that that exact dose is what is doing, I’d suggest going slow. An example, increase 25 mg a month but not more than 100mg total in a calendar year.

Took me months and months to get off an recover. Online Lamictal has been worse. It’s been 5 months and I’m still only 3/4 of the way done. Panic on panic on panic. Wahoo!

Pm anytime for longer stories."

There was a weird mental space during those times. I wanted to quit, even if it meant not living, but that not being an option, I begrudgingly pushed myself through. It really did feel like running into a wall for a decade.

Just so you know.

This is year 4 for me with a bipolar diagnosis. I had a good moment with a friend just this week.

He's a doctor, and I've never asked him a medical question in ... 11 years (fuuuuuccckkk). LSS - had Klonopin for 60 days. My physical manifestation of anxiety (nausea near solar plexus - unknown to me until this week) came right back, with a vengeance. I thought it was the answer, after a few years of drugs. It was the only thing, the only thing, that has stopped that feeling. Since I was 4-5. I'm a slow learner but damn I'm slower than a shell with no snail. 

Withdraws sucked. Just like any other withdraw. For me it's panic attacks, stomach discomfort, dry heaving, and an overwhelming feeling of hopelessness.

Hopelessness, unbeknownst to me, was/is a large part of my life. This past week I had enough and needed a trusted friend. I finally asked J, and he was just as great as he always is. He listened and asked direct questions. He found my manifestation odd; doctor curiosity engaged!

He got right into it. With rotations in psych wards (omg fuck that experience in particular) he was a stanch advocate of cutting Klonopin immediately. I had stopped a week prior, and told him after he had said that. Immediately he asks - how are the withdraws so far? (In my head I was blown away) . They suck. 

Next he says cut that 100mg of Seroquel. Next - a direct quote - ""If I were your doctor I would literally prescribe 30-45 min of HR above 150, 4-6 times per week, doing whatever doesn’t cause you pain."" 

Talk about an incapsulating quote. Old Army buddy, so he knows all too well what I was (and maybe still am?) capable of. I can and will do this. 5:30 miles? Helllllll no. But I can still run. I can walk if I have to. And shit you can really crawl if you have to. 500 meters of low crawling (all body parts touching the ground. ALL.) with your face IN THE SAND (everybody say aahhhh). You'd be surprised by how many people suck at crawling. Grown men that signed up for a mouth full of sand, still getting whooped.

I just heard myself; adults suck at crawling. We go from extreme emotion then to managing emotions and right to the off-button if it gets bad.

These grown men couldn't crawl. I'm talking brick shithouses ready to do whatever the hell they are legally, morally, and ethically asked to do in the middle of trying to keep their buddy alive.

You are the same human as they are. The same human as I am. All unique, yes. All human, yes.

Might I propose that you actually crawl around. Go from your bedroom to the next room. Just one time. You do what you want, as always, I just want to help.

You can crawl, you can crawl, you can crawl. You don't have to stop. You should stop when you need, but otherwise **I’d** say no. It has cost me months of time. Months!!!! We only get 1200, if we are lucky.

After the talk, the intensity of my symptoms dropped for hours, que realization: there's a chance this is physical anxiety. I can crawl towards this realization. Fuck me this sand sucks! But I'm still gonna crawl. 

Tommorow morning I'm going to scare the shit out of my doctor and tell him my plan, looking for direct feedback. I'll crawl, but not into a land mine; his (psychiatrist's) advice is paramount.

Don't hold this inside. We are here, including your own support system. A support system is just that: support. Don't hide from these loved ones. And if you don't have a loved one, I'll fly to you with a bag full of sand.

PM me anytime, as many times as you need. I had loved ones lock up my personal weapons because I actually considered suicide. I took a pistol out a month ago and it needed to go right back. I won't do it, but I need more time to crawl until I'm sure.

I like to be transparent where I can: I couldn't stop the tears as I read over this post. This period in my life has sucked more than anything I've encountered. And I'm still here. I had a moment one day out there in the world. I finally knew I wasn't going to do it. It has entered my mind even after that moment, and it seemed the best option over and over, but you know what? I looked up and literally screamed, ""Fucking bring it!!!"" If I'm going to go through this, then bring it on. I couldn't find another answer. I still can't. I'll learn to learn better, and get this shit to atleast manageable.

Lastly,

I want to say: Human, I love you. Can't stop me."
