Hang in there man. Congrats on finishing your PhD!! That’s AMAZING!!! 

I just finished my bachelors (took me over 7 years, not cause I’m stupid, but because, well, you know, bp (recently diagnosed bp 1 after full blown delusional manic episode, had to —forced too rather—go to pysch ward for a week)) and man it’s awesome accomplishment. My dad won’t talk to me, he thinks the whole manic episode was ‘an act’ and I was just ‘seeking attention.’  Don’t get me started.... 

But you should be happy for yourself man!! That’s a HELL of an accomplishment and if your parents don’t support you—FUCK EM—-cause I do, and all the people here do too. You deserve to be lauded for your victories the same as anybody else. Just cause we’re a little cuckoo doesn’t mean we don’t deserve love and respect. 

Stay strong."
