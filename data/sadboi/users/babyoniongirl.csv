Especially when I go out with friends, I can never stay too late because I feel I need to make sure I have time to do my routine and decompress.  I can also never crash at friends houses over night, i HAVE to go home.   but often times I go home and feel very lonely."

I've been on metformin for a long but I have also suffered from gum and teeth sensitivity.  when I was younger and i didnt brush twice a day and floss every day, i developed gingivitis.  its actually very common.  I dont wanna be *that* person, but flossing is actually important... once you do some research about how much shit gets stuck in your teeth you will never stop flossing lol.  good luck! i know how painful it is"

BPD,eyxdltm,t3_cz7fiz,1567550695.0,"I used to do this a lot, and I think I still do I just dont like talking to strangers that much.  But things would come out of my mouth and as they did, internally i would be like ""wtf??"" but I just couldn't stop myself.  sometimes it would be really embarrassing.  But i think I would also make close friends that way because people felt like they could talk to me.  Idk what it is.. but sometimes I really hate myself for it."

90DayFiance,ey5rqd5,t3_cvh21r,1566838790.0,"on a surface level it's really easy to feel bad for the guy because he doesn't seem like a bad dude,  but he is in a ""relationship"" with a girl just because of how she looks.  but when you start to dissect who he is, he just wants a hot trophy wife and when he realized he could never get one in America because he's not good looking, or rich, he basically tried to scam a foreign girl to be his gf. and now he's the one getting scammed.  the dummy could have easily found a nice girl where he lives if he wasn't so shallow and put in the effort to do so.  he wanted a hot piece of meat and now he's paying the price, literally.   seems very misogynistic, and like he watched too much porn lol"
