BP2 doesn’t have the full on mania, so I haven’t had that experience with my lexapro. But I think the looming possibility is probably the reason it’s her goal to get me off of it.  
I also know that it’s better to go down gradually instead of doing to cold turkey thing, so I’m like, do I just tell her I stopped taking it and see what she says? And I wonder if she’ll recommend I go back to my normal dose for a bit before we start decreasing? Idk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Sometimes I wish I was a doctor just so I knew what to do"

He did not take kindly to this response.   
Trust your instincts. Check up on her, even if you aren’t very close. I’m assuming since you mentioned assigned roommates that you might be in college—talk to a counselor if you’re genuinely afraid for her wellbeing. Not much can be done since she’s legally an adult, but you can still make your concerns known.  

Edit: it’s been said here before, but definitely talk to her first. tell her you’re concerned. explain why before you get anyone else involved."
