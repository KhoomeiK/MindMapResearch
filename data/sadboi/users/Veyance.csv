I left a cush salary job as a Data Scientist because I'm just too extrovertive for a desk. Unfortunately with the service industry comes unstable pay and even more unstable job security. 

You simply need to cut all frivolous expenses now that you don't NEED (Eating out of any kind, date night now always features home cooking; you do have a beautiful home after all, anything resembling buying clothes or shoes, alcohol, and the server's drug of choice, the devil's lettuce). Basically anything that doesn't barely feed you, maintain your car, or put a roof on your head, does not get bought until you BOTH have new jobs. Also in the need time you should make sure the man keeps his job in a place that will feel like hell until he leaves, nothing scary should happen. :)

This is my advice. I apologize for the pushy tone but I'm someone that never takes advice so I give it rather forcefully. I do believe you'll be fine.  Don't stress so much on a million possible futures that lie before you.

If you'll pardon the ego (sorry kind of full blown manic right now), I believe I have enough emotional intelligence to know that a majority of the people in the comments that seem to be glorifying mania are either joking or trolling. 

There is no glory in this disorder, but there is glory in shouldering this burden we all share (even if our core personality traits and disorders differ) because this is the only chance at life we get, fucked up brain or not."
