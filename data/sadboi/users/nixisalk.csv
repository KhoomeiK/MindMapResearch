Music,es2eol5,t3_c4qs5p,1561521911.0,"It shows their rhythm section, Mick and John, kickin ass. Off a great album from a great band. Fleetwood Mac‚Äôs hardest rock song but by no means ‚Äúhard rock. Just straight up great music. I always loved Christine McVie best. Sweet music during a divorce. A favorite song of mine because it is rock from a pop band."
schizophrenia,ertrd3p,t1_ero155i,1561250903.0,Thanks. And thanks for telling me about my mistake. Pretty cool that she graduated
schizophrenia,ernzbk4,t1_erm91vu,1561064511.0,Thanks. Did. I‚Äôm not the most tech savvy on this app.
schizophrenia,ernz7tw,t3_bxmfa0,1561064440.0,"I am diagnosed schizoid affective. I receive Social Security Disability pay and work part time. As long as I stay within income guidelines I keep my full benefits. I started out in college after my diagnosis like you, then left to work after 3 years of college. I was a manager in a very successful restaurant for 15 years working part time on disability. Maybe you could do the same. If you can do even some work in your field and get paid that would be cool. I‚Äôm going back to school in the Fall to finish up and will continue to work part time and maintain my disability status with Social Security. Anything over 15-20 hours of work makes my symptoms pretty bad. CONGRATULATIONS on your degree. You‚Äôre a rock star. Schizophrenia isn‚Äôt a death sentence. And we are both proof of that. Good luck going forward. I married a girl that was management for MicroSoft. We can do most anything. But have some limitations others don‚Äôt have. Thanks for sharing your story. You‚Äôre amazing. Your friend , Matt"
schizophrenia,erm44yk,t1_eq9cf0o,1561005475.0,I‚Äôm diagnosed schiziod affective. I went to college following a suicide attempt but left 20 years ago to work. Now I‚Äôm going back to school to get my degree. I get disability pay and just worked part time. If I work much over 20 hours a week my symptoms really get bad. I just had to stay within income guidelines. I was a manager in a very successful restaurant. I‚Äôm not sure about your situation but maybe you could work part time with your degree. But whatever you do- CONGRATULATIONS. College saved my life and gave me some self confidence and pride whenI had next to none. Best wishes on your next adventure
abuse,erdar4a,t3_brjcmu,1560736062.0,"My mom was/ is incredibly self centered and completely immoral. It really affected me growing up and as an adult had to learn to pull away. It was scary and hard at first. She‚Äôs a first class piece of shit. I‚Äôve learned to sorta forgive her at least to not take revenge in verbal ways. But not despising everything she is is impossible. I go to Church and can‚Äôt not hate her or respect her. That‚Äôs been tough to accept. But rules don‚Äôt apply the same to incestuous, abusive shit like her. It actually helps me to be completely honest about my feelings and her behaviors etc. Part of her soul lives on lies and not getting held accountable. And quite frankly God might love her but no one else I know that gets to know her does. Except the people she cons and that‚Äôs not really the same. My whole family including her parents and her 2 ex husbands feel the same. She‚Äôs an amazing actress but once you know the truth can see thru it easy. So she runs way deep in the shadows. But over time she keeps getting exposed. The justice is that she hates herself and is all alone. And all she‚Äôs ever had to really figure out in life was to not be so evil. But she loves it so much. No one can help her but herself now and that seems like a one in a billion chance."
work,erd9fyu,t3_c1cf62,1560734917.0,I‚Äôm someone who loves restaurant work. I went from bussing to hosting to serving and then management. I love all the crazy shit and the people and the whole shit but finally got out because of shitty fellow managers. Management makes all the difference not matter what field you‚Äôre in. Pick a job on great/ good management and it‚Äôs easier. I‚Äôm going back to school to teach. Basically no more business career and kinda my own ‚Äú boss‚Äù . And coworkers you don‚Äôt really work with just in the same building. Plus I love kids more than restaurants and more than $.
work,epxkw91,t3_bw7yfv,1559603540.0,Welcome to a restaurant job. If all that bugs you get a ‚Äúnormal job‚Äù. I was restaurant management for 15 years and worked in the field prior to that. This is all just normal for a restaurant. It‚Äôs kinda crazy. You either love it or it drives you nuts. I love it. But lots of people don‚Äôt. If you just started your job give it 6 months and see if it‚Äôs for you or not. Just my two cents. Good luck on your work life
Christianity,eouc36i,t3_bt3s5k,1558862185.0,"From my personal experience it might sound trite but read the Bible more. It is an integral part of Christianity. Pray, love, go to Church and do all your ‚Äúreal life‚Äù stuff too. But read your Bible. It really does clear up a lot of confusion and answer a lot of questions. It did and does for me. Hope you wind up where you‚Äôre supposed to be in your Faith. My thoughts and prayers for you my friend"
work,eoq3g0k,t3_br26uv,1558783976.0,"I couldn‚Äôt figure out if my GM was lazy or high or both. He is a liar and a coward so I bullied a raise out of him and then later got a better job working for someone else. He‚Äôs delivering pizza nowüòÄ. I‚Äôll bet your colleague isn‚Äôt a genius. Einstein was a genius. Maybe they are stupid, evil and manipulative. But genius isn‚Äôt likely. Piece of shit perhaps."
work,eojna2u,t3_brz7k2,1558640195.0,"Sounds like my ex boss. Couldn‚Äôt solve any problems so put on a smile to try to make us happy. It really was an attempt to cover his total lack of ability. Hard work from smart people is still hard work. Who the hell smiles all day at work. He could accomplish nothing, and smiled while he did nothing. Literally. He didn‚Äôt dare challenge us to work hard and get better. He was a fraud. Mr. Shakespeare had a line about the false face hiding what the false heart knows. I said ex boss and I talked to corporate and ownership about my lousy co-managers. Then I got a new job. My owner is beyond pissed at the people I left behind. Most of them are hopeless at present and hate me. They just can‚Äôt quite suck up the courage to say it. Hope you figure out a way to be happy and still do a great job. After 15 years of restaurant management I‚Äôm going back to school to do something I love. Teaching. There are more employers out there than just for profit businesses. I‚Äôm set financially for life and learned a lot but there is much more to life than money. I always that but thought work should pay well. Really well. Now I am happy to make a little bit less and do something I love and enjoy doing. It‚Äôs just as hard but more meaningful than chasing a dollar."
