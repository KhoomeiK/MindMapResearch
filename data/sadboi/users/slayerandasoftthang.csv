Since I‚Äôm out of province, being in res and meeting people is super important to me-is it worth deferring a year?y only worry is that next session I wouldn‚Äôt be guaranteed res."

relationship_advice,fg6xr92,t3_ewz3oa,1580579332.0,"I hate that this happened to you, I cannot imagine how uncomfortable, unsettling and scary that must‚Äôve been. Girl to girl, I can tell you that this kind of stuff happens way too often, and we must work together to stand up to this harassment and abuse. It sounds like he has a charming, convincing personality (Ted Bundy was as well, just saying) and that he is trying to play this off. I would recommend first talking to your mom about it and telling her everything (and by everything I mean all the little details and how it has impacted you). I would also recommend trying to talk to a counsellor or therapist if possible, as it is often common for assault survivors to feel guilty, or dirty like you mentioned. You are a strong, empowered woman, and I wish you the best."

It‚Äôs all over the news and social media, which makes it so much harder. I struggle with knowing that there are animals without voices suffering and there is nothing I can do, along with the fact that people claim the world is ending. I had a breakdown last night because I felt so powerless."
