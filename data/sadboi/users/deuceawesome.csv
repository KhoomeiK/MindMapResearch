>As chief of police in Toronto, you were very strict about drugs. You put people in jail. There are young people who are in jail because of people like you. You don't see any contradiction between your past life as chief of police ...

>Not at all. What I did in law enforcement, I ascribed and I followed my oath of office, the laws of the land, my duty and responsibility, I did it faithfully and accountably.

>You're making a huge mistake if you believe that I put everyone in jail that I came across that had marijuana. I gave all kinds of people all kinds of breaks.

>So we're talking about a different issue. We're talking about me today, as a responsible, educated, informed citizen who's had the experience of knowing the benefits of medical cannabis for people who are suffering from ailments that are normally not well cared for by plying them with opiates.

Ive been in a pretty bad depression the last couple years and have tried just about every nootropic and legal thing money can buy. Kratom works for a bit until it doesn't, then it just becomes ""duhhh"" for me. Phenibut tolerance escalates to the point of insanity so you can't keep that going. Lyrica just makes me feel sort of drunk. So basically downers aren't the solution. I have concerta and all it does is make me calm as a cucumber, not get me going, which is what I need. Concerta feels like a benzo to me without the buzziness. My brain is weird.

I was previously on Wellbutrin and it worked fairly well until it pooped out. SSRI's are a part of the puzzle for me but only a small part. Which is why I like the non seratonin RC's, don't need seratonin syndrome in my medical file.

3fpm is the best thing I have ever found for my ailments. I know thats not necessarily a good thing but its brought me out of a two year funk. Hoping the aderall will have the same effect and I can put the 3fpm away only for special occasions.

I maintain a proper sleep and diet schedule and try to take the minimum amount to keep me going. It is fiendishly moorish though so some days I slip up, but there is a ceiling to its effects with me and redosing doesn't really do much so I can't see it becoming a ""problem"" like meth or coke would."

Ive never had it, the worst thing Ive felt from it was a ""duh"" mental hangover after pushing it one day.

For me personally, sleep is key. If I stay in my sleep routine I stay healthy, thats what I love about 3fpm. I can use it during the day and sleep normally at night, feeling nothing the next day.

Staying up all night wears your body down (ex raver AMA) and you are much more prone to illness and the various side effects of everything. Probably not your case.

Maybe you don't take well to it, or maybe you just got the flu dude.

>I redosed twice more that day in hopes of keeping the magic going (spoiler: it didnt rly work, i only got flat stimulation with no euphoria, bummer), totalling my intake to around 120-130mg for that day.

I don't find it good for euphoria at all. I do get a for sure mood boost and mundane tasks that wouldn't normally get done get done. Redosing keeps that going but by the end of they day I start to get the residual stimulation with no mental boost so I shut it down. Usually around 6pm. Then relax for a bit and go to bed at a normal time. Its strictly a functional thing for me and for many.

I haven't tried 96 RC's only a handful. My getting fucked up days are long behind me. I sometimes need an etizolam to kill anxiety/panic. I sometimes need 3FPM to get through work, not to stay up all night gaming.

Do I worry about what Im putting into me? A little. Not as much as those pressed E's I bought in my early 20's that were made from god knows who god knows where, with god knows what in them.

At least with the RC's the vendors are identifiable, there is info on the product, and they seem to be distributed with good hygiene in mind. I still always do allergy tests with every batch (more of a make sure its what it actually says test) and try not to overdue it.

Ive never actually purchased from Indiamart proper but have gotten a couple of orders from India from private vendors. Blisterpacks and consistency similar  to our own. I was surprised by that. Sun pharma seems to be pretty good.

Indiamart seems to have their own payment system but not for this particular company. Ive seen various MAOI's on indiamart but like you have been reluctant. Language barrier and the overall clunkiness of the interface have held me back.

This whole process with him has taken almost 6 months. See him every two weeks. Obsessed with blood pressure (its normal) I have been on various psych meds for 20 years, this isn't my first rodeo, I know exactly what to look for with side effects. Im not nearly where I need to be and don't feel like going through this whole calendar year process all over again. I can't do it.

My wife called I don't know how many places and they all said the same thing, you have to use the facility in your region. I had no idea this was a thing. When things didn't work out with my psych in Lindsay I figured I would just drive to Peterborough and find one there. Haha. Nope.

For me it depends on the severity of the depression. If its a mild case, exercise is going to put you on an even better track then you were prior.

If its a severe case, its only a tool in the toolbox not the ultimate fix. Same with anti depressants by the way. If you have severe depression you need a rather large toolbox to fight it."

Interesting way of looking at it, and I actually gave my own substance use a review based on that.

Phenibut won't bail me out of a ""bad day"" the way that benzo's will. It will, however, make a good day better. Is this recreational? I would say it is.

Ive always said that the people who are most against social programs would benefit the most from them. I know out of my ancedotal network that is the case.

""Why should my tax dollars.....""

Stop right there father in law. You are self employed, pay basically nothing in tax and get most of your sales tax back in refunds. You don't pay tax dollars. Let the people who actually pay taxes speak.

To me its just the hangers on of Reagonomics; the ones who haven't put two and two together that unfettered capitalism has destroyed the middle class that they were once a part of.

The gay marriage part? Oh I am well versed in that with how I was raised. Small town, bible thumper parents. Neither uneducated, but lived in a small bubble of like minded people. When the talk of gay rights came to fruitition in the 80's they honestly were horrified. They thought that if they gave them these equal rights that they would then be allowed to adopt children and would end up molesting them, because gays are slobbering pedophiles.There main concern was for the benefits of children, but it was misguided somehow, someway.

It wasn't until very recently that my dad saw the err in his ways, and that most pedophiles tend to be ""straight"" people in some kind of twisted closet, and being gay had very little to do with it. Adult man liking adult man doesn't mean liking boys by default. There was a great South Park about this.

I don't blame my parents at all. I blame our society, the media, religion, and the fact that they have changed their belief structure speaks to that. People can change, but I say lets blame the systems that caused the outdated views rather than the people who hold them.
