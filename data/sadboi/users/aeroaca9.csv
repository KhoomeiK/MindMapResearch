If you are everyone’s last pick in terms of friendships or dating, there has to be some reason. It could be the depression/suicidal ideation you’re going through, having nothing that distinguishes you as SO material, or maybe not having any ability to communicate your thoughts and feelings to others. If you don’t want to be the last pick, you have to work to fix the issues that make you the last pick.

If you are focused on how others leave you for each other, I’d say you take other people’s actions personally. That can’t be healthy.

If you want to change, you need to act. Seek therapy, or find ways to be better. But if you’d prefer to keep wallowing, and wishing for suicide, I understand, I’m in the same boat.

If a god asked me if death was a good action in itself, I would probably laugh. That an all powerful god would ask me such a ridiculous question. I would tell that god that I chose to end my life because I was constantly suffering emotionally, and occasionally physically. That the traumas and monotony of my life eventually caused me to not care for living. I killed myself because I was tired of existing. That I resented the kind of world that god created for me to live in. That ultimately, the amount of bad I’ve done in my life probably outweighed the good. So then I’d probably just wait for that god to send me to hell or whatever thing came after. It’s what I’d deserve. 

Death is not the smartest thing I can do. Death is the only thing I can do. Because all the things that are supposed to alleviate depression are ineffective. I’m not being courageous for speaking about these issues, I’m being self-absorbed and honest. I don’t believe seeking death in itself is a meaningful action. I think it’s rather pointless, like myself."
Stoicism,fkr2v6g,t1_fkmokt1,1584460765.0,"I stop those good habits because I always end up forgetting, losing interest, or becoming discouraged after never achieving any goals. I’ve tried “shaking it up” but there are only so many things you can do differently. I never come closer to achieving my goals because even after losing weight after a few months, I always regain the weight in a few days. I have an erratic eating pattern. Some days I eat nothing, but usually find myself overeating due to stress. Seeing therapists and nutritionists and trying to personally solve this eating disorder has proven ineffective for the past couple years. So I know my endeavor to lose weight is pointless. And to be honest, if I began physically deteriorating, it may help encourage me further to give up on life and kill myself, so at this point I welcome it.

You’re not wrong about the second paragraph, when I’m in the depression, hopeful hypotheticals are just wishful thinking. But because I want to die, I can’t give up on thinking of a way to separate myself completely from others.

Lastly, virtue in kind actions like giving to the poor, talking to the lonely, etc do alleviate THEIR suffering. But I am self absorbed. That’s why I even made the post, because I AM suffering. I feel like I’m in turmoil. My suffering can’t be compared to the real suffering of everyone else, but I feel it should matter enough to end that suffering. And as long as I’ve lived, there is no end to depression but eventual death. Having any measure of success doesn’t cure it. Medication and therapy don’t cure it. Putting on a happy face and volunteering doesn’t cure it. Sorry but I find no meaning I’m helping others, regardless of how much I feel forced to do it. I’m not looking for peace. I’m waiting for death, and trying to find a way to hasten it. Isolating, misanthropy, weight gain, and apathy seem like the quickest way to it, and so I oblige."

Having people that care, that would cause them suffering doesn't compel me to try and get out of the depression. I feel if I could push them away, and sever their connection to me emotionally, that it would no longer matter to them whether I live or die. I know my suffering is felt by hundreds of millions, but it doesn't matter. I wish we wouldn't have to question our desire to die. I wish we could just freely kill ourselves, without judgement or consequence.

And sorry, I didn't mean to make it seem like virtue would matter if it were more popular. I meant that if, in my case, pursuing virtue doesn't help alleviate my suffering, and doesn't help anyone else, then why pursue it? It doesn't make me or others around me feel better about anything. I wish the 4 cardinal virtues helped me, as they do you, and everyone else here. But they don't. Maybe I'm self-absorbed. Maybe I am too concerned with my own pain. I'm sorry, I only came looking for a reliable answer to this pain. Something that works. But when nothing does, when I only want to pursue death, why can't I? Why shouldn't I?

Listen to these terrible, awful thoughts... why should I be proud of myself? Orienting my life around trying to bring pride implies that my life was even worth saving in the first place. I don't feel alive. And yet I keep walking forward. I'm not looking to control external things outside of my control, I'm looking to end myself.

I arrived to police at my home, who asked to look through my phone history, which I had already anticipated and deleted prior to arriving. Still, protocol is protocol. So I was taken to the hospital, where I had to wait overnight for the psychiatrist to arrive in the morning. When she asked me about the circumstances of my hospitalization, I easily lied and was released.

If you’re severely depressed and suicidal over someone external that you’re unable to control, I don’t think it really makes zero sense to kill yourself. Life is long and people come and go.
