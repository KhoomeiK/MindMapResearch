If you cant sleep and have a busy day ahead and need some quick bootleg tips, eat plenty fruits, play some video games, surround yourself w laughter and people with good vibes. Also, a shower is THE BEST after a roll when you're coming down. The heat feels like its extracting all the toxins and bad side effects out of your body (or a warm bath). Get in some sun also! The sun is your best friend! Write a small note to yourself to let yourself know that everything will be okay after the comedown goes away and everything is ALREADY okay!"

MDMA,fjrvdb1,t1_fhmry03,1583590540.0,"Hey, I have a question. When I roll, I dont get bad comedowns. I ONLY get bad comedowns when I do too much. Other than that, on a normal roll, the only bad effect I get from a comedown is anxiety and I assume it's because I already have generalized anxiety disorder, so MDMA definitely intensifies it. I just breathe through it all and I have a bottle of melatonin for good sleep, and family to be around. But sometimes I roll one day, then the next week, I roll again and its the exact same feeling, same comedown (only intensified anxiety). I also get an afterglow. Im starting to think that the reason I dont have the depressing comedown is because I already have low levels of serotonin (diagnosed major depression disorder). Maybe it's just that MDMA truly works for me with my depression! I was wondering about your thoughts on this. I only know a few people who have afterglows the day after with no depressing side effects, and that's including myself."

SOME jobs wont have a person standing in the bathroom with you, so its easy to use someone elses pee. Get a small bottle with a tip that comes off/on. Let the person pee in it, and keep the bottle between your legs the ENTIRE way there so the temperature can be right. Drop your pee and move on. It should come out okay. I did this 2 weeks ago and passed and got the job, flying colors. 

Make sure the person isn't pregnant and doesn't take medication such as benzos or amphetamines."
