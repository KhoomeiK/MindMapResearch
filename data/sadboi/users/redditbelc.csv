I never worried much about the illegality of it to be honest but I'm also an \~ignorant young adult. Anyway, my doctor encouraged me to join my state's medical marijuana program. Most doctors would argue marijuana is the safest medication for anxiety. While I do have the medical card in my state, I mostly live and work in the neighboring state where it's technically illegal for me to smoke (but I do anyway because it's decriminalized and I have the card and I feel like a cop would be nice to me.. I'm also a young, white woman so I have that unfortunate but likely priority)

I've been smoking all day every day pretty much since quarantine and I'm doing great. Could I smoke less to save money? Probably. Do I think it affects my medication at all? No. Do I think it negatively affects my anxiety? 9/10 times, no, but honestly sometimes, yes. I've seen a few other comments about weed causing anxiety and it happens to me but 

tdlr; the benefits outweigh that occasional happenstance \[of weed-induced anxiety\]"

So, what worked for me?

Nutrition: I slowly started making better eating decisions by choosing healthier foods and trying to follow a 1200-1500 calorie diet but my main philosophy was CICO (calories in calories out). Although, I would never restrict intensely if I had a bad day. I did not follow a diet. Throughout the year of losing weight, there were definitely a lot of nights that consisted of pizza, brownies, and alcohol. I approached weight loss the same way I'm approaching maintaining my weight and that's just to try to find a balance. A huge part of that was entirely changing my relationship with food and my body. This is something that has gotten easier and easier but has certainly taken time. I no longer feel guilt after indulging in ""bad"" food. I just don't do it all the time. I think it's important to have a good understanding of macros, calories, AND ingredients: not just one of those. Shoutout to r/progresspics r/loseit r/CICO r/1200isplenty . These threads helped me through the good and bad days.

Fitness: I started out doing r/C25K and r/strongcurves . Following the completion of C25K, I did r/b210k . By this point, I'd lost the 60 pounds. I then continued to train for a r/halfmarathon and now a r/Marathon .  While running, I also did some lifting. The only other actual plan I've done is Sarah's Day Sweat It To Shred It and Sweat It Reload. I highly recommend those plans as well. The first plan is all stuff you can do from home. The second you can still do from home but require some equipment like dumbbells. 

I was also just recently on a podcast where I talked about my weight loss journey and gave a bunch of tips. Please feel free to message me for more info

I hope these tips help someone! I also want to emphasize I WAS NOT A RUNNER!!!!! I really believe in the C25K program. When I started, I was intimidated by a 5-minute run. You can do it!! Happy to answer any other questions."
C25K,fg09ooy,t1_fg066ct,1580403213.0,thanks so much!!
C25K,fg00msc,t1_ffzz4jo,1580397557.0,"I do hope someone answers but you can definitely build that up! If you go out on walks, just try to run once for those 15 seconds and then cool down. On the next walk, try to do that 15 seconds twice. And so on. You can do it!"

Clubs, sororities, residence life, etc. I worked for reslife and loved It and also will say that department is very LGBTQ positive. I also lived my first year on the honors college floor. If you care about academics, I’d recommend applying to the honors college. MSU is definitely what you make of It. I think you can have a great experience, just put yourself out there.
Also, montclair was my safety school too. I moved on and got my masters from a more ‘prestigious’ institution. If that’s in your future, I think it’s more important to save money undergrad. Hope this helps."

The girls are BACK after a long week off  which means LONG LIFE UPDATE!! The girls share what they did over the  holidays. Fun stories because they were together through most of it.  Some highlights include Carlys dad worked out with her, Brooke got  dropped off in the wrong place after a night out in NYC, they spent New  Years running rampant through Vermont skiing and using massage guns, you  know, the usual. But now they’re getting back into their marathon  training and want to give you some tips and encouragement if you’re  getting back into your meal prep routine or if you’re totally new to the  meal prep life and want to know some lazy girl tips to help it feel a  little less overwhelming!

Then we talk through some resolutions for 2020   and wrap it up by sharing our favorite things about the holidays. To   everyone who has given this podcast a listen so far this year, thank you   so much. It means the world to us! Here’s to a new year of loving   ourselves :-)

In  this ep, the girls share what began to  hold them back from diving into  this podcast head on. Maybe it wasn't  fully obvious but while we  posted our first few eps in November, they  were really recorded in  July. Things had fallen apart for Carly and  Brooke individually. Hear  more in the ep about their own battles with  anxiety and depression.  While that becomes the main focus of the  episode, we did share some  happier moments from Jonas Brothers tickets  to vacations. The girls  also share some advice on how to stay fit on  vacation and ideas for how  to workout/diet while traveling!

 Carly and Brooke give a bunch of tips of what to do when you’re first starting out out in the gym or the health kitchen. Episodes  going forward will dive deeper into fitness topics, but this ep is a  great place to start if you’re a total newbie. The girls talk through  identifying goals, how to design a workout plan tailored to those goals,  where to find cool workouts, and generally how and what to eat! You’ll  also hear some words of encouragement because we all know how hard it  can be to build up the confidence to get to the free weight side of the  gym with all the WORKOUT BROS!! If you’re a workout virgin, this is a  great place to start :)

sex,f2bov2r,t3_dcmrhg,1570129126.0,"So, I have genital HSV-1 which is pretty rare. HSV-1 is commonly referred to as oral herpes and HSV-2 as genital herpes, however, you can get either strain on your mouth or genitals. While I always support condoms.. I want to also say that I would have sex with someone without a condom and without disclosing herpes. 

The reason for that is many people, primarily those with my strain of herpes, don't get any other outbreaks in their life besides the initial outbreak. I even have a friend who has genital HSV-2 and her outbreaks have lessened and lessened in frequency and severity over the years. It is extremely rare to pass on herpes, especially from female to male, when you are not having an outbreak. You can google this. I'm too lazy to at the moment, but I did plenty of research when I was first diagnosed. 

For this reason, I don't always feel the need to disclose it and my doctor has encouraged me to make that decision for myself. I don't know if I will ever have an outbreak again. While I always could, I don't think the conversation is necessary 100% of the time I have sex with a new partner unless I am having an outbreak. There is always a chance you can be shedding, but hey 25% of the world has oral herpes and you're not asking for their STD results before you make out.

Herpes has a horrible stereotype and it won't likely won't affect me anymore than mono or the chicken pox."

The first month I could not orgasm and was just generally a bit more disinterested in sex than usual.

The past two weeks have been better. I've tried masturbating more than usual because there's less pressure than with a partner and knowing that I COULD orgasm was really helpful for my mental state. Over the past few weeks, I've been able to orgasm. Not every time, but it has definitely improved. Granted, it takes a bit longer to get things going but it's getting easier.

I am hoping that staying optimistic and continuing to try both solo and with a partner will eventually make it even easier. 

I hope you don't give up yet!"
