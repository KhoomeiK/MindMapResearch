Let me put it to you this way, energy is energy. It isn't dark or light, it isn't sexual or violent, it isn't anything other than what it naturally is. Energy.

If you can figure out how to raise raw energy and let the spirit do with it as the spirit will, then you have a leg up on a lot of occultists.

All of this talk about masturbation and orgasming on to the seals is fine and good, but it seems like it would be quiet limiting. You're relying on a base bodily desire in order to generate the energy that you're trying to give to Mama Lilith.

Draw the sigil, light a candle behind it, and gaze into it for 15 minutes while meditating. You'll create a deeper connection with Mama Lilith that way than you will by jerking off on to her sigil. 

Besides, the first time you come in contact with a girl that you really want to get to know, is your first reaction to jerk off onto her?

As far as there being something wrong with me, that is debatable, I don't Flinch at the idea of putting a child molester through a meat grinder.

A thief can be rehabilitated, or made to pay for the items that he stole. A car thief can be retrained to utilize his knowledge in order to fix people's cars instead of stealing them. A burglar can turn his expertise at breaking into houses in order to be a security consultant. A murderer, and this is my opinion only, can be utilized as a shock troop to demoralize and Destroy enemy forces. But a rapist or a child molester has no redeeming qualities. None.

Once a murderer has killed his or her victim, victim suffering is over. That victim will never have a problem ever again for the rest of their life because their life is over. They don't have nightmares, trust issues, they don't have to sleep with a shotgun next to their bed, they don't have to fear intimacy with a future partner, they're dead.

A rape victim has nightmares, needs therapy to get over everything that happened, and usually has severe problems with Intimacy in the future. Rape and child molestation victims are irrevocably harmed. I'm not saying they can't come to terms with their trauma, I'm saying that these monsters should have no recourse other than to understand that if they touch a child in a sexual way, that the next step is immediate execution.

The threads were always white, as well as the toilet bowl, meaning that you had to take one of the pencil from the inmates property and run it around the inside of the rim of the toilet in order to find the thread.

I found drugs, SIM cards, cell phones, Chargers, cigarettes, notes, and all other interesting manner of Contraband that way.

Although, now that I think about it, if I have a full 30 minutes before they're going to show up and raid my house, and I need to hide a single USB stick, I'm leaving. I'm going to go for a jog, go for a drive, I'm simply going to go somewhere else and find a much better place to hide it before I go back to the house and watch the FBI agents lose their shit."

The games that I play are pretty data-intensive, and they run perfectly without any issues almost always, unless there's something going on, but that's pretty rare.

I tried looking it up, and the only thing people are telling me is that it is the new band , well what's the advantage?."

AskReddit,fiwp4ni,t3_fa8exn,1582796148.0,"Tried to save a life. Witnessed a really bad car wreck. I was the first one on the scene, and I tried to keep this kid alive while we were waiting on the ambulance.

Kid didn't make it, but the fact that I was wanting to crawl into a car that smelled like gasoline apparently made people think that I was brave. I do have some first responder training, but, due to the exclusivity of this kid's injuries, trying to do CPR would have just cause more damage. Without getting into too many details, let's just say that the kid had severe chest trauma.

The kid that was driving the car survived despite being launched through the windshield , the kid that died was his brother.

I don't remember much for the next few days."
