You don't see how messy my house is because I can't be bothered cleaning during the week and just do like a quick pick up and that's it. You don't see me falling asleep on the bus to my 9-5 or sometimes even coming back from it. You don't see all the unfinished projects, half watched movies waiting for me to have time to finish them. It's tiring, and often you reach a point where you have to say ""thats it, I need a day of doing fuck all to recuperate"". The thing that keeps me going is wanting it. I want my business to succeed so I can have the future I want. And I get stuck in a catch 22 where I need the 9-5 for money, but I don't have enough time to put into the business to make enough money from that to quit the 9-5. I know that in order to make that last push I'm going to have to sacrifice even more and to be honest I'm holding back because I'm already exhausted. But I want to do it this year. It's going to be hard, but worth it. When I'm feeling low on motivation I listen to what I call ""shouty black men"" on youtube. It's motivational speeches, often aimed at athletes.
