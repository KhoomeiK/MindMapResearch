playstation,flkq9xm,t3_fp2thw,1585245665.0,I still have mine but the color display is not working 100%. I have to bend the body to correct it.
HalfLife,fljzi2z,t3_fp2017,1585230599.0,"After waiting so long for the sequel and just finishing the game last night, it feels like I myself was trapped in stasis by the Gman and just now coming back to the world. When Eli gave you that crowbar, I truly felt like I was Gordon. I would be lying if I said I wasn't emotional about it, or even cried.

This whole time while playing Alyx, in the back of my mind I wondered why there wasn't any type of melee combat when we know full well VR is more than capable. Maybe it was just technical reasons that I have no way of knowing or that it didn't fit with Alyx as a character. But I feel like Valve did this intentionally because they wanted us to experience that moment of picking up that crowbar as Gordon again for the first time in a new generation of gaming.

I don't see Half-Life 3 not being VR. Too much work has been done to let the Index go by the way side and just go back to being a pancake game. Even just seeing the HEV gloves in VR was such a powerful moment for me, it's like revisiting an old friend I've never seen in a long time. Half-Life I feel wasn't about the story or the gameplay. I feel like the series as a whole was used as a way for Valve to push the gaming industry forward to new heights and standards and pave the way to the future of digital entertainment. Look back at Half-Life 2 and how Source created a trend of physics based gameplay that the industry followed. Look how even Half-Life 1 set the FPS standard in both gameplay and visual story telling.

I probably sound like the an idiot right now, but these are just thoughts I've had ever since the announcement of HL:A and was just speculating what it all meant moving forward."

boneworks,fahpdcd,t1_fahovra,1576090667.0,"So yes, what I've heard is the lead dev of Boneworks, Brandon, got to play HL:A very early and gave feedback to Valve. I think he had some ideas to improve the game and in response made his own game to showcase. After showing it to them, they were impressed with how the game turned out and decided to adapt some of the features into HL:A and allow Stress Level Zero to sell their own game on Steam. It just couldn't be a Half-Life game.
