Well the couple that we’re hosting were both in the air force and the wife was pregnant, the husband pulled me aside and asked if I had any music. I drove so I went to my car to get some cds (2004), came back had him pick a few. The husband would not leave me alone kept asking me to do things, I figured me and his wife were the only sober ones so I kept helping, things like making drinks helping them set up beer pong or other games, nothing weird. We had been there maybe two hours when my date grabbed me by the elbow and asked me to drive him back to his place to get more beer. Well as we were driving back he started bitching about what an asshole the husband was and he just needed an excuse to get me out of there, I was so confused. It turns out that the husband was telling people that he was going to nail me that night, that I was doing favors for him to try and get everyone else drunk so we could be alone. 

Long story short, as soon as my date and I left one of the friends I had originally taken there confronted the husband and they got into a huge brawl. The cops were called and both ended up getting kicked out. Looking back I know my date was looking out for himself as much as me. I have no idea what happened to the wife but she was super sweet so I hope she got away from the creeper."
