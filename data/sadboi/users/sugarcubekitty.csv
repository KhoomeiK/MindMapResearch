BPD,fjeu4d6,t3_fcrfpo,1583278261.0,"Yessss omfg. I had an ex friend that would say hurtful things to me and my bf literally said ""babe.. Don't you think you're being dramatic?"" no!"
BPD,fi2z0yy,t3_f5v7vg,1582093895.0,I deal with this as well! Its incredibly frustrating and kinda hard to explain to others.
beauty,fi2t5mb,t3_f5yshl,1582088357.0,I use it kinda like a deep conditioning treatmeant for my lashes. Whenever I feel like they need some extra love. My mascara goes on amazingly the next day!
Hair,fhypbbf,t3_f5hg7a,1581980757.0,"9 months ago I had a ""I need to change every thing"" moment and bleached my virgin hair twice.  It turned out super ugly (but not destroyed since I waited about two weeks to bleach it again. thank god) so I decided to put a red (as filler) then a brown dye over it. It turned to be a gorgeous red that I managed to keep for a while. Now its faded asf and I need a change. I was wanting to go back to my natural color with some balayage. 
How can I fade this red even more before I go to a salon? Or should I put a brown dye (not a box dye) over it and just wait a month or two before getting a balayage? 
Please help my hair is bringing down my self esteem so bad ugh!"

HomeDecorating,fcaulnt,t3_eggc5m,1577576920.0,A shelf would be cute. Could probably put more stuff on it too.
HomeDecorating,fcatxwv,t3_egy653,1577576550.0,"The blankets on the floor 'cause I was trying to see if I liked the look of a rug. Lol 
so far the giant teddy bear and bike are gonna be moved. I plan on painting the coffee table and side table white, getting a beige or grey couch cover (had the couch for over a year still love it but want something new) and cute decor pillows. As far as everything else (walls,rug etc.) idk what to do. I want to go for a glam, chic, ""she probably got money but she really don't"" kinda vibe"

Thank you for your input. (thats not meant to sound bitchy. Lol)"
relationship_advice,fc8bg66,t1_fc8aq0o,1577531141.0,I thought about telling him that but I'm not sure how well that would go over.. He sometimes gets in these weird moods after I tell him something (like when I confessed) where he'll just ignore me.
sugarlifestyleforum,epj2f9h,t1_epiw2o2,1559246097.0,Please read the post again. thank you.
sugarlifestyleforum,epivlxm,t1_epitdqe,1559243722.0,Did you have any feelings for her or was it just the fact that you guys worked together that freaked you out?
