Edmonton,fpeto4k,t1_fpeipx6,1588554699.0,"Again, where are the illegally obtained firearms coming from? I am not saying that law-abiding citizens and licensed firearm owners are the ones killing people. I repeat, I am not accusing you or any other law abiding citizen of shooting someone. Here is some more information because apparently you're still not listening:

""Guns stolen in break and enters

While legal gun owners are being charged less frequently with unsafe storage of a firearm, the number of gun-theft charges has grown.

But the specific offence of ""breaking and entering to steal firearm"" was only added to the Criminal Code of Canada in 2008 and Statistics Canada only began tracking charges under this law in 2009.

As you can see, the rate of these crimes has more than tripled since then, but some degree of ramping up is to be expected, as police services across the country adapt to a new law. And the number of gun thefts edged downward in 2017, with 1,175 incidents last year."" Published by CBC (Source: Stats Canada)

""The 1991 Angus Reid survey asked respondents to indicate how many firearms household members owned. The data suggested that 60 percent of Canadian households with firearms have one or two; 13 percent own three; 14 percent own five; and 10 percent own seven or more firearms. On average, firearm owners possess approximately 2.7 firearms (Angus Reid, 1991:6). Few other surveys have included such a question.""

""About 25 percent of Canadian households own some sort of firearm (Gabor, 1994: 9). A recent Department of Justice Canada report indicated that, based on the combined findings of several studies, 26 percent may be the most reliable figure (See Block, 1998:3). In total, it is estimated that about 3 million civilians in Canada own firearms. (Department of Justice)

First off, there is your number of how many civilians own firearms (3 million if you didn't want to read the facts above). let's say your significant other and your close friends (average number of close friends is 3) support you. 3 millon x 5 = 15 million people that support guns in general (this is assuming your friends do not also own a gun. If they do, it means I am counting them twice - if this doesn't make sense to you, this figure is in favor of guns in general). That's only 40% of Canadians that are supportive of owning guns in general - which means that is a minority, and not a majority.

Second, let's be really modest and say all thefts of firearms are from households with only one firearm. That is 1,175 guns circulating illegally per year that were originally obtained legally. The likelihood of a gun owner purchasing another gun after the previous gun was stolen is very high, but let's say some don't. Change the number as you wish, but I will arbitrarily say about 900 guns are stolen per yer (which is likely low). Depending on how many years you want to look at it, or how many guns you want to assume one criminal is buying off the market, they have an extensive selection in the black market. Removing 1,500 types of firearms (and don't let me get into how many types of firearms exist because the list is super long), means that there will likely be less legally obtained guns per civilian, resulting in less guns being stolen, resulting in less guns circulating illegally in the black market.

Again, all the numbers I chose are in favor of your argument. There are a lot of illegally obtained firearms in our country. Some do come in from the U.S., but a lot come from within our country thanks to the works of our border control.

Third, there are a ton of laws implemented for traffic. Just refer to the laws implemented after the Humbolt tragedy. It doesn't matter how many deaths happen per capita, in my opinion. If you are just looking a the person dying, it is a low percentage. If you look at how many people are affected, that percent grows much, much larger. Also, in my opinion losing any life that had a chance of being prevented is too much. If it was something that we had the possibility as a society to control, then let's try to do something about it. Complaining that you're going to not be able to have what you want, or that the government is going to buy your now illegal weapon for a lower price than what you paid it for is childish.

In regards to your fear that all firearms will banned one day, I can guarantee, 100%, that some firearms will always be legal in Canada, just not all types of firearms. You will still have the liberty to use firearms, so stop whining."
Edmonton,fpdrx13,t1_fpdq8wg,1588532999.0,"I'm sorry, but I can't give you sympathy for life being unfair to you. Some people have lost their families and can't even enjoy a simple beer with them, and you're complaining you can't enjoy shooting 1,500 types of guns with your family? If you look at polls and stats, the majority of Canadians were asking for this ban. To point your finger at a government saying that their doing it for selfish purposes, then also point your finger at me and several other Canadians who don't have the luxury of shooting guns for pleasure with their family members. Life is unfair, and you are now experiencing it. I'm jealous that your life has been so rewarding to this point, compare to mine and those that don't have a family anymore to even spend a split second with. And if you look at the stats of other countries, yes, firearm bans does reduce the occurrences of gun-related harm. Come up with a solution that works in reducing gun-related violence, and then maybe your arguments will make more sense. To simply say that, ""The government is doing it for selfish reason so this ban is bad,"" is absolutely garbage. There are also several alternatives to enjoying time with your family. Find those alternatives, and get used to them. Sorry, not sorry, but welcome to the reality of unfairness?"
Edmonton,fpdnr58,t1_fpcg4ym,1588530630.0,"So then my question is why are you complaining if you can still have a gun that is the same as one that they are banning? Also, are you saying that a pointy stick can kill as many people as an ar15 in, let's say, one minute? No. I don't get why you're so upset about this ban. It's gonna cost you money in the end to get rid of this gun, but it costed some families their loved ones. Sorry, I guess your money and your problems are much more important. The thing is, it's a deterrent! Yes, there are other people out there who have the know how to access these now illegal firearms, but there are also people who don't, but still may have the desire to gain access to firearms with ill-intentions. Be it that is reduces the chance of a mass shooting by a random individual by 1%, that's still better than 0% with you not having to pay out of your pocket. Sorry, I consider someone else's life more valuable than your money."
Edmonton,fpc7hzp,t1_fp6hx9x,1588490226.0,"It's interesting how you target Trudeau and the Liberals. There are articles (several linked in this thread already) that the majority of Canadians want to ban more firearms. If the Green Party, or NDP, or Conservative government did the same thing, and banned more guns after a mass shooting, would you still put a comment up condemning the government? I feel like you wouldn't..."
Edmonton,fpc728h,t1_fp6ik6s,1588489793.0,"You still have the liberty to guns and safety. There is simply less choice for what guns you can get. If you can't defend yourself with the guns available, the other guns won't necessarily help you anymore... They are not banning all guns..."

Edmonton,fpc6l7w,t1_fpc5o8d,1588489319.0,"Because those guns that are more efficient at killing people would not have been in that house in the first place.

Let's put this into another context. There are laws that prohibit speeding, and there are laws that condemn those that have killed an individual in a car accident. The reason that there are laws prohibiting speeding is to reduce the amount of damage that would occur in a car accident. Two laws. Not redundant. Both can help reduce the number of deaths by deterring people from speeding, and from accidents that cause death which is higher in accidents that involve speeding.

Laws are put into place to condemn those that steal, or murder. A second law removing tools that increase the chance of a thief or murderer harming more people. Two laws. Not redundant. Targeting two different aspects of criminal activity to reduce the chance of increase fatality and harm in a possible situation."
Edmonton,fpc67g6,t1_fpc2thy,1588488953.0,"Exactly, so my argument is valid. You can't say, without a doubt, that this law would not have prevented an individual from getting a gun to cause a mass shooting. I get it, you're fully against this law, but in the end, you can't deny that this law has a chance of deterring some individuals from obtaining weapons that are more efficient at killing people."

Several illegally obtained firearms were once legally obtained and stored in homes. These guns are still circulating. If these guns were restricted prior to them being stolen, then guns that would be less efficient at killing people would be circulating instead of higher powered firearms. Go ahead, downvote me all you want."
