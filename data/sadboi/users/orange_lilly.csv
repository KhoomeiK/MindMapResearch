HairDye,fqb4bzt,t3_ghvw7o,1589230352.0,"This [neon peach](https://limecrime.com/products/neon-peach-hair-color) would look cute with your skin tone. It takes to the medium blonde to look more muted and then your more lighted strands will be super bright and pop. It'd look good with out having to put any bleach on. A lot of people are doing pink right now (it's a personal fave of my mine as well) and I think this is just a nice variation of that since it's a warm pastel. 

I also really like the whole idea of monochromatic looks right now and I think a blue would look nice to match your eyes. I like [this](https://limecrime.com/products/neon-peach-hair-color) one. Would add a lot of conditioner to the hair dye it to achieve a lighter shade, though."

Not sure what the natural tone of red your hair is but assuming it's the stereotypical ginger red, I suggest looking into coppers and other orangish tones. If you already knew that, though, and are asking if you'll get that color from mixing the auburn and hot red together, I'm gonna wager no."
HairDye,fq14ubk,t3_gghttz,1589041761.0,"I've done blue multiple times and I'm sorry to tell you that I've had to chop/grow out my hair every time. 

My sister is a cosmetologist and I'm chill about my hair so I let her test on me from time to time. The most recent fantasy colors I did were magenta and sky blue by ion. It was split dyed down a middle part and a full fringe. Eventually put sky blue over the magenta as well to make purple. Did all that without my sister. Then I had unforeseen circumstances that required me having a natural hair color. So I got her and I tried to go back to platinum. Used 40 developer as we normally did with my hair. Did as many sessions as my hair could take and it was still a blue tone. So we resorted to covering it all with chocolate brown because of the time crunch. There were still obvious tones of green and purple. Ended up trying to chop off the ends because they were the worst part. In the end I had a pixie cut. Then I tried to go to my favorite hairstylist for a second opinion because my hair was still a nasty blue/green/brown. Like a bruise. She tried to bleach some highlights into it a bit and it was no better looking. Ended up just leaving it tf alone and it grew out. Had a lot of good laughs along the way, though I'm not too sure I'll do it again anytime soon lol

Tl;dr I tried everything under the sun and ended up having to just chop and grow it after a blue dye all over my head. I can't guarantee how your hair will react, but that was my expierence and I hope you might be able to take something from it.

Edit: Felt the need to add that I also have naturally light brown/dark blonde hair. I started out with a rooted platinum look before the fantasy colors, though."
HairDye,fq0yhsz,t3_gg25aj,1589039209.0,"If you want to do other colors, then do them before the black. If you put an artificial black on your hair, it will be difficult to lift off with bleach afterwards. It's possible to bleach black out but it takes multiple treatment and sometimes the undertone of the black will come out like with the issues you mentioned with it turning red. It's also easy to fry your hair off when you do this. Also, if you want to do other colors, bleaching your virgin hair and then toning it will result in a more even base to put your fun colors on than if you were to try and pull the black off. Anyway, your best course of action is to bleach it, do fun colors, and then when you're done, cover it all with black if you really must. Also, I know this wasn't an answer to the question asked, but it's my suggestion as I have never heard of a black dye just fading out enough to anything fun with it afterwards."
HairDye,fq0vvxk,t3_gg6yyu,1589038299.0,"I have before. Its going to require a ton of bleach. I personally have to use 40 developer but your hair may be finer and would be better off using a lower developer. You're not going to want any brassiness or orange from the bleach if you want bubblegum. So, you'll definitely need a toner. If you don't get it platinum then it'll be closer to a coral. Also, the molecules of warmer tones tend to fall out of the hair cuticle because their molecules are larger than other tones. After you bleach hair, it becomes more porous and will hold color well at the beginning but will quickly drop the larger, warm toned molecules. It'll require a lot of up keep to maintain a certain tone and even then, you'll have a new shade of hair after every wash. I suggest watching hairstylist videos and getting tips from them. READ THE INGREDIENTS of the stuff that you like and compare it to the ingredients suggested by professionals."

I am also extremely into the 60's and 70's for decor and I have had a lot of luck at these places, especially flea markets and yard sales. You'll want to know how to haggle if you're dealing directly with people, though. Another tip that may be obvious to some but not all is that on Sunday, Goodwill has a 99¢ day. There's a designated tag color of the week that is 50% off every day except Sunday, when it's only 99¢. If there's something you like and it's Saturday, just come back in the morning and it'll be 99¢. They don't hold stuff, though.

I'm not suggesting click bait but possibly get a good logo made up (try r/slavelabour for something within budget at first) or try some editing skills to catch peoples eye.

E: spelling"
Advice,fjgdb2h,t1_fjgd43d,1583322812.0,"I advise just ignoring his posts as he is obviously a troll or at the very least, unhelpful from ignorance. If it's something that you feel is worth reporting then do so. He isnt offering advice so I'm sure the mods will agree."
Advice,fjgd1wz,t3_fdbqce,1583322531.0,"If someone lied about their job at the bar and you slept with them from being impressed, would it be rape? Nope. If you consented, and from the info in the post it sounds like you did, then you just made a poor decision based on a lie you were fed. If someone lies and that leads to you sleep with them then that was your decision. Situation sucks as you were manipulated but my only advice is to cut him out. He sounds like a toxic and scummy human being. If you feel it's your place to talk to his gf (I don't know how well you know her), then you might. Personally, though, if that part isn't your direct issue then I advise leaving her to her own devices unless she asks you directly."
Advice,fjgcptw,t1_fjgcn0j,1583322155.0,Did you even read the post?
Advice,fjgccnm,t3_fdacus,1583321738.0,"I am unsure if all these comments are guys daydreaming but I don't advise his putting your mouth straight to his genitals if he's not awake to consent. Especially since you haven't had a long sexual relationship with him. Just stroke his arm really lightly and it should stir him, then when he's more aware of what's going on, try to step it up and see how he responds. This post is a bit old so I wouldn't be surprised if I missed the window of help. Either way, for future reference, here's my piece! Good luck.

Advice,fjgbo5o,t3_fdamyv,1583320921.0,"Get on indeed! Seriously, you just go through and fill out a bunch of stuff about yourself and expierence. Then when you go to download it, it gives you template options so you can display it how you'd like. They also offer assessments you can take that employers can refer to.

E: Sorry, I forgot to mention. I know you think you have little to put down but you'd be surprised. The questions they ask on Indeed are pretty expansive to cover volunteering and whatnot!"
Advice,fjgbb23,t1_fjg9t88,1583320462.0,"I know you aren't posting to seek job hunting advice but I have expierence with shit work situations and thought I might be able to help with the transition. Just spam indeed and don't have too high of standards. I know that sounds God awful but just hear me out. Just avoid jobs you can't survive on or that are way out of your comfort zone. (For example, I refuse to do fast food anymore) I suggest a delivery driving job as it is surprisingly good tip money, and then while you've got a steady cash flow, you can actually look for a job more suited for you. It's always easier to find a job when you've got a job."
Advice,fjgb0es,t3_fdb1ou,1583320081.0,"Not sure about after this, but I advise not encouraging him to go after her if you're interested. It'll cause trouble if you go after her and then he's just off to the side ""tf bro?"" He's going to think you just did him dirty. If he's you're legit friend, then you should respect him by telling him the truth while being thoughtful of how he feels."
Hair,fjga7d5,t1_fjf4vdw,1583319026.0,Pink is always a cute fall back if you turn out a little brassy. Learned this after freaking out over a bad salon visit lol I was mortified by my cheese-hair so I covered it up with pink and it came out cute and kinda peachy
Advice,fjerayd,t3_fd37p6,1583276792.0,Way too vague.
InsectPorn,fjejw3c,t1_fjeg7ui,1583273086.0,"Like I said, old wives tale!"
InsectPorn,fjef76f,t1_fjef23r,1583270793.0,Well I don't know the validity of this but I've always heard it originated at flutterby then at point was recorded incorrectly to butterfly. So this may just be an old wives tale but ya might be interested in googling more!
InsectPorn,fjedmmw,t1_fje1inq,1583269935.0,Just another term for butterfly.
