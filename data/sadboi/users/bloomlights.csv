One of the items was a empty cardboard box, and it was passed around the circle as such items like footballs, hats, boxing gloves.. etc etc. But when it got to this one boy, he opened the box, looked inside and said ‘this isn’t a cardboard box, it’s my will to live’ and passed it onto the next person with no facial expression whatsoever. 

He didn’t mean it (hopefully) and laughed afterward, but it sure did result in an awkward silence for a few seconds."

Anger,ewizum0,t1_ewiyxry,1565459282.0,"Well my parents divorced when i was 5 years old, though my mom would also get angry at me for no reason too, or at the little things - perhaps mirroring my dad’s actions toward my mom, though i’m not too sure. 

I do get angry at my mom aswell, but i see her quite rarely and am around my dad more often (every day), thus explaining the regular anger towards my dad and not so much my mom."
depression,ew4lorx,t3_cmmstv,1565113278.0,"i remember putting the biggest smile on for my therapist on the second week i visited her, i was in so much pain but i didn’t want therapy and was trying to convince her i was fine. (this was back in school, i was forced to go to therapy)

she asked me what was up
‘nothing, i feel great today’ 
‘no, i can see it in your eyes, tell me - what’s wrong?’

that broke me, my smile immediately ceased and i burst into tears, man - i was holding so much shit inside of me, and i still think about that therapy session  very often, do my eyes really give away so much?"
