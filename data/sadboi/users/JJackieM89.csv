eating_disorders,fn51m68,t3_fz3hvb,1586653779.0,Simply asking this question is an indication that you have an ED. Most of us who have one never feel “sick enough” to get help. You don’t have to have symptoms for years in order to have an ED. Don’t wait until you hit rock bottom to get help! I was hospitalized only three months after mine started. Time really doesn’t matter here.

The thing is, I WAS going through mood changes during my therapy sessions, and I did feel like exploding with anger, but I knew it wasn't appropriate. Everything that I feel happens inside of me, and I rarely display my strong emotions"

I never really got to be a teenager and live a happy, care-free life. I'm thirty years old now and still have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing or even what I want to do. I feel stuck, like I'm wandering around with no sense of direction. I'm scared for my future and where I will end up. And yes, my mind feels stuck at 15. It's good to know that we are not alone in what we are feeling. Keep your head up and keep pushing on. Do you have a therapist? Mine helps me a lot, and I'm starting DBT next week.

Trust me on this, you don't want to be suffering, like I am, when you're older. Your mom is your mom - she's supposed to help you! I'm sure she would be behind you 100% if you told her what's going on, and proud of you for wanting to get better.
