AskMen,fprm5gc,t3_gf3170,1588857426.0,"I was raised in a catholic household, would go to church every sunday, would go to a religious education class wednesday nights, and I went through confirmation. I stopped believing in a god sophomore year of highschool, I was bullied a lot and was dealing with major depression and anxiety. It got to a point where I grew angry if there was a god how could he let me and others suffer and for what? Why am I expected to live with mental illness while others dont have to deal with it because ""god made me that way"" and I spend the rest of eternity in hell if I kill myself? The final straw for me was when I tried to kill myself senior year of highschool and my dad said ""why is he in a hospital right now he doesnt need a doctor he needs a priest"" after I had taken 2 and a half bottles of anti-depressants that caused me to have 2 seizures and hallucinate for 4 days straight. No longer believing in a god actually helped me deal with my depression, I couldnt just blame some shitty god anymore and started to work on myself and get help."

She helped me through a really rough time and we became really close ever since. After a while I began to realize that I cared about her a lot and that I want to be more than just friends with her.

She has been there for me in some dark times and I do care about her immensely and that's why I came for advice the last thing i want to do is ruin our friendship."

AskMen,fotxmrk,t3_g94awg,1588069770.0,"This girl I've been friends with for 4 years, originally when we met I was dating my ex but she liked to be up late and I'm a night person who was working nights at the time so I would go and chill with her after work. For a while I felt super awkward with her, I was moving, and I was going through a major depressive period so we grew distant but she would hit me up still even tho I was isolating. I moved back last year and we started seeing each other a lot, she was dating someone at the time but we would hang out all the time and it didnt feel awkward anymore so I spent more time with her and we've grown very close and recently she split with her last boyfriend. Currently I'm focused on helping her through the breakup but in a month or 2 I think I am going to ask her out. She stuck with me through some dark times and is a great friend to me and I really care about her a lot. We also have a mutual friend who has been trying to set us up for quite some time now."

depression,fljor6e,t3_fp9fqc,1585221496.0,"I thought the same way a lot when I was younger, I would get home and lock my self in my room and play video games, my parents always blamed my bad grades on that when in reality it was just me do anything i could to distract myself, it got to the point where when I was 16 I tried to overdose and very nearly died but once I recovered I just kept thinking when I get older and have more control over my life things will be better and at 21 (22 in a week) I can honestly say my life has improved significantly, I still get depressed and with the outbreak there are a lot of concerns that I may lose my job but overall my life did get a lot better and now there are times when I am actually happy. 

Dont give up and things will get better, they will never be perfect but it's worth living even if it doesnt seem that way sometimes now."

Other airlines have already started laying off their employees and I have been lucky in that mine hasn't, they have treated me very well and havent cut my hours yet, I know in other industries people have been laid off and need the money so give the monthly money to those people, I dont need any money from the government if I can keep my job, only give bailouts to the companies still paying employees and only give monthly money to the people whose income has been effected by the outbreak"

leagueoflegends,eue34rf,t1_eudymcs,1563734105.0,I guess my point is what about them is random? Everyone has to play promos. Everyone knows they are there unless they are new to the game. And everyone knows that if you win 2 out 3 or 3 out of 5 you get promoted. The reasoning for them existing may seem arbitrary but so do many of the things any game designer does because we lack the insight into the development and all that stuff that the game designers see and do.
leagueoflegends,eue2h7h,t1_eudymcs,1563733625.0,But if you treat a promo the same as a normal ranked game you get closer or farther from ranking up based on whether you win or lose.  What about that is arbitrary? You still have to win to rank up or you lose and get farther from ranking up it's not based on any other factor
