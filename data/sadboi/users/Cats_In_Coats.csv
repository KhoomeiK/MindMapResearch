She was the one who let me know I’m a bit gay. And then *years* later, I moved and had grown close to another girl. We’d have sleepovers several times a week and we spend a crazy amount of time together. Then she got a boyfriend and moved away. 

The amount of anger and heartbreak I got from that was insane. That’s when I realized I’d had a crush on her the whole time and we pretty much were in a relationship excluding the sexual intimacy. Like...we’d spoon and hold hands and kiss each other’s cheeks. 

I’ve also had other crushes on girls throughout high school and got to watch them all get together with my other friends. I even found out that two of them almost asked me out, but thought I’d say no because they thought I was straight.

I will literally never learn.

I don’t know how old your friend is, or the specifics in his relationships with his family, but when I went away for college, the distance also helped.

I live with my aunt and uncle, and it took a few years for them to understand and accept me. So time was a factor. But things improved. Even to the point that when my little brother came out to us as Pan as well, things went smoother than it had when I did it.

I will say that the choice to do a third person of Molly was a really good choice. Since she’s the matriarchy of the family, that gave a good perspective on all the branches that started from her.
The characters were well written to the point that I could hear their voices as I read the lines. That’s something a lot of writers struggle with when using well known characters.
There was pretty consistent flow. What I mean is that as a reader, I didn’t get bored or tripped up in the background information.
The only suggestion for the flow, and I know this is a grammar thing but bare with me, is to read through it out loud and feel where the natural pauses are. Often than not, those are good places to put commas and will help the readers internal voice as they read it.
Another praise I have is how you started with Molly getting out of bed, and then ended with her going to bed. That really helped the story begin and close smoothly.

This story gave me a few chuckles, and many smiles. 

I thoroughly enjoyed it."
