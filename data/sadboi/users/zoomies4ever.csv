Anxiety,fcsv3e7,t3_eiafhw,1577925863.0,"Well, at least it's nice to realize I'm not alone on this. This has been happening to me since my teens but I think it has gotten worse in the last few years. I remember being always kinda sad but now it was worse since I was a bit stressed because of college. I kept accidentally dropping things and a crying in the bathroom, then I broke a plate and started crying in the kitchen, which at least added variety to my crying places. I guess each year it becomes more obvious that I have no idea what I'm doing and the older I am the more I feel like I'm letting my loved ones down? Idk, I feel so old"
Anxiety,f1qgvcv,t3_dacxil,1569700531.0,"Definitely. It's the worst of both worlds, because you are supposed to give immediate replies like in direct conversation, but you can't see their facial expressions and gestures. This is fine in written communication because you can reflect on your answers, but on the phone silence is less tolerated and you need to keep on talking. So unless it is for a doctor's appointment or something I almost never reply to people outside my close family. Once someone from work gave my number to other co-workers without asking me and it filled me with anxiety for weeks"
Anxiety,ewngbyc,t3_cow80o,1565577418.0,"thanks!!! I finally built up the courage to send an email I had written but was too scared to send, asking about an event I really want to go (I may still not go bc anxiety but at least I took a step forward)"
Anxiety,etgpfpb,t3_cbm7vx,1562796062.0,"I'm going through a situation that's almost exactly like this. I started a job a few weeks ago and I feel the same way :(  

 In this exact moment I'm ignoring my phone because I'm getting notifications from work... I wish I could give you some good advice but I'm still trying to figure out what to do... but I guess you're not alone at least?"
