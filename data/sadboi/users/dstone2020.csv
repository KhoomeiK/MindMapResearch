Keep working on yourself and keep the faith, I woke up feeling similar but thank God for my girlfriend who pulls me out my funk. Try and make today a good one, at least the suns shining down us. More importantly, just know that you're not alone! Have a great dayðŸ˜Š"
depression,fhhve97,t3_f3636h,1581612511.0,"PLEASE DON'T DO IT!!! I was feeling the same way last night but I talked to my mother who is usually the source of my anxiety but today was different. Also, I met with a new doctor who really listened and has joined in on this fight with me and will start meeting with me regularly to make sure I stay on track. My point is that EVERYDAY brings new hope. PLEASE, PLEASE try it another way!! People love you and more importantly God   loves you!!!!!!ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š"
depression,fhftefk,t3_f30c5u,1581550870.0,"Wow thanks for sharing, really resonated with my life and I'm twice your age (38)! I've never expressed it as perfectly as this but I too feel like I'm attractive with a healthy amount of self esteem except the depression keeps me from accomplishing the big goals and dreams that I hide in my heart. Unlike you, I don't have a good support system of family and friends that actually believe in me which makes me constantly doubt myself. On the surface they appear to love me, especially  when it's convenient for them but when it comes to matters of the heart and my depression I don't feel the love so consider yourself lucky in that way."
depression,fdfjlfw,t3_el1q99,1578363225.0,Good for you!! Your such an inspiration for those who suffer in silence. God bless you!!

depression,faadma4,t3_e89fkq,1575907406.0,Try everyday to connect with the people in your life. Sure it's hard but depression is harder and lonelier. Fight  this thing! You're worth it your still here.
depression,f9va6tm,t3_e6wilf,1575665864.0,Yes!! I get kinda mad when my body won't let me sleep anymore ðŸ˜«ðŸ˜« lol
depression,f9ogpmc,t3_e68fkd,1575504145.0,Are you afraid to face the day? Does everything you have to do feel overwhelming?
depression,f96voxp,t3_e3sl6j,1575153150.0,"I agree with you. I feel the same sometimes. I just feel like I'm too depressed and sad to engage with people and not interesting enough for people to want to engage with me so I isolate and the vicious cycle continues. However, I believe the only escape from this cycle is to put yourself out there as much as possible and socialize with friends, family, strangers, etc. I know that I always lifts my spirits even if just for a moment. Sometimes you gotta fake it till you make it lol! Good luck to you!!"
depression,f8ghzvj,t1_f8g4fzr,1574559993.0,"You know I've wondered about that last part for some time now, wondering if I'm just blinded by all the hurt I still carry from my past. I just feel like everytime I try and open up and be honest and vulnerable I end up getting hurt, like really hurt because I'm still raw from my previous hurt. So as a result I'm hypersensitive to the slightest indiscretion whether it was good intentioned or not. I really hope that God can repair the hole in my heart before it's too late. Anyway, thanks for the birthday wish I just want to get through the rest of the day and sleep like a baby. Maybe tomorrow I will see things more clearly."
depression,f8fw7iu,t1_f8fm365,1574550277.0,Very true thank you for that perspective
