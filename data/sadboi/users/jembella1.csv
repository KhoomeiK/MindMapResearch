SampleSize,fq7fc4q,t3_gacb5w,1589145651.0,it would be nice if there was someway to sort surveys that offer a monetary value (bit like how you can sort between casual/academic/marketing) like amazon vouchers etc.

CPTSD,fi1myd7,t3_f5tez5,1582060870.0,it's very draining.
ptsd,fi1jfx4,t3_f5oaix,1582058940.0,tbh i was just open from the start. if they can't accept the bad then they aren't worth the good. everyone is different.
ptsd,fi1j7af,t3_f5vef6,1582058811.0,it certainly sounds like a trauma of somesort. no need to say sorry here. i think we all struggle on this subreddit and that's partly why we are here - to support one another. any neglect or a dysfunctional relationship in the household is going to bring about alot of feelings years down the line. i guess it's whether or not we can cope with it alone and asking for help isn't a bad thing. i hope this helps? i hope you get support also.

CPTSD,fhh0suo,t1_fhgzebu,1581588359.0,maybe so. i think it's almost the fact i just can't hold it inside anymore. it hurts too much
ptsd,fhgkku3,t1_fhgjzi9,1581569731.0,I can only try talking to the doc to see what he says. Thank you.
pics,fhgjrv3,t3_f2z8vi,1581569071.0,Wow.
ptsd,fhgjhlw,t1_fhgiva4,1581568835.0," I know it's not what you mentioned at all but 
by explaining My situation might help. My doctor doesn't agree with prescribing me sleeping tablets, but I haven't had a chance to update him about the therapy session yesterday. Maybe that might make him reconsider? I don't know. 

To be fair I'm already on Prozac 40mg/day and I think he's weary of putting me on more pills. But no regarding prazosin - I have never even heard of it until you mentioning it. Maybe it could be a possibility but I don't know."
ptsd,fhgijud,t1_fhgbwzb,1581568085.0,"It sounds like it will be hard but one day at a time I guess. Putting it into words as you've done makes it feel close to home. Bf kept pushing me in a kind way of doing volunteering. Only can manage a couple hours a week but he was prodding the idea for about 4 months. Found it so hard, and I guess it explains why it is so hard"
ptsd,fhgi9j1,t1_fhgfz99,1581567864.0,Exactly. Being verbally and physically abused over the years certainly puts its toll on living day to day constantly on edge. But to find a community in a subreddit like this does make it so much more real and outside of my head
ptsd,fhg6ub8,t1_fhg6guh,1581559930.0,Oh right. Sorry. I am fearful almost as even to try and prepare myself for it means it's more real..like I know it's real but idk it's so hard to explain :(
ptsd,fhg6ksd,t1_fhftuiq,1581559762.0,It sounds like a different life. I'm glad things are ok for you now.
ptsd,fhg6i74,t1_fhfvith,1581559716.0,Erm I'll try if I remember. Sounds appalling but my memory is terrible except the more vivid stuff if that makes sense

ptsd,fhg6bf9,t1_fhfnmtn,1581559595.0,Erm I'm not sure yet. It will be a trauma chart and some kind of finger technique 24 times in comparison to REM sleep I think and involve all the different traumas to try and desensitize from it. Something like that. No idea

ptsd,fhfmle0,t1_fhfm02w,1581546502.0,"yeah. it really puts into perspective human behaviour. i guess it is huge. that's the thing. if it was someone else i'd see it as huge. but because it's just me i see it as selfish. to be fair i don't even know how to like myself. i never learned how to. relief is definitely a word to use though. what a road to go as well. just. at least places like this subreddit are supportive, it's just nice to have someone to can understand. they may have not been in the same exact boat. but they are struggling out at sea too and they see what i see sometimes? thanks for your reply."
ptsd,fhfiyt5,t1_fhfim01,1581544324.0,i'm glad things are working for you. maybe i will be there one day. i don't understand how but i'm alive so there's hope..i guess?
ptsd,fhfive5,t1_fhfi5rs,1581544268.0,"wow. sorry life was brutal like that to you. yeah. being hyperware, doubts, nightmares, nightterrors, i guess something was going to give eventually. it's not easy when you've buried it for so long and thought well this is how life is these days. almost to the point of beyond accepting it but with bitterness, and questioning.

 hard to explain. yeah hopefully this therapist will guide me someplace better, i don't know."

ptsd,fhfhir0,t1_fhfgxn4,1581543487.0,ah okay. at least there is something online. i think each test might be slightly different. either way it was definitely eye opening today.
ptsd,fhfgkdp,t1_fhfcegw,1581542942.0,i knew it was bad but i never knew it was this bad. yeah it's a weird feeling.hope things get better for you. it's a hard road

ptsd,fhf3xti,t1_fhf3tvd,1581535718.0,i've been so misunderstood for years..notably just with myself. blaming myself..an answer to explain why..it's something.
ptsd,fhf3q3a,t1_fhf290v,1581535593.0,yeah i've been getting help for a while but noone ever pinpointed to me it was ptsd
ptsd,fheuau0,t1_fhesod3,1581530058.0,it's just nice to have an answer explaining why im the way i am. i just hope the therapy helps even though its brutal but i guess it has to be. the trauma was brutal.
