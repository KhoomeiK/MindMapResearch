Putting those mechanics anywhere else only makes those formats into inferior versions of commander, instead of making them better versions of themselves by injecting part of another popular format into them, like Wizards seemed to think would happen.

Speaking of commander, the companion mechanic should've only worked in formats with commanders (commander and brawl, mainly), although of course Lutri's and Yorion's requirements would need to be changed, but that's not a big deal. Those formats aleady have cards starting outside the game, as well as the possibility of multiple cards doing so.

Veil kills two colors for an entire turn, specifically the only ones that can deal with noncreature spells and especially planeswalkers before they get their value, all the while allowing the Veiled player to do pretty much whatever they want for a turn outside of getting hit by burn or Path.

At the same time, some threats are so powerful and resilient that the only way to actually deal with them is to take them, which is only made worse in Brawl (and I guess EDH, but EDH has more ways to deal with things) since they can keep recasting their commander and due to the state of ramp the commander tax is basically inconsequential (hell, with Fires, it's literally the only cost you have to pay)."

Cards just need to have a reasonable weakness (many of which can simply be those inherent to the rules, like summoning sickness) and ideally there wouldn't be cards that basically win the game by themselves, or at least make things seem hopeless for the opponent (although maybe it's okay-ish if they require a lot of setup and/or actually win the game on the spot instead of make things hopeless for the opponent for a few turns).

Too many of the cards we see have no reasonable weakness and/or have their weakness nullified by something (usually T3feri more often than not, at least now that Veil's started to eat bans). Besides the only real weakness of PWs being counterspells, which are basically useless while T3feri exists, cards that used to be balanced by high or difficult mana costs aren't now that ramp is insane (and basically risk-free) and Fires exists, etb creatures are only weak to counterspells (T3feri strikes again) or Hushbringer (which is really easy to kill), companions don't even need to be drawn and can't be discarded, etc."

However, the cycling deck also relies on incremental damage like attacking with cheap creatures and triggers from cards like [[Drannith Stinger]]. In fact, at least in my experience, that's where most of the damage comes from, and Zenith Flare is usually less of the main wincon and more of either a backup plan or the last few points of damage needed.

TL;DR: Get a void relic, go into a void fissure mission with it, complete it, and you get a prime part/blueprint. Then repeat until you get all 3 or 4 parts/BPs you need and craft it. Or just trade for it.

You just need to get a void relic, which can come from endless missions (survival, defense, interception, etc.), missions in the Void, bounties from Fortuna and Cetus, etc. You can find out what relic has what items or where those relics drop from the wiki or the Codex under Relics and Arcanes. Then you take a relic into the right kind of void fissure mission (Lith, Meso, Neo, etc.), which is just a normal mission with some extra Corrupted enemies (that are scaled to the mission's level, so it's not really more difficult than normal), which you need to kill to get enough reactant to open your relic. When you extract, if you got 10 reactant, your relic opens up to reveal one of the blueprints or parts inside, and everyone gets to pick which player's relic's drop they want.

The thing is, which item drops from your relic is determined by RNG, but you can increase the chance of getting an uncommon or the rare drop by upgrading it with void traces you get from void fissure missions. You also need 3-4 specific parts/blueprints from relics to be able to make a prime item.

As for condi warrior, most condition warrior builds are actually using the Berserker elite spec, which at least to me (a condi berserker main) feels a lot different and less boring compared to warrior, at least in terms of theme. Berserkers are running around setting everything on fire, including themselves, headbutting everything, and using their secret power that they gained through gaining an elite spec. Sure, Chronos can mess with time, Soulbeasts can do the DBZ fusion dance with Fido, and Holosmiths invented lightsabers, but Berserkers can get REALLY. FUCKING. *ANGRY*. So that's cool.

But yeah, playing condi berserker is really fun to me both thematically since I'm constantly setting everything (including myself and the battlefield) on fire and gameplay-wise since there's a decent skill ceiling in maximizing your time in ~~ANGRYTOWN~~ berserk mode. Instead of core warrior's schtick of building up adrenaline and releasing it in a big adrenaline burst, berserkers build it all up to go into berserk mode for a certain amount of time, which limits their max adrenaline to one bar while active, but lets them use their berserk bursts (you get to leave a long trail of fire on the ground with your bow, for one). They can increase the amount of time in berserk mode by using their new ""rage"" skills, which is where some of the higher skill ceiling comes in. I dunno, I like it and I think it's worth a shot, at least by taking a character to the PvP lobby and seeing how it feels.

In terms of viability, it's actually really viable in endgame content, both as a source of the unique banner buffs and as DPS, and can go with or without the banners if your squad already has that covered (or you could go each take one), which makes it much easier to spend the vast majority of your time in berserk mode."

Warframe,fq00luf,t3_gfwrjn,1589026344.0,"TL;DR: Rhino. Also, you don't need to spend/trade plat for frames/prime parts (I still haven't), but you can if you want.

Pretty much any frame can do well, especially in the early game. The frames you have access to in the early game are obviously the starter frames (Excal's blueprints can be farmed from the boss on Mars, while Mag's come from Phobos' boss, and Volt's can be bought with credits from a clan's Tenno lab), as well as Rhino (Venus' boss, the Jackal), and the other frames that can be bought from the Tenno lab: Banshee, Nezha, Volt, Wukong, and Zephyr. There's also Oberon, but it's really inconsistent to farm his BPs, since they drop from Eximus enemies, but only have a certain chance of dropping, instead of being guaranteed to drop one like the bosses.

Of those, the starter frames, Rhino, and Wukong are probably the ones I'd recommend. Rhino especially has great survivability and damage buffs, while Wukong has a twin that fights alongside you as well as ""extra lives."" You might have trouble getting enough Nitain to build Wukong until Nightwave returns later this month, so I'd go with Rhino.

You can buy frames from the market for platinum, and if you want to that's fine (iirc, any frame you buy orebuilt from the market comes with a pre-applied Orokin Reactor to double the mod capacity) but most frames are pretty easy to farm and build. The same idea goes with buying prime access frames or trading for prime frame BPs (often with platinum). You can if you want, but it's not necessary, especially since you'll be fine without prime frames for some time. I farmed for Mesa Prime pretty easily, as well as a few other Primes. You just need to get the right void relics (you can search the wiki or the codex for what relics have the prime parts you want and where they drop from) or get matched up with someone who does, then do void fissures until you get the right parts (you'll also probably want to upgrade any relics that you want the uncommon or rare rewards from by using the void traces you get from fissure missions). Some Primes have been ""vaulted,"" meaning the relics with their BPs in them don't drop anymore. In those cases you'll either need someone who has the relic to go on a run with you or you'll need to trade for the right BPs."

magicTCG,fpvfpma,t1_fpsve35,1588943754.0,"The thing is that power isn't necessarily bad, as long as there are checks on it. It's possible to have high power formats that aren't anywhere near this oppressive and Solitaire-esque. Just look at the standards before WAR, especially DOM-RNA. Besides the mistake that is Nexus (and Buy-A-Box exclusives in general), it was pretty high powered but balanced. That's because there wasn't a huge gap between the power of threats and answers, there was at least a decent answer for most everything, and the threats didn't have as much built-in resilience or as much value even when removed immediately. I just don't want WotC to get the wrong message and drop Standard's average power level down to BFZ levels or lower, and they'd probably still mess things up by pushing their face cards like Gideon AoZ was, which back then was only exacerbated by the low power of most everything else (especially the answers. Not only was burn non-existent, but the one PW kill spell in Standard at the time was a sorcery, but by the time you could cast it, Gideon already had an emblem or made a creature).

Although I do recognize that we've got some of the most powerful and resilient threats ever printed right now, and personally I'd like to see the power dropped down a tiny bit, moved in a different direction, and spread out across colors/archetypes/playstyles, I still think that things could be salvaged into almost healthy formats, but WotC needs to crank the power of answers way up and get creative with them if they want to keep the power level this high and even if they don't but don't want to require mass bannings across multiple formats (which honestly would be nice, at least with some of the current crop). I'm talking [[Hero's Downfall]] that costs 1 less (and maybe even draws a card or investigates) if it targets a walker, abilities that trigger when walkers ETB so you can actually respond before they can activate their ability, some effect that gives walkers summoning sickness, cards that kill a creature or walker and [[Stifle]] its ability, instant speed [[Solemnity]] until end of turn that actually hits walkers this time, [[Sorcerous Spyglass]] variants that turn off static abilities as well, ways to punish cheating on mana (like [[Lavinia|RNA]], but good, or a counterspell that's free if the targeted spell was cast without paying mana, and maybe even has more of a bonus in that case like drawing a card or being uncounterable) or UG's crazy ramp/draw (just reprint [[Balance]] or make some variant of it, maybe even just costing a bit more, or make some land destruction spell that only works if your opponent has multiple lands more than you), etc. Fixing T3feri might be a bit more difficult (and is one of the cards I'm 110% in favor of banning everywhere), but [[Shark Typhoon]] is a step in the right direction, and other abilities like it (and ~~[[Yidaro]]'s~~ GOJIRA's as well) would be great. Companions...I'm drawing a blank for outside of [[Drannith Magistrate]] and making the mechanic itself only work in Commander and Brawl (like it should've in the first place).

I think I lost my point there, but it was that high power formats can be balanced if there's a check on the power, but right now WotC seems so loathe to print effective answers that it reminds me of how it took them two blocks to print graveyard hate (besides one card that only exiled a single card) for SOI the graveyard focused block while THS block itself and the following Khans block contained numerous hate cards for the gods (like [[Erase]], [[Deicide]], and [[Revoke Existence]]), and their insistence on making their threats naturally resistant to removal (uncounterable, on-cast triggers, ETB triggers, really high loyalty, the mere existence of T3feri and Veil, etc.) doesn't  exactly fill me with confidence. However, I'm almost certain that even if they dropped the average power level, things wiuld still be at least as unbalanced and unfun if not moreso."
magicTCG,fpuj4op,t1_fptakjw,1588914253.0,"Companions would've been great if the mechanic only worked in Commander (and I guess Brawl and the like). Not only does commander already have you starting with an extra card or two that's always in your opening hand and immune to discard, they're also used to high power jank, plus it's also much more interesting from a flavor perspective that your commander has a pet (King Kenny loves his good pupper [[Zirda]]) than the semi-cringy idea that WotC clearly wanted to push of you having your companion as a pet. Plus figuring out how to fulfill deckbuilding constraints is much more interesting in a singleton format than in other formats. Hell, they could even have them be recastable like commanders and it would be like a modified version of partner that works with even non-partner commanders.

I'm actually kinda sad now that they didn't just do that, especially with this being their ""year of commander,"" plus Ikoria's reception would've been much better, even if the companions were in the set but not able to be used as companions. Sure, they would've had to change [[Lutri]]'s and maybe [[Yorion]]'s requirements (I'm not sure if EDH decks have to be exactly 100 cards or if that's just the minimum, but my [[Battle of Wits]] dreams are hoping it's the latter), but that's not hard to do."
magicTCG,fpuff3j,t1_fptcsvo,1588911542.0,"TL;DR: Not only are they too powerful, but the answers to them are too weak, both objectively and comparatively. The summoning sickness idea is a great one that they should really implement. Also I just rant incoherently for a really long time.

One of the biggest issues with PWs isn't just that they're *conceptually* difficult to deal with (which I think they are, at least in a favorable way, but I'll get to that), it's that in practice they're hard to deal with because of how they and the ways they're supposed to be answered are designed.

Planeswalkers, like many things these days, are often designed to be must answer cards, but their answers are inefficient, expensive, rare, and/or few in number. Burn spells are supposed to be a good way to deal with walkers, but with many of them getting higher and higher starting and post-first-activation loyalty, burn spells are getting less and less effective, sometimes needing multiple spells to kill one walker. Black and other colors only get a few clean (and ideally permanent) planeswalker removal spells, both in any given standard and at all, which outside of [[Dreadbore]] from 8 years ago, [[Assassin's Trophy]], and [[The Elderspell]], all either cost 3+ mana (meaning that if you're trying to kill a three mana walker, you both spent three same amount of mana and cards but they're up a card's worth of value from their first activation) and/or have some restrictions, and until recently were almost entirely rares. 

It also is annoying that walkers are excluded from effects that hit pretty much everything else. [[Solemnity]] would be a great anti-walker hate card but only hits literally everything else (including combing with [[Dark Depths]]!), [[Bounty Agent]] also hits every other kind of legendary nonland permanent, [[Statue]], [[Vraska, Relic Seeker]], [[Angelic Purge]], and many more hit every nonland permanent *but* planeswalkers. Same with even T3feri, although at least that means that mirror matches aren't just bouncing eachother's Teferis until one person gets enough mana to win the inevitable counter war...or just bouncing your own to get to draw a second card every turn without endangering the best card in your deck. 

Removal being mainly rares, inefficient/ineffective, and few in number I can at least see some semi-justifiable reason, but excluding planeswalkers from cards that hit everything else, especially since it would be better to read (e.g. ""counters can't be put on artifacts, creatures, enchantments, or lands"" vs ""counters can't be put on permanents""), better for future-proofing (just in case they add more permanent types), and better for the health of the game and format is inexcusable and another example of them heavily pushing ~~their marketing vehicles~~ planeswalkers. 

Not to mention that they're getting more powerful, more resilient, and more able to protect themselves and present a threat at the same time. The idea that they can be killed through combat is becoming less and less possible as more of them are able to create significant board presence, and not just at no loyalty cost; they're in fact *gaining* loyalty by doing so *and* forcing you to spend multiple removal cards to answer their one card.

Planeswalkers are also difficult to interact with slightly because of problems inherent to the card type itself as well. The fact that the only way to stop a planeswalker from getting their first activation off is by countering it (*shakes fist at [[Chandra, Awakened Inferno]]*) or the ability itself (but cards that do so are extremely narrow outside of [[Disallow]]) is a problem. Sure, black can disrupt their hand *if* it's even there when they look, and the same sort of thing applies to cards like [[Sorcerous Spyglass]] (less so if you already know it's in the deck) except they can also just be removed before the PW comes down. 

I love and 110% agree with the idea that they should have summoning sickness. Even if they don't want to change the rules, they could at least print cards that would do so, like:

>'Walking Sickness 3  
>Enchantment  

>Players can't activate loyalty abilities of planeswalkers that entered the battlefield this turn.

It's probably not a very good card (although if I stick ""draw a card"" onto it...) nor a well templated one, but you get the idea. If WotC continues to print walkers anywhere near the current power level, they'll need to either change the rules to give them summoning sickness or make actual answers for them that are even in the general ballpark, like abilities that triggered when walkers ETB so you can actually have priority before they can activate their ability, maybe even one that just dealt a bit of damage to the walker when it entered, as well as cards that could both kill planeswalkers/creatures and counter their activated ability at the same time, or even an instant speed Solemnity that hit walkers and lasted until end of turn (being a quasi-counterspell for walkers and most hydras). There's a lot of design space there to make an environment where walkers can be powerful but not oppressive, but WotC has so far been extremely conservative with anything that could touch walkers. 

And don't get me wrong, before 2019 I was totally fine with walkers, I was even a fan of some of them, and there have even been some that came out since like Calix that have been balanced and well designed examples of what walkers used to be (even back in RNA and a few specific examples in WAR like Jace or Sarkhan): cards that were strong *if* you built your deck around their theme, not just cards that should go in every deck that can fit their color and CMC. I'd rather we go back to walkers like that instead of what we have now, but if WotC wants to keep pushing them, they need to make answers light-years more powerful, cheap, and plentiful than they are now or Magic will just be a coin flip to decide who gets to play Solitaire and who has to watch.

Shit, I need to stop ranting so much."
magicTCG,fptghhw,t1_fptdgeq,1588890813.0,">""oh no, they're bringing Genn and Baku to Magic.""

Hell, we literally have even and odd decks now. With that and a lot of other bad decisions, from egregious and obvious ones like T3feri and Fires enforcing Hearthstone-esque play for everyone, to more subtle ones like dictating the metagame through design, making most decks focus on a single card or two, or ramp and other consistency mechanics meaning you'll always have enough mana without having to sacrifice anything for it, not to mention Companions being both sort of like start of game effects and classes, it's obvious WotC wants Magic to be Hearthstone. However, there's a reason (okay, actually multiple reasons) that I stopped playing Hearthstone, and if Magic keeps down this path, I can't see myself playing it for much longer either."
magicTCG,fpt73mn,t1_fpt1e6y,1588886019.0,"We're more in a midrange/ramp meta coming off of a midrange/ramp/aggro meta that had *a* control deck. Midrange is about surviving the early few turns and then slamming down big threats, which is exactly what Fires, Uro, Lukka, Winota, and pretty much the majority of the rest of the top decks do. Looking at MTGGoldfish, the first hard control deck is #17 in the meta, with 1.19% meta share. Otherwise, Reclamation is the closest thing to a control deck in the top 15, and that's mainly a few counters to protect Reclamation until they can win a few turns later, plus some Flame Sweeps. Fires may have T3feri, Elspeth's Undeadening, and a few sweepers, but it's mainly about plopping down Fires and slamming down two giant threats a turn until they win, which won't take long because the threats are huge, have insane value and usually replace themselves multiple times over, and Wizards is allergic to printing actually half-decent answers, which still wouldn't be enough because the threats, both in Fires and everywhere else, are out of control and spending time and mana to answer them just puts you behind unless that answer is also a bigger threat."
PioneerMTG,fprp7m1,t1_fppn0fh,1588859300.0,"The thing is, we *did* have powerful yet relatively healthy standards as recently as RNA and GRN (sans Nexus and big Teferi, but even then, at the time they were the exception, not the rule) and *could* very well have more powerful yet still healthy standards in the future. 

One of the biggest differences between then (and other healthy standards) and now is that pretty much everything had an answer or counterplay. Most things could be favorably interacted with, and the power of threats and the power of answers were pretty closely related, or at the very least there wasn't a gigantic gap in between. Nowadays, by the time you can interact with something, you're either spending more mana to remove the threat than they did, or they still got insane value from it (or both). Meanwhile, answers have gotten more expensive and less powerful, while threats have gotten more resilient, cheaper, and much much more powerful.

Tune the threats down a bit and ratchet the answers way back up so that they're pretty close to the power of what they're answering, and you've got a much better balance to build a powerful yet healthy format on, you can just raise the power level equally across the board, like DOM-RNA did with Ixalan block's level playing ground."

At least they changed it from gating until each reset to gating for two hours after you finish a collection, although I still think they should've limited time gating to the crafting aspects only (especially since they ended up having both types of time gates)."

magicTCG,fpnn43m,t1_fplctij,1588767915.0,"Yep! DOM-RNA were my favorite sets and standards since Khans block in large part because they upped the power level and did so pretty evenly across the board. Most colors and color combos were relatively equal, and while UWx control and RDW were the tier 1 decks, everything else, even jank, wasn't far behind, and could even beat the tier 1 decks with some skilled play and maybe a little luck (and/or lifegain). Outside of a few combo decks (and Teferi Nexus, which was both combo and control...and torture...and a mistake, but thankfully an outlier), decks didn't just revolve around one or two cards, but instead worked with cards that worked towards a similar gameplan and/or had synergy together. Most importantly, threats weren't miles ahead of answers and interaction.

Now they took the board and lifted it by one end so hard that it's now vertical. Threats are so powerful that it's almost impossible to favorably interact with them, at least before they've gotten insane value out of them. Interaction's all but dead outside of slowing down their value machine so yours can speed ahead, and even then it usually has to be stapled to a threat or other big value to be worth playing. Decks are focused around a few cards that win the game by themselves (Fires, Uro/Nissa, companions, etc.), even including decks that would've relied on synergies, like lifegain decks (Heliod and Pridemate) or sacrifice (Catfood combo, Mayhem Devil, and formerly Korvold), or a similar gameplan like RDW (Torbran, Anax, and Embercleave) or UWx control (T3feri). As such, if you're not running one of the insanely OP cards as the fulcrum of your deck, you've basically already lost before the game began.

How do you deal with a huge creature that draws a card, drops a land, and gains life every time it ETB or attacks, and that can recur itself? How do you deal with a creature that turns all your artifacts into mana rocks, and can cast you a random spell for free? How do you deal with a creature that its owner gets to draw for free at the start of every game and that's immune to discard? How do you deal with one of those that lets you recast your best permanent spell and leaves an extra body behind?

I mean, technically counterspells, but...

How do you deal with a planeswalker like T3feri, who blanks all your counterspells while 3(or more)-for-1-ing you by bouncing something, drawing a card, and eating removal, all while not letting you do anything until it's your main phase (so you lose out on any open mana or spells you wanted to cast on their turn unless you cast them in response, and if it's a non-walker nonland permanent, it'll get bounced anyway)?

Also technically counterspells, but what if you're not playing blue? And even if you are how do you deal with a card that counters all counterspells and a large amount of removal, protects you and all your stuff from all counterspells and a large amount of removal for an entire turn, and draws you a card, all for a single mana?

The damage has already been done to eternal formats.
