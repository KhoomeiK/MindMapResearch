It doesn't really sound like that big of a problem imo.

What i meant was just keep the door open to your room to allow for a little more air exchange in the room. Small rooms get stuffy sometimes with the doors closed when its hot in the house at night. Do you have a fish tank in the room by any chance or any other source of moisture besides your body's exhalation. If you are in the basement you'll also have slightly higher humidity."

Im 2 months sober and im feeling better but also worse in other ways. All 3 times i didn't realize i was experiencing phycosis. Now ive got alot to look back at and it's difficult to stay sober and difficult to let go of the past.

Part of what made me realize i needed to quit the weed was the violent full body shakes id get seconds after smoking. My voice would shake, my breath would shake, id lie down and my body would shake for hours. Id have racing thoughts and think that everyone was talking about me. The tv, people, the internet, the past memories. This went on for about a year and influenced me heavily while not high.

My problem is i know how to get just about any drug i want off the internet and its a constant struggle to not do it. 

I'm really struggling with impulses at the moment and im going form being anxious all day for a few days to having no energy at all. All i can do at this point is to try and distract myself form the anxiety.

Im not really able to enjoy anything anymore and ive lost myself to my moods and impulses. I don't know myself anymore. The only thing that seems to help is sleep, distractions that waist time but arnt harmful (hobbies if you have them), medating (cant do self guided meditation because of the racing thoughts but i can still do guided meditation because focusing on their voice calms me down), and listening to podcasts or people like ram dass speak (helps give me perspective). 

Im going to be on meds for the rest of my life. i accept that. My behavior patterns are too deeply rooted in me to manage without meds. Ive found CBT and ACT helpful but to actually apply t when i need it off meds is extremely difficult. On meds that work i am a totally different person.

I used to take lithium and was at a 0.6/0.7 for years along with  Escitalopram  but i was fearful of upping my dosage with either med. I was on a starting dose of  Escitalopram  and it helped a little. 

I was afraid of the dehydration associated with the lithium causing brain damage because i worked outside. Wore a lot of sun screen too because it makes you more susceptible to sun burns.

It was like that before i tried zyprexa and before i self medicated with ephedrine and a high dose and things are back to base line. So hopefully i can find a new med.
