Know what you are going to sing, and use your hands to help you visualize going up in pitch. eg. if you are singing a high note raise your hand a little higher for every little bit higher you sing."

singing,fb3hjwd,t3_eb4rmf,1576473333.0,High notes are freaking loud. Just accept that fact and embrace it.

singing,f9wpj0c,t3_e791e2,1575696557.0,"Practice, Practice, practice! Be confident in what you were singing, and once you put yourself out there once it will keep getting easier and easier. Just pretend that the people aren’t there and sing out like you normally would. Trying to sing quieter or singing less when you’re in front of people often makes you sound worse and just think how you normally would sing and it will sound so much better."

singing,f9wkibf,t1_f9visyi,1575694110.0,For me I was just singing a song and I was home alone and felt comfortable and I just reached for a high note and realized that I was no longer completely in my chest voice. Then I tried to replicate it again and again until I could transition more smoothly. It took me about a six months to figure it out. I dont have a voice teacher though
singing,f9ublmg,t3_e702go,1575647853.0,I like it. You have good pitch
AskReddit,f9ub9oc,t3_e6xk3u,1575647690.0,"A way to pick what classes the best help you with your career path. Let’s say I want to become a cosmetologist, I know I don’t have to take all the high levels of math but I will not understand. But if I want to become a doctor I have to take algebra because you need it for chemistry, but not necessarily geometry."
singing,f9npgcu,t3_e61n4b,1575488491.0,Ive heard some people say that sugar makes your larynx fat and makes it harder to sing.
singing,f9n3wby,t1_f9n2nhl,1575476453.0,"So the best way to find your mix is basically just make crazy sounds, or go to YouTube and watch YouTube videos on how to do it because these people can give you exercises to help you do it. Sometimes a lot of technical jargon can make things more confusing."

singing,f9m2fzd,t1_f9kbpou,1575439118.0,Im good friends with both of the vocalists and me and the lead female vocalist are best friends. We have good chemistry when it comes to that stuff. We’ll just look at each other and start singing the same song and harmonizing with each other. It would be really cool to be able to sing and worship along side her.
singing,f9m24r5,t1_f9kbpou,1575438808.0,Thanks for the advice!! I’ll try to use it!
ALS,f9k0vw4,t3_e57z4o,1575390342.0,"My dad has ALS and Parkinsons. He was diagnosed well over 5-6 years ago and you would never know he had it unless someone td you. He has Lung onset so he has limited lung function but it doesn’t impact his day to day life that much. The Parkinsons is the hardests as a family member to deal with because he will have sudden mood swings. Like he’ll obsess over small things and then yell at me saying I can’t do anything right. I know it’s not him, it’s the Parkinsons but it doesn’t make it easier"

depression,f9jyh9r,t1_f8v41ub,1575388769.0,Thanks. It’s just my dad doesn’t want me to know and he’s very prideful. He would get mad that my mom told me (I already knew but she didn’t know that)
depression,f8u4gh9,t3_e261ih,1574818985.0,Me too
Anxiety,f8u2gz6,t3_e25zov,1574817456.0,Yes. I do this too. It’s really aggravating when my mom tells me to stop but I can’t and she just tells me to get over myself
depression,f8u17ep,t3_dpl4bu,1574816488.0,"I feel like this is me. But it’s gotten significantly worse over the last year or so. I think it’s been brought on by the fact that I found out that my dad has ALS and Parkinsons and my parents didnt tell me for years. I found out and couldnt tell anyone so that kinda screwed me up trying to process it all mostly on my own. I have a therapist for different reasons but I dont feel like i can talk to her or anyone. I used to be top of my class but now I’m failing everything. I’m homeschooled, and I have to essentially teach myself because I don’t do online school its all textbooks and paper. I can’t get anything done and my parents lecture me for being lazy. I can’t concentrate. I feel like I’m gonna explode if I have to read one more page of science. I used to be in to music a lot. I play four instruments and I would play literally for hours and sing a lot. Now i barely practice at all. I feel so frustrated and stuck. My mom now knows that I know about my dad but he doesn’t know that I know. So I can’t even defend myself when they call me lazy and my keeps telling me that I cant keep using my dads issues as an excuse for not keeping up with school but honestly i just want to jump off a freaking bridge. Im miserable and I hate myself. I constantly question my existence and wonder what would happen if I crashed the car into a pole or if I pointed a gun at my head and pulled the trigger. But then I hang out with friends and everything is fine and I can have fun with them and it’s so confusing. Am I depressed?? Wtf is wrong with me?"
