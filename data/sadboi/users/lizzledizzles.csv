With bad sinus infections, I will take Mucinex (guafenisin) without the decongestants added and it works better for me.

Hang thought of it that way before. From the perspective of being open about the anxiety and depression, I appreciate the way Rinna discusses her daughters bc it seems to be with their permission and is a good example of how it‚Äôs ok to step back from school or move back home when you‚Äôre dealing with mental health diagnoses. There‚Äôs so much stigma with not being able to finish school in 4 years or needing your family as a support network and living at home after 18 when dealing with severe anxiety/depression. That her daughters felt comfortable reaching out to their mom for help and making steps to share how rehab and therapy helped them as advocates made me feel like Rinna does a good job supporting them."

LifeProTips,fp8hsvd,t1_fp8hh2n,1588392656.0,"Well when you are very depressed, you need to find a way to get simple tasks done. Adding a physical indicator to remind yourself to start or do a habit helps.

Also brushing your teeth in a bathroom is unhygienic because toilets are right next to sinks, which are where your toothbrushes live for many people."
LifeProTips,fp8h0i1,t1_fp8gbg0,1588392073.0,"These were a game changer for me! Highly recommend. I also tie tooth brushing to another action so it‚Äôs easier to remember, like brushing while in the shower etc."
LifeProTips,fp8go9d,t3_gboqvm,1588391826.0,"Something is better than nothing! Saying as a person who‚Äôs worked through multiple episodes. Eat a snack if you can‚Äôt make a meal. Hang up a few things if you can‚Äôt clean your whole room. Write a title page if you can‚Äôt write a page or a paper. Wash your face if you can‚Äôt shower. Small successes build up until you can take care of bigger things again!

Editing to add: the spur of the moment thing is so true. Just today I thought about going for a run in the afternoon, and the second time I had the thought I made it into a feeling and acted on it. If you let yourself think too hard or wait, you will find a reason not to do it.

Took a lot of practice, including me saying I can‚Äôt talk about this right now bc I need to process the feeling and him being willing to wait. I think the weight of emotion in the moment affects recall for the ADHD person much more, putting us at a ‚Äúdisadvantage‚Äù from a winning a debate standpoint. Shifting it to solving a problem together works better for us."

ADHD,fp8fr09,t1_fp83y9v,1588391157.0,"My impression from my latest evaluation was that not being able to recognize or name those patterns/poor memory recall is indicative of ADHD. The psychiatrist was a bit shocked how little of my childhood and high school I remembered in specific terms in regards to how I functioned etc. Even college, which wasn‚Äôt even a full decade ago I couldn‚Äôt recall as well anymore and I was only 30 at the time.

Noticing the trends is great, and your notes will help your conversation with the clinician but I wouldn‚Äôt stress too much about having exact data.

Editing to add: memory/recall issues isn‚Äôt the only factor, of course, but is def a symptom to be taken in context with the rest of your experiences."
ADHD,fp8f80w,t3_gbseq1,1588390787.0,"Same issue with my boyfriend! I brought it up to him in the context of discussing how to communicate better.

Yes, I do have memory issues because I literally have a disability and it‚Äôs stressful to not remember in the first place and frustrating when I‚Äôm told my memory can‚Äôt be correct even when I am POSITIVE about something that turns out to be correct. I‚Äôm insistent that instead of arguing, we frame it as a discussion limited to the current issue and facts to avoid devolving into us reading our texts back to each other to prove a point that never fixes anything."
