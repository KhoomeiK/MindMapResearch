My current car is a 2003 Forester XT RHD from japan his name is gump (gump the forester get it?), its a huge sleeper with mine hitting 0-60 in about 5.5-5.2 ( I have a larger than stock turbo), its a amazing medium between fun and practical, i would reccomend it to anyone. Just be careful because the feed lines to the turbo can clog often which is pretty costly."

On top of that using ""I'm young"" shouldn't be a crutch but I understand I'm quite young myself being 19. I have no right to tell anyone how to life their lives but from the bottom of my heart I believe in god and a part of that means I hope one day you will to.

I am most definitely NOT dating someone she is a person I talk to here and there, we have never slept together or anything of the sort if anything I have been trying to break contact with her cause I know leading her on would be awful. Lastly she didnt break up with me cause she wanted space quite the opposite actually, I was very neglectful, i wouldn't respond to texts and didn't show love honestly mainly due to I was extremely depressed for very long bouts of time, and i know what I did wrong, I maybe havent been working on myself enough I get that but right now I am trying to fix my mental health with a therapist and am working on being medicated for it, so its not as if I am not trying at all. and lastly the guy she is with tried multiple times throughout our relationship to get with her she just turned him down every time, but the last time he tried I had been ignoring her and being awful after the passing of my grandfather and a lot of issues within my family and he finally got his way. Also I am completely good with leaving her alone, I honestly think its the best course of action right now she can always contact me if she so wishes."
