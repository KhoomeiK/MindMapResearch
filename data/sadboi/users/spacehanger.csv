death,fr1ykdq,t3_glvnze,1589828121.0,"A very good friend of mine was in his first year of university and had been dating this girl from his dorm. One night she had a dream that she had died and got really upset. My friend was with her and said they should go on a walk and talk about it. Eventually she asked him if he was afraid to die, and he said no not at all, and went on to explain that he wanted to die climbing in the mountains (he was a huge outdoors men)

Literally a week later that is exactly what happened. He lead a small group of friends through the uni's outdoor club on a remote mountain hike and on the way back down he lost his footing and fell off a cliff. He was only 18. I miss him tons, but I also visited the area a couple years later and I kid you not it is one of the most gorgeous places I've ever seen. I know his spirit is free"

SuicideWatch,fp58qog,t1_fp3xt9n,1588320257.0,">but after the third year of you being gone they no longer do the memorial thing. They've forgotten.

I've lost a lot of good friends and some close family members, and I don't think if you were genuinely close with someone that you ever actually ""forget"" -- and in terms of ""no longer do the memorial thing"" this could be true in some aspects, but genuinely the main reason I've had to stop publicly doing so is honestly peer pressure. Its not that they get forgotten, it's that society pressures you to move on. So even if you're hurting and missing someone there is legitimately a social stigma against expressing that grief after more than a year or so has passed. Heck, sometimes even after a few months. I've experienced this stigma first hand for a number of years now. 

I help moderate a number of grief and bereavement support groups here on reddit and I can promise you people never really get forgotten (maybe until their loved ones/close circle are also gone) but it might be perceived as otherwise as people feel increasingly less comfortable expressing that grief in a public way. What does being 'forgotten' mean to you? I will miss and feel sad about the loss of my friends, my dad, even some people I hardly knew for the rest of my life, and I am certainly not alone in those feelings. 

Worth mentioning too, there is naturally also a certain kind of healing that does come with time after you've been through a loss. The truth is that healing has taken place over those three years, four years, however long since the death occured. 

What I've found is that while often (again if you were usually genuinely close/loved someone) the intensity of the loss itself can be very much the same for a long time, but the frequency with which the death pops into your brain lessens. I wouldn't call this being forgotten, but there is a level of healing that gets achieved, and that healing means the death simply cannot healthily occupy your thoughts all the time, not in the same way it does after it first occurs."

Anyway, so when I was a young child, probably 7 or 8, I was thrilled when I got an opportunity to go on a 'behind the scenes' tour with my local zoo - to witness the lions being fed.

 The hallway of the feeding building was very narrow, so you are practically right in front of them; metal bars and a couple feet are the only thing separating you. At that age, the lions face was probably on par with mine, or taller... I just so happened to end up right in front of the male lion. 

For having been so excited to get such an up close and personal view at such an amazing creature, I could not believe how TERRIFIED I felt. I have never felt a primal instinct kick in harder in my life, my entire body began *shaking* and all I wanted to do was run. I will always remember sensing that immense power.... And wanting to get as far away as I could from it.

So when I watch how close people get sometimes, whether in a cage or otherwise, I always recall that fear and have mad respect (at least mentally) for the people that can do this stuff...

What? How is mother bias a factor in the fact that Walter is a wanted meth kingpin??? Clearly a dangerous man, a wanted criminal druglord, running off with his baby unannounced, after a serious family altercation, is cause for concern? Not just to ""fictional cops"" either? 

>would do everything to protect them

I agree Walter cares for his children, but by going down his line of work he inherently put his whole family in danger in multiple ways, multiple times. Do you think anyone would have ever said to him *"" I will murder your infant daughter""* if he had stuck to being a chemistry teacher?? Not to mention the fallout of having to grow up with his legacy looming over their heads for life, amongst other things. I mean.... Ya know, I could go into more reasons why Walter isn't a great father. Though I don't think he's intentionally a directly bad father, ultimately I think Walter just conflated being able to be ""a provider"" with thinking he's being a ""good"" dad.... Which are actually two very different things and Walter misses the mark on this point often. Anyway, I'm getting off topic. Point being his fallback ""everything I do, I do it for this family"" is total bullshit. And so, someone needs to ""protect this family from the man that protects this family""


>Not kidnapping

I think this seems like a sensitive topic for you and so will just remind you that I'm discussing a fictional tv show. Perhaps it's not kidnapping in the strict sense of the term, but given the context of the events of the show, from the viewpoint of the characters, this seems an awful lot like grabbing a kid and running away from police enforcement with it.  Which, in common terms, I believe kidnapping would be a fitting term to use in the scenario.."
breakingbad,flpi2s6,t1_flphvns,1585359986.0,"I'm talking about from the viewpoint of law enforcement from the time Holly was taken. You don't think they would have been seriously concerned about Holly's welfare?

If a known, dangerous criminal and drug lord just took off with a baby after a knife altercation with his family, isn't considered to be an ""active threat"" to that child's welfare, I don't know what is?"

At what point does watching  Walter ""win"" still manage to satisfy the viewer more than seeing him getting taken down does?

Of course I fully knew that Walter was an SOB when he poisoned Brock and watched Jane die - but it was, admittedly, still kind of *fun* I guess, to root for a bad guy. It was easy to sympathize with Walter, things are written in such a way that it's simple at first to see things from his viewpoint alone - which often conveniently ignores the lives he's destroying in order to get his way. 

Though for me, after watching Skylar scream for her baby, the ""fun"" immediately stopped. I could no longer just ignore how evil he was for the sport of it; I then fully understood the ways I had been truly ignoring it up until that point. Again, speaking to the brilliance of the show, Walter has similar moments of these epiphanies, like when he does eventually return Holly, or he sees Walter Jr. protecting Skylar with the kitchen knife. That pulling back, dissociative frame in which that scene is shot is so perfect. That shot really summed up the same emotional quality I actually felt when Holly is taken. Its a ""oh fuck.....

 In the next viewings I was able to appreciate how trying Skylar's circumstances were and how involuntarily caught in the middle she was. Though not a perfect person all the same, she ultimately does get involved in Walt's business. The funny part is though that in some ways she's better at it than him, for instance she's a much better liar than Walter, and he resents that. 

Also regardless of any shortcomings she may have had, she and the rest of the White family would ultimately be paying the price for Walters mistakes for the rest of their lives; Hank certainly payed for it..

birthparents,fiscvl2,t3_f9ey4y,1582682412.0,"Oh gosh. I'm so sorry this is happening to you and I hope your situation improves. 

This is what happened to my adoption. My abusive adoptive parents tried to cut my birth family out my life basically as quickly as possible and went ahead with the adoption finalization ahead of schedule. They promised my birth family monthly visits, open contact etc etc but never kept their word - nor do I now believe they truly ever intended to do so. I know this doesn't sound encouraging. My advice is to document and record everything. Keep thorough notes and a timeline recorded, write down what was promised or gather evidence of it. Even record phone calls or conversations on the down low if you can. This is what my birth mother did and it's helped me tremendously as an adult to see the reality of the situation we were in; to understand that it was simply my aparents selfishness that kept us apart and never from a lack of trying or love from my birth family. Try to ask for mediation with the aparents from your adoption agency if you can.

This is a hard thing to get out of, and to walk on eggshells around the people you trusted with your baby is so terrible. All I can say is that if this goes downhill further, your child will one day likely see the truth of the situation if they are able to look past whatever narrative the adoptive parents gave them. I'm a firm believer in the fact that things do eventually work themselves out in one way or another. I personally just spent the past week reconnecting with my birth family and it was so wonderful, but it has still hurt us all very much to have been separated all this time. It's been a long road, 21 years, to get to this point for us. 

I would be weary if I were you unfortunately. This is why I hate adoption - aparents & agencies can say whatever they need to to get your baby and then can totally turn their backs on the birthfamily - who often have zero legal recourse once the adoption is finalized. It made me feel like I was just a purchase to my aparents and that my bfamily was just the packaging that came with the product that they thought could be thrown away (which of course they were supremely wrong about) Ultimately adoption is an industry. I'm sorry, I know that's intense. I'm hoping a resolve goes much easier for you. 

 Seek counsel about your concerns with the agency right away. I'm really hoping that you got those agreements from the aparents in writing or have witnesses.  Also important to keep in mind though that again, unfortunately, agencies tend to work for adoptive parents more, since they are technically the 'paying client'  

Good luck and please keep reaching out if you need to. I'm a moderator over on r/adoption if youd like to join us there too."

To me kinda harkens to the sample ""i have been over the rainbow and I found nothing there but very thin air"""
RationalPsychonaut,fis2nsd,t3_f9fp9h,1582676412.0,Uhm... Glad you're okay but yeah. That was pretty  irresponsible imo
theavalanches,firk4q3,t1_firitjl,1582665905.0,"Yeah, I'm aware and hyped! There's been some debate over whether to call the new track a 'teaser/intro/interlude' vs a 'single' and I've just kinda fallen into the ""teaser"" category. Love it nonetheless!!"
theavalanches,firgcwc,t1_fip3vw6,1582663871.0,So dope. This for sure makes me think it'll be the first single - how exciting. I'm so happy to be a part of this community. Wildflower changed my life forever and I have no doubts WWALY will be just as impactful. Seriously shed some tears when they released the new album concept description
theavalanches,firg9q8,t1_fipaksh,1582663822.0,Thanks!! It's been such a nice surprise!!!
theavalanches,firg7bp,t1_fiqscwf,1582663787.0,Hard to say! I feel like SoundMerch got the worse end of this deal giving me a free shirt + shipping lol
