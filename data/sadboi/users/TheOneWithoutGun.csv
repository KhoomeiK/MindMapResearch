He wants to take his life and feels like he is falling apart with no where to hold on to.
If you write him, that he might be falling apart now but he can pick himself up later on, then thats not at all what he feels like. You just went the opposite way in the conversation just like the other person that always told him the same thing. I can completely understand why you never want to respond to these posts on here, because advice doesn't help. Imagine a kid falling and the parent says, yeah don't worry you will get better and going on. Sounds weird to me. 
All parents usually do is be there, listen and take care of the wounds if there is any. Sheesh, i hope this makes any sense or else i will feel exactly like you^^ but atleast i tried : p"

No. This is inexcusable, I am to this date ashamed of myself, deeply deeply ashamed and if I wouldn't be so emtpy on tears because the last month has been just absolute shit I would probably mourn her death again, which makes me even more ashamed, since my problems can never in a 100 lifetimes compare to what she must have gone through.

So let me try to give you a little advice.
Fuck em.
Stress and anxiety are the way your subconcious tells you, that you have to act.
That you can't leave the things how they are right now. Cut yourself some slack man.
If you had breakdowns already than my words should sound true to you.
Its just all the bullshit thats piling up on you.
And you obviously don't want it.
And you know what else?
That's completely fine.
You are not weird or weak or anything.
But you have to stand for yourself and you can only do that by first embracing all the anxiety and stress and just accepting that its there.
Thats what you can work with.
Do you work in happines?
Few people do and they probably lie about being happy in the first place so don't worry man.
I'm sure that you can manage what you think you have to manage. And its less than you may think.
Gl man, you are on a good way, simply by seeing that something is wrong you are already above the most crucial hurdle.
If you want to talk some more, if you feel lost again don't hesitate to dm me. We are all just humans ... you are not alone"

Don't put up with her shit, and if you are scared of becoming the weird cousin, why worry? Stupid people will avoid you and smart people will want to hear your part of the story.

But let me ask you something, how do you measure if you are happy?
What is it to you?
Owning materialistic nonsens?
Having lot's of friends who can't wait to talk you?
I'm 100% sure, that there is something that makes you ""be ok with yourself"" because happines itself is just an ilusion. 
You don't have to be happy you know?
In fact, if you feel like that it's the best that can happen to you, if you feel like you can never be happy I mean.
Because it shows you, that the way things are right now, they all completely suck ass.
You can go at it however you like and the answer to the question can't be found within a couple lf google results, but where do you see yourself?
You can stay at home all day, do only the absolutely fking necessary stuff and still be a great human you know? And if you're sad even better. Because just your post alone, shows someone like me, that he is not alone.
We don't know each other but let me tell you, lower aaall your expectations you think you have to put on yourself, and then slowly raise your own personal standards just as you see fit. 
Now you might think, what is this dude trying to tell me, it's not going to make me happy, but just think about it, it's all in your mind, you can either feel sad, or you accept how you feel and then see where you could get from there. To me making my bed makes me happy you know? It shows me that I can legit do anything, then i get sad, because I could do anything, and then I realise that my mind is playing me again. It's telling you, that somewhere in you lies the answer you seek. Being ""happy"" is accepting yourself, most people don't get that."

Our skin cells ""regrow"" roughly every 7 days. While this won't make the memory go away, please don't feel impure. Who would even tell you  that you have to feel this way? You don't have to feel defiled because of your abusive brother... he was, attracted to you somehow you know?
He should still have his hands and genitals cut off for doing this to you, but that's just the anger and fear speaking out of me... accept your feelings, accept what happened and maybe someday, you won't have to live with this terrifying past anymore, maybe you can look back and say, ""well, that sucked, but where am I now? He's not here, this will never happen again, and even if it would, I now know better."" 
I'm happy that you had the courage to talk about it and i can't imagine your frustration when your parents told you it was a dream...
Don't surpress your feelings, i can tell you that from my experience, at first it seems to work but your unconscious won't rest.
Maybe expressing your emotions more would do wonders for you, i.e drawing, writing a diary, talking about it, like it happened to someone you know...

Cut your nails and wash your hands obviously, make yourselfs as comfortable as you can be, don't even think about trying to make her orgasm and she shouldn't think about reaching climax either. It's not a race or something. You go roughly 2/3 of your finger in then rub the top stop rythmic and slowly, continuity over intensity with women. And while you do that you also take of other sensual areas if possible. Clit and g spot should work good.

A hint that I hear often to this topic is, that they probably need professional help, so you can help the person, by making her realise, without being direct or cornering her or any of that, that that's what she should want. Step 1 is her becoming aware of it. And remember. You can't change people you can only change yourself and even that, should be done with a tutor or professional since we tend to spin in circles, if we are left by ourself.

JUSTNOFAMILY,eyl84oh,t3_cxhpvc,1567178438.0,"I feel the strongest of empathy for you my friend. I really feel sad about that too and there is some advice I received i'd like to give you. You can't change other people, you can only change yourself. And now you have to listen deep deep down within yourself. I know they are your family and we all grow up knowing that family ""should"" be above all but that's not 1 planck length true. If you suffer like I can not imagine but want to think I can, then I suggest going a bit radical. Because where is the point in suffering any longer. be honest and don't worry about their opinions about you, but don't forcefully shove the thought's in the background, repression is never the answer. They make you feel bad to feel better about their poor lifes, because in monkey language, if you can bully someone, you are strong. So either you show clear boundaries which should not be crossed or you get even more drastic and just cut the strings. Saying sorry that you didn't stand up for yourself is just music to them, allowing them to still feel above you. I know you might be sad for what happened to your sisters because of your mom but everyone makes their own decisions in the end and their coping mechanism are clearly shit. Because they make you, their brother, feel bad. WTF. Do yourself a favour and try to listen to what seems most natural to you and abandon all the selfmade fear, not fear in general, fear is your best friend, it shows you, that things have to change, that they are not fine. So don't ignore it. I hope this in someway can help you. And don't beat yourself up over mistakes, nobody has any clue what they are doing, but your family is obviously horseshit.
