FemaleDatingStrategy,fqzqrrf,t1_fq4wb07,1589773186.0,"2 things that helped me so much.

1) you dont attract toxic people, you just let them stay. (That was an empowering realization because it means im not the broken one. Im not a magnet. It's a choice and i have power over that.)

2) focus on how they make you feel. (I was just blinded by the fact that someone wanted me and the fear i wouldnt find someone else. I didnt pay any attention to how i felt. I didnt check in with myself and was completely out of tune with my emotions. My body could be screaming ""this is awful!!"" And id be like, ""nahh its kind of nice! This could work!"" So Close all the tabs in your mind except the one about how you feel, in your body your heart and your mind, when youre with and without them. If theres anxiety, fear, dread, disappointment etc... just negative emotion, refer to #1. Dont let them stay. Just really take the time to check in with yourself. Do i actually like them? Sometimes feeling like you need someone feels like you like them, so its important to train yourself to know your feelings better and listen to them.)"

Two things are for sure: you are convinced they will change. And they most certainly will not.

They'll do whatever it takes for however long it takes to convince you they have changed, and then little by little, or before you know it, you'll be right back where you were, feeling abused and terrified.

I've come out of it for the most part. With tiny, tiny baby steps. But it'll get you there. Tiny tiny bits of grounding here and there, until it's bigger bits and everyday, until its an automatic response... steps toward self care, taking responsibility for putting yourself in the best environment you can with the least toxicity possible, constantly reassuring yourself you are Ok and safe and love, doing things good for you, exercising and (this was the hardest for me) forcing yourself to keep trying to connect with people in healthy ways.

CPTSD,fhd6zd0,t3_f29xs2,1581478674.0,"I had fainting spells and what looked like seizures (passing out and twitching uncontrollably) quite regularly when I was a teenager. It happened suddenly in public places. The park, the subway, restaurants, the street. Sometimes pissing myself. I never understood why, and after I moved out of home it only happened once in 5 years. 

Looking back on it I wonder if I was constantly dissociating and the extreme amounts of stress and misery would occasionally break through, like a cortisol tsunami my brain couldn't handle so it initiated emergency shutdown mode.

Interestingly enough, there are 4 or 5 times that I can say for sure there was a specific trigger, though I don't understand it. It was a facial expression whoever I was with those times made. Same face different people. It's like a questioning face of concern? Idek how to describe it. Immediately after seeing it I would black out and twitch around for a bit then wake up in a cold sweat and not feel real for the rest of the day.

For example when a doctor saw my massive self harm scars all around my ankles, she looked at me like that. I panicked and blacked out. Another time, i was trying to play a joke on a friend and they didnt really understand so they looked at me with the same face. Blackout. It doesnt make sense, these scenarios have nothing in common except the face. Idk what thats about. 

I dont like thinking about it. Im glad its over with. But its still to this day a huge fear of mine that i will pass out and freak everyone out if I get overwhelmed."

He was right! I was the monster all along! Or, i'm turning into him! I'll never be a good person!

abusiverelationships,ffb8q4s,t3_esml2w,1579755276.0,"The book im reading about abusive relationships explains that the abuser plays on the victim's desire to help or fix or their empathy in general. It says that they build this intense attachment from you from the very beggining by emphasizing a whole victim persona, ""i was abused as a kid"", ""life has been rough and unfair"", ""my ex was extremely hurtful."" Etc etc. It pulls you in, makes you want to be there for them,and they know it and they play that card hard- and this is what I see in this message. He is telling you to leave in such a way that makes it impossible for you to do so, because he's pushing on the very thing that keeps you attached. He knows how easy it is to get you to feel bad for him and he's using it against you to keep you while making it seem like he's just a poor soul with no hope trying to spare the people he cares about. I just hope you see through his tactics and know he is not saying this out of any real concern or respect or love for you. It is a tactic... he may be aware of what he's doing, but don't kid yourself, he is not aware and/ or doesnt actually care that it really hurts you. i've lived through it myself and reading this book after i left him finally is painfully eye opening. Like i knew it was bad, enough to make me leave, yet i keep learning in retrospect how bad it really was, worse than i even realized.
You absolutely deserve to be respected and loved. You absolutely deserve a healthy relationship. You absolutely deserve to do right by yourself, and yoh have a duty to take care of yourself.

You need to vent. For sure. We all need to vent. But not to your abuser... i personally dont believe any good can come from that, but certainly a lot of bad can. Try burning what you wrote if it's on paper and burying the ashes. I've never tried but i hear that can feel pretty cathartic."
