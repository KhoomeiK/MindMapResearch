roosterteeth,f0f5odc,t3_d4doqv,1568578323.0,"I have my top two of all time that I love going back to. I don't really follow the seasons, so I don't know if you've already watched these episodes. They are older, but amazing. 

My top two (that I have watched multiple times), are:

* Ep. 52 - We've Been Deported to Brazil - [https://youtu.be/2Ne9wqJdeps](https://youtu.be/2Ne9wqJdeps)
   * The cast of this episode is gold.  Elyse ,  James, and Bruce from Funhaus; and Zack Anner who is a amazing. They all have an amazing dynamic and work off of eachother.
   * This episode contains some of the best improve jokes I've seen on the show
   * Also, fun thing to look out for, there's a guy in the audience who keeps changing shirts every time they cut back to the audience. There is absolutely no reason for it, but you gotta respect a man like that.
* Ep. 94 - SMASHMOUTH ALLSTARS -  [https://youtu.be/QTYajnG-dOc](https://youtu.be/QTYajnG-dOc)
   * We get *uber* drunk Jeremy (that's always a win). Also I like his dynamic with Miles.
   * This episode is just filled with memorable moments where most people on the show have no idea whats going on
   * Drunk Jeremy

Another two episodes of more recent stuff that I found really funny are both with Chris and Blaine as a duo. These two are from the last two seasons where they chose a theme for each season. One is from the *On the Spot: Lost in Time* and the other is from the most recent season of *On the Spot: The Happy Room.* I don't think you really need context for these seasons, just know that the guests take up characters to do the show. In the themed season, Blaine and Chris were really funny together and usually chose really interesting characters to play together. I don't remember much about these two specific episodes, just that rememberer thinking they were very funny when I first saw them. 

More recent episode suggestions:

* Ep. 157 - Emo Trevor vs. Blaine Bot 3000 - [https://youtu.be/j3O1MBqVn54](https://youtu.be/j3O1MBqVn54)
   *  It has Trevor, Blaine, Chris, and Andy 
      * (RIP Andy Blanchard) (You'll always be in my heart)
   * I love all the cast in this episode. Their characters in this episode are hilarious
* S14 • E8 - Death of a Puppet - [https://youtu.be/Cbwlr2HLV\_w](https://youtu.be/Cbwlr2HLV_w)
   * The guests are Barbara, Blaine, Chris, and Jessica
   * Blaine and Chris really up the ante
   * there's a puppy in this episode, so that bonus

&#x200B;

These are personal recommendations and I can't promise you that you'll like them too. I never watched On the Spot because the episodes were hit or miss for me. I realized after watching random episodes that I really liked the ones with Jeremy in them. I started watching all the past episodes that had him on as a guest, and from there I found other people that I really enjoyed as guests, such as Joel and Zach Anner. I recommend you find a guest you find funny or look up compilation videos of funny moments on On the Spot, those are good ways to know what episodes you might enjoy. 

Hope this helps a bit"
