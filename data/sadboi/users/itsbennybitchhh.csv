I’ve found that I have to have my app open on my phone to track my bike ride properly. I do have my fitbit app set to only access location while using, so that’s probably what that’s about. 
But another thing that annoyed me yesterday was that I forgot to wear my Fitbit when I left to go biking. I had my phone and was trying to track the bike ride but it only tracks walking, running and hiking. So I had to download a free cycling app for the ride. Is there a way to add biking to the tracking page on the app?"
seduction,fqrh1tr,t3_gk5ytv,1589584203.0,"My ex boyfriend is like this. He’s super introverted and can’t hold a conversation via text or in real life. I would always send long messages or ask him questions to try to keep the convo going via text, and he would reply with only a few words and I’d get frustrated and not reply back. Then 30 minutes later he would text again “so how was your day” or “talk to me”, etc. We were on and off for three years. 
If you guys had good chemistry when you were in person then I’d think she just doesn’t like texting. The next time she gives you short answers say “would it be better if we talked on the phone?” and see what her response is. 
If you guys end up going on more dates and her communication with you doesn’t improve to your liking, you could talk to her about it or just move on. It’s much easier to find someone who you feel content communicating with rather than trying to change the communication style of a current partner."

BPD,fq1ebi0,t1_fq1675a,1589044878.0,"You wouldn’t believe the amount of times I’ve heard “I think I have that too!” when bpd comes up in a conversation. I’m really into reading about mental illnesses and never once thought I could’ve had bpd until I was diagnosed 1.5 years ago at 22 years old. From my understanding, it’s not even appropriate for a medical professional to diagnose a person with bpd until they are over 18. Being mentally ill is romanticized by teenagers now. That’s just how it is.  
If you’re a teenager, seek out a therapist that can help you with what you’re going through. I was hospitalized twice in my late teens for what I see now as obvious bpd traits, but at the time I was just told I was severely depressed and I accepted that. 
And to comment on the empath thing, I always say I can feel the “vibes” coming off of people, but I don’t consider myself an empath. I feel an enormous amount of empathy for animals, but very little for humans. I’ve learned to portray appropriate responses when I need to though lol"

I can’t stand when people act entitled to everything and feel the need to put down a business to make themselves feel better.

I got this job through a nanny agency, so the contract should’ve been perfect. But for some reason, the contract states that I am to be flexible and accommodating to changes in schedule. So this family pays me to be available three days a week(27 hours). But if they randomly decide they want to switch me to a different day for the week I have to accommodate, therefore I can’t have a second job... I also don’t get paid sick days. It’s pretty unfair. If they want a nanny to be available to them Monday through Friday, then technically they would have to pay me for 40 hours a week. Having a nanny is a luxury and if you can’t afford it, then you have daycare as another option. There’s a lot about this position that makes me unhappy, that’s why I’m bitter about the idea of having to work if one of the parents were off work lol"

If it were the mom not working and being home all day I’d be fine with that because we have built up a relationship.

childfree,fo6jf79,t1_fo5mjbk,1587560307.0,"The job would actually change a lot and become harder lol the kids don’t listen to the dad. So it would change the whole dynamic of the work environment. It’s also uncomfortable to have to spend 8 hours with a man you don’t really know. A lot of nannies refuse to work for stay at home parents, no matter how high the pay. So when the parents are working from home or just staying home without work, it’s not the job the nanny signed up for. I wish I could find a analogy to help explain it. The best I can think of that still involves kids would be if you worked at a daycare and the parents were allowed to come spend the whole day there with the kids. It would just be chaos lol"
childfree,fo6igdk,t1_fo5z6b5,1587559628.0,The dad being home and around me and the kids would change the whole dynamic. It would make it impossible for me to do my job properly.

So it would just be uncomfortable for me to have to be around the dad all day. I’ve seen a lot of nannies putting in their notice due to the fact that parents are now working from home. They say it’s just not what they signed up for. But I think if the dad were to have to stay home that he would just hide in his bedroom anyways lol

Nannying is a job like any other. If you were running a business and you didn’t want your employees coming in to work potentially carrying the virus then you would shut down your company temporarily. My boss is just going to have to work with what I’m giving her. I’m the only form of childcare she has. So if she wants to fire me for going grocery shopping then go ahead.

She’ll leave all non perishable groceries sitting outside too when she gets a delivery. 

I live in a duplex and my sister and her bf live on the other half of it, so I see them daily. 
I put a glove on to pump gas(because the gas station is the only place I go) and sanitize and wash my hands constantly. On Saturday I went to Walmart with gloves and a respirator on so that I could get some groceries. My boss has said she would order my groceries for me but I just don’t really care to do that. She also wants me to bring my laundry and do it at work instead of going to the laundromat. I have almost no clean clothes at this point because it’s just way too hard to do laundry while caring for 3 kids under 5. 

I told her about everyone wearing masks in Walmart and she went in her office and came out a bit later and was like “yeah don’t go to anymore stores please. Me and my mom are freaking out that you were in public. I don’t leave the house at all. I feel like nothing I’m doing matters if you’re still going out”. Meanwhile her husband works in downtown Pittsburgh M-F. I also live in the same duplex as my sister and her bf. So I hang out with them almost daily and her bf works 50 hours a week at Home Depot. Me going to Walmart with PPE on to get essentials should be the least of her concerns.

I’m taking the pandemic very seriously, but I don’t feel comfortable having her tell me what I can and can’t do outside of work. It’s not like I’m hanging out with friends or going out trying to shop for fun. I’m not being paid any extra for working during the pandemic and changing my lifestyle for her. Am I overreacting?

He told me on the second day we hung out that he wouldn’t have a relationship with anyone he couldn’t have sex with first and that if I needed a title to have sex with him that he would be my boyfriend right then and there. Very manipulative. And I didn’t notice the red flags because I was so into him. We spent every weekend together for two months. He even took me in a trip 10 hours from home to stay a long weekend. He would ask me all the time how I felt about him and he would have me pour my heart out and would reply “ugh I’m just not there yet. You’re further ahead in your feelings than I am”. He wouldn’t allow me to talk to or hang out with other guys. He saw that as me being shady and untrustworthy, even though we weren’t in a relationship and he didn’t want to be. We ended things with him telling me “I knew a while ago I didn’t want you as my girlfriend”. But he wanted to have sex so he led me on as long as he could.

You absolutely should have to spend an extensive amount of time around children before deciding whether you want your own or not. I love the kids I nanny. I think they’re funny and cute and I definitely see how you could love having your own(I love 2 out of 3 of the children I currently nanny lol) But since they’re not my own I can logically weigh the pros and cons. My bosses work their own jobs and then come home and do MY job until the kids go to bed. And then the mom gets up in the middle of the night to feed the baby.

childfree,fks8cks,t1_fkrqdrs,1584484440.0,Yeah I’d definitely “disappear”. Block him  and his entire family and go off to live your life the way you want. Children are born every day into bad homes. There’s only so much you can do. Just pretend this is his kid with some other woman and that you have no control over how he wants to raise the child. Maybe you can sign away your parental rights? Then take off and anything that happens will be on him.
CoronavirusUS,fki4kjf,t3_fiicte,1584211804.0,"I live in Pennsylvania. My best friend is currently in the UK on vacation and is planning on staying there until it’s safe to come home. She says she’s scared and that it’s about to get really bad. I’m kinda in denial though. There are no physical signs around  me that something is wrong. I don’t know what I’m waiting to see(my mind is thinking zombie movie shit). I see the numbers and the articles and the shut downs, etc. But I’m under the impression this is due to the media freaking the country out. My parents think this is a joke as well, therefore I’m not sure how to feel or what to do. My local stores are out of toilet paper, hand sanitizer, even meat. I’m not trying to be ignorant. My brain just can’t even grasp the reality of this right now."
VetTech,fjsb7yh,t3_fepk80,1583595323.0,People make me sick. Why even get a pet if you’re going to treat it this way? It’s like they go on some kind of power trip from having control over a helpless animal.
Rabbits,fjeh6zs,t1_fjeh3n0,1583271589.0,Wow. That’s insane. Is he old?
Rabbits,fjcvjqo,t1_fjcuzdb,1583238209.0,"Wow that’s nice. I’m in Pennsylvania and rabbits are considered exotic pets and need to see a special vet. I don’t know if that’s throughout the whole US or not. So usually I expect to pay more regardless. It’s probably going to be $50 just to be seen. But it is what it is. 

Did you have to sanitize the whole living space? I put their wooden hidey houses in black garbage bags and made sure they were air tight. I read this will kill anything living on the wood. 

I also rubbed coconut oil in their ears last night. I don’t know if this is okay to do, it sounded soothing though lol if their ears were just dry from the wood or from sawdust or something I figured that would help. This morning they aren’t touching or shaking their ears at all. So I don’t know what’s going on"
Rabbits,fjbwz5k,t1_fjbu341,1583203272.0,Okay I’ll look into this. I’ve been with them for a couple hours this evening and neither of them are shaking their heads around now. My vet appointment is on Thursday. So I’m going to see how they act these next couple days.
Rabbits,fjbwt7w,t1_fjbhgbv,1583203167.0,I did look in both of their ears and they’re clear. Hair and wax free.
Rabbits,fjb9cos,t1_fjb96k1,1583189097.0,Okay will do. I figured that was the only option anyways. These rabbits are costing me an arm and a leg. I had them at the vet a month ago and ended up with a $300 bill.
Rabbits,fjb8vyp,t3_fckf68,1583188828.0,"My stepdad and I built each of my rabbits a wooden hidey house yesterday. I bought wood from Lowe’s, and he pulled one piece out of his shed. The wood was clean and dry, no sign of an infestation. The rabbits are unbonded and live on separate floors. Today they are both doing this! So I’m assuming the wood was infested. 

I made an appointment with their vet. But is there a home remedy since I caught it so early? My moms friend(who’s a dog groomer) said to drop olive oil in their ears to drown the mites. But that doesn’t sound okay lol"
BPD,fj5v1is,t3_fbinu1,1583044151.0,I talk about this to my therapist all of the time. She says you just have to practice mindfulness. Live in the moment that you have and stop thinking about what’s coming next. I feel like when I have a house my life will start or when I’m married my life will start or when I make more money my life will start etc. But my life is now. Working towards those future things is a part of my story and my existence. I still feel terrified that before I know it I’ll be 70 and I’ve wasted all of my time waiting for something to happen that never did
Rabbits,fj2j966,t1_fj1fnna,1582945093.0,Yes!
Rabbits,fj18ktu,t1_fj14ja7,1582914929.0,This was perfect thank you! I have two Holland lops. When I’m home on the weekends I see that they nap from like 10am-4pm. Which is crazy.
Rabbits,fj0tfr1,t1_fizttcp,1582907382.0,"I have thought since I got the one that she might be deaf. Her name is Janet. I will walk into the bathroom and she’ll be in her littler box and I’ll keep saying “Janet. Janet!? I’ve been yelling for you can you hear me?” And she’ll see me and take off running and fling litter everywhere. Then she realizes it’s me and comes to me for pets or food. The vet who spayed her said she wasn’t deaf, but I suppose he could’ve been wrong. When there’s a really loud noise she startles but I know they are sensitive to vibrations as well, so she may be feeling it instead of hearing it. You can message me if this sounds similar to your bun."
Rabbits,fj0dl2d,t1_fiztj8q,1582897288.0,"Thank you! My rabbits aren’t bonded. So one lives on my second floor and one lives on my first floor. Maybe once a week I’ll wake up to the one upstairs zooming around at 5am. I just figured this would be a more frequent thing. 

They each have a plate they eat on. But I will start hand feeding them dinner. 

Have you clicker trained your rabbits? I’ve heard about clicking training rabbits a few times and would love to try it. I’ve clicker trained a dog in the past."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fiziuag,t1_fizgvv2,1582864006.0,"Yeah it’s kinda messed up. It may be someone who bought an iguana because it looked cool, but they don’t actually know anything about it. So it’s going to end up 5 feet long and make everyone’s lives miserable lol"
Rabbits,fizipg5,t1_fizhxpx,1582863901.0,"Thank you. I’ve done a ton of research so I know that they’re instincts to protect themselves from predators will always be there. The internet just makes it seem like my rabbits should be super comfortable with my presence. 

I will try to spend more time laying on the floor with them. I just start to feel discouraged because I try to do everything I can to make sure they’re happy and healthy, but they don’t always act happy. They almost never run or binky. Maybe they’re just lazy."
AnimalsBeingJerks,fizg7nc,t1_fizd5hk,1582862002.0,I’ve heard of people needing stitches from getting tail whipped by big iguanas. Those things are mean as hell.
veloster,fiy3e0o,t1_fiw50rm,1582831706.0,Okay thanks for the info! I just bought one in white. I wanted the thunder grey but they could only find white manual transmissions within 3 hours of me. So I’d love to look into repainting in the future
BPD,fisix04,t1_fis85mf,1582685704.0,Yes!! I have to ask my therapist and my best friend if they’re doing something wrong or if I’m freaking out for no reason. I’m really never sure.
veloster,firbh5s,t3_ez1iip,1582661169.0,"I just bought a 2020 2.0 yesterday! I get to pick it up on Thursday. I had to have a manual transmission. They only found one within 2 hours of me and it’s white. I wanted thunder grey, but it’s not a huge deal. This was also my first grown up new car buy, so I couldn’t afford anything above the 2.0. It’s a start though. If I like the car I could always trade it in for a different model in the future."
veloster,fir9aj5,t3_f2gj98,1582659930.0,Do a lot of you guys have Velosters that you’ve repainted? If so how much does something like that cost?
dating_advice,fiov3xz,t3_f8uh1g,1582591694.0,"I had this happen to me last summer. I thought this guy was my soulmate. He even took me on a trip 10 hours from home for 3 days. Then he decided he didn’t want anything serious and never did and it was my fault for thinking it was going anywhere serious, even though all of his behavior and words pointed to a relationship"
veloster,fil0veu,t1_fijbkhp,1582491256.0,"Thank you for your advice! I’ve been looking for a turbo with a manual engine, preferably less than $15,000. I’m having a terrible time finding one. The best deals are over 2 hours from me in any direction. So it’s looking like I might have to travel to buy the car once I find the right one."
childfree,fiimcta,t1_fif7ixr,1582423264.0,Oh I think I replied to the wrong thing lol whoops
childfree,fieqda2,t1_ficsb23,1582381521.0,She didn’t have anything removed. She only had her tubes tied. It was a very routine procedure with minimal recovery time
childfree,ficqlzz,t1_ficcmhz,1582354370.0,My best friend just had this done this year at 25 years old. She’s beyond happy about it.
Rabbits,fib1jt4,t3_f7cbg4,1582312722.0,I want my rabbits to experience the snow but I think they’ll hate it. They are no fun
veloster,fib0epg,t1_fiaorw1,1582312056.0,Do the turbos take regular gas like most cars? Or do you have to put more expensive gas in them? My mom is also saying it’s going to burn through gas because it’s a turbo. Is this true? I don’t think she actually knows lol
VetTech,fiafe02,t3_f3kznb,1582299900.0,"If anyone sees this, I wanted to let you all know that I was able to just text pictures to the vets office and she said my buns ear just healed that way and there’s no way to repair it other than surgery. The shape of the ear won’t lead to any complications over her lifetime, so we are just leaving it be."
BPD,fiaeyvh,t3_f789p8,1582299649.0,"Me and my middle school best friend had to go to the school counselor in 8th grade because she started recording and editing videos like I did and I wasn’t having it lol it turned into a huge argument. 

Now I internalize things so I don’t look crazy. When my therapist tries to tell me that a lot of people do x, y and z and that I’m not crazy, it annoys me. I want her to be shocked that I act in certain ways so that I can feel like a rare patient lmao"
VetTech,fhzdklm,t1_fhyhpo3,1581996764.0,I was able to send them pictures and the vet said sometimes things just heal wrong. She said the only way to repair it now would be surgery. And I’m not going to put her through that for cosmetic purposes.
Rabbits,fhlvlpu,t1_fhkc5f1,1581705289.0,"They got in a huge five shortly after I took this video. And then two days later one broke through a cage while I was at work and they were fighting when I got home. I had to take the one to the emergency vet because she had a huge tear through her ear. So now they are living on separate floors of my house for 2-3 months, then I’ll try bonding again. It’s so frustrating. 

In your case, try cutting the date off right before they would normally start fighting. And keep doing it like that and maybe gradually add an extra minute every two days or something."
VetTech,fhkdu87,t1_fhk0tl9,1581679591.0,"Yes they sent home an oral pain medication for both of my buns and a topical cream to prevent infection of their wounds. My other bun only had minor scratches, but I treated them both as the vet recommended. I gave the rabbit pictured some of the left over oral pain medication last night because she still acts like her ear hurts very bad. I also was pointing the cream on her ear up until last night"
autism,fhjmjl3,t1_fhj7g6x,1581649908.0,I’m not on the spectrum and I do this as well. I start at the top of my liked songs on Spotify and listen down the list about 5-10 songs and then start from the top again. The predictability is nice and I’m really into those songs right now so I’m not sick of them yet! As I add more songs to the list the others get moved down further and I end up phasing them out.
VetTech,fhjm4xw,t1_fhjjaon,1581649620.0,"This happened February 1st. Yeah I thought $300 was a good deal too, I just wasn’t sure if I should be appalled by how this turned out or not lol 

No, no surgery was offered as it didn’t need it at the time. It was a tear through the ear, and all of the skin was touching. There was still a hole if you pulled the wound apart. But it’s like the glue didn’t heal the wound back together, just healed the borders. I have a big scab that came out from the center"
VetTech,fhjir1q,t1_fhjhyj8,1581647220.0,"Yes bunny skin is “paper thin” they say. I wish I could post pictures of the initial wound. I don’t know how to use Reddit that well yet. 

And I got accepted into the vet tech institute. I’m supposed to start this July but unless I get a lot of financial aid I may not. It’s crazy expensive and there are no other vet tech program near me. What type of program are you doing? If you don’t mind me asking."
iamatotalpieceofshit,fhjhgq3,t1_fhhtwu5,1581646317.0,If your dad cuts your hair without your consent can’t you report that as assault? It’s your body. I’d definitely keep that in mind if he were to cut it off while you’re sleeping.
VetTech,fhjgzqb,t3_f3kznb,1581645976.0,"Hi Vet Techs! I’m not looking for medical advice, as I’ll be calling the vet in the AM. 

Long story short, I’m bonding my two rabbits. It has not been going well and one of them got her ear ripped clear through. I am working with shelters and various online forums to deal with the bonding, so no need to comment on that(it’s been rough). 

I rushed both buns to my nearest emergency clinic(or it used to be but they’ve just recently shut down their ER). They still agreed to take both buns in to be seen by their exotic vet since I walked in thinking it was the ER. 

They said they tried stapling the ear together without success so they went with glue. The scab just came out an hour ago and look at my poor bun’s ear! They told me there would be a scar but I’m assuming this is not what was intended. 

So wtf happened? Do I have a right to be upset with the clinic and ask for at least a bit of a refund? I paid $300 for the visit. I’m also guessing there’s no way to further repair the ear without surgery since it healed like that, and if it’s not necessary I won’t put my bun through that. 

I just though I’d share with you guys."
