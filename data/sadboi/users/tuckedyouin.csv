BipolarReddit,fqdzg45,t3_gi5994,1589299235.0,How often do you have cravings? I’ve stopped in the past but never gotten to a point where I don’t want it anymore.  Does that ever happen?
Flooring,fpslzln,t3_gfb123,1588875726.0,Yeah you’ll have to undercut that moulding more to squeeze the flooring under there - only other option is to scribe the pattern onto the flooring and use a jigsaw to match as close as possible and then caulk the seam
Flooring,fprob74,t3_gf6dq1,1588858777.0,"I would recommend against this, as floors designed to float run into issues as soon as they aren’t able to expand and contract with temperature and humidity changes"
HomeImprovement,folobpr,t1_foll073,1587866658.0,Yeah I think that would work perfectly!
HomeImprovement,folkrxl,t3_g830he,1587864368.0,"Definitely fixable if you or someone you know knows how to lay brick. Just chisel out any that may have cracked through and replace. Then build it up so it’s level and chisel the top half to be level too, then it just takes a layer of mortar to put the top half back on the bottom half."

Flooring,fmysddm,t3_fy8ilr,1586494332.0,Is this a design that comes on the tile or is it hand painted?
Flooring,fkeclyg,t1_fkcs8rw,1584110342.0,"If  they are splitting due to humidity, chances are they weren’t installed correctly and don’t have enough of an expansion gap at the walls. This causes the wood to swell and since it has nowhere to go it usually tries to go up causing the boards to split. Usually your first response would be to try to fix the lay of the floor, and if that doesn’t work you can use a flexible seal. Just remember if the wood swelled up, it’ll shrink back down. So if you fill all your gaps when it’s big, it’ll look strange when it’s small if that makes sense ."
Flooring,fkcro6m,t3_fhazje,1584059600.0,"Awesome, looks nice!"
Flooring,fkcqbj1,t3_fhqijy,1584058718.0,"I’d recommend taking a scrap piece and going to a flooring store or Home Depot and using that to find a match. Color runs can vary even with the same flooring depending on how long ago that batch was purchased. Try to match what you can now just using your eyes as opposed to finding the exact brand and color (obviously this won’t apply if you are planning on filling large areas, but for small fills it will work just fine."

Flooring,fkblhhz,t3_fhazje,1584035199.0,Is this grouted? Joints looks a bit close for click n lock
Flooring,fjouxgx,t3_fel108,1583535294.0,"Since it’s on the wall it would be easy to just pull up and replace if you can find the same flooring. Another option would be to drill a small hole in a few spots, fill under with liquid nails and use something to weight it down. Then just fill the holes with a wood filler that matches the floors."

Tools,fg02eh2,t3_ew3oji,1580398702.0,What makes these preferred by doctors and therapists? Do they use screwdrivers often?
landscaping,ffgrubf,t3_etfqpw,1579913448.0,"Looks like dirt daubbers like others have said, just keep an eye out for their nests elsewhere. We had some nest in our RV furnace exhaust last year and had to replace the entire furnace. Good to have around, but keep them where you want them."
Flooring,fefpfl6,t3_eov2x8,1579061520.0,"If it is a floating floor, do not glue it down it will void any warranty that comes with the flooring. A floating floor needs to be able to expand and contract, and glueing it could cause for splits between boards."
