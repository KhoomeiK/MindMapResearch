AmItheAsshole,fqm56a2,t1_fqlxeuf,1589471690.0,"The thing is she's not doing anything to support their relationship. In fact, it seems like she's actively trying to destroy it. Stay at home moms and dads actually take care of the house and the children but this girl is doing nothing. The comment was insensitive, I'll admit, but it was justifiable. This girl embarrassed OP in front of his boss after he had begged her not to and didn't even apologize when confronted, instead acting spoiled and entitled to the place she wasn't even doing anything for. And I don't think asking their girlfriend to back off and let them work is comparable to using the house as leverage against her. It's a reasonable request backed up with facts, if said in an inconsiderate manner. I'm going NTA."

I'd love a bit more development for him but it's kind of a nice change from the 'relatable' and 'interesting' (read: tragic) characters if I'm being honest. Well, to each their own, I guess."
SelfAwarewolves,fptmbp5,t1_fptej0b,1588893944.0,"Fair point, but if the country reopens at this rate then COVID deaths will rise to about 3000 daily, also according to the Washington Post ([article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/05/04/coronavirus-update-us/)). We're stuck between a rock and a hard place. This situation could have been softened, if not prevented entirely, with immediate action. 

As for the Redditors, some may be misinformed but quite a few of them aren't. They may be biased which is a problem, but I think they have points. Increasing the minimum wage would be better for the millions in poverty. I understand that it could have adverse effects on our economy, though. I'm not sure what they are, I'm kind of an idiot, but it's a point. I'm kind of confused about the point that you made about other countries not having access to university programs. As far as I know, they do have access to a good education including university."
PoliticalHumor,fptcnwq,t1_fpt90ae,1588888832.0,"You're right, but it does something. And I assume that something is better than nothing. And as for the people with pre-existing health issues, I would argue that they shouldn't even be out there, they're part of the at-risk-of-death group. And also, masks provide a safer feeling which is something that is in short supply nowadays and seeing someone without one can take away that feeling."
SelfAwarewolves,fptbrgd,t1_fptb6fs,1588888367.0,"Sorry if I made that unclear, the person you were responding to was talking about COVID so I assumed you would follow that train of thought, but to be fair, they were talking about a lot of other things as well. Also to be fair, how well we handled the crisis depends on what you're measuring by. I was measuring by people dead and such but you're measuring by the economy. You're right, we can probably bounce back economically but at the cost of thousands of more lives. It depends on what you prioritize, I guess."
SelfAwarewolves,fpt0vqn,t1_fprd2z5,1588882932.0,"American here! We handled the crisis like shit. Now, I know that not all of us can understand our failings but keep working on it buddy!

Most of them have been screwed over by the government. They didn't get their stimulus checks so they can barely live. For them, it's either corona or starvation. In all honesty, I can't blame most of them, but the ones protesting for useless reasons are selfish entitled pieces of garbage and represent most of what's wrong with this world."

feemagers,foupp8s,t3_g9czm2,1588088333.0,"I understand what you're going through. I was like that, just a few months ago. I know it's a break and relief from the pain and whatever else is in your head, but it does other things to you. I never noticed it, but my friends did. They told me that they could see me deteriorate and they didn't know why. Self-harm is like a parasite. It feeds off of your negative emotions and destroys you. Every person is different, so they find different ways to cope, but I would suggest talking to someone you trust. What worked for me was slowly, gently, easing myself out of it. Different levels of pain. Instead of cutting, snapping a rubber band around my wrist. Then gently pinching myself, then, eventually, I didn't need to do it anymore. It's going to be an uphill battle if you decide to stop. It is, ultimately, your decision but I strongly suggest you ease yourself out of it. In the long run, it doesn't help at all. It just breaks you down further. Good luck on your healing journey and I wish you happiness and peace ❤️"
