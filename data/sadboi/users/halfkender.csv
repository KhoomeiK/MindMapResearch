Epilepsy,fmvvpli,t3_fxod8c,1586432536.0,"Hi there

Thanks for joining our community.  I hope we can help you feel the support you need.

Just a bit of my own history, I have had epilepsy for 30+ years.

I was diagnosed with epilepsy at 16 I am now in my 40s. When I was first diagnosed, I had multiple seizures every day. Really bad painful seizures until I was put on good medication. I almost didn't graduate high school because of my seizures. I came to the realization during my senior year to let either epilepsy define me or let me define me. I fought back and I graduated top of my class. I then went to University and did some graduate work all while having epilepsy.

I have lived in Japan and the Philippines. I speak both Japanese and Tagalog. I have snorkelled in the middle of the ocean over coral reefs off the coast of Boracay all while having epilepsy. I have been with amazingly beautiful women because I was confident and didn't let epilepsy hold me back. Yes, a few knew I had epilepsy and it was not a deal breaker.

I raised a young man as a single parent that turned into an awesome well rounded adult. I did that all while having epilepsy. He has seen me have seizures and knew exactly what to do in an emergency. He saved my life when I went into status in my living room (40 minute seizure). I worked for two fortune 500 companies, travelled the world for work and yes I still have epilepsy.

Be the hero in your story. Don't let epilepsy define you, you define you.

Epilepsy,fkj1jv8,t3_fieb70,1584233839.0,"Adults with epilepsy may be eligible for Social Security benefits (when you put in your application, you automatically apply for both SSDI and SSI). The Social Security Administration (SSA) evaluates epilepsy according to the type, frequency, duration, and nature of the seizures. Because epilepsy isnâ€™t necessarily disabling if itâ€™s well-controlled, you will need to prove that your epilepsy interferes with your daily activities even though youâ€™ve taken anticonvulsant medications as prescribed for at least three months. Youâ€™ll also need to show that any alcohol or drug use isnâ€™t contributing to your medicationâ€™s lack of effectiveness.

When you file for benefits, a claims examiner, and sometimes a medical consultant, will be assigned to review the evidence and determine if youâ€™re eligible for benefits. They will be looking for the following items in your records:

- a diagnosis of epilepsy

- a detailed description of your typical seizure, including all pre- and post-seizure symptoms

- a statement from your doctor corroborating your account of the nature and frequency of your seizures

- a description of your seizures from a third-party witness

- a record indicating the frequency of your past seizures
  results of an EEG

- a detailed treatment history, including medications and other treatments that youâ€™ve tried and your response to them.

Thanks for joining our community.  I hope we can help you feel the support you need.

Just a bit of my own history, I have had epilepsy for 30+ years.

I was diagnosed with epilepsy at 16 I am now in my 40s. When I was first diagnosed, I had multiple seizures every day. Really bad painful seizures until I was put on good medication. I almost didn't graduate high school because of my seizures. I came to the realization during my senior year to let either epilepsy define me or let me define me. I fought back and I graduated top of my class. I then went to University and did some graduate work all while having epilepsy.

I have lived in Japan and the Philippines. I speak both Japanese and Tagalog. I have snorkelled in the middle of the ocean over coral reefs off the coast of Boracay all while having epilepsy. I have been with amazingly beautiful women because I was confident and didn't let epilepsy hold me back. Yes, a few knew I had epilepsy and it was not a deal breaker.

I raised a young man as a single parent that turned into an awesome well rounded adult. I did that all while having epilepsy. He has seen me have seizures and knew exactly what to do in an emergency. He saved my life when I went into status in my living room (40 minute seizure). I worked for two fortune 500 companies, travelled the world for work and yes I still have epilepsy.

Be the hero in your story. Don't let epilepsy define you, you define you.
