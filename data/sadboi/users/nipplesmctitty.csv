bipolar,fqqsqsh,t1_fqp8oun,1589571285.0,Ive been to that place before and it never helped me. Plus disappointment and anger from my parents and all that
bipolar,fno9wkl,t1_fnlwcuq,1587117640.0,It's always different for everyone! I forgot to mention that latuda gave me minor akathesia: the feeling like being stuck in a caged glass box.
bipolar,fnknim4,t3_g29u15,1587033841.0,"Same dude i havent slept right for 2 weeks, but this mania was triggered 3 weeks ago... my heart keeps palpitating and i cant sit still or focus on my homework."
bipolar,fnknf6u,t1_fnkn7a1,1587033737.0,No no don't be sorry! I probably didn't explain it well. I wish men could take bc other than condoms! We're suffering the consequences!!
bipolar,fnkncc0,t1_fnkmzbm,1587033650.0,"Thank you lol

Yeah SSRIs affected me negatively as well. Prozac sent me to the mental hospital..."
bipolar,fnkn674,t3_g29vc5,1587033466.0,"Latuda helped me mentally, but I have since become overweight, broke out, and lost hair. Vraylar also helped me mentally, but gave me terrible akathesia. My whole body was shaking and the restless legs drove me insane."
bipolar,fnkmtuk,t1_fnkmnfi,1587033099.0,"Yeah dude. It's that thought that you will have to take them for the rest of your life. And you have no choice but to do so because otherwise your episodes will get bad, but at the same time that constant cycle of experimenting with one cocktail after another just to find stability drives me insane. One med makes you feel fine, but then you react physically. The others make you feel numb or even worse."
bipolar,fnkmoaz,t3_g2bwdb,1587032935.0,Buspirone 5mg for twice a day worked for me!
bipolar,fnkmkt6,t3_g2cf0p,1587032830.0,Fuck yes. It's exactly that thought that drives me up the wall.
bipolar,fnkmb7k,t1_fnj1enf,1587032538.0,"The symptoms never went away. Like I said I think it triggered my bipolar and I was all over the place! Especially being irritable. Unless I was smoking weed, I was blowing up every second. It made relationships difficult to manage because I would get so angry that I turned delusional and would believe my partners were always cheating. Now that im on bp meds those symptoms are nearly gone, i still get my episodes but im nowhere near as bad as I used to be."
bipolar,fn4m6tm,t1_fn2h339,1586644257.0,Thanks! I hope everything works out for you as well. Its annoying not being heard properly.
bipolar,fn1uq97,t3_fylt9f,1586570568.0,This is amazing
bipolar,fn1u76d,t3_fymem2,1586570208.0,"Yeah it's like this right now with my current symptoms that match ADHD. I am already diagnosed bp maybe my psych doesnt want me to go into mania or psychosis due to stimulants for adhd. Idk, what i did was put my foot down, really. I told her sternly that i mentioned my focusing issues when I first met her and that it was dismissed, but its beginning to damage my grades. Now shes going to do a adhd screening with me next time we meet."
bipolar,fn1sanu,t3_fyoc5a,1586568939.0,Yes. I actually believe it triggered my bipolar when i was 16. Ive been on birth control now on and off for 5 years now and i dont see a difference between my mood cycles and the bc anymore. But when i first started taking bc i was definitely exhibiting the same symptoms as you wrote here.
bipolar,fn1jcss,t3_fyrqyx,1586563239.0,"I understand how you feel. I myself went through this when I was first diagnosed. Ive been hospitilized two times now and ive only been diagnosed in under 2 years. If you feel like a danger to yourself, check yourself in. They will watch you physically and mentally. You will probably also meet some amazing patients (just from my experience). I hope everything works out."

bipolar,fldo6jy,t3_fnuv8p,1585068435.0,"Omg yes. Im good in the day, but when night hits im extremely uneasy and suicidal. Try taking it when youre sleepy, eat a snack, then take your cocktail. That has helped a little."
bipolar,fkzrw4c,t1_fku22yf,1584678571.0,"Yeah definitely a big decision to make, you have to be precarious about everything it seems. I truly hope the best for you and those kids."
bipolar,fku0wt8,t3_fkpm31,1584539741.0,"Hell no you are not the asshole in this situation. I know how you feel, my parents are the same way. My mom is also black and white in thinking and will defend my dad at no costs. Will you be taking the kids in if CPS does take them away? Also if you need an ear, you can DM me. Im sorry this is happening to you, panic attacks are in jo way selfish, youre allowed to have them, but im sorry you keep having them. Best wishes my friend"

Well it’s not my place to tell you which decision to make. I don’t know your situation so I hope whatever happens works out for you. But personally, the crying to me sounds like manipulation - that or I’m just paranoid for you. I truly wish you the very best"
