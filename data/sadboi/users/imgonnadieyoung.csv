I might go low and have a panic attack because of it and not be able to eat or drink because I feel nauseous, or I might think I’m low, test and see that I’m high, and have a panic attack because I want to eat sugar not give more insulin. It’s a rough cycle."
emetophobia,fncgerx,t3_g0xegb,1586836122.0,"Yes, absolutely! Anxiety can also cause you to feel sick even though you most likely won’t get sick. It’s best to try to relax, focus on breathing, and wait it out. I always pick a time at least half an hour later where I can tell myself that I will feel better by then and it usually works!

Anxiety,fncfsfy,t3_g0sx2a,1586835692.0,"I always feel nauseous when I’m anxious. For me it helps to focus on my breathing, more specifically breathing through my mouth and only my mouth because even the slightest smells make the nausea worse. I also go to a safe space, like a bathroom or my room and sip on water and hold onto something cold like an ice-pack or a wet paper towel. I don’t really know why it helps but it helps. In the end I just have to remind myself that if I do throw up it will probably be a one time thing and that I will feel better after. I hope you find a solution that suits you!"

Anxiety is all in your head and I’m not sure if this will help you but it helps me to think of throwing up as ridding your body of the anxiety, now I’m not saying try to purposefully throw up because that’s obviously not good.

I think about this way too often. I personally believe that whatever we think will happen is what will happen or what we will see. I believe that in our last few seconds of brain activity we will experience whatever we have been taught will happen after death or whatever our brains can come up with at the time of our deaths; and after that... nothing. So for example, if a Christian believes that they will see God and go to heaven after death, that’s what they will see, and then everything ceases to exist.
This belief also explains why some people who were pronounced dead for a few seconds or minutes sometimes come back and say what they saw, and how sometimes they don’t match up with what other people saw."

I know it sounds stupid but after a long week of having panic attacks every night I took this weird puzzle book from my mom ( she works in a school) and it had simple puzzles that like 5 year olds could do and some harder ones too. It took my mind off of things and I’m thinking maybe something like that could help you as well or just something for you to do instead of thinking about sleep.

Sure, my anxiety does affect people other than myself, but how can I do anything about how they’re feeling if I can’t even help myself? Moral is, everybody has random panic attacks for what seems like no reason at the time. You are normal and you need to take a moment to stop worrying about what’s going to come and what you have to do later. You may not think there is a reason now but deep down there’s a trigger in there somewhere. It took me years to find my trigger and I still struggle with it today.

2- you can now bring snacks into the movie theatre and not have to hide them 
3- they only kept you for a day?"
diabetes,f25qwcr,t3_dc0p2a,1569981467.0,"I had the same problem. I’ve only had mine for about 3 months now. It kept falling off after only a week so I ordered some band-aid type covers off of amazon. They work great except for the fact that it feels like my skin is being ripped off when I’m taking it off. The band-aid type cover is a circle so I cut it into 3 parts and took the middle rectangular piece and put it over the libre. It’s going smoothly so far and hopefully won’t hurt as much trying to take it off since it’s only a bit bigger than a band-aid. This probably didn’t help much but I’m still learning, I’m so used to just ripping off my other pod in less than a second. I hope you figure it out though and can find a way to make it work!"
