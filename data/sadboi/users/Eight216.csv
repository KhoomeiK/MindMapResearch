The emotional expressions portrayed in the show are accurate and they can often show up very briefly when someone is trying not to show something on their face. It's also true that people have unintentional stress responses when they lie which are commonly known as tells.

&#x200B;

However that starts to break down when you realize that most tells do not reduce to the level of a micro expression because they're things like scratching your nose or tapping your foot or yawning. Furthermore, the even more subtle changes in physiology that someone might display when they lie (as detected by a polygraph) are really only indicators of \*stress\* rather than a certificable way to discover a lie or truth, furthermore a polygraph operator worth their salt will ask multiple variations of the same question just to make sure, because even hooked up to all those wires someone can hear ""did you cheat on your wife"" and think ""oh, no sweat, it was only hand stuff that doesn't count"" but then in the same session they hear ""did you engage in any contact with another woman that you wife would disapprove of"" and start to sweat.

Micro-expressions are simply an emotional response but they're not invisible like the show makes it seem. Most people just don't pay attention or don't know what they're looking at. Which, to be fair, it's pretty easy to not know what you're looking at when you don't know the person you're looking at. It's not some kind of wizardry where you can just look at a persons face and read their mind. Even when you do know someone and know what disgust, fear, anger, etc look like at a seconds glance you're still going to have zero clue enough of the time. Plus, identifying the thing holds no bearing on the \*why\*.  

&#x200B;

TL;DR- Micro expressions are based on emotion and have nothing to do with lying. Most people have a ""tell"" but that doesn't reduce to the level of a micro expression and tells show stress not lies."

If this dude decides it's a deal breaker it's going to be 1000x shitier for everybody now than it would've been if you were upfront about it, or worse if he tries to ignore his preferences and ""make it work"". I'm sure people will tell me how shallow that is and all the same lines but your tastes are what they are and trying to change or ignore them is just going to cause problems."

AskReddit,fmhx1j4,t3_fv7p7n,1586096426.0,"Because reading is a skill that translates into academic activities and the collective sense of judgment doesn't discriminate between reading something, understanding it, and having the critical thinking to critique it. 

When videogames first arrived they didn't have an abundance of content and really only tested the skill of hand-eye coordination. Now you can test hand/eye coordination, reflexes, critical thinking, and just about any other thing depending on the kind of game you're interested in... Which might be part of the problem.

If you disappear into a book, you read it, or possibly the series and then you're done. Even as an obsessive person there's a limit to how deep the rabbit hole goes, without going out of your way to search out new content. In the realm of vidya, though? The rabbit hole can be almost limitless, people spend tens of thousands of hours in games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft (maybe not as much now, but it's still something lurking in the public consciousness) and they can still not even be the best. If you spent 10 thousand hours on a book you would likely be among the foremost leading experts on it, having read it many times and written or read various deconstructions. In some games you can spend 10k hours while still finding new and surprising things you'd never seen before. 

That's great for entertainment purposes, but usually when someone spends too much time on any one hobby, other people start to get worried. 

&#x200B;

TL:DR- To start it was more about the limitations of vidya (pong, pac man, SMB, etc) but now it's about how far the rabbit hole can go (wow, league of legends, skyrim, challange runs, etc) which can lead more easily to an unhealthy level of involvement. Also because reading is tied into school."
