AmItheAsshole,fn8bgcv,t3_fzuf7q,1586737949.0,"NTA - but seems kind of silly to argue over such a small amount of money. That's your sister (guessing younger) and she's probably trying to watch something together with her partner at the same time to close that distance gap. 

Probably only a once in a while thing, makes no difference if his family is loaded or not, this might just be your sister contributing what she can at the moment.  (Even though it's your account) 

Look at it as the universe pushing you to try something new? Maybe read a book, learn an instrument or just check up on friends you haven't spoken to in a while.

Spend some days on a beach in South East Asia, have a gyros in Athens, get pick pocketed in Barcelona, the sky is the limit! 

Just go out and enjoy yourself, you're still young I'm 40 in a few days and I still don't know what I'm going to be when I grow up!

All I know is I'm back at uni, working a job I don't  hate and i am spending quality time with my Mrs and 9 month old son. 

Life gets much better if you make changes and give it a chance. 

I hope you have a wonderful life and inspire others.

AmItheAsshole,fmd1v11,t3_fu4m10,1585957487.0,"My dad's had restaurants and worked in hospitality as far as I can remember. I was about 4 years old and setting tables for banquets, clearing tables at 10 years old and taking orders at 14. I was never paid but my dad always spoilt me and we had some pretty rad times. Queue 15 years down the track and we can't stand working together neither of us listen to the other because we both know best (We are still best friends though).

I plan on teaching my son (9months old) the value of hard work but he won't be forced to be there with me, it will be his choice. If he wants to get paid I'll pay him but I'll educate him on the importance of having a budget and living within your means. This means he will contribute to rent, food, utilities etc... (all this money will be secretly invested so when he is responsible enough he can take a holiday or invest in a home or car or whatever)

Best of luck."
