insanepeoplefacebook,fdf8xph,t1_fdevqe2,1578356065.0,"Academic psychologist here, researching these exact topics. There has yet to be an effective intervention that reduces rapes by focusing on the perpetrator (unfortunately) and the bystander approach interventions also have limited effects. Empowerment self-defense (ESD) training is the only intervention that has reduced rape rates sufficiently and over long periods of time to date (and demonstrated through evidence-based research). ESD has been shown to reduce rates of rape victimization by up to 10% for at least 2 years (longer is yet to be studied) which is pretty substantial. 

I agree that it should not be the victims job to protect herself, and we do need to focus on the root of the problem; toxic masculinity, rape culture, gender ideologies, etc.. HOWEVER. If a house is burning down, you make sure the people inside are safe, and THEN you try to put out the fire. In this sense, ESD training is a promising way to protect people from being sexually assaulted, without the not-so empowering advice like carrying a gun or dressing modestly. Though it is not a solution, it is a good first step to protecting those who may be victims."
