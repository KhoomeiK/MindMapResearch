You probably have some big problems in life, but ultimately you're mentally sick. The feeling you're having can be reversed with drugs.

Getting out of the house and interacting with people is what you need. Otherwise I'd say try antidepressants until you're in a better place then slowly wean off.

For myself quitting cannabis for a few months to a year helped me get over symptoms of chs. If I go back to my old habits it comes back after awhile, but I'm able to enjoy it sparingly. 

Once you've taken your break try to reshape your relationship with cannabis. Don't let it be an everyday occurrence. Use it on special occasion. For myself weekends are fair game. It motivates me to get through the week to do it again. Any side effects I have tend to be minor if I only smoke once or twice a week."

SuicideWatch,fp6lkrv,t3_gbfzam,1588354428.0,"Why is it so difficult to die? Because you are meant to live. I know the mindset of apathy and wanting to give up all too well. Even last night I was fantasizing of my death. Life is inherently a struggle no doubt. But life is also a miracle. It's unfathomable what it took for us to exist and to continue to exist. Even with everything we know about the universe and ourselves there is still far too much information we lack to draw definitive conclusions on the nature of reality. Recognizing this helps me to stop thinking of suicide as an option. 

I also have been to therapy and tried prescription drugs to aid my depression, but it just didn't work. I tried cannabis and drinking which numbed me, but made things worse when I came out of the haze. I tried eating well and exercise. That helped more than the drugs, but I still felt so incredibly empty.

Only when I indulged in philosophy did I feel I was on the right path. Stoicism, Christianity, and Buddhism are what I started with and it has taught me how to live and it taught me I needed to learn how to love. 

I had a realization that I think too much of myself. I've surrounded myself with toys and meaningless experiences and as a result I've pushed community and genuine friendships out of my life. The covid 19 lock downs make it incredibly difficult to socialize now, but I know whats important because I had a total absence people in my life and it crushed me so quickly. I think when we focus on others we can stop focusing on ourselves and our own problems. From a biological perspective I think that's what it's all about. Helping others in order to help ourselves because really we're all in the same boat. We all have a connection to each other that is often forgotten. 

Do you have friends or people you care about in your life, OP? If not, I think that may be the crux of the problem. What do you think?

EDIT: I want to add some interesting videos that support my own experiences in that relationships are the most important aspect of life.
