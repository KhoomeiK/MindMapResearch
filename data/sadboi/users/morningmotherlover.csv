I'm in a service industry so there's no need for materials, but instead there are vague rules of which services are needed to meet a certain demand on a department. Because this question is getting more complex every year, we are trying to infer which sets of demand need which sets of supply (as multiple services are delivered at a time). This is in health care btw. Thank you for your input so far btw."
datascience,fldsjbe,t1_fldrcss,1585070860.0,"You're right. I am not trying to use this to predict the future demand, I am trying to build a tool for business users to input a certain demand and see a matching supply. Demand in my business is quite predictable but not entirely, but due to the sheer size of departments, positions and clients this process is quite time consuming. We would like to automate this process (which is akin to budgeting and usually performed by business controllers, along the lines of what you said) so that we update rules concerning meeting supply with demand that might change over the years.  The stage which you describe where we may be able to determine resources based on production figures is where I am at."

I think my problem is slightly different however. The question I am trying to answer is, what kind of supply do we need to meet certain kinds of demand, where demand is an amount of clients in certain categories and supply is work hours of certain different categories (basically positions). 

You have already helped me phrase my problem a lot more clearly though, thanks!"
