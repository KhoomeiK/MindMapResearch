DID,flstacx,t3_fqy9ay,1585450246.0,Yea haha I always thought I was multiple people even when I was little I would blame what I did on my imaginary friends
BPD,fkb9xks,t1_fkb9onk,1584029021.0,Yea thanks ill try those things also being open about my feeling instead of just getting angry. I appreciate you replying :)
BPD,fkb7wex,t1_fkb7jkh,1584027889.0,"Yea she is she's usually acts pretty stable unless I try to leave her, or if ask why she was gone for so long. I just don't want her to be hurt just because of me yanno"

BPD,fkaw528,t1_fkas9z2,1584020844.0,I was assuming people didn't want the full story I was diagnosed with traits I just needed help with this current situation
BPD,fkalewv,t3_fhbu99,1584012498.0,"First being her boyfriend doesn't make you automatically her fp but if you are she might not want to call you those exact words because it can get toxic idolizing someone like that.

Second sometimes trauma can make you feel sex-repulsed or people especially with bpd haven't figured out their sexually completely so it's nothing to worry about 


Third from my experience ill only leave because I think the other person doesn't love me or if I feel like a burden it's not just a switch of not loving them anymore. Hopefully she will talk to you about those things if she starts to feels like that hehe."
BPD,fkal210,t3_fh1k1r,1584012152.0,I would do anything to get rid of it but also can't imagine a life without feeling like this it feels like it's protecting me in some way telling me I should slowly isolate myself.
schizophrenia,fjkw9wa,t1_fjkqlhd,1583435156.0,"Nope, haven't used drugs or alcohol in a long time"
schizophrenia,fjjtjxl,t1_fjjq1ia,1583411720.0,Usually everyday at random times I would feel individual bugs crawling on me I can see them too which usually leads to me panicking if it gets too real
schizophrenia,fjj4a27,t1_fjj3q8u,1583382954.0,Possibly my PTSD has triggered it maybe idk :/
BPD,fhk3fh9,t1_fhk3dg7,1581665102.0,Yes! Same whenever I write something takes over me and I start writing as if someone is talking to me if that makes sense..

BPD,ffj8llt,t1_ffj83fo,1579993032.0,"That's great! I guess I should work on being more open. Holding things in have only made things worse for me. Also trying to rationalize when I'm about to start splitting.
Thanks this does help. <3"
BPD,fcjqmop,t3_ehi1tr,1577699710.0,Thank you I know people say it's not good to hold grudges but the only reason I'm alive right now is just out of pure spite
BPD,fbxawjz,t3_eewcjn,1577177635.0,Cuz animals are cute and are nice companions some people see the brighter side then others I guess lol
BPD,f8rordg,t1_f8aqh5g,1574746994.0,"Well I think it depends on the situation I hadn't been with my mom very much so I didn't know if she was different from other mom's until I started living with her 

She always seemed perfect in my eyes so maybe I did wish she told me sooner I guess it's more honest with the kid to let them know you aren't perfect. Also, my family doesn't talk about mental illness so she never really opened up to me about it. Though now I realize I wish she did, she never told me until things got toxic and she tried to fix our relationship. 

So I think it's good to be open about what you go through and since the child is going through her own things she won't feel alone :)."
BPD,f8apl14,t3_dzwami,1574405711.0,As a daughter of a mom that has mental illness my mom never really told me about that stuff until I was old enough to understand about mental illness and stuff like 12 or 13 but if you want to be more open with her you could say things like some people need more help then others something simple like that im also Curious what other people have to say about this because im not sure.

BPD,f450vcz,t3_dj9e4v,1571363300.0,G note
BPD,f3omnyk,t3_dhcefc,1571022062.0,In my opinion doing the silent treatment or any form of that is toxic immature and petty people should solve the situation not just show they are mad at you and not solve the problem it triggers me so much since my dad used to do it alot.
BPD,f2fm2mx,t3_dda7zj,1570219665.0,Honestly leave him

BPD,f1nsazq,t1_f1ns3ir,1569624961.0,I've been using it for 4 months I used to used prozac but after I tried to od with it they gave me laxapro idk but I'm just not noticing any differences because the prozac had way more significant stuff then the lexapro.
BPD,f1nmqo4,t1_f1nmdfr,1569620781.0,Huh that's a good point I know sometimes I want to sleep and not wake up but not actually do any to kill myself I remember a therapist calling it something I don't remember what it was but yeah

schizophrenia,esf108u,t1_esf0rvl,1561914501.0,Yeah that makes sense if you don‚Äôt mind me asking are you diagnosed  with schizophrenia or something on the spectrum because I‚Äôm not but they gave it to me.
schizophrenia,esf0bnp,t1_esf0855,1561914018.0,Interesting Did it  suddenly cause psychosis or have you had symptoms like that before?

BPD,eq8mlnl,t1_eq8lpxz,1559869250.0,In your opinion do you think the first or second example is a bpd thing because people have been giving me mixed signals when it comes to believing objects are self aware in a sense.
BPD,eq8ltcx,t1_eq8lok6,1559868601.0,Yea I don't know if specifically my second example is bpd related and thanks you too (:
BPD,eq8l77k,t1_eq8l0xv,1559868084.0,"Maybe so, I have gone through abuse and things like that it may be some kind of coping thing because my sister is like that too (not wanting to hurt her toys/stuffed animals feelings)"
