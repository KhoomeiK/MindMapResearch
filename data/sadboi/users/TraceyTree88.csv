EatCheapAndHealthy,f1cjeds,t1_f1c6j9m,1569358812.0,"I didn't know about the buttermilk so thank you for pointing that out.

I would still say biscoff is a low cal biscuit but it absolutely would depend on individual needs as I would snack on two and call it a day.

If I needed something to fill my belly I go for sweet pickled onions, probably not for everyone's taste but pickled foods generally settle the hunger pangs quickly and with good flavour."
EatCheapAndHealthy,f1bbkkl,t3_d8mp1s,1569330202.0,"Sorry, forgot your snacks question. Lotus Biscoff biscuits are very tasty, low cal and has no dairy in it. I like to do crudites (raw veg) and hummus but if that's boring for you I think most crisps, so long as it's not got some cheesy or other whey powdery seasoning will be suitable for your diet.

My goal, along with vegan diet is to cut fat and gain muscle so I'm trying to not snack on anything but pickles, biscoff and carrots, etc.  Once your taste buds adjust to the new diet and starts to forget processed food you should find that even raw broccoli has a sweetness to it. Seriously, I sound like an a*hole saying that but I occasionally smoke and I can still taste sweetness."
EatCheapAndHealthy,f1bb2ge,t3_d8mp1s,1569329781.0,"Indian food is a great thing to enjoy vegan, also Thai and African. I've not really accrued any recipes from these, I just search for them when it takes my fancy. Google is your friend if you like to do this too. Just plan a day or a week in advance, depending on whether you meal prep, and buy what you'll need for your meals.

Chickpeas (or garbanzo if you know them as that), lentils and peas are great for protein.  All the beans!  Quinoa is nice but I always preferred couscous but I've noticed that the grain is pretty damn expensive in the U.S.

Sweet and red potatoes are a good healthy carb, better than white if you care about that.  However I don't really see any point in cutting out white rice (cheap and plentiful) and pasta."

If you turn up at the funeral, you are showing that you cared about them in some way and that shows respect, surely? What I don't think is respectful is saying that they were great and always brightened up a room when they walk in and how they've earned their wings now that they're dead - it's bullshit and cringey. 

There's guid cunts (good guys), silly cunts (the comedians) and there's fucking cunts (the worst), and everything in between.  Point is; everyone is a cunt and it's usually the faults that made that person great to someone. There's no point in forgetting that and glossing over it."
