BPDmemes,fps2bcu,t1_fprz05m,1588866287.0,Thank you!
BPDmemes,fprxwzs,t3_gf74st,1588864113.0,Forgive the ignorance but what app is this? I've seen it come up a few times now.
BPD,fprog4s,t1_fprnnwy,1588858859.0,Do you ever sometimes go into it being so cynical about the exercises you don't do them properly?
BPD,fprfgfm,t1_fpqwi30,1588852689.0,"Yeah I feel that! Like I'm definitely the type of person to accept that another person if they tell me they're busy. It also doesn't help that I know everyone is home right now so in my head I'm like ""what are you doing?!"" haha"
BPD,fprfb5n,t1_fpqvqqg,1588852572.0,Yeah I haven't been able to access DBT yet. I was on a wait list before COVID. I honestly can't wait to start DBT. I just want to get on with my life.
BPD,fpqf8n5,t1_fpqf390,1588821454.0,It's a real shit show eh? I can't help but obsess over it. I see that they've been online/read my message hit it takes them hours to respond. It tears me up.
dndnext,fnq13td,t3_g36vja,1587155691.0,Mage hand. Hands down. Pun intended.
BPD,fn43jhg,t3_fzf1fn,1586633334.0,Absolutely! I want to learn more!!
ukulele,fn3toru,t1_fn3t22i,1586627707.0,It just has such a nice deep sound. I love it.
BPD,fn3mpld,t3_fz64br,1586623807.0,"This sounds like a page right out of my life.
I wish I had advice to help you get through these feelings and circumstances but I don't. I'm still trial and erroring myself in the relationship department.

Stay strong friend! We'll figure it out someday."
ukulele,fn3mgay,t3_fz6ens,1586623665.0,"Dude this slaps! You have such a nice voice.
I love it when artists can take a song and span it across genres.
You may have just convinved me to buy a baritone ;)"
DnD,fn31v5l,t1_fn31roz,1586610636.0,"Ah shit nevermind. Just realized they're a Triton...

Still a great drawing though!"
DnD,fn31roz,t3_fywq3e,1586610559.0,Awe yah! My party has a sea elf too!
BorderlinePDisorder,fn30ij6,t3_fz0wos,1586609545.0,"Holy shit the ""I consider myself disgusting in a lot of ways (despite bouts of arrogance)"" is me.

Yes I too also seek a lot of validation through romantic or sexually charged gestures.

You're not alone there friend!"
BPD,fn2yveo,t1_fn2v0a1,1586608148.0,"Thanks for your reply. I'm grateful for people like you to assure me that my feelings are valid and to be understood.

I'm feeling much better now."
Illustration,fn2bui5,t1_fn2bcax,1586583751.0,"Haha really? I'm always worried about people being like ""oh a bard who gets the ladies? Wow sooooo original.""
But then I'd just be like...

My man

He doesn't just ""get the ladies""

This lad FUCKS

SUPREMELY.

but nah real talk he had a super awesome character arc and died in a really satisfying way. So much so that I went ahead and made him a demi God in my own homebrew world/campaign."
DnD,fn2blv4,t1_fn2beb9,1586583539.0,Nah you're not far off. We do love our touques and our flannels.
Illustration,fn2aion,t1_fn2abb8,1586582576.0,"Haha yeah dude 5e. I didn't even want to play the stupid game! But the DM wouldn't budge on me backing out. So he rolled the stats, hands me the sheet and was like you can be a monk or a bard. So I was like...

Can I make him a petite effeminate man with a high pitched voice who gets absolutely all the ladies while respecting them?

And that's how it all started. I love my stupid bard."
Illustration,fn2a6hj,t1_fn2a2k6,1586582278.0,YES! Good catch friend! His look is totally based of Eric Nally. I love Foxy Shazam so naturally my first ever bard had to be a Nally clone (and a Dandelion clone but shhhh) ;)
DnD,fn1xjjf,t1_fn1xeub,1586572527.0,Good enough for me!
DnD,fn1up9r,t1_fn1ulgk,1586570549.0,"It is a pretty whimsical place, my friend."
DnD,fn1ujag,t1_fn1uer7,1586570435.0,"Precisely!

Nah but this just looks like most Halifax suburbs and playing 5e across 2 porches seems to me like a very Hali thing to do."
ukulele,fn1syz6,t1_fn1suq2,1586569385.0,Thanks bucko but I am not doing a diddly darn thing. Keep up the folk punk jams though! They secretly fuel me. Hah!
DnD,fn1srck,t3_fytiuc,1586569246.0,Yo is this Halifax?
DnD,fn1p8hu,t3_fyjlrn,1586566937.0,"I play a dark elf bard as one of my mains. We're in a homebrew world but essentially the DM has written into the story that dark elves are essentially discriminated against save for a few exceptions.

So I play my boy one of two ways. First he's a Charlatan so I set him up with a pre built disguise where masquerades around as a high elf woman representing some fictional noble house.

When that doesn't work he falls back on the rampant discrimination and accuses those who mistreat him for being hateful and backwards.

Did I mention he's lawful evil? So yeah while he's out here berating NPCs for assuming he'd be evil just because he's Drow he's simultaneously sifting through all your shit."
DnD,fn1n2tz,t3_fybmgy,1586565561.0,God I love me a good bard.
ukulele,fn1elb0,t3_fyl4nx,1586560394.0,Oh my goodness! I love this song! Very near and dear. Good job!
BPD,fn0pbhy,t1_fn0oc41,1586546185.0,"Fuck dude. That's awful... I'm sorry you're dealing with that but I'm grateful you told me. Your experience is important and valid.

I appreciate your input on my original post, it helps give perspective. It's funny with my FP. We've known each other about a year and half now and sometimes I feel like I get them and we really connect and then other times I wonder if I really know them at all. So in my case I'm thinking of leaving it and if it comes up I'll deal with it then.

Thanks again and if you feel like just having someone to talk to drop me a line. I can't promise I'm a font of advice or anything for your experiences but sometimes it helps to just be heard.

Stay strong."
BPD,fn03ea2,t3_fyhdyj,1586534735.0,"I do this all the time with all kinds of people. Sometimes it's just spamming them with memes. Sometimes it's just sending something like ""Mhmm"" or ""ugh"".

The irony is when someone does this to me I find myself getting frustrated and pulling away. It's all a big mystery to me hah."
BPD,fmzrlmk,t3_fy7cim,1586528069.0,Wow this is me... Isolation or not haha. I've tried wrapping my head around sexting with integrity. Like if it goes beyond texting like that more than once or twice I usually make it known I'm not looking for a relationship/am non monogamous. Though that usually comes from my innate ability to over share which I usually regret later :')
BPD,fmzpbes,t1_fmzp889,1586526600.0,DM me?! I've been trying to start chats with people but it keeps telling me I can no do that.
BPD,fmzouri,t3_fyf6vv,1586526292.0,"Holy cow I feel that. I had someone (not my FP but still!) ditch what I thought was a fun, casual, blossoming friendship because I wouldn't be with him exclusively. And it wasn't like a ""oh we're on different pages"" he straight up started ghosting me.

Man I just wanted someone to smoke weed and watch Futurama with.

If I had Animal Crossing I'd tell you to hmu but alas. Who knows. Maybe I'll use my emergency response benefit to buy it but if you want a platonic nerdy friend I'm here. I just don't have Animal Crossing."
BPD,fmzmrj7,t1_fmzmqmk,1586524819.0,<3
BPD,fmzmoh0,t3_fyf9h7,1586524757.0,"Hey. I've read this and I hear you. You're right. It isn't fair that people have the expectations of you to control yourself when they can't even do the same. I often feel my rage spike at the thought of that. If a neurotypical person finds controlling their feelings and reactions you think it would show them how hard it is for us! I'm angry people make you feel that way but I also pity them.

You're in pain but you're stronger than you think even if you don't feel it or believe me. Thanks for venting. Thanks for sharing. Your experience validates others, including myself."
BPD,fmzlt1i,t1_fmzcz5k,1586524110.0,Same! I consume a huge amount of YouTube and since joining reddit only 3 days ago it's all I've been doing!
BPD,fmzjr99,t1_fmyxuyg,1586522504.0,"Interesting perspective. Thanks for sharing your experience! So you're still friends with this person? I, like you, am hoping I can learn better coping skills so that my FP doesn't consume so much of my attention. It's really a tricky situation... Telling vs not telling. I did tell my FP to maybe do some research on loved ones with BPD but I'm realizing that may have been a mistake since there's so much material out there that demonizes us...

As for me I'm still holding off telling them for now (isolation is not helping my case. I want to say something so badly but I know it's just so I can have their attention). Thanks again for sharing your experience!"
BPD,fmyrfad,t1_fmyojbc,1586493553.0,"Someone else on here started a thread very similar about ""how do you hang on to that puppy love feeling"" in a relationship, which is something I always try (and fail) at doing. But it was cool to see a comment from a person who seemed to grow past that need (don't ask how. If I knew I'd do it too lol) and it kinda gave me hope that I could maybe do it someday too.

But until then it'll be chasing that early relationship high and obvious flirtation with people I hardly know! Haha"
BPD,fmyr4di,t1_fmyqwbk,1586493303.0,Of course! Keep up that self discovery right. It couldn't hurt to have more answers.
BPD,fmydetq,t1_fmya6pi,1586483573.0,"To be fair it's the first half of an article where the author is trying to decide if they should be alone or polyamorous but I'll send it anyway because the first half did resonate with me and she seems to have written other articles in her experiences as a person with BPD and relationships. Still good to read as much as we can though!

[Is Polyamory the Solution to Dating with Borderline](https://medium.com/sexography/is-polyamory-the-solution-to-dating-with-borderline-personality-disorder-7bd07f67858)

And stupid me... I didn't even consider that you may not even be in a romantic relationship with your FP! Ah well you don't have to read it but I didn't want to leave you hanging!"
BPD,fmxvbpz,t1_fmxtlkn,1586472585.0,"I've read a little bit on an article where a woman addresses her BPD and how it affects her in her romantic relationships and how she's opted out of certain relationships before they even form in an attempt to create a block between her and the inevitable emotional meltdown/drain she know she's going to have.
I've honestly considered doing the same but I don't know which is worse for me."
BPD,fmxoby5,t3_fy0njt,1586468748.0,"I do go through that emotional drain too for my FP and have plenty of times over the years. I feel you too when you say you just ""accept abandonment"" as this is something I do too.
Even just being in isolation the last 3 weeks my emotions for them have drained to an empty point almost 3 times! But somehow it keeps filling back up again and I agree it's very exhausting.
Your FPs behaviour may have you feeling empty but just know you're not alone here!"
BPD,fmxmct5,t1_fmxly6v,1586467690.0,"Yeah I got it from Dr Daniel Fox on his ""Favourite Person & Borderline Personality Disorder"" video. He's been pretty insightful for me lately but I'm only just getting into his stuff."
BPD,fmxln3a,t3_fy0pgc,1586467303.0,"Very much the same. Before I was diagnosed BPD and I knew more of what it does I would often say that the first 2 weeks of getting to know someone was the best. Just enough time to fall in love with them and enjoy them but the problem was I'd start to get uncomfortable after that (I still do!).
I'm still struggling with this so I don't have any sound advice to give you. Just letting you know you're not alone!"
BPD,fmxhxyk,t3_fxww6f,1586465322.0,"Idk if this is helpful or even good advice but I've been thinking a lot about how I can divert my own attention off of my FP.
I've been watching videos on how to deal with that needing feeling regarding FPs and in one of them they mentioned a ""transitional object"". Basically it sounds like it's an item that you have a deep emotional connection to (maybe it sparks a good fulfilling memory or feeling) that you can focus on without the variability of being a individual with feelings and responses to your reactions.
Idk I just found that really helpful and I think I've found my ""transitional object"" and thinking about it makes my FPs lack of attention a little more bearable."
BPD,fmxch79,t1_fmxc2es,1586462442.0,Thank you! Yeah it's definitely a case by case basis. What works for some might not work for others. I do need to feel it out. It's good to hear that yours went over well enough!
BPD,fmxc829,t3_fxzael,1586462312.0,"I feel this. I've never been good at handling or understanding sarcasm. I just take everything people say as sincere and which makes me feel hurt and/or very stupid, either way not fun.
I don't really have much for you in the way of advice but I find telling people thag sarcasm doesn't work for me has helped. It's gotten to a point where the people who know me well enough have just given up haha kind of like a sarcasm buzz kill!"
