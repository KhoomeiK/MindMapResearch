PublicFreakout,fjzi7i3,t1_fjzgx10,1583720331.0,">the view I am emulating is a commonly held belief from the left as projected by every **mainstream medium** you can think of.

what did i *just* say?  it's a shitslinging tool used in *media* to undermine the character of the opposing political world.  it *is not* a majority opinion.  a majority opinion isn't sampled exclusively from political media whose primary objective is to *sell* news.  

>a clearly observable and quantifiable reality.

go on and quantify it, then.  you'll notice that extreme leftist views (and extreme right shit slinging) fades as mainstream media skews towards more moderate left/right beliefs.  

>I know it offends you to be lumped in with something you may not agree with.

lol don't pull that shit.  you know no one's offended, i'm just telling you that you're wrong - you've been soaking up mainstream media bullshit and you've failed to consider that the views of the general public are going to be a little more nuanced than what you see on FOX or CNN.  

>parroted, in fact, by most Democratic Presidential candidates at the moment as well for example.

i don't necessarily doubt that there are some - but i couldn't help but notice that you didn't actually *provide* any examples.  i'm particularly interested to see how the examples you have in mind are polling."
PublicFreakout,fjzgbti,t1_fjzf7de,1583719065.0,"the idea that you're expressing is the loud minority of left leaning people - just like racist rednecks are the loud minority of right leaning people.  

is there a higher instance of people who think racism is a white person thing among left leaning people?  uh huh.  is there a higher instance of racist rednecks among right leaning people?  yup.  neither are the majority.  these are tools used by opposing political worlds to undermine each others' characters, which is why they're so prominently discussed in mainstream media and political discussions.

i've been hanging around moderate left people for most of my life.  guess what?  we all make fun of the ""black people can't be racist"" sentiment every bit as much as right leaning people.  you're just wrong, mate.  this is not a majority opinion of the left."
