basically, when you give your body less energy (i.e.: fewer calories), it adjusts to NEED less (meaning that starvation mode actually DOES exist). your bmr + your resting energy expenditure drop sharply, so you gain more easily by continuing to restrict. the article goes on to focus on long-term weight restoration, so it doesn‚Äôt really go into the science behind increasing calories short-term and going back to restricting to lose more. i‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs an article for that somewhere though!
