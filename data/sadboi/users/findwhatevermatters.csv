librarians,flvuy4u,t1_flu4lto,1585532711.0,"I also graduated from Clarion about 10 years ago. I was in the special collections cohort. The classes were varied and introduced me to the foundations of librarianship. I work in a fairly prestigious academic library and Iâ€™ve met multiple people who have also graduated from Clarion. When I went, I did not like that you couldnâ€™t choose your own classes, they just assigned you to courses, but I think that structure has since changed."
depression,fckmm2m,t3_ehn262,1577728613.0,"I can completely relate. I bought a brand new journal about a month ago and some pretty colored pens to write in it, but I canâ€™t bring myself to do it. Iâ€™ve been really depressed lately and I donâ€™t want my first entry to be full of crappy random thoughts that will ruin the journal."
relationship_advice,fc5lnoa,t1_fc3uqxp,1577460890.0,"No. Just no. Pedophilia is not even on the same planet as bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. The fact that you made such a gross comparison shows a complete lack of understanding on your part. Please educate yourself. People with bipolar disorder are not ticking time bombs with a predisposition to violence. The internet is free, please read at least an article or two before you start maligning people who have treatable mental health conditions."
relationships,f3b8y6r,t3_dgbygb,1570804652.0,"I would still be very wary. I was in a relationship with someone who would do the same thing. Not show up on time, stand me up, and not communicate about any of it. If I brought it up, I was always overreacting. Things did start to get better after some time to the point where we got married. But, he never really changed. Weâ€™re divorced now and Iâ€™m so much happier. Donâ€™t let yourself get used to shitty behavior. It just messes with your anxiety and makes you feel stuck. The lateness is also most likely a symptom of a much bigger problem. I believe people can change but it has to come from within them. Donâ€™t let your life pass you by while youâ€™re waiting outside dudes apartment for him to wake up. If he wants to be there, he will be there no matter what."
depression,f34izla,t3_dfdzpd,1570655150.0,I relate to this very much. I try so hard when I'm around other people. I don't want to bother them or make them think less of me somehow. I also feel like I got really lucky and fell into my career. I wouldn't have applied to my current job except I was recommended for it.
depression,eyk8t7k,t3_cx9fnt,1567140792.0,"Dude. Iâ€™ve been there. I was married for a year and then my spouse cheated on me. I thought I wouldnâ€™t get through it, but I did and my life is so much better now. Hang in there. The pain will pass."
depression,eyk8iz7,t3_cx1nlm,1567140496.0,"Same here. I feel the worst when I wake up. Iâ€™m always late just because I canâ€™t get myself to get moving. Iâ€™m able to enjoy some moments in the day, but overall Iâ€™m just so weary. Iâ€™m sorry you feel this way and I wish there was something I could say to help."
depression,ey5k6v2,t3_cux3hx,1566833674.0,"I'm honestly surprised and kinda sad that there are so many others out there that feel the same way I do. I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone. I want to tell everyone that it'll be ok in the end, but it makes me feel like a hypocrite. ðŸ˜”"
depression,ey16otv,t1_ey09xlh,1566691277.0,That sounds really rough. Is there anything you can do to change your situation?
depression,ey16khr,t1_exzys9c,1566691183.0,"I know this is all great advice, buying still get stuck on the part about doing stuff just because I enjoy it. Like, what's the point in enjoying anything? ðŸ˜”"
depression,ey16ewq,t1_exzyfau,1566691065.0,Same. But the minute someone asks me what's on my mind I forget everything and answer with nothing.
depression,etrx06u,t3_cd6d58,1563131017.0,Yes! This happens to me often. Sometimes I can go from heavy depression to feeling really excited in the course of one day.
depression,etrwvx7,t1_eslhysn,1563130936.0,"Thanks so much for this. Your words really touched me. I wonâ€™t say Iâ€™m giving up on the guitar or singing, but Iâ€™ve decided to give drumming a try. So far it feels really natural, so Iâ€™m hoping that with some practice this could be the instrument for me. Maybe if I gain confidence in this area, itâ€™ll carryover to dinging/guitar playing."
