dementia,fqzgx79,t3_glrtx0,1589767139.0,"How wonderful for both of you to have a friendship that is so caring &  full of trust. I'm so sorry to hear of your friend's condition & that he's struggling with tasks that would have come easily in the past. My Mom has Alzheimer's & it has been a journey & a half to learn how to best support her & give her the help she needs (but may not realize she needs) without making her feel talked down to in any way, or without losing patience after attempting to go over something simple for the eleventy-seventh time. 

I think something that helped me was to realize that it wasn't about being able to re-teach her the things she had forgotten. It's one thing if she needs a reminder, but if repeatedly, she cannot grasp how to conplete a task (after trying the patient explaining, writing it down etc), we look for ways to Get Around The Problem. Dementia isn't about intelligence - the brain, affected by the progression of the disease, becomes unable to process the world around it the way it was once able to. Memory & perception become skewed & your friend may simply not be able to remember how to follow the 5 steps. If visual clues are helpful, you could try a pictorial version of the 5 steps, but his dosease may have progressed to the point that, without cueing, he cannot complete the task himself this way.

I'm so grateful that he has you in his life. Could you maybe attend one of his next doctor's appointments so that you could get a better handle on his diagnosis, what to expect & how you might be able to come alongside him as he faces his future. I also recommend calling your local Alzheimer's society/Office for the Aged to see what resources THEY can provide. None of this is easy, for the sufferer or those of us who bear witness to it's ravages, but life is infinitely easier with a loving support system. I wish both of you the very best.

dementia,fqum9js,t3_gkxu4g,1589661167.0,"We had under a month between placing Mom in a full nursing care Assisted Living Memory Care unit before lockdown commenced. My husband & I were just talking about what we would have done if my Mom's sudden decline had been off by even a month (she was hospitalized at the start of December, dx with Alzheimer's & had surgery for a cancer diagnosis as well & we found her place mid February). Truth: it has ABSOLUTELY made it harder for her to adjust. The restrictions there have made it super difficult for Mom (and us) to get to know staff or other residents the way you would hope would normally occur. Having spent almost every day since December 6th tending to her care, at the hospital & then at the home, NOT being able to physically BE there to support her is a weight that sits heavily on my heart. Having said that, when I think about the sheer impossibility that is being able  to properly  keep someone safe who simply cannot understand the need for the precautions, I'm so relieved that she is at least in an environment where everything is being done to increase her chances. Our home is not an option for her as she wanders, cannot navigate stairs & is at increased risk for falls, so I'm grateful that her safety is paramount. The home we vetted has been INCREDIBLE in terms with how they've behaved during this time & I think that's a huge factor in making this decision, especially now. I had asked about their outbreak protocol when I interviewed them, never thinking we'd be dealing with anything of this magnitude so quickly afterwards. I think often times, as caregivers, we have to make decisions we wish we didn't have to make, where the query is what is the lesser of two evils. If your Loved One NEEDS more care than you can safely give, and you've tried to navigate other options, their safety & wellbeing may necessitate a move into LTC. However, I would HIGHLY recommend getting in touch with your local/regional Alzheimer's society/office for the care of the aged etc, & ask them for guidance on this journey. Vet the living beejeekers out of any home you're considering - ask for references of family that have loved ones who reside there, straight up ask them about their protocols & their records with previous outbreaks, ask any friends/doctors/nurses who have experience with the homes nearby if there are any homes to stay away from, & talk to friends/family about positive experiences they've had. Interview MULTIPLE members of staff at a potential place etc. It may be that you decide to wait a bit, but this decision may be something you HAVE to make, so it's best to have the research done anyway. The more decisions you can make that are well informed & not made in crisis mode, the less stressful this immensely stressful situation will be. I'm sorry, as I know ALL of this is super hard.

CrohnsDisease,fqd9u1d,t3_gi3pwk,1589284344.0,"I'm so sorry. Having a chronic illness sucks for both people in a relationship - but I know, as the person who can't walk away from the disease, there is such a vulnerability & sadness in having your inherent support system withdraw their support.

 Not sure how your illness has been in the last year or so, or if it's been more of a difficult time for you, but I think sometimes the balance between partner & caretaker tilts & caretakers (especially if they don't have strong support systems themselves) can burn out. And there's almost an implicit societal agreement that the partner shouldn't complain or resent missing out on things because it's not like their partner is doing this ""on purpose"". I think feeling comfortable about voicing how you each actually feel is vital & the embodimemt of ""You & Me VS the disease"" is the approach that gives both parties a voice to explain what it's like to live their life, with the shadow of chronic illness looming. 

My heart hurts for you, as it is really hard when you're in the midst of suffering yourself to see how that suffering can weigh on those who care about you (that's not your fault). It is an added stress in a relationship & due to it's all encompassing nature at times, without concerted effort to prevent it, the relationship can take a backseat to just getting through the day. It also takes a certain level of emparhy & compassion to be the partner of someone with IBD, & not everyone comes equipped with a reservoir. 

My best advice: give them some breathing room, let them know that YOU absolutely want to hear where they're coming from & that you are willing to talk when they're ready. You can't control their actions, but if you're still ""all in"" let them know you're willing to work through this difficult patch. Besides taking care of yourself, that's all you can do until they're willing to let you in further. Sending you support & continued strength. Xo"

It is RIDICULOUS to me to throw a conniption about what someone else is serving for THEIR wedding. It speaks volumes about her to know that she somehow equates a lack of meat served with sexual preference, but you really can't explain away stupid, so it is what it is. Put her nonsense aside for a moment: of COURSE, you should serve whatever you both want for your wedding reception. You don't owe anyone (besides your fiance) input into that decision.

   On to the larger issue. Let me preface this by saying that it sucks, but part of Adulthood is learning that we can be Right but still  choose to compromise for the greater good. Like it or not, these folks ARE your beloved's family. Talk to him about your apprehension & delve a bit deeper into the vision he has for your collective Big Day. Why is it important to him to have THESE family members there? What will it cost you to make that happen? Is it worth it? 
   
Marriage IS compromise - it's finding a way to be authentic & fulfilled while helping to support your partner achieve the same. Apologizing for your (understandable) response to her bigoted insults does not nean that you have to accept further intolerance. To be honest, she is coming across as someone who will constantly look to find fault in others but who has no concept of insight or the ability to self refiect. The best thing to do with people like that is to take away any power they have in the situation by removing any source of drama they can exploit. Kill her with kindness - you don't value her opinion, so remove her from the equation. 

Your fiance has grown up with this dynamic in the family - support him by helping him see that it doesn't HAVE to be that way, that ultimatums are the act of the desperate & that you ARE the bigger person because you are capable of putting someone else's needs above your own need to be right. Which you are. And with time & support, hopefully your fiance is strengthened by your love & confidence so that he can feel whole without needing to accept nastinesss in the guise of family. Likely outcome:  she'll find something else to complain about but your fiance is less likely to be held hostage by her nonsense if he knows that he's marrying his own super hero, who can leap over tall buildings of homophobic BS ""disguised"" as manufactered conflict. 
Whatever you ultimately decide to do, I wish you both a long & happy life together, filled to the brim with the love & support of people who lift you up, not tear you down."

I understand that, like so many of us globally, people are having to make difficult choices, millions of people's lives have been torn asunder & families are worried about having the very basics to survive. This is all fact. It is ALSO fact to recognize that, more so in some countries, governments have not been prepared &/or have not stepped up in an appropriate way to help their people deal with the fallout of this unprecedented situation & people are desperate to get back to some sense of normalacy.. But you lose people (figuratively AND literally)  by saying that this virus is not dangerous, that it doesn't have far reaching impacts for people of ALL ages & we should just proceed as though we don't still have an ACTIVE pandemic that is still evolving.

It is NOT the flu - it HAS a higher lethality, a markedly increased transmission rate, we still don't have any idea what damage the virus will do, long term, to those it doesn't kill, & the fact that people can be asymptomatic & shedding the virus for a relatively long period all mean that THIS is a situation we ALL need to be taking MUCH more seriously. Until we have treatments that are proven to work &/or a vaccine, social distancing, enhanced hygiene, the incorporation of appropriate PPE & changes to the way we function in society ARE the ways we keep the vulnerable safe. One person's rights & freedoms do not mean that they get to make choices that put everyone else at risk. By not following sound scientific guidelines, people who jump the proverbial gun are very likely going to cause the actual social distance stay-at-home need to lengthen. Which will be worse for EVERYONE.

We are war with a virus - it can't be reasoned with, it doesn't care that you're suffering, & logically, to protest the recommendations needed to mitigate the spread so that the health care systems don't collapse is just a waste of energy. You can look to other countries, taking VERY measured steps forward BUT you have to simultaneously acknowledge what has been accomplished first. You cannot realistically compare, for example, Italy or Ireland's country wide cohesive lockdown to the checkered reaction by individual states. The United States needs to actually BE united in this effort if we are to hope to not be back in an even more challenging position in a few months.

The economy is vital - of COURSE it is, but  capitalism should not be revered over human life. The way forward is through aquired, shared knowledge. It is the Government putting aside ego & greed & doing their jobs to help their people weather this storm. People SHOULD using their voices, their money & their votes to safely evoke change in government response. More financial support & protections need to be given to the American family & the small businesses that NEED it the most. Businesses need help preparing & implementing necessary changes that will keep people as safe as possible - from revamping office set-ups to allow for the minimum distancing requirements, to staggered schedules or allowing continued WFH options, reconfiguring HVAC systems so that we aren't inadvertently spreading this virus, to looking at how the public can be served, safely AND employees can go to work, with appropriate PPE so that people DON'T have to choose between a paycheck & their wellbeing or the wellbeing of those they love. All that needs to be sorted out BEFORE we open the proverbial gates & unfurl the ""Mission Accomplished"" banner.

 It SUCKS but this is an Adapt or Perish scenario. No one WANTS this to be the way things are but we need to make smart, measured decisions, informed by science & we need the public to follow safety measures to keep each other healthy. We get to be impatient, scared, & frustrated at the sense of powerlessness but you cannot say this virus isn't serious or that , by reopening early, you aren't taking risks your wallet can't cash when it comes to a second (and third) wave of outbreaks. Waves that will undo the good that has been done by the tine we've collectively invested in our future by Staying Home. 

My heart BREAKS for the world at large; people are separated from loved ones, they've lost the ability to provide for their families & live their lives, & all at the hand of an unseen foe. It's understandable & patriotic to want the government to (like countless other countries have done) step up & protect the livelihood of the ""Little Guy"".

Those with dementia have difficulty perceiving their environment as things progress - it's why we are recommended to put stickers or decals on sliding glass doors, so as to clearly demarcate them.  There are stickers & wallpapers that could allow you to make the door look like a bookcase or what have you. Less drastic would be to fit the door with a more difficult lock to prevent her from opening it (if you paint it to be the same colour as the door, she might not even be able to perceive that it's there), or install a new electronic locking system. 

If Mom's condition is progressing to where you're rightfully concerned about her safety, perhaps another family or someone could check in on her during your workday to make sure thst her needs are met. She may just be lonely or confused, but as I'm sure you know, dementia can also make it difficult for people to pereceive hunger, thirst or the need to use the facilities but their body will be giving off signals.

Medication should be approached with caution - anti-psychotics can have side effects BUT this is a balancing game of a situation, whereby you may need to adjust your thinking to interventions as time & symptoms progress, so keep chatting with the doctors & do your research on any drugs they suggest. Not sure if FIL is taking Melatonin in the evening but I know it has made a world of difference for my Mom, in terms of helping to regulate her sleeping, which in turn ABSOLUTELY impacted her day (and ours).  

Every person is different, so I don't want to generalize too much, but what we've found when someone with dementia becomes fixated on something that is factually untrue &/or they're behaving in an irrational manner, the first thing we do (now) is take a DEEP breath. The calmer I am, the better the exchange seems to go. 

Don't argue - it will get you Nowehere, quickly, & will often agitate your Loved One, you can't use logic & rationalize the situation with them & it just devolves from there. Instead, try & just ""Go with It...& Pivot"" (try not to judge me too harshly, but in my head I think of this with the same gesture as the ""Bend & Snap"" from Legally Blonde). 

So, for example, my Mom got very worried about her leg (she was hospitalized  for 2.5 months back in December, after she declined suddenly & significantly, was simultaneously diagnosed with Alzheimer's & Cancer & had surgery on her leg to remove the lesion, before she was moved to a full care Nursing Home, waiting for a bed in Long Term Care). Not just the leg that she had surgery on, but the other one. She wouldn't make a lot of sense - she couldn't really string together a reason WHY she thought something was wrong (it didn't hurt, there were no bumps or marks there, etc) but she was visably upset & anxious. We had the staff check, repeatedly, to make sure that there (a) WAS nothing wrong with the leg (b) that she didn't have another UTI, which can 100% lead to an increase in dementia behaviours & (c) that we were all attending to her unspoken needs (because their brains aren't processing the world optimally, sometimes an increase in dementia related behaviours result because your patient or Loved One is hungry, or in pain or cold or has to go to the toilet but they can't perceive it accurately or can't express their needs). With that in the works, we ""Bend"" : we learned to acknowledge that we HEAR that she's distressed, that we are LISTENING (even if we can't understand what she is saying, we can attest that we care & that her distress matters to us), that her FEELINGS are important to us, & we try to understand & reassure her that we love her, she's OK & we're a team that will deal with whatever life throws at us together. 

Then....'""SNAP!"". We Pivot. It might go like this ""Mom, I know you seem anxious about your leg. I hear you & we absolutely have talked to your doctor about it & I will talk to them again. The hospital has been a lot to adjust to & we know you're doing your best, & we are very proud of you. We love you & we're here for you, always. HUG. Mom, LOOK at what we brought in for you today - one of your favourite CDs. Let's listen to this song & have some of this tasty treat we picked up"". You learn what is ""successful"" by just continually approaching, seeing what works (or doesn't) & reapproaching later if you aren't successful at the outset (Spoiler: that was rarely the case - trial & error was/is my friend). Music is a wonderful Pivot, so is a favourite topic or hobby.

 I'm in the process of putting together a Memory Box for my Mom with familiar bits & bobs (photos,  fabrics, scents, special talismans) that she can look at, smell & touch to bring her some comfort. We also found that, after digitizing an incredible amount of family photos, a digital photo frame was almost more interesting to my Mom than her TV. Going through photo albums of your Bonus Dad's life might also be a bonding experience for your family. You can reminisce with him, without demanding answers, & see if any of the pics spark a memory for him. Not sure if it's possible (and this may already be the case), but are there any of his familiar belongings that could be added ro your home to help him feel safe & secure? A favourite recliner, perhaps or blanket/quilt? Does he have a favourite food or a penchant for a type or food or treat that might brighten his day?

 More than anything, I want to encourage you & your family for banding together & working so diligently  to make sure that your FIL is safe & taken care of. I'm here, anytime, if you need to chat. Xo"

Music is incredibly powerful as well - could you put together some  favourite music from his era on a playlist & send that to the hospital for him? 
The reality is that with neurodegenerative ailments, there comes a point where the person affected loses the ability to process tasks they previously had mastered & it can seem to diminish suddenly in certain cases. Even a UTI can exacerbate symptoms aggressively. Time & proper care will tell if he will regain function & rebound to a different baseline but in the meantime, just  by asking these questions says a lot about how much you care about him. Sending your family support. Xo"

dementia,fp8mqy0,t3_gbyc23,1588396525.0,"HFC (Hilarity For Charity) has a weekly roster of online group chats about what its like to deal with being a caregiver to a Loved One with dementia, & they've ramped up since the Pandemic hit as (like any agency/support that deals with dementia & caregiving) the NEED for additional support has been clear. Additionally, your local Alzheimer's support group should have information & contacts to see what assistance you CAN access to help your family cope during this crisis. I would also contact your FIL's PCP or Geriatrician to see if there are any medications that he should be on to help him with some of the behaviours that can arise (not sure if he's sleeping, but obviously if your sleep schedule is out of whack, dementia behaviours will often be exacerbated). Routine is SUPER important & having a pretty steady rhythm in your home might help. Music is often helpful to calm & relax both your Loved One & you! Planning in breaks where, for example, your partner takes over ""Dad Duty"" from 730-9pm, so you can read with the kids & take a bubble bath/go for a walk/meditate/chat with a friend, & relax before bed can help to give you a bit of a break, mentally & physically. I found tag-teaming was the ONLY way I could cope & that I had to learn to step away to give my brain & heart some breathing space, so that I COULD go back & BE present in the moment. 

 I think the truth is, unless someone has been a caregiver for people with dementia (either professionally or personally) or are specialized in dealing with neurological diseases that result in these behaviours, the vast majority of people have no EARTHLY idea how hard it is. Unfortunately, that can include therapists, friends & family. But don't stop looking for support - this site is AMAZING when it comes to knowing where you're at & providing a place to vent, chat & find genuinely helpful. You are a LION of a human being for making it THIS far & for caring enough to be the safety net your Loved One needed, in a freaking Global Pandemic! You're only normal & human to be affected by this & you're doing the right thing by recognizing that you're experiencing burnout & need a different way forward. We're here for you & I'm sending you & your family GIANT socially distant hugs via the interwebs. Xo"
dementia,fp8khtp,t3_gbw7b0,1588394709.0,"It's OK to know that you might not be temperamentally suited to care for people with dementia. It takes an extraordinary amount of patience & compassion but truthfullly, it helps tremendously if you keep in mind that because of how dementia causing neuro-degenerative ailments progress, the person living with the disease is, at a point, not responsible for how their brain is allowing them to analyze & respond to others & their environment. They may have mood swings, emotional outbursts & strike out but it's because they are  unable to communicate how they're actually feeling, and/or they have perceived the situation to be somehow dangerous, anxiety causing or scary & they are confused. Their behaviours can be SO different from how they were prior & in many cases, family & carers have to learn what ""works"" for them now. Introverted & extroverted behaviours may be retained, but people with dementia often deal with a host of related behaviors, like depression & apathy, so their affect can be altered for many reasons.

 Arguing is never wise as it just provokes, & enhances the negative & again, it's pointless because, even if you're trying to explain that ""No, you live HERE - that's your husband of 45 years"" (and you're 100% factually correct), the person's brain has deteriorated to the point that they cannot recall this AND they can't process the rationalization (""see, this is your wedding photo & look here, you planted this rose bush the year you bought the house""), & their brain is telling them different. You have to become ""part of their world"": learn about favourite people, places, hobbies, memories etc, &  learn from trial & error & LOTS of talking with Loved Ones & other professionals to see what behavioural techniques you can use to distract, redirect, re-approach & deescalate the situation so, WITHOUT restraint (as much as is humanly possible, physical or chemical ""restraints"" should be a Last Resort), you can keep the patient safe & cared for. You never hit back - that would be assault. You would make sure the patient is safe, remove yourself from the fraught situation & reapproach them later.

 They aren't children, but just as children should not be expected to understand & behave in a way that is not consistant with their age & experience (""Hello 3 year old. Explain to me, in your own words, what this Med-Surg textbook is stating & then, tell me how you feel about the fact that it is statistically more likely that your generation is going to be the first to die before your parents""), nor should someone dealing with dementia be expected to behave as though they DON'T have this issue. They can't control it, change it, or curb it with will power. People (carers, family, facilities) need to see around the proverbial corners FOR them & make their environment as safe & supportive as they can so that the person affected has the best quality of life that they can, for as long as they can.

In caring for people dealing with dementia behaviours (or really, caring or being responsible for ANYONE vulnerable), it helped me to remember that THIS is someone's mother, father, or child - how would I want someone to behave if this was MY loved one? The answer, invariably, is by taking the best possible care of them - get to know them, learn about their condition & their likes/dislikes, &  be kind & compassionate. My overarching takeaway is that a Caring Profession is a career that should be guided by a desire to help people, without judgement,  when they are vulnerable, a commitment to constantly obtaining knowledge about the BEST ways to keep those in your purview safe, healthy & holistically taken care of, & an attitude that will allow you to learn from your mistakes with grace & dignity (towards others AND yourself). I'm not sure where you're at in your achooling, or what clinical experience you have already, but you know yourself best. Be self-reflective - if you know that you are not suited to a certain kind of environment, that's OK. Choose an environment to work in that you ARE better suited towards & there are a multitude of facilities & home care scenarios that need carers. Whatever type of caring scenario you DO decide to concenrate on, or whatever kind of client you end up working with, start by looking at the strengths & attributes you have & ask yourself ""How can I make their lives better by using my skills & personality?"".  I wish you the best of luck as you continue to learn!"
dementia,fp4b9th,t1_fp3tzk6,1588295416.0,"Me, three! I'm so sorry that you're having to deal with all of the trials & tribulations of Dementia, on top of a Pandemic, & feeling like you don't have a safety net of support people nearby. It's absolutely understandable that you are feeling overwhelmed at present! Very few people who haven't, sadly,  had to deal with a Loved One who has been ravaged by Dementia truly ""get"" what we're going through. I think, especially right now, most people are just doing their best but are already at close to maximum capacity with their own ""stuff"", so sometimes you have to cast that support net a little wider. OP, I'm so proud of you for reaching out to this community & asking for what you need; so often  Caregivers push  their own emotions to the side & try to run on fumes & it may not SEEM that way right now, but it's not a bad thing to KNOW your limits. In terms of practical support, can I ask what the safety concerns are the 2x weekly bathing assist? That's an onerous task at the best of times & if you're using a CNA or a PSW & they aren't a good fit, it might be worth raising ypur concerns to see if they alternative options for you. I'd also consider giving Grandpa's PCP or Geriatrician a call & explain where things are at, &/or giving your local chapter of the Alzheimer's Society a call as THEY may know of some respite programs or options that ARE still available or, now that some time has passed & health care providers are having to adapt, have newly BECOME available. I know it sounds trite, & is MUCH easier said than done, but if you CAN, scheduling in a few slots of ""Decompression Time"", even 20 mins at a pop, it would give you a bit of time to focus on you, or do something that leaves you feeling fuller, rather thsn depleted, afterwards. And please, if you want, DO reach out to those in this community who have offered - this disease process is henious, but it doesn't HAVE to be born alone & you can find non-judgmental support AND ideas, & a comradary that is beyond uplifting. Additionally, either through your local chapter of the Alzheimer's society (not sure where y'all are located) or via a charity like HFC (Hilarity For Charity), there are online peer support groups & workshops that are trying to specifically support those who, due to Covid-19, are now the caretakers of Loved Ones under VERY trying circumstances.

dementia,fp29v4k,t3_gan1dq,1588257972.0,"It is really helpful to understand that, due to the way diseases that cause neurodegenerative progress, the brain is no longer functioning properly. Cognitive concepts like reasoning & logic are skewed & what ""makes sense"" from our perspective may not be what ""makes sense"" from your friend's Mom's point of view. It also helped me  hugely, with my own Mom, to recognize that, when she says or does something that upsets me, it is the DISEASE not my MOM, as some of her behaviour is SO out of character. It is a scary thing to witness, & much easier said than done to be able to be calm, patient & unruffled by Dementia's unwelcome presence BUT if you can get there (even some of the time) it gets easier & your lack of stress can totally have an impact on the person siffering from these behaviours.

What I have learned, the hard way, over the last 6 months since my Mom's condition suddenly declined drastically & we FINALLY got a diagnosis, is that I am not going to be able to FIX this. As much as i wish it weren't true, it just IS. And because I don't know how much time we have left with her, especially at this level of cognition, I don't want to waste time that could be spent having meaningful connection with her because I'm focused on the impossible. I WILL fight for a cure for this, I will continue to be an advocate & raise awareness & funds for people with dementia-causing illnesses BUT my prioroty now has to be making sure my Mom has the best quality of life that she possibly can. I keep abreast of any research data that emerges, I keep a slew of professionals on speed dial, & if something MIGHT benefit Mom (be it traditional medication, therapies, CBD oil etc), I thoroughly look into it & weigh the benefits against the downfalls, all through the lens of Mom's Quality Of Life. The change in perspective helped me to refocus on something I can have more control over, rather then beating my head into a wall, theoretically, as the powerlessness that is watching your Loved One disappear in front of you is like nothing else I've experienced. My heart goes out to you, & I STILL battle with the ""What more can I do"" quandry, as it never really feels like enough, but it's getting a bit easier with time, & acceptance. This community & my local Alzheimer's society support group have been immensely helpful & I highly recommend that you continue to seek peer support as this can been a lonely journey - in my case, this is especially true as my Mom is relatively young, so none of my friends have gone through this with their parents & because, aside from my husband & my sibling's young family, all of our extended family are overseas & we lost my Dad back in 2014.

If you now need another $20O-300 upfront for a bed, toys & potentially missing shots, and an extra $3000 or so a year (just pulling numbers from the air here,   please bare with me), then sit down with ypur wife to brainstorm either specifically what will need to be cut from your budget &/or what SHE is prepared to do to earn the additional money. This isn't the fault of the Dog OR your daughter, but your wife has flagrantly broken both your trust & the duty as a parent to teach your daughter how to behave responsibly. How you handle this WILL likely be something your daughter remembers - if your wife cannot contribute to solving the problem she created, then she should be the one to explain the error of her ways both to your child & the shelter. The dog deserves to be taken care of properly & your child needs to know that while you will honour her dreams and feelings, you HAVE to do what is right for every living thing that you are charged with having responsibility for, & that takes love AND support in the form of funds. This just sucks so badly for the 3 beings that it least should suck for - your wife, as you well know, really ducked up here.

Alzheimers,forey79,t3_g8txbo,1588011081.0,"We are struggling to maintain a strong presence in my Mom's life right now, what with the Lockdown at her facility. My husband & I have dropped off care packages (we live 25 mins away), sent cards, planted colourful  pinwheels outside her window (so as not to have to worry about flowers dying when we can't get there as often as we would normally), tried ""through the window"" visits (she did not understand why we couldn't come in or she couldn't come out to us, and was upset), and call at least once daily. It's INCREDIBLY hard, but my fervent hope is that she DOES remember us at the end of this. My Mom has declined since this begun, & can no longer give me details about her (admittedly limited) ADL. We look up silly jokes before each phone call as she seems to get a kick out of that. If your Grandma would enjoy it, you could even read to her over the phone, but it will depend on her preferences, her attention span etc. 

. If your Grandma has really progressed & isn't able to relay details to you, an easier benchmark for you might be to make more frequent, short calls - the routine would be helpful for her & it could be a bright spot in her week  If you told me last November (Mom declined suddenly in December) that THIS would be the level at which I would be conversing with my Mom, i don't know that i would have believed you, but the way I'm trying to look at it is that THIS is where she's at & I don't want to have any regrets down the line that I didn't do EVERYTHING in my power to connect with her, in whatever way I can, while she's here, at this level of cognition, because when she declines further,  I know I'm going to be wishing I had this time back. 

It's hard, truly, but I think if you set aside your expectations, call & don't put pressure on her to have to contribute if she can't, you'll be fine. Topics she loved are a great place to start, but the more important, and overarching point is that she will FEEL that you care. Thank you for caring enough to post this & please let us know how it goes! 

P.s. 100% with the candy/sweets! It's a known phenomenon that those w/Alzheimer's often experience a bitter taste in their mouths, that is only quenched by something sweet. My Mom, who used to mske a single Mars bar last a week (not a sweet tooth but enjoyed chocolate), would tackle you for ANYTHING sweet now, so part of our care packages include some tasty treats, so that she can experience some enjoyment out of food. If your Grandma's diet/swallowing ability allows (check with your Mom or the facility, if you aren't sure), perhaps you could send a box of chocolates or something similar. I also know that the Alzheimer's society in my area (Ontario, Canada) has the option of sending an Activity Kit amd/or a device with music preprogrammed based on your Loved One's preferences to your Loved One, to help them break up some of this Enforced Alone Time, so you could check out to see if there's anything like that near you."

It helped me, more than I can say, to adopt another animal (when we were ready, of course), to try & give back a tiny portion  of the amazing gift of love that we had been given by having a Furry Friend in our lives. I think the action of showing love & caring is like a balm to our souls, & whether it's to another person, or animal, it feels like a fitting tribute to our pets who've passed on. We're here if you need a place to talk about the loss of your friend. Xo"

Covid-19 is a novel virus, and as such, we are still learning what this means for us, in terms of how it affects us & how best to mitigate its spread.  Research is obviously ongoing, but the verdict is out on whether individuals can be re-infected OR if the virus reactivates, making people sick again. This comes into play because there are individuals who caught it, apparently recovered, but then tested positive again. Not to mention, the lack of widespread testing, and that asymptomatic individuals can spread the virus without even knowing it. What I'm trying to say, ESPECIALLY with a ""few hundred cases in your county"" is that you need to just assume everyone IS positive & use social distancing, hand washing etc to protect yourself. Those few hundred cases are the KNOWN positives - the number in the community is much, much higher than that. I don't want any of you to experience what my family is going through right now  with a loved one's life hanging in the balance, connected to a ventilator, in an induced coma. I miss my family & friends terribly, but we ALL need to understand that we need to do our part to keep each other safe. I hope that you have a long and healthy life in your new home & I applaud you, OP, for caring enough about your dog to want to do the best thing for it. Please heed what I'm saying - I genuinely mean it in the most caring way. Xo"
pics,fnlwjmj,t1_fnjfc6o,1587060974.0,"This! I fought for a year & a half to get my now 70 year old Mom the proper care for what I KNEW were dementia related behaviours. It took a crisis, and a 2.5 month hospitalization before she was properly diagnosed with late stage 5 Alzheimer's, and we found a Memory Care Unit for her to wait for a bed in a Long Term Care Facility 2.5 weeks before the Pandemic hit North America in earnest. 

With a background in healthcare, I was BAFFLED at how a frightening number of health care professionals were unable or untrained to identify signs of dementia AND understand how to navigate the system in order to obtain proper care when the patient themselves has no insight. Which is a hallmark trait of dementia itself.

  It's been an exhausting, incredibly difficult, riddled with guilt journey,  but SOMEONE has to advocate for the afflicted, and truly put what is in their best interest, first. I've been the ""bad guy"" for what feels like forever, but I also know that I've literally done everything within my power to make sure my Mom is safe & as healthy as she can be, while ALSO taking into account what was/is important to her.

 It's a tightrope, with no safety net, but when it's a Loved One, it is worth it, in the long run. Ask for help, be specific, take notes, contact every professional you can, take whatever constructive help is offered & know that you aren't alone in trying to navigate this difficult journey."
Frugal,fnlrz8p,t1_fnlkzci,1587058704.0,"I NEEDED a haircut back in December, but my Mom suddenly declined & was given a dual diagnosis of Alzheimer's & cancer (because ONE dx wasn't enough to deal with, I guess. Thanks, Murphy's Law!). She was hospitalized for 2.5 months & I'm her ""Person"", so I was advocating for her every day. When she was FINALLY well enough, after surgery, to he transferred to a Memory Care Unit (to wait for a bed in a Long Term Care Facility), I spent every day there, helping her acclimate to ALL of the changes. 

Cue a Global Pandemic, Mom's facility went into lockdown, & the hair appt. I FINALLY made for myself 2 weeks ago  was (rightly) cancelled. Fast forward to last week when I realized, after letting my mop down from it's routine of ""Wash, Condition, Comb, Put-In-Pineapple-Bun-On-Head, Rinse & Repeat"", that it was encroaching on Duggar-Levels. I could tuck it into the back of my jeans! I've nearly been scalped in the middle of the night, because my poor husband deigned to roll over with my bloody hair (it had outgrown the restraint of the bun) underneath him! Drastic situations call for drastic measures.

I researched, for HOURS, ""How To Cut Your Hair During Quarantine Without Totally Botching It"", & 2 nights ago, embarked in an exercise of trust that could make or break a relationship. Happily, my other half is both industrious AND meticulous, & we tag-teamed the Chop-Chopping. 6 inches of hair on the basement floor later, & I am just grateful to not have a persistent headache from the weight of my ""crown(of-thorms)-ing glory"". 

And I'm now eyeballing the veritable Sally's Beauty Supply of wash-out colour that I've apparently been stockpiling over the last few months, in an effort to motivate myself to remember that I wanted to DO something for myself (but promptly forgot about its existence after purchasing, because Mom). My virgin hair is quaking, but I'm inspired by our foray into Vidal Sassoon-ing! I'm cautiously optimistic, but I'll keep my salon on speed dial, Post-Pandemic, for any of my ""Please-Fix-What-I-Broke"" needs!"
offmychest,fnlnxx4,t1_fnl2w02,1587056746.0,"This is easier said than done. Families are messy, often divided (especially now) by time & distance & stress exacerbates any cracks that were already there in the foundation. Ideally, of COURSE, one main  point of contact is the way to go, but no one can prevent another family member from making these type of calls. My background is healthcare & I 100% understand & appreciate the message OP is trying to send. However, I also have a 70 yr old Mom, newly diagnosed with late stages Alzheimer's, who has just had surgery for cancer & is in a locked Memory Care Unit waiting for a bed in a Long Term Care bed. I am her ""Person"", I am charged with being her advocate & if she needed to be hospitalized again, I would obviously be respectful of the incredible duress that staff are under, but I ABSOLUTELY would be making daily calls because that is my MOM. 

There is a balance to be found. Potentially, nursing students or designated support staff could man the lines at facilities & be able to convey vital information to the appropriate people, so as to free up the nurses who are entrusted with direct nursing care.

 My heart is with the Healthcare Professionals but I also know the deep pain of having a loved one who is sick & unable to effectively communicate what is going on with their care. My aunt & uncle are both Covid-19 positive, & my aunt has been flown to a specialist lung facility, is in an induced coma, on a ventilator, fighting for her life. We have appointed my cousin, who is a also a doctor, to be The Contact, but the waiting, & worry, are endless.

 I guess what I'm saying is that, like in a multitude of other circumstances in life, each situation  is different, and if you haven't had to walk in the shoes of people on BOTH sides of an issue, it is VERY easy to overlook the nuances involved. And also, thank you to every one of the people who are  breaking their backs to care for the afflicted. You shouldn't be martyrs, but you deserve the praise reserved for Those Who Wear Capes. Xo"
helpme,fnlgirz,t3_g2a3pb,1587053153.0,Checking in to see how you're doing today - thinking about you.
inthenews,fnjdtry,t1_fniz4sf,1586996961.0,"You have responded to 2 different people. I am not the OP. I have responded to your comment & the fact that you have not, can not in fact, account for the major pitfalls in this administration's approach, speaks volumes. I did not say Trump did NOTHING until mid Match. 

What I did spend time & effort trying to convey to you was the hypocrisy of Trump, not in an effort to run roughshod over you with unsubstantiated information, but rather  by using the ongoing dichotomy of his own statements to illustrate how he has failed to lead the US in the manner for which he now wants praise. 

And it would be one thing if he, or his supporters, could own up to the mistakes made & proceed in a way that puts the health & safety of the country FIRST, but his childlike refusal to own ANY fault, while fobbing blame off on a myriad of others, will be to the detriment of the very people the constitution is meant to protect."
inthenews,fnixig8,t1_fnipmp6,1586988121.0,"We have learned, over & over again, that Trump will SAY anything, but that doesn't mean it's FACT. Yes, he ceased travel from Chinese nationals, which MAY have helped buy the country more time. Time he shouldn't have needed because there are multiple sources now proving that For Years, this administration has known that a Pandemic was a MAJOR threat, & yet they did NOTHING constructive to shore up resources or put key figures in play to plan for such an event (in fact, he dismissed the members of a committee specially designed to do just that). The scientific community was hesitant on how much said travel ban would help, because, by that point, countries across Europe were being affected, and it didn't stop or even medically really screen people who were travelling internationally during that time. But alright, he banned Chinese nationals.  What did they then DO with the time they supposedly gained, to MITIGATE the spread? Which is what EVERY expert across the globe has realized needs to be the priority.

Your source says Pence talked to individuals about resources. And yet, how many thousands of deaths later, and STILL medical professionals across the country are SCREAMING that they simply do not have the basic PPE & medical equipment needed to save the lives they are risking their own for. Trump has gone on and on about how testing is available for anyone and everyone who needs it, and that would be laughable, if lives weren't hanging in the balance. The US is now the epicentre of a global pandemic, and accountability MUST be placed largely at the feet of an administration who downplayed the virus, over & over again,   because they were afraid of the impact it would have on the stock market & the upcoming election.

 By doing so, in addition to instigating a pissing contest with Governors who don't praise him, Trump has let an opportunity where he COULD have risen to the occasion, acted responsibly, put his ego and his bank account aside for the good of the nation, & LED this country through an organized & effective shutdown, relying on the healthcare experts & the scientific data being compiled, so that when it is truly safe to LIFT the restrictions, the country COULD recover and carry on. He did not do that. He STILL is more interested in being praised and coddled, then actually doing what it right. 

I'm in favour for the immaturity and blatant greed to be put aside, for both parties to work together to put the health of the people, upon who's backs the 1% makes their fortunes off, first. So that all of THIS is not done in vain, and at the expense of even more individual's livelihoods and their actual lives. 

But to source a list that Trump's campaign put forth vaguely congratulating themselves on their awesomeness, without then pointing directly to the Actual Steps They Have Taken, which then would lead to Actual Proven Positive Forward Motion, is both naive & misleading. This was always going to be a disaster -  it's a Global Pandemic, lives were going to be lost. But by using science as a jumping off point, having accountability as political  Leaders, making  reasoned & educated decisions with forethought & the good of ALL the people at heart, it did not need to be NEARLY as bad as it is. And no amount of screaming about ""Fake News"" or his bloody TV ratings, no deflection or attempt to rewrite documented history is going to absolve Trump and his administration of that. 

I respect your right to your opinion, but supporting Trump by using Trump's information as fact, WITHOUT simultaneously actually looking at the totality of what he HAS said & done or not done ( that he takes no responsibility, that he has absolute authority, that the virus would miraculously disappear, that it was nothing to worry about, that he KNEW it was serious before anyone else, that testing is readily available, that it's not his fault that testing is not available, that there is enough PPE & ventilators, that it's not his fault that there AREN'T enough of said items  etc), makes you lose credibility as someone who is rooted in truth."
