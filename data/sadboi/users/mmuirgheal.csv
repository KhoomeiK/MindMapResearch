TaylorSwift,fnug7er,t3_g3xkk2,1587261352.0,"She had barely started that I was already in tears. I can‚Äôt believe that she sang that song, it was obvious that it was so emotional for her. I love her so much."

GilmoreGirls,fglhhb4,t1_fgl4ft5,1580897984.0,Oh I agree that she completely failed the interview and it was painful to watch
TaylorSwift,fg36dxx,t3_evvcuu,1580472151.0,"Ok thought: it‚Äôs a nice simple song, that has a clear message and works great as a promotional single for the movie. I‚Äôm happy it didn‚Äôt end up on Lover because it wouldn‚Äôt have been the same"
GilmoreGirls,ffvdv0n,t1_ffu8jur,1580261806.0,Oh my god don‚Äôt even get me started on this. He doesn‚Äôt even let Lorelei explains herself or the context!
introvert,ffs182m,t3_eutuqm,1580170658.0,"Gosh I wish I had parents like you. Overall my mom did great but it took her so long to understand how I worked and why I spent so much time in my room.
I wish she would have told my brothers off when they made fun of me for reading or watching movies alone in my room. I also wish my father would have tried to hear me out when I talked about wanting to stay home instead of getting mad at me."

GilmoreGirls,ffoq9ka,t3_etm7bj,1580080451.0,"Every scene with Anna Nardini in it, but especially the episode of the birthday party. The way she talked to Lorelai was so rude and disrespectful."
GilmoreGirls,ff7e00w,t3_erx5ti,1579647366.0,"I was thinking this just this morning! I was hoping someone else noticed so I‚Äôm reassured

Edit: I am watching the episode where she meets Logan‚Äôs parents and it‚Äôs sooo bad! Her voice is so high-pitched, which I can attribute to nervousness and stress but still, it‚Äôs a good example of what you meant"

friends_tv_show,fbeycan,t3_eczyeb,1576796892.0,The misunderstanding about who proposed after Rachel gave birth. I find it so cringeworthy and the whole thing could have been avoided with communication
TaylorSwift,f9jwmjr,t3_e5fcae,1575387533.0,Oh I went to see her at the BTS for the 1989 World Tour! The stage is so good! Congrats and have fun!

friends_tv_show,f5erq9q,t3_dnhof8,1572174138.0,"Thank you!! During my many rewatches, I realised how toxic he was in his relationship with Rachel (she‚Äôs not perfect either but still) but also towards Monica, by refusing to see that their parents treated her differently and kinda inserting himself in her relationship with Chandler."
TaylorSwift,f4qda2w,t3_dlbm91,1571751643.0,"I'm going to start with: I love Lover. It is a wonderful album.

But rep resonates more with me. It came out at the right time in my life to make it relatable and i loved the risks she took with rep. Also one thing that I think makes rep superior to Lover is its relationship to context. It came out because of the beef with Kim K and her reputation going down in flames.

In that sense, Lover kinda comes out of nowhere. Yes she is happy and in love, which makes her look ""boring"" in some way compared to her rep persona. During rep, you could tell she was driven by rage and a need for revenge, which pushed her to her limits, which could also explain as to why a lot of people don't like it"
5sos,f3wq7ey,t3_digrlz,1571214985.0,"I connect more with old 5SOS as i was a huge stan, I also grew up and started to ""just"" listen to their music, meaning i don't really watch videos anymore, whereas before I would spend hours watching videos of them being funny"
harrypotter,f3tuic8,t1_f3tua2s,1571146423.0,It's just that I feel a bit left out from my group of friends when we talk about this. Thanks for the advice

Anxiety,ey98lkt,t3_cw8ahf,1566937664.0,I have the same thing! The only way I can get to do something is like not really thinking about it I guess? Like I try to rationalise and not overthink it. And also getting it done makes me less anxious so it‚Äôs a pain but I feel so much better after

howimetyourmother,ewnv5na,t3_coyjre,1565592074.0,"I enjoyed it. The idea that sometimes you need to accomplish things in your life before happily being with someone is so real and with rewatching it, I realised how much Ted was tied up to Robin. But he wanted to get married and have kids, their relationship was doomed because of that. But Ted reaches his goal, Robin hers and it just felt right. But I completely agree with the complain about the ending being rushed"

Anxiety,evy7ndh,t1_evxzcg1,1564925178.0,"She is incredibly supportive and understood everything without me having to go into details. But the thing is that at the moment she is at her parents. But we are together, she manages to calm me down. For exemple, she started to organise where we could put our stuff if we find nothing at the end of the month.
