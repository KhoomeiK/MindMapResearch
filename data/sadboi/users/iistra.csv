bulimia,et6hm1q,t1_eskr2t9,1562512871.0,"Idk, it’s true, but when I purge I feel it going back to normal after a bit (don’t overdo the purging though, then it goes too slow or starts skipping beats..), same with the pressure on the veins... basically I can’t stop the purging because I am so scared that keeping the food in will be too much load for my body to literally process.. it’s a literal physical relief to purge, especially if you don’t go too far and manage to keep in around half of normal people’s intake, I guess.."
EatingDisorders,et6djpx,t1_eql2hv6,1562510291.0,"It works for many people with ED types, but have you ever thought about going vegan? You will be forced to eat much healthier foods in general and can build up from there, for me it really helps to eliminate 90% of the “choice stress” regarding food, simply because 90% or more of the products sold in regular supermarkets contain some form of animal based additions and are therefore no longer an option... also it helps to keep the weight more stable naturally, because all the processed foods normally make us crave more and leave us dazed and confused, while eating vegan will/might make you feel more healthy and proud of your choices, which will lead to more happiness about yourself and therefore a healthier relationship with your body and food! Remember we have only one life in this particular lifetime, it would be a shame to turn 65 and realize we have wasted the best years of our life thinking we were fatter than we actually were..... good luck and keep faith!<3 Xo"
EatingDisorders,et6btvt,t3_c90ab4,1562509166.0,"I want to wish you great strength with the situation! Being an anorexic/bulimic for 16 years now myself, I would advise to not ignore the problems. Send to serious (specialized, like recommended) therapy as fast as possible, and try to make her understand it is actually DEADLY and extremely life threatening what she is doing! Also chances are slim the situation will get better on its own, hearing the stage it is in, and seriously - it can always get worse, and the longer it is apparently accepted by the surroundings, the more it will be engraved in the core of her identity and the harder it will be to get rid of. It can get so ugly that she will wish she had gone to treatment herself, 15 years from now, at least I know I do.. so, once again, good luck and all blessings! Xo"
