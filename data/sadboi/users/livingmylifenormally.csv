Not once however have I thought at 4 am, that I am anything but luckiest person to be allowed to play with balsa and come up with ways to make people’s lives and the way they live better. 

Architecture school is a coming of age thing very few degrees will give you. You really find yourself and who you are through it. Architorture.

I'm studying to be an architect and it requires a certain level of creativity that I can't get with medication. I cycle through moods and try my best to control them using things I have learned over the years to stop them from progressing to more advanced levels. I have been in a depressive episode for the last 10 days which has disrupted everything but I see it as getting a cold, I just have to take time out to recover. It's rough but I don't respond well with terrible side effects to medication. I would only recommend it to those that have a good  psychiatric support team who agrees it can be done."

I used to dream out my whole day, then wake up, go about my day then wake up again like some spin off of inception.
