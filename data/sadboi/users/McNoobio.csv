relationships,f3uawy6,t1_f3u5c48,1571156507.0,"She said she didn’t mean exclusive as in a relationship, that was me extrapolating from what she said. Like me thinking I should’ve guessed even when she wasn’t upfront about it.

She told me she wasn’t into a relationship since she just got out of one. We couldn’t explain why we were both physically on from the first day except the fact that we were both probably rebounding.
All she said was to be exclusive as in the only person she was seeing, and she was open to being casual, just not multiple people at the same time. She would joke about how she was just using me too. 

It was not clear and not explicitly that she wanted only a relationship before we proceed since she told me herself that she didn’t want to dive into a relationship right away since she just got out of one. 
She also said she was open to exploring and she liked it how it felt with me.

I understand what you said, and I agree that I feel guilty for the same reasons because I guess she just didn’t tell me clearly enough, but I should’ve guessed anyway. 

But it wasn’t clear and she did say she wanted to try something along the lines of a friends with benefits. The only exclusive aspect she wanted was a no to multiple partners. 

While I did say “I wasn’t sure”, she was the only person I was actually seeing at the time.

When she did touch me “down there”, I didn’t really feel anything. Like, upto that point We we’re making out like all the time, it felt like the natural next step. But at that point it just felt empty, and not what I was expecting at all. It just felt like I was trying to replace my ex physically and not really being able to.

When she texted and said she didn’t want to do this anymore, I told her that I agree and this probably wasn’t what we were looking for.

I’m guilty in that I should’ve guessed and called it off, and I feel like I wouldn’t have pushed forward if she was clear on it, since I think that is probably why she is mad."
relationships,f3u4atx,t1_f3u1rdr,1571152623.0,"Yes I do. I told her we would stop if she ever felt we didn’t want to do it . I also told her to let me know if she wanted to stop anytime and I didn’t pursue her after. I asked her if she was okay with it. 
I asked her explicitly. I didn’t force her to. I didn’t want to commit when I still had feeling for my ex, not because I was just looking to get laid. 
But yes,I know what , Idid I feel bad, I feel guilty and I wish I didn’t."

Maybe even for optimization.

Either way, work on either MATLAB or Python if you’ve never programmed before."
