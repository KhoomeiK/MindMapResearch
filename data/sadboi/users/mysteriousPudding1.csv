dating_advice,fole8ch,t1_fokmqr6,1587860344.0,I guess this is called the hot and cold dating game. Look it up on youtube! It’s them not willing to invest/commit to you but however keep you hanged by being nice every one in a while
ADHD,folbcup,t3_g7tgh8,1587858640.0,"Yess! The problem is no matter how many times I look up the date. I always forget it??? Like if I need to write today’s date on my notebook i look it up on my phone and write it. 5 mins later when I switch to a new page and need to write the date again, I have to look again to the old page and copy the date from it!!! Cuz It doesn’t seem to stuck in my head"

offmychest,fo5s4kz,t3_g5u37q,1587533970.0,Yesss marram!!! Very proud of you. Hope you’ll get better❤️
OCD,fo5rnix,t3_g5oheg,1587533565.0,"YES ABSOLUTELY. Like sometimes i want to help other people who are posting and support them not only post my problems. But then I get scared that If I read their i’ll get them too. My mind would be like” good idea, what if I do this to you”"
Empaths,fo1hotp,t3_g52h66,1587433516.0,"YES YES AND YES. Beside what you said another reason is that your bullshit radar is always on. You can tell when a person is not being honest or truthful. That makes it hard to be friends with anybody because more times than not, you’ll not feel comfortable with that person. It’s hard to find someone who you just “vibe” with, and that makes it harder to be in large group of friends etc."
Anxiety,fo1hd11,t1_fnzptnw,1587433312.0,"Your comment made my day. I was literally crying to a friend over the phone telling them about your comment. 
OCD can go unnoticed especially it you suffer mainly from intrusive thoughts and don’t have many compulsions. Like if you clean excessively or something people will notice and so do you. But when it is inside your mind it is really hard to spot.

The reason I cried is that you reminded me of myself 2 years ago. I didn’t know what I had. I only knew that my mind was mean to me. I thought that it was me who was creating all of this. I blamed myself a lot. WHY CAN’T I BE LIKE EVERYONE ELSE? i spent years thinking that until I discovered that this might be caused by a mental illness called OCD. And that it is not me who is doing all of this! It’s something beyond my control and It could be treated/ or I can become better. And that was a huge relief.

However, although not everybody have the same experience as me. If you can’t deal with it yourself or with meditation technique or whatever please consult a psychiatrist as soon as possible. Don’t do my mistake of thinking I could cure this myself. I spent years watching countless videos reading multiple articles tried all the techniques and in the end nothing. It just got worse. If I had decided to go earlier to a psychiatrist, I would’ve saved yearss in suffering and wouldn’t have reached such a bad level of ocd as I was in. Keep that in mind.

Take care and I hope you get better❤️"
Anxiety,fo1ghz4,t1_fo1adto,1587432782.0,"Hey yes I do. I have ocd and adhd (I take some meds for depression symptoms that I have too). I take meds for all of these. If u think these things are affecting your life and can’t deal with them then definitely talk with your doctor and he’ll prescribe as he sees fit the situation. However, I’ve heard stories of doctors giving wrong diagnosis so if you don’t think you have Aspergers that might be true. In this case I guess it’s best to consult another doctor to get another opinion and to make sure. Then finally go to whatever you feel more comfortable with. Take care, I hope you feel better❤️"
Anxiety,fo15b5j,t3_g4y8e7,1587426048.0,"Hi. I can really relate to people having high expectations of me. I was also a high performer.

What I can tell you us this. Maybe you haven’t experienced it because you have been called “gifted” all the time, but you don’t need to be a genius to pass university. Really. Like okay suppose you don’t have these gifts anymore.. so what? Now you are like the rest of people in your major. The thing is you don’t have to be smart or anything.. you just have to study. I’m in engineering and i’m telling you from experience. 

Because you haven’t been studying a lot throughout your life it’s highly likely that you miss the proper studying strategies etc. you don’t know which style fit best for each subject.. what time of the day you’re most productive.. etc. try to develop that now.

Aside from that, i actually believe you are still smart. It’s the lack of correct techniques strategies to cope with university work is what made you fail behind. And then with all the anxieties you cam to a conclusion that “your abilities just don’t work anymore.” 

This is actually more common than you think. People who pass school without studying struggle the most in uni .. even if they’re super smart. That’s because they don’t know how to study. They were trained that things just happen because they’re gifted.

I wish you all the best❤️"
Anxiety,fnzo0rw,t1_fnz2z26,1587397673.0,I’m so happy for you. I wish you guys all the best and I hope that you continue to love and support each other❤️thank you for giving me hope! I was afraid of going into relationships because of my mental health but your experience is so comforting.
Anxiety,fnznjcl,t1_fnzl5vt,1587397421.0,thanks for sharing this is very wholesome 🥺 i’m glad you have a supporting partner. Wish you all the best❤️
Anxiety,fnzneed,t1_fnzh6ng,1587397350.0,"Hi thanks for sharing. I guess the origin of it or the cause is essentially intrusive thoughts as you said. I think because it’s kind of different from the normal intrusive thoughts cuz these result in a tense physical reaction and specially relate to old memories embarrassing stuff etc is why it got it’s own name. 

I’m glad you’re feeling better and having a supporting partner, best wishes❤️"
OCD,fnz02bd,t1_fnyz5b1,1587381948.0,"For me, I couldn’t deal with it on my own. I tried a lot of accepting thoughts etc cbt stuff for years but then I reached nowhere and finally decided to go to a doctor. When I told my doctor he told me all of the things i was trying to do (meditation, accepting thoughts, cbt) are wonderful things but just like in a war you can’t go in without weapons and medication are your weapons. He told me it’s hard to fight the thoughts and feeling etc on your own at the moment and at this state. After you get better on meds, and less anxious you can start with all these kind of therapies and cognitive behavioral stuff. When you have a good ground to build upon. I know the metaphor is not the best but it does the job😂

And what he said really made sense and it’s till now. When I think about it. It’s hard to use your own brain (which is full of anxiety or ocd) to treat your own brain. It’s a vicious cycle. But that’s my personal opinion.

I wish you the best of luck in your journey. And don’t worry about the type of medication. He may give you other medication as he sees fits. Different medication works differently with people."
Anxiety,fnyz6by,t1_fnyvb9i,1587381072.0,Hmmmm that’s creative and so accurate 😂😂😂 it definitely feels like a shiver
OCD,fnyz233,t1_fnyyjol,1587380954.0,"Hey, I don’t mind at all. I’m taking zoloft. And good luck with the doctor’s appointment. I hope you’ll start feeling better on meds. For me it helped"
Anxiety,fnysl65,t1_fnys8iu,1587374094.0,Yessss mariam. The more u avoid a thought or a feeling the more it pops up! This is the nature of intrusive thoughts. I always imagine it as my mind being a very very mean person. It likes to mess with me a lot and try my limits. I hope you feel better.
Anxiety,fnysd8j,t1_fny448l,1587373857.0,"Hello. I really hope you don’t have OCD. However, do consider that some people with OCD mostly experience only intrusive thoughts, me included. I think it’s called pure O or smth for pure “obsessive” Anyways, you know yourself best but it can help to get a professional diagnosis as intrusive thoughts a huge red flag. 
Ps. HOW CAN ANYBODY NOT LIKE MANGOES! 😂"
Anxiety,fnys3bs,t1_fnyruvm,1587373559.0,Well it’s only you! And about 700 people haha 😂
Anxiety,fnyrxrt,t1_fnyqsvh,1587373392.0,"Hey. A lot of people has said they do similar things in the comments. I believe coping behaviors change from person to person but a lot said they shake their had, do a face palm, pull hair, talk loudly etc. You are definitely not alone. And I appreciate you opening up here"
Anxiety,fnyrei2,t1_fnyineb,1587372807.0,"You know these combinations are so annoying. Like if u have OCD+ social anxiety it is a living hell. I’m so sorry you go through this too.

And thank you for giving it a name. Certainly the name describes it very well 😂

I, too have ADHD, so my mind is constantly racing. It sucks. I hope it gets better for you❤️"
Anxiety,fnyr47r,t1_fnyg3n9,1587372500.0,"I’m glad I could help reduce your worry. You all helped me feel less lonely too. Regarding not resisting the thoughts etc I know what you mean. I’ve seen most of the articles, tried meditation all of that and it just comes back. I began to see improvement after seeing a therapist and getting a medication prescribed. Not advocating for it or anything a lot of people recovered from OCD without medications (check Mark Freeman, he is the best)! However not all people are the same.

You know trying to manage a messed up brain using the same messed up brain is kinda hard .. if you know what I mean. 

so do consider that as an option. Hope you feel better❤️"
Anxiety,fnyqqnc,t1_fnygo7o,1587372102.0,"Omg you saying this means a lot, thank you sm🥺 I’m glad I could be of help during this hard time❤️"
Anxiety,fnyqm53,t1_fnye76s,1587371968.0,"Me too, I’m new here and was happy to see a lot of nice redditors. Nice meeting you too anilmd!"
Anxiety,fnye75b,t1_fnydyo6,1587360499.0,don’t worry. You know that you don’t mean to say it. OCD has this trick of letting us doubt ourselves. You just have to accept feeling uncertain. Like maybe I meant it or maybe I don’t. I don’t have to be 100% sure. You’ll feel anxious about it but that’s okay. It’s okay to feel uncertain. I hope this helps
OCD,fnye0cc,t1_fnyalgn,1587360339.0,Oh nice. Let me know if it helps. I wish you all the best❤️
Anxiety,fnydvhu,t1_fny8shf,1587360230.0,"I’m not sure but it might be ocd. Even if you don’t do physical compulsions or stuff. I mostly used to have intrusive thoughts more than anything. Anyways, therapy is useful. If you go to a psychiatrist or something you don’t lose anything. If u don’t have ocd they’ll tell u that you don’t. But if you have you’ll get the help you need. So it’s always a win situation. 
Anyways, thank u for making me feel less lonely 😂 and I hope you feel better."
Anxiety,fnydne0,t1_fny8ol3,1587360048.0,Omg yess.. especially that I’m normally the class clown always trying to say jokes and stuff. This happens to me very often and my mind makes sure I never forget💀😂
Anxiety,fnydkp1,t1_fny80ko,1587359988.0,You know what.. this is actually not weird at all. I totally understand where you are coming from and actually had similar stuff. So yeah you’re not alone and I’m glad you shared that with us 😂 I hope I don’t start imagining butts too now haha😂
Anxiety,fnyddr4,t1_fny5d4o,1587359829.0,Wow. Imagine automatically doing it when surrounded by people😂💀
Anxiety,fnydck4,t1_fny59yc,1587359803.0,"That’s a beautiful way to think of it. But I guess the most important thing is to accept the thoughts and feelings and not try to get rid of them. Because sometimes we could get trapped in rationalizing the thoughts that it becomes an obsession itself.. if u know what I mean.
But I love your perspective and I’m too very lazy 💀😂"
Anxiety,fnyd34y,t1_fny59s4,1587359593.0,"😂😂😂
i’m glad I don’t get to see myself from the outside cus I’m sure it’s weird to look at💀😂"
Anxiety,fnyczwx,t1_fny4uyc,1587359520.0,Same. Like out of the blue I remember that teacher that screamed at me in elementary school or smth and cringe💀😂
Anxiety,fnycv42,t1_fny4h98,1587359412.0,Omg yes!! I’ll be doing my uni work and suddenly remember that embarrassing moment that happened in 6th grade 💀 like why😂 where is the relation between these events?😂
Anxiety,fnycqsa,t1_fny4cvs,1587359318.0,"I’m glad you got an understanding partner! I was always scared of getting married or getting in a relationship because I thought all my anxieties and weird thoughts would get in the way. If you have OCD or anxiety,does it bother u or are u able to maintain a good relationship, if u don’t mind me asking❤️ pls don’t answer if you’re not comfortable💗"
Anxiety,fnychtr,t1_fny4zc7,1587359116.0,"Yes I know we are talking about awkward thoughts, and ppl from the outside might think it’s a silly small thing but we get a lot more stressful stuff happening to us as u said stress from work and life. This is just one part of our experience. I’m glad you got better and I hope you keep on getting better❤️"
Anxiety,fnyc85d,t1_fny6zmo,1587358901.0,Yes like I understand ppl who say don’t stress about and where they’re coming from but i be like I wish it was that easy. The nasty thing about ocd is being intrusive. Like literally ocd is a mf. When you are anxious etc it doesn’t stop nagging. You are not alone I hope we can get better
Anxiety,fnybwuz,t1_fny4eyk,1587358652.0,"Hey. I think I replied an hour ago but the reply disappeared (?!) or maybe it is till there i don’t know. Anyways if u see the message twice u know why😂
So i was saying that I’m on zoloft too and it does reduce the intensity of the feeling however i don’t feel like it solves the root problem if it makes sense. Like you still get similar pattern of thoughts (in a lesser frequency) but what changes is you don’t react as bad as u used too. It’s better than nothing thanks god but I hope i get to a solution that cures the main problem. I just want my mind to stop being so evil to me"
Anxiety,fny4wb3,t1_fny33k3,1587353479.0,Yes until I get headache then I’m screwed 😂
Anxiety,fny4tu8,t1_fny4kwj,1587353430.0,Omg thank u so much for saying that.. you make it feel like my useless tantrum is actually useful to some people😂❤️
Anxiety,fny4htm,t1_fny49hx,1587353201.0,"Hey not necessarily anxiety, I really don’t know what’s causing it I just assumed but a lot of people seem to experience this😂 so maybe we are just extra sensitive?"
Anxiety,fny49qb,t1_fny2soz,1587353046.0,Yesss electrocuted is a good way to describe it 😩why can’t my body respond normally to stuff smh😂💔
Anxiety,fny46hu,t1_fny2jv8,1587352981.0,You better think of something or else he’ll think you’re possessed 💀😂
Anxiety,fny43td,t1_fny1vmz,1587352929.0,Like it actually stopped striking before😩 it’s striking 24/7 😂💔
Anxiety,fny3nbr,t1_fny295e,1587352611.0,Oh I’m so sorry it’s bothering you this much. All I have to say is because we can’t control the automatic response our body makes when awkwardness happen we shouldn’t blame ourselves for it. Even if you acted awkward with that person so what? If I did a stupid face so what? This is sometimes what I tell myself. Anyways you’re not alone. I hope we all get better❤️
Anxiety,fny3981,t1_fny0pfn,1587352342.0,"Yes while watching tv shows I can sense the awkwardness sometimes and it bothers me. Whenever I tell my family how awkward the show is or how the host is now feeling awkward because she has nothing to say etc they look at me like an alien or smth😂 they don’t seem to find anything wrong with the show, meanwhile, i smell awkwardness miles away😂💔"

Anxiety,fny309o,t1_fny1i4g,1587352166.0,Yeah but the talking myself out of it never ends well for me😩😂
Anxiety,fnxvs6u,t1_fnxud60,1587347395.0,Thank you so much for the recommendation. I’ll look into it and see if it could help me.
Anxiety,fnxvl14,t1_fnxt0r2,1587347273.0,"I have never said I’m above anyone else and never will. I know that there are a lot ppl who suffer more than me. 

What I said in the comment was “I don’t know if you’ve gone through it or not” which is true. Because I don’t know and I didn’t want to make any wrong assumptions. 

Please don’t read more into my words than what I intended. The world is tough as it is, we need to be kinder to each other and I have replied to you with nothing other than respect and kindness.

Finally, I don’t force anyone for support and I’m not begging for it. If you don’t want to support it is your choice. Go ahead. And by the way making someone feel bad about wanting support or threatening to not support if they act in a certain way is being “selfish.” It’s not a good way to talk to someone who is vulnerable and need of help like that. I’m glad I’m in a mental state where I do not need the support of anybody and don’t need to beg people or do what they want to get their support.

Have a good day. I’m sorry you had to go through all of this. And thank you for trying to help me. But the just “toughen up and stop crying” approach doesn’t work for everybody it just makes people repress their feeling even more. And if it doesn’t work for me that doesn’t mean I’m selfish brat or above anyone else it just means that we are human and we don’t respond to thing the same way."
unpopularopinion,fnxswi1,t3_g4dh56,1587345656.0,I agree but as a girl I struggle to sleep with wet hair. It’s the absolute worse thing
Anxiety,fnxshjz,t1_fnxr8ki,1587345413.0,"Hey, I’m so sorry you had to go to the hospital and go through all of this. I hope you are feeling better.

Also, Woah! That’s really a beautiful way to view being single. I have been trying to be positive about it most of my life but you know it gets to the point where you are tired of trying to be positive about it and start to say “for real what’s wrong with me!” That’s the state I was when I wrote it but now i’m starting slowly to accept it again and to realize that everything happens at it’s perfect timing. 


Finally, I relate so much to ppl thinking i’m always happy or something. Like sometimes people will tell me in the face “how are you always so happy and energetic?” And internally i’m like you don’t really know anything about me."
OCD,fnxrkr8,t1_fnxkqzn,1587344886.0,"Yes! OCD is like a spiral or a rabbit hole. It feels sometimes that you’re drowning in your thoughts and unable to catch a breath. Sorry for being so dramatic haha! Anyways you are not alone. I feel petty for myself sometimes tbh when I get pretty excited that I feel better for like an hour and my hope gets up and all my happiness just crashes down when I start having thoughts again. I feel sad for that excited little child inside me that just wants to feel better, can’t have that and keeps on getting disappointed"
Anxiety,fnxr7ig,t1_fnxo4fi,1587344654.0,"Thank you. And i’m sorry you are going through it too. It’s just that thoughts are too intense for us. I wish we could just brush them off or something.

You’ll soon learn that changing the way u think, perspectives etc just doesn’t work. I understand what you’re saying but I can’t control myself or my mind to do as you say. If I could I wouldn’t be posting here. Again thank you so much appreciate your time!"
Anxiety,fnxqoe8,t1_fnxk5ko,1587344321.0,"Thank you so much, you can’t imagine how better you made me feel. Thank you for checking my other reddit posts, although I feel a little bit embarrassed because you could see that all I do is complain at reddit and I have so much problems. But I’m really not like that at real life. I’m so much fun and always laughing joking and being stupid. Some people get shocked when they find out I have mental disorders. Like they wouldn’t expect such an upbeat happy funny person who is cheering everybody up to have all these problems. But I feel comfortable sharing my problems here only as a stranger. I wish I can share some happier reddit soon. 
Again, it means the world to me. I really as u said believe that there’s a person for me that’d be all worth it. 
Have a nice day"
Anxiety,fnxnmnc,t1_fnxmtk1,1587342445.0,It’s a little bit more than the normal. I have a thought and from the intensity of the thought i do physical things. I.e talk louder to avoid feeling it. Physically cringe. Try to hum loudly.
Anxiety,fnxn6f4,t1_fnxj6ne,1587342171.0,Thank you. I have heard about it and was advised by my doctor to go through CBT therapy. However it is very expensive and I don’t feel comfortable making my family pay a lot although they told me they’re willing. I don’t know if you can learn it online for free or something
Anxiety,fnxmfw6,t1_fnxkqiy,1587341712.0,Haha it’s okay! You should be happy that u don’t

Sometimes I wonder if I will never be a normal healthy person :(( anyways ur reply made my day. We tend to think that everything happening to us is unique and that no one suffers as much as. However, knowing other ppl go through the same is a relief. Thank you so much have a wonderful day❤️"
Anxiety,fnxdz7i,t3_fq8z5a,1587336691.0,Texting is so mentally exhausting to me. It takes so much energy and emotions and I don’t even know why? Even if the convo is silly nothing serious it requires a great effort from me to reply and keep it going. Sometimes I just reply and then exit the app fast and close the notification so I can carry out whatever I was doing without getting anxiety of the messages sent after. It’s like because I can’t see it I won’t feel it
Anxiety,fnxdnlg,t3_fq8z5a,1587336509.0,Same! I’m so happy other ppl feel like me. It’s whenever a convo starts i’m just looking forward to end it. When somebody sends something I normally ignore it and then have extra anxiety about leaving their messages unread for days!
