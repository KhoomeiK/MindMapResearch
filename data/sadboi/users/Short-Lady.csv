NoStupidQuestions,f886a7c,t1_f88659i,1574349309.0,Accepting virtual hugs! And itâ€™s no problem. If I think of more Iâ€™ll edit my post
NoStupidQuestions,f885xvi,t3_dzjydp,1574349147.0,"My Hero Academia, One Piece, Fairy Tail, and Seven Deadly Sins are all good action anime. My Hero Academia and Seven Deadly Sins are on Netflix. Actually Seven Deadly Sins is a Netflix original. And theyâ€™re all dubbed, except Fairy Tail. Some of it is dubbed, but not all of it that Iâ€™m aware of

Avatar: The Last Airbender is definitely amazing. The second series Legend of Korra isnâ€™t as good though

If youâ€™re into mushy romance anime I suggest Clannad. Itâ€™ll make you sad, happy, laugh, cry, excited and even mad. Thereâ€™s even parts that will make your heart jump

If youâ€™re looking for live action stuff, Netflix has a bunch of series. If you donâ€™t have Netflix, then nevermind this. If you do have Netflix I suggest Lucifer. Yes it has to do with the Devil, but itâ€™s a unique take on him and he actually plays a pretty good guy. Warning, it is a crime show so if you arenâ€™t into that then this might not be for you. It does have other angels in it too

Thatâ€™s all I can think of for now, but all of these are my favorite"
