Anxiety,eya3lr1,t3_cw8ahf,1566957642.0,"This used to be my lifestyle (and sometimes it still is). I felt paralyzed and totally out of my mind whenever I had to do any responsibility, specially an exam. I used to do my exams all sweety, with body tremors and permanently thinking that I wouldn't be able to even finish it. I don't know if it's your case, but I got so much better with time, books, meditation, relaxation... My mind changed (and I made it change). Now, when I start feeling overwhelmed about things (also law school, mostly) I just apply one words that my father told me: you don't need to worry about your problems or things to do, you need to take care of them (it's kinda cool because it rhymes in Spanish which is my language) anyway, thinking that everything is bigger in my mind that it actually is helps me a lot, because if you think about it, is it that bad (for example) answering your emails? I mean, picture you in a table with a cup of coffee, typing in your laptop. It's not that bad, it can be boring, difficult or exhausting, but it doesn't need to be that scary. It's not. That anxiety cames from living in that future moment when you're doing that thing that makes you anxious, but just stop living in the future! Present is so much better and suprise, it IS the reality!"

Waking up early is not a problem when you really want the thing you're getting by doing it. Like everything is worth it. I study because I want, not because I have to or because I'm being obligated.

I started college a year ago, I was 24, pretty late you may think. I always wanted to study Law but for the things that happen in life, I never could; but now I can, so I will do everything that is on my hand (at least) to do it. Time is precious."

Actually I don't know if it's that hard, I'm just asking in case I'm missing something (surely I am) about being combination and sill being able to use radiant or glowy effect products without getting out all natural oils from the skin. I think that kind of products aren't made for oily or combination, but I was thinking that it may be a way so these skin types can use them and get good results, that's what I'm asking :)"
