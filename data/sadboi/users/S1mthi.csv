Price range: $15-20k

Lease or Buy: either 

New or used: Used

Type of vehicle: sedan, maybe a subcompact crossover cuv

Must haves: 4 door, nothing else I really ""need,"" but instead want.

Desired transmission (auto/manual, etc): auto 

Intended use: Daily Driver, weekend car

Vehicles you've already considered: Mazda3, Civic Si, etc. I've looked at tons upon tons of newer cars but have barely skimmed the surface of any used ones

Is this your 1st vehicle: yes

Do you need a Warranty: no

Can you do Minor work on your own vehicle: I can learn

Can you do Major work on your own vehicle: no 

Additional Notes: I like mid size sedans, heated and ventilated seats are a plus, along with a heads up display if available. I've always wanted to use Android Auto, which I know is hard to find on older used cars, and nice speakers would be ideal as well."

My DM is deciding between a number of different pre-established realms and settings, such as LOTR, Lovecraftian, Western, Pirates, and Runeterra. 

When he mentioned Runeterra (the League of Legends universe) I couldn't help but think of Diana's lore, who was my main when i used to play league, so I decided to go off of her lore, which is that: 

she questioned the Solari, a sort of sun-based cult/religion of sorts, and left trying to find an answer or resolution for her heretical love for the moon. Basically she finds the long lost moon-based group, Lunari, and is sorta taken over by their ideologies and prior memories, and eventually takes off from the Solari to be by her own, undisturbed by heretical remarks.

That's Diana's lore, so I'm thinking my patron is going to be loosely based off of that. My main idea right now (in a nutshell) is making her the bloodline heir who survived a Solari-Lunari war that wiped out all the Lunari--except for Diana. And with her inherited power, she wants to revitalize the group, and finds my Warlock as a suitable pawn to help her to so.

I did quite a bit of research on patrons, and was down to Selephra and the Witch of Fates, but I couldn't decide because I couldn't find enough information about either of them--I could only find a couple sentences for each.

So now my DM just said to make my own patron and not use one of the 'pre-made' patrons. And I didn't know I could do that so I'm actually quite ecstatic about making my own patron on top of my character, but **my question is:**

Howwastoday,et5fbi4,t3_ca0lfl,1562472223.0,"I haven't replied here in well over a month. I used to do it every day, but stopped once I went on vacation. I got back a couple weeks ago but I still haven't commented here, since I didn't know if there was much to talk about.

But today that changed. Today was a wonderful day for me. Firstly, I finally got around to watching The Office a week or so ago, and I binged that for a few hours. I then went to the movies to see John Wick 3, which I planned with my friend to see the day before, and it was great. We actually had meaningful conversations that weren't just vague mentions of ironic memes. The feeling was immensely and genuinely refreshing. I rarely talk with people, and when I do I get nervous and anxious, but knowing that every once in a blue moon I can actually talk and enjoy my life with a close friend. It really warms my heart.  
 I got home, binged more Netflix, played some xbox with my brother for the first time in years (we usually leave each other alone at home all day), then went out to see another movie, Spiderman: Far From Home,  with my brother. And now I just got home from watching that movie and I'm sitting here finally writing this down on reddit, after a long but simply fun Saturday. 

I've got only seconds left in the day, and writing this down for once has really helped me vent and understand my emotions just a touch more. It's now midnight and I already miss everything that happened yesterday. Moments and days like today really take the edge off of the downward spiral that my meaningless life is going right now. This feeling of euphoria and genuine pleasure is amazing, I hope I can eventually reach a moment in life where more of my days are like this!
