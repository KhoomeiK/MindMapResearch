depression,evhksoc,t3_cjubob,1564527948.0,Having exactly that sort of experience. Was just cruising then mid Sunday just crashed.  I managed a few laughs today but it all comes back quite abruptly and harshly afterwards.
depression,evdl7pf,t3_cjisi5,1564440963.0,"Same here, like it overloaded whatever the hell I feel stuff with and now there is nothing but sadness and excruciating boredom. I hope it doesn’t last long for you."
depression,evdj8fm,t3_cjdfwk,1564439565.0,"Yea, earlier in my head I was thinking of trying to rationalise suicide and de-stigmatise it as some sort of life choice. Like hey everyone I know, I’m bored of this life thing and I’m just not feeling it, so I’m just going to stop it all right now. Like quitting a job or something. Then I realised how dangerous that train of thought is and shook myself out of it."
depression,evdialg,t3_cd0hjp,1564438913.0,"I’m late to this, but I don’t know about everyone else who feels this but do you not feel depression is trying to bring you down and anxiety about losing control and completely crumpling props you up and it leaves you stuck in some horrible tired, stressy equilibrium? I would love to let go and just hide but I am too scared too. Rarely, I will tale a sick day and say I have a migraine and completely veg in front of Netflix until it asks if I’m there, but I just feel guilty and stressed out about it all day. 

Worst thing is being functional just means you get more and more shit thrown at you at work as I get anxious about failure. They must think I am just efficient when actually I just beat myself up internally to get things done and at some point it’ll get too much."
