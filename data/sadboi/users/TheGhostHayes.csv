depression,fi6t1vx,t3_f6qj6n,1582206666.0,"First and foremost, I will say that based on your willingness and interest to receive help you are on a good track!

Now as for what to do, I think it's important that I preface with my own experience. At one point, I was at a university where I had coasted by for 2 years. I was really good at school but a lack of motivation to get out of bed and do basic things eventually caught up. I went home where I was non-functional for a bit but these days a whole year and a half later I have my associate's and I am going to finish pursuing an economics degree.

I don't mean to give an autobiography or anything that isn't the point but what I want you to understand is that I know. I know what it feels like. At the time it felt like just making myself something to eat was a task to be satisfied with for the rest of the day and I would retreat into bed.


So what did I do? I took a pure egoist approach to my life. I concerned myself with only immediate self-interest to draw out motivation. It sounds simple but the truth is it made a huge difference. The act of adding one more action that gave me joy made days bearable until I found that my days had become full and I didn't feel dread starting them. 

Some things were easier to find motivation and others were less gratifying but on those that were lesser I applied a bonus reward to them like a snack. The weird thing is that a huge part of difficulty in finding motivation turned out to be a tendency to indulge in the good aspects of life with no real work towards it. The result of that was an expectation to receive that without an effort. I think it helps significantly to reestablish a definitive means to reward yourself to motivate yourself.


I'm sorry if this wasn't the answer you're looking for. It is tough without a doubt, but you seem willing so I know you'll be able to apply some change. I love you buddy and if you have more questions or want elaboration I'll reply as soon as possible!"
depression,fi3jald,t3_f6amxw,1582120546.0,"My heart aches for you. I can't imagine the pain you must feel.


I will say that this too will pass. It was not him that actualized the change in your life but it was you. It is for that reason that I am confident that a focus on your own growth will return your happiness.


I know it is intuitive to want to see others hurt as you do who have caused you pain but take my word there is no benefit for you in that. The world is a cruel place with people who are selfish. The reality is there are many people who cause harm and never receive justice for their lack of empathy, but it is crucial to understand that it is not your goal to make that happen (or even hope for it really).


It will be rough, but take the small steps to remove the connections you have to them. Looking back at them, believing they easily can move on while you sit hurting is self-destructive. The truth is you don't know how they feel, and you never truly will but you know how you feel and that is hurt. With that, you need to be strong and taper yourself off from your thoughts of them and put thag energy to yourself in any way you can.


Instead of texts from them reach out to friends, instead of holding onto the things you did with them find new things to do for now, instead of thinking of them think of what you are slacking on in your life because that undeserving energy you gave to them can do wonders when applied to yourself!


I hope this has helped, it breaks my heart hearing others suffer through things like this as I once have. You are strong, you are intelligent, and you deserve to feel whole. I love you buddy, don't let anyone take the value of yourself away from you!"

Defend who you want, but I've seen very little to believe that this man is a stand up person. A provoker at the least.

He saw a black kid and called him a criminal. He saw a black kid and followed him armed.  The dude has made a stupid amount of calls to the non-emergency report number, so he can keep his defense that ""I thought they wanted me to follow him"" to himself. The kid is dead, this man is alive and continues to jerk himself off like he is some hero. If he had an ounce of empathy in him he wouldn't taunt the death of an individual like that publicly.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, I do not have the specifics of your situation, but being honest with what makes you happy and unhappy is a skill that is difficult to exercise due to our biases. Our shift away from unhappiness does not happen overnight so don't be discouraged if it feels like none of these changes you apply don't net immediate results. It's a long game of trial and error, but even the small things that stick go a long way. Optimism and open mindedness go a long way.

The consumption of food isn't going to solve my problems, but after that meal I feel better off than I did moments before and I can say I am happier. In the grand scheme, that's how I make life enjoyable, I cherish the victories big or small, because I don't think my enjoyment of something needs to have some meaning behind it.

&#x200B;

Another thing I do is read, specifically about biases. A lot of what we feel and perceive is greatly affected by our cognitive biases, so reading about these and actively working to reduce the altered perception helps significantly. Acknowledging biases and tendencies such as over-generalization, mood congruent memory bias, etc. can give a different perspective to what we see and think when we apply labels to ourselves.

Destiny,f4yjc5p,t1_f4y8ska,1571877802.0,"The problem with the last part ""he tries to work on  his edgy side"" is I think the real issue with all this. I don't think destiny wants to pander to him when he has no real intention of changing any behavior, because he feels he is right.

If he goes on to say this, but it gets out that he makes these same statements as he did before then he is now just deceiving him which is not his intention."
depression,f3wfizd,t1_f3u8mlu,1571200633.0,I'm glad it helps. No one deserves to feel less than they are! Keep it up man your strength is my strength!
depression,f3tbgv2,t3_di3edv,1571126357.0,"Hey, it's ok to cry. As matter of fact, it is better to let it out, because otherwise the weight would come to be unbearable. I'm proud of you, I truly am. It takes a tremendous amount of strength to pull through and get through the day when you are just not feeling it, so you should know who strong you are for those victories. I don't know you're situation nor do I know much about you, but what I will say is that I am rooting for you. I know it's tough and it seems to continue endlessly but that is not true. You will find happiness and you will be relieved, because you have it in you.  All I can really say is put yourself out there and try some new things however insignificant they may seem. A bit of variety goes a long way.

I love you buddy and if you ever need someone to talk to I am always here. I will always respond. I am here fighting this with you!"
depression,f3tb643,t3_dhx2oj,1571125955.0,"Hey buddy, if you ever need to vent there is always someone here to listen. I will always respond to any and all messages. That being said just know that you are not alone. There are many fighting the fight with you and although it may seem like there is a divide between you and everyone else it is not true. You are a beautiful human being and no one deserves to feel less than they are. If the feeling is seemingly insurmountable what i always do is think of something that would bring me any sort of happiness no matter how great or small it is and go out and do that. If it's some ice cream go get some! If it's some fresh air go outside! It won't solve all your problems but it is the step in the right direction you may need,

&#x200B;

I hope this helps because I know how it feels and I would never wish on anyone. You deserve to feel whole and I wish you the best!"

depression_help,f3dz2wt,t1_f3aqyrf,1570851453.0,I hope you'll reconsider. Life is not so black and white.  I'm sure there are things you enjoy now and many more things you will come to enjoy. I love you buddy and I'm here to fight this with you in any way you need.
depression_help,f39488t,t3_dg0hyz,1570743479.0,"Hey buddy, I am proud of your perseverance. I can't imagine the weight you carry around every day, but it says so much that you have worked through this far in life. I just want to say that you aren't alone. Although our circumstances are not exactly the same. I have felt that despair too. I'm sure there are things you enjoy and it is those things that make life worth living. I'm sure you've heard these things for years, but just know  that the feeling of certain misfortune in your future is not sound. 


All that I can recommend that maybe you have not been told after all this time is to read. Read about cognitive biases like selective abstraction and overgeneralization. It may help to actively inform yourself and work against the things that seem to contribute to an all around negative outlook. 

I wish you the best and if you ever need to talk feel free to contact me. I'll always answer."
