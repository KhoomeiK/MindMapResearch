depression,evym658,t3_clue8y,1564935919.0,"I have come to terms with it. It's a simple fact of life now. Every aspect of my life is controlled by someone I no longer love, so suicide is my choice and I am proud of having one thing no one can take away. Any time I want I can take away my own life.  And I will. Just a matter of time."

I deal with it too, I have for years. I don't know your situation but if you have anyone to talk to irl do so. If you don't, I'm here for ya. DM me if you need a talking buddy."
