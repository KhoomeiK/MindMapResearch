mentalhealth,f79qogl,t3_dkxsh8,1573513159.0,I'm surrounded by a lot of happy people who don't know how to respond to my concerns. Or maybe that's an isolating tactic I use to avoid compassion.

nonprofit,f356z38,t1_f31tu5b,1570669972.0,"Hey, thanks! I considered the consulting idea and if I'm asked to expand even further I'll likely use that. Through my research it seems that is a common method nonprofits will use to earn income. For this assignment I've settled on an ancillary school supplies shop which employs the students, giving them work experience and allowing them to earn wages. On top of that they receive guidance on managing personal finances. Sounds pretty good, eh? 
The paper is primarily an examination of UBIT and so I have to determine whether my organization's commercial income will be taxed. I say it's activities fall well within my organization's ""exempt purposes"", so no taxes."

linguisticshumor,eux7cof,t1_euwq69y,1564084179.0,Agreed! I didn't think about that. It's not like da is short for another word.

linguisticshumor,euvvedu,t1_euvocxm,1564066095.0,"But that doesn't quite work. 'Yoda man' is, of course, a play on 'you da man' which is a hip way to say 'you are the man', removing the verb 'are' and replacing 'the' with 'da'. If yoda were to say 'you are the man' he'd say, ""the man, you are"". Yoda always keeps the determiner 'the' before the noun like in normal English syntax. So, if Yoda wanted to sound hip he would presumably try the same technique and come up with, ""da man, yo"". But... That doesn't sit right with me. Passable?
'Man, yo da' translates to 'man, you the', which doesn't make sense either because the determiner 'the' is in the wrong place. 

Tangled, my brain is."

primatology,eumnmqn,t1_eug03vt,1563918088.0,"I had an intern who was working towards her bachelor's in primatology at CWU. She was enjoying it and her goal was to continue work in sanctuaries. I believe she's going to continue on to the master's program there. I don't know a whole lot about the program or the research. Worth a looksie, though."
primatology,eu38stj,t3_c4u9f6,1563408290.0,"You could consider going into the nonprofit realm. A sanctuary or a conservation organization might be a good fit for you as they tend to have a more 'boots on the ground' feel. Getting a master's in solely primatology (my phone doesnt even know the word) doesn't lend you too many options, so I recommend getting further education into conservation or nonprofit management or conservation/welfare law or something instead of or in addition to the primatology degree. 

And of course you should get some type of field experience! It'll expand your own perspective at the very least and it'll be fun! Do it sooner rather than later. You won't regret it. Check this website regularly for field, volunteer, and professional opportunities: http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/jobs/list/avail

Hope this helps!

P.s.
Is the primatology master's you're looking at through Central Washington University?"
