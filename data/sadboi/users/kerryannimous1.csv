unpopularopinion,fl6p55n,t3_fmq46u,1584878618.0,"I (50yr old female) was recently diagnosed with bp2 and complex ptsd.  My biological father also had bipolar disorder.  He left when I was 4 because he felt his mental unhealth (never medicated) would do me more harm than good.   True, however the chaos of my early child hood set the stage for my ptsd.   He was unaware of his psychiatric condition when I was conceived.  My ACE score is at the upper limit, in great part due to his illness.   Because my bipolar and ptsd was diagnosed later in life, I am now permanently disabled.  Untreated bi polar is a progressive disease.   I have 2 teenage children.  Because of my condition during their childhood they witnessed my 2 complete breakdowns that required hospitalization.  In their lifetime they have witnessed me unable to care for them, in bed for weeks on end, witnessed my uncontrolled rage (never directed at them thankfully), witnessed the chaos created when was manic, the chaos that followed my hypersexuality and infidelity to their father.   My 17 year old daughter is showing the same symptoms that I exhibited at her age.  It fucking breaks my heart.   There are times when I have seriously contemplated suicide and it freaks me out.  I struggle between being there for them, and the utter desire to end my unbearable suffering.  
If I had known my condition prior to conception I would have made a different choice.   Don’t misunderstand me:  my children are everything.  I love them more than life itself.  They are the ONLY reason I have not taken my life.  
No one should have an opinion on this question unless they have walked in these shoes.
Folks, the desire to have a baby pulls hard.  Try to imagine the bigger picture.  If you have bipolar disorder you will live dark episodes throughout your life.  This is a fact.  Think about your beautiful future children.  Think about what they will feel when you crash and have to go inpatient.   Think about what will happen if you commit suicide.  Think about how you will feel if you learn that the have BP disorder.  Think hard about all of this.  Then make your decision.  
I am sending love to all my bp brothers and sisters.  You are not alone."
