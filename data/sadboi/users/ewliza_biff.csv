If you’re looking for a simple routine I would recommend a moisturizer like CeraVe’s moisturizing cream, sunscreen (can help w preventing acne scars and it really makes a difference in the skins overall appearance). You could also try exfoliating two or three times a week at night w a gentle chemical like Clinique’s clarifying lotion 1, or the pixie glow tonic. I also like using the neutrogena 2.5% BP spot treatment for breakouts! If you want more hydration try hyaluronic acid. I like the CosRx hydra power essence.

I def wouldn’t use the word appropriation cause they’re just doing what they love and changing gender stereotypes.

It might also be beneficial to add a hyaluronic acid toner after the tret before the moisturizer. I like the COSRX toner w the HA. 

Be careful with the face masks, make sure to use them on nights you aren’t using tret and make sure they’re not drying or irritating your new sensitive skin. I also wouldn’t use any of the glow recipe stuff on tret nights cause those have aha’s. 

Am: SUNSCREEN, your skin will become extra sensitive to the sun! And only add in active ingredients until you get a sense of how your skin handles tret, so like after a couple weeks maybe add a vitamin c serum under your sunscreen or exfoliate!"

In all honesty though idk what exactly is going on because I don’t understand or remember the medical stuff they tell me hahaha but occupational and physical therapy has help me A LOT.

MakeupAddiction,fom7eic,t3_g87y5v,1587880496.0,Less than a year isn’t a long time if it hasn’t been opened. I would guess it just spectated and you need to shake it.
ptsd,fom74s4,t3_g88ucj,1587880260.0,Yeah hahaha being weird like that isn’t just a symptom of ptsd specifically. I mean she could have some mental health problems that give her social anxiety or lack of empathy or whatever she’s like but I wouldn’t think it’s specifically cause she has ptsd.
BodyPositive,fom5ar1,t1_fog1ol3,1587878732.0,"Acknowledging privilege isn’t about how you’re life is overall, it’s acknowledging qualities that haven’t given you disadvantages.  Like youre white and straight, so you don’t have to deal w discrimination based on those two things you can’t control. I mean I think it’s mostly just important when talking about specific topics. Like average sized people are accepted by society, they may feel insecure, but the majority of people look at them and don’t second guess their health or think/say a negative thing about their weight. They don’t understand what it’s like to be discriminated against/feel unworthy because strangers like to comment on their weight or because they’ve been bullied for being fat/too skinny/ whatever that’s not the norm, all their life and treated differently. Just like you don’t know what it’s like to be treated like shit just for being gay or black, your privilege is still that you’re white and straight, nothing wrong w that at all and that doesn’t take away from your having a hard life or what you’ve been through."

tretinoin,folzqhs,t3_g870mr,1587874454.0,Nope. Use at night before you go to bed!
tretinoin,fol7g5w,t3_g82wir,1587856376.0,"No it may irritate your skin in the sun, tret isn’t photostable!"
Makeup,foimf3k,t3_g7nh4o,1587790427.0,"Maybe like a tinted moisturizer? I use bareMinerals tinted gel and I can barely feel it on my face or like an eyebrow gel? I can’t feel it touch my skin! Although I don’t have an intense sensory problem, I do have a tbi that makes me sometimes feel the clothes on my body and it’s quite uncomfortable. I hope you find something that works for you!"
