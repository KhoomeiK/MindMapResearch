PlasticSurgery,fr2xv26,t3_gmdcda,1589846002.0,"Hi all!

I’ve noticed that my nose looks very different from the left and right angle. The bump you see in the first picture, isn’t only bothering me cosmetics wise but also physically. It feels like my nose is crooked which can be painful sometimes, like I got hit in the nose. Also, my sinusitis has been pretty bad but a deviated septum has not been diagnosed. What do you guys think, have any of you had experience with these problems and this appearance of the nose? 

I’m currently waiting for my ENT specialist to make an appointment after the Covid-19 regulations aren’t as strict anymore so a professional take on it is of course in the works."

Also, a good piercer will clean the new jewelry before changing the jewelry in a sterile look environment. I would advise against changing this piercing as if it were a regular earring (at least until the piercer gave the OK that its fully healed now). 

Also, to put less pressure on your ear, I sleep on one of those neck pillows. Helps a lot!
