I flew Aeromexico once from Mexico City to Paris, it was pretty chaotic and we still laugh about it.

The flight attendants got a whole middle row for the 4 of them to sit together. It was at the front of a segment near the bathrooms. Now, early one of the bathrooms went out of service, so people kept walking up the corridor, realizing the bathroom was out, and asking the flight attendants if they could pass (in front of their knees, where they had more legroom than other aisles). Or people would be sitting towards the front and didn't want to walk all the way around and back up. So the flight attendants got pissy and started saying no.

Well this happened last year, so now it's too late to do anything about it. At first the AirBnB person did ask if we had screenshots, but then basically said that we couldn't get refunded because the host was refusing, period. The agreement didn't count for anything. I was extremely frustrated with AirBnB not only because of their stances but because the different reps were contradicting each other and the circularity of the discussions with them.

As for the host, he and his wife were originally very sweet and I think there wouldn't have been an issue with them if we had stayed, but the moving out brought about dishonest behavior. It was in Colombia and it was a hassle to waste so much of my vacation time trying to contact and reason with CS, but I had two other stays that were without any issue. 

And yes, I definitely learned my lesson there about keeping all convos to the AirBnb app - that's an important one. And also about how to cancel, but there also needs to be clearer instructions on the website because we did what it said we should do (and the CS rep agreed). 

Another case where information wasn't readily available happened recently, I booked a place in Paris that had full refunds for cancellations within 48 hours. Before that timeframe, I decided to go with a different place. But, I was afraid that we would end up with nothing, so I first booked a different place, then literally 30 seconds later cancelled the first one. AirBnB kept the service fee, which was supposed to be refunded if done in 48 hours. When I called about it, the rep explained that you can't have 2 bookings at once. That's fine, but it wasn't stated in the cancellation policy, it simply said that within 48 hours you got a full refund (no caveats or other conditions were listed). These things might be totally obvious to those who use the platform often, but it's not to those of us who haven't used it much."

The scamming was when the host moved the convo to WhatsApp and asked that we not cancel officially until the following week because he didn't have money to refund us then.

There were several different issues here, but to clarify again, the host's policy was flexible and it stated that we could cancel at any time and receive a refund for the remainder. If not, we would have simply stayed there. One of the issues was that he messaged us on WhatsApp to say that he didn't have money and would refund us the following week, but then he started disputing it after we had already left. etc etc. The point here isn't to get into the details of the story again but to say that the customer service person assured me we would get a refund, and then we didn't, and also continuously basically said ""yes you did what the website says you should do, BUT you could have done this other thing that's not mentioned anywhere""."
AirBnB,fkgzezy,t3_fibq1u,1584181917.0,"So last year I stayed somewhere where the host had a flexible cancellation policy. We decided to leave early, which his policy allowed. You just needed to give 24 hrs notice and the rest of your stay was refunded. I looked up how to do it and found - on the airbnb website - that you needed to do a ""cancellation request"". So I did that. The host said he didn't have money, that it was ok for us to leave but we would get refunded the next week. We stupidly agreed and didn't press for him to accept the cancelation. 

After a week, after we had already left, he started arguing and saying we didn't have a good reason to leave. This lasted a few days before I reached out to Airbnb. 

They told me that I just needed to ""cancel"" instead of ""request cancel"" (don't remember the wording but basically that we didn't need the host to do anything on their end). They said we would automatically get refunded for the remaining days, and the rep assured me that we would also get a separate refund for the days that were already passed. 

Well, after that they refused to give us the latter refund because the host refused, even though they had already promised it. And they kept saying that I should have just ""canceled"" instead of doing the request thing. I showed them that I did exactly what they instructed on their website. The guy said ""yes true, but you should have done this other thing instead"". It's very dishonest."

This is something I've never understood. Do you just go around with a wet butt? And people don't find that uncomfortable? Or do you still use something after to dry yourself?"
Switzerland,fkgsaa1,t1_fkfjqwr,1584171865.0,There are other bans and closures that are for less time.
travel,fkfdsf1,t3_fi6bab,1584132197.0,"Imo, you don't need to get on the flight. Just don't go, then do a chargeback on your card and provide proof that you tried to contact them. 

I have been having a comparable problem with British Airways. I had a credit I could use until a certain date, I emailed (as instructed) and called a million times and never got through. After the date passed I still tried for a bit, but now I gave up and will take them to small claims court. Not sure it's a good idea but the best one I have."

Switzerland,fkf3fud,t3_fi291h,1584126263.0,My gym is closing starting tomorrow until April 30. I was surprised they'd plan to shut for that long. Is the crisis starting to look more long-term?
AirBnB,fkep45r,t1_fkefdiq,1584117770.0,"I mean this makes sense too. It's not the host's fault anymore than the guest's, and when people choose a place they know what the cancellation policy is and that there is always risk. I think it should be much easier to get refunds when there is a problem with the place and/or host, but this is a different situation. It's AirBnB's responsibility to people who use their platform - both hosts and guests - to step in and cover at least some of the costs."
travel,fkemjlc,t3_esruar,1584116269.0,"I am in Switzerland and I live in San Francisco. My original plan was to go on a vacation (Thailand or Egypt) towards the end of March before heading home. Now it seems like a bad idea, I am especially worried of being quarantined on arrival. So now it seems best that I either fly to SF directly or stay in Switzerland a while longer. However both of those things are inconvenient as the situation in SF seems pretty bad and Switzerland is inconvenient for personal reasons (including costs).

I was also planning on flying to South America around early June, so I guess I could skip going home and go directly, but that might also be risky.

I guess, what's the wisest? Just try to get a flight to SF and wait it out?"
AirBnB,fkdmnqx,t1_fkcqr80,1584085098.0,"And I agreed with you that the odds are probably better to get a good host, but stated that IF you end up with a bad one, it's too costly in terms of time and money.

And of course, when I guest is wronged and tries to address it, they become ""difficult"". Basically AirBnB is a platform that gives a bunch of entitled brats with no experience running a business the ability to play hotel and screw over who they want. Bravo."
AirBnB,fkccehw,t1_fkc9rnk,1584050138.0,"1. As stated earlier, the last place I rented was with a superhost, and he was terrible. Ergo, booking with a superhost does not avoid problems.
2. The situation of the internet and leaving the apartment was a different instance, and the point of that story (again, try to read more carefully so I don't keep retyping things) was that hosts might seem great and get good ratings, until problems happen and they show a different side. In this case, you don't know what happened, as all I said was that he screwed us over, yet you jump to the conclusion that we were unreasonable guests and that my statement was false. Quite the bias there.
3. In this instance, the original reason for leaving is not the problem, though you are incorrect: the internet was misportrayed and my friend teaches online and needs video. But that is neither here nor there because the host had a flexible cancellation where we could cancel at any point for any reason, giving a 24 hour notice if I remember correctly. We said we wanted to leave on a given date (three days later) and he agreed, but said that they couldn't refund us then because they didn't have the money, but if they accepted our cancelation request on the website they would have to do a refund immediately. We agreed to trust them and wait a week for them to pay us back... without getting into all the back and forth when we asked them ""hey about that refund?..."" they refused to pay or to accept the cancelation and started arguing about the internet being ok. Which, a. if they had wanted to argue about it, they should have done it before agreeing to our cancelation, as we had already moved out, and b. we were entitled to leave for any reason. Maybe not the best, but still within his policy.

Edit: Obviously we were stupid for being trusting in this situation but we really felt bad that they said they didn't have money yet and needed a week, so we though we were being nice when we were really being naive. But that doesn't change the fact that the host acted unethically and hung on to a chunk of our money and customer service was horrible to deal with."
AirBnB,fkc93q3,t1_fkc85in,1584048236.0,"I don't doubt there are great hosts, and you might be right that they are more numerous than the bad ones, but if you do get a bad one man is it extremely time-consuming and difficult to deal with it. 

But also, in regards to whether hosts are generally good or not... what I mean is that it also depends on what situation arrises. I stayed at an apartment where we ended up leaving because my roommate needed better internet for her job and we found a small hotel that she liked much better regardless. 

We ended up getting totally screwed over by the host and airbnb didn't help at all, talking with them was a lot of wasted time and incredibly nerve-wracking. But if this situation hadn't arisen and we had stayed there, I would never had known what this host would pull in that sort of situation. He was otherwise very nice, the place was great, etc, and I would have given him 5 stars."
AirBnB,fkc7xkt,t1_fkc7gqx,1584047560.0,"The last place I rented was with a superhost and he was absolutely terrible. Some of these people probably get good ratings because many guests don't have any problems, but if you're unlucky and there are problems during your stay (ex: shower drain didn't work) host acts like an asshole."
AirBnB,fkbidfw,t3_fh9vrw,1584033549.0,"With the time spent on dealing with hosts and customer service, plus often not getting refunds on subpar places, it ends up being more cost-efficient to just go to a hotel."
