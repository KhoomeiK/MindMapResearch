there is strong evidence for medication, but leading psychiatrists on BD also say extensive therapy is equally essential. 

normies think meds are magic, that ""solving"" the ""problem"" is a matter of flicking a switch, or in this case popping a pill. The fact most people don't understand the struggle involved.

If your therapist isn't buying it, just avoid the topic altogether and focus on personal issues. another option is to discuss your feelings towards the Bd2 diagnosis, why it sits with you on an emotional level. i personally believe there are psychological reasons behind our behaviors (that are expressed more acutely for bipolar) and therapy is the appropriate way to face them."

Death threats aren't uncommon, but you should definitely talk to him about it later. Any response other than remorse is a concerning sign. To diffuse the situation as it's happening, asking them to clarify what they want is a place to start.

Next, it would be wise to try and see this from your husband's perspective. From my perspective, he felt he needed to keep this secret from you. He thinks, because of his disorder, he can't be love, that he doesn't deserve a relationship. So in order to begin this relationship, he felt he needed to hide his bipolar from you, and from himself. 

Now the secret is out, if you then push him away, it would confirm his belief that his condition is a barrier to relationship and happiness. 

If however you choose to accept him with his condition, and come to understand why he hid this from you, it becomes possible to develop a more trusting and more loving relationship. 

Malice is not a trait of bipolar. I do not think he kept this secret out of hard feelings towards you. A common trait of bipolar prior to treatment is denial, and I suspect this was what lies behind this secret. 

Its understandable that you feel betrayed because he kept this from you. But the feelings I would explore hereon is your husband's feelings about himself and who he is."

I also guess that others here have families or a demanding job that they find difficulty balancing with their NEED to daydream. for me, i'm jobless and single (yay?) so i can daydream all day and no one's effected by my absence. 

using me as an example, being satisfied with life despite my derelict real-life, can lead to problems if it can't be considered already a problem (I likely will be homeless a decade from now if i don't change).

these are negative thoughts that compound your low moods. You probably know this, and as you've been through it before, probably know how to combat these thoughts. step outside yourself, think what thoughts oppose these negative ideas. it's basic CBT (are you familiar with this?).

it may take time before you allow yourself to be honest to your T. give yourself time. try just talking, and don't rush yourself in divulging everything at once. i'm sure your therapist will be happy to get to know you, more than just as patient #123."
