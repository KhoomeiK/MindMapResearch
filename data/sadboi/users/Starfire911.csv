Because they usually don‚Äôt do this operation on younger females my age because the surgery can mess up if you decide to get pregnant later in life. I have a rare genetic disorder which effects my female organs and I‚Äôve been told at a young age (preteen) I couldn‚Äôt have kids. Which to me is fine I don‚Äôt want kids.

Everything went well but one part, since I was never under the knife I didn‚Äôt know I was sensitive to anesthesia, and when I went home (which was the same day) I tried to use the bathroom (I had to pee) and I remember sitting  on the toilet crying because I literally could not get anything out , so I made a emergency visit to my urologist who put me on a catheter for a week so I could use the bathroom. I still have problems with my bladder to this day , I‚Äôve been on medication for it , and one of them almost sent me into kidney failure. But I dodged a bullet there. I have a sensitive system and have to be extra careful. One thing that happened was kinda weird , after I had the surgery I would still get phantom pains near where my gallbladder used to be , it wasn‚Äôt as painful and went away fast but just something to throw out there, I hope all goes well!"
