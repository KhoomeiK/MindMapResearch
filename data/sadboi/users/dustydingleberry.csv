slpGradSchool,foodu4y,t1_fnkuvn2,1587937204.0,"Wow this all sounds too familiar!!! Same thing happened to my the first time I applied to grad school. I asked the principal of a school I had an externship at if she would write me a letter of rec and she was all for it! I had to keep reminding her about it. Finally, the day before the applications were due I texted her and she kept saying “oh sorry ill do it” ... later that day there was still nothing. I texted her again that night saying her submission wasn’t showing on my application and she said she “thought she submitted it” and that she’ll check again. She ignored my texts for the rest of the night knowing how I needed her letter to send in my apps and she never checked in with me to see if it was there because she obviously didn’t do it. I STILL NEEDED 1 MORE LETTER AND WAS FREAKING OUT.. DEVASTATED!!! Applications were already so stressful for me and this was the icing on the cake. This was the weirdest experience I’ve ever had with a “professional,” especially someone who worked in a school... you’d think she’d at least tell me she couldn’t do it for whatever made up reason. Anyway, I ended up getting a letter from an advisor of mine from high school and I didn’t get into any of the schools I applied to lmao I KNOW WHAT A SHITTY ENDING TO THE STORY... HOWEVER, second time I applied, I got all 3 letters from amazing professors, I got into my dream school, and I got a scholarship that is paying half my tuition and supporting me getting a certificate in ASD too. Things happen for a reason, I swear!"
