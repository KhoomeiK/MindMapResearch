I had little to no friends. Home life was shit. I made my first friend at 22. First healthy relationship at 23. It took me a long time to figure out how to be the person I want and I am still struggling with it. I am 30 now, still with the same person that I was with at 23, we live in NYC in a beautiful apartment and we work 3 days a week. The other 4, we do whatever we want. I see a doctor every week to help me be the person I want to be. What I am trying to say is, if you want to be a certain person--be it! If your childhood is stopping you from BECOMING a healthy adult, guess what? THAT'S EVERYONE! You're one step ahead because you see that you'd like to change for the better. Shit humans do not do that!! Keep moving forward and make steps, you'll get there. You're lucky, some people never see that their childhood affects them, you are young and able to make some real changes. I would start with mapping out the person you want to be then how to be that person. After that comes the action part. If you feel the need, see a (good) doctor to help you through anxiety and social tendencies.
