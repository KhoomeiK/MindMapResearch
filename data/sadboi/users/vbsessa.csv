I've been taking Parnate 20mg/d for about a month now and just got it raised to 30mg/d. I don't think my doctor will let me go further this dose, but till now i haven't felt nothing, just the side effects, which are mild and tolerable."

Yes, TRT is a life time commitment but where i live most doctor prefer using Nebido, i think due to its practicality. He mentioned anything about hCG together?"

I've been struggling with anxiety and depresson for a long time but its hard to tell whether the reason is the low T, as this kind of mental illness runs in my family. Doctors that i've told about a possible relationship between my mental health and low T just shake their heads, mumbles and says it's not it.

I'll just wait all this clomiphene stuff ends, see what goes on the appointment and, if he doesn't mention TRT, switch doctors."
