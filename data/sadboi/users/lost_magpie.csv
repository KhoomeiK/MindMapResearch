Being pulseless, or cardiac arrest, is not the same thing as asystole. If the electrical impulses are completely gone, which is called asystole, the AED can't revive them. That's usually what you see in movies as flatlining. That is not a shockable rhythm and you can't bring a patient back from that. But, if the heart is in a rhythm like ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia, (it'll look like chaotic squiggles on the ECG) the AED will shock them to correct the ineffective rhythm because the electrical impulses are still intact, they're just going haywire. Essentially an AED stops the electrical impulses in the heart to allow the sinus node to pick up the correct rhythm again. It's like a hard reset."

Albuquerque,foz0yt8,t1_foyz2os,1588182798.0,"I honestly think the dog world can climb in costs because of the ""boutique"" goods aspect. Livestock, including horses, don't really suffer from that phenomenon. The labor aspect is no joke for sure haha. I think like any other hobby, you can pour thousands into it to get the fanciest shit money can buy, but it doesn't have to be like that. You can do it on a fairly small budget. I've had horses since I was a kid and always busted my ass for it. I bought my horse as a teenager by working for the breeding farm for 2 summers straight to pay for him. And after that I found boarding barns I could do labor trades at to keep costs affordable. I usually ended up paying about $75 a month after my labor was deducted. Honestly the reason boarding seems so cheap is because they usually pay stall cleaners like 10 bucks per stall lol, so there isn't a huge overhead of labor costs. The biggest cost gamble is probably hay because the scarcity and quality can vary depending on the season and time of year. We are lucky enough now to have a hay guy who stores hay for us through winter so we don't have any price fluctuations and it's consistent quality. I'm also lucky enough to have received a good education in horses as a teen, so I can do things myself like give vaccines, treat minor wounds, etc. And my wife is a farrier so we save a lot of money there."

Albuquerque,fop63t1,t1_foo5ewq,1587953908.0,"Horses aren't as obscenely as expensive as you might imagine. These are drafts so their feed bill is going to be a bit bigger than your average sized horse, but it really isn't as astronomical as you might imagine. I used to actually board my horse on the same street as where the mounted patrol horses are kept, and I paid about $250 a month including all the food and care and labor. 

From what I understand, the purpose of mounted patrol is crowd control, canvassing in harder to reach areas, and also public outreach. As a mounted patrol officer explained to me, a mounted unit can move slowly and meticulously through tighter areas, which causes them to be able to notice more than if they were cruising by in a car at 30mph. They also are used for public outreach and PR, which we all know police in general need desperately. Draft horses are also particularly effective at crowd control and they're taught to push into people using their chest. There's no way someone is going to outmuscle a horse of this size."

news,fonaxkv,t1_fomtfz2,1587915939.0,"Yep, that's the definition,  thanks for that. Barrel racing has absolutely nothing to do with traditional racing and they are barely even similar. The only thing they have in common is that it's a timed event. Just because it's a timed event doesn't mean it's cruel or rife with abuse like traditional racing. A barrel pattern takes less than 20 seconds, isn't ridden on 2 year olds, typically the horses aren't high dollar investments owned by corporations, they're ridden by their owners. They are so different from each other they're on completely opposite ends of the spectrum and they shouldn't even be compared at all."

news,foma72p,t1_folu4gn,1587882994.0,"So... breaking an ""ankle"" in a horse is typically deadly. It's not that horses are euthanized when they break a leg because they just aren't worth the effort or are damaged goods or something. It's because they cannot live on 3 legs and breaks typically cannot heal. The way a horse's leg is constructed means it can't bear the added weight from the broken leg for an extended period of time and the other 3 feet will founder, which is an extremely painful condition and often deadly in its own right. Euthanasia when a limb is broken is the only thing that can be done."

I was having a pretty low time in my life. My wife had gotten a job in another state but I was in the middle of a technical trade program and couldn't go, so she had to move without me while I finished school. I already struggle with depression during the best of times and this was really hard on me. Working 50 plus hours a week and night school on top of it was sucking every ounce of energy I had, plus feeling sad and alone, was really taking its toll. 

Halloween is my favorite holiday and I made plans with my friend to get dressed up in costumes and go out on the town. It kept me going for weeks looking forward to this, and I'd told her as much multiple times. Then the night of, after I'd already gotten my makeup on and everything, she said she was just tired and didn't want to go out. I tried to explain to her how much the night had meant to me and how I'd been looking forward to it, but she wouldn't relent. I was pretty crushed. I felt completely alone and the lowest I'd felt in YEARS. For the first time in a long time I hit a low enough point that I felt suicidal.
