Dairy is included in there, so you may want to look into other ways to get your iodine if you want to test it.

If you have certain foods that you‚Äôre suspicious of as being triggers for you, maybe just do an elimination test on your own, similar to the FODMAP method of slow reintroduction. I removed gluten for about 6 months and noticed changes without even having to ‚Äútest‚Äù it. But I still tested anyway to confirm that it did affect me."

I suppose it‚Äôs technically a furlough because we have no work until large social gatherings are permitted again, but the company is reopening as soon as the opportunity arises, and bringing back all employees who were on payroll before (only about 30 of us). I work for a very small company that makes items for large corporate events, social gatherings, etc, so as long as events and gatherings are banned, we literally have no work (even part-time).

Thanks for also answering the question I had (but forgot to ask) that I‚Äôll still need to certify every week for the claim to stay open.

My only concern in taking the PPP from them, is that I‚Äôm still searching for better job opportunities (crazy to think that‚Äôs even a possibility right now, I know). So I would feel awful if in a few weeks, after collecting a check from them for doing nothing, I turned around and put in my notice.
