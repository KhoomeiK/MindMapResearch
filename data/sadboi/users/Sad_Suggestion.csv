SuicideWatch,fdyz1pv,t3_enakk8,1578785004.0,"Yes, though it helps to have a date in mind. I like being able to count down to the final day because it gives me something to focus on as well as a deadline to get everything in order."
AskReddit,fdlnnsb,t3_elq6wb,1578528144.0,Had a crush on this guy and thought I would impress him by singing to him in the middle of the hallway while in the 9th grade. Needless to say it did not end well.
SuicideWatch,fcpchpt,t3_eiejla,1577858234.0,"While it is not something people like to hear, it isn't your job to help everyone. That includes your gf. It is understandable that you hurt due to the break up. There may have been a way you can help her through these times but that isn't a guarantee. Instead of that focus on the things you do have some or total control over.  Like the fact that you stood up to someone who is  clearly very toxic all the while protecting your loved ones. You did such a good job. Who cares that you had to make up a thing lie about a bible verse. Apparently they weren't smart enough to catch that. Thus proving your point. Focus on you and allow her to focus on themselves. In the end things may be better for it."
TeamFourStar,fcpbz6o,t1_fcmwm5b,1577857683.0,Well that is something I am going to spend a lot of time and money trying to erase from my memory bank.
SuicideWatch,fcpbtzi,t1_fcp5j05,1577857534.0,"Yea, it is really sad to because people truly do need the help yet hospitals aren't cutting it. Especially since most american insurance companies will only pay for a 3-5 day stay. Making it so people have to leave with truly getting the help they need. It is one huge lie."
SuicideWatch,fcpbop6,t3_ei3ysm,1577857383.0,"I have had some good conversations as well as some terrible ones. I think the problem is that they must stick to their script which often times leads them into sounding overly condescending even though they do not want to. Really, I only use them when it is really late at night and I have no one else to talk to."

SuicideWatch,f8qtga5,t3_e1je3b,1574723804.0,"My daughter and the fact that I may fail. As a parent people have this assumption that children should be enough but it doesn't work like that. For me, my little one is enough,  but not in the way others may be thinking."
SuicideWatch,f8qt8ne,t1_f8pptuw,1574723657.0,Same. Failing means dealing with people constantly watching me. Some will pretend to care while others will go out if their way to be cruel. I am afraid of having to deal with all that and being to scared to try again.
SuicideWatch,f8nuiny,t3_e13iuv,1574653290.0,"I do not think that you have to go into great detail. As someone said, telling them that he was sick and died from said illness is fairly close to the truth. They do not need to know how he died but giving them that bit of information gives them some answers to how he died. He was sick, the end. From there it would probably be best to talk to a specialist just in case the oldest of the two has a better understanding. Not sure when children really start to take notice of things that lead to such attempts but she may have seen the signs.  That will help her later in life when the truth eventually comes out. Because there will be a day when they will figure out what truly happened. So teaching them coping skills while they are young would be very helpful for when that day comes."
SuicideWatch,f8ns9im,t3_e13v6m,1574651648.0,"This is something I think about as well. So in that, you are not alone. It is bothersome really to think of how one's family would react when the person themselves is the one who is struggling. Still, maybe, in this case, it might help to talk to them. You are going to counseling soon. Make it a goal to see how that will go. I am not going to lie and say that it will automatically fix everything but you never know till you try. If you can't do it for you then find someone else to do it for. Tell yourself that it will help in the long run if you give this chance to your bf to go to therapy and stick it out. Find a goal to take you one day at a time. Heck, find a movie that interest you but isn't coming out till next year. Focus on that and keep on doing so. Just one day at a time ok."
