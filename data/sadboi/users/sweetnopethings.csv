Our ""talks""  were the same 5-10 sentences on loop for hours.  Him talking, ramping himself up, then screaming because he knew I was too smart to believe the bullshit, so he'd have to get the fear back into me.  Done with him for about 10 years now, and I look back and can't even remember *enjoying* a bit of time with him.

The day after an increase I'm in bed  the whole day. When I first started it was 25mg, with another 25mg increase until I was at 100mg. I've been at 100 for a couple months.   It helped with the weakness on my left side, I was able to stop using a cane after a full month of use.   I was able to work 2 full days a week without total fatigue.  The actual headache and vision issues never left, but I was happy with being able to get out of bed.  I am bipolar and after 2 months I was getting very manic.  They had to lower my anti depressant because the nortriptyline and effexor together was too much to keep balanced with the seroquel. I was much better about a week after that change.  I have started losing feeling in my hands again, and my arm tremors have started getting worse in the day time, that's why he increased the nortriptyline yesterday.  Trying the botox because tizanadine isn't enough to relax the muscles in my neck. I also take 1800mg of gabapentin a day.  If I didn't touch on something you want to know, please ask me all you want.

mentalillness,fhraf1l,t3_f48f3a,1581821323.0,"There couple things that I need in a therapist.  I am very distrusting of females (narc mom).  I prefer talking with a man.  I just feel more at ease. So, might be something to think about.  I also check reviews.  I don't care much about their opinion of the different therapists, you can be mismatched sometimes, and some people have different expectations.  What I really hate is a long wait time.  I have a hard time with other physical ailments.  So thats something I look for in the referrals.  I love to just go and blab everything I feel like getting off my chest the day I go for therapy.  It's someone that has an outside view and no emotional attatchment to you. I had to get a new therapist this year and he didn't get to say anything the first three visits. I just needed to spew all my frustrations with people.  After that he saw some consistency in what problems I was having and was able to start helping with my coping mechanisms. With my trust issues, I don't confide some things to any friends or family because people can turn on you.  I hope you find someone to unleash your thoughts to. If you don't feel comfortable with one, please try more until you can talk freely.  I wish you all the best in your journey."
confessions,fhgfi9i,t3_f2svb9,1581565794.0,"I have 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, and 10 of your symptoms.   It started June last year, and didn't get it figured out until December.  I was sobbing in my second opinion Neurologist's office.  I told him I need answers, or I'm throwing in the towel.  I could not live like that much longer.   After 2 hospital stays for a week at a time for steroids and a week in the mental ward (first neuro thought I needed drugs for anxiety daily, major chemical imbalance), I was losing hope.  New neuro specializes in MS and migraines.  I have full body migraines( Please look up the symptoms of this), the headaches are just one of a long list of body symptoms.  I have them all the time.  It's like a whole cycle that just repeats over and over. Now the bubbly, wet ear problem. When stuck in the hospital the first time, I mentioned that my ear was bothering me.  It's bothered me for years. So he had an ENT come look at it and the Ent ordered a cat scan, then MRI.  My mastoid bone was very infected. It had to come out.  The sound my ear constantly made was like a bunch of little bubbles popping.   I'm now 8 months in, and on an upswing.  I'd say I'm about a third of the way back to who I once was, but neuro can only implement or change one drug at a time. Might not be anywhere near what you have going on, but wanted to share in case.  Feel free to private message if you have any questions about other symptoms or treatments.   I really hope you get answers, and that you come through all of this well."

mentalillness,ffgfq7w,t3_etfjx2,1579905213.0,"Since you like to write, I would definitely start a journal.  Keep track daily of your mood and write down your triggers.  Also, my therapist told me to make sure I track the good days, and what made them good.  Figuring out your triggers can be a big help.  It may be toxic people in your life that need to go, certain places, crowds...

I'm 42 and have suffered since I was 8. My ladt suicide attempt was at 26. I had some major medical issues this year and got in that downward spiral. I could feel the darkness overtaking me, so I went into the hospital voluntarily.  I spent a week there getting my meds right and honestly relaxing. It was very nice to not have a phone always going off. The group therapies everyday helped me to see that I wasn't alone in my feelings, and learn how other people cope healthily.  I then did 3 weeks outpatient with group therapy and classes on coping mechanisms. 

I wish I would've searched for help earlier in life.  I taught myself the only thing i could ever count on was pain.  I lived too long in this mindset and is very hard to get away from the battle in mt head.  I have an amazing husband now, but I still struggle with feeling worthy of his love.   

I wish you all the best.  I hope you know you're worthy of love and that includes you loving you.  If you ever need someone to talk to, please reach out to me, or reddit in general. So many of us have mental issues, and will gladly talk with people in need of being heard."

New neuro that specializes in ms and migraine put me on nortryptaline. After 6 weeks I'm finally able to get back to work and leave the bed.   All my body symptoms are gone, but still have headaches and blurred/ double vision.

That this can effect the blood and cause weakness on one side of the body, brain fog. Also I have other problems like bi polar, and arthritis. I just know that I have found hope with this one.

AskReddit,f44lm4r,t3_djabmx,1571354706.0,"Drank from 13 to 37. 4 years sober. Used it as a crutch. It was something I couldn't wait to get home to do. So much happier, and finally facing my demons in therapy."
raisedbynarcissists,f4390mz,t1_f42wdrg,1571339631.0,"Thank you!  I hate the racism. My ex husband is Arab, and she'll trash Arabs. You have a grandson who is his son. I married that man, so obviously I don't share your backwards views of judging people over race. Ugh, just a walking reminder of who I never wanted to be."
raisedbynarcissists,f4372fa,t1_f42f4ay,1571339133.0,"Thank you so much!  Some people don't get it, because she doesn't say all the little things that add up around other people.  She talks different around me alone than anyone else."
toastme,f425mpb,t3_dj752e,1571327753.0,"You're beautiful!!! Congratulations on getting help. I was inpatient in August and did three weeks outpatient. Take in all they have to teach and use those coping mechanisms girl!  Especially the quick easy breathing techniques that you can remember on the spot. You can do this. And don't forget to take your meds. The lil weekly day and night tray things can really help if you're bad at this, and set alarms on your phone. You also DESERVE you time. EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Even a half hour of decompress time. You can't give if you have nothing left. You really do have a gorgeous smile and beautiful eyes!"
raisedbynarcissists,f41k3s6,t1_f41irk8,1571320367.0,"The energy it took prepping to see her and winding down from seeing her was too much.  Even for a ""normal"" encounter. It was getting to the point where I was visibly shaking when I was getting ready to see her. My husband couldn't stand it. Since NC, I have felt so relaxed, all the time. Except the nightmares. I didn't have one after having therapy yesterday."
raisedbynarcissists,f41iasu,t1_f41faeb,1571319742.0,"I luckily come from a divorced household and have a dad and stepmom who loved me like crazy who I saw on the weekends. So I saw the normal life. It made it really hard to go back during the week! I moved in with my dad at 13, but she still managed to make everything hurt without being there. It really is Huge what they do!"
toastme,f2lwv5m,t3_ddlhs0,1570299061.0,"You remind me A LOT of my brother. Very dark handsome features. He started balding at 22 I think. He did the baseball cap for a long time. Then decided to just shave his head. Think Jason Stathem. I think you look like you have a nice shaped head and could pull off a shaved head. Keep the beard. Keep your confidence! That's all women care about. I'm 41, married now, but dated men who had all different kinds of hair. I promise, personality matters more than anything."

AskReddit,f1rvsks,t1_f1raa7v,1569720820.0,"As a woman I will confirm that it is something intimate that I can show off for my husband that instantly brings him joy. He says it could be a million times seeing them and each time it would be like the first time. I love that random flashes or just grabbing his head and having him motorboat me will have us laughing like teenagers. Nothing wrong with adults acting playful. I love that he enjoys looking at me naked, he makes me feel like a goddess."

It helps to not feel alone in these things, and to know that no matter the age, I shouldn't feel like I should be old enough to just be past it."
