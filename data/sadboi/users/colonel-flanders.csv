I can completely empathize with the insidiousness of the depression you‚Äôve likely been experiencing. You don‚Äôt even realize it in the moment that you‚Äôve become a shell of your former self. Only after you‚Äôve made it through do you look back and say ‚Äúmy god, how did I not see it?‚Äù So first, I want you to be kind to yourself and understand that no matter what happens you will absolutely be ok in the end.

From your partner‚Äôs perspective, I know how difficult it is to want to have better communication with the person you love but no matter how hard you try you can‚Äôt seem to break through their walls. If your partner is convinced that he needs to leave then ultimately you have to respect that, but before he goes I think you need to be really vulnerable with him. It may not work, frankly it didn‚Äôt work for me, but I still think it was the right move and that‚Äôs what I suggest. Be vulnerable, try your best to explain what you‚Äôve been going through and why you‚Äôve been avoidant. Maybe you‚Äôve been so overwhelmed, maybe you‚Äôve been afraid to admit you‚Äôve been struggling, I don‚Äôt know, only you do. But talk to him and try your best if it‚Äôs worth fighting for.

datingoverthirty,ffe47o1,t1_ffdzfiv,1579836263.0,"I think that‚Äôs really the more common approach.. it‚Äôs nothing against people who have a friendship with an ex, my ex remained friends with one of her exes cuz they were part of a larger friend group.. I didn‚Äôt like it per se but life‚Äôs not perfect and she didn‚Äôt really give me a reason not to trust her.. but, for me, I know how much emotional effort I put into a relationship and how much it takes to get over a failed relationship so I just don‚Äôt see being pals as a realistic option.. especially if someone new is in the picture, it feels like I‚Äôm not giving the new person my undivided attention.. I‚Äôll inevitably have old feelings start to surface, whether I want them to or not, and I‚Äôll end up confused which isn‚Äôt fair to the new budding relationship.. I‚Äôm willing to hear out a potential partner‚Äôs thought process if we disagree on this but I really think my approach is better in the long run if it‚Äôs possible (again, totally different from your situation)"
