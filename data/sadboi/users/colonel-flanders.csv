Sorry for the less than ideal answer, just trying to be honest. Maybe your partner will be better irl and maybe that’ll be good enough for you.

I can completely empathize with the insidiousness of the depression you’ve likely been experiencing. You don’t even realize it in the moment that you’ve become a shell of your former self. Only after you’ve made it through do you look back and say “my god, how did I not see it?” So first, I want you to be kind to yourself and understand that no matter what happens you will absolutely be ok in the end.

From your partner’s perspective, I know how difficult it is to want to have better communication with the person you love but no matter how hard you try you can’t seem to break through their walls. If your partner is convinced that he needs to leave then ultimately you have to respect that, but before he goes I think you need to be really vulnerable with him. It may not work, frankly it didn’t work for me, but I still think it was the right move and that’s what I suggest. Be vulnerable, try your best to explain what you’ve been going through and why you’ve been avoidant. Maybe you’ve been so overwhelmed, maybe you’ve been afraid to admit you’ve been struggling, I don’t know, only you do. But talk to him and try your best if it’s worth fighting for.
