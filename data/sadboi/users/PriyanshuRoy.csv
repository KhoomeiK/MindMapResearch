No other lie is as common as this one.
Try to reach out, they'll say you crave pity. They call you lazy and will say that your future is bleak.

This might be true at some places, where people matter, but in heavily populated countries like India, where humans are like insects; extremely abundant, mental health doesn't matter. Once you go down the hole, nobody is going to even throw down a rope, if not reach out their hand.

Also, I think that Jaiden has made a few videos about her problems, but not about how she sought help and stuff. Do you think it would be a good idea for her to make a video on that? We would have a temporary change of pace from light-hearted videos to more serious ones. Also, we could say 'sike' to people who say that Jaiden can't make serious videos anymore."

unpopularopinion,fno2zlc,t3_g16ilp,1587110180.0,"Religion is just a big franchise,like others.

I know this could be pretty controversial,but that's what this subreddit exists for.

Just like we have big franchises like Marvel,Transformers,Game of Thrones,Star Wars etc,religion is also a big franchise,albeit a pretty ancient one.

Most franchises have core books,movies and stuff. Religion too has such core books,like Bible for Christians,Quran for Muslims and Bhagvada Gita for Hindus(not so sure about the Hindus). 

Just like Star Wars has some pretty well known characters like Darth Vader or Luke Skywalker,religions too have a few 'big guys' , like Jesus for Christians,Allah for Muslims and so on. 

Just like fans of a franchise, religion too has 'fans',who we call followers. Just like people write fanfiction and draw fanart,religion too has 'fanfiction' ( stories written by authors with religious themes,or stories where some god is involved) and fanart (for example,those guys who drew Jesus,or those guys who drew the Hindu  gods).
           Clashes between religions look like fandom wars to me. Just like FORCING your favourite franchise on someone is rude,so is religion. 
 
Tldr- I think religion is just a well developed franchise. Well developed,but still a franchise. Though it has some good philosophical ideas,many well known franchises have such ideas too,sometimes even better ones. Thus,it's nothing special."

I believe that special rights for women should only be for the things unique to them,things which are forced upon them by nature,like menstruation and stuff. Pregnancy is not a part of it. It's mostly THEIR choice. Those rights should not encroach basic human rights.However,they should not have rights which makes them the 'better sex'. We are aiming for equality,not 'domination over men'.

I have seen that many women INTENTIONALLY bash men,just because they are misandrists,and use feminism as cover.

The very fact that people consider 'not hitting women' a good thing shows that the idea of women being 'the weaker sex' hasn't gone away. If we want equality,we should not forget that being humans,they should be equally prone to being punched for being a**holes.

If they want equal rights,which they already have,they have to face the problems the 'well off men' have to face.

TLDR- They should only have EXTRA rights for stuff like sanitary pads,abortion etc,stuff which only THEY have to face. Biological privileges,to be precise. Other than that,they should have equal rights as men do. If a woman acts like an a**hole,she should be insulted as hard as a man would be,in her place.

Parents think it's just a phase,but they probably don't know shit about the psin of being 'another one in the crowd'.
Honestly,it hurts hard,makes you think life's a fucking scam.
Seeing my youtubers,child prodigies,polyglots etc makes my blood boil in jealousy,maybe even bloodlust.
My only goal right now is to become a professor ,in the United States(I'm from India). I just want to get outta here. The environment is not at all stimulating,just more disheartening. 
Maybe all this is our parents' fault. A BIG fault.
All comments talk about 'there is help' bs. I know it exists,but I don't think most people know how much it hurts,the feeling of being a normie.
Best of luck,pal."

A ps3 game that I had,was excited to play,error showed up.
Making a basic electrical circuit. Doesn't work.
Honestly,I think life's a huge scam."
mentalhealth,fm0oyvk,t3_fsa9mp,1585663194.0,"You are right. The worst thing about pets is that.... they will go away someday. 
That's why I feel bad for people who have pets. All the happiness they have,and suddenly,it goes away,vanishes into thin air.
Life is a scam,buddy. 
However,you could cry for a while or do anything that comforts you,like binge watching for a while,eating comfort foods. There is no quick fix for this situation. Doing these little things is how it goes IRL. Even if stuff seems to get fixed in a movie-esqe style,the suffering will be back eventually. 
Also,as usual,seek help if you can. You could have the facility to. I do not. Use it.
I feel bad for your loss. That's all I can do."

mentalhealth,flxkjyk,t3_frsxpc,1585584695.0,"As long as you have enough money to survive,what's the problem with satisfying yourself? That's what extra money is for,to buy whatever you want.
In case somebody is telling you that spending on games is useless,question back by asking if their favourite stuff is really worth spending money on. For example,if they like buying the latest gadgets,ask them, 'What's the point of buying new gadgets so frequently.' They'll probably say something which directly or indirectly means,'Because I enjoy that.'
If you don't need to spend most of your money on basic needs,you can do whatever you want with it. However, if you are sacrificing your basic needs for buying video games,it might bite you back sometime.
Chill."
Cringetopia,flxj8mq,t1_flxgtc3,1585583959.0,"Exactly. From what I know,feminism wanted equality. Men's right groups do too. It's just a few bad fish in a pond,which ruin it all. Blaming feminism or men's right groups,like you said,does not actually address the problem.
Even I get pissed when the girls in my school aren't punished as bad as boys are,for the same thing.Also,thanks for appreciating the analogy. Stuff got pretty serious on a meme forum,I guess."
Cringetopia,flxf6ez,t1_flxcr1a,1585581674.0,"I don't think that's OPPOSITE,to be precise. 
Also, like I said, an equal playing ground can do away with gender inequalities. I believe that instead of giving them extra rights, we can do away with laws which benefit women and harm men,like punishment laws. Like the original commentor said,men recieve harsher sentences than women. However,I think this kinda like a political opinion. Differing from person to person. But what you say is right. Misandry has stemmed from misogyny. But that was in the past. Now,misogyny is looked down upon,but misandry isn't. Even that isn't right,is it? Also,in my defence-

Imagine a car race,which has two racers. One has a powerful sports car,the other has a junk-mobile,about to fall apart.
If they race as it is,the first would win.
We could allow the other racer to customize his vehicle in any way they want,without check. We expect them to tune their vehicle such that it's only as powerful as the first racer's. However,they tune it such that it becomes more powerful than the first racer's. In the end,the other wins.
If we add to it that we are taking some performance affecting parts from the first,to give to the second,keeping that the other still has the right to customize,the first loses even worse than before.
However,if we provide them both the same cars,having the same performance,the winner would be the one who has better skills,not the better car.
Although we could take parts from the other racer,to give to the other,only such that their performances become equal,we could achieve a fair race,but then,the first racer could be unwilling to give parts. Also,if there are rules which say that only those parts can be added which make both of their performances equal,we still could achieve a fair race. However, the second racer says that the parts are not enough,despite their vehicle being equal to the first.
Replace the racers with men and women,and you got my idea.
P.s- Doing away with the entire car race would be a good idea too. It could be a charity drive or stuff,representing the end of all gender based disagreements. But since the topic is gender biased punishment,I believe a car race fits appropriately."

Cringetopia,flx665f,t1_flx5kfd,1585576100.0,"You are right. I just believe that equality can be achieved by doing away with all extra privileges, to provide a fair ground. No side gets extra stuff. As for gender discrimination, it can be eventually eliminated by discouraging stuff which is discriminatory to all genders and punishing those who promote it,both men or women. Just as dislike for slavery exists among most people,dislike for gender discrimination can also come this way."
