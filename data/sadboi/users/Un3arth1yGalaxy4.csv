BPD,eyt1oi4,t3_cyn0vc,1567420713.0,"Yeah I USED to be a lot more defensive and react way more strongly to platonic relationships than romantic relationship. I think since I mainly lacked a close best-friend throughout my entire life I always longed for one. I had a close friend for a few months in middle school but bad stuff happened and they were gone. Only until 18 did I finally have really close best friends and that was where all my Borderline issues started showing up. It didn't help they were online and I didn't know I had Borderline yet, I was supper defensive of our ""group"" and would panic and lash out at anyone trying to hang out with them. I would get depressed about our friendship such as questioning if they saw me as a best friend like I saw them, and would have meltdowns as well.

As of now I don't tend to open up to people anymore. Not to the level I did with my online friends. I keep friends at arms length; which sucks because I see their desire for me to be more open and warm to them but I just can't. I cant say ""love you too"" because my love was crushed  under my own emotional avalanche I caused with Hannah and Matt. I don't want to be their confidant. I don't want to be their friend who would take a bullet for them. I don't want them to get attached to me because I'm not attached to them. I just don't want to feel the pain of a dying friendship again.

BPD,eyt0tvk,t3_cylh5f,1567419450.0,"The first instance that I can for sure say was a full manifestation of BPD was at around 20. Before that I had symptoms but those at the time could were attributed to 1. Interpersonal issues stemming from lack of early social integration 2. Depression 3. Anxiety 4. Fear of abandonment/ Fear of others death. At 20 when having probably one of the deepest interpersonal relationships with people and then having it end was it made pretty clear what my whole deal was. The whole aftermath was my BPD nightmare, but It did help me learn what I had at least."

I'm so scared of the day I find out my s/o cheated on me. It will destroy me and I wont confide it in anybody because I don't confide in friends anymore not after I stopped talking with my FP and best friends. I will just compartmentalize my feelings that slowly push me over the edge into my inevitable lonely lonely suicide. I don't understand humans. I feel so alien. I miss my friends, the ones who are no longer with us feeling pain and the ones who are a phone call away, but I will never contact them because they are better off without me in their lives annoying them."

unpopularopinion,ew5vzm3,t3_cmsch8,1565146527.0,"I think there are some genuinely funny and skilled people who stream. And they create content.


However,  and maybe this is my own unpopularopinion, there are numerous people who try to stream who lack the skill or humour to keep people. Which is made aparant by them trying to stream for years and only get 10 viewers. Most viewers of whom are lonely pathetic people who think they will find community or friendship (that was me back then! Dont get offended) or if its a female streamer maybe they think she's hot. 

I remember on YouTube a similair boom happened where people thought they could get big. Yet lacking any of the skills possessed by the big channels.

Those people arent content creators they are people who need to be realistic and put their energy into something else because they suck at that, but hey youre probably good at other things. Its not a problem. If you use streaming because you are depressed hey so was I! Volunteer your time to a good cause. It is one of the best feeling I get when helping."

I'm sure you've heard this one before that criminals will find illegal ways of obtaining what they want, all this does is punish us law abiding citizens. Maybe politicians will play some mental gymnastics to think everyone will be safer for this and that helps them sleep at night.

It felt like I made so much progress but I was not reaping the rewards of it, of a stable communication. Now I dont even know what to feel. I miss the old days... the memories of staying up till 6am playing League of Legends, our long deep snapchat texts, our snap streaks, playing Tera and bdo and archage with her and other friends.... I really miss that.. I really miss her... Hannah.

It sucks how I improved so much. I thought we'd be happy again and much healthier friendship. And while my improvement was great I lost my friendship with them. Matt, Bella, Hannah, what I wouldnt do to be back with them. But it seems our lives go diffrent directions now. I could give my everything to talk to Hannah again but in the end she'll forget to reply, and I dont... deserve that. I try to be a good better friend now, and I think I'm doing decent job at it. I dont deserve to be treated like a ghost. But God I wish things didnt have to be this way. Duty is the death of love. Sorry for this just needed to get this off my chest."
