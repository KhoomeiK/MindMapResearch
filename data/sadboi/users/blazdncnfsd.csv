Wigs,fp3xpd6,t1_fp3wtvq,1588287758.0,"Thanks! A human hair wig like this can last years with good care and maintenance. I‚Äôve been wearing wigs for a couple years now so I‚Äôve gotten a system down. What I do is I buy a good quality human hair (sometimes synthetic) wig and then install them on myself with lace glue (I use Ghost Bond glue, it can be removed by adding a little isopropyl alcohol to a cotton pad and pressing along the hairline). Before installing, I Dutch braid my hair and put a wig cap over it. I Dutch braid since I don‚Äôt know how to cornrow, and I think my hair might be too straight/long for cornrows anyway. 

After installing the wig, i wear it for about a week or so before removing the glue and double-washing/deep conditioning my real hair as well as the wig. Then I dry my hair, the wig, and repeat the process. 

To sleep with my wig, I put it in a loose ponytail and cover my hair with a silk scarf. In the morning, the hair is usually fine and I just need to brush and straighten/curl. When I shower I use an extra large shower cap. Saves me a lot of time in terms of doing my hair in the morning! Lol

Edit: i also want to add that I learned how to install wigs by myself by watching YouTube videos. There are so many talented wig wearers out there who make my wig look like a party city wig. If you look up ‚Äúhow to pluck a lace front wig‚Äù, ‚Äúhow to glue down lace wig‚Äù, and ‚Äúbald cap method for lace front wig‚Äù you‚Äôll find so many easy to follow sources. Just takes practice!"
