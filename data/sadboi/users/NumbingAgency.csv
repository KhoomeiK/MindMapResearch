AskRedditAfterDark,fqvdifx,t3_gkozfo,1589674976.0,"DO NOT DO THIS. My ex tried to force this same exact kink on me when I was 22. Luckily, despite his best efforts, I got away baby-free. You don’t have to do a damn thing that  makes you uncomfortable. If it turns out he can’t rein it in and respect your limits, get the hell away from him."
extroverts,fqhgdbc,t3_givvhe,1589376421.0,I can’t stand Zoom calls. Just feels like a big tease.
COVID19_support,fqhcfm5,t1_fqhawdf,1589373926.0,"Not the kind of life we want, that’s for sure. I don’t understand people who are apparently fine with being alive for the sake of it, with no joy or quality of life to speak of.

I hope that the majority of people don’t think in such extremes, and the ones that do are just really loud."
COVID19_support,fqhaov7,t3_gitlmt,1589372695.0,"I feel the same way, and I’m sorry that you’re going through it, too. 
I was doing ok until a couple weeks ago. I used to go outside for walks and enjoyed hobbies and texting my friends. I work in healthcare, so I just kind of zone out during work, then go home and just cry. Days off are incredibly painful, because there’s nothing to do but stare at the ceiling and think. 
I feel like I don’t even have coherent thoughts anymore, just sadness and that sick anxious feeling. People keep calling this the ‘new normal’ like this will be forever and I just need to get used to it or else. I feel like a horrible person for wanting my life back and missing my loved ones. I can’t hold on for a vaccine. I don’t know what I’m gonna do."
Anxiety,fp9yc4n,t3_gbnjuv,1588437090.0,"I’m more afraid that the ‘new normal’ will look pretty much like this forever. My mental health is in a very, very bad spot. I worry that I’ll never see my friends in person again, and that there’s nothing in life to look forward to anymore."
Anxiety,fp9xlh1,t1_fp6wkqp,1588436652.0,"I have the same anxiety. I’m scared that this is the permanent new normal, and in-person socializing will never be a thing again. Video chat and texting just doesn’t do it for me."
Anxiety,foj9l31,t3_g7kaf9,1587813756.0,"Yes. I berate myself for pretty much everything I do. I feel like I need to apologize for everything. I keep setting up moving goalposts of perfection for myself, and shame spiral when I don’t meet my own expectations. I feel like an embarrassment to myself, an annoyance to everyone who knows me, and I don’t know how to stop."

Doordash has been a lifesaver as far as distractions and pocket cash go. Hope you paint your house and nails your absolute favorite color, and drive safely!"
