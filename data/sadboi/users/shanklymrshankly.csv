ireland,fpwvyxe,t1_fpwtvhc,1588970976.0,"They could. There's more than enough space around the country, take into account gyms, primary schools etc. How would the virus spread is social distancing and proper hygiene guidelines are followed? Masks would stop the spread in that regard. 

For sure, I can't imagine the amount of ""my teacher hated me so gave me a bad grade"" cases they'll have."
ireland,fpwtkws,t1_fpwteu6,1588969729.0,"The spread can be prevented with apt social distancing measures which are possible.

The appeals system is a mess and will be even moreso with predicted grading."
ireland,fpwt2sj,t1_fpwsmsq,1588969465.0,"And the corruption that will most likely occur within feepaying schools? 

A system that you've yourself admitted is unfair is in no way ""ideal"". A system that, not unlike the current LC system, disregards students mental health and how that may fuck them over with springing this on them is hardly ideal.

Those who don't want to sit the LC this year should do it next year. And those who want to sit it, sit it this year. Boom. Problem solved.

I really hope you get the grades you deserve and that you can go onto study what you want to."
ireland,fpwruzx,t1_fpwqfgo,1588968828.0,"You cannot conclusively say ""hard workers will get what they deserve"" though? I struggled with my mental illness all throughout my LC years and it still affects me in my first year of college. However, I worked extremely hard in my leaving cert year. A 'predicted grade' system would not have reflected that and I have no doubt that there are thousands like my this year.

I'm not sure if you're a college or an LC student but how colleges teach and educate is completely different to how the LC is taught and so, someone's LC experience or attitude is definitely not indicative of how they'll fare in college. In fact, all the students complaining about independent/online learning and using it as a reason as to why the LC shouldn't go ahead, and how it doesn't suit them, might aswell pack in the idea of college now because they will not fare well. Despite flimsy internet connections and missed classtime, I had to sit exams. There is no use babying the students when a regular leaving is possible.

How can you simultaneously acknowledge that the infrastructure isn't there but still try to say that hard workers will get what they deserve? That would imply the proposed system is fair when it's obviously not."
ireland,fpwpl69,t1_fpv6mnh,1588967646.0,"Naturally. Everyone knows the LC is a load of shit but it is the system in place for this year and should be kept that way. It's unfair to grade students on work that they didn't know mattered or counted. I missed most of my LC year due to poor mental health but did extremely well. What about people like me? These people won't even have a chance to do well, if they've missed a substantial chunk because they're being graded on what's already gone past.

There's people who don't cope well in an exam every year. But simply but, Ireland does not have the system for a fair utilisation of predicted grades. Some schools do way more in-class testing than others. I have 3 in class maths tests through 5th and 6th year. So, my grade would've been based on 3 tests? Bullshit, sorry. Also, think about the parents that are paying thousands a year to send their children to certain schools. You think they'll accept anything less than H1s all-round? There'll be massive pressure on those schools and it'll most likely end up being unfair and rigged.

I don't think the demand for predicted grades should be given into because it's not a rational one. And I don't mean to paint students in a negative light, but of course, they will take any way out of actually doing the LC they can find and sorry, but it doesn't make sense to me when it can go ahead as normal. I'd support it if it was the best idea put forward but it's not, it's the laziest one."
ireland,fpv21ki,t3_gfesy1,1588932041.0,"There's absolutely no viable reason why the leaving should not go ahead this year. I did my LC last year and students are supporting the idea of predicted grades, not because it's the best or safest option, but because they don't want to do the exam. Sorry, cold hard truth."
PiercingAdvice,fptzasm,t1_fptoimp,1588901334.0,I haven't changed my bar yet ☺️
PiercingAdvice,fpsr19k,t3_gez9om,1588878154.0,"I've had mine for about 5 months so they're not fully healed yet but I'll do my best to answer your questions!

1) nope! Of course, pain tolerance varies from person to person but I'd honestly give mine both a 3 or 4/10. My pain tolerance is good but I found my nose piercing very painful, about 8/10 if that gives you any comparison:) don't take a painkiller the night before or that day and avoid alcohol in that timeframe too as it thins your blood and makes you bleed more. I was so nervous going to get mine pierced but it was honestly, really quick and easy!!

2) I had to clean mine twice a day at first, and then once after that but your piercer should tell you all this, so don't worry too much about it until then! Cleaning them was never painful and very easy. 

3) I always sleep on my side! I did wear a bra to bed for the first few weeks, just because it made me feel more secure but my piercer said it wasn't necessary. Sometimes, I'd find if I slept on them, there'd be more crusting but it wasn't really an issue.

4) nope!

5) at the start yes, until they get used to the bar ☺️"

BPD,ey7c2vg,t3_cvywg8,1566877921.0,It's hard to tell from just this incident as there's a lot more to BPD than instability in our relationships. I'd definitely talk to your GP about a mental health referral. I hope it works out for you ❤️
