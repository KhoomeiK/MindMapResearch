Im kind of in a similar position though the girl i love hasnt died, her bf who i believe is abusive made her block me on everything and whispers poison in her ear telling her i only loved her because she was easy and things like that which isnt true. Im now 3000 miles away too and dont know what to do. I'm here if u want to talk just send me a message. Because of quarantine im here to talk all day everyday so dont hesitate friend"
depression,fqfz0qb,t3_gimqxr,1589334536.0,"Yup i get you. Sometimes when im having negative thoughts i start having racing thoughts too and my mind goes through hundreds of scenarios to get me to succeed and get out of this hell and everyone comes to the same conclusion, to kill yourself. Its mad and very overwhelming. I always try and remember its just chemical imbalances in my mind that are fucking me up, and that im okay. Like im okay, im not in any immediate danger from anything but myself. Sometimes it happens whilst im at work though if im having a particularly bad day or week. And i'll take a second and stand still and imagine my fingers are a gun. I cock it. Put it under my chin and blow my brains out. Im not sure why i do it. I think its like a reset thing, a moment for me to calm down and realise i could blow my brains out (well i couldnt really i live in the uk) and thatd be it, but in fact things arent that bad, im okay. I dont want to do that. 

I'm glad you're able to realise its just an illness and not what you actually want. It definitely helps deal with it."

I almost failed 2nd year from depression and having a breakdown i was suicidal. Somehow i managed to fight through and get a 2:1 Law degree. I can't really offer u much advice on the spot just like that, but u can dm if u want to, i have nothing going on atm due to corona so im here to listen to what u have to say, and help u the best i can. I believe in u man."
depression,fqe2r22,t3_gicar8,1589300803.0,"If youve failed your course becuase of depression i urge you to talk to the uni/college counsellors and also get a note from your doctor at whatever cost. I was in a similar situation in second year of uni where i had a nervous breakdown and i failed my course. But i was too fucked to be able to speak to a doctor and get a doctors note. They were gonna kick me off the course but they didnt because my marks had been so the first year and first few months of second year. I ended up failing that module and had to redo it in third year with my mark limited to just a pass which was bullshit. And it could have been avoided if i had go the doctors letter as evidence of my illness. I ended up with a 2:1 Law degree by some miracle. If u explain and get a doctors note you should be fine. They will (should) be understanding but they need evidence otherwise every tom dick and harry could just say they failed because of depression when they were actually out at parties and getting high or whatever else. It would have saved me months of stress if i had just got my shit together and got the letter. 

I believe in you dude, if u ever need to chat hmu anytime. Im in quarantine so i got all the time in the world rn."
depression,fqe19hu,t3_gichk7,1589300104.0,"This is very relatable. Just dont give up and you'll be okay. I'm not gonna say it'll get better because it hasnt for me yet, but there are periods where it is better. I'm 21 and recently had my first relationship for a few months and i fell madly in love but it turned out i was a an affair and she loved someone else. I have a 2:1 law degree which is literally a miracle as i failed sooo many exams at school all i can do is laugh. Like basically you're winning aslong as you keep on trying. You dont need to be trying your hardest either.

Also try and get help with your depression. I hope i'll finally have the courage to after quarantine. I really want to now. I thought i should be able to deal with it myself and get passed it, but its been like 6 years now and it's still crippling me. Also remember that its mostly just chemicals in your brain, just chemical imbalances. So when you feeling really bad remind yourself that its just chemicals and let yourself know that things aren't really that bad, ie youre in no immediate danger. Youre not gonna die if u fail an exam etc etc. With the right medication or therapy you will have more energy and you will get the motivation back. And i truly believe it."
depression,fqdutcw,t3_gicje5,1589296977.0,"Hello friend, it sounds like youre going through a tough time, i empathise. Obviously i dont know the ins and outs of your situation but i know what its like stressing over work and exams and stuff. Ive had bad cognitive dysfunction for the last like 6 years due to depression, and it makes studying so fucking hard for me. im currently 21. I failed so many exams at school, there was so many times i literally felt like my world was falling apart around me. And so many times i scraped through by the skin of my teeth. Now i have a university 2:1 law degree. I have no fucking idea how. I failed french, english language, engineering, religious studies at gcse (15years old) and i failed physics at A-level and got poor grades in biology, business and economics and general studies.

Im sorry about your mum too that must be tough for you. Im also getting over a breakup rn and it hurts a lot. But i imagine it makes doing work and stuff all the more challenging. Tbh i can tell you're a strong individual by the fact you havent given up. You feel like giving up, but you havent. At the end of the day all you or anyone else can do is try. You'll go through good and bad times, times where youre motivated to work and do well and times where you dont care anymore and dont want to work or cant work. But all you can do is keep trying.

If you need someone to talk to or need a yes man then hmu literally anytime, because im just stuck in my room because of corona anyway. Tbh the only thing that motivates me, is helping others. Depression is no fun for anyone."
depression,fqbubpw,t1_fqbrb00,1589244070.0,"Thanks for your response. I know you're right about everything u said. It's just gonna take time. It's just ive never loved a girl before. Yeah ive had crushes on girls and stuff but the fact i thought she loved me definitely made me love her more. She made me feel on top of the world and i did my best to make her feel the same. I thought she did by what shed say to me. But it was just a game. 

I dont have a constant supply of codeine and morphine anyway so i doubt it'll become a problem. I go through periods of using it for a few weeks and use up my supply and then i dont have it for like 6 months. I'll stop using when the feelings aren't so raw. Im just pretty upset right now and have no one to talk about it with. I know i'll be relieved eventually because it wasnt even real in the first place. I think thats the most painful thing though, not that she cheated on me (well, on the other guy technically) but that our relationship was bs from the start. She just lied to me from day fucking one. I think theres a good chance shes a sociopath because it was messed up i tell ya. Its so messed up it messaed me up to the point where i forgive her and still love her. I guess she just manipulated me from the start like putty in her hand. I am a clown. 

Its 1:30am her in the Uk, so i'm going to sleep. Thanks for your response i appreciate hearing something useful and a reminder that things will get better, my friends just say 'move on' or 'forget about it' like its some easy thing and they show no empathy, which doesn't help me when im hurting."

Ozark,fm14vwe,t1_fm12zd5,1585672050.0,"For the first time in the show i was rooting against the byrdes, particularly wendy shes a narcissist.

The byrdes should have left at the end of season 2 (obviously we wouldnt have season 3 though lol), like this cartel wouldnt have found them. They could only find ben because wendy told them where he fuckin was. With new id's in another country and jonas secret crypto account shit they could have started fresh. I feel like that was their best opportunity.

But yeah this show hits hard, its incredibly written, the last few episodes of season 3 were horrible (as in what happens to ben and stuff) but it is great storytelling.

No. And thats why you wouldnt research a vitamin c tablet. Also ive ordered a FP-5 filter, they seem pretty cool.

I will do. The seller has a few negative reviews, from recent weeks saying their products contained asbestos. Obviously i ordered mine before these came up. But the seller has been active since 2009 so its not like they came for a quick book and didnt giv a fuck about their feedback and stuff. I mean its a pretty detrimental feature of the product, its not like they are forgetting a minor detail lol.

Yeah it wasnt great i thought i was gonna die from hypothermia. Thankfully some of my mates housemates found me haha. I also projectile vomited bright orange in the morning which was epic. I had drank 1 litre of vodka and a litre bottle of robinsons orange squash at a 50:50 ratio. I tested it and it was the only way the vodka wasnt too strong and there was a good squash flavour. I dont even want to know how much sugar that was. Teeth rotting stuff ahaha. 

I do, but i got no dollar and no where to go. Possibly gonna move in with 2 mates in bristol in september but i doubt it will happen.

Might be a laugh, i might suffocate, only one way to find out. We're hopefully gonna go to amsterdam in june with some of the guys he knows in bristol. Yeah camping trips are always good i havent had one in almost 2 years now though.

One of the new lads at work went to manny uni he was in my year at school. He seems to have enjoyed it, he goes down there on his days off to smoke with his friends and go out and stuff. 

It sounds like it yeah, but im really not. Good days are few and far between. Like 1 day every 2 months, if that. Tbh all im missing is a group of friends to do normal friend shit with, like going to maccies, or the pub, or camping, smoking, hell I'd shovel shit if a group of lads invited me to. 

In my experience people seem to get to comfortable with their friend groups to the point where they wont invite or consider anyone out of their group. I dont know the reason for it because i havent been in one to know. But i guess maybe its so theres not a chance the outsider upsets other people in the group and they end up falling out with the group because they invited u, or maybe they worried you will become better friends with the group and they get left out. I really dont know. In sixth form, 2 of my mates were booking a holiday with their friend group that consistes of like 7 people, they invited me and i said yes, i know all the group but dont live in there town so never spent enough time with them to really be good mates. Anyway, when i asked about it a few days later they had booked it without me and said they thought i said no. That was a punch in the gut for sure, they were 2 of my best mates and just forgot about me lol"

Its just so dark, wet and miserable here, i didnt go to the gym in the end as i didnt fancy going out in the rain and wind. I went for a drive earlier by a lake called ullswater. Its been flooded the last 2 months, the water is upto the road level, so its a pretty fun drive.

That kept me alive. But now she going out with her ex for the last 3 weeks, which kinda ruined my 'doing okay' streak, so to speak and i sank very hard and very quickly. Just started to get my energy backup the last few days, might even manage a gym sesh tonight. 

The last 2 guys i hung out with a lot moved to France and Australia in february which basically tore a massive whole in the hull, if we using a boat and sinking analogy still.

I live with my parents and siblings, but they are no comfort, we have nothing in common and they only really talk to me to give me a careers lecture, which i dont need to hear. I didnt think id have never been in a relationship by the time i was 21, like shit i been trying since i was 12/13 in school. Everyone else i know has been in a relationship. Everyone i know my age has lost there v card (i dont really care about losing it so much that id get a hooker or random fat girl from tinder, its just a fact). I want to move out of my parents house literally just so i can do drugs when im not working, fucking numb myself until the next shift. Sad thing is work is the best part of my life. The job is shit, but i dont care, im just glad to have people to talk to and have a laugh with. Because i know as soon as i finish my shift im on my own fighting my demons until the next morning."
depression,fjp2qdv,t3_fem7uc,1583540406.0,"Yup, i have it bad, cognitive dysfunction, brain fog, i feel like my brain is going a million miles an hour and im unable to focus on anything. I have a fucking law degree as well, it seems so dumb. At work people hand me money and i count it and I immediately forget. Other day a scottish woman gave me £20 and 60p in change for something that was £11.60 i passed her the £5 change and was trying to figure out what change (in coins) i was giving her and i was just mind fucked, and then i almost got it and she chirps up 'thats only £5' in my mind im like 'stfu lady gimme a second'. But her distraction caused me to forget where i was at. I had clicked on the till that she gave a £20 note (because she passed me the 60p change after) so on my screen it says i owe her £8.40 but i actually owe her £9. Recently ive had energy at work but its probably from modafinil i been taking, usually im light headed and feel like my knees will just give out."

Sometimes it will last a day or 2, but then nope. I just am not interested what so ever again. It pisses me off real bad.

Thats no necessarily a bad thing. Honestly i think if i was american i would dual wield magnum 500's whilst pretending to be django (obviously not shooting real people, just a snowman i guess like in the film). Imagining shooting my melon with a gun and having one in your hand is completely different, obviously. Its like imagining getting a hooker vs actually getting one, for me at least.

Though whenever i try i get mad cravings for chocolate, or something will happen in a day where i got no time to have actual food so i go to burger king. Then it just fucks me up again. The last few days ive been trying to increase my food and specifically protein intake, eating like a whole pack of sandwich roast chicken on my break at work instead of having shite snacks like i have been doing this year so far like cookies and muffins and mochas. I was hoping to start going to the gym again this week, but i said the same thing the last 4 weeks. I have been like 5 or 6 times but just really havent been feelin it. Im definitely struggling being alone. My bud that i hung out with most moved to france just over a month ago. I hoped id find other people to hang out with, go to the gym with etc but it just hasnt happened.

The thing is when i have a crush on someone and a relationship seems inside the realm of possibilty, theres something worth fighting for in a sense. Gives me positive energy, and makes me want to keep improving myself in hope theres a chance. Then little things happen or are said and i come to the realisation that shes not into me. Been pining over this girl at work since she started in november. Went for breakfast wit her on valentines day, but not as my valentine, we were just hungry af haha. But then 2 of my friends said maybe she actually wanted me to ask her to be my valentine. Im pretty sure she didnt though, but this sent my imagination wild as you can imagine. I was gonna ask her out, but then her and her ex were tagging each other in fb posts, mostly like food porn shit but the comments looked like 2 people who were a couple, i dunno. I might ask her to hang out tomorrow or friday, but i probbaly just need to quit my job and gtf over it. But obviously my mind holds on to that 0.2% chance she likes me. It also makes me feel worthless, when over the last pretty much 8 years, through school, college, uni and now work, has no one ive ever had a crush on, liked me. Im the only person i know my age that hasnt been in a relationship (or lost the v card)(im 21 btw). My friends have a crush on a girl and then they date the girl. Its a normal fucking, a fucking universal thing in a humans life, yet i seem incapable haha. Definitely fucks with me anywho!"

My friends friend had his phone stolen by 2 russian guys on a night out in birmingham, we found them outside but the others were scared to do anything about it and were saying just leave it. I jumped over this like 7 foot fence and beat the crap out out of one of them to get the phone back and then they chased me for a while whilst i caught up with the others and we seeked refuge in some random persons flat where we ate these weird fish snacks that they eat in asia lol."

depression,fjav26r,t3_fci4zs,1583181150.0,"Same thing happened to me bro at uni. I was in second year uni having a fucking breakdown, i was stressed to fuck and couldnt sleep, id get to sleep like 7am and had uni at 9am, the days i made it in i had lass than 3 hours sleep, most days i was sleeping through my alarms and waking up like 3, 4, 5pm sometimes later. My hair was falling out everywhere as well which stressed me out even more. Having no friends didnt help at all, i only ever heard from my house mates if they wanted money for the wifi or it was my turn to buy loo roll. I wanted to fucking die. I hadnt talked to anyone about my depression before. I rang up my mum after class one day that i made it in and told her i was depressed, she just tried to normalise it like i was just a bit down for a few days, telling me i needed to get to the gym and eat some more fucking vegetables (though thats always good advice in general, doing that doesnt help with crippling depression).

I missed a speaking/oral assignment and went to see the uni counsellor woman the week after. Told her what was going on. She told me go home early for christmas (it was early december), see a doctor and stuff and fill in a deferral form for my last assignment before christmas. I went home, tried to see a doctor, as in i rang up to make an appointment, i was told a doctor would ring me later, which he did. We had a 5 minute chat (i say a chat, but he just asked a few questions and i gave yes or no answers pretty much) if that and he prescribed me antidepressants. Never got to see a doctor, got no diagnoses and no doctors note which i needed as proof. The whole experience was too much for my anxiety and i shut myself off and never spoke of it again. I didnt get my deferral, and they were gonna throw me off the course.

I somehow managed to pull my shit together the rest of the year and get some 1:1 grades and they let me redo the module but capped at 40%/a third class. 

I finished my degree with a 2:1, god fucking knows how. A lot of my problems could have been avoided if i had been insistent on seeing a doctor. I think the doctor just brushed me off as being another hormonal teen, sent me on my way with some drugs and told me to come back in a month (which i never did). 

See a doctor and get your doctors note! I know its easier said than done from my own experience but it will save your damn life, i can guarantee that."

Im 21 and work in a supermarket. We do date checks every morning. Every morning, multiple times i have to check what the date is. Im not sure if its memory loss or i doubt myself so bad its like ocd shit. Its like if im not 100% focussed on why im checking what the date is then i forget, i look at my phone at the date, and have to read it multiple times telling myself its the 26th (or whatever day it is). Also i forget words all the time, i get halfway through a sentence and forget what im saying or foget a word. And its occuring too damn often. I have bad cognitive dysfunction, when someone asks me a question at work i cant just immediately answer, its like my mind goes through each step of hearing what the question is ie the word themselves, then understanding what the combination of words is asking for, then thinking of what the answer is, and then communicating that answer. And each stage is happening to fookin slow or it breaks down somehwhere. Some people i work with think im retarded, but nope, just cripplingly depressed, if thats a word lol."

I realised i dont even care about being a virgin really, like id love to have sex. Hust with someone i actually like. I feel like a worthless piece of shit, and wonder if people see me as a fucking weirdo or something. But i feel like i behave pretty normally, and have no idea why girls havent been interested in me? Like i go to the gym top and am pretty ripped, and i dress pretty well and am clean. Like i just dont get it. Even going to clubs and talking to girls and shit at uni, id do the same as what other guys i went out with were doing, yet they were getting girls and i was getting nothing. I can only describe it as it being as if i was fucking invisible. So theres this girl i like at work and i was gonna ask her out tomorrow at the end of our shift as we finish at the same time tomorrow. Iwas like 83.673% sure shed say no. But if she did say no i was gonna hand in my notice soonish and move to where my friends are, across country and find a graduate job. If she said yes id stay atleast another 5 months or so.

I have a few friends but they all live away, as in other side of the country. I have a few 'friends' here, but when theyre not working there usually busy going to parties or nights out with their friend group that im not apart of, and so i dont get invited to anything.

Its like a test of whether im worth anything yet. If she says no then im not good enough, and i can move away and progress my career and improve myself. If she says yes, then im finally worth while to somebody i guess.

I went to amsterdam a few weeks back and had my first shroom trip, and it was fucking great ngl. Ive had coke which was also pretty nice, it didnt make me feel brilliant, just normal, no racing thoughts or negative thoughts. It was peaceful. I also wish i could smoke weed more but i live out of town with my parents. So i drive everywhere, and wont drive high for obvious reasons. I plan to go back to dam next month with some guys i used to know, hopefully its a good trip in both senses. Ive been having suicidal thoughts too fuckin often the last few weeks for the first time in like 5 months, and been thinking of ODing.

Back in october id drive to work every morning at 6am in the dark and i would speed on the country roads at like 90mph, the speed limit is 60mph on most bits and 40 on others. And i would seriously consider just driving straight into a wall, only thing that stopped me was the feer it wouldnt actually kill me. I started to feel a bit better as i was working on my social anxieties, and with a lot of effort, ended up talking to a lot of people at work, where i had always been very shy and would only really say hello and how are you and that kinda shit. But the last few weeks im back to where i was, i want to fucking die, i hav no friends and never had a relationship. I see other people out with their group of friends or with there partner, and its such a normal thing, i dont feel like i should be any different or less able but clearly I am.

Anyway, what is bothering you so much bro? I get you're depressed and what not, but you must remember its chemicals and shit dude, you dont want to die, its your mind playing tricks on you. I have had suicidal thoughts again the last 3 and a bit weeks almost constantly, the thoughts consume my mind, but every so often i manage to ground my self long enough to let myself know its just chemicals, and nothing is really that bad. Depression takes every feeling and thought out of proportion, you lose sense of reality and perspective. But its chemicals that fuck with you.

Every day ive promised i wont do it today, and i take it one day at a time. All we can do is keep trying. But I'll tell you now, unless you have a terminal illness and you have a week to live or some shit, theres NO point in stopping trying!

I sometimes think my disabled brother has affected me. He has anger issues, and hates me half the time, punches me and throws stuff at me and used to scratch me (like not just playing either).

I guess thats just depression. This guy at work i talk to a lot whos like 31 and has a wife and kids, was telling everyone I was gonna ask this girl to be my valentine's, which I 100% am not because shes 16 (it wouldnt be illegal because im in the uk btw, it happens. But I think its still pretty bad nonetheless). We get on well and I like her company, it was nice to have someone to talk to out of work. It was the first time ive spent time with any work colleague out of work. I have asked before, but no one had ever said yes. Also i noticed how bad my cognitive dysfunction is. I just forget what im saying mid sentance, its embarrassing. I feel like a right tit.

Little did he know i had been doing boxing the last 3 years (he literally didnt know) and i hit him with an uppercut almost knocked him spark out, he fell back and i jumped on him and got him in the headlock on the floor. It didnt take long for him to apologise. He tried to tell everyone I had just attacked him for no reason, because im crazy apparently, and I showed them the video with him there and they finally realised what a dick he is. We get along fine now, we go watch football together and play games online like apex together. I think he has more respect for me now id say, either that or hes scared of another beating lol. I was 18 at the time and he was 25. So i dont know if your brother needs a good beating, but it may knock some sense into him. Obviously i dont mean just go upto him and attack him either.

So i probably have 4 months at most left working here. Now my friend that i hang out with most days has moved to france I need to find some other people to spend time with. Yes, I would like to avoid losing these connections, but at the same time if they are nothing more than people to talk to but only at work, there's not really anything to hold onto"
depression,fgsjlhz,t1_fgsi9xp,1581085976.0,"I havent really had thats so much tbh besides at work. The friends that I have will go to the pub, go for lunch, some will go to the gym, or go to the cinema or go on holidays and nightsout. I have many acquaintances at the gym and stuff. People i talk to and am friendly with but i dont consider them friends nor do they me. Sometimes I talk to my friends at work about things and I kinda feel weird about them opening up to me, i feel like saying why are you telling me this. Its the sort of stuff you tell close friends. One of the girls was talking to me about her half brother shes never met because he doesnt want anything to do with his dads new family.

It feels like it has been a waste because i have tried, and i might be leaving in the next couple of months and I will come away with no friends once again. Its made work better to some extent, i always stay back like 10-15 minutes after work to talk to the guys in a different department (i dont see them much through the day) where as everyone else is straight out the door the second they finish. People have better things to do, friends to go and meet etc but I dont. I know im gonna be alone for the rest of the day so I dont want to leave."
depression,fgqtifz,t1_fgqkdiw,1581031169.0,"Well I got my parents on my back wanting me to get on the career ladder and stuff, but i just dont feel ready for it, like in terms of knowledge and intelligence and stuff I could do it for sure, but i feel like i havent really lived. I was never apart of the big friendship group/circles at school, i got on with almost everyone enough to chat with them, and i had a few good friends who were in other friend groups. And that was kinda the issue. I never got invited to events, or lads holidays or birthday parties because I was somehow an outsider, of every group lol. The people i was friends with wouldn't invite me to come to group events, i can only assume because they were too comfortable with there group and didnt want to risk me coming and then not getting on with someone or something. i dont even know tbh. At school i always had people to hang out with and go for lunch with. Literally the day i finished school my first thought was 'fuck im on my own', it was a daunting feeling, as i realised school had been my social hub and without it I had no one. 

At uni I was ready for a fresh start and it was going alright but i was kinda abused by these 2 crazy girls I lived with in student halls, to the point where I barely left my room. Eating pot noodle in my room for a week became a better option than going out and possibily seeing them. It went downhill from there with mental health and shit. But since finishing and starting my job I've been doing a lot better, challenging my social and situation anxieties, from just talking to colleagues but also making phonecalls and things (which used to scare the shit out of me (i dont even know why)). I have social anxieties which is probably why i made this post. But at the same time i actually love socialising. 

I feel like i missed out on a lot of teenage things, it upsets me but i try not to dwell on it. Instead im trying to do the things i didnt do, whilst im working a stress free and responsibility free job. Like i went to amsterdam and barcelona last minute, 2 weeks ago with my friend (whos now moving to france).

Tbh I feel like ive just been very unlucky. All I can do is keep trying really."
depression,fgqgbxb,t1_fgpw7rv,1581023642.0,"I dont feel like i ask for much tbh, not like im asking for a kiss when i got corona virus. Its hanging out. I cant figure out the issue either tbh, im a bit slow sometimes, i got some cognitive dysfunction going on, and they take the piss out of me for it, but in a jokey way. We all tease each other and shit and are sarcastic af as u are with ya mates. I used to go to this pub for lunch on my own many times when I was at uni, sometimes eceryday for a while. Id look around and see all the students in there with there mates that they live with or go to class with etc, and i went on my own everyday. I invited people sometimes they always said no, except this one time this lad who none of my 'friends' at uni liked (because hes quite pedantic about stuff, and is wound up easily and so everyone would wind him up) came with me, as annoying as he was, i appreciated his company. But he left because he had a kid. He was like 25 at the time i was 18 sooo. As little as it may seem to anyone else, I will appreciate and respect him for aslong as i dont have dementia. 

I definitely dont come across as force full, its like 'so what you upto after work', then they say like 'going to bed probably and getting my nails done later' (one of the girls is always getting her nails done haha) then id say like 'oh im going into town for something to eat you want to come?' Or 'i'm going to maccies for a breakfast, u wanna come? I can give u a lift home if you like?' (I say that because its always raining where I live and everyone else lives like 10 minute walk away, i live just out of town so i drive in). There responce would typically be 'im eating healthy atm (coz its new year)' or there going to get there nails done or they need to sleep and one lad always is going to see his grandad. Could he not say yeah im going to see my grandad but maybe after or something. I havent asked any of them more than twice, I dont want to appear needy, but in a way I am. I crave some kind of social interaction outside work. I hate leaving work because I know I'll have just myself and my thoughts for the rest of the day. One day a few weeks ago i even gave an open invite in the canteen, i was like 'im going for coffee at costa anyone want to come?' And no one wanted to haha. 

Well the one guy I would talk to is moving to australia next week, and my only good friend outside of work who i see regularly is moving to france this weekend, and tbh im feeling a bit shit about it tbh. I wont be having any heart to hearts with them any time soon. As i said I may just be overthinking it and there reasons were genuine, I guess i need to keep trying to find out. And dont get me started on social media, its hell on earth haha"
depression,fgptc2v,t1_fgpo4lp,1581011603.0,"Thanks for the response, its useful hearing other peoples perspectives. However, Imo a friend is someone who appreciates your company and vice versa, whether its in work or out of work, there isnt a border in that respect. Either youre friends or youre acquaintances. I find it hard to draw a line between the 2 though. But its often drawn for me. People who invite me to stuff and accept my invites (not necessarily everytime) are friends. If no one wants to spend time with you they are not really a friend but an acquaintance. I think. And we work in a supermarket so i wont be relying on them for any jobs or any references, as hr deals with that. I'm also not demanding they be close friends. I dont think you have to be close friends with someone to go for a coffee after work with them. But i am collegial with my colleagues also, but theres just no point being over friendly and talkative if theyre not a friend. If that makes sense. 

I'd like to be friends with them out of work as I plan on leaving in a couple months and i feel like all the time ive spent talking to them and getting to know them would all be for nothing. I can deal with that also. Im just trying to figure out when to stop trying. :)"
depression,fgprt54,t1_fgpoa67,1581010762.0,"First of all thank you for taking the time to respond. Your first point about not wanting to mix personal and work relationships, I would totatlly get that in a professional work environment, being a solicitor or something, but we work in a supermarket together, the older people at work all seem to have mixed there personal and work lives to some extent. I thought it was a pretty normal thing.

The last few years i havent had people to hang out with and just do normal shit friends do, like hell if someoene invited me to go shovel shit with them id go, even better if we go to the pub afterwards. But i cant get anyone to do anything. It was the same story at uni. On the rare occasion someoen invited me to play football (i think that was 4 times in 3 years) or go to pepes chicken or some shit i said yes. But whenever I invited people they are too busy. And so i spent 95% of my time completely alone. Only time i saw people on the average day was my lecture class, none of them would do anything out of uni either. Everyone just wanted to go home to bed or some other bs.

I dont plan on staying in my current job, I have my law degree. Only thing keeping me is that I like the people (and im also saving up to go on a europe road trip in june lol). I'm pleasant to everyone at work. Even the people i dont consider friends I can have a good chat with. Just theres some people I talk to a lot more, sometimes going out of my way of doing my job just to talk to them. So i guess im wondering if I should cut that out, and talk to them if I see them and thats it.

Well the thing is I havent asked them enough, probably, to know if they genuinely dont want to hang out or there reasons were legit. Like we are tired after work sometimes, especially as we start at 6:30. But now i'm overthinking it, wondering how to ask them and womdering if I have been asking them in a weird way or something. I guess the thing is, is if any of the guys at work (atleast the ones in there late teens, 20's and 30's) asked me if i wanted to do anything after work or go to the pub for a drink tonight or whatever, i would say yes. It might just be me thats like that though I suppose. Everyone has different perspectives and value different things. 

Actually as I got to the end of writing this I remembered there was a woman who I worked with last year and she finished at the end of the year but we used to go to the gym together. She was 31 and had a husband whos 44 and has step kids. Imo that was weirder than if the guys my age hung out, out of work, because she was married and going to the gym with a younger jacked dude (thats me) lol. I think i would think that was pretty weird if I was her husband.

Obviously I cant force people to be friends if theyre not wanting friends, i suppose I'm just unsure when i should give up and move on. Im also unsure whether i have been asking the right questions and asked them in the right way haha"
NewTubers,fgp6ssh,t1_fgooxht,1580998286.0,"Thanks for the encouraging words. It combines 2 things I enjoy, making videos and exploring so seems like a fun idea. I feel like a lot of exploring videos you dont get a true perception of the atmosphere of the place, usually because theres too much talking and I guess you dont see as much through a camera as with a humans peripheral vision. I kinda thought about doing some 3d tours (with a 3d camera like the samsung gear 360) of popular toursit places here, like some of the lakes and fell walks and stuff. We get a massive amount of asian tourists. Barely any asian people live, its like 95% white, atleast. So maybe I could do some chinese narration on them for the chinese audience. Whats pre and after filming btw? Sorry if thats a dumb question"

NewTubers,fgkf0dq,t1_fgkedto,1580864018.0,"Yeah, I almost did but I messed up. I have 3 videos with over 100k views but they all suck, because the mic I used to use was so bad and my editing skills were bad. These 3 videos equal over a third of my channel views. On one hand I could private them so people only see my good videos, but on the other hand i may barely get any views anymore if I do that, and I dont mind the extra £2+ a day. It goes into a seperate bank account that I use for buying stuff for my channel, like new games or my new mic etc etc"
NewTubers,fgkdyk4,t1_fgkcmyl,1580863329.0,"I do, but also I don't want to play games I don't enjoy. Then it becomes pretty pointless. Yeah this guy who used to play this particual game on his channel has like 290,000 subs and he got invited to events to play games before release and stuff. His videos are mediocre imo, and he focuses on lego games specifically. His channel has old videos with 6 million views and more recent ones with like 50 views. Its crazy how you can have 280,000 subs and get 50 views on a video. I think he was one of the first lego youtubers and so he has managed to make a success of it."
NewTubers,fgkc5fy,t1_fgk86ns,1580862141.0,"Fair enough, i'm just starting my 4th year since i started properly, 5th of feb 2017 was when i started. But i gained 1.5k subs in the last year so there must be some exponential growth i guess. However my highest views in a day was in 2017, there was a week in summer i got over 4k views a day for over a week, one of those days i got 7,500 views and 2 others i got over 6,000, i thought I had made it haha. Since then ive had no where near that amount a day, 4k on a very very good day, but my daily average is like 1,000-2,000

Its pretty unlikely I will get to 10k this year, I will try, but the game I play is losing players and viewers quickly as it came out in 2015. When I try and play other games I get literally no views. I need to find something good to replace it and quickly. Though theres nothing else thats super poplular yet super niche at the same time."
NewTubers,fgk7qdw,t3_eyrfk2,1580859293.0,"I was once asked for permission to use part of one of my videos, in one of there videos, by a media company that makes the videos for the official Lego gaming youtube channel. I cant find it rn its buried somewhere in there hundreds of videos. So that was pretty cool and nice of them to ask. Ive been offered affiliate schemes, but honestly they've all been irrelevant to my channel, I just use amazon affiliate so you can literally get a link for any product you want. My goal is to reach 10k subs (currently have 3k), because I  don't have a particularly loyal fan base atm (i have videos with 15 views and others with 150,000 lol) I want to build a solid fanbase who like watching my videos for me and not just me playing one particular lego game if that makes sense. Only then will I approach some companies. I dont feel like I have enough to offer yet. But good for you for trying and putting yourself out there, sometimes all it takes to get something is to ask. Companies may not discover you organically so you gotta make yourself be known."
depression,fgguxdk,t3_eycc1h,1580770123.0,"Atleast you had 10% look at the bright side, imagine how you would feel if it was 0%. Plus people tend to forget, i know the birthday of like 4 of my friends, the others i know what month perhaps, other than that i rely on facebook, which never notifies me anyway. I think I had 1 friend say happy birthday to me for my last birthday, my 21st. I felt pretty bad ngl, but it is what it is. I understand why you're upset and would want to vent, its easy for me to say to look on the bright side. But it will be okay! :)"
NewTubers,fga8kxr,t1_fg9y6zk,1580648207.0,"But surely there is causation, as the stats only go down when I upload. The correlation would have to be a massive coincidence if uploading was not the cause, theres no consistancy in when i upload, could be 5 times a week, could be twice a month."
