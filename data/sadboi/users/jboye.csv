depression,f5uwjm7,t1_f5sif8e,1572480389.0,No I definitely am
depression,f121mbf,t1_f1206gs,1569133574.0,Thank you for the advice! It’s true I always feel good afterwards too despite all the self hatred before hand. And when I deny people I pretty much instantly regret it right when I send the text.
Showerthoughts,f11z4m5,t1_f10zkpm,1569132573.0,Was looking for a comment like this to reassure that I’m not the only one who expresses my thoughts out loud when I’m alone.
depression,f0xv9oa,t1_f0v83i1,1569048657.0,Boop. Hahaha boop
depression,f0l4loc,t1_f0l4dyj,1568698366.0,Forreal. That’s literally what triggered this episode I just had. Seeing shit on social media that you want for yourself fuckin hurts sometimes.
depression,f06l3ma,t1_f05sg50,1568440088.0,Yeah that’s a big part of it for me too. It’s the idea that there’s still stages left to go through that kinda excites me sometimes. But figuring out how to be happy in the moment is the struggle.
depression,f05m1d2,t1_f041lk9,1568413265.0,"I guess I’m not one to give advice as I still struggle with depression. Though, I’ve been able to make progress this year as some days are better than others finally. I thought I’d share the type of thinking that has helped me progress. But I understand, I’ve totally been in a place where I was in denial of any type of “pep talk”. But damn I didn’t think people would be so angry, I’m kinda hurt lol. But fuck it man, I like where I’m heading to a certain degree, y’all can’t phase me."
depression,f038y21,t3_d3gpcr,1568348103.0,"I’m a good looking 22 year old virgin. Never been on a date, never really been friends with a girl. Looks don’t mean everything man. The most effective type of attraction is personality.

Also one of my closest friends is also a 5”4 Asian and he has a lot of potential romantic interests. He’s funny as fuck so that’s what gets girls attention for sure.

I’m also Asian so I know how you feel. We’re the underdogs, but that kinda gives is leverage to a certain extent, because they expect less from us yet once we show them more, it sparks interest."
depression,f037uzg,t1_f037lwq,1568347227.0,"Aight idgaf, coffee. I really literally want to get the fuck out of this cycle of depression and share some things that have helped me lol."

2meirl4meirl,eys5pr0,t3_cyd3gp,1567387877.0,"Fuccckkkk. She liked me I think, Idk, but now she’s gone. Nah she didn’t like me any way. But even if she did I didn’t do shit."
depression,eyl7o1j,t3_cxcq6t,1567178130.0,Ok bro I see how you just low key dropped some bars at the end real quick
depression,eyl76pw,t1_eyjexiw,1567177808.0,"This. I honestly hate how people think depression is so exclusive. Yes there are people who fake depression for attention but that’s not true for majority I feel like because it’s actually proven that the numbers are growing exponentially these days. It makes me feel better that I’m not alone. Like when I first started seeing depression memes on twitter and shit I was like holy fuck I really didn’t think so many people felt this shit too. It gave me comfort. Also depression and anxiety has always been a big epidemic. I personally know people who’ve gone through mental illness, and are going through it. 15% of the adult population will experience depression. If y’all just do some research, you’ll realize how big the numbers are. It’s kinda scary, but at the same time you realize how there’s so many others like you. It’s not to a point where like mostly everyone is depressed, but I’d say if there was a college class of like 40 people, there’d be a handful a students that could relate to depression."
depression,exneop7,t3_ctht6x,1566453831.0,"The hell part hit home. It’s painful to be in a world where happiness exists all while not being able to experience it. When you’re in pain day after day, it’s misery, which is hell. I always get this thought that I died a long time ago and was sent to hell. Scary ass thought. Fuck that thought. But everything is real bro. We just took some wrong turns and gotta find our way back. This world can be enjoyed some how, that’s what keeps me going."
depression,exje886,t3_csupvp,1566348222.0,Yeah the other day I had breakdown because I couldn’t find my keys right before work. Shit just kinda builds up inside and the smallest thing can just spark an eruption. Like “not only am I miserable all the time but now this?!?”
depression,ewqx2dh,t1_ew60sc4,1565683385.0,"I know what you mean. I feel like depression has allowed me to to think far deeper than most people, however, it has also crippled me to the point where I can’t leave my bed. But I see where you’re coming from, there is definitely positives from going through depression. What I think is thats m the aftermath of depression of the positive outcome."
depression,ewqwv8c,t1_ew60dlq,1565683094.0,Hahahaha sad but true
depression,ewqwrro,t3_cpidz8,1565682947.0,Yes
depression,euykd1x,t3_chql98,1564104063.0,I knew it was possible. Your words were already in my head and reading them was very comforting. What even more comforting isn’t knowing even the people we should turn to can also go through it.
