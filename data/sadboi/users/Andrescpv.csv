This morning I just talked to my girlfriend about this and she told me some things I didn’t agree with and made her cry, she then hung up... I felt the worst person at that moment and made me think about what I did yesterday to my parents and I just couldn’t handle to feel bad... it was a shock between everything I felt and spent a lot crying while just looking at a cable thinking if I wasn’t coward enough to not do it. I’m more calmed now, but now the suicidal thinking is constant, not like thinking on doing it, but it’s just there as if waiting any trigger to do it.

I’m going to a psychologist for all of the gender change and I thought I was all fine, actually felt as if I never felt happier before, but I don’t know why everything just fell down."
