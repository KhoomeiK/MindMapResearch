Literally went to Las Vegas with friends and had the ulterior motive to track down his ex business partner to find out if he'd actually done some bad investments or if all his money had gone to another one of his families or some shit.

IWantToLearn,f8ec2tl,t3_e0el9l,1574524542.0,"I think it might be a little more meta-textual than seeing the literal purpose they serve in your life. I really like the idea of this exercise and may have to try it myself!

I'd say be as honest with yourself as possible in your answers, but don't stop there. Ask yourself why you think you need said purpose from this person, and how that need reflects on who you are deep down.

To be clear, I'm not saying there's any wrong answers or you should be ashamed of needing people, I'm just saying I think your therapist might be digging at something a little deeper, like maybe what you lacked in the past and try to fulfill with people you know now. 

It's very important to know *why* we need/think we need someone for two reasons:

1. Very often, people simply can't fulfill the very specific needs we have, which leads to disappointment, disillusionment, and sometimes can end relationships or friendships, when it doesn't have to be that way.

I'm very guilty of doing this, being upset that my husband or friends can't read my mind and know why I need them to treat me a certain way when, in fact, they're just struggling to get what *they* need from me as well. 

2. Being aware of all of this could lead to some very very productive conversations with those close to you. You can know who you feel safe discussing these very vulnerable feelings with, and maybe gain a much closer relationship with the people around you. Maybe you can even get them to tell you what purpose you serve to them!

______________________________________________


I'd maybe also look into ""love languages"" if you're still stuck. Whether or not the science is there, the 5 love languages are a simple summary of different ways people like to be treated, and what they may expect from others without even realizing it. 

Sources: lots of therapy and being a generally emotional bipolar person trying to make sense of it all.

My mother definitely struggles with something, maybe a milder bipolar, and she is a  woman of steel that tends to hide her feelings.

The most difficult time I think I had was after my very abusive stepfather passed away. My mother did her best to cope, but neither of us knew how to deal with the mixture of shock, relief, and loss of direction. He ran our lives like a military for 20 years and then while on a trip to another state, he suddenly died of a heart attack.

For about two years I had extremely vivid night terrors of him ""coming back"" to torture me. I became very suicidal and addicted to painkillers to distract myself. The self harm was real at this time. I also wouldn't sleep for as long as possible, making work next to impossible. 

I hate that he had such an effect on me. I hate that I wasn't just dancing for joy and freedom when he died. All of those confusing emotions were just too much for me.

I was not allowed to stay over at friends houses ever, they had to stay with us. Rules for how to dress, act, who to talk to, all were extremely strict. 

He did not have a job. He ran a fake business in another state and drained my mothers money. She worked two jobs in order to support us, and when I was old enough I started working too. With so little free time we were too tired to try and break the cycle. And to my mother, this is all America was.

You may need to get someone else involved, it sounds like. There's this thing my husband wanted to do, it's not an intervention, it's like... a party but you tell everyone ahead of time that you want them, at some point, to tell your gf why she matters to them. It can still be super casual so she doesn't feel attacked. Maybe on a birthday or family event, text the people that will be there that you need help lifting her up from this depression.

And maybe they can help you convince her to seek more outside help, like therapy or medication (which is surprisingly affordable if you go through walmart or kroger).

The point is you shouldn't be doing this alone, because just because you love someone doesn't mean it's your job to be their guard. It's taxing, unfair, and I can tell how much you really love her. You're doing a great job I think. But it's wearing you down too, and that isn't good for either of you.

*trigger warning, personal story coming*

For me, it didn't matter after a while what my husband said. I tried to cut myself super deep one day and the second I did... something clicked. I ran screaming out of the bathroom for my husband. He drove me to the ER. While they patched me up they said they might have to call police and commit me. 

I lost it. I couldn't bear to be apart from my roommates and husband, they were my family. I couldn't let my mom see me that way. Then I realized me dying would do all of those awful things but 1000x worse. I knew I had to change. I convinced them to give me one more chance and haven't been back since. I still mess up sometimes and self harm, but the thought of attempting to die was put out of my mind.

That's NO argument for letting an attempt happen, what I'm saying is find a way to show her everything and everyone she would miss, and who would miss her. Don't focus on the guilt of hurting people, focus on the great things she still wants to do, on any young people that might look up to her, that sort of thing. 

Even all the cool shit she will miss. Does she like movies or video games? That helped me too, like, if I died before the last Avengers movie came out what was I even born for, right? And all the new books that come out every day, all the art, the world is an amazing place just to look around in. There must be something she is looking forward to. Maybe something to do with animals or music? What if MCR finally reunites, huh? I want her to be here to see it."
