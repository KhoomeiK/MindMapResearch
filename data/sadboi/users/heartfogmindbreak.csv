WomensHealth,fqq96ab,t3_gk7z3d,1589561528.0,"If you are looking into getting tests for IBD / other GI problems involving inflammation, I highly recommend asking for a fecal calprotectin test.

You should also get tested for lactose and gluten intolerance (sorry if you already did this).

Skincare_Addiction,fqbb4uz,t1_fqaoigc,1589233772.0,I‚Äôd be careful where you‚Äôre sourcing from. Most of the media is focused on selling products and services to consumers. If you‚Äôre interested in actual science that‚Äôs going to be harder to find.
Skincare_Addiction,fqanzy6,t3_ggve2d,1589222307.0,"For a first step, I would say drink as much water as you can, clean twice a day (one cleanse could just be micellar water/ toner).

I am constantly kind of writhing in my own skin. I‚Äôm also really sensitive to smell and temperature. I have the same thing where I will feel like a smell is latching onto me and following me.

However, if she is mean, it could help to just imagine the anger is pain and not really directed at you.

mentalillness,fpl8ymn,t3_ge2r6g,1588708467.0,"This is extremely difficult for both of you. All she can ask of you is to be understanding and patient. You can‚Äôt take care of her or fix her, other than helping her with tasks that feel unmanageable. Get permission to talk to her medical/psych team if she‚Äôs ok with that. Don‚Äôt take it personally if she‚Äôs mean to you or pushes you away. Focus on taking care of yourself and try not to blame yourself for anything she‚Äôs going through.

BPD,foyd3nz,t3_ga8wg7,1588170309.0,"I am also having trouble finding pleasure. Maybe you could aim for something else‚Äî mastery/competence, mindfulness, distraction, soothing distress, focusing on someone else. For example: try to teach yourself a skill or build one you have. Do something nice for someone (send texts making sure people are ok during the pandemic, send letters or care packages, sew masks), exercise or go for walks, exercise WHILE watching the tv shows, draw/coloring book while watching tv shows, sometimes I have to do a few things at once. Listen to a podcast, draw. Journal listening to music. Take care of some indoor plants. Take up a skincare routine. Cook or bake while watching tv or listening to a podcast.

I think one way to look at it is, having and managing this mental illness IS A JOB, and a really challenging one. I think it‚Äôs the most important one to ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù or make progress in. If we can give ourselves credit for that, and focus on it as a first priority, then maybe the rest will follow. Or it won‚Äôt. Everyone requires different lifestyles to be happy.

And I think it‚Äôs MAD BRAVE that you are all here, self-aware and taking steps to fight this battle. I really appreciate that there is a community of people willing to step up and take on such a fight. You‚Äôre all tough as nails, and I have so much admiration for you.

Skincare_Addiction,fms9tbc,t3_fwwgca,1586350619.0,"Are you sure your skin is dry? It may be dehydrated. Or the new products you‚Äôre using are dehydrating it, sometimes skin will overproduce oil if it‚Äôs stripped too throughly of the natural oils.

Even if you hurt a lot of people, it wasn‚Äôt intentional and I hope you can learn to forgive yourself and not be so hard on yourself. I relate to all of this a lot and know how painful it is to live life feeling like you have committed unforgivable actions and that it‚Äôs your fault.
