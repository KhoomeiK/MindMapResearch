AmItheAsshole,fhhf7kq,t1_fhhdxt0,1581602739.0,I don't think anyone in their right mind would think that anyone is obligated to like someone else...has your friend expressed any specific positive or negative feelings with you about your friendship?
AmItheAsshole,fhhex9j,t3_f3ad3o,1581602530.0,"NTA - set your boundaries hard and fast now BEFORE baby gets here. Make sure you and hubby are a united front. Also, you need to go meet your new internet family over at r/JUSTNOMIL as they will help you every step of the way. 

ETA: it sounds like your hubby understands how inappropriate her behavior is, but if either of you need a reminder that it is okay to stand up for yourself against boundary stompers and drama creators, read this;  [https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont\_rock\_the\_boat/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/77pxpo/dont_rock_the_boat/)"
AmItheAsshole,fhheo4o,t3_f39uz9,1581602350.0,NTA - stop allowing these people to use you. They are not your friends.
AmItheAsshole,fhhdvz6,t3_f39xzu,1581601784.0,INFO - what else happened here? Seems like you're leaving out a lot of details. Are you just not going because you're not talking as frequently? And why the comment about how she's not forced to like you?
