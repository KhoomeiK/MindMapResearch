We aren’t entitled to what, exactly?
And most of the work? That’s humorous. 

But remember this: women have been treated like sex objects for god knows how long. Hundreds of years? Thousands? We have been raised to believe that we serve one purpose. And that purpose is sex. Despite the tremendous feats women have made in the past century, that is still engrained in our lives. Hardwired, if you will. The role isn’t flipped because it has ALWAYS been on the side of MEN. It’s about finding the clit because men have been under the impression it’s about how THEY feel (whether they realize or not). It’s about men not taking initiative, or even using common sense that spinning a DJ table on my pussy feels more like mutilation than music. It’s about them finishing and not even concerned about our pleasure. It’s about educating yourself on sex... unless you’re okay with being consistently lied to and told you made them come just to get it over with (and yes, women are so hardwired to try to be a great sex partner that even though the sex is terrible/uncomfortable, they simply just want the shit to end but don’t say anything) . But most importantly, it’s about women finally taking power - in and out of the bedroom. Men have always had power. Still do. It seems like you kinda prefer that. 


Oh, and by the way, I do so happen to be fantastic at giving blow jobs. Great critiques from very shitty artists though."

Don’t get confused though. It’s not like I don’t watch it when I come across straight porn that’s actually realistic and not painful to look at. 

If I were with a guy who watched gay porn, that’s fine with me lol. I honestly don’t care what they watch (as long as it’s not some shit that’s morally fucked up i.e. pedophilia/child pornography, etc.)

If this hypothetical guy and I have a good sexual relationship, that’s what matters. Masturbation is normal and healthy, and hey, whatever gets him going is his business! Because that’s his own personal preference when it comes to satisfying himself🤷🏼‍♀️"
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,fo8hair,t1_fo8am99,1587596536.0,"LOL. Not a lesbian. Straight porn is typically rough and often it’s *very* apparent the women are not having a good time. But that’s just from my own experience with (numerous) searches. Pulling up a video of a guy who legitimately looks like he’s destroying her body is not a turn on for me. But THAT kind of porn can be highly influential on a man’s idea of what sex is. 
I’ve been with 22 guys total in my life and I can honestly tell you that 4, MAYBE 5, of those guys “knew where the clit is.” The rest of them were obviously trying to mimic porn they’ve watched—they just didn’t know how to be fkn gentle with my lady parts. I’ve interrupted guys before and told them what they were doing was almost painful and definitely not pleasurable, then had to show them what to do. I hope the next sexual partner they had had a better time than I after that lol. 
You seem offended by the men-can’t-find-the-clit line. Sorry to offend if i did, but that line is frequently repeated by women... because it’s extremely common for men to not know shit about the female anatomy. 
Lesbian porn can be rough and can clearly show lack of enjoyment too, but it’s WAY easier to find what’s more realistic with lesbian porn. Especially when looking for porn that is mostly them going down on each other, which is my preference— i like for a guy to go down on me. I do not want to have sex with women; I’ve had opportunities to but I wasn’t turned on by the thought"

The 120-day ban on evictions in this state only applies to government subsidized housing and landlords with properties with federally-backed mortgages — so I’m not included in this. HOWEVER, even if they presented me with a notice (I haven’t paid rent yet bc my roommate was laid off in response to the virus), it would basically only be valid when the stay-at-home order is lifted on April 30 because the courts are closed. I’m pretty sure that order will be extended, too. Also... Idk how I would even move my things... I don’t have personal help and I don’t imagine moving companies are operating because, obviously, there’s a stay at home order. I’ve been looking at other places and no one is providing tours. Which is definitely understandable. 
There’s just so many things standing in the way of me moving. Could be a good or bad thing for me. 


I’d like to believe the landlords are being considerate, but I wouldn’t be surprised if they’re not. When they sent out an email saying the front office is closed etc, all they said in regards to rent was “don’t forget that you can pay online!!” 


I am going to call and ask about it because I haven’t gotten a response to my email explaining my situation and asking what their procedure is for tenants in my position.

bipolar,ffgh369,t1_ffggy0h,1579906083.0,Benadryl /: I actually need to go see my doctor about sleep medicine though because last week I didn’t sleep for two days and had to leave work early because I was so useless lol
bipolar,fejxuns,t1_fegyr60,1579188325.0,God it’s like I jinxed myself... I didn’t sleep last night either... two days no sleep fml
bipolar,fegxp8o,t1_fegxc53,1579104853.0,"No no you don’t sound like an ignorant asshat at all LOL! 
I’ve tried it before, many times actually. Hell, i tried last night! I can’t keep still for anything and I’ve tried it sitting up, laying down, during a bath... my mind just races on and on. 
I should’ve mentioned in my post that I do smoke before I go to bed as it helps me sleep and sleep well/throughout the night. But that doesn’t always work obviously lol."
bipolar,fegxcdx,t1_fegm7ms,1579104631.0,I agree. I need to say something. It’s almost like clockwork that these sleepless nights occur. I can guarantee at least one night out of a month I will not sleep. Maybe two but never back to back.
bipolar,fegx6su,t1_fegndiu,1579104535.0,"Oh for sure will need to try to do 20 minutes then try to sleep. Also, I probably will try reading a book I’ve read already. My friend recommended the Sleep With Me podcast."
bipolar,fegx1b9,t1_feguvre,1579104437.0,Agh I wish I could do that. I just end up getting pissed off and my thoughts start racing -_-
BipolarMemes,feemzh9,t1_feemsee,1579037036.0,I actually face palmed when it hit me the following day
bipolar,feajcqr,t3_enyftw,1578949572.0,Thank you for posting this. I’ve had such a difficult time applying for graduate school. This gave me a push.
TheGirlSurvivalGuide,feagsky,t3_eo57sr,1578948588.0,"Check out r/abortion. Literally the most supportive, helpful and informative community. I had an abortion in 2018 and still frequent that sub. Not to say this sub isn’t helpful— r/abortion may just have further insight! 
If you ever need to talk or get advice, PM me :) I’ve been there and I know that it can be a very confusing and difficult time."
BipolarMemes,fdgy803,t1_fdgh2jy,1578411242.0,I ask my brain that every day
bipolar,fclznmw,t1_fclymeq,1577760429.0,I do. That’s why it gets hard for me to sleep. It’s quiet but my brain is LOUD.
