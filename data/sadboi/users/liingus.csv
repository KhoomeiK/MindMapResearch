I agree they playstyles of some of these characters are more efficient on other characters, but the same goes for a huge majority of the cast too. A good landmark of a top tier is that they are able to be played successfully with very many different playstyles and characters like wolf palu and lucina all can take over roles that are traditionally used by lower tiered characters more efficiently"
SmashBrosUltimate,fbyr19s,t3_eegk4f,1577224052.0,"Trust me I know the pain of mewtwo lol but he is crazy underdeveloped and saying he doesn’t have kill confirms is just a flat lie, killing is the last thing mewtwo struggles with, it’s not getting killed that’s the real issue with him. 
Ike does have counterplay but then so does literally every other character hence why no character is way above anyone else, Ike is a very one dimensional character but when that one dimension is as insanely good as his he’s still a very strong character, melee puff is a great example of a character being very one dimensional but still an insanely strong threat just because they are so good at the one thing they do. 
Cloud is definitely not near what he was in 4 but he’s still very good, great damage no problems killing at all and a massive sword, which is actually just as big if not bigger than most other swords in the game besides nair, are great for him. Just having a bad recovery doesn’t make a character bad, his recovery is literally exactly the same as it was in 4. 
Coming from a former shoto player, 99% of the smash community grossly underestimates ryu, he is literally the exact same as ken besides having a less explosive strings in exchange for a wildly better zoning game and more reliable kill options. I believe ken is better than ryu but only by at most 2 or 3 spots, there is zero reason they should be placed any further apart than that. Everyone just thinks ryu is bad because they don’t know anything about him and just assume ken is way better because they don’t see anyone talking about ryu. Thank you for being civil about this discussion lots of Reddit drones think someone disagreeing with them is a personal attack, I hope I could show you my way of thinking for a few of these placements"
