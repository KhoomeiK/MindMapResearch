depression,fi092m0,t1_fi03ak1,1582030662.0,"To be honest. I never did wanna leave school for the reason of wanting to be a ""grownup."" I wanted to leave school so I could go straight into the work force and help pay for my family's bills cuz I felt like a burden on my family.

Now 7 years after high school, I wish I never felt like a burden to my family. It's just me and my mom now, my grandma passed away a couple years ago. And now I wish I went to college earlier in life rather than just working. To think that it was hard to pay bills back then is laughable. It's harder to pay the bills now, especially since I'm also going to college now compared to back then. Working multiple jobs while going to school sucks"

depression,ffq8imk,t3_euicer,1580125891.0,"Not gonna lie. I saw this post as I was scrolling through reddit. And I have never found such a relatable post. So much in fact that I read every single comment and felt glad that I wasnt the only one who feels this way. It's kinda comforting in a way....

Especially when it feels like when no one in the world who would understand how I felt, and then theres this post that made me feel... a little bit normal. It sucks feeling like I'm always the supporting character and yet no one else would have my back"

istp,f3weguo,t3_digxem,1571199592.0,"Up until recently, I honestly never felt ""love"" like how everyone else described it to be. Like wanting to marry someone because they connected so well or whatever. It was always hard to find someone to really connect to and open up to tbh... even with my friends, I never really ""missed"" them more like just the company of them. I do appreciate how well we know each other and our friend dynamic is tho.

But recently I found someone that I have just clicked with the instant we met and the instant we both opened our mouths. I dont think I've opened up to someone this much before, it's a really nice feeling to understand what books and movies talk about now. I definitely think, after meeting her, that there is someone out there for each and every one of us... Maybe it's not even someone else, but it could be that the person out there that is for you is yourself.

Maybe I'm gushing a little too much or romanticizing things a little too much. Who knows lol"
depression,eyrz97n,t3_cyekdj,1567382544.0,"I actually feel the same way. Like yes (insert mundane thing here) helps with depression. But its not like it fucking gets rid of it. It just helps ease it up a little, but that's pretty much it. The depression is still there, it's still nagging at your thoughts, and it never goes away. Everything else kinda feels like distractions at this point"
depression,eyfk9k0,t1_eycjerm,1567050142.0,I relate to this comment so much
perfectloops,exdgql4,t3_cs0lgm,1566176214.0,"This deserves all the upvotes in the world. Like all the other people in the comments, I kept watching, for who knows how long, waiting to see who would win... then I saw the subreddit lol"

depression,ewn904h,t3_cp1ajy,1565571796.0,"I think the thing I hate is that when I finally do meet someone I can feel like I belong with them or I can be comfortable with..... theres always complicated situations surrounding that person where it hurts to keep them in your life (jealous friends, or they move away, controlling SO, etc). Does anyone else have this happen to them or is it just me? I feel like I'm looking in the wrong places but at the same time, it's rare that I genuinely connect with people and its smarter to just not associate with them because it hurts me more."
depression,evnkfkn,t1_evm21f6,1564626662.0,"This is probably one of the few things someone else has said where I agree with 100%. I've always felt this way when it comes to my perspective on life (as bleak as it is). This is what drags me into the more ""depressive state"" I find myself in, and this is what also helps me on those days as well"
TooAfraidToAsk,eusuwib,t3_chb2p2,1564014074.0,"I'm pretty sure the people who attack you on reddit fall into one of these categories:
1) those who are experiencing a hard time in life so they run to reddit and attack others to make themselves feel better
2) those who feel ""above the rest"" and just want to be better than anyone
3) trolls
4) sitting in their parents basement
5) or have too much time on their hands

So dont take everything TOO seriously. Just take everything with a grain of salt or just brush it off"
depression,euclf6m,t1_euckg1o,1563678504.0,That the fact that they wont truly understand makes me feel a little bit more lonely. I know. It sounds a bit dumb
depression,euajqkh,t1_euaj0l9,1563621947.0,"They dont make me feel lonely to be honest. It's more of a ""they'll never truly understand how I feel"" kind of thing. Or sometimes I kinda just wanna be with my friends and just not talk and enjoy their company, if that makes sense.

Like when I put a fake smile on and i kinda just go with the flow, one or two of them pull me on the side to ask me if I'm okay sometimes. And I say sometimes because they know I dont like it if I draw any unwanted attention. It just makes me feel worse."
depression,euaizq2,t1_euaimur,1563620973.0,"Honestly, just knowing that someone else had these kind of thoughts cheered me up a bit.

depression,euaihu8,t1_euaidbt,1563620271.0,"Omfg, I relate to this so much. Sometimes I wish my good friend had depression as well so they can just like understand. But then I'm like ""no, dont do that. You're being dumb lol. Stop trying to wish depression on (insert friends name here)"" lol"

depression,euai4lz,t1_eu9r15p,1563619747.0,"This is also me. I even have thoughts where I go ""I wasnt diagnosed with depression"", so I'm not actually depressed.

istp,eu4q7bz,t3_ces3k5,1563460654.0,"I currently use social media to keep up with things. For example, facebook I follow local news stations and I use Instagram to keep an eye on any sales that local stores have. I've found that businesses often use Instagram to advertise their sales. It's really useful when I need something and I just check a stores instagrams page for a sale. Other than that, for the memes of course.

Because let's be real. No one genuinely cares about what you post on social media. Even if something horrible happened to you, the people who actually cared wouldve called, texted, or showed up at your place when they heard the news. Not just drop a comment/dislike or something. Unless it's a meme. Everyone genuinely cares about memes"

 Leaving a text or message on ""read"" and then replying later doesn't really affect me though. Leaving a message or text on ""read"" doesn't really bother me at all actually, depending on the conversation. Because I know that sometimes its hard to think of a reply for EVERYTHING. But if its left on ""read"" after i asked a question or their input, then I instantly get irritated."
