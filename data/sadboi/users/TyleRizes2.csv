 Also, key word you used, try. In art you don't try, you just do. I went through art college and I was a pretty mediocre student. i tried too hard on everything just to impress and as a result I didnt do anything noteworthy during that time, I didn't impress anyone, my work was just OK.Stop trying, just do, be silly, make something silly.

As for Kamogawa is giving his pupils hard grueling training, mastering the basics and coming up with training menus before hand to battle an opponent. (Mostly in Ippos case, training to dodge Ozuma's hook, Volg endurance match and built his body like a titanium armor for fight against submarine guy) Now, where he lacks which baffles me, is coming up with strategies at the moment of act, during matches. This is the flaw in Kamogawa, he sees an opponent do the unexpected and his mind just simply turns off and he leaves it to his boxer to figure out for himself what to do. He could not even come up with a viable strategy against David Eagle, Takamura had to. And not noticing Ippo's denying the fundamental of boxing and relying it all on Dempsey roll makes him a pretty bad coach when it comes to the mental psyche of his athlete. 

Self-opinion: As Kamogawa took Takamura and made a World Champion out of him (even though Takamura is godly gifted, he needed the discipline to reach the ultimate height) thanks to the grueling training he put on Takamura. Date Eiji could easily make a world champion out of Ippo if he were his coach since Date could fill the more in-depth technical aspects of boxing which Kamogawa nor Ippo reach and make the best out of him."

And most of all he became the Japanese Champion. 

Up to that point, it was perfect and it could have ended there. Even if he continued boxing rather than retire and marry Kumi and continue his life as a fisherman, he could a become a sure world champion. 

But the author decided to stumble and bring the shyness of the character again just to keep the manga running.
