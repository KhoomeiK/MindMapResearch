i’m now the designated DD for everyone and most people respect that. i’ll take some snacks or a soda on a night out over the days of excruciating pain afterwards any day."

this child is supposed to be her son, blood or not. there should never be a situation in which she doesn’t want him included."

AmItheAsshole,f7cmtub,t3_dv9ogm,1573595680.0,"YTA. I want to tell you about my mother. She did exactly what you asked of your sister-in-law. She carried a child for her brother because he and his wife couldn’t have a baby. Carried her for 9 months and gave her to him at the hospital. Despite not wanting the child herself, the postpartum was brutal. She had a mental breakdown to the point of having the cops called at one point. She still talks about my cousin all the time and for her own mental health hasn’t seen her in years now. You need to consider what you’re asking of your husband’s sister because that’s a huge proposal. It’s not just a vacant uterus, she’s a person. You’ve vastly overstepped your bounds and should have, at the very least, gotten the details of what “not wanting kids” means to her."

schizophrenia,f187ju2,t3_d82zra,1569253723.0,"first of all, i’m sorry about how unsupportive your support system is. i hope things start to get better in that regard.

most of my hallucinations are auditory and olfactory also. i rarely have visual ones, those are only when things get kind of deep fried. luckily i have dogs though. so i can judge if anything is actually going on based on their reactions. if they don’t react then it’s probably me. i also almost always have headphones but i don’t recommend that really. auditory will sometimes bleed through that and make it distinguishable. smells are harder to do. i have a bad one with smelling natural gas; i’m still working out how to weed that one out.

delusions are harder for me. i don’t have any good techniques for those unfortunately. sometimes it’s getting creative with what’s available to you in a safe way. i hope you’re able to find some things that work for you."

schizophrenia,ey3vewj,t3_cv5ls1,1566774731.0,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I’ve lost my brother and a few friends to suicide, I know it can be a long and painful healing process. Sometimes only time can help. 
Do something he’d enjoy in his memory. Be gentle with yourself in your time of grieving and surround yourself with loved ones. And also, it’s important for you to know that you were a great friend and you did a great job trying to help him, even if you start doubting yourself for a while."
