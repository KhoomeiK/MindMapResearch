Coldplay,f81j14i,t3_dye2uo,1574169005.0,"Gosh, I can't listen to ""What If"" because it came up on shuffle my senior year of high school when my dad was driving me to a study group. I didn't even notice that he'd started crying because he started connecting the song with me going to college (""What if you decide you don't need me anymore?'). It was like, the second time I'd seen him cry my entire life, so now I can't hear it without feeling this intense mixture of panic, guilt and helplessness."
AskReddit,f4uz9rf,t3_dlrz06,1571833664.0,"Most of mine are self inflicted (1 year and 10 months clean!), but my ""favorite"" one is the one my littlest brother gave me. I think he was about 9 and we were playing in my parents' room, when he nearly falls off the side of the bed. He was kind of a scaredy-cat so he panicked and grabbed my hand, and one of his fingernails went through the back of my hand.
The thing is though as he's gotten older, he's grown, and now he wouldn't be able to make that same shape anymore. He's also gotten more independent. So I feel it's a nice ""memento"" of when he was young, and when he needed me more.

...though as I was typing this he texted me asking me to drop off his lunchbox because he'd forgotten it, I guess he will always need me! :)"

The kid replied, ""It's on the back."""
