I’m glad you have your husband for support, I find it helps so much having someone to talk to. There should never be guilt involved in slipping up or having a treat. 
The reason I ask about the numbers is because when I’ve gone for it 100% in the past I found eventually my weight kind of plateaus although I can still see some change in mirror/clothes which i know is more important. I just get attached to the seeing them numbers go down 🙈

WeightLossAdvice,fq9az8v,t3_ghe9gc,1589192013.0,"My go-tos when I’m on the snack attack hype: 

1. Protein shake. I mix vanilla protein with almond milk and frozen fruit (usually mango or some tropical smoothie mix) it’s so filling and tastes so good.  

2. Green smoothie. I like spinach, pears, apples, lemons, etc. Surprisingly tasty and filling! You can experiment with cinnamon, tumeric etc, til you find a combination you like. Literally just chuck healthy stuff in the blender with some water, milk or fruit juice and you’re good to go. Very low calorie, filling and healthy. 

3. Skyr yoghurt is amazingly high protein and you can mix it with whatever you want. Super filling! Harder to snack when you’re genuinely full. 

Obviously we’re stuck at home right now so we’re adjusting to a new way of living/eating. Experiment and find what works for you. If you’re constantly wanting snacks are your main meals nourishing and satisfying enough? Do you have enough fats and proteins in your diet or mainly carbs? (Not saying carbs are bad- but just that they can be less satisfying!) 

Also are you letting yourself get too hungry between meals? So when you realise you need to eat you feel you need to eat NOW 😂 which leads to grabbing the quickest thing that normally comes in the form of an unhealthy snack!I’ve done this plenty of times! In this case maybe some kind of rough meal planning would help, even if it’s just the times you plan to eat your meals. 

Also stock up on things you know you like that are good for you and are very quick to prepare and stop buying the things you know you eat when you’re bored. You don’t have to cut them out completely, I went from eating chocolate every day to once a week doing this. Once i realised the chocolate wasn’t  going anywhere it was easier not to have it all the time. 

The other thing is if it’s more psychological/boredom then ask yourself if you’re really hungry, or if you’re snacking so you don’t have to cook. I used to dislike cooking because I believed I wasn’t good at it. The truth was I hadn’t practised it. Getting better at preparing food is a bit like betting into shape, it’s something no one ever regrets doing. So now could be a great time to improve. For me it doesn’t need to be fancy, just relatively quick, healthy and most importantly delicious. As this way of eating leaves me satisfied and not feeling like I’ve missed out!"

Eventually I found “mum” in my phone book and called her and she took me to hospital. I’m five years seizure free now and slowly deceasing meds. The things that have helped me the most were:

•going back to my neuro and asking for higher does/switch medication until we found one that worked 

•taking my medication properly (I take it first thing in the morning and have an alarm set for every night so I always take it at the same time)

•getting good quality regular sleep

•avoiding stress as much as possible 

•talking/writing about experiences like you are doing here now, I think this is so important 

•working on my anxiety with a therapist (stress, emotion and anxiety were definitely triggers for me)

•when I could feel a seizure was coming on, trying to remain as calm as I could and reassure myself that I was safe and would be waking up afterwards tired but unharmed (this was really hard but it seemed to make my grand mal seizures less severe) 

•allowing as much rest as I needed  

I definitely recommend trying all of these things, we are all different but those are the things that helped me a lot. I know it’s really scary but things can get better, hang in there. You’re not alone."

We don’t point at people’s eczema/rosacea/hives/psoriasis etc and tell them to eat a healthy diet and meditate. Those are great things to do but they aren’t necessarily effective treatments. The wellness industry has a lot to answer for! 

Studies in fact show that diet has very little to do with it with the exception of dairy which makes a difference for a tiny percentage of the population. Sadly there is evidence some acne sufferers have a tendency to restrict themselves from entire food groups and/or normally enjoyable foods, which can have devastating effects on physical and mental health and so people bringing up diet really is unwarranted.

1. Stay online; Reddit is great for providing some human interaction. 

2. Are you living with anyone else? If not is there anyone you could arrange a phone call or FaceTime with? Old friends/Family member? Could you make it regular? 

3. Utilise your daily outing as much as you feel up to it, and try to go to a park/somewhere with nature, and grab the opportunity while the sun is shining 

4. Use all the free workouts personal trainers are giving on Instagram to increase your endorphins; maybe design a routine that incorporates walk, workout, FaceTime, healthy eating etc. 

5. Eat lots of “happy” foods if you have access to them- quick list 
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/307583001

6. Get in touch with a therapist if affordable/available and not doing so already; if not, journaling?  

7. Put something light-hearted/funny on tv as background noise- I live alone and do this all the time. It really makes the house seem like a happier place. 

8. Plan for the future: what would would you like your life to look like when things go back to normal, or in a few years? This can give hope and something to feel motivated for. Remember you deserve that life and you can get there. You will get through this. 

Basically utilise everything you have access to, social support is important and this is a really tough situation for everyone. The good news is you were making progress so hopefully with practical steps that can be maintained. I’m really sorry about the timing. Do NOT be down on yourself if you happen to go “backwards”; it’s natural to feel down right now. 

Keep an eye on your mood and if you feel it’s declining get in touch with GP to discuss strategies or dose adjustment if necessary. You are supported and you will get through this!"

Epilepsy,fm149he,t3_fsdliv,1585671722.0,"Hi 😊

I should think it’s still worth trying to see your neuro, or at least getting onto a waiting list. 

You absolutely can grow out of epilepsy and lots of  children do. It’s quite common ~7/10 

There is something called syncope, brief loss of consciousness. This is not a type of epilepsy. It’s usually caused by low blood pressure, e.g. when standing up too quickly and the blood being pumped by the heart can’t make it in time to the brain. The person then feels dizzy or blacks out but very quickly recovers.

There is also convulsive syncope, which is like a cross between syncope and epilepsy. It’s the blacking out accompanied by some “tonic” (rigidity, stiffness) or “myoclonic” (involuntary twitching/jerking) symptoms. 

Side note: Children can also suffer from seizures known as febrile convulsions which is not a form of epilepsy. The child suffering febrile concussions will have a seizure when they are too hot, e.g. when suffering from an infection that causes a temperature but they do not necessarily go on to develop epilepsy. 

For epileptic seizures, there are partial and generalised seizures. Partial affect only one part of the brain; they will cause various symptoms depending on which part of the brain is affected, however they  don’t cause loss of consciousness, so far as I can find.

Generalised seizures are the ones which affect the whole brain, and this type of seizure can cause loss of consciousness. There are a few different types of generalised  seizures but the ones which can definitely cause loss of consciousness include:

Absence: it looks like a staring spell which can be mistaken for daydreaming, lasts for a few seconds and alertness comes back straight away 

Tonic: muscles stiffen followed by loss of consciousness 

Tonic-clonic: stiff muscles, loss of consciousness and jerking, what most people think of as an epileptic seizure (“fit” used to refer to the same thing but is not a preferred term anymore). The person is very tired afterwards and needs rest. 

I hope this helps, and good luck 💗"

steroidsxx,fk7a87f,t3_fgs1et,1583931897.0,"Hi, similar situation with losing weight while developing ED. Stopped starving myself but developed horrible eating habits (including binging) which I now realise was driven by fatigue from my need to control my diet so vigorously. 

I would recommend reading up about intuitive eating. The Goddess Revolution by Mel Wells is a great place to start as it’s available on audible (I’m not much of a “reader”) and explains everything simply. She also has google talks and ted talks if you want to try free content first but I highly recommend the book. It’s helped me loads and I’m only half way through. I’ve turned off notifications from my fitness pal, stopped weighing food, stopped weighing myself, stopped stressing if I miss one workout, and my boyfriend and I both agree I look better within just a few weeks. 

My tummy fat is also my problem area but it’s decreasing now I’m getting more veggies and not tracking/stressing. Stressing over your food constantly will negatively affect your hormones and put fat on your stomach. You have to stop stressing. If this means not tracking food for a while (or permanently) its worth a try, right? Once you have your diet back to normal, then you can think about adding in extra things to give you a boost (like when a coach refuses to train injured athlete until they are fully recovered - we need to fix the fundamentals first). But you also might not want to anymore. See how it goes. Best of luck 😊- pizza every night is not the way forward. You deserve so much more!"
