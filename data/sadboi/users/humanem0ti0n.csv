BPD,fm62pri,t3_ftb3r8,1585785034.0,"I’m actually doing okay and I think the only reason is because I’ve been journaling since I completed therapy a few weeks ago. No matter a good day or a bad day I’m writing it down so I can try to understand my feelings better and it gives me something to look back on; if I’m having a bad day I can see that good days do happen and I’ve had worse bad days before now, and by reading the happy days I can remind myself what I love about my life and what I am grateful for. It also helps to remind me that if I’m sad it won’t last forever (I’m a big fan of catastrophising and thinking once I’m upset I’ll be depressed forever). I hope this helps someone. Stay safe x"
AskWomen,flvqvj1,t3_fr5yxg,1585529981.0,"I ended a stagnant relationship, I saved half of my wages each month until I could put a deposit down on a house, I stopped taking antidepressants and I forced myself to tackle the negative “what if’s” in my mind and counteract them with positive ones instead. I also made a point of reciprocating the effort I receive from others instead of constantly initiating contact or trying to make plans. It sounds so simple but it’s a work in progress and my brain feels a lot less cluttered now and I’m looking forward to my future with myself as the centre of my attention."
BPD,flvpw5f,t3_framg2,1585529319.0,"I get this a lot but I also really fear being completely alone because I know deep down isolating is not a healthy thing for me... Idk if this would help you but I curb this feeling by taking myself away if I can afford to so I have the excuse that I’m away (i.e no one bother me) and I may not have signal (the perfect excuse to not reply to anyone if you don’t want to without damaging relationships). 

Being away from everyone for a few days and nights really resets this feeling for me and of course if I change my mind I can always come home early. Added bonus is you get to explore cool places and make memories with no one to taint them- last month I stayed in a windmill I found on Airbnb and it was the best thing I’ve done for myself in a long time."
BPD,fgk4d0o,t3_eywwub,1580857221.0,"I fully identify with this and know how you feel. I read up about BPD and other people’s experiences with it and I’m ticking all the boxes only I don’t really have any past trauma per se which makes me feel completely fraudulent in my feelings, emotions, thought processes etc. I also often fantasise about being hurt (eg crashing my car is a frequent one) so other people think I’m valid in my emotions rather than just for no reason. I wish I knew what I could say to make it better but I suppose at least you know you’re not alone."
AskReddit,fg53kfh,t3_ewbty3,1580517407.0,"Had a threesome with some of my brother’s friends (one male -let’s call him A, one female -let’s call her B) and a guy I’d known since I was 5 years old from school- he can be C (for cunt- you’ll see why). So originally it was meant to be four of us but C couldn’t get hard; we were all drunk, so it turned into the threesome with C just kind of watching?

me and B were having a fine time, then me and A were having sex. Now A’s been friends with my brother for years and so known me since I was maybe 11? Anyway, while he’s balls deep he says something to the effect of “I’ve wanted to do this for ages”. Well B leaves the room crying, turns out she’s in love with A (they now live together and have two kids). A goes to console her, they leave and I stay with C in his house. The next morning C sexually assaulted me. What started off as a really sexy and fun time went downhill FAST for everyone involved."
AskWomen,fd6m0to,t3_ejvkej,1578192949.0,I frequently fantasise about being able to take off my boobs so I can sleep on my stomach comfortably like I used to. Would also be useful for the gym.

No job that causes you so much unhappiness that it makes you ill is worth it. Remember that it’s not a reflection on you either, you’ve done whatever you could to offer those kids a better future. Good luck to you in whichever path you choose to take :)"
