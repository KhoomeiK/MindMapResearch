As far as no one having the money right now. I hate to say it but life isn't going to go back to normal. If we lifted all bans right now, do you think you'd see crowded restaurants etc?

No. The only thing that will save people's asses is to lower fixed costs - i.e leases, rent, property tax, mortage payment, because land owners are the only ones making it out ahead here. As it stands everyone is about to go bankrupt, and healthcare workers are dying which makes me weary as well at the idea of everyone going out again and business as semi usual."

I also am concerned about how contagious it is, and what its lasting effects are, especially if our body doesn't actually rid itself of the virus i.e people testing positive again - potential for dormancy.
