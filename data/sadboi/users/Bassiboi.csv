poetry_critics,fiz7cwj,t3_famqhr,1582855885.0,"I like the meta. Poems about poems are fun. To add a little punch, you might consider a rhyme on the last line, or maybe change the second to last line if you really are attached to the closer. I definitely don't think it's super important though if you like it, especially because most of the rhymes aren't perfect rhymes and the poem as a whole definitely works without it. 

I really like the image that appears in my head too. Shoestrings, locked doors, and all of the grammatical metaphors remind me of high school in a really fun way."

Tomato sauce is what I put on pasta, and (to my knowledge) has no vinegar, and generally has olive oil and garlic powder in it."

iamatotalpieceofshit,erytrzj,t1_eryrkod,1561417243.0,"I can see your point there, however I would keep in mind that I'm pretty sure paramilitary groups aren't illegal in America (see organizations like Blackwater). Also, I'm not sure how long they waited really matters. Its unclear who fired first in the second standoff, but a lot of the third party witness testimomies make it seem like government agents fired first.


Well, depending on how deep you want to go, there are a lot of interesting court transcripts that contradict both the government's official story and the surviving cult member's official stories that can be found on the fbi's website, though it can be a little dry. Check them out here:
https://vault.fbi.gov/waco-branch-davidian-compound


Theres also an interesting article originally published in the Dallas Morning News that described the contents of numerous FBI wiretaps that can be found here: 
https://culteducation.com/group/1220-waco-davidians/24139-excerpts-of-disputed-transcripts-.html


Finally, theres a great biography by Biographics about David Koresh's life. Keep in mind, most of it is about his life before the raid, but the last bit has some details about his involvement in the standoff.

iamatotalpieceofshit,erypiqj,t1_erym38j,1561414103.0,"The cult held children as hostages and the government basically just said Fuck 'em, and blew a huge hole in the compound. Then they set it on fire without evacuating the children. Needlessly endangering a ton of people who were neither at fault for the siege nor actively standing against the government. Not only that, but peace talks were in the works when they started blowing shit up.


Not saying the cultists were in the right, far from it, statutory rape is basically the worst thing a group of people can do, but the government definitely didn't handle it right. In the end 76 people died, many of whom were not responsible for the criminal activity perpetrated on the compound and were being used as meat shields by Koresh. Generally, when an agent says fuck the hostages imma blow some shit up, people arent going to be happy.

There's also an issue reguarding the government's use of military tactics on civilians. The use of psychologically damaging techniques like the playing of loud noises to prevent sleep and such, which depending on your point of view could be seen as may be considered cruel and unusual punishment during an arrest."
nonononoyes,er8pi99,t3_c0wl7t,1560609274.0,I am 100% on board with this. Imagine sitting at a table only to be told be a neighboring patron the people before had their dirty ass shoes all up on that shit.
