I've seen a lot about that book! I'll definively check it out."
dragonlance,fr679i6,t1_fr671rg,1589921143.0,I will add them to the list thank you! My plan is to first read all the books by tracy and margaret and then maybe venture out to those you mentioned. What is your favourite book of the series?

NTA for enforcing your rules. You gave her a warning and she didn't listen, she knew she wasn't allowed to have pets in the home.

YTA for still kicking her out amids this outbreak. Give her another warning or let het pay extra/a fine for the time being. Then, after the pandemic if she still hasn't gotten rid of the cat evict her."
