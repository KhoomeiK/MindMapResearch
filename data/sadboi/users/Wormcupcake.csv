ChronicPain,fhg2llu,t3_f30q1t,1581557134.0,"There's definitely something to be said for how ACT and mindfulness can help chronic pain sufferes. I do a lot of mediation and a lot of mindfulness and DBT for my mental health issues which I've started to apply for my chronic pain and for me it helps, not as much as my drugs and physical therapy but it gives my mind some ease when everything else is on fire. But that's me, every client is different, pushing a client into something they've shut down several times is not okay. 


You know yourself best and it's incredibly tiring constantly having to give reasons for not wanting to do this physical therapy or try this drug, it's your body. People assume you will try absolutely anything and everything to get rid of your pain and look at you like you're crazy for not wanting to drink this specific type of tea because their great grandma had the same pain I did so it'll work for you for sure! 


I refused to see a chriopractor despite my parents trying their hardest to get me to see theirs. I've been to chiros and they don't help, why push something on me when I've said no?

Outlander,f9iy217,t1_f9gvxqs,1575349187.0,"Mmm... But she'd be leaving a younger Bree.. of she left earlier before Frank died (which Claire would never do because a) Bree b) she promised C) she would still feel like she owned loyalty to Frank) then Bree would be left with no parents once Frank died, I can't imagine Claire's relationship with Bree would last if she tired to tell Bree her real father is Jamie while Frank was still alive, because Bree is nothing short of loyal either and would flat out not believe Claire. Even she got Bree to the stones Claire would never risk that for Bree. 


Say Claire found Jamie before Frank died, she tells Bree, Bree doesn't believe her, Claire goes anyway that would mean Bree wouldn't ever think to look for Claire and Jamie in the past and find out about the fire. 
It would mean Bree never meets Roger. 
Her relationship with Claire would be in tatters because Claire abandoned her. 
Frank died, Bree is all alone and she won't ever be a main character. 



If Jamie does try to leave a message it would mean Claire living in more of a hell than she already is with a broken heart. She's been able to get through life believing Jamie was dead, so she could become a doctor, a mother and a friend. 



Claire isn't just a character built so we can witness love between two people, she's a fully fleshed out person who I think even if she knew Jamie was alive, wouldn't go back while she had a career she loved, Frank was still alive and Bree was still quite young. 



It's nice to think that they could've had more time together but honestly I love Claire and Jamie more in the older books. They're older, wiser and age has cleared away a lot of reservations Claire or Jamie would've had about certain events/situations."

I'm still able to do my physio but not any of the more strenuous exercises. I guess thinking and really I was lead to believe that Botox was a cure for me if it worked.. I think I'm just going to have to find a neurologist privately.

Outlander,f6kt13u,t1_f6j817q,1572920007.0,"I don't think she would've gone back. He sent her away because of what they knew would happen after Culloden. Not just the killing but the huge famine and the massive English presence in the highlands. 

If she had come back, pregnant, they would've most likely been questioned just as hard as Ian had been while Jamie was in hiding. I doubt Claire could've hidden in the cave with Jamie either, not with a baby.  So Jamie would've been compelled to give himself up a lot earlier because child and wife were still in danger and possibly would've ended up hanged. 

Claire staying in the 20th century was the best move possible and if Jamie had left an international message after Culloden and she'd found it and known she couldn't go back not just for the reasons above but also if Bree was small, she never would've left her or considered bringing her through the stones. I think it would've slowly killed her knowing Jamie was alive and she couldn't be with him. 

Maybe he could've made.more noise when he got released from helwater, but Claire only looked when Frank died anyway."

 I think if we were financially stable in our early 20s (now 27) we'd have been married around 23/24. For us marriage makes life a bit easier because I get sick a lot and I am not always on the best terms with my family but it's never been a huge thing we *need* it's just nice. 

It is young to get married but hey, everyone is different and you know yourselves best. Something to consider would be marriage counseling, it can help get your head around any issues in the relationship and puts you in a healthy pathway for communication!
