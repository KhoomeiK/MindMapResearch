I just feel like I'm empty and without purpose, a corpse that constantly struggles with the idea of just disappearing because I wouldn't be giving up, if I don't really have anything not even friends tying be to this life. I just don't know what to do or why I'm here, but for some reason I still have hope, you should have some hope and patience even if it hurts, someday everything will change... Or at least that's what everyone else says..."
