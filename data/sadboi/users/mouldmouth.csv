OP, you're looking for your deep connection in the wrong place. Dating apps aren't for deep connection.

Manage your expectations. You need to have patience and try to adapt. People are craving connection perhaps more than ever before, you're just being too rigid about finding it in a way that you're used to.

World moved on even when you were young, now you're just old enough to have a reference point. You need to lean into people, not expect them to lean to you. Part of it is accepting that you need to learn to cut your losses with people that aren't looking for what you're looking for and not take it as a sign of overarching shift in human temperament."

I often can go from relaxed to anxious when I cannot express my thoughts in words or if others start misunderstanding, interrupting, or I feel like I'm taking too long to explain myself.

Personally I feel like it's just down to the way I think. My thinking is quite narrative sometimes but often times it's not - like you said I'm an associative thinker too. I call it relational thinking - my mind is like a map that I'm constantly building... I have very easy time learning things that my map supports but sometimes it's very hard to simplify something enough to talk about it coherently.

I usually counteract this by writing about something to myself before I talk to others about it. This way I don't need to do the ""translation"" process on the spot but I can refer to the memory of how I worded things to myself.

A lot of western societies overvalue logic and reasoning and undervalue emotional intelligence and empathy. Your friend may *feel* justified *feeling* superior about their chosen interests because of this, but being condescending towards your interests is just a sign of immaturity and a massive gap in their supposed superior reasoning. 

If they're actually nihilistic they should understand that nothing is inherently more valuable than anything else, engineering and social sciences included. There's no use for aeronautical engineering without a civilised society, and being civilised mostly rests on people that care about human systems and human values. They're just parroting the popular idea that only STEM fields are worth studying, but that doesn't hold up to real scrutiny at all.

I rather see less of them than see them when I would default to too much mirroring.

Ideally this means that when I have less energy to maintain the friendship, they already know me well enough that we can work around it.

I'm not too fussed about labels but demisexual and pansexual both describe my experience most accurately. Sometimes when I'm splitting hard I daydream about running off with women and how much better my life would be... even though I rationally know that's not how it works at all. It's just temporary though, just fantasy that helps to cope with the helpless feelings.

Try to think of it this way... So maybe it turns out that you're not attracted to men anymore. But you can do something about that later. There's no rush. The most pressing issue right now is to focus on fixing whatever made you split on your partner so that you can have overall healthier perspective. If he's someone that you value in general, you don't want to end the relationship while you're splitting anyway. Odds are that your attraction will come back when your feelings about him and the relationship change. They've always come back for me, even though there's been times I've feared I've gone from borderline sex addicted to having no sexual feelings at all!

What is important is using whatever diagnoses you have to find the kinda treatment that helps you with your collection of problems.

I know there's a lot of negativity and despair circulating when it comes to BPD, but I think that's simply cause of a lack of understanding of the condition.

I've learned to ask for exact actions that I know will help me, and that is usually mutually satisfying.

I cannot speculate about your INFJ or your relationship, but I can say that creating distance can also be a sign of fear or apprehension. The feelings are too much to bear, and there's a fear of no reciprocation or damaging what has already been built etc. It could be anything depending on the individual. My point being, it's not always a sign of not wanting to build the relationship. We need distance and solitude in order to be objective, maybe more than most.

I completely understand what you mean by the physical aspect. I'd never experienced the kinda ""mind blowing passion"" before I found my current partner that I am attracted to intellectually, emotionally, and physically.

Children love their parents unconditionally, which means that only people that are capable of loving their children unconditionally are emotionally mature enough to bear the responsibility of becoming a parent (sadly a lot of people don't understand this, become parents, and then hurt their children without realising because they're not capable of giving their children the kind of emotional caring they need).

It should not exist between romantic partners. But again, it does, because there are plenty of traumatised people who's emotional maturity got stunted by childhood trauma which means they don't know where to draw the line and love their partners no matter how they get treated by them.

So I assume that her thinking is that it is more helpful to remind you of the progress you've made and your positive sides rather than validate your feelings in that moment. We with BPD/GAD are great at getting into anxiety loops and dwell on our symptoms. I would assume she's trying to help you not get too attached to your suffering (I certainly know I identify with my suffering and symptoms, and part of recovery has been to learn to let go of that).

You should try to bring it up with her. I felt invalidated by my therapist and I brought it up in another session and even though I found it embarrassing to ""criticise"" her it was really helpful and she genuinely apologised. Her intention was not to invalidate my feelings and she promised to keep it in mind in the future and since then we've not had that problem again. Please talk to her about how she makes you feel. She's just human too, and cannot read your mind. A good therapist wants to react in a way that is most helpful to you, and giving her feedback will allow her to do that."
infj,f41twz8,t3_didgp0,1571323786.0,"Thank you for the recommendation! I really like listening to her.

She definitely has a very solid understanding of how an INFJ mind works. She talks very naturally about how she uses her function stack and how the different functions relate to each other. There is no reason to question her judgement of her own personality. She's clearly highly intelligent, and has a good understanding of the Jungian theory underlying MBTI.

Anyone that is attempting to judge her type based on her mannerism has either a very limited understanding of personality theory or is trying to gate-keep the type. Or perhaps both. Dismiss that. You cannot accurately judge someone's type based on any external attributes, and anyone that thinks you can is misusing the theory as gospel."
infj,f4151v0,t3_dj0avh,1571314555.0,"It's usually a gradual realisation for me. Once it was a very sudden realisation, because I had been in serious denial due to circumstance. I love a lot of people, on different levels and have different types of love, but the times I've been *in love* it has been with people I already cared about and feel a mutual attraction with. Eventually I realise I want more of them than I'm getting, I want them around all the time and share everything with them, and learn everything about them.

There is a decision to let myself feel deeper feelings though, I don't fall in love by accident. I can see when it starts to happen and then I either create some distance to stabilise my feelings or let myself act on feeling and see where it goes. Eventually I have to acknowledge that the feelings are strong enough to count as the overwhelming attraction and respect that I see as *being in love*.

It takes me a lot for me to say *I love you,* because to me that means that I'm ready to take on all the future responsibility of someone being in love with me, and them trusting my feelings on that level. To me saying it means commitment to that course of action. I don't say it if I have even the tiniest shred of doubt about my feelings, or commitment to the person either as a partner or as a friend."
infj,f4111lw,t1_f3zna4e,1571312472.0,"I dated an ISTP once, and we had a long and mutually interesting relationship. Yet I know what you mean. He used to be all about the immediate and reasoning, and I was all about possibility and feelings. But we balanced each other out.

His presence forced me to logically justify my thoughts and feelings, and I motivated him to learn about some of our shared theoretical interests, so we could have long interesting arguments about politics and economics. He was incredibly clever, and could have very rigorous deep understanding of things he cared about. He just hadn't met anyone that would nurture that side of him till we met. We've now broken up, but we both learned a huge lot from each other, and we're both better off for having spent those years together.

ISTP primary functions are our tertiary and inferior functions, and vice versa. This would imply that there may not be a lot of middle ground for immature INFJs and ISTPs, but if you treat each other with curiosity and respect, it can be a very fulfilling relationship."
infj,f3xzacs,t1_f3xwh7q,1571246232.0,"I think it's cause our specific kind of deep isn't that common to find, which renders some of misunderstood and a bit bitter. Socially isolated or socially anxious INFJs end up spending a lot of time in a Ni-Ti loop that makes them feel like no one can connect with their type of thinking. It's all down to social skills and how to breach the gap between different kinds of minds. Some are luckier and more capable in this regard than others, but it's a skill everyone can and should learn."
vegan,f3xy6dr,t1_f3xot3n,1571245754.0,"The tendency to favour a tribe is likely genetically predisposed (and ironically also the evolutionary basis for altruistic actions, even found in animals like mice), but higher cognitive functions are specifically the things that enables us to rise above such instinct when reasoning shows us what instincts are just evolutionary baggage. So called speciesism has become evolutionary baggage, and a lot of the mental gymnastics that people use to justify the outdated actions based on it are definitely culturally learned."
vegan,f3xwp24,t1_f3xmgru,1571245113.0,"I think it's more to do with empathetic ability and understanding of the theory of mind. Some people are so poor in these skills they can only extend respect to people who's minds are likely to work very closely to theirs (and this is often judged based on physical and behavioural attributes). They cannot imagine a different kind of a mind. On the other end of that scale is the understanding that even though animals don't have higher cognitive function, they have feelings, and even that type of a mind should be granted basic respect."
infj,f3xuy1z,t3_dira49,1571244238.0,"Try to do more listening than talking. Ask questions.

I've experienced the same confusion as you, but you have to give up the idea that you can connect with them on your level. We all care about the same fundamental things, but we just look at them from different perspectives and explain them to ourselves differently. Don't try to force them to your territory of abstractness, rather try to find out how they view things and how that relates to the way you see things."
BPD,f3xr92q,t3_diqc7y,1571242660.0,"I've got the same. It can ruin my entire day, and even put me in week long cycles of anxiety.

I think your brain tries to process things in your sleep and if you abruptly wake up at the wrong time (someone already suggested the problem is waking up during your REM cycle) then you'll be dropped into negative thought while you're in a sleepy tired state and it makes it harder to work through the racing thoughts and anxiety.

I've not really found out any other solution than trying to make sure nothing wakes me up at night (noises, light, need to pee) before my alarm or before I've had enough of sleep, and making myself feel mentally safe and comfortable before falling asleep. When I'm at my worst this is usually listening to reassuring guided meditation or affirmation asmr videos to fall asleep, but it depends on what I'm anxious about at the time."
musictheory,f3pcrgq,t1_f3o7xsy,1571055043.0,"I meant in the terms of how culturally we prefer quick judgements, and having a degree often may put someone with a degree ahead of someone without.

musictheory,f3lyl2p,t1_f3luvxo,1570980812.0,"That's the case for some people. Other people are more efficient on their own, and that tends to harbour bitterness, because their way of learning puts them at a disadvantage.

Of course it's good to have access to someone more experienced, but that doesn't require the structure of college or professional tuition - just access to a person that knows answers to your questions."
BPD,f3lsjw8,t1_f3iixqg,1570979132.0,"Legitimate love and caring is what we are after, which means it will be our biggest high when we get it. But we're addicted to it, which means that there is also a very ugly flip side to that bliss.

BPD,f3lrr1n,t3_dh3xya,1570978931.0,"Up is down and inside is out and everything is messed up, and yes yes yes the more in love I am the worse the BPD symptoms are.

BPD is basically an attachment disorder. So, as soon as we get attached to someone the symptoms will come out. It's hell, cause it means that we get worst of our symptoms triggered by the people we love and want to trust the most."
BPD,f3fm9lp,t1_f3flgwa,1570899210.0,Sounds like you're not very well versed in internet etiquette. Sounds like there is a generational gap here.

BPD,f3fil90,t1_f3fg4we,1570897672.0,">I literally came here to learn how to help young BPDers more effectively. That's it.

And if that was all you had done, this would've been a mutually rewarding experience. I really was interested in replying to you, but you crossed a line. I get it, it's because you care. But that doesn't matter. Feelings cannot override professional ethics. You need to educate yourself on professional ethics."
BPD,f3fi1kq,t1_f3fc8rh,1570897439.0,"And it would be okay if you only talked about you opinion as an anonymous peer. But you started the thread pronouncing you're a professional.

If you had entered a discussion as a peer, the situation would be different."
BPD,f3fguyi,t1_f3fe2nc,1570896961.0,">obligation to help people with minimal or no access to good care

The fact that you feel the obligation doesn't make it ethical. If you're claiming to be a professional in the context of the discussion, you can collect information, but giving out advice on an anonymous message board is definitely dubious. If you want to give advice it needs to be in the context of you being a peer without BPD, not as a professional psychiatrist.

Now, I don't know what comment you are referring to but my stance stands either way. I assume you mean well, but that doesn't mean you didn't broke professional ethics."
aspergirls,f3d8mva,t1_f3bdlqn,1570833264.0,"I think we can determine much more quickly who we like and who we don't like than neurotypicals do. This may mean that if we feel comfortable, we will be affectionate and open much quicker than others would expect from someone that wants to be friends, so friendly behaviour reads as flirtatious. We also follow our feelings more than convention. This means we might use the kind of body language and behaviour that others only expect only from a potential romantic or sexual partner."
BPD,f3d25f5,t1_f3cj4sn,1570830940.0,"I think taking a liking to DBT is a personality thing (dependent on the ""healthy personality"" outside of the BPD symptoms).

Kind of a introvert/extrovert divide."

BPD,f3bh9ok,t1_f3bb156,1570810237.0,"I didn't consider I had trauma either until I started looking into what trauma really means. Culturally we only see things traumatic if they have the potential to be traumatic for adults. Very mundane things can be traumatic to children, but we consider poor childcare normal and that means we don't consider the effects of it traumatic.

I can't make any claims about your specific case but more often than not BPD comes from some type of trauma. It may have a genetic component which means some will have it get triggered much easier than others."

BPD,f3b6s58,t1_f3b5l3z,1570803127.0,"I can understand why you would have a problem with it, but that is not a problem with my words. You're having an emotional reaction because you feel empathy and want everyone taken care of. That is totally valid, and a beautiful thing. But it also means you have harder time empathising with someone that lacks empathy, because you don't know what that feels like. I know what it is like, which means I know some people with NPD will be the last people saved."

I would love to help them right now cause that would be the quickest way to cut the cycle of abuse but a lot of people with NPD don't even realise they need help.
BPD,f3b5yr1,t1_f3b5swl,1570802523.0,No. I want to help anyone if they ask for help. People with NPD rarely ask for help. I would fucking love one of the people with NPD that I've loved to actually ask for help. They manipulate people to get help. You clearly have very limited understanding of the disorder.
BPD,f3b5slm,t1_f3b5il7,1570802398.0,"You clearly don't know how to love someone with NPD. Unquestioning validation is enabling the disorder. People with NPD need acceptance, but not coddling. People need to speak up against their behaviour."

BPD,f3b0os7,t1_f3ava3h,1570798324.0,"That's because a lot of people with these disorders currently need to be locked up. Not because they're evil, but because they don't have the normal cognitive processes to stop themselves from hurting others. We do need to raise awareness that people who aren't malignant also experience these symptoms, but I don't think we're ready for that yet as a society.

People are only now starting to understand the harm that people with these disorders are causing to others, even if they don't seem malignant on the surface level. It will take some more time to get to the understanding that these people are not ""evil"" despite their evil behaviour, and that human mind is very malleable and that they could be treated."
BPD,f3b05xe,t1_f3asxex,1570797866.0,"BPD and NPD symptoms often go hand in hand. If you also have BPD symptoms, you're at much better position to recover than if you didn't. A mental health professional should work with you despite the stigma against NPD.

The problem is that you can only treat people that want to be treated. A lot of people with NPD are causing much more suffering than they're experiencing, which means there is little motivation to seek treatment.

Resources should primarily go to people that suffer and want to work on getting better. All the people with NPD I have met think they're better off than everyone else, and the suffering they experience is due to not getting validated by the people they are abusing.

Luckily this will only last until the rest of us get healthy, and then the people with NPD don't have anyone to leech off of and the only option left is to understand that their lack of empathy is a disorder, not a superpower."
BPD,f3azce6,t3_dg9h7j,1570797133.0,"Not all mental health awareness is created equal. BPD is a contested diagnosis. 

C-PTSD should take its place (what we're experiencing is different levels of trauma relating to attachment... even if we don't remember the trauma or don't classify our memories as traumatic), and due to that I think it's good that there's not too much BPD information available to the general crowd. 

Even the mental health professionals don't always understand us! Switching the thinking from us having disordered personalities to treating attachment trauma would be much more effective, both for awareness and the treatment of our disorder.

There is no easy way to package these disorders to a wide audience, especially when they're based on trauma. The blame for our suffering rests on *someone*. It doesn't require us to only look at ourselves, but others to look at just how toxic our society is. General mental health awareness is much more effective for now, and the rest we can do by ourselves by seeking treatment the best we can. We are the best people to raise awareness once we have recovered from this ourselves."
