plants,fpdpu6v,t3_gcvwev,1588531812.0,"Sowed seeds in the two new cans to the left. The carrot on the right is about 30 days old now. 37 if you count days to germination. I've begun sort of documenting the process. Considering that pringles cans are only 8"" deep rather than a foot, I'll probably harvest around 60-65 days, and they may not be full sized. I've got a few photos of how I prepped the cans before planting seeds. I punched drain holes, used the lids as a way of catching any drained water (they won't hold much but as long as you watch to make sure water doesn't go everywhere, they're more effective than nothing). And then of course filled the cans with soil, sowed my seeds, and then watered the seeds. I didn't get photos of these bits, but they're self explanatory."
lds,fookgup,t3_g8mm07,1587940757.0,"I think my advice would be to remember to be open and accepting of your husband. I think if you Harbour anger and pain in regards to him leaving, then you're garunteed an unhappy marriage. Consider what means more to you, loving, and caring for the man you love, and raising a family together? Or your husband explicitly participating in, and being a member of the church? Love is about being caring, amd accepting uncondutionally, and in all honesty, it sounds like if you're holding anger because of this, then you're not providing that. Just be there for him. No matter what. And know that everything will be okay as long as you stay true to your heart, whatever that means to you."

Despite 2d animation being a dying art form, I sort of hoped that maybe I could mess with some 2d animation in the class. Anyways.. it was all 3d animation, and in the class I'd skip ahead a bit. Just mess around with some things the teacher didn't show us, because that's how I learn. And every so often I'd work myself into a hole, and need help getting out. But any time I asked for help the teacher would patronize me. He straight up called me an idiot, and he called me stupid, and incompetent. I kind of showed him though, when I had my entire final project done in close to a week, and did better than most of the kids there."
AskReddit,f7u5f9u,t3_dx7hyx,1574011018.0,"Waaaay back in elementary school, I was dealing with the early onset of mental illness, and I was struggling with adhd.

She told me I wasn't going to make it past the 7th grade. 

Funny enough, she was wrong. I've learned how to turn my weaknesses to strengths. I am in 10th grade, and I have mostly A's, maybe an A- here or there, a 3.9 gpa, and I'm graduating a year early from highschool.
