I don’t believe that personal reinforcement when it comes to an ED is beneficial, especially when calling it a “weight loss” diet. AN is something to be addressed as such, not as a strict dietary plan. Please delete your comment."
EatingDisorders,fm2auo6,t3_fsmm1j,1585693821.0,"Unfortunately this type of thing happens way more than it should & you shouldn’t feel like you owe an explanation to your coworkers for anything personal-related, especially when it comes to eating habits. If “going out” to lunch is an option, take it. You can eat your meal at home or even in your car & avoid your coworkers’ comments. If leaving isn’t an option I think you’re handling it well but you can always say something that redirects their comments to time. I usually mention something about talk < time & I need to maximize my productivity at work. It’s tough hearing comments like that often especially in the workplace but kudos to you for handling it as well as you had been."

Thankfully someone was watching me when I took it otherwise I would have done something extremely bad. Yes, I was Microdosing and I didn’t have an extreme trip or anything like that so it wasn’t a matter of doing too much, I think it really just depends on the person and their level of mental illness at the time."
EatingDisorders,fg1hu4a,t3_ewcxip,1580427374.0,"A lot of times it’s easy to push off things like that and not acknowledge them as an eating disorder since it feels like it’s in your control. Once it’s out of your control, many people are still in that mindset until there’s severe health consequences associated with their ED. Purging wasn’t my go to, I would “fast” several times a week but support my reasoning behind it as a “lifestyle choice” and a “healthy decision” because many health/workout forums say that fasting contributes to a faster metabolism. I wish I would’ve addressed my mindset I had regarding my weight in food intake at the time I was in the very beginning of my ED. I had severe malnutrition, slow heart rate & low blood pressure which contributed to me having a seizure, but I didn’t take it seriously since I didn’t look sick or have significant visible issues. I was 5’3” & 135 pounds when I had a seizure, luckily I was forced to get treatment after that but it was not my decision and if I didn’t have a seizure I would be dead today from my severe ED I didn’t even believe was a problem. I’m proud of you for being able to address it on here because the first step to changing a habit or a possible spiral is acknowledging it as a potential problem. I don’t think that professional help is necessary right now if you focus on actively working to promote a better mindset about your relationship with food. Professional help is always a great idea and I would suggest it for anyone that may be struggling in this area at all as well. Everyone is rooting for you, I’m proud of you for taking this step!"
EatingDisorders,fg1g01r,t3_etskn6,1580426423.0,"Thanks for putting this out here, I feel like a lot of eating disorders, anorexia specifically, aren’t taken seriously until there’s a significant physical aspect to your illness. I’ve been struggling with textbook anorexia for the last eight months or so and I’m finally on my road to recovery after losing 90 pounds in 8 months, however it wasn’t truly acknowledged by anyone, including doctors and my family, until I had a seizure. When I had a seizure I was 130 pounds and 5 foot two, well within a healthy rate range for my height. Unfortunately the more important side of it, the health of my organ system, is severely compromised as my heart arrhythmia, extreme malnutrition & vitamin deficiency had no significant visible symptoms to go along with them. Often times it’s the people within a healthy weight range that have more internal damage than many underweight people with anorexia because it was ignored for so long or not taken seriously in people who appeared “healthy”. I’m disappointed that it took a seizure for people to actually look into my rapid weight loss and declining mental health but that’s far too common in health professionals everywhere. Good for you for speaking up about it, I’m so sorry that you feel like they’re not taking you seriously, if you’re over the age of 18 there are many clinics that will allow you to go and talk to people that specialize in every type of eating disorder and understand how mentally draining it is to have one, let alone one that’s not taken seriously by other medical professionals. Everyone is proud of you"
