I have the odds stacked against me and would perform middling to poorly in competitive sports. And even if I were huge, that wouldn't help me in, say, figure skating or crew. Everyone's body is built differently, it's why some athletes simply have a competitive edge. By this logic, only genetically and physically comparable athletes should be pitted against each other, by height, weight, medical history, age, gender, bone density, lung capacity, and more. But that eliminates any of the nuance of sports. It's not fair in the first place else we wouldn't have a contest."

I used to love team sports and was very athletic, and I've never felt so ostracized for my gender identity as when I see that healthy lifestyles and athletic goals are punishable offenses for trans women.
