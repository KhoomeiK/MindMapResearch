Frontend,fp2f8rz,t1_focqgb2,1588260739.0,"Hi.  I have some more questions, if you don't mind.  Let's say I want to be a front end developer for my entire career.  I'm 29 years old now and will probably retire at age 65.  You already told me that sticking with vanilla JS only is probably not an option and that most employers require at least one JS framework.  How often would you say you have to learn a new framework?  Every year?  Every other year?  Not very often?

Also, how many hours a year do you think the average front end developer needs to spend studying outside of work to keep up to date with relevant technologies?

Thanks.  I hope all is well."

quotes,fo5sa7n,t3_g5e1g3,1587534104.0,"I like this quote.  Does it mean that me hating someone automatically means the cycle will continue?   The cause of the perpetuation is that others witness the expression of hatred and become angry.  Also, if I'm hated, I may take my anger out on someone else and thus continue the cycle, right?

If I send somebody to hell, the cycle repeats itself because that person will become angry.  If I am sent to hell, the cycle repeats itself because I become angry at having been condemned.  Is that correct?"
