So he went back to Europe.

but, honestly, I do think somebody knows WHY he left. They just didn't tell you then because they thought it was too inappropriate for a 13 year old and won't tell you now because the lie's been going on for too long. And it's not like he's coming back or keeps in contact so it's inconsequential."
