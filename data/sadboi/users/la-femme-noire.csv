trippinthroughtime,fnynrij,t1_fnxraol,1587369073.0,"You are correct. They’re considered tricksters and can manipulate people. If you use them to fulfill your needs they can take things from you and attach themselves to you. There are different colors and as most things that are red, red is considered to be the worst of them. 

This is from what I read and has no validity past that."

TwoXChromosomes,fnykoj4,t3_g4m248,1587366088.0,"Oh My Goodness I’m so with you on this. My wife and I moved in with a friend after moving across the country and we are staying with her until the pandemic passes. 

Well, she decides the virus is nothing but “this years flu” yet thousands upon thousands of people are dying. Literally families are losing loved ones and we got people like this just in complete denial of the severity. 

I appreciate the temp home, but having people over all the time is a serious issue. I get nervous every time someone comes over and it’s not like one person(which is still a risk) we are talking multiple people.

It drives me crazy. If it’s not serious then tell that to all the families who have had someone die or suffer from it."

AskWomenOver30,fn602pj,t3_fzo2io,1586682184.0,Every time I see a news story about a family losing a loved one and the events of how it happened I fall apart. No matter how I try to get away from these stories they pop up on every website and feed I’m affiliated with. It ends with me feeling depressed and anxious. How can we not feel a deep sadness. When the numbers pour in of people that have died its horrific. I’m not sleeping right now because of it.

Healthy_Recipes,fkf9pkf,t1_fkezbjb,1584129801.0,"For the most part. I start by sautéing shallots and minced garlic in a pan while I heat up two small cans of organic pumpkin in a pot. I then add the shallots and garlic to the pumpkin. I also sauté rosemary in olive oil and strain out the rosemary. It makes a rosemary flavored olive oil and add that to the pumpkin. I mix in better half (Vegan creamer). This makes a creamy sauce but also breaks the pumpkin up a bit. I add Herbs de Provence for spices. That’s pretty much it.

I use it for pasta sauce and homemade pizza."
