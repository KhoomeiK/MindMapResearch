I see what you mean about starved relationships.

We had necessities growing up, they didnt blow that off for drinking or drugs but selfishness comes in many forms so here we go!

My parents give us $20 in christmas cards each year, which I hate. Just keep it. They make a big deal about paying for dinner when they visit. They were shitty about cosigning for a vehicle before I had any credit for YEARS and said it was because of my sister screwing them over (she was in an abusive relationship losing money, and had bought a car after hers being totaled). They refused to help pay for any kind of college because they couldn't AFFORD it. It's our jobs when we are 18 to.take care of ourselves. They FINALLY cosigned for me at 20, and i paid off the car. I barely got a recognition besides a thank you so much cuz we are so tight that we cant afford. Not a 'thanks for being responsible and doing what you said you would.'


In the 90s they had a modular house built on 5acres in a cheap cost of living state. You would have thought they had a mansion built, especially my dad. This is when I was about 10. He loves to gloat about what he has. Some time later they bought a 5th wheel camper when I was in high school. After that a truck that cost $70k, when I was about 24. They traveled a lot when my Dad retired. When I was 28 they bought a new 5th wheel camper that cost $90k. When they sold their house 22yrs after building it, you'd think they were millionaires, and loved bragging about what they sold it for esp my dad. He now gets into politic discussions about the economy, why they could sell their house. Hes become more and more self centered as I've gotten older. My siblings and in laws joke that 'hes a talker' but hes just mostly unaware of other people as long as he gets to feel important. They only made about 100k profit on their house when selling it 🙄

When I was a teenager and developing/body changing, my mom was buying new Victoria's secret bras and bragging about them to me. When I would show that I was sad about my changing body (size 13 and D cup at age 13/14) she would get frustrated and say ""idk go on s diet I guess"", called me fat when she was mad at me, and act annoyed that I pointed out she was making it worse by bragging about her size 2 and cute bras.  Then she was fooling around on my dad when I was 15, and acted more like.my friend than my mom. I mention the bras because those fuckers are expensive. She would get 3-4 new ones a month. Probably 200-300/mo on bras easily. 

My dad went on lavish hunting trips to Canada and Colorado, yet we only went on one vacation to Disney when it was including a reunion of his unit from Vietnam . We didnt take any other family vacations. This bothered my mom as well. My dad was so concerned about proving his worth thru having a nice house and would get angry if we ever saw a perceived nicer house while out driving around. Helping his kids succeed was never on his priorities.

When I was 17, my aunt died for cancer she had for years. My parents cleared out my moms 401k to pay for my aunt's funeral, even tho she had cancer for 7yrs. 'So her husband and kids didnt have to worry about it.'. While saying to me 'we cant afford college for you'. My sisters accepted this and I just never did. I always saw thru it as bullshit. Sure they were not well off, but to pay for a full out funeral? Why not cremate? I guess her dead sister deserves no limits but we did. 

When I was 30, I went thru a bad breakup, and was kicked out (silver lining I was better off) I had my own small business as a solo practitioner. My parents gloated and acted soooo happy that I had my own business and said they bragged to everyone about it. Well, when I was kicked out I needed an apt and couldn't get approved. My reported income on paper was only $12k after all of my tax write offs. My actual income was 40k, and because I was a solo practitioner, everything I used in every day life doubled as a tax write off. I had plenty of money in the bank ans made over $3k a month. My.parents refused to co sign on my apartment because it would put them on the line. They were basically saying they didnt trust me to be able to pay it. That I could just come home instead. So, if it involved them, they didnt support my business, and were willing to watch me dissolve it to move back to bumfuck Midwest. My friend, who was going thru a nasty divorce with no money, offered to co sign for me. Over my own parents. 

Recently around Christmaa I stopped speaking them because my mom bragged about wanting to give $250 to my friend (whom they dont even know) who is a single mom, for christmas, per my dads generosity. Meanwhile I've had the worst 2019, worst year of my life. They shrugged and said ""your fiance should be taking better care of you"". I was furious. Their N ways have always been this way and now they blame him and say HE should be responsible for me? How insulting. We live on the east coast, it is 2020 with insane rent,not the bumfuck midwest. Even worse? She wanted to send ME the $250 to give to my friend, just after we were nailed with a $800 vet bill. 'So here, take this money, no not the 250, that's for your friend. You take the 20 and give her 250'. Its actually funny to say out loud. She kept talking on the phone, I told her I was going to hang up because I didnt want to be on the phone anymore, while she kept talking of course. She called me back 10 mins later saying 'she didnt know I was gonna hang up but 'I guess we wont help your friend then'. They sent me $100 check at christmas. I sent it back and havent spoken to them since.

I am almost positive they see me as bratty and entitled for holding them accountable for never helping their kids financially. My sisters just dont think they deserve it I guess. To me, your kids shouldn't feel like burdens or like they are out high and dry. 

 In 2018 and 19, I tried several times to tell them how their actions affected me and they cut me off, ignored, mom acted like the victim. Dad tried guilting with 'I wish we could help but we cant' I said 'No Dad, you dont want to, you never wanted to. It's a choice."" It took 45 mins to explain to my mom that the way she was raised is irrelevant to the shitty things she did. She kept whining like a child 'I didn't know, I didn't know any better'. And when I said 'now you do' she was just silent. My sister is incredibly angry, resentful and not managing her mental health at all, she will continue to cling on to them for validation when they're the wrong place to do it from.

In writing this, I have not spoken to my family in a month and a half, and don't plan to anytime soon. If I never did again I would be okay with it."

I'm wondering if effecxor would be a good add on for me. How did yours come to that conclusion? My psych says I have bipolar, my LCSW says I have GAD."

It's been a while since I've worked in food and bev and he has helped me learn a flow of the tables, and how to be more efficient. The stuff he shows me is useful, but for every useful tip, there are 3 micromanaging tips. Lol"
bartenders,fftnqd2,t1_fftniee,1580225149.0,"Thanks man, I am def taking the advice of practicing at home with youtube/flashcards/pouring. One of our wine reps asked for my contact info yesterday as well!"
bartenders,ffswrj2,t1_ffswimc,1580195632.0,"I think you may have just saved my sanity. Thank you SO MUCH! I will definitely try all of the above, and report back in a few weeks. I didn't think classes would be great and dont have a great reputation, but that is a helpful response to why. 

Thankyouthankyouthankyou"
bartenders,ffsvzs0,t1_ffsvdjg,1580194700.0,"Thanks! I also want to mention that hes been there less than 6 mos but worked at the last place a few years as a manager. He is the only employee newer than me. Fun right?! I was thinking the same, figure it out so I dont need him. 

Do you recommend a class, or just practice via youtube and shit? We have pretty simple stuff. It's technically a dinner spot but we are a tavern bar. Old fashioneds, negronis, Manhattans, martinis, aperol spritzers are the most common. Do you recommend a class, or just practice via youtube and shit? 

The owner said the exact same thing. The last girl who quit had a garbage attitude and was rude to customers. He said it was hurting business. I'm not a bubblegum chick, I have a firm backbone and am confident. But he said the bar was in desperate need of positive customer service, and I had enough experience where the drinks would get figured out. 

We have 14 tables and 15 barstools. It's not that hard."
raisedbynarcissists,ffsvi0r,t3_euquek,1580194110.0,"This is wonderful advice. I am currently not talking to my parents. I lived in SC for 5 years and they didnt know if I lived in NC or SC. 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

I want to take at least this year for some space. When I do speak with them again it will be in a separate entity fashion, I love your approach!!"
bartenders,ffsv3m9,t1_ffsuw3s,1580193644.0,"Thank you, this is basically the convo that happened without the ultimatum. The owner needs someone for ordering and inventory and he is the guy. (It doesnt seem that fucking hard to learn) I ripped him when he got cocky and said ""you're in charge of ordering not of the people, when it comes to working together we are equals"" I think the rest of the staff is just sick of hearing about it, so I'm on my own. The owner has addressed it which is positive but I dont think hes gonna change.... it really bums me out. He talks to me like I'm a child."
bipolar2,ffst56u,t1_ffr4ers,1580191509.0,"Hi Thomas, I am a newly diagnosed bp2 :/ curious of your findings - why do doctors seem to want to hush hypomania, when really, bringing us out of depression could be more effective?"

raisedbynarcissists,ffaf5nx,t3_ese2us,1579734278.0,"Yes, in fact my n parents make excuses for my n sister who explodes and is hurtful a lot ""she loves tou, she would be devastated if something happened to you'. 

It is what emotionally unintelligent people do. I am in my 30s and I feel it is wonderful that you have this level of awareness that took me til my late 20s to realize. Keep doing what you're doing, and I suggest learning how to detach from the validation you seek from parents and ppl who know them. Keep dreaming big! Possibly find a mentor."
raisedbynarcissists,fenewsr,t1_femus5u,1579283212.0,"When I did that, my mom screamed louder and mocked me in her screamy voice ""I WiLl tAlK tO YoU iN A ReASonABLe tOnE"" and eventually slapped me across the face.

raisedbynarcissists,fco38lq,t3_ei4zuw,1577823236.0,"I could have written this. I spent 45 minutes explaining ti my mother why how she was raised doesnt diminish my feelings. She did not get it at all. And when I finally didnf back off, she just went silent and did a very guilt tripping ""well I'm sorry but I didnt know"" I completely get it. Idk if its narcissistic necessarily because that encompasses a lot of different traits but it is certainly self centered. My therapist recommended the book 'self centered parents"" or something like that.

Recently my parents offered to give my single mom friend $250 for Christmas, while they give their adult children $20 in xmas cards. I promptly shut that down because I've had HORRIBLE struggles this year. The last time I struggled I needed a cosigner on my apt to stay where I lived running my own business. They said no because ""they couldnt put themselves out like that"" I've never screwed them over and have always taken care of myself. 

Regarding my friend, my mom acted offended, said my fiances income should be enough, i told her I dont want to talk anymore and hung up. She called back leaving a vmail in a pouty tone, saying ""fine I guess we wont help your friend"". I got $100 in the mail from them with a xmas card and I sent it right back. 

My parents are great at seeing situations in a balanced way about other people. Never self reflect or apologize. Just excuses. I have decided to cut them out for now. You deserve better. 

It is COMPLETELY okay to shut down convos when they act that way. For me that was hard but once I did it on the phone I felt so much better. You deserve to stand up for yourself."
raisedbynarcissists,fc2uj4g,t1_fc20v0b,1577374421.0,"Check out the grey rock method. I found this on Quora not long ago, and decided to save it. Give it a read. Chances are, your guilt is keeping NC from working. You know how she is yet still hoped for a decent reaction. Totally understandable and reasonable. Just be honest about where you truly are with this and it will work the way its supposed to! 

WARNING: Some tough love is coming. If anyone can’t handle it, just stop reading.

If Grey Rock isn’t working its because you’re not understanding how its supposed to work, or its because you’re not using it right.

First of all, you only use Grey Rock when you cannot terminate all communication. The only time you are required to communicate with someone is when the law requires it. Therefore, the following reasons are bogus reasons for using Gray Rock in place of terminating all communication:

I like the person too much and want to be friends; wrong, terminate communication.

If I terminate contact with the person other people will unfriend me; wrong, terminate communication and if your friends abandon or harass you they weren’t your friends to begin with.

If I terminate contact with the person my family will disown me; wrong, terminate communication and if your family tries to manipulate or blame you they are abusing their role as family members and deserve a termination of communication as well.

If I terminate contact I will feel guilty; wrong, terminate communication and get mental health counseling so you can develop enough self-love and self-esteem to establish strong enough boundaries that your feelings will not prohibit these kinds of necessary steps.

I share a common child with the abuser but the courts aren’t involved; wrong, get the courts involved, institute child custody proceedings and obtain a series of custodial orders that will allow you to enforce Gray Rock.

When using Gray Rock, you respond to all communications as tersely, and factually as possible. Your tone is dispassionate and ambivalent. If your abuser reacts in a way that you don’t like, ignore it. If your abuser reacts in a way that means they don’t “get it”, ignore it. If your abuser reacts in a way that upsets or irritates you; ignore it. If, in any of these communications the abuser is or takes action that leads to a violation of the courts orders, seek to curtail the abuser’s parental rights or have the abuser imprisoned under the law (for contempt of court). If the abuser doesn’t stop, seek to terminate the abuser’s parental rights. In all of these cases, your communication with the abuser is Gray Rock, but your communication with the attorneys and judges are well articulated, level-headed, and concise. Ultimately, the realization that you need not change the abuser’s mind, only the Court’s, will take hold.

The following reasons are bogus reasons for avoiding the Court system:

I can’t afford an attorney; wrong, represent yourself.

I can’t afford the filing fee; wrong, obtain a fee waiver and proceed in forma pauperis.

I tried but the judge messed up; wrong, file an appeal.

I can’t afford an attorney for an appeal; wrong, represent yourself.

I can’t afford the costs to file an appeal; wrong, obtain a fee waiver and proceed in forma pauperis.

I tried but I can’t file an appeal; wrong, file a petition for extraordinary writ.

I don’t know how to use the system; wrong, learn it, use the self-help centers.

I’m scared; get mental health counseling so you can develop enough self-love and self-esteem to establish strong enough resolve that your feelings will not prohibit these kinds of necessary steps.

You deserve happiness in life. Its your life, stand up and live it. Don’t crawl around in the shadows. Demand respect. Fight for yourself.

I also have had great trouble with work, I tried switching careers from massage therapy (I moved from manageable private practice to spa employee, they overwork and under pay leading to injury) and I just gave up. I racked it up and am filing bankruptcy. I have no assets. 

I was diagnosed as bipolar 2 earlier this year. I now waitress and build clients in massage. Waitressing feels natural to me, and theres nothing wrong with doing it."

I think we all tend to talk ourselves out of something with fear of one thing going wrong, but the truth is that part IS in our minds only and it hasn't happened in real life! It's not real! 

This is a beautiful product."
