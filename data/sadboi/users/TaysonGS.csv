schizophrenia,fr4r342,t3_gmds0z,1589895160.0,"Yeah I feel the same way. My first episode of psychosis I had a very strong delusion that 2 people I worked with were persecuting me. That's all I told one of the hospital staff when I was admitted and within ear shot he was telling the other staff I was having delusions of killing myself and other people. Not even remotely true. He almost had me sent to a higher security hospital but luckily the other staff got to know me a little more and disagreed with him. That was December of 2018 and I haven't been hospitalized since. Since becoming schizophrenic I've grown to really dislike other people because like you said people think their experts on the illness but know absolutely nothing about it. They think it's purely aggression and unpredictability but that's not true. It's psychological anguish and suffering, combined with a loss of self and so much more. Anyhow, people suck. I keep my family in my life and roommates and that's it. Everybody else who judges me and cut me out can get fucked as far as I care lol."

schizophrenia,fqfkqxk,t3_gilfmz,1589326659.0,"Sorry you're struggling buddy. Is there anything you enjoy doing that keeps your mind occupied? Having schizophrenia makes it extremely hard to focus on anything besides what's going on in your head so I completely understand how hard it is to get out of that soul sucking negative spiral but the best way to do that is to focus energy on hobbies. Or a goal you've always wanted to hit, like learn an instrument for example. Also, are you on medication? You might need to have it adjusted or changed if you are. Once I found the right combination for my brain it was a night and day difference. So don't give up and keep trying your best until you find what works for you because it's out there and you can find it 😊"

Nootropics,fpdy6mm,t3_gcqntj,1588536597.0,Unless you're okay with being dependant on nicotine id highly recommend quitting while you can. The euphoria will go away and you'll end up increasing your nicotine intake to compensate. My tolerance to nicotine got drastically higher after about 3 months. I started with smoking a cigarette after every meal then slowly needed more and more nicotine. When my tolerance to it built up I ended up at 12 or so cigarettes a day.  I've been addicted to it for almost 6 years and trying to quit has been a nightmare every single time. I thought the same thing at first as you; that I'll just keep my intake low. Nicotine doesn't really work that way and once you're addicted to it it's HIGHLY addicting.

schizophrenia,fp2uraa,t3_gahytp,1588268225.0,"The theory in psychology is that psychosis is caused by high levels of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter in the brain that has many functions but one is motivation. Antipsychotics hijack some dopamine transmitters in the brain. (The higher the dosage, the more dopamine that gets blocked) Bipolar mania is theorized to be a result of too much dopamine and it's believed that that is why antipsychotics help treat it. If you've never heard of meth psychosis  (induced by smoking too much meth) then it's very similar to schizophrenia. Meth raises dopamine levels in the brain and since it's effects are similar to schizophrenia, scientists theorize that schizophrenia is caused by extremely high levels of dopamine and that's why antipsychotics treat it."

Stop being nice to people with the expectation of something in return. There's people who appreciate kindness and then there's people who take advantage of kindness and will use you until you no longer serve their purpose then leave you in the dust with no regard of your feelings. You can't let yourself be hurt over selfish people. Making excuses for people by saying others are ""victim blaming"" is stupid because it doesn't help people who victimize themselves. It just validates that a victim mentality is acceptable when it isn't. If you find somebody repeatedly being a victim in the same situation then you give advice and help them learn what they're doing wrong so it doesn't happen again and their life then gets better and they get the outcome they're looking for. Saying ""poor you you're a victim"" doesn't help them in any way and they'll be doomed to keep repeating the same mistake. It's not toxic to give helpful advice."

schizophrenia,fo3nyn4,t3_g5bdjh,1587490076.0,I was stable and still had my job for 15 months so I felt like maybe I was put on meds due to circumstance and not actual illness  (I had a really toxic relationship that triggered my schizophrenia) but turns out I become ill again if I go lower than 150mg of seroquel. So I've accepted I need to stay on it. I hate the weight I've gained and not really feeling emotions or desiring social interaction but other than that my experience with seroquel has been pretty good. It gets rid of positive symptoms for me but makes negative symptoms a lot stronger.

Also not to sound insensitive or rude but it kind of sounds like you have difficulties accepting your actions and growing from mistakes which isn't bad, I've certainly been there too.

They completely dropped the ball on trials and it's disgusting that they based an entire season on old content that was taken away. And couldn't even have been done at least decent. Not to mention the only PvE content added was mindless bounty grinding, and I feel like this season is the laziest and worst ""new"" content bungie has come up with. The current seasonal model they have is killing the game. They aren't making any progress whatsoever. Just recycling old content and activities. It's really soured me on D2 and until the game feels meaningful again I'm not giving bungie another dime."

Then I start to get stressed out that I'm not hitting my goals, and we all know how stress affects psychotic illnesses. Once I get stressed I start to get delusional and very very paranoid.

I'm on 150mg of seroquel and I'd say it's stopped about 70% of my psychotic symptoms. Been on it about 16 months and have found it's the lowest dose I can be on that works well enough.

That's invaluable knowledge to have with all the crazy people out there in the dating game. It hurts right now but time will heal it.

Some people think all schizophrenics are the type that wear foil hats and argue with the microwave and can't grasp the fact that it's on a spectrum. It's like saying everybody without a mental illness is the exact same person. Everybody has different levels of morality and a different personality, and varying views of reality. I don't even try to educate people that don't get it because if they refuse to open their mind a bit then they can live in blissful ignorance if they want to."

I started having behavioral problems that went on for about a year then smoked weed for the first time and it permanently changed me. While I was high I was flipping out thinking I need to go to the hospital because I thought I was dying. Then after my first weed experience everything went downhill for me as well. That was in 2012. I withdrew from life for 2 years and was in my room almost all the time playing videogames as a coping mechanism to keep my mind busy. This was from 2012 to 2014. Then I got my first job and I did really good for 4 years. I was socially involved and happy about life again. In June of 2018 I moved out of my parents home and into a house with roommates. In July of 2018 I met a girl that I hit it off with really well and she ended up breaking my heart. Things were going very well and she all the sudden decided to ghost me and got back together with her on again off again ex. She left me with zero answers or explanation and wouldn't talk about it. I was left to just try to figure out what happened. I went into a deep depression for a few months and started hearing that she was telling people I worked with that I was a psychopath. Not cool, especially because after she ghosted me I gave her the same treatment. I didn't text her, meet up with her, nothing. I left her alone. People at work started talking about me behind my back and people started acting very uncomfortable and weird around me. Of course being in the prodrome of schizophrenia I thought about it nonstop and started getting very paranoid that everybody was out to get me. Then after a few weeks of dealing with that stress I had my first psychotic break. All I remember about it was that my mind was flying too fast for me to process it and I was trying to solve a million questions I had in my mind all at once. I was put on Seroquel and Gabapentin and still have my low days but I at least have control over my mind again and am stable for the most part. Only thing that's changed for me is I keep people at a distance and don't fully trust anybody anymore. I still have my job, work full time, still have the same roommates (they are great dudes for accepting that I'm a little bit different) and recently got a car I've wanted for a long time. I'm proud of myself for despite dealing with all of that craziness I was able to pull myself back together and not fully self destruct. I hope you have the same luck and are able to make a full recovery."

How I got over it was by accepting the fact that there is horrible people out there and her shitty personality will come back to hit her extremely hard later on in her life. Same goes for the women that hurt you. But don't let your illness define your life story.

schizophrenia,fkvw609,t3_fkzhbc,1584578003.0,I know how it feels to have close family not want to know anything about your illness. It's quite frustrating and leaves you feeling invalidated but your experiences are valid even though nobody wants to acknowledge it. One thing I had to learn is that we (schizophrenics) are only 1 percent of the population. We experience things that healthy individuals do not. It's not that they don't care about you it's most likely that they just don't get it and don't want to say the wrong thing so they'd rather just not say anything. Normal people don't have the imagination and mind that we do. Their minds are quite different so I just think they can't wrap their head around something like schizophrenia. Not trying to sound like I'm calling them dumb but rather I'm just saying they are wired much differently than us. If you need a good place to vent therapy could help you immensely. It's a great way to get your emotions out. Even though schizophrenia is really hard sometimes it does have it's advantages. Best of luck to you 😊

schizophrenia,fkoyfdj,t3_fjspvl,1584397762.0,"Not a dumb question at all. I'd say yes, being wrapped up inside of a delusion is definitely an episode in my mind.

Mine usually consist of delusions of being persecuted or hurt by somebody and it has me extremely paranoid. Still an episode even though I'm not hallucinating because in reality I'm just chilling in my room and people are probably just out living their lives and not out to get me.

schizophrenia,fkoqp2d,t3_fjq6fs,1584393006.0,Destiny 2 is a great one. There's so many quests and weapons to collect that it kept my mind occupied for quite a while.
schizophrenia,fko4le7,t1_fkir7o2,1584379997.0,Glad I'm not the only one 😁
schizophrenia,fknk9de,t1_fkm33wc,1584367803.0,"I'm very comfortable being in solitude. I wanna jump out of my skin when I'm in social environments. I don't dislike or have anything against other people, they just make me extremely uncomfortable."
schizophrenia,fkib4c1,t3_fik7kr,1584215853.0,I've been on seroquel for 15 months and was 117 pounds before starting it. I'm now 174 pounds. Not sure if it's the medication that's made me gain weight or the fact that I ate maybe 700 calories a day before taking it and now I actually eat but yeah. Antipsychotics are notorious for causing weight gain.
schizophrenia,fkiail8,t1_fki167b,1584215451.0,I'm in the same boat. People make me extremely uncomfortable so I just do my own thing alone.
schizophrenia,fkfz3kg,t3_fi12xb,1584145965.0,I never have experienced that type of psychotic episode but I've heard a few stories from fellow schizophrenics describing similar experiences. Are you on an anti-psychotic? They should eliminate that issue.
schizophrenia,fk8gcmk,t3_fh1tju,1583955520.0,I hear ya buddy. I'm extremely apathetic as well. I don't care about anybody or anything and just go through the motions every single day hoping this damn illness will just randomly go away. I'm either flat or depressed or anxious. It feels pointless to me too to keep on living when all I can count on is this illness getting worse the more time passes. I wish we could all be cured and enjoy a fulfilling life like everybody without this illness does. It's depressing.
DestinyTheGame,fk5vxt8,t3_fgl0or,1583888891.0,At the end of the day they make Destiny 2 content with the idea of making as much $$$ as possible. That's why eververse exists and why they switched to a seasonal approach. The world doesn't revolve around us (the consumer) these developers have bills to pay just like we do. I don't think any of us go to work every day with the expectation of giving our customers the best product possible even if it comes out of our wallets so how can we expect bungie to do the same?
Mustang,fjbggad,t1_fjbda1j,1583192726.0,Thank you!
datingoverthirty,fj48z5g,t3_fb9301,1583002959.0,Geez. Breaking up with a crazy person is never easy but good on you for standing your ground and getting out. You deserve better.
Monitors,fiyake4,t1_fixrp95,1582835733.0,I bought the 27gl850 and I'm loving it too. The color on this monitor is crazy good. Hard to believe it's only SDR.
Nootropics,fix5n2d,t1_fiwnswl,1582813238.0,"I guess I should've clarified better. I wasn't saying it does happen, I meant that it does suck. I have no information besides personal experience. Couldn't even find anything about it on Google."
Nootropics,fivpncp,t1_fivoo5e,1582765279.0,It does
destiny2,fir0by1,t1_fiqscga,1582654829.0,Only 600 I have 826h just on steam
bipolar,fi7iwng,t3_f6kfmq,1582222253.0,Nothing silly about being proud of accomplishments. Congrats on the tremendous progress you've made in your life
destiny2,fi72jmt,t1_fhyiexk,1582212938.0,The problem with that though is if you have 9 activities a week that give pinnacles everybody hits max power in around 6 weeks. And in turn people get bored and bungie loses players on their game.
destiny2,fhxy0j9,t1_fhxxcto,1581964645.0,If they were still at 750 power it definitely would break the system.
destiny2,fhxx6a4,t1_fhxwoo7,1581964174.0,That's fair but if every season is just gonna have a few story missions and a repetitive activity there needs to be something that keeps us high power level guardians interested and on the game. Obviously I would also hope they'd make the old raids pinnacle or master level.
destiny2,fhmgjdd,t3_f3r595,1581712461.0,They never will. That's why they charge money for ornaments and they're a business so they have to make money or no more Destiny.
bipolar,fhkv3dd,t3_f3j6kv,1581691760.0,That looks delicious. You should sell those. Bet you'd get quite a bit of business
bipolar,fg7j78z,t3_exarxe,1580593821.0,I hate being manic as well. I've only experienced mania one time and thought it was a good idea to go around telling people I had a spiritual awakening and that I was about to kill myself until it saved me. People of course asked me if I was okay and told me I looked crazy and had a wild look in my eyes. I then became intensely paranoid and yeah the rest is history haha. I'll take depression over mania any day. I'm the same with depression in the sense that I'm easy to be around but beat myself into the ground. It sucks but at least I don't feel absolutely crazy.
bipolar,fg0i4gl,t3_ew4c3k,1580408267.0,I can totally relate. I've only dated one time and got heartbroken and couldn't cope with the stress. It was actually what triggered my bipolar so since that experience was so bad I've stayed single and I find it much more enjoyable. If you can handle the emotional rollercoaster of dating when you have bipolar disorder props to you and I wish you the best 😁 I think it's normal for people with this illness to stress over intimate relationships.
datingoverthirty,ffwpouh,t3_ev9hk7,1580307961.0,"How is it dangerous if you are happy? If you're happy there is nothing wrong with it at all. I think the strongest people are people that don't need to be surrounded by others to be happy. If somebody tries to tell you how you live is unhealthy but you're completely happy and at peace, odds are they are insecure and jealous of you. That's my two cents, I've learned that there is a lot of selfish people out there who pretend to care about other people just to gain something from them. So why bother with other people in my opinion."
destiny2,ffvag4u,t1_ffuoc0r,1580259508.0,How come it can't be compared to shotguns? It's just as deadly at close range and has more range. It costs a grenade but if you use contraverse hold and stack discipline mods (like most people in comp do) you can get it back in no time.
destiny2,ffukti2,t3_ev7i4i,1580244065.0,I hate playing against handheld supernova because it's essentially a more powerful shotgun. It's broken in my mind when an ability one class has is the best close quarter option in the game because it's only available to one class. If you aren't a Warlock good luck countering it close quarters. Everybody I play in comp that uses it always gets most of their kills from it and goes positive with a kdr of 2+. That's very broken. At least with OEM you actually have to have gun skill to be effective.
DestinyTheGame,ffqnvfz,t3_eugpc8,1580139495.0,It's turning some people off but I love the state of the game. There's hours upon hours of content and it's a completionists wet dream.
