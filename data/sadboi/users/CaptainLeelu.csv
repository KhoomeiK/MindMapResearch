a) he lied and said you were the only woman he was talking to and you when but you really weren’t

b) because he was also talking to other women before you guys decided to be official.

The lie i understand, it’s silly and he shouldn’t have done that. But, judging from your reaction, he clearly did that because he knew you were gonna make a big deal over it, something he did before making the relationship leap with you. 

You guys weren’t even official, it’s called dating for a reason. Important thing is that he stopped talking to them when you guys decided to be serious. Give the dude some credit, he clearly knows he was wrong about the lie, but you’re in the wrong as well for being mad at him for talking to others BEFORE you guys made it official. Don’t stress yourself out, you’re only hurting your relationship at this point.

He asks you to trust him, he corrected his mistake and he showed you he can make things right. Give him that chance and relax and enjoy your relationship."

Also, the exfoliating mitts work great. I use the Korean exfoliating washcloth, but you have to be gentle when using it since it can be abrasive to sensitive areas.
