They spent the whole summer together swimming and biking and hanging out and barely say anything to each other. Physically, they were in contact with each other but where‚Äôs the love? If you‚Äôre going to argue that the dialogue doesn‚Äôt matter because of how good the acting is, do you not agree that actors can still do a wonderful job with whatever they‚Äôre given? Even if what their given is poorly written? The dialogue was all over the place, minimal, and conflicting. 

I don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre saying that the point is that it ‚Äúcan‚Äôt work‚Äù. Why?? If they loved each other it really could work. Oliver just chose to leave. Plus they didn‚Äôt get together at just the end of the summer, they ‚Äúgot together‚Äù a few times during. But it‚Äôs not like sex is the epitome of all things to love about a person and THATS when you realize you need to be together. 

In the book, the whole point is Elios infatuation with Oliver. It makes sense in the book because in great detail Elio recalls everything and picks over every tiny action and what it means. He‚Äôs reminiscing and trying to put things together. Theres no context in the movie it just shows external events and poorly pieces them together."
