PhilosophyofScience,fnworhn,t1_fnwm3m6,1587322470.0,"I’m not confused about anything, I have a degree in philosophy and a decent sense of how the field works. I’m going to say definitively not substantively that if you don’t read the source material you don’t understand the ideas that are put forward in the source material. If you don’t believe my argument that philosophy works differently from the sciences, you should at least believe that what I say is based on observation and experience of formal philosophy education through which I have found what works and what doesn’t work. The people who understand the material the best are the ones who spend most time with the source material. Part of understanding the idea properly in philosophy is understanding the way that the idea is put forward.

A big part of philosophy is not taking claims or representation of an idea at face value. In order to satisfy this rigor you need to get as close to the argument as you can, which you can only do by reading the source. It’s not about style or rhetoric or biographical interest, it’s about the fact that the best way to address a claim and the arguments in its support is to hit the claim directly which you necessarily cannot do by responding to a summary of an argument. There is a difference between “Popper says...” and what Popper says, no matter how effectively you think the idea from the latter is demonstrated in the former. Understanding math requires knowing definitions, theorems, proofs thereof, solutions to problems and the like. For physics we need first principles, experimental results, derivations of formulas etc. These things can be 100% faithfully reproduced in secondary sources. Philosophical arguments simply cannot.

Understanding philosophy requires knowing claims and the arguments for those claims when definitions may vary, there are no or few guaranteed results and there are open problems for thousands of years that will probably never be closed. Two philosophers can use the same word in completely different ways; see the debate on Thomas Kuhns notion of incommensurability. You can get an overview of the way this word might be used differently in different positions, but you won’t be able to decide for yourself what you believe based on the overview. You will reach a better understanding of those claims and arguments if you read them as they are stated before interpretation or representation.

I would imagine that many universities have online courses. A course from pretty much any credible university will do just fine."
PhilosophyofScience,fnwjp6y,t1_fnwcm0f,1587319676.0,"If you don’t want to understand the works of Thomas Kuhn (substitute Popper, Lakatos, Stillos, Lewis, Cartwright or whomever you like) you don’t want to understand a major movement and idea in the philosophy of science full stop.

I don’t really have time or energy to respond to the things I think you misunderstand about the practice of philosophy (not to mention literature but that is beside the point). I would recommend a course in the subject, in which you will most definitely be given source materials as reading assignments for myriad good reasons, if you would like to get a really deep, useful and accurate understanding of topics in the philosophy of science."
PhilosophyofScience,fnvynx6,t1_fnv3ru6,1587307783.0,"Sure, but Darwin and Newton didn’t write philosophy. They are different fields and I don’t know why you would expect them to be approached in exactly the same way. It is not true that compiled textbooks are the best way to learn in every academic discipline. If you want to study Shakespeare you don’t read the cliff notes on Shakespeare. If you want to study Thucydides you don’t read a summary of Thucydides. Literature and history are not math or science... Philosophy is not math or science either.

You don’t read a philosophical argument directly from its author to get “context,” you read it to most faithfully represent the argument. The premises may or may not not be sound, or whether they are sound may be up for debate, or it may be unclear whether the argument is valid, and it shouldn’t be up to a “professional educator” to give the end-all be-all verdict on this.

The best way to study philosophy, to be a part of a philosophical discussion on a subject, is to read and discuss philosophy, not textbooks. Textbooks will take you part of the way to understanding Karl Popper but it’s pretty widely agreed that you don’t understand it unless you’ve read at least some of it. That’s the answer to OP’s question.

It is possible to amend a single argument in different ways to make it more or less “useful”. Take for example right and left Hegelian — one would not be able to see that an argument from Hegel would be “useful” from the other’s reading and reconstruction of Hegel. So they read Hegel for themselves and found their own version of what was “useful” about it. That is one of the many cool things about philosophy. While there are truths, falsehoods and logic at the bottom, there are many ways that an argument can be “useful” with those basic ingredients, and often the ingredients are not definitions or observations that can be copies down and repeated into posterity."
PhilosophyofScience,fnv0cle,t1_fnunjew,1587276195.0,"Not really. In philosophy “refining” and “repackaging” entails a lot more misrepresentation of claims and arguments. 

“In a general sense, the originator of an idea is rarer the person best suited to teach that idea” - you got an argument for this? 

It doesn’t seem like you have a good understanding of what teaching an idea looks like in philosophy. The person who best understands what is meant in a philosophical argument will be the person who came up with that argument and believes what that argument supports. It is much easier to misrepresent someone else’s thought than your own. This is particularly true in the philosophy of science, and has led to very widespread misreading of Thomas Kuhn’s work. There is much in the history and current practice of philosophy that is arguing over what, say, Wittgenstein was really getting at in his works. How can you have a meaningful opinion on the best way to understand what he wrote if you don’t know what he himself wrote? 

A textbook may be useful for giving a general sense of a philosophical notion but you can’t hope to understand it properly unless you go to the source."

askphilosophy,fhdk3nu,t3_f2hzju,1581488981.0,"Damn Finally a question I can answer on here!! Short answer no, long answer basically probably. Im exhausted and typing on my phone so beaR with me if this is not super cogent.

First I’ll encourage you to disregard those comments that say something along the lines of “it’s all subjective,” “it’s all based in feelings” “anyone can say something is art.” Sure, that Last one may be at least true, but the fact remains that there are artistic experiences that touch many people, and there’s a guy I saw on r/drugs who rips acid and shits in public urinals and thinks that is art. The question then becomes, why does it matter what some critics/professors/reviewers/other artists/my friends/the people I respect/don’t respect think about it, and not this lunatic from r/drugs? Am I, not to mention almost any art loving person, wrong for not finding this shit in a urinal a beautiful artistic piece?

And on the issue of ones judgment of a piece of art just being your “opinion,” or “totally subjective” consider that there are many physical facts that will help determine if we consider a piece of art good. For example facts of lived experience: I grew up in a poor neighborhood so I like rap music about people from poor neighborhoods. Then there are very scientifically rooted qualities like tone, timbre, rhythm, the use of color and lighting, the qualities and histories of materials used in art.

Perhaps There are no predicates like “is red” or “10kg mass” for art; of course a painting may be red or have 10kg mass but we do not evaluate it artistically on this basis. So the “objective” properties of art are not much use on their own as criteria for determining good or bad art. But there can be shared Artistic values to be agreed or disagreed upon. Like the way we have moral values. I don’t think that moral values are so obviously “subjective” just because people include their opinions and experiences in forming them. Nor would I say this for aesthetic values.

Here are some people’s’ stabs at trying to determine what makes good art good and bad art bad. A lot of the issue here is you have to get real clear on what art is, what makes it art at all, why people like and do not like art, why if at all art is important in human life, things like this. So without a solid answer on that stuff you can’t really hit your question.

Classical Greek tradition aligns good art with a healthy culture, sound morals etc.  In the Poetics, Aristotle lays out some criteria for a good work of art (for him this means epic poetry and drama)- that it should have good logos, ethos and pathos, that it should have some cathartic benefit to the viewer, and so on. We all know Platos supposed hatred of the arts, as they provide a third rung down from his perfect world of the Forms (don’t want to get into this rn Lol). So we have the classical attempt at setting criteria for evaluating art in the way you suppose. There are more attempts later. 

Sidebar in Confucian aesthetics there is a principle of insipidity, of the sort of closeness in resemblance and experience of art works to the material world, in line with his sort of non-metaphysical project. So that’s another shot at a criteria, but one that, like P and A, also requires swallowing several pretty cumbersome  philosophical positions to accept.

Fast forward to Hume and Kant whose theses are described about 6/10 correctly in another comment on here (informed expert “true judges” for Hume, the antinomy of taste and the mechanics of art forming in the intentional mind for Kant) and Hegel who ties up arts value with all of his Geist shit and mans pleasure in seeing himself actualized in the world outside him a sense... ok can’t get into that here either. And Heidegger with his nice theory of “world worlding” but I shouldn’t run my mouth on that, I don’t understand it super wel.

Ill Point out that Kant actually did most of his work on natural beauty and, while it is useful for considering art, he did not have a very good sense for what made good art. He hated music because it made noise (somewhere in critique of pure judgment). This brings an important point: we should be more inclined trust the aesthetic judgments of people with more exposure to the arts. While Kant can lay out a good framework, I like Humes idea that some people can provide more complete understanding of why some art might be good or bad. Though the way Hume identifies these people is, predictably, bogus and the idea of consensus aesthetic judgments can be circular.

I most prefer the answers to this question suggested by more recent literature. It is generally understood that there is an “artworld” - which we can locate in some combination of consumers, academia, artists, relevant history and social context, prevailing intellectual trends, etc.  - and this is a place where judgments about art take place, where there are agents disagreeing on their aesthetic qualities. Kendall Walton in “Categories of Art” says that there are “category information” that make an artwork good or bad with respect to the artworld that it lives in. Why did people think Manet was trash when he first started painting and now Olympia is considered one of the most beautiful works in western tradition? Walton says it is because the close minded critics of the early 20ty century (and later those close minded critics who dismissed Andy Warhol, the Dadaists, feminist performance art etc.) were not in the know of some important objective information that would have been needed to better justify the claim that Manet made a nice painting. He spells this out pretty elaborately in the paper. I’m tired but I can probablt share more later. Peace !!"
