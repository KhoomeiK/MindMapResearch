At the very least an Emergency Protective Order. Not that a piece of paper would stop him but that would establish a paper trail of the abuse and could be helpful in prosecuting him. She needs therapy as soon as possible. It’s very important that she works through the issues that he has caused and the experience she’s been through. As far as the car, if your mom told you to switch it out, will it be registered to your mother as well?  If so, your mom can make it clear that if she returns to him, the car does not. Being in the same city as you makes a lot of sense as far as her having support. You’re doing a great job!"
domesticviolence,fpczqnk,t3_gcpc60,1588516685.0,"1. Trade her car in ASAP... Find something plain, that does not stand out. For extra protection, window tint will help to keep others from seeing inside or being able to identify who’s car it is immediately. Another suggestion is to purchase something very different than what she would normally buy. (She normally drives sports cars, buy a family or economy car) 
2. Change all PlayStation usernames, emails and any other online tags. Absolutely no contact is best. 
3. Change her phone number and to even take it a step further, change any and all phone numbers he might know. If he can’t get to her, he might try to contact her through other people or family members. 
4. “Hometown” is no longer her safe haven. She needs to break all contact with the town for at least a year and make her a life elsewhere. A few hours drive should be fine as long as there’s no way he can track her back down. All contact with family should be done through new numbers or have her use your phone.

She needs to be as far away as she can get for as long as possible.  Also, advice for you... sometimes after the trauma and the initial shock has worn off, people will sometimes forgive their abusers and go back. Be her support even after it seems she’s ok, let her vent, yell or whatever she needs to do to process the loss. She’s processing a lot right now. In addition to being physically hurt, she’s emotionally hurt and also grieving the loss of a relationship and future she had planned. My sister has been in an abusive relationship for years and she always goes back. I’m happy that your sister was able to escape. Sending you both good vibes!!"

2020 Census Guidelines Protecting yourself from COVID-19
You can protect yourself from respiratory illness by following the guidelines below and practicing healthy hygiene habits.
 Do not attempt to make contact at structures. All cases are to be conducted by observation. Look for indications of additional living quarters.
 Should you be asked by a respondent about the reason for your visit, provide a Confidentiality Notice, show your badge, and reply to the respondent with the following, “I am with the United States Census Bureau. I am updating the Census Bureau’s address list and maps and delivering a 2020 Census questionnaire package to some housing units.”
 Should you encounter a respondent, allow a distance of six-feet between you and the respondent.
 Avoid direct contact with respondents. Avoid shaking hands with respondents and use other noncontact methods of greeting.
 Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
 Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or the inside of your elbow.
 Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available.
 When possible avoid contact with high-touch surfaces in public places – elevator buttons, door handles, doorknobs, tables, and handrails.
 Wash or sanitize your hands after touching surfaces in public places.

We were told by our supervisor to avoid contact if possible and use hand sanitizer often."
Census,fklh41n,t1_fkki0vq,1584306175.0,"You have to leave a questionnaire packet at each actual residence. We’re not allowed to leave them near mailboxes or in common areas. Must be obviously for that home. 

If it only has one entrance, you’ll only do one map spot. The purpose of the map spot is just so someone else can find it later."
Census,fkk8t3x,t3_fik75c,1584277395.0,"We do still have to go door to door but with this Covid 19, we are not to attempt to make contact. We are supposed to just collect map spots and confirm address by observation. If someone approaches us, we’ve been directed to maintain a 6 foot distance and be polite and answer questions. We also will be leaving the questionnaire but we won’t be actively pursuing making contact with anyone."

Your son will see this as you making him a priority and that your weekends together are important to you as well. You did good here. I would still make it a point to explain to your stepdaughter privately the importance of those activities with your son. Continue to take time with your stepdaughter and encourage your wife to do the same.

AmItheAsshole,fhskvff,t3_f4k9ld,1581862218.0,"NTA, I would do the same for my niece. As a parent, I do sort of see that maybe she doesn’t want her daughter to make the same mistakes she did, but the mistake (unprotected sex) has been done and there’s nothing she can do about it now. But she really needs to see past her hypocrisy to be there for her daughter. A 15 year old is in no shape to have a child and things will not be easy for her, even beyond the years after she becomes an adult. Imagine being 19 with a 4 year old and trying to go to college or working around the clock to provide for a kid that she will probably resent because she was Forced to become a mother. OP, you are absolutely Not an Asshole for standing up for your niece. Don’t waver in your support because it sounds like you’re all she has. Good Luck and Good Vibes!!"

Although they were cavity free and healthy, I had some crazy gaps and turned teeth. Everyone told me as long as I didn’t have pain and could eat that I shouldn’t worry. I did what I felt was necessary for me and you would not believe how my confidence soared. In that, I became a happier wife, mother.

casualiama,fd9rya3,t3_ek7wxt,1578237269.0,"I’m from Kentucky (actually pretty close to you!) and people from this area have a hard time when they see someone doing better than them. I’ve been told more times than I count to not “live above my raising”. I think the intent is to keep one grounded but it really is success shaming. My sister to this day calls me a gold digger because having a job and supporting ones self was important to me in a partner. I don’t care about the specific dollar amount they have, it’s the self motivation and work ethic that I admire in a partner. 

Older family members (parents, grandparents) aren’t as bad because I’ve shown my responsibility and they respect my work ethic. Family member of the same or similar age (siblings, cousins, etc) are much worse with it. In the future, we ready to be asked to help with any financial emergencies big or small. In their eyes, good jobs equals good paychecks. 

My advice is this; let them talk and say whatever they want. Keep your finances private. Don’t talk about money, what you have bought or intend to buy. Set clear boundaries. For me, I moved to a neighboring county and visit only occasionally.  For holidays, I set a firm budget ahead of time and stick to that. Christmas isn’t about money unless they think you’ve got it."

He agreed to go to breakfast with me and his brother a few months ago. During that visit he asked for a trip to the beach. I planned the trip according to his break from basketball but 2 days before we left, he didn’t feel like going. I saw him again on Christmas so I guess once this year is a little misleading. I’ve seen him once beside holiday gatherings. He attends Christmas at my mothers house long enough to pick up his gifts.

You should not be made to feel like a hyper sexual vixen because you want a sexual relationship with your husband. You sound like you were married to my ex. Lol Wanting to have as much or as little sex as you desire is perfectly normal. Your mate should mesh well with that. We were married 2 years and have been divorced about 16 years.

Ethics,f4qr5vv,t3_dlj09y,1571757185.0,"More information... Couple years ago, a lady was drinking and ran a red light in Lexington, Ky. She went to jail. Her daughter, who has autism, became a ward of the state and is now in the care of the company that I work for. Mom was able to send letters to the agency and we read those to her but until the Guardian completes an investigation, we can’t contact her back. The former guardian that we had worked with retired and now there’s a new one and this has been lost among the system once again. My client is the sweetest person. She is mid twenties but she misses her mom immensely. 

There is no allegations of her mom ever mistreating her and she tells nothing but wonderful things about her. She tells of growing up in a stable home with her mom. She was arrested for DUI after running a stop sign and hitting another car. The occupants were injured and she was indicted on felony charges. She has spent her time in jail and paid her debt to society. 

From her letters, I know that she’s in a halfway house in Lexington. I just want her to know that her daughter is ok. She is well taken care of and we love her as well. She misses her so much and she often gets sad when she thinks about her mom and we remind her that her mom is looking for her too and that she will get to see her again. That’s all I want to happen.  I’m with her girl about 6 days a week and we’ve gotten close. But I’m also a parent and I would be so worried about my child but especially a child with a disability that makes her so vulnerable. 

I don’t really know what to do here.  I’ve tracked down the moms old Facebook account and she hasn’t posted anything since before going to jail. There’s a brother as well and I’ve found his Facebook but nothing has been posted in years. I’m also afraid of posting anything to Facebook because of someone from my job seeing it. I know her name and that she’s supposed to be in a halfway house somewhere around Lexington, Ky, USA. No recent information on the brother at all. Maybe though, if any of this sounds familiar and you may know this family personally, please contact me. She talks about Brand-O, Mamaw and Papaw. 

Otherwise, any advice on how to relay to this lady without completely losing my job??"
internetparents,f3okegk,t3_dhhrwv,1571020299.0,"Self care is first and foremost. Take care of you. Then, try to settle your anxiety. Think about the reasons you went into that field and the little ones that depend on you to be their voice. Keep a journal. Not only to document your feelings and daily events but it will be therapeutic to release all that. Sounds like she’s just a bitch and will always have a person to pick on. If not you, it would be someone else. You need to communicate everything to an HR person or the director that is probably already onto it since you said you were defended. Regardless, document every incident that you feel she is being unreasonable or out of line. Try to be as factual as possible and keep dates/times. Report her to the director as needed and then report higher if you need to. Do not let her bully you into abandoning your career. You’re going to be fine!"

We did try some medication only to help with school/academics. We never used it to control his behavior, only to improve his focus. We also closely monitored the effectiveness, benefits and side effects. We always had a goal in mind to be medication free.  My son was also involved with speech, occupational and behavioral therapy as well. Medication should not be your only approach, but another tool in your toolbox IF you choose to use it. We did not like the effects of the medications (drowsiness, delayed responses, zoning out, etc) and had to try different ones to find one that was effective for him.  ADHD medications are not all the same.  Be very specific with your child’s doctors about goals and expectations.  My son was delayed with all milestones. Began receiving supports at 1 year old. Started school at age 5 and struggled through primary and middle school. Held back in Kindergarten and 5th grade. Our son struggled academically, he was rowdy but not necessarily worse than our other non ADHD son. We needed a way to help him in school. We used Focalin XR to help him develop good study habits and learn basic core concepts. Been medication free since he was 10.  He is 15 now and just started High School, he’s doing great and once he found his “thing” he really blossomed and found himself. It will come. The road just may be a little bumpier, but everything will come together.  We use his interests as motivation to well in school. 

In the meantime, don’t forget yourself in the chaos. Take time to talk to someone. From someone who had a full on ugly cry in my sons principals office, don’t forget to seek support and time for yourself and your husband/wife.  Things can and will get ugly. We have had many tears, pleas and bad report cards but ultimately despite his struggles, he’s a good kid. And yours is too."

AskReddit,exn1km2,t1_exl932v,1566444086.0,"Biscuits and gravy is a US Breakfast Staple. 

A simple recipe for biscuits is to use 2 cups self rising flour, 1 cup of butter, 3/4 Buttermilk or whole milk. Mix into a dough and cut 3 inch rounds, butter tops before baking and bake at 350’ for about 15 minutes.  Biscuits should be golden brown on top and light and fluffy in the middle. 

Gravy is best made from scratch using the leftover grease from pork sausage or bacon. Remove the meat and leave only the hot grease in the pan. Add all purpose flour with a whisk until you get a Carmel brown, thick roux. Remove Slowly add cream or milk while continuing to whisk until gravy thickens and is a light chocolate brown. 

Break biscuits into small chunks and pour gravy over it, serve with the bacon or sausage you made. 

Some people make gravy using vegetable oil. I’ve never been successful at it.  Traditionally, biscuits and gravy is served for breakfast with other items breakfast meats (sausage, bacon, ham), eggs, hash browns."

AskReddit,ewq6r7p,t3_cpldy2,1565658225.0,"Pros... 

* New scenery
* Meeting new people
* Experiencing new restaurants/small town dives
* My favorite part has always been learning about history through tours, exhibits and experiencing the area. 

&#x200B;

Cons... 

* Doing Laundry, Finding a laundromat, time wasted sitting there.  Then there's the packing of detergent, etc or purchasing it for each use.  
* Every meal costs money.  We travel with snacks but still, almost every meal costs money.  Even outside of eating 3 meals a day in a restaurant, we always have road snacks, drinks, fruit, etc with us. 
* Mechanical Issues.  Whether it be a flat tire or a major issue, its going to cost time and money.  You could be stranded for hours depending on where you are traveling and paying for roadside assistance still doesn't guarantee that they will be close by when you break down.  

Different Methods of Travel...

* Hotels are more expensive but offer a clean soft bed and a hot shower.  Some hotels offer laundry and breakfast. 
* Motorhome/RV traveling has the added expenses of the unit, insurance and fuel.  They aren't cheap.  But they do offer living space while you're traveling (great for seniors or kids) and your own space once you are parked.  Taking a second vehicle behind it is a hassle and very useful for getting around the vacation town, grocery/supply trips, emergencies, etc. 
* 5th Wheel Camper traveling is my favorite.  The camper itself is huge with plenty of living and private spaces.  Once we are set up, we have our truck to travel around and sight see.  Most 5th wheel kitchens are big enough to stock up on necessities and I usually only have to purchase meat and fresh produce once we're set up.  We also have a bumper pull camper and it is very similar to the 5th wheel with the exception of being a smaller size."
femalefashionadvice,eue71n3,t3_cg0c7x,1563736976.0,"Jeans are important. Look at classic cuts with good quality. Always try them on to ensure perfect fit. 

Outerwear, Jackets should be of a good quality material. These are worth the investment. 

Shoes are always worth the money. 

I do not spend a ton of money on any “fashion” jewelry or something I’ll only wear once. Classic jewelry that can worn often (pearls, diamond studs) are worth the investment. 

Shirts and tops is where you can save some cash. Look at the clearance racks first. Then search for “basic staples” that are versatile for different looks. I wear tons of blacks and grays, so I always have several 3/4 sleeve boat-necks on hand. They can be worn with jeans, dressy pants or a skirt."

I’m thinking that #2 on your list is no longer in business. Not sure if maybe there’s another gas station in that area but I know the big Marathon is closed. Food was always shit there so I doubt that’s the one you were thinking of.

Could it have been Deane Texaco?  That’s very close within the stations you mentioned, centrally located and their food is AMAZING!!"
femalefashionadvice,etpxlvb,t3_ccs7fn,1563067184.0,Maybe 2-5%... The trick for me has always to buy good quality pieces in timeless or classic styles so I can mix and match. Always buy the quality over the bargain. Coat may have cost a little more but I’ve used it 4 years and fully intend to pull it out of the closet when it gets cold.
