BipolarReddit,fqytxh8,t3_ghjdk9,1589754494.0,"I can totally relate to you.  My mom has seen me when I was depressed enough to go into the hospital (actually I had a manic episode triggered by antidepressants), and a few times after that, when I've mentioned I'm feeling depressed, she'll say, ""I can see it your eyes.""  But other times, when I'm more mildly depressed, my mom will say, ""You seem fine to me.  Everyone gets down sometimes.""  

If it doesn't show on the outside, people seem to have trouble believing you really have anything wrong with you.

What has bothered me over the last couple days is that one of my friends called and told why I'm one of her best friends.  ""You're so quiet, but so peaceful...""  

Other people have said the same thing...I seem very calm, serene...

The thing is, I hardly ever feel like that on the inside!  I was really, really abnormally quiet in the past, to the point that it was obviously abnormal--it was probably due to mental illness/some form of social anxiety...and I also get quieter than normal when I'm depressed--so I associate being quiet with something being \*wrong\* with me.  It doesn't seem like a compliment at all, and I'm not really feeling ""peaceful"" or ""serene"" most of the time either...so it is frustrating that people see me that way.  

I've also done crazy things, but somehow I maintain some outward calm to the point I never really \*seem\* hypomanic or manic unless you know me really well, I suppose.  One time a friend was talking about drinking too much at a wedding and said to me, ""You would never do that...I can't see you drinking...""  The next year, I drank so much vodka at a party that I basically blacked out afterwards.  But I have some kind of outward reserve that lasted through the vodka, I guess, so I don't think people even knew I had been drinking too much."

There is no control group for ""patients who would have been put on ventilators but weren't."" I read some reports that ventilators may damage the lungs further.  I don't really know, but wanted to correct that point about 100% of them would have died without a ventilator, because I don't think we know that."
AskReddit,f4uclwj,t3_dlu41v,1571805645.0,"As an introvert, how do you let a roommate know that you are done talking not because you have something specific to do, but just need some downtime or just can't keep up a conversation for that long?

I know I need a lot of space to myself and don't always like living with others for that reason.  Anyway, I have lived with the same roommate for several years.  Initially I didn't know her and we rarely talked...over the years we've talked more / gotten to know each other more and she's become more part of my social life too.  However...she also doesn't have much of a social life of her own right now or commitments in the evenings. Furthermore, she's mostly home (when not in class) sitting in the shared space during the days. I am also home during the days (I work from home, but in my room). This means that every time I go into the 'common space,' she's usually there and wants to talk.  She basically starts talking from the moment I walk in the kitchen. Usually it's asking for advice on something or telling me about things she's dealing with. I don't actually like this about my personality, but I don't have time / patience / energy for more than an hour of these conversations a day.  I have a busier life than her, so if it's the middle of the day, I have something else I'm trying to finish before going out.  And sometimes at the end of the day, I don't have anything specific to do. Once I get home in the evening (usually later than her), I talk to her while cooking / cleaning up, but after an hour or so, I just want to go to my room and 'do nothing.'

The problem is that I feel bad about walking away from these conversations.  I guess I feel guilty for being so much of an introvert. But if I don't walk away (from the common space), she will just keep talking to me indefinitely.  She doesn't seem to have anything else pressing to do. So what's the best way to end these conversations without being rude?

(I don't have a problem with talking to her per se, it's just that the conversations feel one-sided in that I'm always the advice-giver and they don't typically end unless I end them.)"
