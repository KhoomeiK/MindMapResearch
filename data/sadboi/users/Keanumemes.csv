Deliriants,fbtgldk,t3_dv0zuc,1577078149.0,"Man this is so well written. I have never tried any deliriant, nor do I intend to, but I have tried drugs that have sent me into extreme states of paranoia so I feel I can somewhat understand the feelings of impending doom.
The way this is written makes it so clear and precise, Which is something I dont think I could ever do on any drug. When the dreams were being described I imagined them very vividly and the whole time I was reading I was on the edge of my seat, especially when the 'spirits' we're invading the house.
This is impressive and I maybe dont comprehend the actual horror of a benzo trip or any deliriant for that matter, But I'm glad the few of them that are out there are so gripping."
