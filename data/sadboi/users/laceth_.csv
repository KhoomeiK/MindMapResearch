after reading your first post, i’ve been freaked that something similar would happen to one of my two cute pups, and just this morning when i went to let them both outside in the front of my apartment, someone from in my building (sounded like a man) opened their window and started whispering one of my dogs names and trying to get him all hype.  i’m sure it was just one of my neighbors who overheard me saying my dog’s name before tryna be funny, but i don’t have any kind of a relationship with any of my neighbors, so we ain’t on that level lol.  and it scared the shit outta me."
