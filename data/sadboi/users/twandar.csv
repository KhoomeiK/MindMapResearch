BipolarReddit,fr04dcu,t3_glv38q,1589783383.0,I can totally relate. I really miss my in person support group but this subreddit is great too. Welcome!
BipolarReddit,fqvx72c,t1_fqvx09c,1589687243.0,That's a great name.
BipolarReddit,fqvt6ou,t1_fqvrxj3,1589684618.0,Yes I agree. Also the mention of time distortion. That is one thing that really surprised me when I started meds. I was no longer losing hours out of every day. Time was no longer jumping around like when I was in a dream.
1200isplenty,fqvse4x,t3_gl7i96,1589684111.0,"Just a reminder that 1200 is the minimum for average adult woman (stated in the subreddit info). If you are a teenager, male, a taller female, or a more active athlete then 1200 is not enough and you probably will not feel satisfied. Make sure you are aiming for a healthy amount of calories. I'm 5'8"" fe overweight. My goal is 1800 for losing 1-2 pounds a week. I never eat below 1400. I like this subreddit because it shows how you can still eat food you like and stay below your calorie goal. Just don't take the name literally because 1200 is not enough for most people."
bipolar,fqvos1k,t3_gl7aht,1589681822.0,"I suggest you call your doc and therapist. If you aren't sleeping you definitely need a med change. Though it does sound like you may be in some real danger too. Maybe talk to your mom. If she's really scared, it's definitely not all in your head. That doesn't mean you brain isn't making things worst though. Call you doc now."
BipolarReddit,fqrk6pa,t1_fqri72w,1589586005.0,"All of those are definitely symptoms of bipolar. And feeling a special connection is a delusion which is a psychotic feature. You don't have to have full blown psychosis to have psychotic features or symptoms. I never realized how much of my life I've had hallucinations and magical thinking. These are probably my least harmful symptoms and my first to show up when I'm on the upswing. Also I never realized hypersexuality was a symptom until I was diagnosed with bipolar. I just thought I was reckless. But looking back in not always like that. It's party of the disorder. And you ask why your life had been so destructive. Because you were mentally ill. You were sicker than you realized. Being bipolar effects everything in life. Maybe your friend is more successful because he's been diagnosed and treated. There is hope now. It'll get better. The more you learn about the diagnosis, the more you will understand about your life. It was really mind blowing for me to reread years of my journals with the new lens of bipolar. So much made sense that never did before."
bipolar,fqrgtjy,t3_gkj55w,1589584072.0,"I can totally relate. I'm often surprised I outlived my 20s. I wasn't diagnosed until age 39. So I lived for decades without proper medication. I live a very different lifestyle now. I used to move all the time. New job, new house, new friends every 6 months or so. Always on the move. Now I've been at one job for 6 years and in the same house for 8!!! Really strange. I especially have no idea how to have a healthy romantic relationship because I've had such unhealthy ones in the past. Sometimes i feel like I'm hopeless but who says we're done learning. I may not be the crazy adventurer I used to be but now I have the stability to plan responsible adventures. I don't really feel comfortable with this new me yet, but overall life is so much better on meds."
BipolarReddit,fqrfnty,t3_gkj5xx,1589583417.0,"Well the good news is that with a diagnosis there is treatment. I was diagnosed with bipolar 1 at 39. I don't have diabetes but I am definitely overweight and at risk for it. I'm still struggling to eat better. Making small changes but I feel like I need to be doing more. Meds have helped me take more control of my life though. It doesn't really matter if you're labeled with bipolar 1 or 2. Everyone is different anyway. I have rapid cycling so I have a lot of mixed episodes or dysphoric mania. I used to be seething with rage. I hated everyone and everything which made it hard to keep a job or an intimate relationship. I don't feel that at all anymore. I feel like I can observe my feelings without them making me out of control. My main advice is to take meds seriously and be patient. It takes a long time to find the right combo and give meds a chance to level you out. It doesn't happen over night. I felt a little relief here or there,a good moment, then a good day, then a good week. It took about 2 years for be to be stable but now I'm very happy with my meds. Use a mood tracking app to help now changes in mood, symptoms, and side effects. It's very helpful when reporting back to doc and therapist. Therapist can help you make sense of the bipolar symptoms you experience. Maybe ask why the doc chose bipolar 1. What symptoms do they notice? I never thought I was manic either but once I learned more it's funny how textbook my symptoms really are. It's a confusing disorder that affects a lot more than just mood. Let me know if you have any other questions. I'm happy to chat."
bipolar,fqosxq5,t1_fqk4qwe,1589523904.0,That's a shame that you can't find a quality therapist. It's definitely helped me to make sense of things. I've also gone to a NAMI support group which was awesome. I don't know if they are meeting online somehow now or not but if you can find a support group they are free and honestly can be just as helpful than a therapist. I guess this subreddit is similar to one in a way.
bipolar,fqk6o5d,t1_fqk2d5n,1589421178.0,Good job! Journaling definitely helps me. Sounds like you're off to a great start. Just be patient. Meds aren't an immediate fix. It takes time but it is worth it.
bipolar,fqk1hx7,t1_fqk0d1l,1589418552.0,"You're right that meds make you feel of at first. It takes time to adjust. Be patient. Personally I had a lot of negative side effects from lamotrigine even though it's one of the mildest mood stabilizer out there. And I have hardly any side effects from my antipsychotic Seroquel. Everyone is different. Do you use a mood tracking app? If not, I highly recommend you start. Just takes a few minutes at end of day to note overall mood, symptoms, and side effects. Then you'll have good data to report back to doc about meds changes. It's all a science experiment. The better your are at collecting and analyzing the data, the better you be at finding the right meds. Good luck and hang in there"
bipolar,fqk0x10,t3_gjb71t,1589418267.0,"Finding the right meds can be a challenge especially when you're still young and your body is still growing and changing. You have the right attitude though. There is definitely hope out there. I wasn't even properly diagnosed until I was 39 so it took me until I was over 40 to find the right meds. So you have a huge head start on me, lol. Do you use a mood tracking app? If not, I highly recommend you start one. Only takes a few minutes at the end of the day to note overall mood, symptoms, and side effects. Then you'll have good records to report back to doc. Finding the right meds is a science experiment. The better you are at collecting data and analyzing the results, the easier it will be too find the right combo. Good luck and hang in there!"
bipolar,fqk023j,t3_gjb7j0,1589417841.0,Just so you know 50 mg of lamotrigine is a low dose. It's more likely that your doc will continue to increase your lamotrigine before adding a new med. But antipsychotics can be used as sleep aids at low doses and mood stabilizers at higher doses. The name is unfortunate. They can be very helpful drugs.
bipolar,fqcjcew,t1_fqcijvb,1589259723.0,I take 600-800 daily as my main mood stabilizer.  I started on just 25mg at bedtime for sleep and that would put me straight out. I just kept wanting more. Now I can take it throughout the day without getting drowsy. I still take biggest dose of 400 two hours before bed. I love it. It's my chill pill.
bipolar,fqcimv3,t3_gi19ez,1589259185.0,"Definitely talk to a therapist. That's what they are there for. I was in counseling for ""anger issues"" for over a decade before finally being properly diagnosed at 39. Anger, irritability, agitation, and rage can be symptoms of mania. Unlesd you have a plan to immediately harm someone therapists won't do anything but talk to you. Meds have helped me a lot. You might want to find a psychiatrist too especially since you have a predisposition. Don't wait until things get worse. Seek help now so you have a support system in place. Good luck."
bipolar,fqchwl9,t3_gi2hyn,1589258643.0,"Nope,I need my Seroquel. First time in my life I've ever had a regular sleep schedule."
bipolar,fqch7ln,t1_fqbieh4,1589258136.0,"It helps me to think about taking meds as a science experiment. I try not to focus too much on what I hope will happen or what I'm afraid will happen. Just take a prescribed, gather data, and analyze results. Also let the experiment run its course a bit. Most drugs have side effects but most side effects do go away in time. It's totally understandable to be nervous. Do you have a therapist too, that can help you sort through these feelings?

I think Seroquel is working well as a mood stabalize for me. I'm so grateful to be off lamotrigine because I had a lot of negative effects from that one. I've been pretty stable close to a year now; wow I can't believe it's been so long! I like that I can adjust dose daily as needed. But again remember it took a long time to get up to a therapuetic dose. Low dose works as sleep aid, higher doses for mood stabilizer."
bipolar,fq8qnyt,t3_ghdi56,1589172841.0,My heart goes out to you. I just lost one of my dogs to a very similar situation. Hope your cat fares better. Hang in there. Not knowing is sometimes the hardest part.
BipolarReddit,fq8q01h,t1_fq88187,1589172331.0,"Same here, raging maniac most my life. My ""anger issues"" weren't properly diagnosed until 39."
bipolar,fq8pk8n,t3_gh9puh,1589172000.0,Dalio and emoods have free versions that are great to start with. If you like them you just pay a one time fee to upgrade.
bipolar,fq8p3o2,t3_ghghmf,1589171652.0,"I highly recommend using a mood tracking app. Helps me so much in keeping track of symptoms and side effects so that I can more accurately report back to doc because other wise my memory is shit.  

1) dalio--I use dalio to track my overall mood, symptoms and side effects like headache, tired, period, etc. I also mark a med change if I forget to take med or if my dosage changed. Easy to search and find the day in the calendar then. I also journal a few sentences about how my day went. Then the day before I see my doc I can look back through my entries and make a list of positives and negatives since the last time I saw them.

2) emoods--i use emoods to qualify the extent of my depression, hypomanic, anxiety, irritability, healthy diet, hypersexuality, quality sleep ect. I also record my hours of sleep. So I can use the graphs in this to see trends. I've been pretty stable for last 6 months or so. If something changes I'll notice it here first.

3) habits--This is a great little list app. I simple have a list of positive habits I'm trying to build and I check them off if I did then that day. Examples: no alcohol, walk dog, cook.

4) I have a Garmin vivosmart watch. A cool feature for people with bipolar is that it records my sleep.

I've been using these apps for over 400 days. It only takes me about 5 min at the end of the day. Start small and add you get used to it you'll probably think if other things to track."
bipolar,fq8nviq,t3_ghgjc7,1589170724.0,I totally agree. Belittles our struggle.
bipolar,fq7a7c9,t1_fpx82x9,1589143774.0,"I try to take it two hours before bed. But make sure you're already in your PJs, teeth brushed, dog let out, etc. Because you might get too drowsy to do those tasks. One time I work up in the middle of the night and tripped over my dog and fell. So I just learned to be careful. My coordination on big bedtime dose is like being really drunk. It's half life is 6 hours. So you can experiment with dosage and timing and see what works best for you. Don't be afraid to try it. Worse case scenario you really don't like it and you ask for something else.

Bipolar meds and alcohol just don't mix period. Alcohol is a depressant and will affect your mood no matter what meds you're on. I used to drink a lot in my 20s. I didn't figure out the negative effects it was having until I quit. Now I can notice the effects after just one drink. The next day I feel like an antisocial slug who just wants to binge eat carbs. Meds cannot do their job if you are self medicating with other drugs like alcohol or caffeine. Go to the party and just act stupid sober. You'll fit right in. Drunk people can't tell the difference. Dance, flirt, or do whatever it is you think you need alcohol to give you courage do. Trust me you'll have a million less regrets if you stay sober and just have fun."
bipolar,fpwmrmp,t1_fpwlwsd,1588966198.0,How do you think an apology could negatively affect her recovery? I think if you're genuine and only apologize without placing any blame on her it could only be a positive thing.
bipolar,fpwlb4c,t1_fpv6231,1588965463.0,I started on just 25 mg of Seroquel before bed and it works totally knock me out. You definitely need to give your body time to adjust so expect to go to bed early. I don't remember how long it took me until I started taking it during the day too. But I tend to be on the hyper side. That's why I think it's a good drug for me. It chills me out. It had one of the strongest sedating effects of antipsychotics so if that's an issue it might not be right for you. Still I think it takes time to figure it out.
bipolar,fpwkrr4,t3_gfz3k9,1588965187.0,"I don't think it ever hurts to apologize. But are you really asking for more than that? Are you trying to rekindle the relationship? If you honestly just want to apologize and say your peace, go for it. If you're looking for something else i can't tell you."
bipolar,fpue6wp,t3_gfk39t,1588910709.0,"Yes, I definitely notice my head itching when I'm on the upswing. Clothes get scratchy and bug me too. Lights get too bright and white noise like buzzing lights can drive me crazy. I think it's just being over stimulated in general."
bipolar,fpudv7e,t3_gfkg7n,1588910490.0,Ask her all these questions and talk through everything you're wondering about. That is exactly what they are there for.
bipolar,fpud8b0,t3_gfko9t,1588910062.0,"I love Seroquel. I take pretty high dose. 600-800 daily. I can adjust as needed. When I'm feeling anxious and amped up I take more. If I'm tired and sluggish I can take less. It's working great for me. But it took a long time to get here. I think one of the tricky aspects of bipolar meds is that they don't just stop your cycling. Imagine your mood episodes like a large wave. The meds don't just stop the wave, they decrease it gradually. So you have to stay on the meds long term and give them time to stabilize you. It took me about 2 years until I felt stable. Even then we were still adjusting and fine tuning. I started on lamotrigine which had a lot of negative side effects for me but it was helping my moods. So my docs kept me on it until I got up to a high enough dose of Seroquel. So I recently got off lamotrigine and am very happy with my meds now about 2.5 years after starting. I strongly suggest using a mood tracking app to track your overall mood, symptoms, and side effects. Then you can use that to report back to your doc. If you don't trust her, find a new one. But give meds a chance. It is a really slow process and it's a lot of work but worth it in the end. Good luck."
bipolar,fpuc4o1,t3_gfh68i,1588909342.0,"I walked in my undergrad ceremony but it didn't mean much to me. The only fond memory was laughing at the streakers that ran across the stage in just snorkel masks. I guess the one pic I have in my gown in front of the school with all my awards is a nice memento but it's not really the gown that mattered. I didn't attend or do anything for my master graduation and I don't regret it. I wish I would have had a party though. I'm just not very sentimental when it comes to time consuming traditions that mean little too me. Think about what would mean something to you. It doesn't have to be what others think. If you just want that one pic, borrow a gown from a friend that's buying one."
BipolarReddit,fpqhhky,t3_gez06y,1588822909.0,That's a really hard question because in my experience whenever anyone acted like I was crazy and needed help I would get really defensive and feel like I was being persecuted. Those types of delusions can be common with bipolar and so it would make me mistrust and push the person away instead of getting help. I think it would be best to bring it up when your son is calm or depressed. If in a rage there is probably no reasoning with him. If he's violent you may just need to call the cops or ambulance. Then again calling the cops feels shitty and can be dangerous and have lasting legal repercussions. Maybe you could recruit the wife's help. Saying he can't be around the kids might shock him into seeking help. I'm sorry I don't have better answer for you. Maybe try the subreddit for bipolar significant others. They might have first hand experience.
BipolarReddit,fpqcjg5,t1_fpqbvvb,1588819765.0,The whole point of medication is to avoid episodes. So when you start noticing symptoms you should call your doc and adjust your meds. Think of it this way. A diabetic cannot just take the same dose of insulin all the time and be healthy. They have to constantly monitor their blood sugar and adjust their meds accordingly. It's the same for us with bipolar. I use a mood tracking app so I can track patterns and notice symptoms before they get extreme. Definitely call your doc. Meds can help.
BipolarReddit,fppz3j6,t3_gekfwg,1588811952.0,Have you talked to your doc and asked for a med change? That's always step one for me.
bipolar,fppy8zy,t3_genvfn,1588811479.0,"For me it's the opposite, Adderall affected my bipolar meds. Increased my psychotic symptoms and anxiety plus kept me up at night. Now I'm on Seroquel and straterra. The Seroquel works like a chill pill. It's calls me down and so it help with the hyperactive aspects of ADHD. Straterra seems to help me function. Focus still isn't great but tolerable."
bipolar,fppx82g,t3_geqf6s,1588810913.0,"That's exactly what your therapist is for, to talk things out. No reason to be embarrassed. I'm sure they've heard worse than a young adult with sex dreams. I know my therapists have heard worse from me, ha. Seriously, give it a try."
bipolar,fppwn6m,t1_fpp01dv,1588810595.0,I too swear by Seroquel. First time I've ever had a regular sleep schedule in my life.
bipolar,fppvdjz,t3_geufa9,1588809891.0,The term you're looking for is dysphoric mania instead of euphoric. My most common state. I think this is a really misunderstood symptom of mania. I was always seething with rage.
BipolarReddit,fpisqfj,t3_gdpglr,1588647865.0,If you weren't sleeping at all and having paranoid delusions sounds like bipolar 1. But really the label doesn't matter so long as you're getting proper treatment. Do you like and trust your psychiatrist and therapist? Have you asked why you diagnosis is what it is? They are there to help you. Ask them these questions.
BipolarReddit,fpbyico,t3_gces9w,1588482127.0,I'd call my doc and adjust meds immediately. I can try with all my might but I can't change my brain without the help of meds.
bipolar,fpby0gr,t3_gcfcqx,1588481730.0,"Yes, of course it can cause mania. Stimulants are uppers. That's what they do. I am diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar. I was on Adderall for years and it helped my depression and ADHD but it also caused some negative effects (sleep disturbance, psychotic symptoms, and anxiety) which I didn't notice until I was more stable. It's easy to test the effects because they are immediate. With your doc permission experiment taking it some days and not others and record your symptoms and side effects. I chose to get off stimulants because it was affecting my sleep and making me feel more urgent about everything. It's not until I got off them that I realized they were also increasing my psychotic symptoms like hallucinations and magical thinking. I think because caffeine is so popular that as a society we tend to down play the strength stimulants. They are serious drugs even if you have a prescription."
bipolar,fpbx7ro,t3_gcfwpg,1588481109.0,Sounds like a good plan to me. This is exactly what one should do if they feel symptoms building. Touching base with therapist and doc and adjusting meds as needed. Good for you!!
bipolar,fpbwhzl,t3_gchaej,1588480565.0,"Yes u definitely experienced that. Before meds I was so overwhelmed with emotions that I couldn't define them. Everything just irritated me and I was angry all the time. All of a sudden with meds I was able to feel and understand individual feelings. Glad you found something that's working right away. Still be patient. It can take a long time to stabalize. (Btw, BPD stands for borderline personality disorder. If you mean bipolar disorder it's just BD.)"
bipolar,fpbvkqw,t1_fpbo56i,1588479857.0,"I agree with this. 25 mg Seroquel will work as a sleep med. When I started it would totally knock me out. 5mg Adderall is not much. I'm not familiar with Vyvanse but it seems silly to be on two stimulants. Yes, you should call your doc and discuss whenever you have med questions. Don't wait."
BipolarReddit,fpbuw9g,t3_gcj20z,1588479348.0,Call around and ask for a diagnostic psychiatrist to help you figure out what's going on with you. The place I go made me see a therapist first and then she reported to the pdoc before my first appointment with him. Getting a proper diagnosis is the first step. It can be scary but it's a lot better to know what you're up against. I wasn't properly diagnosed until 39. I wish I would have figured it out earlier. Just don't give up. There is a shortage of psychiatrists so it's a chore to find one. Keep calling. My office isn't even open right now but they are checking messages and doing video appointments. So keep leaving messages. You can do it. It's worth knowing. Meds can be a miracle.

I find myself drawn to different textures at different times. It's comforting. So I don't think it's weird if it can help you calm yourself. As a teacher we have ""calm down kits"" in our classrooms. The kids have putty, koosh balls, stretchy bands, lava lamp like things to watch, etc. In DBT classes they talk about sensory strategies to ground yourself: smelling and squeezing an orange, holding an ice cube, etc. If it helps you, go for it."

bipolar,fp4xgbq,t3_gbc20n,1588309979.0,I struggle to get up in the morning. It helps me to schedule something with other people. I'm a teacher so right now I met with students online early a.m. so I have a reason to get up. If I don't have anything planned I will sleep all morning.
bipolar,fp4x0du,t3_gb9e8f,1588309628.0,"1) I wasn't properly diagnosed until age 39. I hope you don't have to wait that long. I suggest looking for a diagnostic psychiatrist that can help you figure out proper diagnosis. Keep asking. Keep fighting. My current doc changed my life!

2) if you do have bipolar be prepared for long experimentation with meds. It takes a long time for your body to adjust and for cycling to stop. More than months. It took me about two years to find right combo and stabalize.

3) your actual question-- An elevated state feels a lot like anxiety to me. I'm all amped up and don't know what to do with myself. So I usually pick avoidant behaviors like watching TV to drown out the noise of my brain thinking what should I do. Or I ruminate on one stupid thing I said early that day. I keep playing it over and over in my head, feeling guilty and ashamed even it was probably something other people didn't even remember. At bedtime I'm amped up, curious, and want to have a say in everything like giving people on Reddit advice they didn't ask for, ha. My antipsychotics have been a miracle drug. They definitely chill me out, calm me down , and help me sleep. So that's helped my anxiety a lot too. Does that help?"
bipolar,fp4vo9e,t3_gbbb4b,1588308601.0,"I can totally relate to what you're saying. I too struggle to figure out where to draw that line between insightful and delusional. I used to believe I was psychic. My friends believed it too and encouraged me. I have experienced many strange and magical synchronicities. But now, after observing the difference on meds, I understand that most of it at least delusional. (I do recognize that psychic phenomenon do exist and it's possible that bipolar can make me more perceptual but overall I do not have psychic abilities.) I think the misunderstanding is that delusions and hallucinations do not have to be severe or serious. Having psychotic symptoms is different than full blown psychosis. Magically thinking, dejavu, seeing signs in everything, special messages or connections in songs, books, shows, etc. are some of the first signs that I'm on the up swing. I also have mild visual, auditory, and olfactory hallucinations like a unidentifiable smell or Calliope music playing in the fan. These are not dangerous or disturbing. At most they are annoying but many are actually pleasurable. These symptoms are a concern only in the sense that they are warning me that things are amping up. I can up my dose of my antipsychotics and avoid a manic episode all together. So from your explanation it sounds very much like delusions which are very common among those if us with bipolar 1. But don't automatically be scared just because you've experienced psychotic symptoms. They aren't always horrible. Yours like mine sound pretty positive. And they don't always lead to full blown psychosis either. Learn to read the signs and adjust your meds accordingly and they end up being helpful. Happy to answer more specific questions if you have because I feel like this is a really misunderstood topic."
BipolarReddit,for9eon,t1_foqm9f1,1588008411.0,"I struggle too. My worst time is late at night. So just making a hard rule of no eating after 8pm helps me. Rationing out serving sizes right away also helps. So I can grab a container with 1 cup of raspberries instead of the whole container. Just not buying candy. I will eat the whole bag, I have no restraint. So I just don't buy it."
BipolarReddit,foqgy5b,t1_foq9ctc,1587993316.0,Same here. I'm working on losing weight. If you control your calorie intake you control your weight. I think those that gained a ton of weight just started binge eating without restraint. Personally I've always been a binge eater so I don't feel like it's the med causing any issue.
bipolar,fopki15,t1_fophz6t,1587963920.0,"Bipolar is a strange disorder in the sense that the symptoms are polar opposites. It's a hard thing to identify and understand. But the more you read and learn the more you will be able to understand how it challenges you. For example it was a huge epiphany when I realized hypersexuality is a symptom of my mental illness. I made really questionable choices when it came to sexual partners and I never understood why before. Or I used to believe I was psychic. Now I realize that I hallucinate and have delusions. Though those diagnosed with bipolar 1 do have a lot in common, the symptoms still manifest differently I'm everyone. For example, I am a rapid cycler which for me means in always cycling with a lot of dysphoric mania. I never had any bouts of stability until I was medicated. Some people have more distinct episodes of mania and depression. There is a lot to learn. I recommend reading some books out watching some videos on the topic. These forums are great for connecting with others and feeling less alone but not always the best resource for the hard facts. And yes I do have a psychiatrist and s psychologist. My psychologist was very helpful when I was first diagnosed to help me sort out what was real and what was just in my head. My psychiatrist prescribed my meds. In very fortunate to have a team I trust. I recommend looking for a new one of you don't have one now. Good luck."
BipolarReddit,fopd07v,t1_fopcljk,1587958424.0,"You know what, I didn't realize I did, but yes, my thoughts were always racing. I would ruminate about one stupid thing I said, or worry about a tall is have to complete. I never realized how out of control my thoughts were until the meds shut them off. I think you'll really like Seroquel once you adjust and figure out the timing and dosage. I take it throughout the day too. Helps my irritability from feeling over stimulated. It's a great all around chill pill."
bipolar,fopcp7y,t3_g8rra1,1587958217.0,"Yes, I've always had super vivid dreams. Whole other worlds exist to me in my sleeping state. They are so real that I sometimes confuse them with real life. I still dream the same but they don't hold quite the same magic since I'm now medicated. Now I can realize they are just dreams."
BipolarReddit,fopccxc,t1_fopblkq,1587957986.0,I take meds at 8pm on work nights which is about 2 hours before bed. Half life is 6 hours so you might need to give it more time. I always just struggle with leaving my dream world to wake up to this one. I will hit snooze for hours if I can. Once I am physically out of bed I'm usually fine. It's just that transition I really struggle with.
bipolar,fopbykd,t3_g8s1tj,1587957716.0,"It took me about two years to feel stabalized. It's still a lot of work but I'm feeling good about my med cocktail. I'm confident that I can spot an episode building and squash it with meds before it gets out of hand. I feel like for the first time in my life I can actually plan and set goals for myself. So yes it will get better. I highly recommend using a mood tracking app to note symptoms, side effects, mood, etc. It's helped me report back more accurately to my docs and to learn about myself. You have to be an active participant in your treatment for it to work. But it's worth it. Also just learning about the disorder and how it manifests in you is really important. Happy to answer more questions you may have. Hang in there."
BipolarReddit,fopb8er,t3_g8ser4,1587957224.0,"What time do you take it at night? I've always had issues getting up in the morning so it's not really any harder for me on Seroquel. But I will say your body gets used to higher doses over time. I started on just 25 mg and it would knock me straight out. Now I take 600-800 daily and function fine. It's been a miracle drug for me, my chill pill. I love how it slows me down. I feel calm for the first time in my life."
bipolar,fopawk3,t3_g8sfb3,1587957007.0,For life. I lived for decades unmedicated until I was properly diagnosed at 39. I will never go without meds again. Meds are a miracle even though it's a lot of work.
1200isplenty,foo7ugc,t3_g8lxm6,1587934197.0,What app is this?
BipolarReddit,foir16o,t3_g7m3q7,1587794260.0,I started on just 25 mg and that would completely knock me out. Now I take 600-800 daily and function just fine. I think doc is smart to start small and gradually increase. I think when people are put on a huge dose to start they complain of side effects and then give up on the med. But since you've had med before I don't know how that factors in. But I wouldn't worry about starting small. You can always increase. The smaller doses tend to be used as a sleep aide. At higher doses Seroquel can work as a mood stabilizer.
BipolarReddit,foiqnab,t1_foij4b4,1587793923.0,I agree with this. Call your doc. The fact that you are recognizing the change is the first step. Magical thinking is one of my first symptoms when I'm amping up. But now I know to look for it and can adjust my meds accordingly. Are you on an antipsychotic?
bipolar,foiqbko,t3_g7navx,1587793641.0,Talk to your doc. Lack of sleep is a hallmark symptom. Meds are the only thing that ever helped me. Seroquel is my magic chill pill. Calms me down and helps me sleep.
bipolar,fo3z8kr,t1_fo3wyof,1587495474.0,Maybe you can harness your need for drugs into proper bipolar meds. I love taking my meds. I want more. My doc gives me more. They really have been a miracle. I thought I was beyond help but antipsychotics have changed my life. Maybe you can find purpose in treatment. The current worldwide pandemic definitely is not helping anyone's brain health.
bipolar,fo3xdvi,t3_g59iaz,1587494560.0,"I wasn't properly diagnosed until age 39 but I feel like I've always been this way. I was always a mouthy, angry child. My sociability and friend groups would change a lot too from hiding out alone in my room to spending every night at friends' houses. I was an extremely active kid. I think having a strict school routine and bedtime in addition to tons of physical activity really helped me growing up. Went I went off to college let to my own devices I really went off the deep end."
bipolar,fo3w43j,t3_g5k16h,1587493934.0,Life gets better when you stop using and work with a doc to find the right prescription meds. I used to binge drink and use other recreational drugs. Alcohol in particular is a depressant. I never recognized the negative effects it was having on me until I stopped. Now if I even have one or two drinks I notice that I feel like a slug the next day. I just want to binge eat and watch TV. I know it seems like you're using drugs to help but they aren't really helping. If you want to get stable you're going to need to give it up. There's just no way around it. It's hard but worth it in the long run.
bipolar,fnt6fha,t1_fnt4qdq,1587235512.0,"Maybe it's a good time to get a new dog? I still have one dog so I'm grateful that my routine is the same and I still get some cuddles. I remember how hard it was to lose my first dog years ago. Such a void. 

The diabetes analogy really formed my philosophy on managing meds. A diabetic cannot just take the same dose of insulin everyday and expect to be healthy. They must constantly observe their blood sugar and adjust accordingly. It's the same for us with bipolar. We have to constantly observe our behaviors and adjust our meds accordingly. I have a script written for 600-800 mg of Seroquel daily. So I can adjust as needed. It's working for me but it also took me two and a half years of trial and error to get here. I think it's a really delicate balancing act. I approach it like a science experiment. Track as much data as I can using mood tracking apps, report to doc, adjust meds, track changes, adjust again. I got off a med last month so that simplifies things more. Hope this current setup works for awhile."
BipolarReddit,fnt51qn,t3_g3m4km,1587234753.0,I started on just 25 mg and it would put me straight out. Now I take 600-800 mg daily. I take 100mg tablets during day and function fine. My 400mg night dose I take about 2 hours before bed. There is no way I would take that larger dose and not be safely home and ready for bed because yes I feel drunk and sleepy.
bipolar,fnt4i0r,t3_g3mllc,1587234452.0,There is something you can do--call your doc.
bipolar,fnt2crp,t1_fnsyjmj,1587233280.0,"I agree that using a mood tracking app is a great practice. I use two: dalio and emoods. I use dalio to record my overall mood for the day (good, bad, meh), to track symptoms and side effects (headache, anxiety, tired, period, etc), and to journal a few sentences about my day. I use emoods to record my hours of sleep and my level of anxiety, depression, irritability, hypersexuality, etc. Then the day before I see my doc I go back over all my entries since the last time I saw him and I list all the positives vs negatives in my written journal. I have a really lousy memory so this is the only way I can accurately report to doc. Over time you start to see trends and figure out your signs of change. I can usually tell when hypomania begins because I stay up too late and start having some magical thinking. I up my antipsychotics for a couple days and then I'm back down to normal."
bipolar,fnsxcnk,t3_g3pe9n,1587230590.0,"I totally relate to this post. I'm a teacher and so in the last month I've had to learn a whole new job working from home, isolate from all my friends, and then I had to put my dog down this week. Normally I would have been a total wreck, barely making it through. But now on meds, I feel like I can actually handle these stressful life events. I'm stressed but I'm not sick with anxiety. I'm grieving but I'm not crumbling. Its an amazing and empowering feeling to be able to take care of myself."
bipolar,fnsw34h,t3_g3q1b7,1587229902.0,I definitely have these moments but I use it as a cue to up my antipsychotics. Usually I just up the dose for a couple days and then back to normal dose. I just unexpectedly had to put down one of my dogs this week so I understand your pain. Losing a best friend is tough.
polyamory,fnsvhnr,t3_g3qew1,1587229580.0,"I'm no expert as I'm new to the poly world myself but I have always believed in relationship anarchy. Relationship can be definitely in many different ways. You seem to keep assuming that romance and sexual compatibility are necessary for marriage but that's not true. There are a lot of other reasons people may marry. Have you heard the term nesting partner? People may marry someone that shares the same goals such as house ownership, raising a family, economic security, etc. Romance and sexually compatibility may not be a defining or necessary aspect of marriage."
bipolar,fn8tj6x,t1_fn8sktp,1586749857.0,"I'm sorry you're struggling. Don't give up. You just haven't found the right meds and the right therapy. DBT classes helped me a lot. But nothing helped more than meds. Meds make implementing the skills I learned in DBT more doable. There was no way I could control my sleep and other healthy habits before meds. Seroquel was the game changer for me. It's a lot of work to journal with mood tracking apps to note side effects, symptoms, etc and report back to doc. 2.5 years and we're still adjusting but move in the right direction a little more each time. Don't give up on meds."
BipolarReddit,fn8sv61,t3_g0ac1p,1586749370.0,I think the typical therapuetic dose is 200 but a lot of people take lower doses if in conjunction with other meds. I had cold like side effects from it too and after being on it for about two years I ended up getting off it recently.
BipolarReddit,fn8sjd1,t3_g0apd0,1586749132.0,I think you did the right thing. He could have really hurt you. He may not understand right now because he's sick. He'll probably be super embarrassed and regretful when he realized what he did. The added complication of social distancing makes it even worse. It will take awhile to get through it but don't blame yourself. You did what you had to do to get him help.
bipolar,fn8rxyi,t3_g0axv3,1586748693.0,"I believe meds are the only way to control this illness. It doesn't matter how good we have it in life, our brains are broken. Of course a good support system makes sticking to a routine of meds and therapy easier. Call your doc. Ask someone who loves you to help you call your doc. Things can get better. It takes time and it is hard but it's possible. Don't wait. Call now."
BipolarReddit,fn7qwm8,t3_g03ssl,1586725815.0,Hypersexuality is part of this illness. You deserve forgiveness. There are many sexual encounters I regret and I can't undo them. But I can recognize that I was ill at the time and that I've grown since then. Forgive your past self and appreciate what you've learned from that mistake.
loseit,fn7noq3,t1_fn7dlvd,1586723964.0,This is great advice. I too have been discouraged by how little progress I've seen in a month. But I am getting stronger. That's were I need to put my focus.

BipolarReddit,fn7l5bg,t3_g035jj,1586722514.0,"Live vicariously through crazy television. Californication, true blood, and happy are a few that hit the spot for me. Go for a crazy long walk, so far it's a challenge to get home. Journal or write fiction about what you'd like to do."

BipolarReddit,fn26qs9,t1_fn23b5j,1586579397.0,"Maybe they're making you a bit hypomanic. I'm on Seroquel now. That slows me down, chills me out. But being stuck at home is really messing with my schedule. Time gets distorted. Sleep gets off and everything kind of snowballs from there. I need to work harder on taking meds on time. Hope you get your insurance figured out soon."
BipolarReddit,fn1um9w,t1_fn1s2mt,1586570492.0,"Yours definitely sounds more intense than mine were. Doesn't hurt to talk to doc. I recently got off lamictal because of other side effects like balance and breathing issues. At least if it only happens when you miss a dose it's easy to avoid. When I would miss a dose the room would look cloudy, like there was fog in my living room and I'd feel a little drunk."
BipolarReddit,fn1r548,t3_fysoun,1586568183.0,I had headaches on lamictal. Usually every time I upped the dose. I had only had a few migraines in my life before but pretty common that first year or so of taking the drug.
bipolar,fmw4d6v,t1_fmv1kq1,1586439255.0,"I started on 25 mg and increased the dose slowly because I was having some allergic reaction. I would get flushed, sore throat, headache for a about a week each time I increased dose. Then those symptoms would subside. I had other side effects though too. Balance issue, word recall, and breathing issues which ultimately led to me getting off the med. But it did help stabalize me over the course of two year. I just recently got off it because I'm now on a high enough dose of Seroquel to work as a mood stabalize. But it look a long time for me to get up to that dose too. I started on just 25 mg of Seroquel and it would put me straight out. No way to function. But now I'm up to 600-800 mg and function just fine. It all takes time. You need to be patient and give meds a chance. But definitely talk to your doc about your concerns."
bipolar,fmv171g,t3_fxd5kd,1586403557.0,Good for you. Remember that it takes time to level out when starting meds. Be patient and give it some time to work. I will never go without me again.
BipolarReddit,fmv05l2,t3_fxg08l,1586402859.0,I used to get dejavu all the time. It always felt like I dreamt it before. I have extensive dream journals so I've always hoped I would find some evidence but never have. Now that I'm medicated I definitely experience it a lot less.
bipolar,fmuzo53,t3_fxh1tr,1586402531.0,You should always be concerned. You're noticing drastic changes in behavior. It's definitely worth talking to your doc.
bipolar,fmutmr1,t3_fxh7u2,1586398616.0,Every time I upped a dose of lamictal I felt sick. Your body does adjust and most symptoms go away with time. It took months to see marked improvement and about 2 years to be fairly stable. So this is a long process. But with that being said some meds will just not be a good fit. Talk to your doc.
BipolarReddit,fmut4vf,t3_fxi1l8,1586398306.0,Once I believed I was speaking to my dead grandmother and another time to a friend who committed suicide. It wasn't exactly auditory. I didn't hear it outside my body. I heard it inside my head and I would talk back in my head. Like mental telepathy. This was before my bipolar diagnosis. Now that I'm medicated I'm not sure I believe in those experiences anymore. It's more likely that they were hallucinations.
bipolar,fmurqec,t3_fxito3,1586397444.0,I get this feeling a lot when I'm manic. The whole world is connected in magical ways and I that there are messages or lessons to learn in all the synchronicities. I used to put a lot of power into those thoughts. Believed I was psychic or just good at picking up signs that others ignore. But now that I'm medicated I can see that a lot of those feelings were delusions. It's one of the first symptoms I get when I'm amping up.
bipolar,fmrdd4b,t1_fmr03bn,1586319997.0,"Yes, I agree with this. The unknown is scary and so stability can be scary. Being suicidal meant I wasn't afraid of death. Now I have this newfound fear of my own morality that I never felt before. Especially during these crazy times of a world epidemic. Before I would have been praying to catch the virus and put me out of my misery but now I'm scared. I actually want to live. Also taking responsibility for ones life is stressful. In the past I couldn't or wouldn't plan anything. I never budgeted my money and hardly even opened my mail. Avoidance was my chopping strategy for everything. Now that's become a really hard habit to break. I don't want to about everything anymore. I want my house to be cleaner. I want to be healthier. But trying means failure is possible. If you never try, you can never fail. And so I'm afraid of taking responsibility for myself. It is a scary situation."
bipolar,fmrbgre,t3_fwyt2h,1586318549.0,"Society is ready to comfort women? I don't think so. I am a loud, aggressive, stubborn woman and I've never felt much compassion for my struggles. But I also don't show my struggles. Like you I feel I can't breakdown and show weakness. I'm not denying the role toxic masculinity and misogyny pay because I do agree that it adds to the issue. But the bottom line is that It's just damn hard to seek help. I was in therapy for decades. It want until I was 39 and fought to find a diagnostic psychiatrist that I was finally properly diagnosed with bipolar and started proper treatment. You are not alone. Most of else have felt the horrible low you're at. Just know this, those thoughts are delusions. They are not true. There are a million different options, but the one I would recommend is keep seeking help. Find a doc you trust. Start taking meds and be patient. It takes a long time to stop cycling and get better but it's possible. Life can be better, better than I ever imagined before. Don't give up!"
bipolar,fmpzglq,t3_fwrdsm,1586290120.0,"Are you trying to overdose? If so, please seek medical help immediately. When I started on 25 mg it would totally knock me out but now I take 600-800mg daily. I do feel drunk after taking my large night time dose but it doesn't knock me out anymore. I think the problem is more coming off the med than going on it. But idk."
bipolar,fmpyvwc,t3_fwrdum,1586289827.0,Yes it can definitely be a symptom of bipolar. Those are very concerning thoughts. Please contact your doc about a med adjustment. If you are planning to act on those thoughts please contact doc immediately.
bipolar,fmdrh9v,t3_fuk5n9,1585975697.0,"I definitely have experienced delusional relationships, so yeah, I guess you could call it that. I think someone's my soul mate. Like everything had aligned to bring that person to me just like in Hollywood movies. But usually it's a person I hardly know. Once I was convinced that my professor and I had a relationship. He shoot me looks in class that I read in to to mean entire conversations. Another example could be that I sometimes confuse my dreams with real life. So I have memories and experiencing of building relationships that don't actually exist in real life. Honestly the lack of this feeling has been hard t to cope with. I don't know what it's like to be attracted to someone in a healthy way. I just keep waiting for those feeling."

bipolar,fma9hw6,t3_ftwv7b,1585887359.0,"Damn. Maybe there is a free clinic somewhere. When I was unemployed I once saw a great doc for free.

This subreddit is something I suppose."
