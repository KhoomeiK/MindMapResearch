Of course Tifa, is uncertain and wary because she knows Cloud is misremembering things from their time together as well, so she must proceed a lot slower as she worries for him. 

But she really likes and cares for Aerith.

Tifa and Barret are the heart of the game for me and their interactions are the best. I loved the time spent with just them two in the party, and they have by far the best writing. And I'd like to mention that I also really like little Marlene in this. Her VA did a great job.

Aeris, unfortunately, looks great, but is definitely one of the weaknesses for me, which is sad because she has a large part to play and limited time. Her VA is for me the worst. And also she spends most of her time with Cloud and her interactions are mostly with Cloud, which really bring the not-so-great dialogue and acting into sharper focus because Cloud is so damn laconic - he doesn't do banter and doesn't even respond to half of what you say to him, so Aeris can come across looking really forced and weak, writing wise.
