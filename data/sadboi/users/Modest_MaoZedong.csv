medicalschool,fpkrq25,t1_fpjz0un,1588699879.0,"YUP. It's also really condescending sometimes when used by patients' family members or even patients at work. Like, because I can't be with my 94 year old mom in the ER for her 7th fall this year, I'm going to call you 15 times in 2 hours and DEMAND constant updates from the nurse and the doctor...but remind you that you're a ""hero"" while also gently reminding you that no one has called to update you in half an hour as promised :)  The use of the word hero makes people feel good about treating healthcare workers like personal assistants...not to mention the hero pizza parties that completely absolve admin from giving anyone merit raises or hazard pay.

My personal favorite email so far that I've gotten from work throughout the pandemic was the one praising us for our work, but the fine print at the bottom was that merit based pay increases would not be happening this year. LOL. We get 2-3x emails/day from our institution that are maybe 8 paragraphs in link. For >4 weeks. No one is reading these in their entirety anymore. It's hilarious to me that they think they can slide that little pearl in there and no one will see because it's at the bottom of their virtue signaling monologue."

Lucky the classes offered are genuine interests and I’m a very collaborative person so I’m actually really excited to learn the content and meet like minded people!

I am an ER tech now and did inpt psych and case mgmt for 3 years before ER! I’m also hoping being an older applicant helps. I have a somewhat legit explanation for what contributed to my trash grades in the past, but I also am insightful and definitely willing to accept that I was lazy, unmotivated and immature. I’m hoping all those things lead to at least an interview! Do you think I’m a good candidate for a special masters?

prephysicianassistant,fov7mjw,t3_g9qqzr,1588096696.0,Hey you are really close to 3.0 cGPA tho!!!! So straight up worst case scenario you take another year of classes and pull it just to the cut off and I guarantee you’ll get interviews. Your other stats are sexy! I think if you talk to admissions reps personally via email they can give you an honest answer as to whether or apply or to wait. There are definitely places that will take last 60 into consideration alone if your other stats are impressive.
Mcat,fouq0y4,t1_founbfq,1588088490.0,"I really appreciate this conversation being held. I’m doing a DIY post bacc right now and haven’t take the MCAT yet. I’ve worked in healthcare for years, but when I see those MCAT people it’s easy to think wow I’ll never score that high...I should give up before investing too much time and money. But all of us have invaluable aspects of our application that make us unique!! When talking to my peers at school, they have far better GPAs but are blown away by my real world experience and medical knowledge I have from working in healthcare so long. It makes me feel awesome to know that I have something that sets me apart. It’s easy to get down, but I think the whole picture of someone is really important. Of course, this depends on the school."

To be fair, I know exposure therapy because if I do get sick I have several weeks where I am ON TOP OF THE WORLD because I don't have any fears. Everytime I get sick afterwards I'm like...""wow. that is what is controlling my life? that's ridiculous! that was fine!"" but the fear sloooowly creeps back up into full blown phobia every.damn.time."

premed,fnqy5l4,t3_g3dd2e,1587174808.0,"Your questions aren't dumb. It's obvious that you are worried about success and I know how that anxiety feels so I truly wish you the best in overcoming it; however, your post is honestly kind of concerning. I hate condescending comments like this so I apologize if this is more annoying than helpful, but a HUGE part of medical school, being a physician, and your young adult years in general is personal growth and maturity. You can't force those things - they happen organically through life experiences. You can check ALLLL the boxes but if you are so worried about ""being the best"" and outdoing everyone else, it will show and you are probably going to be rejected from schools. I have plenty of friends who were rejected solely because all they had were boxes checked and no story, no hobbies, were immature, etc...and their gap year (or two) was the best thing to happen to their mental health and wildly helped them cope with the rigors and stress of med school.

&#x200B;

You're obviously intelligent. Set a schedule for yourself in college, like a 9-5 job, that gives you time to study during ""business hours"", and free time to explore, make new friends, and to do things you ENJOY!!!! One day medicine will be your life and your job. You will regret being so hyperfocused on it now when you didn't need to be. Go to class, don't get alcohol poisoning, use Snapchat and other young person things wisely, and don't push people away by being a pre-gunner :)

If you're ready for me to STFU and give you some advice and move on, here it is: become an EMT! I loooove my job as an ED Tech and a couple of med schools even require MS1s to go through EMT training as a first year! It's an awesome way to learn how to prioritize body systems and medical emergencies. If you're like me, you are a top down learner and having a general understanding of the human body in context will help you understand the micro concepts of bio/chem better.

I really hope college is awesome for you. UCLA is a great school. Enjoy yourself and good luck :)"

prephysicianassistant,fkv6ue7,t3_fkv16a,1584563269.0,"I wish you the best! I think it would be cool of you to do something volunteer or work related in underserved communities. For example, I worked at a free clinic for the homeless community on Friday nights and it was sooooo rewarding and educational. It wasn’t glamorous and sometimes was overwhelming but I would do it again."
prephysicianassistant,fkv6mfv,t3_fkvsg1,1584563144.0,Why do you want to work in derm?
Mcat,fkufu2b,t3_fkjyyt,1584548634.0,I’m so glad to see there are other derelict pre-meds who have the same humor as I do.

prephysicianassistant,fjxilkl,t3_ff66s0,1583674505.0,"Hey I’m an older student too- doing a second bachelors degree and applying to med school. My first exam in molecular bio back in school I got an 80, and it was an easy test. Not a horrid grade, not a good grade. All the 18yo pre meds were bragging about their 104s, 100s. I cried my eyes out though because I felt like with my experience and being older and more mature than other students, performing at this level and being one point away from a C was pathetic and that it was pointless for me to be in school if I was just going to amass B- grades. My professor told me that older students that go back to school always have a learning curve at the beginning and do poorly. Then they ABSOLUTELY ROCK IT!!!!! Some of the concepts in chem are abstract and strange, but once it clicks it becomes much easier to understand. I know you will remember this feeling and never let it happen again - my so so performance scared me and set me straight. Don’t give up! You have so much more to offer than most of the kids in your classes ."
premed,fjpc272,t1_fekjlvi,1583546967.0,I’m pre applying stage so I don’t know anything - I understand a thank you note but what is a letter of intent?
premed,fjno6nf,t3_fecmrn,1583511389.0,Yasss you can DO IT! let us know how it goes :)

Biochemistry,fhwbwp9,t1_fhw9u09,1581911641.0,Oh i guess I didn’t think of that . We didn’t have bio homework just exams so it didn’t cross my mind.
Biochemistry,fhw87ff,t1_fhw6htr,1581908814.0,Ah i see . Interesting. I’m not that far into my bio degree and haven’t taken biochem yet so excuse my less than advanced explanation. I will remember this one though for the higher levels!!!
Biochemistry,fhw5eb7,t1_fhvqs3e,1581906803.0,Well this is disappointing. I thought any phosphodiester bond was a condensation reaction?
Biochemistry,fhujg4i,t1_fhui92a,1581887024.0,HAHAHA I was so damn pumped to answer this because it’s the only one I’ve ever been able to answer. Good experience though because I’ve been working on my school confidence - I always answer peoples questions and follow up with “wait actually idk I’m dumb blah blah” and that’s not true!!! So I’ve been trying to be more confident - only if I know I’m right though. 🤔
premed,fhu7ymj,t1_fhu0jcj,1581883101.0,"I really appreciate you taking the time to explain that to me. I understand now how my comment came off as lazy and I do apologize for that. This was a really good starting point for me though, and it does actually answer my question of how can I be a solution and not another part of the problem. I definitely will start my research now and will try to educate others... hopefully that will help a bit. Thanks again for your reply and good luck in school :)"
premed,fhtwtle,t1_fhtwc96,1581879271.0,"Okay, I hear you. I appreciate your feedback"
Biochemistry,fhtvssv,t1_fhtvqj5,1581878832.0,Sure! Hope that explanation was helpful.
Biochemistry,fhtv1ns,t3_f4uqsd,1581878509.0,"Also, no question is stupid. This is foreign stuff! Don’t ever be afraid to ask questions."
Biochemistry,fhtule2,t3_f4uqsd,1581878347.0,"It becomes bonded to the OH group of the 5’ Phosphate group. This is done by a condensation reaction, which means 2 H atoms and 1 O atom (I.e. a water molecule 💧) are created from this bond. We are left with just one O atom! So- the OH group on the carbon 3’ join with the OH on the P group and boom! Water out, you’re left with both molecules bonded by the O. This is how DNA/RNA becomes a big long strand. And remember - this happens in 5’-3’ orientation. Aka carbon 5’s P group kinda clicks in to the bottom of another molecules carbon 3’."
premed,fhts1pl,t1_fhtp34g,1581877526.0,"I’m sorry that this comment made you react like that. It’s not my intention to be annoying or come off as “boohoo I need everyone to like me”. I just think it would be helpful as a white person who wants to be a provider to gain insight from other races, genders, ethnicities, etc. as to how I can accommodate them and make them feel comfortable. I really am racking my brain as to how this is wrong. If you do think this is problematic, please enlighten me. I’m always open to constructive criticism. And yes, I know the obvious answer is don’t judge people and/or make assumptions about them due to color, gender, age, etc. I’m more looking for a dialogue or specific examples."
