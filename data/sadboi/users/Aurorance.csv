customhearthstone,fjx59z6,t1_fjukccm,1583657369.0,U mean this comment?
customhearthstone,fjprozw,t1_fjprget,1583559362.0,"I know but I wont make its tribe as “Murloc & Mech” , thats too dumb. Stop being too serious"
customhearthstone,fjmeo5p,t1_fjmeffg,1583468540.0,I want to make not as not silenceable (which is same as [[Nightmare Amalgam]] that is also using the reminder text)
customhearthstone,fj66i0q,t3_fbq19h,1583059178.0,"Well in many situations you still need a weapon even if you overkill, if doesnt kill a minion then gives you weapon, it doesn’t suit the theme of an assassin"
customhearthstone,fiwmj6g,t1_fiwmfaa,1582792422.0,"After you use skaterbot you only gain 1 mana. But you still have to spend 1 mana for each Snip snap, it is not totally free"
customhearthstone,fiwlp4p,t3_fa8gx6,1582791282.0,"1/3 is better
Too overpowered against aggro hunters"
customhearthstone,fiq4iuf,t1_fiq4dty,1582634851.0,"I think you misunderstood to concept.
2 hp minions minions can still damage this card because that minion hasn’t been damaged by the minion with ignite. Minions cant be ignited if they are not damaged by the minion with ignite before."
customhearthstone,fi3w9tx,t3_f6cbl4,1582128990.0,Maybe 1/1/2
customhearthstone,fi3invj,t3_f6arhn,1582120061.0,"Quite op
Might destroy the meta"
customhearthstone,fhzua56,t1_fhzu8ra,1582012055.0,"But it doesn’t make warrior good enough.
Also the requirements are different"
customhearthstone,fhru7fo,t3_f4n0qm,1581838988.0,So your opponent cant do anything if they don’t have spells with board clear. Then you can attack enemy’s face directly. Thats too op for heroes like hunter. Maybe all gain taunt instead of Freeze.
customhearthstone,fhrqyli,t3_f4muyy,1581835106.0,Hearthcards.net is better
customhearthstone,fhrqx4l,t1_fhrqqpn,1581835061.0,"So if you play this then shudderwock, it triggers the Battlecry (add a battlecry to your hand minion), then trigger the battlecry (draw a card)."
customhearthstone,fhrquys,t3_f48vyu,1581834997.0,This effect will add the Battlecry text directly on the card.
customhearthstone,fhrmpys,t3_f4kxtk,1581830792.0,Too op. So opponent have to discard 3 after using that 9 cost spell?
customhearthstone,fhrmmej,t3_f4laf6,1581830702.0,"Quite decent i think. 2/2/2 is already balanced.
Maybe set it as a priest card is better."
customhearthstone,fhrmgl7,t3_f4lpre,1581830552.0,This is too weak. Excess damage can be dealt to allies. [[Fireball]] or [[Rolling Fireball]] is much better.
customhearthstone,fhrm4yc,t1_fhpe04x,1581830258.0,Yes it’s just like your idea. Windfury is not included in battlecry.
customhearthstone,fhrlusu,t3_f4lyuf,1581830009.0,"It’s hard to balance these 3 weapons. I make it as three kinds of function (1 is cheap with AOE, 1 is for killing big minions, 1 is for killing small minions and gaining armor the same time). I make this because quest warrior is quite weak in this meta."
customhearthstone,fhp1fjm,t1_fhp1c5s,1581779996.0,You mean what happen when a minion with combo gain this battlecry?
customhearthstone,fhopw40,t3_f47dn7,1581769067.0,"If you can help your opponent discover another one, it will be better and more balanced"
customhearthstone,fhopmyi,t3_f48ik8,1581768874.0,"Although I’m a noob at making custom cards, I have some suggestions.
I think there’s no need to explain what Imprison is when you make this as a keyword.
Maybe the effect can be ‘Imprison (8) a minion. ’ Then add that black block to explain what Imprison is (play a card with a specific minimum cost to let the targeted minion gain the ability to attack)
Nice idea tho"
customhearthstone,fho3td8,t1_fho3q2z,1581740547.0,"So I make it shuffled in deck
You have to play it at late game or that minion might not suit the tribe."
customhearthstone,fhl491i,t1_fhl40qk,1581694992.0,"Yes i know
But if I make this as OP as Zephyrs, decks with this 2 cards will be too overpowered too. Therefore I make it weaker than Zephyrs"
customhearthstone,fhkwjwl,t3_f3ql5w,1581692493.0,"It’s really hard to balance these cards since each card has its advantages. I think health kit is the most balanced one while Multifunctional Toolbox and The Punching Hammer are quite controversial. 
For the toolbox, I think this is the best tool for many players because of its hand-shuffling effect. I have thought about making it as 5 cards but after comparing to the 2-cost warlock spell, I make it as 6 cards instead.
For the hammer, Twinspell for 5 damage is quite balanced I think. In decks with no duplicated cards, clearing board effects might not good. If the hammer deals only 4 damage, the spell mostly cast on the same minion in many situations (note that it’s already turn 5).
I want to make the hammer being used on two minions (coz Big Druid is rising this meta).
If i make this card as a Discover effect, it will be too overpowered. Putting it with zephyrs will be too overpowered...
So this is my thoughts on balancing this card (sorry for poor english)"
customhearthstone,fhkvdth,t1_fhkv2hr,1581691906.0,Sometimes hand changer is very useful. I make this by making a reference from Cynthia in PTCG ( a very useful card in that card game). I believe this card is also useful in this game
customhearthstone,fhkpgp0,t1_fhkpahe,1581688738.0,Thanks
customhearthstone,fhkpd2j,t3_f3ql5w,1581688677.0,"I make it as random because Discover might be too op for him (compare with zephyrs). I hope this card can be a supportive card for decks without duplicated cards with three kinds of support (one for managing hand cards, one for heal & draw, and one for controlling the board)."
customhearthstone,fhgv66t,t1_fhgv58n,1581580541.0,"No
It only deals damage to opponent"
customhearthstone,fhgs6kl,t1_fhgs57m,1581576970.0,Yes ik but that card isn’t silence
customhearthstone,fhgs42t,t1_fhgs0f6,1581576892.0,"Th card design suits warriors

customhearthstone,fhdv8a0,t1_fhdv7e1,1581503376.0,Maybe i have to add a bracket (not stackable)
customhearthstone,fhdu23f,t1_fhdrkis,1581501656.0,Yes it will draw 4
