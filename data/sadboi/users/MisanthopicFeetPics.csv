When I was on the misanthrope sub, I met this guy who was really awful and angry. He made me realise how this hateful attitude towards people can be detrimental and damaging in the long run. After that, I started to think ""maybe I don't want to be in this group anymore."" Even before that, though, I was questioning my misanthropy as legitimate or a product of my depression.

Also, my friends, online and irl, are pretty cool people who have not been nearly as angry as I am. Not even close. They make me feel better and I actually feel pretty content when I talk to them, because they're kind people and they help me with the pain indirectly. I thank them every day for it.

Completely understand. My dad is Bipolar and is really abusive. He'll never apologise or even admit to being abusive, but I've met some really amazing people with Bipolar Disorder. The key is finding the right medication, going to therapy, and being in the right environment. That goes for everybody with any disorder.

I've never heard of that one, but there is a disorder that, iirc, isn't widely recognised called ""Sadistic Personality Disorder"" which might be what that guy has. I'm not a doctor, so I can't dx anyone with anything and because I don't know him personally, I can't dx him, but sadistic people derive pleasure from being assholes, torturing, maybe even killing. They might have another disorder that causes this and they might not, but those people are dangerous and you need to watch out for them."

I might not be able to feel the same way people without it don't, but I try my hardest to make sure that I don't cause any harm because I don't want to hurt others. It's just not something I want to do. Empathy isn't the end all be all and we really need to change the dynamics of how we see empathy, compassion, and human relations, because to paint the general Cluster B population (especially the first two) as ""violent criminals"" who are ""dangerous"" to be around is ableist. 

Inb4 anyone says ""that's just you! Most people with it are awful!"" I ask you to please consider this:

You (hopefully) wouldn't say this about other groups of marginalised communities based on what you see in crime shows or what some people might think, so don't say it about anyone else.

In order to have ASPD, you have to go to a therapist and get tested. Clinical Psychopathy is assessed by criminal psychologists or in extreme cases, iirc.

In case anyone is reading this, I am a person with ASPD. I was dxed with it. No, you do not have it just because you enjoy your hatred of humanity and want everyone to die. You're just extremely misanthropic. Nothing ""psycho/sociopathic"" about it."

Like you, I've also been pro human extinction for years (I had an entire blog dedicated to it before the outbreak) and this pandemic doesn't sadden me at all. It doesn't make me want to tap dance on mass graves or anything, but to be sad about something none of us can control is pointless.
