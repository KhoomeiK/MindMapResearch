Everywhere I checked (including the most recent archive here) doesn’t have the file, has some crazy ad spam I can’t get past, or has the .3ds file that when I convert it to .cia, it gives me a black screen when I go to play it. I also looked up the game in the search here to see if anyone else found it and the links I’ve found don’t work anymore. I was able to get the Japanese version up and working but I don’t understand Japanese and it’s doesn’t have an English version (I tried using Luma Locale Switcher). The Europe versions I found don’t work despite my 3DS already able to play region free games. I dunno if it’s because of that or somehow the .3ds file messes up when I convert it to .cia. 

I’m just wondering if anyone is able to help me get the .cia file of Rhythm Heaven Megamix (US)? I’m playing on my homebrewed 3DS."

I acknowledge I was a fool for going to my number one (most expensive) college on my list, but I was constantly encouraged to go under the promise that I’d not have to worry about money at all because of my gender, heritage and good grades. My family still says that I didn’t try hard enough. Trying to pay for college using only scholarships is like trying to pay rent using only scratch tickets.

I was really young too so some of this was fuzzy but basically my great grandma (I think she was like 85) had a neighbor named Tony I think. We all lived in this apartment and I guess he was one of those guys who wanted her inheritance and shit and it was just in general a really weird fucking situation. He was a scam artist and no matter how many times my grandmother fought with her over it my nana (great grandma) wouldn’t listen.

My nana was just batshit wild honestly. She kicked my grandfather out and she literally punched him in the face (at 85 mind you) and bro it was just wild. The day we moved out my grandmother had a fight with the boyfriend and she went inside with a butter knife and threw it at him. He ended up leaving finally after my dad literally came to town to beat his ass. After that my nana started getting severe dementia and ended up forgetting about him. 

Honestly my nana wasn’t really a good person. She was very manipulative and as a result when she was in a nursing home only me and my father was the only ones who wanted to be with her. My grandparents had both died when I was 15 so me and my dad was the only family she had left.

Apparently one of her sons even faked his own death so he wouldn’t have to deal with her. Djdjdjd I don’t know the entire shit is crazy. As fucked up the entire situation was I can’t help but find it a tiny bit funny because of how batshit insane it is.

From what I remember of Tony though he was usually always over asking for money and shit. He was a bit cool to me though, he took me trick or treating once.

I absolutely adore my father even though he’s a tiny bit of a narc, but he’s mainly an enabler for my narc step mother. I love them both regardless. But as most are, when I’m around them I’m reserved, quiet, don’t do anything or talk about myself or my personal life.

Onetime I went to an interview and something absolutely stuck with me. It was at my dad’s job, and everyone knows my dad there because he’s the manager. I went in, doing interviews how I always usually do, acting how I usually act around other people- outgoing, respectful, happy, making jokes, etc. They loved me, but what really got to me was what the interviewer said. He said that he was pleasantly surprised by how I acted: my dad had told them I was a very shy timid girl. They probably thought I was a different daughter or something.

It broke my heart because that’s absolutely not how I am at all... that’s only how I am at my parent’s house. When I’m with my parents/living with them I act like nothing more than a shy timid little girl despite being 22. It broke my heart. Even now that I live on my own I don’t think I even know how to be myself around my parents. It’s as abstract as imagining a new color."

I think the big issue here is that well New York is one of the biggest populated states here in the country. The population is very disproportionate compared to states that have a smaller population as well as communities that are far apart. Like in the mid west some people have to drive a half an hour just to go to the store.

But New York is downright insane right now because of how crowded it is. It’s crowded and full of people. I grew up there and it was impossible to not come in contact with anyone, especially since everyone’s living in apartments, some families of five in a single apartment, who are constantly in public transportation every single day. New York is basically a septic tank right now. There’s so many people there, there’s even people who live in Boston and commute to work in New York.

So my little sister just found out that her dad isn’t her biological dad and that she has an older sister and biological father out there.

That, with all the lies she was told, my little sister is afraid of my father and wants nothing to do with him. Because she’s a minor I can’t try to contact her myself. As a result, I just have to hope maybe one day she’ll come around and want to talk to me herself. I’ve been told this’ll probably happen in her 20s. She’s 15.

It breaks my heart everyday. I want to be that cool older sister so bad. I want to spoil the hell out of her. I was told she’s very similar to me and we share the same interests which break my heart even more. 

As for the second part, I’m my biological mom’s youngest child, and I’m my dad’s first child. I have two step sisters, one older and one younger in my dad’s family, so I’m also a middle child.

For most of my life I was raised as an only child under my grandparents. So I kinda have a lot of experiences with a lot of different things lmao. Some of my family act shocked that I have CPTSD and major depression, but it’s whatever. Now I’m tryna do my best to live my own life. I just hope one day I can meet my little sister and be there for her."

I’m already in shambles because my old school forced me to drop out even though I have a 3.7 GPA. I couldn’t afford to go there so they told me to leave and come back when I can afford it. (Which is dumb because I have to start paying back my federal loans)

Anyway, I’m tired. I almost had to stop going to therapy and psychiatry which I desperately need because my insurance (which is the best in the whole state apparently) doubled their copays. Thankfully my college has free services for that but it’s still wtf.

I’m just tried, honestly."

Also I didn’t move out until October 2019 so I wasn’t on my own for most of the year. Sadly I won’t qualify for this stimulus even though I might be loosing my job because of this dumb virus and unemployment only pays half of my wage. Because I’m in college my college doesn’t allow anyone to work more than 20 in the school."
Coronavirus,flq3n97,t1_floq9yq,1585377832.0,"Yup. I’m one of those fucked students. I’m loosing my foodstamps in the middle of this pandemic because my state isn’t apart of some federal exception, and I’m going to potentially loose my job at school, and I won’t be paid at all if I don’t work. And ontop of all that I can’t get this stimulus because my parents claim me as dependent even though I don’t live at home at all and I’m on my own.

I told my landlord all this that has been going on. And he told me that he can’t do anything to help me when it comes to rent. He sent me a text the other day telling me to use the government money for rent. 

Ontop of that, filing for unemployment will still not help me. Unemployment pays half of what you make, and at my school you’re only allowed to work 20 a week. Because of this I’ll be getting paid for 10 hours each week. That’s only around $440 a month. To pay for rent. And food."

My dad drilled that into my head. I know obviously he didn’t mean it for that, but I still can’t help but feel reserved talking about what happened with me when I know there’s others who had it way worse. I also feel like the other abuse and neglect that I experienced from my biological mother left me off way worse but it still doesn’t make anything okay.

I still want to kill myself. I just doing see the point in anything anymore or why I should bother going through all this bullshit. I think what kills me the most is probably the fact that there are people out there who are suffering horrible things... i cant live in a world where such evil happens."

AmItheAsshole,ficysge,t1_fici5ls,1582359760.0,"OP saying no (or even asking to speak in private) would’ve been a disaster. Multiple people were recording. Had he said no during the proposal, literally the entire class would see the girl have her entire hopes crushed and her probably having a breakdown on camera, which I guarantee you the video of her humiliation in front of the entire class would be tossed around online and in school. That would also lead her to being bullied for said rejection, and for being humiliated. Even if he asked to speak to her in private, I highly doubt her entourage would allow that without having an answer either. Even if he managed to do so, the video is still being recorded."
AmItheAsshole,ficy3k9,t1_ficmn3t,1582359488.0,"What was OP supposed to do though? Imagine being in high school, with all eyes on you. People were literally video taping him, for Christ’s sakes. His entire class and teacher are clapping and cheering for the girl being paraded around with an entire entourage of people. Imagine how horrible it would’ve been for him to say no, and both OP and the girl being so humiliated because of it. OP would be bullied for being an ‘asshole’ (which he’s not) and the girl would probably be bullied for being rejected so publicly. And I can guarantee you the video would have gone viral in their school.

You have a disabled sister, right? Just think of it this way; would you rather her be devastated over having her initial promposal being accepted and then rejected in private? Her just crying over being rejected even though she was initially accepted? Or would you rather have her not want to go to school ever again because she was not only rejected anyways, but there’s also a video of said rejection online downright humiliating her in front of her entire class, with people also bulling her online and in school over the said video that’s never, ever going to go away. And I can guarantee that video would’ve been passed around throughout the entire school. Kids are cruel.

That was literally the only way OP could’ve handled it. (Unless of course he chose to go, but that’s downright unfair to him that he’d have to have a miserable night. Needless to say, it would’ve been obvious to the girl that he didn’t want to be there, which could also cause her crying and wanting to leave in the middle of prom because of it.)"
AmItheAsshole,ficx3ir,t1_ficrfl9,1582358741.0,"Yes but OP would have to sacrifice his own happiness? Going to a prom with someone you barely even hang out with/like is a shitty experience. He would’ve had a miserable night. 

On top of that, what about his crush? His crush from what he’s saying likes her back. For all we know, she could literally have no one else to go with to prom, so she might end up not having a happy prom either."

Basically the entire game just save me in multiple reasons. It connected me to the world of gaming and provided me ways to connect to my grandparents who were raising me. I was bullied mercilessly as a kid so the characters in the game were my friends. 

Now that my grandparents are dead, the game basically kinda acts like a pathway to the happiness I had as a kid. The game taught me the value of friendship, and that no matter what there’s always a light in the darkness. I’ve been having severe depression for the past five years and honestly if it wasn’t for KH I wouldn’t be here."
AskReddit,fi7fwhu,t3_f6qlck,1582220612.0,"Hurt by Christina Aguilera. I was sobbing after I heard that song for the first time back when it first came out as a kid. Even now at 22 I can’t even think of it without crying.

I’m a huge daddy’s little girl. I love my father(and grandfather who was basically my father) and of course there has been a lot of issues between us. Moreso with me and my father. All I want to do is be a good daughter and make them proud. Now that my grandfather is dead my dad is all I have left, and our relationship is strained because of my step mom. I cry often just wishing it could be simple back when I was a little girl... but now I’m grown up I have to be on my own.

A part that exceptionally hurts me is how in the song Christina sings about wanting her father to hold her, or about how she wants to call him but she knows he won’t be picking up if she does. (I don’t know if her actual father is dead but in the song that she’s singing about.)

Just thinking about it makes me cry. How badly I want to call my grandfather.... how badly I want to apologize and hug him... but I can’t do that. No matter how many times I call his number he won’t pick up because he’s gone. 

When I was in 7th grade, my grandfather was still alive but I literally had to talk to my teachers because I would burst into tears at the mere thought of my grandfather dying. Now it’s like that but with my father. 90% of the mother figures of my life has been horrible to me so I’m even more attached to my father now that my grandfather is dead.

God.... just that song... I don’t think I’ll ever in my life find a song that will break me more than Hurt does."
