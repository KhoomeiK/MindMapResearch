depression,ewlbfca,t3_cml6ni,1565515491.0,I fr hate myself sm and I can't sleep. It takes me like 30 min to an hour to sleep. And it's so hard to wake up. And if I don't cut its harder to sleep. I just wanna die so bad. I can't cry. I can't really feel anything except just sadness. And suicidal ideation gmfu. Suicide is ALWAYS on my mind. But it ain't nothin but a thang:)
depression,ew4t070,t3_cmka7s,1565117669.0,If I had taken one more pill than I did when I OD'd I wouldn't be here. I really wish I had taken that one extra pill
depression,ew4su5h,t3_cmcier,1565117568.0,"Yeah, my dad just says, ""get up and start the day and you won't be sad."" And, ""Well, if you start the day w a workout then you'll be happy bc of endorphins."" I don't think he understands how draining depression actually is. Like I don't want to get up. I don't even want to be alive"
