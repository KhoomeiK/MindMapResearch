I was sleeping when the pressure of a metal bottle caused it to pop in the other end of the room startling me.

I remember my entire body twitching in shock before i even processed that i had heard the sound. Almost like i reacted and then afterwards heard what had happened.

The body reacts much faster to sonud than it does to  light. So if an explosion goes off close to you, your body will already have reacted to the sound by the time you have proccessed the bright lights.

Besides if you factor in the speed of sound and light it has everything to do with distance to the object.

Any light from any object that you see on earth pretty much hits your eye instantly, where as if you look at an explosion from across town it can take the soundwave 2 seconds to hit you."

Success in SR is not abstaining for 1000 days in a row. Success is any relationship towards sex and orgasms that are healthier than what you were used to.

Going from masturbating 10 times a week to 2 times a week is success.

Realizing that your energy is largely determined by your retention is a HUGE leap of knowledge and is considered a success even if you continue to masturbate.

Anyone who gives SR a shot is succeeding more than he were before he did so.

Running a marathon can be a spiritual event because you are pushed to the boundaries of your physical body, and this energy perhaps provides new perspectives.

Spirituality from semen retention likely stems from the new found energy, and the persons approach to the problem.

Retention invokes an already existing, searching, spirituality. It does not create it out of thin air.

&#x200B;

Much like psychedelics; A truly non spiritual person can have a fun time on psychedelics, ""wow pretty colors, cool"" and have it never go further than that.

A person just slightly ready to ask questions will have a profound spiritual experience on even a low dose of psychedelics.

The man who supresses himself is not truly chaste. He is prisoned by his supression. A truly chaste man knows sex from the core of his being, and does not work to supress or indulge it. All these rules and statements about sex are the same chains as those who are addicted to it.

Thinking about sex in lust or in disgust is ultimately the same. Thinking that you should not be thinknig about sex is not different from thinking about it. It is all a mechanism of the mind.

The  brahmachari  are as controlled by sex as the lustful addicts, because they spend all their energy either supressing or indulging. This is not chaste or pure. Sex is not a pure or an impure thing and the minds desire to label it is where the problem arises in the first place.

Semenretention,fpcak5l,t1_fpcafgc,1588493343.0,"I think this post is wonderful, but I also projected my insecurity. I would be so scared that she would do this.
How do you handle that thought? Or how do you not have that thought in the first place? My partners have been very sex oriented and wouldn’t handle my celibacy well."
Semenretention,fpca9kp,t1_fpbw19h,1588493041.0,I liked your way of speaking
Semenretention,fpca4zt,t1_fpauede,1588492910.0,I merely said that because he said he went from 5/10 to 3/10 and I thought that was too harsh in himself.
Semenretention,fpal3qt,t1_fpakl8t,1588450396.0,"This depends on your intent I think.

Just like when masturbating, if you get really close to climaxing but stop right at the edge (edging) then you are shooting yourself in the foot.

People say that there is a way to indulge sexually without these effects but I have yet to try and experience it. 
Look up karezza and tantra sex.

Ejaculating will ultimately always drain you spiritually and literally. But perhaps there is a healthy moderation to this.

When you cum, the sex is over and you no longer have passion for your woman and she will feel this.
If you don’t cum the sex may end when you both feel it is right to end and you should both be satisfied."

If you’re malnutritioned from going vegan you were already malnutritioned before lol."

Semenretention,fpajev7,t3_gcbvrs,1588449408.0,"Because you released energy!
Releasing energy only feels good if having energy feels bad (negative thought, pain, etc.)

Releasing good energy sucks because all your drive and happiness went down the drain.

Releasing bad energy feels good because it gives you a moment of peace. But it also entices more bad energy.

Don’t release your good OR your bad energy, Learn to master it!

I had a crazy binge relapse and I am so happy that it happened 4 days ago because I am finally starting to feel my energy again. I went for a run and I cooked dinner today. Last 4 days have been frozen pizza and lethargy."
Semenretention,fpaiofw,t3_gcb39d,1588448975.0,"So here’s the thing about drugs yea? They teach you shit, they open you up to new perspectives, but after that they only serve to hold you down.

First time I drank alcohol all my inhibitions lowered and I learned to not be such an uptight asshole all the time. Ever since then, alcohol just makes me stupid and feel bad,, makes me say and do stupid shit.

Weed had the same effect. I changed completely after smoking weed, and I’m happy for it. But since then I got so addicted that it started to control my life and I got lost in anxiety and insecurity.

Amphetamine taught me that just because I don’t find something interesting, it doesn’t mean that it isn’t. It taught me that there is value to every human being on the planet, even my enemies. But if I took it every time I went out you can imagine the effects it would have on me.

Psychedelics are a truly mind opening experience, but I have seen my close friends develop a spiritual ego the size of a solar system (literally lol) and become borderline unbearable to be around.

Coke didn’t teach me jack shit fuck coke.

MDMA taught me that there is love in all of the universe, but it has also made me completely unable to feel it. Seriously don’t fuck with mdma. This shit will show you the other side of existence, the side of the world that is filled with fear and pain and suffering.

Caffeine made me productive as hell, but it takes all of that productivity from you and lures you with the promise that if you just take more caffeine it will come back. It won’t.

Sex and masterbation and even porn taught me about my sexuality, but after that it is something I need to explore with another human being, not with addictive pixels.


It seems like you are asking which crutch you should hold on to if you cant take drugs and abuse sex etc.
Hold on to your friends and family bro. Try everything but be fucking aware that these drugs only teach you lessons ONCE. After that they serve to ruin you.

I’ve been fucking around and now my life only revolves around escaping from these crutches and try and live a normal fucking life. I’m 23 years old."

But your experience of SR is your own, and other people will have a different experience. None of them are the correct way to experience them.
Even the schizophrenic guy that wanders these threads with crazy stories are speaking truths from his heart, and his stories hold value."
Semenretention,fpa59kk,t1_fpa3gqu,1588441083.0,"I don’t know. Ask your partner why you can’t be together without having sex.
Having a partner who share that view is not impossible but they are rare, and what do you do if the love of your life does not want a life without sex?

We love a lot of people throughout our lives without having sex, but there are also relationships where sex is an essential part of it."
