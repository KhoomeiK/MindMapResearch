Example: It's illegal to steal wages from your workers. You can't legally do this by taking money from them for say, produce they accidentally destroy. But you *can* do this by making employees buy their uniforms, even if those uniforms *must* be purchased *from* the employer for greater than their cost to produce.

They're both wage theft, but the latter is just allowed via a loophole that's been created. It's still an employer forcing an employee to give their wages back.

Another classic example was coal mining towns. The ye old company store. The company owns the mines, and the only store where employees can work. They set prices at the store to force employees into debt they must work off. This continued for decades until the laws regarding wage theft, monopolies, and labor laws, were revised. But it shouldn't take congressional action to understand how wrong that is. Hundreds of court cases regarding these practices were brought forward, and hundreds of times they were struck down because the letter of the law allowed ""wage slavery"".

Because some people see the ""Well regulated militia"" part as authority to regulate weaponry. Others ignore it entirely. Which is why we have the SCOTUS to interpret the spirit of the law. To determine what they mean by ""bear arms"" what is the cut off? Because it could be viewed such that biological and nuclear weapons should be 100% legal without any regulation whatsoever.

The main reason for this is because there were much bigger events going on with far more impact around the same time period.

The most dramatic of which was the Mongols were invading from the East. Compared to the Mongols, the crusades were insignificant. In fact it's arguable the only reason the crusades even had the few measures of success they had was because the Muslim armies were off trying to stop the invading horde.

Especially after the peasant crusade, the Muslims basically viewed the militaries of Europe as bumbling idiots for a time.

Yes, the east-west tug of war is basically just western propaganda from relatively recent times. Christians and Muslims used to declare holy wars on basically everyone. It was an easy way to gain legitimacy for your campaign, even if the people you were attacking were the same religion. Throughout thr crusades and the following centuries, Christians and Muslims were as likely to ally with each other as against. In fact, the King of Norman Sicily was so closely tied with Fatimid Egypt that when the pope called on him to attack them for a crusade his response was to, fart and burp and say that made more sense than what the pope was asking.

One of my professors is a historian from Jordan, according to them, the crusades are tought in the muslim world as generally the beginning of European attempts at colonialism.

Good sources for this information, can be found in:

If this PVP is intended as an end to the campaign and a dramatic finish then I think it's fine.

Running this mid mission expecting everyone to come back with new characters etc after half the party just killed the other half is silly yeah, but order 66 feels like a pretty natural conclusion to a clonewars story."
swrpg,fqhzme1,t1_fpv82rs,1589387324.0,"That's no fun lol

My first game I was constantly skimming credits off the party. Did it in plain sight too, they'd just forget and we'd move on. It came up like 3 times and just got forgotten again.

Finally they remembered and meta'd enough to catch me with my second credit chit. So I showed them my books, I'd been stealing money, the GM knew, I'd even kept a log of everything I spent the stolen credits on, it was purely spenr for the party as a whole, but they never would have agreed to give up the credits in character so I made due.

In a clone wars campaign, with Jedi and Clones in the party, unless there has been some other established information, any player can only assume that order 66 is a natural end point, with some PVP to wrap things up. 

If it's a dramatic conclusion it's fine IMHO. If it's like the middle of the campaign and you're gonna have them make new characters when they murder each other in PVP, then yeah, it's a problem. 

Secrets in the party are fine as long as you have a group who isn't going to take it personally. It's a story, your friend didn't just *actually* try to kill you and the campaign is ending anyways because this is the logical end. Start new campaign."

They might have been fine the first few tests, but that fail caught them off guard and now they can't focus on the exam because the pressure is so much higher.

Hell, one of the smartest guys in my ALS class was a fire fighter and regularly had to keep his cool in an emergency. Put him in front of a test and he fell to pieces, he ended up failing the final exam and having to retake it.

Frankly, when it comes to standardized testing the military should know the crop its harvesting from and act accordingly. Better preparation to deal with test anxiety etc."

When I was in the USAF we had a reserve unit from North Carolina come and help us out. One day this guy, (barely 18, might be relevant that he was black idk) that we've been working with for like 3 months, finds out I'm Jewish. He goes *NUTS*, like he just learned that his favorite celebrity was in the building. He had a million questions, asked ""Do you have the hat thing?"" Which I did, I couldn't wear my issued one at work for safety reasons but I kept it on me and showed him. He got so excited he couldn't think of any more questions.

The next day he comes running up to me, ""Hey! xxkoloblicinxx! I called my mom and told her I met a Jewish person! She had some questions too!"" He literally pulled out a *list*. We spent a bit while we worked and on lunch talking and me answering his questions that ranged from the usual stuff, bar/bat mitzvahs, circumcision, etc. To the outlandish stuff like ""You guys aren't really shapeshifters like on Borat right? Okay, just checkin.""

It was nice and a good reminder of how people can and should act when meeting people who are different."

AskReddit,fqa6fdf,t3_ghmbxg,1589213647.0,"Do your best to *stay calm*. 

It's hard, after all the other person is trying to whoop your ass and since you're fighting you're probably right pissed off.

But just take a deep breath, collect yourself, and mentally prepare for what's about to happen.

Even for a complete novice, the difference between staying calm and not is the difference between a solid jab or punch and just flailing wildly. Also, basic human anatomy teaches you all the soft spots and it's a lot easier to aim for and hit them if you're not just blind rage swinging fists.

A list of targets, right behind the ear, solarplexes, kidneys (lower back to each side), and in a worst case scenario, life or death situation, the human ear can be ripped off with about 5lbs of torque. Ain't nobody gonna keep fighting after you rip their ear off, if they do, you shoulda ran. 

also helpful tip, if someone has you by the throat, prying their hands off is hard. Prying each individual finger off is easy. *Break them* as you do. This person is trying to choke you to death, all bets are off. Bonus once they let go that hand won't be much helo throwing a punch.

But it will be almost impossible to remember these tips if you're panicking and the only thought in your head is ""oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.""

edit: But this is all assuming you *have* to fight for some reason. Defending your life or someone elses etc. Fighting should be avoided, and staying calm will certainly help. More than once myself or a buddy has been decked by someone trying to fight and the proper reaction is to look at them like they're fucking stupid and walk away."

Put simply, from childhood to adulthood their relationship was just weird. Not quite a business transaction, but also not really what I would describe as ""loving.""

It also doesn't help that my mom has a clear ""type"" even to this day, if a man isn't *at least* 15years older he's not attractive to her. Which is fine I guess, but I always figured physical attraction wasn't enough to build a relationship on.  I guess the kink is just that strong."

I agree, it's weird, and fucking gross. Even growing up and being taught to accept people's decisions for their own lives, gay marriage, trans, etc. It was fucking weird.

Like, my mom's best friend since grade school is engaged to my step-brother and they're only 3 years apart. Her kids from her first marriage that I grew up with are going to be my nephews.

It's their choice, my mom and step-dad are... happy-ish? I guess after 20+ years of marriage. But honestly, I've never been able to understand what the attraction is. They have so little in common, I've hardly ever seen anything that could be described as chemistry between them. But my mom apparently has a thing for older men, and he apparently has a thing for younger women and that's enough?

Hell I can't even call my mom a gold digger because she turned down a much richer man for him."
