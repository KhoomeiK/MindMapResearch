Later on I realized that a big issue for me is that like you, I don't want to/don't have the motivation to get better. That can be changed, and medication isn't the only option to treat depression. I've found group therapy helpful at times, as it can be a good way to hear how others are doing and what they've done to get better, or maybe someone in group could offer advice. Getting better is going to be a tough, long road, but as I said above, it's not too late to start that ""journey"". I always tell myself, one step at a time. Getting better takes time and maybe you're just not at that point yet. That doesn't mean it'll never happen though."

Even if they were more severe, we're all worthy of redemption and have the ability to change our actions in the future.

A school counselor **may** be able to help you find a professional to talk to since I don't think they would be qualified to diagnose you themselves. 

Another option (given that they may find out anyway) is to just directly ask your parents to see someone about what you've been going through lately. Even if you were able to get a doctor's appointment scheduled and have everything worked out, a parent usually needs to be present if you're a minor.

* going to bed at the same time every night
* avoiding caffeine, alcohol and smoking before bedtime

Melatonin is also an option if you need a medication for sleep aid and can be found without a prescription in most places.

As far as punching yourself, it could be unintentional self harm, though I think it's best to bring that up with a doctor or therapist, as I honestly am not sure. The amount of time you do it and for how hard is also a factor to bring up as well."

I think getting a therapist would be a good step after that, to help you work through your thoughts, etc. As for actually opening up, maybe try opening up to a friend first and possibly going to your parents together so they can realize that it isn't just all in your head and that it's affecting your schoolwork and that other people (your friends, teachers, etc.) are noticing as well. It probably will be a tough conversation, but ultimately necessary if you want to get the help you need.

depression,fqfbu1c,t3_gijc5b,1589322135.0,"You're not insane for wanting to go back. I felt the same way after coming home from the hospital. It makes sense. The hospital is a safe place in which people help you deal with your mental health and it's usually a place to also distract you from what you're going through on the outside world. You can also make connections with other patients which is another bonus. Whether you need to go back depends on how you're feeling. My general rule of thumb is if I do not feel like I can keep myself safe and that I am a threat to myself, that it's best to reach out to my family and go to get evaluated.

My suggestion for now (if you do not need to be hospitalized but still feel overwhelming feelings of sadness, feeling like you want to go back to the hospital, etc.), maybe try PHP (partial hospitalization program) if you need a higher level of care but not quite inpatient or try a group for either CBT or DBT.

There's an entire section for emotion regulation and it can really help with controlling your anger. There's other sections as well that can be helpful with BPD in general. 

Sometimes it can take awhile to find a DBT therapist so some things to work on now could be trying to think about the consequences of acting out when you're angry, or when you feel it start to build up try to unleash it in a healthier way like playing sports or going for a walk. Another trick to calm down quick is to hold an ice cube and squeeze it as hard as you want and just feel it melt in your hands. Sometimes that cools off your brain and slows down your thoughts."

You could also browse through some of the threads here to get a glimpse into what it's like to have BPD, though some may be a bit closer to the extreme end, not necessarily what we go through on a daily basis.

Everyone experiences BPD a bit differently as there are symptoms that some people don't have, etc. and therefore I think it would be a good idea to have a chat about what she is going through and how you would best be able to help her.

Even with a list of symptoms, everyone experiences BPD a little bit differently and it's best to talk to a professional who is well equipped to give you advice, etc.

In terms of how to treat BPD, it would be a somewhat similar treatment to what you may have been going through since you deal with depression and anxiety - **DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy)**. Even if it turns out that you don't have BPD, DBT is going to be good with helping your depression and anxiety as well as suicidal ideation, etc., as those are all things it's intended for. 

If you need any more advice or have questions, feel free to ask away. It can be a bit confusing what to do with a possible diagnosis, treatment, etc."

In terms of controlling anger, the emotion regulation section of DBT might be helpful, as it provides skills and different ways to control negative emotions, especially anger and self harm urges. Maybe start with trying to express to others (or just acknowledging) when you are upset/angry in a healthy way and work up from there. To control it, maybe try and think about the consequences of an outburst might be or how you could affect other people. Additionally, you could try using your anger in a more productive way like cleaning the house, painting or playing a sport. Overall, there's a lot of ways that you can control anger and it would probably be a good thing to bring up with your therapist, especially if you're not already working on DBT."

From there you'll be connected to a licensed counselor who should be able to help you with these urges. For now maybe try something like clenching your fists or bouncing/squeezing a stress ball. Distraction sometimes helps me as well such as going for a walk or taking a moment to focus on other people or cleaning the house, etc. DBT would also be useful, as it has a lot of skills that can be used when dealing with self harm.

No trigger and nothing seems to help so I just let my depression take over. These feelings and outbursts are something to bring up to your therapist, as they're more equipped to help, but I'll give you some coping skills below as well that involve both CBT and DBT (though DBT may be a bit more helpful in your case since it has skills for these exact situation, but a combination of both therapies can work even better).

**In terms of coping skills and how to prevent these actions before they begin or how to stop them in the moment, DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy), especially the emotion regulation module can be helpful. A good skill when you're feeling angry (though hard to practice) is to ride the wave. Even if these feelings of anger do come up out of nowhere, try to realize what the consequences could be if you act on them and try to control yourself and wait for the feelings to pass. You can clench your fists really tight or squeeze an ice cube until it melts while you wait for the anger to pass.**

CBT (cognitive behavior therapy) can also be helpful in preventing the outbursts by realizing how your thoughts and feelings impact your behavior ie having negative feelings and/or anger build up throughout the day before an outburst without realizing it."
BPD,fosl8r2,t3_g9bivx,1588032925.0,"I do not have PMDD though I would always get hospitalized a few days to a week before my period because my suicidal thoughts, self harm urges and just depression in general would get **so** much worse during the time leading up to my period **every month**. 

What I'm currently doing now is helping, though it's not for everyone. I am on birth control for all 30 days out of the month to help lessen my mood swings by lessening my period. Some months I don't have a period, others it's not nearly as much blood and even if I do have symptoms the week before, they aren't as bad. I understand that's not an ideal option for everyone. 

My doctor also suggested tracking my period and taking a pill (an antidepressant I believe or something similar?) for the week or so leading up to my period. I did not go that route since I was already on birth control to help with possibly hormonal acne but that is another option as well.

I hope things do get better and that your PMDD is able to be managed, I know that it's a really tough thing to deal with, especially when in combination with BPD."

BPD,foqjw1k,t3_g8twwl,1587995203.0,"I recently finished having ECT treatments in December that consisted of a little over 50 treatments total in an 8(ish) month time period. I suffer from severe depression and at the time I wasn't diagnosed with BPD yet. Honestly, at the time I do think it helped me and may have saved my life given how severely depressed I was, but as u/Mmadchef808 said, it's certainly not for everyone. It can have other side effects. Other than memory loss (which I mention below), I also was extremely paranoid during that time period.

In most cases I believe it requires anesthesia, muscle relaxers to help lessen the pain when you wake up (your muscles contract during the induced seizure, etc.) and other protective medications. I too did have my memory affected from the treatments and it still is not all that great, especially my long-term memory. Something to think about, however the treatment affects everyone differently. You won't really know how it affects you until you've tried it.

It's definitely something to bring up with your doctor/treatment team, but I'd strongly suggest doing your research on the treatment before, just to make sure you'r'e sure it's the best option. Additionally, for me the treatment helped while I was undergoing it, however every time I was tapered down to twice a week or every other week, I got worse. It's a long process that can cause a lot of side effects, but it may be something that saves your life."

In terms of both stopping snacking and losing some excess weight, what has really helped me (I've lost about 15 lbs so far by doing this method) is creating a food log. The day or night before, write out exactly what you're going to eat for each of your meals, preferably healthy or low calorie things if you're trying to lose weight. Also write what you're going to have for snacks, but limit yourself to only two or three snacks per day rather than eating mindlessly throughout the day. It can be hard at first limiting yourself and eating healthy, but this is the best way I've found so far. Hope it helps! :)"

Another thing that helps me with my boredom is to be (somewhat) social. I have social anxiety , but things like watching a movie being livestreamed and chatting with others can be fun. You both get to enjoy a movie and talk to others without the pressure of being in person. Lastly, my number one recommendation and what has helped me most to deal with boredom is creating and putting in place a routine. It doesn't have to be strict at first, but even following a food plan or diet, implementing exercise and making time to care for yourself (shower, brush your teeth, shave, etc.) really helps and makes you feel better about yourself as well."

Some therapists aren't trained to deal with more severe mental illnesses such as BPD and maybe that could be one reason you're being turned away? Maybe you can reach out to your college counseling center and ask for some assistance in finding a new therapist or ask if they have any recommendations of therapists who deal with patients with BPD. 

Sorry to hear that you're really down today. As another user suggested, a walk or doing some light physical activity can help get your mind off things. Another suggestion is to reach out to friends and family and try to get your mind off things that way. 

Hope you're able to find a therapist soon and that things start looking up soon!"
BPD,fo8nfg4,t3_g69tie,1587600008.0,"I'd say your best option to start with is bringing up your concerns with your doctor. It's scary at first, but it's the first step of getting help. If you do have a lot of the symptoms of BPD, they'll be able to definitively give you a diagnosis, whether that's BPD, another mental illness or nothing at all or refer you to a psychiatrist who's able to give you that information.

If you do have BPD, the best and most recommended treatment is DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) which is a skill-based therapy with different modules including emotion regulation, mindfulness and others. It takes a lot of work and practice, however it's typically very helpful for those of us with BPD. In terms of what coping skills to use, it's hard to recommend any without knowing what symptoms you're dealing with. 

I wouldn't worry yourself too much right now without being diagnosed and knowing what exactly you're dealing with, but even practicing things like mindfulness, journaling, trying to exercise or make a daily routine can help calm things down before you're able to meet with a therapist."
BPD,fo8m6mw,t3_g6b4dm,1587599290.0,"I'm bored as well while still under quarantine so sure, I'll answer some questions! :)

&#x200B;

 **What is your biggest hurdle or issue regarding bpd. (Ex..paranoia, abandonment )**

For me, the biggest hurdle has been impulsivity and extreme mood swings, usually surrounding anger or depression.

**What has helped you the most since your diagnosis ?**

I was just diagnosed a few months ago but what's helped most for me has been knowing that I'm not alone (things like DBT group therapy and even reading posts here on Reddit), therapy (though I've been in therapy for a long time before being diagnosed with BPD) and just believing in myself. Taking the steps to actually get off the couch and go for a walk or journal about how I'm feeling have really helped.

**What therapy has helped you ?**

I've done both CBT and DBT in the past and am taking another shot at DBT and I'd say in terms of helping with BPD, a combination of both. I know DBT is usually the main form of therapy for people with BPD, but seeing how your thoughts, feelings and behaviours are connected (CBT) is actually really useful as well. 

**Have you been diagnosed with more than one co occurring disorder?**

I have also been diagnosed with social anxiety and treatment-resistant depression (TRD) quite awhile before I was diagnosed with BPD.

**If you could choose, would you want a therapist who’s recovered from bpd ? Or someone without**

I haven't actually thought about it, but having a therapist who has recovered from BPD would probably be a lot more helpful than someone who hasn't experienced the symptoms first hand and I think they might be able to give a lot more insight into what helped them in specific situations that we both have gone through.

**What helps you learn the most..books, audio, video, or other?**

I get bored with books to be honest. To really get a good understanding, actually doing something or practicing the skill is when I'm able to learn the best.

**Have you ever learned about family systems?**

No, I have never heard about family systems before.

&#x200B;

I'm glad to hear that a lot of people with BPD have been accepting and understanding towards you, which is sometimes hard to comeby, especially as someone with BPD that deals with very intense symptoms that not everyone understands. I agree, shared experiences definitely seem to help form bonds and connect people and people who have gone through similar things are able to relate better as well. Hope you're having a good day as well, or at least coping for the time being!"
BPD,fo7u2fm,t3_g66tb3,1587584553.0,"It's hard to find a good psychiatrist, but I'll give you the best advice I can. If you're already in therapy, it's a good idea to ask for a list of psychiatrists your therapist or their agency typically refer people to and to and even discuss looking for a psychiatrist with your therapist. I'm sure they'd be more than happy to help. In terms of dealing with psychiatrists being sexist or stigmatizing patients with BPD, maybe try to bring up that you're looking for a psychiatrist and ask people you know for recommendations or look for psychiatrists that specifically treat people with BPD."
BPD,fo3gti4,t1_fo3azid,1587486660.0,"Not a silly question at all. It depends on the therapist. To my knowledge, most therapists have their patient's best interest at heart. If they realize their methods aren't working, I do think they would try to bring it up with you and come up with a different way to help if they can, or like you said, refer you to a professional who has more knowledge. In terms of them just sitting back and collecting money, that can happen as well with some therapists unfortunately. 

Either way, I think it's very important that if you don't feel like you're getting the help and support you need at these sessions to bring it up with your therapist and hopefully they'll be able to help you in the best way possible."
BPD,fo2u8bo,t3_g5ab4z,1587474214.0,"CBT is more about how your thoughts, feelings and actions are linked and is mainly used for depression and anxiety as well as phobias. CBT is helpful for realizing your negative thinking and switching it to more positive thinking. 

DBT is a skill based therapy that's best used in highly suicidal people and is usually the number one recommendation for those of us with BPD. DBT teaches you coping skills like how to manage your anger and intense emotions, mindfulness and how to stay in the moment as well as how to build positive relationships with others. As DBT is skill based, it takes a lot of practice actually using the skills before you master them, however they are extremely helpful for some people. It's a long process, but for a lot of people it's worth it.

To answer your question, CBT isn't necessarily any better or worse, it's just that CBT and DBT are used to treat different disorders. In terms of having BPD, DBT would be your best."

I, too, go from 0 to 100 in an instant whether it's what someone said setting me off or just built up anger throughout the day with every little thing adding up. What helps me is trying to be in the moment and practicing mindfulness. Deep breaths. Focus on how you're feeling, how your body is tense and try to relax your muscles. That takes time though. For a more immediate fix, simply walk away from the situation if you feel yourself getting heated. Take a 15 minute walk or go sit outside on the porch and take a break. Also taking a moment to think ""will I regret this?"" ""will my words hurt someone?"" ""what is the best thing to do in this situation?"" might help, but once again, it takes practice getting to this point rather than continuing to go down the same road every time. DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) also has an entire section of emotion regulation skills that would help with anger as well, in terms of more coping skills for these situations."

BPD,flywbuk,t3_fs15oi,1585610425.0,"It's hard to get a clear head when emotions and negative thoughts are swarming inside your head constantly. A DBT skill that I suggest for this is to get a bucket of cold ice water and (if you're ambitious) dunk your head in it. Dunking your hands or arms in it is good as well. It triggers your dive response and gives you a bit of a clearer head for awhile. Another skill requiring less (and a bit less messy haha) is mindfulness. Practicing being in the moment and on your surroundings instead of the thoughts clouding your head can help you be able to nudge through the warped thoughts and focus on what's true and really matters. In terms of making logical decisions, getting a second (or more) opinion can also be helpful that way you're able to see what others thing of it and if the thoughts are truly rational or not. Hope things get better soon, OP."
BPD,flyvoqc,t3_fs0lbn,1585610049.0,"I feel you. I hate being on lockdown, especially since it's messing with school (I'm a senior). I know it's hard, but try not to push these negative emotions onto other people and preserve these relationships. It's a tough time for everyone. In terms of how to actually do that, I'd suggest DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy). It provides coping skills and strategies to help with impulsive behaviours, anger and other emotions, how to not act on self harm urges, etc. Having another visit with your therapist (if you have one) to get some more helpful strategies is another good idea. One of the skills I like to use other than distraction (video games, going for a walk, watching a movie, etc.) when I'm having urges to self harm is to get an ice cube and squeeze it super hard and just let it melt in my hand, cooling me off both emotionally and physically. And if you're still taking your feelings out on your boyfriend, try to communicate why you're doing this and how you're trying to get better and maybe ask for some input on his end. I'm sorry you're going through this and I hope things get better soon."
BPD,flyuq9j,t3_fs116t,1585609494.0,"In terms of what to do with her longterm, I think, if you do not want another trip to an inpatient unit, it would be best to get her set up with a psychiatrist and a DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy) therapist. I'd suggest a DBT therapist given that she has BPD, and DBT can be extremely helpful for those of us with BPD and similar mental illnesses. It teaches and focuses on skills to manage your emotions and thoughts to help when things start to escalate. I don't know what symptoms she displays but just letting her know that you're there for her can be a big help, especially since a lot of people with BPD have a fear of abandonment. Also just sliding in there that (if you're in the United States), she can text the crisis chat 741741 if she's having suicidal thoughts and needs help deescalating or managing these emotions. Next step if things continue to get worse would be the psychiatric emergency room. Hope things get a little better!"
BPD,flytfpy,t3_fs0om4,1585608751.0,"You're not alone. I've felt like this and still feel this (poor self esteem, especially around my body, hating myself, not being understood, etc.) If you're feeling unsafe right now and you're in the United States, I'd suggest something that I do that helps deescalate my emotions: text the crisis line 741741 to be connected to trained counselors that can help you with these intense feelings. If that doesn't work, or even if these suicidal thoughts continue, go to the psychiatric emergency room and they'll be able to determine whether an inpatient stay is needed to keep you safe. Even though your FP didn't respond to your message, maybe try reaching out to another friend or family member who may be able to help in this situation. Sometimes if the feelings aren't that intense (though it sounds like they are), sometimes going for a walk or watching a movie to get your mind off things for awhile may help. Another piece of advice I can give is to work on your DBT (dialectical behavioral therapy) coping skills. Deep breathing, mindfulness, emotional regulation, etc. Bring your feelings up with your therapist (if you have one) to receive even more support and advice, but these are some things to do now while you're in crisis. Hope things go alright, OP. Remember: You are not alone and you are not worthless, even when it feels like it."
BPD,flysiwy,t3_fs0vae,1585608234.0,"I don't know exactly what will help your best friend, but I too have BPD and I'm going to give the best advice I can give, and what I would want help with. One thing I'd suggest, given that she is very focused on other's impression of her, wanting everyone to do everything for her, getting to an almost manipulative state, etc. is to set boundaries and not let her do that to you. I know it's easiest to give in, but in order to change these behaviours, you'll have to change your reaction. It will be hard at first, but I feel like it'll be most helpful in the long run. Do you know if she's seeing a DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy) therapist? DBT can be really helpful, especially for BPD because the skills it teaches (when practiced) can change these behaviours, especially suicidal ideation, emotional outbursts, etc. as well. A lot of this is on her and her actions, but just being there for her (especially if a lot of people have abandoned her in the past) can be helpful. Wishing you the best!"
BPD,flyp59b,t3_frzzs6,1585606365.0,"You are not broken. You are struggling right now and that's okay. It's hard when you are being invalidated, especially by someone so close. You don't have to do this alone. It might be helpful to look at DBT videos on YouTube that expand on the topics or more helpful even, to go to a DBT therapist (this can be done online, given everything going on right now) so you have someone to truly help you work through not only the workbook but also things like intrusive thoughts. DBT has a section for emotional regulation coping skills, but DBT is hard to master, especially when you don't have someone by your side helping you practice the skills and concepts. I understand getting overwhelmed, it's what causes a lot of my anger outbursts as well. There are skills in the workbook that you may find useful. Sometimes just taking a break or going for a walk, as you've done, may be helpful. Sometimes it just depends on the day. What matters most is that you keep trying and keep fighting. In terms of wanting to die, if you're in the United States, you can text the crisis line 741741 to talk to a trained counselor who will be able to help you deescalate as well as help you with working on those coping skills, etc."
BPD,flylsov,t3_fryovw,1585604551.0,"Like you said, even if he does not have BPD, a therapist or counselor, especially doing couples therapy, could be really helpful. It seems like the biggest issue is the anger outbursts, which at times are very severe. I'm sorry that you're going through this, especially with the quarantine heightening emotions further. I know that you want this to work, but verbal abuse is still abuse. I'm no therapist, rather someone that suffers from BPD myself and I'm just trying to give the best advice I can. In terms of suggestions for a therapist, a DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy) therapist could be really helpful. DBT focuses on coping skills and strategies and there is a module for emotion regulation, which I think he could benefit from. Also having an outlet for his anger, like basketball, painting, or any creative or physical activity, might help as a way for him to not take it out on you. A pattern of anger and expressing it towards you has been created, and it needs to be broken and replaced before things will get better. If he does indeed have BPD, a psychiatrist would definitely be helpful as well. I don't know if he's ever expressed suicidal tendencies (for example when you break up, etc.), however texting 741741 (if you're in the United States) for the crisis line and to talk to a licensed counselor or if things get escalated, calling the police like you have in the past. I truly wish you the best and I hope things get better! :)"
BPD,flye9su,t3_frx4b7,1585600531.0,"1) I'm currently taking lithium and latuda, however those medications are mainly to target my depression and anxiety and were the best combination available when I was doing ECT (electroconvulsion therapy). I wasn't diagnosed with BPD until recently, however they suggested staying on these meds.

2) Outside of medication, something I'd really reccomend is DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy) which is a skill based type of therapy revolving around the use and teaching of coping skills. A lot of people find it helpful for BPD, however it takes time to master.

3) My close family members know about my diagnosis as well as my school social worker and advisor, however that's about it.

- Honestly, I do look at my BPD as embarassing and something I'm ashamed of, given that I have very poor emotion regulation skills and typically my anger gets the best of me, even in public. Like you said though, it's nice having a back story or reason behind what I'm doing and who I am, even if it's not necessarily something good. Wishing you the best of luck with your new diagnosis and the future!"
BPD,flydj72,t3_frxcpt,1585600137.0,"A DBT workbook might be helpful, and those can be found on Amazon for around $30. I don't have one purchased from there, rather one I got through going to DBT group therapy that is similar, and I'd suggest going with one from Marsha Linehan, who is the creator of DBT. I think it's a good idea getting a workbook since then you'll be able to work through coping skills and they'll provide a lot of resources. In terms of the pandemic though, there's always the option of doing online or video chat therapy until things settle down. Best of luck! :)"

BPD,flnkbta,t3_fppjmp,1585320398.0,"That's a tough one, especially when it's daily. My advice is to try and switch it up. I know it's difficult to do given what's going on now, but whenever you're in a negative, depressed mindset, try to do the opposite. It's a skill called opposite action. If you feel like you want to hurt yourself, do something caring like doing a face mask or taking a shower. When you feel like crying, watch a happy movie (though sometimes crying does help). Long walks are another thing that helps me during these times, as well as distraction. I think DBT (dialectical behavioural therapy) might help, especially in times when you're in crisis. There's YouTube videos about the coping skills as well as websites with worksheets."

Doesn't mean it didn't sting though."

It may continue to be hard, but I believe in you. It won't always be this way. The sun will shine again and you will be happy, even if it comes in waves. I know what it's like to be at the lowest of the lows and want to end it all. I know you can make it through this hard time. Try to look up coping skills, DBT especially, they might help. In terms of relationships, communication is everything and in order to keep it going, tell your boyfriend how you're feeling. You've got this! One step at a time :)"
BPD,fllgdtb,t3_fpbpyx,1585259823.0,"I'm getting stir crazy as well, I understand. It's frustrating not being able to leave your house and even if you were to, everything is closed. Even though it may not seem like it, this is temporary. Eventually we will be able to resume our normal activities like going to the movies and hanging out with friends. To get through the stressful times right now though, I'd recommend using TIPP, a DBT skill that has a lot of use in many situations.

* **Tip the temperature -** dunk your head in a bowl of ice water or hold an ice cube until it melts, helping slow down your system and cool you off
* **Intense exercise -** doesn't have to be intense necessarily, but going for a long walk either outside or going to the gym, doing 15 jumping jacks, rest and then repeat, etc.
* **Progressive muscle relaxation -** tense your muscles real tight for a couple seconds, then relax for a few seconds, then repeat
* **Practice what works -** What has worked for you in the past? Maybe try calling a friend or family member, or if the crisis gets to an even worse point, maybe take a trip to the psychiatric emergency room

&#x200B;

DBT is helpful in terms of crisis skills like the one above, but it's also useful for all-around skills like controlling your emotions. In terms of things to do right now, going for a walk might be helpful or playing your favorite video game. Cooking is another good one since you're at home anyway, and it produces some delicious food for you (and your family). You can do this! I know it's frustrating and boring right now but you can get through it :)"

BPD,fllf0fl,t3_fpiq80,1585259078.0,"I agree completely. When I started up my Instagram account again, I was really upset and was immediately comparing myself to others and overall was just in a really negative frame of mind. As with the other user, I'd suggest deleting it. It has helped me so much being free of social media. Nice job with noticing the trigger and not immediately reacting, it's not always easy!"
BPD,flleqpe,t3_fpiwid,1585258933.0,"DBT (dialectal behavioral therapy) is something you can work on now. As for what it is, it's a type of therapy that is skill based. There are different modules or groups of skills including mindfulness, emotional regulation and others. A lot are coping skills and different ways to look at your current situation, but some are also informative and don't only apply to those of us who struggle with their mental health, such as how to be validating towards another person. **A big takeway from DBT is that it is dialectical. Two things can be true. You can be trying your best, but at the same time you need to do better. Coping skills are provided to aid you in this process.**

As another user said, you can look up videos on YouTube regarding DBT as well as books and workbooks that can be purchased on Amazon. No it's not a ""magical cure"", but the skills and information learned can be very helpful **if it's practiced**. Best of luck, OP!"
