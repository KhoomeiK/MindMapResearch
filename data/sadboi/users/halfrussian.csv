bipolarart,ew0kops,t3_cm4qym,1564993675.0,"There's no shame in that. It takes a lot of emotional energy to create that art.

When you're in the middle of an episode, creativity can act as a release for the extremes of the bipolar emotional spectrum, and to expect that same level of art from the stable you, as an act of spontaneity, seems unreasonable. 

However, Bob Ross said, ""talent is pursued interest,"" and I believe if you want to pursue that interest, the talent will surely follow.
