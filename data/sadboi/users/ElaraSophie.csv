(MtF 3 years in Hormones, 5 out)

I know the feeling I have 300 pounds too, despite having anorexia in my teen years. I don't get attention from men anymore like I used to. This is a hard pill to swallow.

BUT what does attention help when the men give me attention because they think I'm something I'm not? What does being thin help when I'm not myself? 

And you can loose weight in Transition too. The only real problem(for me) is attention from men, for gay men I'm too female, for straight men I'm too male, but I'm sure I go on, I will reach the point where I'm female enough for straight men.

Was geht es andere an ob du T nimmst und/oder eine OP machst? Es ist egal ob du anfangs sagtest du willst es nicht machen lassen, du h√§ttest dir ja damals einfach noch unsicher sein k√∂nnen und nichts versprechen wollen was dann nicht passiert.

Zur Hochzeit w√ºrde ich in der Tat Leute die hartn√§ckig den Deadname nutzen nicht einladen. Wer dich nicht respektiert hat an eurem Tag auch nichts zu suchen. Es ist nicht deine Schuld dass die Leute sich nicht an einen neuen Namen gew√∂hnen k√∂nnen. Es hat verdammt viel mit Respekt zu tun den richtigen Namen zu nutzen. Ich hatte mit meiner Familie den Kontakt abgebrochen weil sie den Deadname genutzt hatten, ich war damals noch am Anfang der Transition, aber ich fand es so unhaltbar respektlos. Mittlerweile sind wir bei ""der"" Sophie(Sophie ist mein ""Chosen""-Name... ich bin MzF). Keiner in meinem Umfeld nutzt mehr meinen Deadname, ich bin auch sehr bedacht darauf dass den niemand unn√∂tig erf√§hrt. 

Transneutral finde ich eine sch√∂ne Bezeichnung, noch nie davor geh√∂rt, aber ich wei√ü spontan was du meinst.

First of all English is not my mother tongue,so please pardon my mistakes.

I was suicidal today morning because I was weighted and I weigh 140kilo which is much too much... Fortunately I had therapy today and she brought me out of this (therapy via video conference at the moment because of Corona).

Bpd for me is a lot of feelings which are too strong to feel well. Wanting getting rid of this feelings at any cost, even if this means hurting myself... I learned how to handle these feelings in therapy, one thing is control of feelings means I can weaken these feelings by doing opposite actions, the other way is to do something not harmful(but non the less painful) like eating chillis or using a rubber band (or some other things which are not existent in the states).

The next big thing is emptyness, I fill with buying a lot more than I have money for. First thing Which helped with that was a legal guardian (think our system for this is better than the US afaik). We worked in the therapy on it mainly with mindfulness. Which helps too. Being in the moment, being in reality.

Then there is the big problem my personality is split into different characters(dis as diagnosis) because of trauma I had. Once thing we do here is reintegrate the parts in the big personality. The other thing is we don't work on the trauma directly, but on how to handle it. How to get out of a flashback or how to set memories aside.

I hope I didn't forget to much. :)"

World with medication: üòä

For me medication was a game changer, it helped me a lot. I would not say it alerted my personality, even though being not so scared I seem to be different. Only benzos and zdrugs make you addicted, normal neuroleptics don't. Initially you might get a lot of side effects but they fade with time. And if they don't you will change meds.

If you try meds and you recognize it was better without you can go off them anytime.
