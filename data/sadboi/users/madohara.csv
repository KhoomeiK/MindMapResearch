selectivemutism,fle9a4s,t3_foaatr,1585079986.0,"1. I think it‚Äôs fine as long as they‚Äôve *thoroughly* done research on the illness, personally know someone with the illness and have known/been close to that person for a long time, or are a specialist in treating the illness (this is still pretty on the fence though). It is possible, but often times when people who haven‚Äôt actually experienced it themselves try to write characters with an illness, it tends to be an inaccurate portrayal. I think it would be best if someone with depression/anxiety helped out the writer to make sure they aren‚Äôt doing a mis portrayal

2. There‚Äôs a manga called ‚ÄúKomi Can‚Äôt Communicate‚Äù or ‚ÄúKomi-san wa, Komyushou desu‚Äù that features a main character who has SM. She can‚Äôt talk to anyone at school or in person, but is fully capable of talking verbally via phone call and writing down her thoughts in a notebook. I think you can read it for free online and I highly recommend it because the representation is extremely accurate.

3. I personally love seeing a character‚Äôs personal struggles with their anxiety from their own point of view. A lot of the time their feelings and cause for reacting the way they do feel pretty shallow and I feel like it‚Äôs because people who write these characters don‚Äôt actually know what it‚Äôs like and that‚Äôs what I hate. I dunno if that makes sense but that‚Äôs all I got ^^"

dont quote me on this though haha i‚Äôm not saying you dont have any problems though because social anxiety definitely sucks!! as another comment stated you could have a very mild form of sm because social anxiety and selective mutism overlap a lot. if it‚Äôs really interfering with your life i recommend seeing a psychologist or someone who specialises in anxiety"

The rest of the characters interact/talk to the protagonist as they would to a person without SM, but the protagonist is never prompted to respond. It‚Äôs kind of hard to explain, but I can send you a video that shows what I mean. Anyway, the more you speak casually around them without pressuring them to talk much, the more comfortable they will be around you.
