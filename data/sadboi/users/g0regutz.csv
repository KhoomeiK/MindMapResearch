He was alive for a pretty long time considering his circumstances. It was truly awful.

I saw the suicide of a young girl. She hung herself and you could hear her mother calling her in for dinner. Seeing her feet at the top of the frame and her mother rushing towards her is something I will always remember.

I also one saw a man who had slit his wrists and was running around his house with the camera, showing all of the blood that he had lost. There was so much blood, i don’t understand how he hadn’t passed out. He was super shaky and waiting to die. It was pretty bad.

The first one was definitely the worst one though..."

Also, when we would put little pieces of meat in his kibble he would only eat the meat and spit out his regular food!
