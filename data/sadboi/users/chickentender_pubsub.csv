ynab,fqms0qt,t3_gjn1tu,1589482560.0,Absolutely! Every time I log into my bank accounts I’m amazed that I’m even carrying a balance. I’ve learned to ignore it since my real budget is on YNAB
birthcontrol,fms3imq,t3_fx1e1o,1586345380.0,"Best case scenario - they’re just worried about your health. You’re an adult and can decide what works for you/what doesn’t but your mom isn’t completely wrong about the pill. Birth control is awful for some ppl. I used it for 10+ years and didn’t realize it was contributing so much to my depression. I only felt the effects after coming off it completely for 8 months and then trying to get back on it. I still feel like I’m on a hormonal rollercoaster after trying 3 other pills that make me want to kill myself. 

Worst case scenario - talk to planned parenthood about an IUD. They work with you and it doesn’t have to go through their insurance. There are other options that might work if they are making a big deal about you using any contraceptives. 

Good luck !"
careerguidance,flkzjfq,t3_fpeu7g,1585250738.0,"Bad ? No , but it’s almost always better to find a new job than scraping by on unemployment checks. Have you calculated how much your state pays in unemployment? You might be surprised to see that it’s not much and you may be better off staying put and applying to new jobs in the meantime. Also good to note, there’s not too many companies hiring right now. I can def understand feeling frustrated :/ Best of luck to you !"
birthcontrol,fk2atp3,t1_fk0ymp8,1583796883.0,Ditto. The side effects you described are what I’ve been experiencing with 4 different pills since August. I’m on month 3 of the milli pill trying to level out. The suicidal thoughts are gone but my libido is shot and I’m constantly nauseous.
mentalhealth,finnz0i,t1_finmfx6,1582566855.0,I totally [understand](https://understand.You) . Mine were  bullet points ( not journal entries for the same reason)  I just used it as a starting point so it helped me narrow down what I wanted to talk about with them so I wasn't staring at my hands the entire session. I hope it helps!
mentalhealth,findal6,t3_f8pinp,1582561188.0,Have you tried writing down what you want to talk about at these therapy sessions ? I had trouble opening up at first but then I started taking notes every time I experienced a mood shift throughout the week. I'd bring this to my appointment; it was really helpful to have someone analyze those situations with me.
abortion,fi80f7y,t1_fhge31d,1582231123.0,thank you.
childfree,fdz7m19,t3_en6fve,1578787492.0,Same. I slept in then took my dog to brunch with a friend. Then we made strawberry mango daiquiris while working on a bob’s burgers puzzle that I want to put up in my office.
Fencesitter,fd2sjmh,t1_fcxqrpb,1578151269.0,Thank you. This helped a lot. Listing out the pros and cons really helped me see things clearly.
Fencesitter,fd2q0c9,t1_fcxveju,1578150537.0,"Wow I can 100% relate. You and your partner have been together longer and it sounds like you’re in a good place health wise. I saw someone here suggest making a pro/con list to help you decide. We did that this morning and he pointed out that I’m definitely more comfortable with the idea of abortion since my only pro point was “being at a good age for a healthy kid”. He supports whatever decision I make but agrees that every child should be wanted. 

Best of luck to you. I know how stressed you must be right now."
Fencesitter,fd2nrkf,t1_fcxtem0,1578149843.0,"I think the poster was trying to be helpful. I was freaking out and avoiding the test and talking to him but relationship wise , it’s absolutely better to discuss those things. We value communication and are in a good relationship. He’s been very supportive since we’ve talked about the possibility of pregnancy and me not keeping it."
Fencesitter,fd2mynv,t1_fcxqmwt,1578149522.0,I know this was probably coming from a good place  but open and honest communication is important to us.
Fencesitter,fcwqj3x,t1_fcwohf2,1578033687.0,Thank you. I think this whole ordeal is making me realize that I really don’t want kids.
depression,fakxbvb,t3_e9hksr,1576174702.0,Not bitter but definitely jealous and angry at myself for being this way. Going to therapy and understanding myself helps me manage it now but I get annoyed knowing I probably won’t achieve certain things because of the way I am.
depression,fahl7k1,t1_fahj7ns,1576088132.0,Agreed. And I know that everyone is going through things but it just feels like others are able to achieve all the things I can’t. I hope it gets better for you.
childfree,fahh6s3,t1_faf6nbv,1576085844.0,ooo Thanks! I'm going to pick up some tortellini and attempt this tonight :)
depression,fahelco,t3_cml6ni,1576084532.0,"I woke up in a great mood today but just finished crying in the bathroom at work and talking myself out of self harming. 

I spiraled into negative thinking after my boyfriend told me he received an offer for a job he interviewed for last week. I know his success is not my failure but I've been looking for a job since March and this is now the fourth person that's found a great job in the time that I've been looking. It just feels like another thing I can't do well."
childfree,faezb5l,t3_e8buj1,1576011256.0,Boyfriend gifted me an instant pot for Christmas (we're both taking international trips around the holidays so we did an early gift exchange) and it's been the highlight of my week so far! I've been binge-ing youtube videos on recipes. Now that I'm here talking about it I want to look for a reddit thread too ! :)
birthcontrol,f9lh4ew,t1_f9jxphg,1575422958.0,Can you share the amazon link? Or brand name ? I’m interested in trying these.
depression,f0m1b7k,t3_d5dymq,1568734466.0,Yup. I feel like most people in my life tolerate me and it makes me question every interaction and conversation I have.
AskHR,f0kr4a5,t1_f0invto,1568685939.0,"I remember reading that the saying originated with cell phones. Out of pocket meant that you were out of the cell phone service area because they had “pockets” of coverage. In other words, you’re unreachable."
depression,f06c2lc,t3_d3xhot,1568434555.0,I can relate so much but some weeks are harder than others. Hang in there!
AskHR,eyo0pyk,t1_eymim9w,1567266791.0,"Yes ^ this. I’d just like to see the reviews in order to make my case again or improve in any areas that may need improving. I know the company is not obligated to give me a pay increase but other than continued employment, I have no way to gauge if I’m improving."
personalfinance,ey5cbmp,t3_cvo93p,1566828025.0,"That's awesome! Changing your mindset is really what makes it click. Thanks for sharing, it encouraged me to take another look at my monthly subscriptions. There's definitely things I can cut back on."
mentalhealth,exiem1g,t1_exgts4e,1566326740.0,"Glad I'm not the only one either! It's a great skill, don't get me wrong, but if we're using it as a means of punishment then we're still avoiding the root of the issue :/ I'm sure you're better than you think."
mentalhealth,exgkjbq,t3_csm5qv,1566266446.0,Jiu jitsu has been it for me lately. After years of not self harming I had a relapse and then found Jiu jitsu.  I recently realized it’s my way to hurt myself but it’s socially acceptable because I can call it “training”.
mentalhealth,exf6ju8,t3_csgx2g,1566233809.0,"First off, I commend you for taking the steps to do therapy. Even if it's every two weeks, its someone that can advise you and help give you methods to dealing with mental health issues. It sounds like you are lacking a support system and reaching out to your parents has not [ ](https://helped.It)helped. I'm sorry they are unable to comfort you in this way. You are not pitiful for experiencing life events like flooding or bad relationships; although they are sometimes unfortunate and take time for us to process. I see a great outlook for your future, you seem very self aware and working on these emotional things while you are single will make you a great partner to someone. Do you have friends that you can reach out to and feel comfortable sharing with when you need comfort? The right friends can be a great source of encouragement. It can be difficult to meet new people but a good friendship is worth the effort and can be a wonderful source of comfort."
personalfinance,exd9v47,t1_ex49kup,1566170989.0,Thank you for the input.  I really appreciate hearing this from someone that is in a field related to HR. I think I'm going to take a semester off and complete a cert. before finishing the MBA. It might give me a leg up in my job search right now.

personalfinance,ex3dgee,t1_ex3atqo,1565983851.0,"It's not entirely relevant but I'm in a dual role where I utilize some of what I've learned. Thanks for weighing in. It is early in my career, maybe taking a break to do a cert. will give me time to decide if finishing the MBA is worth it."

depression,ex3541k,t3_cr7t6c,1565980260.0,here I am at 29 wondering the same thing....I've gotten better at managing it though. I've come to terms with it never going away and just learning how to live with it.
relationship_advice,euvl4di,t1_eutpreq,1564062163.0,"Thank you! This was very helpful. You're right, there's details that he doesn't need to know and I don't feel comfortable sharing just yet."
