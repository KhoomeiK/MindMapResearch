Personally, I think something which I notice quite a lot is how I naturally take charge. He's not I rely bothered by it and it certainly doesn't cause friction, but he does mention it from time to time. I've also had quite a lot of mental health issues over the years which has absolutely softened me and I have a lot to thank him for, so although there is the occasional power struggle, we are equals which is why I think it works. He's a very manly man, plays rugby, earns big, highly competitive so it's almost like this shouldn't work? But it does. I'm not in a great place in terms of career at the minute, I'm not challenged enough and I feel my life opportunities slipping away, but COVID is a BIG hurdle! My husband is making millions in savings and the sun basically shines out of his arse at work, which is actually making me incredibly jealous. I tell him I want to know and to not stop telling me (as he can see it bothers me) but it's basically like prodding a lion in a cage and expecting it not to get angry. 

There's so much more to it but typing on my phone at any free opportunity really tests my patience haha! So I'd say unbalanced careers are definitely an issue, maybe more so the other way round I imagine (female earns more than male?), just my thoughts, but also that there is definitely a power struggle which is well balanced for us through communication. EMOTIONAL communication. It's a life saver. Our willingness to accommodate eachother and understand eachother is definitely the best part, as it makes way for so many other good things. Unwanted life experiences are essentially what changed me as I used to close shop and bury feelings and not even acknowledge others had any, but that's why the saying ""without rain, nothing grows"" exists I guess.

Slight differences now, have been married nearly 8 years in June and together for just over 10. We met through mutual friends through school who neither of us are actually friends with anymore because our lives are nothing alike and we have very different priorities; that's just what happens I guess? We were married at 20/21 and people thought we were totally insane, but I can genuinely say when you know, you know. To everyone's disapproval, I'd also fallen pregnant at 19 and we've still proven everyone wrong. I had never worked a 'proper' job at this point with college etc., and my husband was just starting out in his career. I didn't start working until I was 25 and our son had started school, and started out in admin (arrgghhh!). Now in office management but it's mind numbing and really not what I want to be doing, but what I take away from this is that everything my husband and I have achieved in the last 10 years is totally against the odds and it's entirely because we're a bloody awesome team! I'd read that our types weren't particularly compatible, but there are two separate relationships here and we have clearly hit the nail on the head! I definitely second being in the places you enjoy being to meet someone. I guess it makes sense when you think about it?

I think you should really reconsider telling her, whether it's anonymous or not, she deserves to know the truth.

When its over, I feel like total shit, and actually can't begin to think about what happened or why. I'm not sure I ever do, it's just exhausting. Please know, this is no justification, just an insight for people who may not know what it's like (I'm sure you're quite aware to suspect such a thing). And for you, know that maybe she doesn't have the capacity to discuss this, as opposed to not wanting to. The best way to describe it for me is like Jekyll and Hyde. It absolutely blows. However, you have clearly been very supportive of her which is amazing, but she also needs to hold up her end of the deal. She absolutely needs to rein this in for your sake, and your son's, and most importantly hers as it's such self destructive behaviour.

I'm so sorry this happened, I can't imagine being emotionally hurt like this. Please do what you can to get her to help herself, but take the time you need for you too.

It sounds like you've just entered a rut. Maybe more so on her part, but it certainly doesn't sound like anything extreme. But I can definitely say that this woman is appearing more appealing to you *because* of of the negative feelings you're having towards your wife. You're ruminating on everything that is wrong with you wife, and at the same time, fantasising about everything that is great about this woman. You don't have to deal with any of the issues you have with your wife with her, she's literally perfect in comparison, but the grass is NOT always greener. 

I absolutely do not think you should jeopardize your marriage for this. But as I subtly mentioned at the start, you need to communicate these issues your having with her. Work on them together. Don't react badly if she's initially hurt by what you say, it's about teamwork and aslong as she's prepared to put the effort in, over time, you can get your spark back. Despite your efforts, no one is psychic, and she genuinely probably doesn't notice your little gestures, and even more so doesn't realise that she's shitting you down and the effect this has on you. 

These things take time, but be open to her and, without *blaming* or saying ""you do this and it makes me feel this"", try saying things in a more constructive way - as you would at work. We don't want it to be a blame game. I said this to someone the other day, but the saying **""the grass isn't always greener""** exists for a reason. I really hope you both manage to work this out."

You need to take care of your own mental health for a while and let the dust settle, as the only dysfunctional behaviour I see here is that of your friends and family.

He sees me when I'm in pain and I tell him how I can't imagine being back at work like that. I am trying to find work, but it does concern me as it's got a lot worse in recent months. My advice would definitely be to get this sorted and know where you stand in terms of treatment etc before committing to work, as it can be very enduring. Laproscopy recovery time etc if needed can be weeks and weeks.

I am madly in love with my husband **BECAUSE** he provides us with everything we need, **BECAUSE** he's a great father and everything else, and this won't change. The fact he's willing to help around the house - despite me currently being unemployed due to redundancy - is only proof to me everyday that he cares for our wellbeing and our marriage, as he knows I'm having a hard time. I would do the same for him, because we're a team. **THIS IS NOT ON YOU!** Your wife for whatever reason wants something new and fun without giving a shit about the fact she has what, and that's on her. There is nothing you could've done differently about that imo. 
Please take up the advice of consulting a lawyer, even if you think there's a chance you may wish to reconcile with her. At least you'll know where you stand in the future, and what to say/do and what not to say/do.

I'm so sorry this has happened :( Best of luck.

*Edit for people below:*
Please don't tarnish all women with this dirty brush. As a teenager, appearance was everything. As I grew older (I'm still only v. late 20's) my perspective of 'attractiveness' has changed. I will never consider cheating on my husband because I have it too good at home and meet someone ""sexy"". Decent women do exist and I really hope you all find one - no one deserves to be treated like that."

I woke the other night mid orgasm and before beginning the actual deed, I checked if he was fully awake.

I'm used to this so I'm not offended or anything, it's just something he does! 

The point is, it's definitely likely you don't realise it's you. If she's okay with it (which it appears she is) then you have nothing to worry about on that front. But if it makes you uncomfortable, you need to communicate to her that when you do this, you don't want her to allow you to continue it. It's great fun if both parties are into it, but you don't want feel regretful of your own actions, especially if you can't control them. Hope this gives you a little insight. Best of luck!"
