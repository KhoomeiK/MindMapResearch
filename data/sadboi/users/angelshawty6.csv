Anxiety,f4iqv45,t3_dkqbx1,1571608161.0,"Talk to them about it, and if they don’t listen they aren’t your true friends. I had to deal with ”friends” like that before and they would take me as a joke and wouldn't listen. I knew ignoring them and not talking to them anymore would be best."

antidepressants,ezyhc0h,t1_ezyghoc,1568268091.0,"I take mine right in the morning around when I wake up. I’ve had a few drinks here and there but I wouldn’t recommend any heavy drinking or anything excessive because you are more vulnerable to blackout
and it’s just generally avoided by most people. I’ve never had any major issues with drinking on zoloft but that’s just me."
antidepressants,ezyg4tw,t3_d33esq,1568267474.0,"I’ve been taking zoloft (25mg) for about 3 months now. From my experience I only experienced a few side effects when first starting it for example, I ate way less, and could not sleep at all for the first few weeks. As weeks passed I finally was able to sleep better while also noticing pretty significant mood changes. I was more happy and energized throughout the day. It’s different for everyone but I sure am thankful for stumbling across zoloft. It basically saved me and took me out of the deep hole I was in."
benzodiazepines,eyo8tjk,t3_cxxyor,1567272221.0,something similar also happened to me while on xanax lol
