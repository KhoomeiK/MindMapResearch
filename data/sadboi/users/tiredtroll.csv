Being a kid's parent doesn't automatically give you license to treat it however you want, and other people have the right to step in if you're being a cruel or not doing it at all like in this case. If the kid was a baby that's one thing but OP said in a different comment that the kid was old enough to know what shoosh means so I assume the dad coulda told them to quiet down. If a kid old enough to be reasoned with is yelling in public and the parent isn't going anything people can either tell the parent to take responsibility or the kid to shoosh as long as they're polite, which the person was, at least as far as I could tell. Also, someone in daycare who is screened, trained, and paid to deal with kids probably knows their stuff. Idk where you got condescension from."

CPTSD,fh6d5sm,t1_fh5ylrp,1581297482.0,"Yeah, I too wondered about that, that doesn't seem as bad as the rest. I make an attempt to laugh at people's jokes even when I don't understand them or when I do understand but don't think they're funny, but I thought most people didn't laugh at jokes they thought weren't funny, but I am autistic so it's hard to conceptualize what allistic people might do in such an instance? I'm not sure if it's necessary an autism thing though, but one can have a lot of traits but not others that are more typical of autism and still be autistic, or have some traits that are commonly associated with autism and not have it. Look into it if you suspect it OP because especially in people that aren't men it's not obvious because autism when it was first discovered was thought to only be a guy thing and so the majority of stereotypes and diagnostic materials are centered around how men tend to express autism. Especially if you have other autistic people in your family as it does tend to be genetic. One therapist telling you it's not autism, especially if they aren't an autism specialist and sometimes even when they are isn't a definite no. Though there is a bit of overlap between PTSD, esp C-PTSD (disliking eye contact, disliking being touched, some sensory issues, lack of social skills, overstimulation and irritability) and some autistic traits so again, so it's not always easy to distinguish and you thinking you might have it isn't like..bad or anything, in the sense that being autistic isn't bad and that thinking you might be isn't bad, even if you're not. It doesn't make you a faker or an attention seeker (seeking attention isn't inherently bad either unless you harm others or yourself, sometimes you need attention because you need help, either emotional support or out of a bad situation, needing help is okay), and in the end you know your own brain, behaviors, and how you perceive the world better than anyone else ever could, and from what I can tell you just want to better yourself and understand your place in the world."

SelfAwarewolves,fg1egmk,t3_ew3thp,1580425651.0,"Attention? Lmao have they spoken to us, we just want equitable treatment, to be treated like normal people. We just want to be able to go through life and be called by our correct name and pronouns without having to spend an hour justifying our existence by explaining pertinent bits of biology, sociology, psychology, anthropology to someone who's probably just gonna reply ""but the chromosomes"". We don't expect people to always get it right or look at us out on the street and be like ""oh they're non-binary""; we just want people to try to understand, or if they can't or don't want to understand to just be chill. If someone corrects you with their name and pronouns it's not a personal attack, it's just a reminder, and if they're a jerk about it that's them and not a reflection of the entire minority. 

We want legal protections so we dont get evicted, fired, or denied service at hospitals, the ability to change our documents to reflect our identities (like an Mx. in place of Ms. or Mr. and X in place of F or M on our IDs if we want it), to be able to transition medically if we want to, and general societal acceptance so people are at least respectful and don't harass or beat us up.  That's it, basically the same things binary trans folks want. 

Side notes for educational purposes: Non-binary people is an umbrella term for various identities that are partially or completely not men or women. Non-binary people are generally considered to be transgender. Transgender means someone who is a gender different than the one assumed at birth based on ones sex; no one is assigned non-binary at birth. It's not defined by having gender dysphoria or by how much someone wants to medically transition though most binary and non-binary trans folks do have dysphoria and want to transition medically to some degree. Some trans people only experience gender euphoria which is immense happiness felt from being seen/acknowledged as the gender they'd like to be seen as while dysphoria is basically the opposite, though it's a bit more complicated. Most trans people experience both euphoria and dysphoria, some experience one or the other. Transgender people often don't have the same degree of gender dysphoria as other trans people or don't have dysphoria about the same things so they don't want to medically transition in the same ways as other trans people might, or at all. Other don't transition because of the lack of acceptance trans people often deal with. Non-binary folks are the white stripe on the trans flag, though we have our own flag. I should add not all n-b folks consider themselves transgender, I can't really say why because that's not my experience but I respect it."

CPTSD,fe3usya,t3_enmjqd,1578853108.0,"I had a similar experience in a way.  We had neighbors around my age that had a big sledding hill, so we all did it together.  Afterwards I was invited over to play and said yes, and then they invited me to stay for dinner.  Everyone was so kind and warm, they made a plate for me and we ate and talked together at the table without any demeaning remarks or shouting, then my older sister came to get me mid meal and I had to leave.  She seemed tense and I was confused.  When we got home my grandparents (my legal guardians for most of my childhood and main verbal and physical abusers) were pissed and yelled at me for an hour because I didn't ask apparently even though my sister let them know where I was, and they were angry saying I shouldn't impose when it was the family that asked me to stay.  I didn't know I needed to ask because I was pretty young a the time and they were always inconsistent about when I was supposed to ask to do things.  Sometimes I was allowed to go to neighbors houses without asking as long as I was home before it was too dark, other times like that they got angry because I didn't ask.  Sometimes they would get mad at me for asking if I could go to the bathroom at dinner, other times they would be angry at me for getting up from the table without asking to be excused.  I wasn't allowed to ask to go to someone's house but if someone asked me to go to their house it was okay.  If I could take the bus there and had a ride home it was fine but sometimes they'd be willing to drive me.  Sometimes they preferred if when I had someone over, which was rare (once my grandma made one of my friends have a panic attack so I didn't invite people over often after that), that they stayed the whole weekend and other times grandma got mad at me for letting a friend stay too long and took them home on Saturday.  I guess it's reasonable to have me ask to go places but they were never consistent about whether or not they wanted me to and they were always way too harsh whenever I got on their bad side, particularly my grandmother.  My grandfather was also abusive physically and verbally but less so than my grandmother and tended to follow her lead on most occasions.  Anyway, I was never allowed over there again, and I moved in with my uncle much later when I was 15 without being able to say goodbye to most of my friends (and the move wasn't necessarily going to be permanent but I knew when I left that I never wanted to go back.) or even tell my therapist I had at the time until she called me wondering if I was okay ( I only got to go because I insisted I needed to for months and our appointments weren't that often so my grandma was willing to drive me, but I sat in the waiting room alone)."

AmItheAsshole,fdur197,t1_fduh2c1,1578737646.0,"There are different kinds of vegetarians and plant based diets.  Some occasionally or regularly eat eggs, some eat fish and other sea creatures, some eat chickens, some eat dairy, some eat beef. Vegans are vegetarians but not all vegetarians are vegan, both are plant based diets but not all plant based diets are either. The main defining feature of a vegetarian diet is that you mostly or exclusively eat plants, and people eat plant based diets for various reasons ranging from environmentalism, moral qualms with industrial farming, and allergies/intolerances. In my case I wouldn't personally call myself a vegetarian because I occasionally eat meat and one of my bigger flaws is that I tend to be a pedant (another is that I cannot be concise), though I would call my diet plant based because that's what I mostly eat. What it comes down to is there's a big difference between putting a label on yourself and mostly adhering to it and being labeled by others; the latter tends to bother people because many societies put a focus on the individual, self determination, and self identity.  

tl;dr There are probably many people that wouldn't call your uncle a vegetarian, but your uncle gets to call himself whatever he wants and that's fine."

A lot of these people are otherwise religous or non-religous, and so I doubt it's them substituting this for organized religion for the most part unless they're into some variant of witchcraft/neopaganism.  And many of those that are into witchcraft are just into it for the aesthetic, not that I'm saying there aren't true believers of Wicca, Heathenism, Vodoun, Hoodoo, or other neopagan religions that may or may not incorporate astrology.  There are also feminists that use witchcraft as a sort of symbolism for their movement (as well as for the aesthetic as mentioned above), like many Satanists (The Satanic Temple) are atheists and use Satan as a symbol for freedom and independence, and to challenge Christian supremacy in America.

I've met people who are serious and won't date (blank) sign or think all (blank) signs are trash, or they'll try to guess what sign you are based on some arbitrary personality trait they perceive in you, but those seem to be in the minority and most people just know their sun sign because they saw it in a news paper or magazine, or looked it up at one point because they were curious, and like shit posts about what song their sign is or whatever.

tl;dr: I'm skeptical (haha) that this is a sign of an irrational or dumbed down populus, or some rise of astrology as a major religion."

My mom was the type of person who was a ""bitch"" by her own admission but proud of it.  She was very immature and we were more like friends (I was her therapist a lot of the time) than she was my mother.  She was closer with my sister because she was old enough to drink and do drugs with than she was with me, leading me to follow suit when I got old enough so we would be able to bond and so the would show any interest in me, which only kind of worked, at least in the former way because we spent time together.  I didn't feel like I had an excuse to cut contact with her for a long time because she loved me and was more or less kind to me, but she still let her boyfriend and her parents abuse me right in front of her without ever defending me.  I felt like because she never intended to hurt me that I was being overdramatic."

Often they'll call themselves transexual and think non-binary/gender non conforming binary trans folks aren't actually trans.  Along the same vein, a truscum is someone who thinks you need dysphoria to be trans, which in itself sounds fine until you look at places without informed consent.  The medical definition of dysphoria is very lacking due to not a lot of research existing on it, so to be classified as dysphoric one has to be 1) binary 2) straight 3) experience dysphoria/stereotypical signs of dysphoria such as playing with typically feminine toys for example as a child if you're MTF.  People don't all experience dysphoria in the same way, for example some FTM people experience dysphoria about their chests while others don't, or some MTF people experience bottom dysphoria while others don't.  Some people don't experience dysphoria in a typical way, or at all either before transition or after.  Some people only experience gender euphoria, the flip side of dysphoria, which means they'll feel happy when presenting/expressing themselves as the gender they really are.  Being transgender is defined as being a gender different than the one assigned at birth based on your birth sex, not dysphoria.  TL;DR, Transmed and truscum are gatekeepers, the one true scotsmen of the trans community, and are where the term ""transtrender"" came from.

That is not something anyone should be asking another human being to go through if they don't want to do it, that's inhumane.  Having sex does come with responsibilities (consent, preventing STDs, and preventing pregnancy if you don't want it) but that doesn't mean we should be forcing anyone to go through a painful medical procedure that is expensive and has numerous risks (people didn't used to die left and right from childbirth for no reason, modern medicine has helped but there's still the factor of poverty which causes a lot of complications, especially if you have to work to pay for all that, which isn't great for the baby or the birther, and there is also the possibility that you can lose your job if you get pregnant which is worse).  My point is that some people are not in a position to have more kids, maybe they're too young (and if someone is too young to vote, drink, or smoke they shouldn't be held as responsible as an adult would be in that situation, also it's dangerous not only to have children at that age in general but to that person's future as well as teen pregnancies often end in drop outs), maybe the person was assaulted, maybe they're poor, maybe they're poor and already have mouths to feed, maybe they never want kids ever and they can't get sterilized because it's rare to find a doctor who will sterilize a childless person under 30 and the condom slipped, it doesn't matter.  Abortions are expensive too, and are difficult to get because it usually involves a 3 day wait and going to a different city.  Nobody gets an abortion because it's fun or as birth control, nobody could afford to never use condoms and just get abortion after abortion whenever they got pregnant.

I see all the comments telling you to see a special therapist, and I want you to know that if you can't afford that there is still hope for you.  I want you to know that you can grow still, be better still.  If you can afford meditation retreats and trauma specialists please take advantage of that, but if you can't, a good way to heal is to push yourself to engage in a hobby.  Nothing you need to monetize or even physically do.  

Type out stories, draw, read, binge hulu, play video games online if you can afford that.  Aaanything you want, but busy your mind, find ways outside of it, something that brings you peace inside and forces you out of dangerous headspaces.  Playing online games is a decent way to extend your friends circle and distract yourself as well, or maybe try to join some discord servers based off of the things that you like. 

I'm sorry about what happened to you, and I really relate, which is why I just wanted to say that even when it feels so dark and lonely, there's still a future.  It's almost entirely uncertain, which means you could make it great."

The subject here is transgender people.  That's the point.  That, and transgender women experience disproportionately high amounts of murder, rape, and assault when they're such a small subset of global population, so when a woman who is trans gets murdered it kind of is a big deal, especially to other trans people.  Again, this is r/transgender."

I remember telling my uncle about how my mother reacted to me being molested (dead stare, legit just ""oh sorry honey"", changes the subject), and he said I should consider that she doesn't know how to handle that and ""what could she do?"", oh I dunno, at least actually let me talk about it, support me, nurture me.  He made me feel bad about being upset with her, and I freaking bought it.  
The sad part is that my mother spent a lot of my childhood in jail for reasons so she was trying really hard to get back into my life.  This was her trying her best.  I didn't even go NC with her because of that, I went NC with her after she asked if I was off my meds after telling her I went NC with my ngrandparents for being verbally and physically abusive all my life, something she also delt with from those...  People."

Anarchy101,et4dl1s,t1_et446zx,1562448301.0,"I would argue that eating meat at least is essential to a lot of people's survival (though not everyone's, and the amounts necessary vary) as it contains nutrients that people need to survive and can't get from anywhere else other than supplements that they would have to purchase and that may not be accessible.  
I feel that saying people don't need to eat animals is a bit..dishonest considering that meat contains nutrients like B12, creatine, and carnosine which can't really be gotten in other places unless we genetically engineered some veggies, which I'm up for if it's safe.  I am not trying to say that eating meat is superior either, I'm saying that veganism isn't an option for everyone or what they want to do with their bodies, and what one puts into their bodies is an intimate personal choice that should be informed by your individual nutritional needs."

People are poor man, a lot of people can't afford non otc birth control or sterilization, and ""improper use"", like putting on a condom wrong (?), if I am interpreting correctly, is due to lack of sex ed or an accident, which isn't really an individual's fault, or even if you construed it to be their fault..  Forcing people to give birth is inhumane and a fetus isn't a person above the one carrying it unless that person expresses otherwise.  It's between that person and their doctor, and if the sperm donor is included that's nice, but it's not a right.  And it isn't the government's right to bud in, or your right to use the government to try to bud in.  In less convoluted terms, bud out.  It's not your business."

I'm not really talking about people like me though, because most people would agree that my having an abortion would be reasonable, I'm talking about typical people with typical bodies that don't want kids, and for whatever reason that is it should be respected, and especially in these sorts of cases with college students for reasons I've already talked about."

Scared, and rightfully so.  If you go to college with a child or multiple you are a goddamn super hero going out to stop sky scrapers falling by hand every damn day.  But not everyone can do that, not everyone should be expected to do that, and there should be help for people who do chose to do so like daycare, good busing systems, and food stamps so that healthy nutritious foods are provided during pregnancy and after.  And health care, prenatal and after, and better schools.  Y'all ever think about all that?  And there should be early detection and outs for people who can't or don't want to.  Nobody's having an abortion to fit into a bikini.  People are definitely having abortions when all they could offer a kid is a one room (probably shared) flat and ramen, and don't you bring up adoption dammit, my points still stand, and most of y'all hate gay ppl so who's going to adopt the kids, huh?  You?  I doubt there are enough infertile couples to go around, and some people would have to stop having kids all together, which people are also against.  Sorry for the rant but yes, we are indeed scared of the ramifications of this on ourselves and on wider society if this shit spreads.  Forcing people to have children they do not want to have is inhumane regardless.  Having a baby, at best, is moderately painful and changes your body forever.  That is without complications, and do you think a college student can afford to have a goddamn baby, or raise that baby, are you serious?  Just having a baby is expensive as hell, there's extra costs for holding them, and what if the kid is jaundiced or premature?  The hospital bills qre difficult enough for someone who is prepared to raise a child, but imagine this on a college student who will already likely be in debt from getting the education that is required to live off of more than a weekly/montly paycheck without being extremely lucky, hard work my butt, most people are rich out of luck, and poor people are not poor by laziness or choice. Republicans love to tout themselves as the party of individual choice, but choice for who?  Not for women, poor people, homeless people, gay/trans people, the disabled, and if you're a person of color good fucking luck.  Things are plenty scary."
