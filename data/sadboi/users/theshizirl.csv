alcoholism,fr3mzp2,t3_gmg90z,1589861050.0,"The only thing for me that worked with this is making myself believe that either the alcohol deceived me into thinking I was only myself when drunk, or that even if I only was myself when drunk, it wasn't my best self...and as alcohol is, you know, liquid courage, it would always make me think I was the best thing ever when I wasn't always that good.

I also know I'm not a bad person and that I'm a better person than I was yesterday, but that alcohol made me do things that weren't ""me"" and therefore, whatever version of myself I thought was complete with alcohol wasn't the best version. Life is hell when I'm drunk all the time and so even if days are boring and stupid-feeling sometimes, it's better than the constant guilt, beating myself up over things, hiding everything, etc.

Another thing that helps is my wife. She's not a ""thing"" but you know. I hate hiding things from her, and alcohol \*always\* leads me to hiding things from her. Sometimes, just thinking of her smiling at me while I know I would be hiding my decision to drink is enough to deter me from buying that bottle of beer or wine at the store. I'd rather be anxious and sober than relaxed but knowing I'm keeping things from the woman I have given my life to.

In whatever way works, I think you just need to decide that your self-image when you're drunk is inaccurate, and that you only think it is because it's all you've known. Hope that helps."
mentalillness,fr3m3lu,t3_gjkig2,1589860443.0,"If you're in doubt you need to suggest that he get into counseling. You can't make him do it and should not try to (no one should tell adult loved ones what to do); but perhaps he would find it reassuring if he saw that you were concerned enough for his well-being to discuss going in to some therapy. But proceed gently and seek guidance in how to do it. 

I'm not gonna attempt to act like a therapist (I'm not), but I do have OCD myself and I'm currently working towards my degree in mental health counseling, so maybe I can offer my own two cents on the matter. Always remember to never seek professional advice on Reddit, google, or from anyone but an actual professional. 

In my experience, no, intrusive thoughts are not inherently dangerous. As a kid I would get intrusive thoughts about harming my family and it would bring me great agony, suffering and grief because I loved them so much and would \*never\* do anything to hurt them. Through years of therapy I learned that thoughts are just thoughts, and that they do not have power over my actions and choices. Therapy taught me how to recognize intrusive thoughts, dismiss them, and let them go. They're a function of an imbalance, not a flaw in character, and can't be helped. 

One thing you'll see in a lot of guides about OCD is that intrusive thoughts are part of the condition and most people who have them (I say ""most"" because the stats are always changing, and there is never a perfect incidence/absence of any trend in mental health) do not act on them and, in fact, are peaceful and gentle people who hate such unpleasant thoughts. 

Again, encourage him to get into some counseling but also be careful not to feed his obsessions. Also, if he hasn't actually been diagnosed with OCD, don't call it that. This is because OCD, like any medical condition, requires a specific diagnosis for a plan of treatment and, therefore, it is a call that only a professional can and should make. 

Good luck."

bibros,fr34fe0,t3_gla2qw,1589849732.0,"I'll tell you the same advice i tell every other guy I know regardless of orientation: get out of the ""dating"" mindset and just focus on getting around people, specifically doing what you like.

Just go do things on your time off that you like, and always be ready to make friends or even just interact with people. For instance I love playing paintball, and when I go to the field I enjoy giving a compliment here and there, which always leads to buddying up with other players, at least for the day. If you love plays, go see a play on a Saturday and talk to people while you wait for it to start, and give your thoughts during intermissions, for example. 

I met my wife when I was winging one of my best friends during his bday party, where my wife was serving as a lookout for the friend my buddy was interested in. Just be ready and keep your options open.

Oh, and it sounds like you're specifically looking for other men. I would suggest doing your hobbies in places with higher populations of gay individuals, or even just in places with more younger people. My first serious gay relationship was with a tutor I met in a pretty conservative area. I didn't know a whole lot of other men who were gay or bi there so I have no idea if this would have happened outside of how we met way back then. Set yourself up for success but don't overthink it.

That was a ton of text on my part. Good luck and keep us posted."

I think the best part, for me, though, is that when we're having a hard time trying to figure out how to act like a couple in new situations, we go back to our friendship and everything feels like a co-op that we have always done, but better.

It also makes sex great because it's like we are doing something we always wanted to do when we were simply best friends. It's hard to explain. When it's not going so well and it seems like a cluster of disasters in a given session, we practice the same grace and understanding friends would. When it's extraordinary and it feels like a winning streak, we celebrate and enjoy it even more. It's awesome, and makes me feel all melty, warm and soft inside when I think about it.

Always marry your friends. When marriage inevitably feels mysterious and even impossible at times (every marriage does from time to time), that friendship will ease the experiebce. 5 awesome years with my best friend has taught me that."

You need to find out why making people aware of your struggles helps and why you should keep doing it. Some people go to groups for emotional support, others, like me, *need* to tell people when I’m being tempted to relapse or else I *will*, guaranteed 100%, succumb so I just gotta do it.

DirtyWritingPrompts,fqexb1i,t3_gidv83,1589315130.0,"Prince Abrams- a moderately tall, get handsome young man with light auburn hair brushed behind his right ear- approached the witch’s cottage, with little more expression than one of slight irritation. He knocked on the magister’s door, attempting to stave away the discreet band of burgundy running across his cheekbones.

The witch, an ancient woman who, via powerful magic, maintained the guise of a young lady no later in life than in her early thirties at most.

“H-here I am,” the prince blushed.

 “Hmm, you’re even more dashing than I recall, your highness! I’m looking quite forward to...gaining your knighthood this fortnight.” 

 The deceptively young-looking crone eyed her prize up and down, as an adder salivates over the unfortunate rodent it plans to take for a meal.

 “Stop! I mean...” 

 Prince Abrams stammered.

 “Wit- pardon, Milady. I am doing this per father’s orders in gratitude for you turning away the kingdom’s enemies from decimating the capital yesterday...”

 The witch nodded softly.

“...but I do not feel at liberty, truly, to be indecent. I am not even engaged yet. Have you any sympathy, enough to turn me about my way and-“

 The witch cut the prince off with a prompt ankle click on the floor of partially molded hardwood slabs.

 “Silence! A reward is a reward. Like hell I will pass up the chance to enjoy the fairest man in Saphiria. Take it out.” 

The magister pointed below the prince’s belt, while parting her navy blouse and beginning to unfasten her corset, revealing splendid- if impossibly proportional- cleavage, graciously bouncing forward with each button undone.

 The prince’s face- now an almost inhuman shade of red- did as he was told, and unfastened his pantaloons. The witch, now completely naked, stood up, turned around, placed a single knee up on the chair, and reached behind herself to spread her lips in presentation.

 “Now, come on...in you go, My Liege.”

 The prince, hesitant in mind but body completely overwhelmed by hormones and unfamiliar instincts, rushed the witch with the vigor of a stallion and, as if he weren’t a virgin at all, shoved his formidable penis (now rock-hard; he wondered if even his sword could hold up to it, as much as he could muse over with such a foggy mind) into the witch’s pussy. She yelped.

The prince, already out of breath and feeling as if he might faint at any moment, was pumping harder and faster than any stallion he’d ever seen in life. The witch tried to speak, but each time, could only muster out a soft squeak, followed by a low groan.

 “What...what is this fowl magic? I can’t stop...how do I know to do all this?” Prince Abrams was utterly flabbergasted, overwhelmed with raw sexual power.

 “You’re...it’s because, my Prince,” the witch ejected his cock, got into a seated position on the chair, and beckoned him back inside, “it’s because you’re a man, and you’ve never known a woman could feel this good.”

 Seconds after regaining entry, the prince could not contain himself. An alarming warmth and tightness flushed through his groin, and he pinned the witch with so much force that his thumbs could have went right through her ribcage.

 Suddenly, semen- glistening like ivory- ran down the witch’s inner thigh in a single stream after her pussy had been filled to capacity after what felt like a dozen powerful spurts. The prince gasped as his half-erect dick fell out of her, trailing a sparkling thread of his honey. 

 He lost consciousness and fell backwards, falling asleep as soon as he hit those partially-molded slats, his penis slightly curved to the side, a bead of after-cum like the fruit topping a tart.

 The witch let out a final gasp of relief, assumed proper seated posture on the chair, lit a half-smoked pipe of tobacco, and grinned as she gazed down at the inert prince.

 “Well, now...if that didn’t give me an heir to the throne...perhaps your next dozen renderings will...My Prince.”"
morbidquestions,fqdwv5o,t3_gi73bq,1589297989.0,"Let’s break it down.

First of all, it would depend on your public profile. How famous are you? Were you generally liked or disliked by people? Did you have a lot of friends, professional relationships, business connections, big family, etc? Did you stay on top of any social responsibilities like paying taxes and avoiding crime? All these things and more will determine how overall difficult faking your death will be. 

You would need to find a way to have a death certificate generated for you, which would involve a doctor either checking you and seriously believing you’re dead, or being convinced you are without a check (I.e being missing in action, lost and never found, body completely destroyed somehow, etc.). In my opinion, in light of this, the best option one could take would be to do something like cause a huge explosion, or get lost and do a very good job of being not found, so that eventually you will be declared dead (these are *NOT* suggestions).

Second, whenever you “come back” from the dead, you will need to basically become a ghost. What I mean is that you leave *no* evidence that you survived. You will need to wait long enough after funerals and whatnot for people to mourn your “death” and move on, you can’t open any accounts anywhere, you can’t walk around doing things, you can’t drive a car (thus risk being pulled over), you can’t ever go to the hospital for anything, you can’t make money legitimately, and you sure as hell can’t use a phone or get online if you cant be 101% anonymous.

The only way to have a life at this point would be to leave your country of origin in such a way that there is no evidence of your departure (I.e via stowaway, privately hired pilot, crossing borders covertly etc.) and hope that you can register as a citizen elsewhere with a completely fake name, DOB, etc. Oh, it would help to change your hair, visual features, and eye color via contact lenses if possible, too.

Watching crime shows (reliable sources, huh?) have shown me that there are people who do all this dirty work for you, but for a very large sum of money."

*Do not* do this without any witnesses; she will likely try to twist the story and if she is manipulative as she sounds like she is, she will have no problem warping the truth in such a way that it convinces people that she was the poor victim being cornered after being welcomed by a friend.

Good luck, and don’t feel bad about putting the boots on."

AskReddit,fph82x7,t1_fpgraww,1588616619.0,"I have not been banned from r/AskMen but almost every one of my posts has been removed from the automod; almost every inquiry into this has been met with snarky responses or a lack of explanations, simply telling me to ""read the rules"" when at times I carefully made posts specifically ensuring I followed the rules to a ""T"". This still continues to be a problem and it's very hard to get past the automod; and, curiously, the support thread in which people constantly hammered on the automod was removed weeks ago."
AskReddit,fph7mug,t1_fpgnc4y,1588616396.0,"Totally agree. Long before Reddit (i.e., when web forums reigned supreme), the ""mod"" designation for users was basically just a privilege awarded to popular-enough users that granted pardons for rule-bending that would have consequences for regular users, further enhanced by, as you described, the cult-like following of the masses that came with these mods being appointed. 

To me though the mod syndrome on Reddit is worse than it has ever been on most forums, though, because the autonomy that is given to subreddits to basically freely create and enforce their own rules just adds to the fanaticism of some mods and removes the expectation for accountability to anyone but themselves."

AskReddit,fph2wvg,t3_gd9lck,1588614017.0,"When there are a lot of potential tasks expected to be done in accordance to the position you're applying for; I'd say more than 6 total things, especially if ""other tasks as required"" or something like that is included. In my experience this basically indicates that regardless of the nuances of your position, you will be expected to do odd jobs quite a bit (and you can count on them being the things that no one else wants to be doing; i.e. the dirty/tedious work). 

I personally refuse to work on an on-call basis, at least if it's on a non-optional/supplementary basis and I've already been offered something with a full-time schedule. So if I'm applying or interviewing and the interviewer/recruiter says anything that directly conflicts with a proposed schedule (i.e., fine print that suggests an offered schedule is subject to change at any time, or if the interviewer communicates an expectation to skip weekends or work on-call regardless of schedule; if it's not purely for overtime and such), I'll consider it a red flag and give the position more thought and probably move along."

pokemon,fpdf7ur,t3_gcqbq1,1588525816.0,"A regional variant of Growlithe/Arcanine that would actually fit its “Legendary Pokemon” title and would gain a baby form to fill the traditional three evolution slots.

(Baby; No Name Yet)
[Type: Fairy/Normal (or Fire)]
Evolves: When leveled to 20 when at least one evolved Pokemon is in the trainer’s party.

Description: This puppy Pokemon was born the runt of its litter, and was bullied relentlessly by its own siblings. It has willingly exiled itself in order to train and, one day, return home with the glory of a living legend.

Growlithe
[Type: Fairy/Fire]
Evolves: Shiny Stone *or* Level 50

Description: The [region] Growlithe spends its days dashing to and fro, burning away those who do evil things. At night, it stands vigil for those too weak to defend themselves while resting.

Arcanine
[Type: Fairy (or Fire)/Dragon]

Description: When the [regional] Growlithe decided to dedicate its life fighting for good alongside an equally valorous trainer, unspeakable power borne from brazen conviction was unleashed in every one of its cells and it now embodies a dragon and the hero who seeks it."
pokemon,fpdbpag,t3_gchcqs,1588523832.0,"I don’t think it’s so much that the problem is that they’re making it easier but that Gamefreak is trying to appeal to everyone by making a nostalgic game while disregarding the features that veteran players like (I’d argue that we minimally make up 50% of the SS player base).

It’s like it’s tedious in some ways and dumbed way down in others. Everyone liked Mega Evolution but it was scrapped. It’s good that they made EV training way easier (I don’t miss spending a whole weekend SPE and ATK grinding a new Pokemon) but creating so many double-weakness Pokemon, making the gym leaders mostly one-shotable, making the game super linear and overall watering down the campaign story made the game a bit boring and much less rewarding. 

Also the weather system in the Wild Area looks cool and new on the outside, but really it’s just another luck/lottery mechanic that keeps people logging in and hopeful for a new Pokemon to spawn but not actually being in control of anything. Unless they roll their Switch time forward/back but hey it’s the thought that counts."

In college my room mate woke up to me eating Pringles standing in the middle of the room, staring at the ground at like 1 or 2am for a while...sounded downright creepy. 😶

I used to sleep walk all the time and had to do crap like put up ropes with cowbells to tape off stairs so I wouldn’t fall to my doom in my sleep, and making sure I couldn’t open doors leading outside. Was crazy 😂"
