StarWarsLeaks,fqvpliq,t1_fqt9u92,1589682335.0,"this is just my personal observation, but on the press tour, I noticed how genuinely excited John seemed about TROS. I remember him saying in an interview that, the first time he read the script, he stopped to call JJ and thank him for what he'd written for Finn. this got me excited, because I'm a big Finn fan.

then the cast and crew screening happened (a week or so before the premiere, I think), and the press tour continued, and... imho, John seemed less enthusiastic.

and when I watched TROS... honestly, I could see why. having seen the movie a few times now, I can't imagine what might've gotten John so excited that he'd call JJ to thank him. as much as I enjoyed Finn's scenes (I think John had the breakout performance tbh), the character didn't get to do much and didn't have much of an arc at all.

I can't help but wonder if Finn's role was much more prominent (or at least he had more scenes/a stronger arc) but it was whittled away in editing.

I know John talked recently about a scene he and Daisy filmed where Rey and Finn talked about his Force sensitivity. my gut feeling is that a lot more was cut from Finn's arc, as well as from other characters' arcs.

imho this would explain why many of the actors (including John and Domhnall, who we know also had several of his scenes cut) seemed to be less enthusiastic about the movie after the cast and crew screening. I'm sure that first viewing of the finished product was a shock."

StarWarsLeaks,fpqoobr,t1_fpqndah,1588827931.0,"my guess is that Rey may have originally been revealed to have *some* kind of special lineage - she just wasn't a Palpatine.

this is pure speculation on my part, of course, but after reading various theories and thinking it over... I wonder if she may have been Han and Leia's long lost daughter (or maybe Luke's daughter, but I lean toward Han and Leia). tbh I don't think it would even take that much retconning - just reveal in dialogue that she was kidnapped as a toddler and believed dead, and the people who left her on Jakku weren't her biological parents, as she believed, but perhaps caretakers of some kind. and so on.

I'm spitballing here, so it's obviously not perfect. I'm just speculating on how something like that could possibly be explained.

imho it's honestly not that much more outlandish than Rey Palpatine, plus it would explain her connection with Kylo.

side note - we also know (per Bespin Bulletin) that Daisy and John filmed together at Bad Robot in October, just the two of them.

I believe those two only had one or two scenes where they were alone together - one of which was the scene where Rey tells Finn that Palpatine was responsible for the deaths of her parents. it would've also been pretty simple to shoot/reshoot that scene over a couple of days on an indoor set.

you make a good point about Rey's flashback to her parents! I don't have, like, a firm rebuttal lol, just that I think that flashback could've also pretty easily have been changed or added in reshoots.

but like I said, this is all speculation on my part. 😅"
StarWarsLeaks,fpql5li,t1_fpqjlgf,1588825386.0,"hmm, that's an interesting point. I never really questioned whether the dyad might have been a later addition. my gut instinct is that it was always part of the script. but it makes you wonder. 🤔

I still strongly suspect that AD rerecorded the hangar scene, for the reasons you outlined above.

I just think it's a weird coincidence that the one scene that's confirmed to have been rewritten and reshot just happens to be the only one where Rey talks about being related to Palpatine, and the only other scenes that mention it are ones where a masked character says the words and we know the actor rerecorded some lines (though we don't know for sure which ones)."
StarWarsLeaks,fpo9fcd,t1_fpnpco4,1588780664.0,"good question. tbh, as far as I can tell (based on conversations with a lot of casual SW viewers irl and some discussions online), the general audience has accepted Rey being adopted into the Skywalker family and embraces that theme of chosen family, even if her being Palpatine's biological granddaughter left a lot of folks scratching their heads. I don't think it would've made a huge difference except that it would probably be less jarring.

as for the more hardcore crowd - the ones who have been calling Rey a ""thief"" and a ""usurper"" and insisting that Rey being alive means ""Palpatine won"" (which... he really didn't, but...)?

I think Rey Skywalker would've gone over better with some of those fans if she wasn't connected to Palpatine in that way, but the chunk of people who wanted Ben Solo to be revealed as the true hero and protagonist of the ST (instead of Rey) would still be mad. they would just frame their complaints differently - rather than ""Rey can't be a Skywalker because she's a Palpatine,"" it would be something like, ""Rey can't be a Skywalker because she's a nobody."""

StarWarsLeaks,fpli9u8,t1_fplh3et,1588713196.0,"I struggle a bit with the idea of Rey actively killing Kylo, because my personal take on the character is that, in her heart of hearts, she's just not a killer and wouldn't take a life unless she had any other choice.

that said... I really like your idea! she gives him one last chance (which is so Rey, compassionate even to those who truly don't deserve) but he forces her hand... so she finishes it once and for all. I can see it. I think that would be a beautiful and tragic way to end things."
StarWarsLeaks,fpkwtoi,t1_fpktlg5,1588702408.0,"one scenario I liked to play around with involved Rey and Kylo having their final confrontation on a Star Destroyer that's crashing, or a planet that's about to explode, etc - some dire situation that'll kill them both if they linger too long.

after a grueling battle, Rey has defeated Kylo and unarmed him. he's beaten, and they both know it. he waits for her to strike the killing blow (it's what he would do, after all, if the situation was reversed) - but instead, she offers him her hand, one last time.

he hesitates. maybe he even starts to reach for her. but in the end, his pride won't allow him to accept her help - not before, in the throne room, and not now. she showed him compassion, but she has to let him go. you can't save someone who doesn't want to be saved.

she escapes. he doesn't. she chooses life and light, while he chooses death and darkness.

(now that I'm thinking about it... I guess I'm saying I'd like something thematically similar to Admiral Zhao's death in Avatar: The Last Airbender. I thought that was really well done.)

basically, in my ideal world, Kylo's death would be a clear result of his own actions and choices - in this scenario, choosing a proud death over what he would see as disgraceful survival. tbh I think Kylo's pride has always been his greatest flaw (he thinks he's inherently superior to other people, which is why he thinks he deserves ultimate power), so I could see him doing something like that, personally."

you mean TROS? /s (but also not really /s lol)

I guess he does technically redeem himself in Duel of the Fates, in the last moments of his life, when he chooses to restore Rey's life. but I honestly like how it's framed much better than his TROS redemption.

in Trevorrow's version, after Leia reaches out to Kylo, he looks down upon Rey and is described as finally understanding what Vader felt when he watched his son - his family - being tortured by Palpatine. he understands why Vader would turn away from the darkness - and that it wasn't a weakness, as he previously believed, but the greatest strength.

I also think Duel of the Fates does a better job of showing Kylo's inner conflict. in TROS, he's wholly committed to the dark side until a switch flips when he hallucinates Han. in Duel of the Fates, that conflict is woven throughout the story, with a flashback to a conversation with Han, several scenes with Force ghost Luke, etc. each time, he doubles down on his choices, until Leia finally gets through to him.

your mileage may vary, of course! I'm just a big fan of villain Kylo, so it was great to read a script where he gets to truly be himself (as I interpret him, anyway) and maintain his agency."
StarWarsLeaks,fpkm78h,t1_fpkkidz,1588697154.0,"did you happen to read Colin Trevorrow's leaked Ep. 9 script? it has something similar, where Kylo learns how to basically suck the life force out of living things. in the climax, he uses this power on Rey, almost killing her - but when Leia reaches out to him (similarly to how she does in TROS), he has a change of heart and restores Rey's life, sacrificing his own in the process.

I thought it was great, personally. but I guess I just really would've liked to see Kylo struggling to get power over life and death as the ultimate achievement, since that's, like, the inherent conflict between the Sith and the Jedi."

tinfoil-hat territory, sure, but... we know that Adam Driver rerecorded Kylo's dialogue in the hangar scene, where he's helmeted and tells Rey that she's a Palpatine. maybe he told her she was a Palpatine in the original version, too, and they just changed the exact words... or maybe he originally told her something else entirely.

we also know (per Maryann Brandon) that the scene where Rey and Luke discuss Rey's heritage was rewritten and reshot. and if I recall correctly (haven't seen the movie since January), that's the only scene in which Rey actually speaks about being related to Palpatine. she alludes to a grim truth/secret in other scenes, but never speaks of it frankly.

again, I haven't seen the movie in a while so I could be wrong, but if I recall correctly, the one time Palpatine refers to Rey as his grandchild, he's offscreen and we don't see his mouth. that line could've also easily been rerecorded and dubbed over the footage.

I mean, you're still denying things that actually happened in canon material - like Leia holocomming regularly with Ben while he was with Luke, or Ben visiting his home on Hosnian Prime, or the fact that Ben's classmates literally had his mom's phone number.

Ben being totally isolated from his family after going to train with Luke *used* to be canon, as of TFA. but it was retconned. like I said in another comment, Kylo's background has been written and rewritten enough times that it's muddy and hard to tell what his actual motivations were. who is this character, really? hard to say. LFL doesn't seem to care.

but the fact remains that he had contact with his family, he was loved and he was never neglected. he made the evil choices that he did *despite* his family's love, not due to a lack of it. you're the one trying to make your opinions/headcanons into fact.

but sure, let's conveniently call it a night when you can't support your assertions."
StarWarsLeaks,fo4la2h,t1_fo4hvcy,1587506478.0,"I mean, in the book itself, Han is anxious about being away from Ben for the first time and is having a lot of insecurities about being a father (he worries he's not the father Ben deserves and that smuggling is the only thing he's truly good at, etc). but the whole point is that he ultimately realizes that he is cut out to be a father and a husband and that's the life he wants... which you would know if you'd read the book.

Han and Leia did not neglect their son. period. it didn't happen. that's what makes Kylo's fall tragic - that he made these choices despite having a family who loved him and wouldn't hesitate to give their lives for him."
StarWarsLeaks,fo4044e,t1_fo3yr84,1587495905.0,"mm-hmm. it's strange - before TROS, I was so sure that there was a plan. like, at least a basic bulleted list of plot points/character arcs (""Kylo Ren kills Snoke and takes over the First Order,"" ""Luke becomes a Force ghost,"" etc), with the details left up to each writer/director. I just couldn't imagine that they would spend billions on this property and not bother to map it out.

but now it's been confirmed that they really were just making it up one movie at a time - and that whatever character arcs were vaguely planned (like Kylo's) got thrown out. what a disappointment. 😩

totally agree about Leia. I think rewriting the movie around what little unused footage they had was a mistake and a disservice to both Leia and Carrie. personally, I think they should've written her out as much as possible (she could still appear briefly, even as a hologram, and we could hear her voice over the radio, etc, which would've allowed for a voice actor to step in) and let her live. Leia deserved to live on in books, comics, etc.

but apparently the powers that be saw Leia primarily as a ""nurturer"" whose role should be to literally kill herself for the villain. they couldn't imagine anything else for her. I'll never understand it."

I think they wasted Luke/Mark in TROS when they had the chance to really build on that relationship with Rey. (it's actually something I think was handled beautifully in the Duel of the Fates script and I wish they'd kept the concept.)

but at the same time, I remember hearing Mark say that doing Star Wars just wasn't the same without Carrie. his heart wasn't fully in it - and who can blame him?

I don't have the book in front of me, but [here's confirmation from StarWars.com](https://www.starwars.com/news/5-things-we-learned-from-last-shot):

>Daniel José Older’s novel, [*Last Shot*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/568276/last-shot-star-wars-by-daniel-jose-older/9780525622130/), covers that ground and more — also moving into their lives five years after the Battle of Endor, as Han is itching for adventure to take him away from being a politician’s spouse and **stay at home dad**, and Lando is yearning to settle down.

I don't think it's fair to fault Leia for not psychically intuiting that Palpatine had lived and was apparently in some kind of telepathic contact with her son (our knowledge of his contact with Snoke/Palpatine is still extremely limited and vague).

Leia and Han did the best they could for their son. when they found that they weren't equipped to help him control his powers (which made him a danger to himself and others), they sent him to his loving uncle and maintained contact (which we know from Bloodline and The Rise of Kylo Ren). no one could've done more for him."

Rey doesn't mind trick Finn in the junior novelization. in fact, when Rey mind tricks the stormtroopers and Poe wonders aloud if she would do that to her friends, Finn notes that Poe is joking and he knows Rey would never do that to them.

there are some disconnects and inconsistencies like that. but tbh... I like the junior novelization better than the adult one (and I loved the previous junior novelizations by Michael Kogge). I feel like he really gets at the core of the characters."

honestly I think this is an issue with a lot of writers working on these stories without communicating with each other more than anything else.

TFA gives the impression that Han didn't see his son since he first went off to Jedi school... but other material that came out later shows that Ben had contact with his parents during that time. Bloodline shows that Leia used to holochat with Ben (and probably Han, as well), while The Rise of Kylo Ren shows that Ben had his own ship and implies that it was normal for him to visit Hosnian Prime (and he could do so whenever he wanted).

so which is it? Kylo's backstory has been written and rewritten multiple times.

I do wonder how Luke explained what happened on the night of the destruction to Han and Leia. we honestly don't know what he told them, or if he told them anything at all (though Han, at least, knew that the temple had been destroyed - and remember that the destruction story was retconned after TLJ). all we have is speculation, so I don't think it's fair to make judgements about Han's fitness as a parent based on that."

TLJ places Kylo as the BBEG for the final installment, which dovetails neatly with both JJ's and Adam's comments about the character (TFA is about the birth of a hero, Rey, and the birth of a villain, Kylo; the character was pitched to Adam as ""the opposite of Vader"" in the OT, a characters who starts unsure and gradually becomes more and more committed to the darkness, etc).

I honestly think that, after Carrie's death, they couldn't use Collin's script (because she was featured so prominently in it) and didn't really know what else to do with Leia, or with Kylo as a result... so they ended up giving both characters the most cliched ending imaginable."
StarWarsLeaks,fo3ir29,t1_fo3ht60,1587487583.0,"lol so you admit it wasn't even Leia's fault? she left her child in the care of a nanny droid, which then (without her knowledge) left him in the care of the kitchen droid, which was then compromised by a virus that nobody could've foreseen. how does that make Leia neglectful?

it amazes me how some folks on this sub bend over backward to make Leia look like a terrible mother because she had a life beyond her child (because they're uncomfortable with the idea that Kylo was ultimately responsible for his own choices)."

we know now that Snoke didn't plant ideas in his head. rather, Snoke offered him a path to the things he already wanted but didn't feel he could claim on his own (though, of course, Snoek had an agenda of his own)."

yes, it was a kitchen droid. but that would be like saying Leia was neglectful for leaving her child temporarily under Threepio's care, because he's a protocol droid and not a nanny droid.

the point is that you're literally framing Leia as neglectful because she had to let someone else watch her kid for a little while."
StarWarsLeaks,fo3g2eb,t1_fo31vic,1587486295.0,"maybe I need to take off my tinfoil hat, but here's what I'm thinking:

we know, per Maryann Brandon, that they filmed the scene with and without the kiss and did not decide until late in the editing process to use the version with the kiss.

we also know, per JediPaxis, that the original ending of TROS involved Rey and Finn holding hands while watching the sunrise on Tatooine (with Poe and BB-8). it's been confirmed that multiple versions of the Tatooine scene were filmed, so that tracks.

rewatching TROS, I was shocked by just how cruel Kylo is to Rey. he's much crueler to her in this movie than in other two. he really seems to despise her, and she spends the whole movie trying to get away from him. I remember asking myself how it could be that no one at any level of production looked at this movie and thought, ""hey, maybe we should tone this down if they're going to kiss at the end.""

so why didn't they? I honestly believe it's because JJ never intended to use the kiss. that's why the movie doesn't build toward it and why it feels so jarring. (I watched TROS three times in theaters, and each time, the audience laughed. I'd never heard people laugh at a kiss like that in a movie theater.)

I believe that he intended to use the version without the kiss (which probably had the two of them embrace, or maybe even had Rey kiss his cheek or forehead, in a more sisterly fashion)... but unknown events occurred (corporate meddling? who knows) and he was forced to use the kiss, which also forced him to swap out the ending.

so what about the novelizations? well, they were written based on the shooting script (which is why they include deleted scenes - stuff that's filmed but doesn't make the final cut). we know a fair amount about this process because Jason Fry was so open about how things worked when he wrote the TLJ book.

basically, publishing is very slow, which means writing the novelizations has to start while the movie is still filming. by the time TROS hit theaters, the books would've been finished for months. in fact, they were probably already printed.

that's why novelizations tend to be very light on description - the writer doesn't know exactly how actors will deliver their lines, etc, so they try to avoid committing too much to any particular presentation.

(one example: Jason Fry has said that, in his initial draft of the TLJ novelization, he described Rey as being uncomfortable and unhappy in the rain. when he got to watch an early cut of the film to help him finish the book, he was surprised to see that Daisy played Rey as curious and happy about the rain, so he changed that in his manuscript. but please note that neither Rae Carson nor Michael Kogge had the chance to watch TROS before finishing their books - the movie wasn't done nearly early enough for that to be possible.)

in the TFA script, when Rey visits Finn in medbay, it simply says, ""she kisses him."" we know that turned out to be a forehead kiss in the movie. but the language in the script was ambiguous. it was almost certainly the same in the TROS script - ""she kisses him,"" and that could mean a kiss on the lips, the forehead, the cheek, etc. any kind of kiss.

notice how, in both novelizations, the kiss itself isn't described? it's just ""she kisses him."" no references to lips or mouths or anything. just a vague kiss.

the scenes were written that way because, at the time of writing, the authors couldn't be sure of what kind of kiss it was - so they had to write vaguely enough that their words could describe any number of kisses.

sorry for the rant - I've been thinking a lot about this lately lol.

basically, I think the novelizations are vague about the kiss out of necessity (because there wasn't really supposed to be one until very late in the game), and now LFL is slowly backtracking away from it because they've realized it was the wrong narrative choice and made absolutely no one happy."

meanwhile, Kylo expresses consistent contempt for Rey. on the Star Destroyer, he confirms that he's trying to hurt her by telling her she's a Palpatine - and he is satisfied that he's hurt her more with his words than he ever could with his lightsaber. on the Death Star, it's confirmed that he feels hatred for her and that he wants to make her as miserable as he is.

Rey is also described as kissing Finn in the junior novelization of TFA. the same language is used. do you agree that's also romantic?

like I said, if it were supposed to be read as romance, it would be clear and unambiguous in the junior novelization. but it's not.

you know what would make a romance obvious to any children? the word ""love."" it would be so easy to use - in TROS itself, or the adult novelization, or the junior novelization, or even in the BTS featurettes when JJ and the actors discuss the characters. but it's never used. why is that?

it's also worth noting that Kogge and Rae Carson worked together/compared notes when writing their adaptations. she has publicly supported this book. obviously she doesn't think there's a contradiction.

I think it's worth remembering that adaptations like the junior novelizations (as well as picture books, etc) contain the clearest version of the story, boiled down to it's most essential elements, because they have to make sense to actual children. if their relationship was supposed to be a romance, it would be clear and unambiguous in the junior novelization. but it's not, which tells us something.

Rey isn't Leia's daughter-in-law. Leia is Rey's adoptive mother (and was even before her death). that's canon. it's not ambiguous at all.

also, and this is a side note, Rae Carson isn't a romance novelist. she writes YA speculative fiction, not YA romance. I know the young adult demographic is often conflated with romance, but they're distinct things. there's a difference between a novel having romantic elements and being *a romance* (which is its own genre with its own set of conventions, just like scifi, fantasy, mystery, etc).

in the junior novelization, they're described as ""twins of the Force"" multiple times and specifically compared to Luke and Leia. also, Leia explicitly describes them both as her children - one biological, one adopted:

>*Han’s last gift to her was bringing her a scavenger from Jakku who had become like an adopted daughter to Leia ... For all that Leia had endured, the Force had been good to her in the end. It had given her a second opportunity to be a mother ... She felt that Ben and Rey were connected the way she and Luke were connected. Twins not of the womb but of the Force.*

imho the kiss muddies what is otherwise a pretty clear and simple narrative. without it, the spiritual siblings vibe would be even more obvious. I honestly think they were going for a Jacen and Jaina vibe but couldn't stick the landing.

again, they are *explicitly described as spiritual twins and adoptive siblings,* multiple times, and their connection is described as exactly the same as Luke's and Leia's. so unless you're also going to assert that Luke and Leia are romantic soulmates... that angle just doesn't work."
StarWarsLeaks,fo2f6du,t1_fo2edk5,1587460069.0,"I mean, that's basically what happens in canon.

Ben Solo was the person other people wanted him to be. Kylo Ren was the identity he chose for himself as a child and kept secret until he could finally live it. as he puts it in the junior novelization, Kylo Ren is ""his truth.""

kind of a side note, but... tbh I think his turn in TROS would be more powerful if he did it as Kylo, not Ben. I think it would really drive home the theme that you choose your own destiny if he'd been allowed to make the right choice, just once in his life, while also retaining his identity. but that's just me."

StarWarsLeaks,fndxxg0,t1_fncxszr,1586879542.0,"nah. he did a great job in TFA and TLJ, when he had interesting material to work with. but imho he phoned in his performance in TROS. you could tell his heart wasn't in it. and why would it be? every scene was a rehash of a conversation that had been resolved in a previous movie. the character that had so much potential regressed and got the most cliched ending possible. he seemed ready to be done. 

honestly John Boyega gave the standout performance in TROS and doesn't get nearly enough credit for it."
AmItheAsshole,fndu8dc,t1_fncjtce,1586877585.0,"uhh, didn't OP say explicitly that Lucy has been wing-manning and helping him with his new relationship by giving advice, etc? OP said he wouldn't have gotten this far in his new romance with Ellie without Lucy's help. y'all are acting like Lucy is unsupportive when the opposite is true. she's upset because her best friend is hiding her existence like he's ashamed of her."
AmItheAsshole,fndtz0e,t1_fndrpw8,1586877445.0,"lmao what is this nonsense? why would opposite sex friends ""take a backseat"" to new relationships and not same-sex friendships?

yeah, the best way to build your new girlfriend's confidence in your relationship is definitely to hide your best friend for the terrible crime of being a woman. Ellie definitely won't think that's bizarre and a red flag once she finds out. /s

a woman who's uncomfortable with her boyfriend having a close female friend is going to be infinitely more uncomfortable when she realizes he's been hiding the friend from her."
