SuicideWatch,f7e1qbg,t1_f7d3a05,1573642111.0,"yeah, you're right. I think I'm too scared to actually kill myself that's why pills seem so attractive. Cause I guess I don't actually believe they will kill me. I tried to overdose on ibuprofen a few years ago and it did nothing. I guess I'm just grasping at straws here because I just don't know what to do."
depression,f7cexgi,t3_dv1bgx,1573590782.0,I slept for 1.5 hours so I could study for a test that ended up being canceled. I missed another test because I was late. I was thrown out from a workshop at my school and now I have to find another one because they're obligatory. I slept for an entire afternoon. I'm very depressed now.
depression,f7ce8mj,t3_dv3464,1573590349.0,I want to to work in a fire lookout tower for a couple of weeks
Anxiety,f787qh3,t1_f74olii,1573487327.0,"I had the exact same issue with meditating, but I found a method that works great for me. Instead of focusing on your breath focus on your body - how the breath feels like going from your nose to your lungs and out and how your stomach moves. You can experiment with focusing on different body parts and feelings - I usually just think about my nose."
depression,f5ncy5e,t1_f5hn1i4,1572298898.0,"thanks for the response. I don't play minecraft yet, but I'm planning on buying it so I'm gonna give it a try. 

I might try that. I often draw whatever I'm feeling at the moment, usually as a short comics with my thoughts written next to it, like a diary. It really helps me to calm myself down."
SuicideWatch,f5h5piy,t1_f5h1u5g,1572200579.0,"I completely understand, I went through that last year. Good luck! I hope things will get better for you, you deserve that :)"
SuicideWatch,f5gz8wj,t1_f5gvnac,1572198767.0,"That's exactly how I feel! I really want to escape my life and have a fresh start somewhere else. There's a saying/joke in my country ""a gdyby tak rzucić to wszystko i wyjechać w Bieszczady"" which means that you want to leave everything behind and go to a completely new and far away place (literally to Bieszczady Mountains). I relate to that a lot."
SuicideWatch,f5guycu,t1_f5gqaao,1572197480.0,"That's one of my fears, too. What if I fail and become handicapped or paralyzed? Or how would everyone react after my failed suicide attempt? How would I be able to look my parents and siblings in the eyes?"
depression,f5gu14f,t1_f5glzlj,1572197104.0,"I'm sorry to hear that, I googled the crohn's disease and it must be hard, man. Wish you all the best. 

Sure, I don't mind. My main hobbies are art (drawing, animation, painting), video games and music. I'm kinda interested in cooking, hiking and making stuff (like stitches, patches, plush toys etc.) but right now they're just on my list of things I'd like to do."
depression,f5gq7xb,t1_f5glugr,1572195958.0,"Thanks, I'm glad you're better now. I'd love to essentially run away from my life - move and start over, but I can't do that right now, I'm stuck here for at least a year since I'm seventeen. And also I don't think that would really help me, I'm pretty sure I will be unhappy no matter where I am. I kinda did that 1,5 years ago. I went to a new school, met different people, moved to a new town - still feel like shit. That's why I wish I was a different person."
