If you had two baby monitors on the same frequency they would disturb each other and generate noise. Phone and radio blockers block a wide range of frequencies, and since they are made to block the frequencies they generate have to be stronger than the other frequencies. This means you either have about 5m of range and a smaller area around that of noise, or you have a large area, about 20m of blocking and then way more of noise. If you want anything close to blocking all frequencies in your ""private space"", like curtains block the light then you will generate noise far beyond that.
