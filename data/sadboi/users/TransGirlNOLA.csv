The fact that you’ve done so speaks of your intentions. As a trans woman who’s only ever dated cis guys, I think it’s rad!

MtF,fhxbuzi,t3_f527p3,1581950561.0,"I met my ex-boyfriend of over a year on Tinder (and we’ve talked about getting back together). There ARE some gems. 

That said, I have extremely low expectations when it comes to that app. I know my ex was clearly an exception to what seems Tinder’s rule. We didn’t even have sex until our fourth date. A lot of guys seem to just swipe on the first picture they see. A lot also just “swipe right on everyone then sort through matches” according to one guy I matched with and asked. 

I thought Bumble had a bit more depth, but even there I ended up having a great date with a guy, only to have him not actually read my bio until THREE days after our date."

I just wanted SOMEONE to hold Adam. 

Aimee’s assault, sadly, brought up some of my own experiences. I knew she’d break down eventually when she got home. All too relatable. 

Eric’s date was the cutest thing. He’s been long overdue for someone like Rahim. 

All that said, I’m completely over the Otis and Maeve thing. I, for one, think Maeve would be bored of Otis after just a week of dating."
MtF,ffrb4aq,t1_ffra2d0,1580154371.0,"As long as not telling them is mostly YOUR decision. My now ex-husband didn’t want his family and friends to know I was trans. He asked me to basically hide or delete all my pre-transition photos on social media when we got serious. I hated to do so but I loved him. 

It created SUCH a gulf between me and literally everyone I met through him and with him. It made me anxious. We fought every time a friend or family member of his would be our houseguest. It wasn’t until couples’ therapy that I realized it was because my home couldn’t be my sanctuary if people didn’t know that I was trans. So we had a rule that he would have to tell anyone he invited to stay with us. 

Even now that we’ve split, there are STILL people, who have known me for years, who just assume I’m a cis woman. It might sound like a great thing, but I can’t open up or even relax around people like that, so I avoid them, and that’s incredibly isolating at times."
MtF,ffr9t8l,t1_ffr90ud,1580153568.0,"My sister (4 years my senior) is much worse, which is why I don’t even speak with her. 

I began HRT at 29, just a couple months before my 30th birthday. She was well aware, but still mailed me a ‘Happy Birthday Little Brother’ card. 

Fast forward three years, and she misgendered me during dinner with my boyfriend (who became my husband) at the time. I’d warned him before we got out of the car. I told him she would misgender me, and that I wouldn’t correct her because of her proclivity for drama.

I believe in creating my own family, and I’ve done so over the years with some incredible friends."

My response:

“People don’t usually run around thinking of their identity they just ARE. I don’t constantly think, ‘I’m trans. I’m trans. I’m trans...’ or ‘I’m a woman. I’m a woman. I’m a woman...’ like some sort of looped recording no more than I’m almost certain you don’t think ‘I’m a man. I’m a man. I’m a man...’. You’re just you. 😊”"
