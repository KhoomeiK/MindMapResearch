TrueBlood,fogyfh8,t3_g7dcih,1587758413.0,"In season 1 when Sookie first tastes Bills blood, she was severely wounded after getting beaten up by the Rattarays. So she drinks quite a bit of his blood, it heals her and then only after that does she experience residual symptoms (mood, heightened senses). When Jason and Amy, or Lafayette, take V it is only a drop or two and they were otherwise healthy. I will also include that when Jason drinks the vial of V when he is arrested, it is still only a smaller amount. 

My thought process is, if you are otherwise healthy, the V gives you all the symptoms at once as it isn’t being used up to heal. So healing uses up the bulk of the high symptoms, leaving whatever is left of the V in your body to produce the residual feelings Sookie experiences. I’m trying not to spoil past season 2, but there are other instances in the show that I think add to this line of thinking. However I’m sure they contradict this theory at least a few times.

Hope you’re enjoying it! Wish I could watch it for the first time again!

Ok, the case:
Woman goes missing some time in the 1960s, leaving a daughter and husband behind. Father is suspected of her murder for something like 20-30 yrs, daughter never stopped looking and eventually found the mom living just one state away. Mom said Dad was abusive and she just couldn’t take it so she ran away leaving her daughter behind.

I believe it occurred in states closer to middle America (Tennessee to Kansas maybe?). I’ve done some serious google/ ranker searches and have found plenty of other cases, but not this one. The photo attached to her segment in the article is of the mom, a classic black and white 1950-1960 headshot, short curled blonde hair all perfectly placed (almost helmet like). Wish I had more solid info, cuz you guys be sleuthing like pro armchair detectives!

Certainly now (current times) there is a chain of command, a specific procedure for handling, storing evidence; presumably for this exact reason. But prosecution can mishandle, misplace and even purposely delay evidence being submitted to both the defense and the court, but the judge isn’t pissed? If a POI purposely withheld information are they not committing perjury? Is this not the case with LE? 

Not a cop hater, just genuinely confused how very important pieces of an investigation can just disappear with or without malicious intent (see St. Louis Jane Doe, where they sent basically the only piece of evidence to a PSYCHIC, never to have it return again)"

eyelashextensions,ex3nnbo,t3_cragot,1565988409.0,"Retention can be 50/50 on the tech or the client care. The tech could have not used enough glue, the lash extension chosen could be too heavy for the natural lash causing it to “snap” and fall off, taking your natural lash with it, your lashes may have had residue on them which can weaken the bond of the glue, any of these are possible but it could also be the aftercare. Every tech/ training is different in terms of application and aftercare. I suggest to my clients: no water within the first 24 hrs, clean them once a day gently with a mild baby cleanser or preferably a lash bath made for this type of cleansing and a soft brush, pat dry with a paper towel, nothing fibrous such as a bath towel and to brush them gently afterward to keep the lashes from sticking together. Sleep can also be the culprit, specifically the outer lashes, and most likely the side you lean towards once asleep. You may not think you’ve laid on them, you may think that you’re a back sleeper but we move and do things in our sleep; for example a client with retention issues on her left outer corner swore she slept on her back, only to find out from her boyfriend she was rubbing her eyes in her sleep and then turning and laying heavily on her left side! She never would have known or thought of that because she was sleeping. In this case, the other commenter is on the money, those sleep masks are a lash saver! You can get one on amazon for $10.

I understand your concerns and it totally sucks when this kind of thing happens! I would be hesitant to put blame on you or the tech, anything can happen and I wasn’t there.

bipolar2,ewkvz50,t1_ewkrsym,1565496319.0,"I was actually following my therapist’s advice to continue taking risks even if it failed. And I don’t think it was a complete failure, that was the biggest hiccup of the day. 

Maybe for you not going to an amusement park helps with your recovery and I respect that, but I’m trying to move forward with my own recovery using the plan my mental health providers have made with me. People have different paths.

I think I took a step forward FOR my BP, but that doesn’t excuse my friend making kind of a shitty offhand comment. I’m not sure how my “ignoring the risk” of an amusement park justified my friends comment which was the reason for this post. 

Thanks for your advice"
bipolar2,ewknros,t1_ewkm93p,1565489431.0,"I feel you, it’s hard with this particular friend because she doesn’t have a large capacity for emotion or a lot of experience with mental health. I try to be understanding of this which is why I vented here. My other friends (who understand mental health a lot more) have all moved to different states. I honestly don’t even think it registered to her as insensitive, I truly think she was trying to be motivational. I appreciate the support."

UnresolvedMysteries,eogd3dr,t3_bri4xd,1558555507.0,"This case guts me. I know there are other “more deserving” cases, but this case sticks with me. The fact that we will never know who exactly Morgan was because her mother scrubbed her internet presence to what she wanted people to see. Or the fact that even through years of grief, this mother spouts all these far reaching assumptions as facts, STILL. Or maybe the fact that this poor girl was trapped inside her mothers delusions. I just feel for her."
