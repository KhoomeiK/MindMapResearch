Yes it was wrong, but so was a lot of other things people did in the past. We can only acknowledge it and move on and maybe try to do better. 

But what some people are doing today is no different than what they were doing 100 years ago, leaning only towards a specific gender to be a specific way.

Considering that today we're fighting for equality across all fields, it's kind of ironic that we're displaying men and women differently.

What I want to see is balance. I want a good balance of both men and women of all types of archetypes - smart, dumb, weak, strong etc.
