socialwork,fqjau0p,t3_ggtgff,1589407383.0," So I'm not a teacher yet. I have a bachelors in English and am enrolled in a transition to teaching program...but on top of paying for tests I'm looking at 6 months of not being able to work really and one semester of 1 class that I'd have to somehow pay for myself. 

I'm about to apply to a part time, 3 year msw program. Is this worth it?

Some questions:

 I want to work with youth, but I get the impression that social work is flexible in what area you work in and so it'd be easier to get a job than to get one as a high school English teacher.

-they get paid more it seems to me?

-Do you guys get benefits? Vacations? Anything?

- I want to feel like I'm doing something worthwhile and honestly I don't feel that about teaching English. Do you feel you're making a difference?

I'm a bit scared because I worked 1 year in home health care for mentally disabled. I absolutely hated it and don't want to work in that area ever again. What are your jobs like? Counseling, finding resources, etc? I'm afraid I might not be cut out for SW because of how much I hated that job...but I can't not do anything with my life..."

You should definitely try Murkami. If you know anything about the occult or Jungian psychology I feel like his works are full of those types of symbolism. He has a wonderful way of making his world feel normal, relaxing, almost like a slice of life feeling. You don't really question the strangeness when it comes out, you're just like ""oh ok"". With most of his works I get lulled into a dream like state. I've seen other people say the same.

I recommend starting with Kafka on the Shore or the Windup Bird Chronicles. With 1q84 people seem to be pretty divided on love and hate. But those other 2 are usually liked by everyone!"

Maybe I just have a bad attitude and I'm going to be horrible at this But I'm already tired of life so that's how I'm approaching it from the get go. I'll do some extra work my 1st year so my 2nd is easier but after that I'm working my contract. And I won't do sports. I hate sports and all that after school stuff."
unpopularopinion,fiw37az,t1_fiw2862,1582774079.0,"Yeah sounds great honestly. I'm 31 and exhausted being underpaid in retail. I can't even afford insurance. And I support my disabled boyfriend. I know It'll be hard, especially for me. I'm getting through this program and suffering the worst depressive episode I've ever had. It's hard to get out of bed let alone study and think about student teaching in fall (though I'm hoping for an emergency license because I can't not work...). 

But hey, when I become a teacher and get insurance I can finally get some help so.

I'm pretty good at time management and planning so hopefully that'll help me."
unpopularopinion,fivnwt8,t1_fiulr9h,1582764213.0,"Main reason I'm getting a teaching certificate: time off. Plus, I'm basically only good at reading and art and can't imagine working 50 hours a week in retail if I moved up higher than where I'm at now. So...you know. But 2 months off!"
French,fiseptv,t1_fir8wkw,1582683424.0,Any similar bands to this? I really dig it.
unpopularopinion,fiqd7kv,t1_fiq0utd,1582641622.0,"I had a classmate that died at 19 from cf. I watch Stephilee on YouTube who has it. She just started a drug that is extending their lives, so at least there's that."
ankylosingspondylitis,fio0ld8,t1_finzebi,1582573950.0,He has tried the creams and it was fairly ineffective. But then who's to say he got a legit cream with everyone doing it these days. Also. .it's really expensive and I just can't afford to try different ones in hopes one works.
ankylosingspondylitis,fio0gnd,t1_finz5jr,1582573877.0,I see. Probably he'll have to do short term then long I would assume then. Thankyou
ankylosingspondylitis,finy8a9,t1_finta3x,1582572590.0,He has no w2s for the past 2 years and I do not claim him. Also he's fixed so no kids for us thank god. Thanks for the info!
ankylosingspondylitis,finy50x,t1_finw080,1582572538.0,"I don't really know tbh. We're in Ohio, and I'm assuming long term since things are not looking to get better."
ankylosingspondylitis,finrq7m,t1_finq5lq,1582568893.0,He has tried cbd. It did nothing for him. However smoking pot does lol.
ankylosingspondylitis,finrmk3,t1_finqgn6,1582568844.0,"Oh we support Bernie, looks like this might be the year too. I wonder how hard it is to transfer a teaching license to Canada. I will pass this along to him about being vague.

I agree it's ridiculous. To say I ""make too much"" is such a slap. As soon as I stepped into management I lost my Medicaid as well. It's like...excuse me for trying to get a better life. Now I just pray I don't get sick or I'll be getting hospital bills I refuse to pay."
ankylosingspondylitis,finp96r,t1_finoau3,1582567600.0,"Right, that's what I am thinking. I don't really know what he'd say though? That my parents, who he's said are friends of his family and let him stay with them, are also paying for his food? But then won't they want to know their income too? I feel like anything he says they're going to twist it."
disability,finm7d6,t1_finlhm3,1582565851.0,We are only 31 so meidcaire is not a concern...yet. But if he puts me on a disability application wouldn't medicaid then see it and he potentially lose his insurance? When I looked up the income limit for 2 person household it seems that I am over it...I don't know how they think so but there it is.
norsk,fi50oqn,t1_fi502is,1582152372.0,Well at least now i know haha
norsk,fi3poas,t1_fi3ommu,1582124937.0,I keep wondering if 'i am the cheese' is like a Norwegian way of saying 'I'm the bomb' or something. I personally love these wierd sentences. They always make me laugh.
unpopularopinion,fhxjx2o,t3_f4zrxu,1581956058.0,"This is what I, as a poor person, tell myself to try and stop feeling so stressed and tired about money all the time. It does not work."
suggestmeabook,fhe6zih,t3_f2oimi,1581515435.0,Do I read this too long ago to remember it all but the story is something I think about a lot. I'll Give You The Sun by jandy nelson was really good and has 2 pov's and the characters go through a lot of change.
Fantasy,fh39dgv,t1_fh2lzmm,1581266366.0,I'd agree with tawny man being the best but someone's not in them so i can't :(
Fantasy,fgscje9,t1_fgrnv9h,1581080423.0,"Same, but I love ""emo"" characters. Look I get it. He's stupid. He does stupid things and I want to poke my eyes out. But he's just so....I don't know. I just love him so much. He means a lot to me. Did you get the illustrated version of assassins apprentice?"
Fantasy,fgscegq,t1_fgrhndd,1581080299.0,"It's a bit complicated. I think the Robin Hobb reddit has a map of the reading order. I would say that the liveship trader and the dragon keeper books can be read as their own 2 series. I read dragonkeepers first, not knowing they were connected to the Fitz books. Same with the liveship books haha. Then I got my shit together and started with assassins apprentice. 

A lot of people love the liveship books the most but I do think you miss out not knowing things from the fitz stories. Fitz's books are my favorite but I think I'm in the minority."
Fantasy,fgrd76z,t1_fgqz0qv,1581043941.0,Yeah Fitz really feels like a personand i fucking love him so much.
Fantasy,fgpstts,t3_ezub68,1581011323.0,"I scrolled a bit but not all the way through the comments, so this might have been suggested.

As far as writing my favorite author is Robin Hobb. Check out her realm of the elderlings series. I've been told some people don't like it because the writing is more literary and therefore ""boring""."
unpopularopinion,fgmwybo,t1_fgmu405,1580933608.0,"You were told wrong. You need to just apply, you don't need a social worker. My bf has a chronic condition and gets medicaid. Thank god cos his meds are 6k a month. You need to apply."
AskReddit,fgdl5hr,t1_fgcuonx,1580683650.0,Immersive daydreaming. I believe there's a subreddit
notliketheothergirls,fgdfwxo,t1_fgcxle3,1580682025.0,"Its more like ""the universe"" didn't want to help you, in some cases. In other cases it's more of a psychological thing. Like, ""you didn't really subconsciously want that, so it didn't happen"", but those people use witchcraft more as self help. There's a lot of ways to look at witchcraft.

I'm going to regret commenting I fear."
