It deals with the fact that unbaptized children haven‚Äôt committed any actual sin, but still have the stain of Original Sin on their souls. God isn‚Äôt going to punish them with Hell, but Justice demands that they not enter into Heaven.

I‚Äôm fine with the fact that my miscarried child is in a state of natural happiness for now."
