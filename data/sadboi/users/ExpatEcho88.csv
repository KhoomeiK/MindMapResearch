That means so far the death rate is 6/16 (38%). That's pretty high... It's also too small of a sample but if you calculate the same way in South Korea (39%), Iran (37%), and Italy (31%) you get similar rates. Japan's is lower. Today 5/37 rounds to 14%. France is

I explained to the police that my brother had created a violent home life for me and that I would like to press charges because I need this to stop so that my baby and I would have a safe place to live.

Meanwhile, I went to urgent care to get my face sown up. 

Did you know that the rate at which police officers are a party to domestic violence incidents in their family lives, far exceeds the rate of domestic violence in the general public? There is no doubt that this affects the way that they respond to police calls involving violence against women (including incidents of rape and domestic violence.) Let me tell you, I have most definitely cut my brother out of my life, as well as anyone who wanted to blame me as a victim of gender-based violence. Is it easy? No, it sure as hell isn't. But we have to be careful who we let into our circles. Sometimes that can mean that we have to exclude or take a break from family.

This is why I am afraid to go to therapy. I don't want to get a diagnosis because it functions as a harmful label that can hold people back in life based on how they're treated for it. I study sociology, so I'm drawing this from labeling theory from that field."
CPTSD,f8e6fa0,t1_f8djq83,1574519934.0,"\>Labeling a minor with cPTSD or DTD would require our systems to be able to prevent further trauma and that is not gonna happen anytime soon.

So true. Instead, when they act out we lock them up. In the USA at least. Nearly 100% of juvenile justice-involved youth are survivors of multiple serious traumas. (I think the actual statistic is 98%.) On average, they report 7 major traumas."

Totally forgot my mom used to ALWAYS say this."
rapecounseling,f8e4q5i,t1_f8e3xnx,1574518562.0,"Yeah, and it doesn't help that victim-blaming is seemingly so widespread in society. We need exactly the opposite, to know that it wasn't our fault, that we deserve better, and to be able to trust ourselves and our intuition. So anyhow, it's not just you, and that girl was dead wrong and she could very well have to find that out the hard way."
rapecounseling,f8e3szo,t3_e0htqo,1574517898.0,"Jeez, I'm sorry. Who knows what that girl's problem is. I'm currently struggling in grad school from cptsd. I'm sorry that you have experienced that too, but I also appreciate you sharing your story. There's some consolation for me in knowing it's not just me. That in a way it's a normal reaction to a very bad experience or set of experiences. Even though fortunately we can find ways to heal and function again."
rape,f8e2wrv,t3_e0gni8,1574517237.0,"There are techniques for remaining present in the body and working through those moments, but you are her boyfriend, not her therapist, so it's not your job to try to fix her and it's important not to cross that boundary. What is your girlfriend doing to recover from her trauma? Hopefully, she is finding ways to work on it, whether through therapy or something else. I agree with the other poster to remain patient and gentle and give her time."
rapecounseling,f8ayho9,t1_f8aijz0,1574418848.0,"I mean, define anonymous. People with the right know-how can figure out who you are on any platform, and whenever you put something online there is always a record of it even if you delete it. So by that standard, no platform really can be anonymous. But with a fake user name and limiting the use of identifying information, most people can't."
rapecounseling,f8a5jci,t1_f89xran,1574388301.0,"Yes, thank you for the clarification. Although Reddit is also anonymous... And presumably, you could do research using existing platforms. Especially on anonymous platforms like Reddit, where posts are publicly readable.

I personally like that we survivors can interact here while remaining anonymous. That way we can support each other. I like giving and receiving support from other survivors. I find it healing. I suppose others might prefer to be able to share their story without comments though. Glad to hear that you will be supporting some members privately."
rapecounseling,f89oxg7,t3_dzjog7,1574376894.0,I get why you would want to do this. You get to build a business and conduct research. But why will this be good for survivors? What will it provide that other platforms like Reddit don't already offer?
sociology,f84xmiv,t1_f84dhw2,1574263106.0,"Hi, I did discuss this with my supervisor yesterday, and she was very helpful. I'll DM you for the list. Thanks"
sociology,f84xjor,t1_f841z71,1574263055.0,"Thanks, I don't think it continually retraumatizes me. I think I am finding this particularly challenging because of the recent death of my Aunt. My supervisor has given me the opportunity not to continue the project, but I am choosing to. Whether I switch to a different research direction after this study is something I will re-evaluate after the conclusion of this project. I am looking at it as an opportunity to be diligent about self-care and understand/work through the trauma. Avoiding the negative feelings can lead to PTSD and other issues anyways, so I have decided that I prefer to work through them at this point."
sociology,f83mndb,t1_f82k12b,1574215453.0,">but whenever I sat down to work on something different I kept coming back to the underlying questions that got me interested in the topic to begin with.  I realized it wasn't going to be any easier to get back to work on something different than it was to get back to work on the original topic.  A big part of the barrier was just needing to deal with my loss.

I definitely relate to this. Thanks for your comment."
