BPD,eueenhf,t1_eudxw8n,1563742468.0,"I'm dealing with the same issue, sometimes I feel fine and sometimes I feel really sick and BPD is striking back. That's why I never had the courage to get some help, so I waited till the next ""bigger breakdown"" and now I'm in a clinic. I'be been waiting way too long. BPD can come in phases and it can collaborate with other disoders, depressions etc. (in my case histrionic personality disorder). Now I'm inpatient sice two weeks and i've learned that when I didn't felt emotional instability, it were histrionic actions that were bothering me. I just want to say, it's great that you are joinig AA but to kick BPD in the ass you got to see an therapist. Ups and downs are part of the illness."
