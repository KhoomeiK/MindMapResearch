She likely worked really hard to get accepted and you’re just shitting on that.


She probably sees you denying her this as disrespectful and as you failing to acknowledge that she’s smart and capable of making her own decisions. You decided to be selfish and patronizing instead of supportive of your ADULT daughter. Rethink how you’ll relate to your daughter once she starts to resent you for denying her the greatest opportunity in her life. I really hope she goes because going to that school will change her life for the better.

It does sound like you maybe, in order to salvage the relationship, got pressured into the deep self-reflections and into exploring/accepting nonmonogamy. You dove into the deep end too quickly without the proper tools or training. And it also sounds like maybe you were associating becoming nonmonogamous to a higher level of self/to gaining more self-esteem. All kinds of relationships are valid and one is not better than the other. This is all determined by an individual basis. But you’re not better or cooler or sexier if you’re nonmonogamous, poly or monogamous. This is a cliche, but it’s true: your self-esteem has to come from within and not from the choices you make to please others. You just need to worry about what you want, and if you have the same outlooks as your partner(s). It’s ok to disagree and it’s ok to say “we are not for each other and we have to go our own ways.”


You have to build a solid foundation for yourself in order to grow.
