CPTSD,fqxkhkq,t1_fqxitkb,1589733702.0,Doctors can be real assholes for some reason. The more I learn about them the more I feel it attracts people who enjoy the feeling of status and importance it gives them and not so much about caring for people. Because they can be arrogant fucking dicks a lot of the time.
CPTSD,fqxjrtt,t1_fqxj6md,1589733387.0,Wololo
CPTSD,fqx79ev,t1_fqx6khd,1589727352.0,"The program itself is good but the NHS and healthcare system is shit. Free yes, but shit. In fact that's probably why it's bad, it's so overstretched and really difficult to get good help. They do as minimum as possible and you have to really push to get what you need. 

Edit: the program is okay-ish with some awful aspects. I forgot how erroneous the questions they ask are to mental health especially cptsd. It goes about as deep can you leave the house, learn basic tasks or stick to a routine. While ingnoring everything else that doesn't fit this very narrow lens of capabilities."
CPTSD,fqx3x8b,t3_gldy5t,1589725231.0,"When I was applying for disability benefit (in the UK it's called limited capability for work and work related activity) one of my doctors told me I should have applied with ""chronic depression""...  yeah, after I had fucking told him I had complex-ptsd and BPD due to an extremely abusive childhood and broke down crying in his office.  Then went and got diagnosed by a psychiatric team and he says ""I would have put chronic depression"". WELL I DON'T FUCKING HAVE CHRONIC DEPRESSION THEY SAID I HAVE PTSD AND BPD. Seriously doctors are given way too much status they have such a shallow understanding of mental health."
trance,fqwik9s,t3_glarvw,1589705720.0,And now look at us :(
CPTSD,fqru7on,t1_fqqsl0b,1589591994.0,Borderline personality disorder. It's very similar to cptsd so I get what you mean but i'm sure i have it. I have all 9 criteria
zerocarb,fqq5e6m,t1_fqpyi6j,1589559689.0,"It seems to be particularly common with older people, they've built their entire lives around beliefs and to find out their worldview was all wrong must be pretty hard. Probably has something to do with neuroplasticity aswell."
CPTSD,fqq3i6g,t1_fqpx3gy,1589558768.0,"Eh, it's not so bad. The highs are just as intense as the lows after all. I think it makes it hard to love people though because of how totally captivated and obsessed you become with someone, and it never quite feels understood or shared."
zerocarb,fqpwzot,t3_gk7pb0,1589555510.0,I get this exact thing. I think it just exposes their own inadequacies and makes them feel inferior to you. Are any of them overweight or insecure about themselves? Don't let them hold you down.
CPTSD,fqpg1ey,t1_fqpfbon,1589545456.0,I'm much better behaved these days. Video game marathons aren't exactly the best way to spend my time but it keeps my mind off of other shit. The crazy reckless stuff  was really just a phase after I had left home and had lost everything in life. I also have BPD so you can imagine lol.
CPTSD,fqp7wby,t1_fqp6jje,1589538195.0,"You must feel a sense of freedom from doing this too. I think it's part of the reason I engage in drug use and reckless behaviour, the lulz."
Warthunder,fpchwx2,t3_gcn4e9,1588501251.0,This is gay and you are gay.
trance,fp7mqhh,t3_gbsath,1588373568.0,Trance in its purest form.
CPTSD,foa24wk,t3_g6f33g,1587637821.0,"Preparing to sleep is when the pain comes back. I contemplate my life and ruminate over the past, trying to explain and understand it. But at the same time yea I know what you mean, I withdraw from the world and become more in touch with my inner self."
CPTSD,foa0w82,t1_fo9y4gv,1587636869.0,I used to do this until I learned cannabis suppresses REM sleep. Along with vaping it made me dehydrated and I would wake up having to pee so I don't do that anymore.
zerocarb,fnfbs7f,t1_fnf9g5t,1586905085.0,No but I'd looove to get my hands on wild boar. Since even pastured pork is supplemented with grains and I feel more comfortable eating naturally.
zerocarb,fnf1343,t3_g17cuw,1586899474.0,Pork makes me feel gross and it's only the salt that makes it nice. Grain fed meat has no place in my diet
buildapc,fms1ha1,t1_fmryxna,1586343327.0,Okay just did.
buildapc,fms1cb8,t1_fmrz3w5,1586343182.0,"Yea I get it, but what bothers me is that it was advertised as being in stock and given a delivery date which are both false."
trance,fmktfjj,t3_fvw702,1586167971.0,"Absolutely love this one, such an uplifting vibe."
Minecraftbuilds,fmhoslu,t1_fmhodr2,1586088717.0,Yes!
zerocarb,fl66ytf,t1_fl5ychv,1584856537.0,"Thanks, I was thinking it had something to do with water weight and yes as it turns out there's only 150g of protein in my 500g of beef. Meaning 250g of protein will be 1000 calories and the same weight of fat will be just over 2000, giving me the 2:1 ratio! So the correct thing to do is forget the weight of mince and just go by the amount of protein it's giving me, sorted."
zerocarb,fl66qj3,t1_fl61b1d,1584856302.0,I don't see why not if it roughly fits the macros.
BPD,fjd11x0,t1_fjcozop,1583242965.0,"This is the truth. BPD doesn't mean the things you perceive aren't there, it means you feel them much more intensely and deeper than other people. My mother literally says she doesn't trust my perception on things and uses it to downplay and invalidate my concerns and issues. It fucking sucks."
MotoUK,fgimanq,t1_fgikyy6,1580825656.0,">Blink XT2

No a much cheaper one xD. Mine has audio alert so it notifies me whenever it detects motion.  The video is a little vague because it's cheap but definitely a nice piece of kit to have."
MotoUK,fgie3c3,t3_eyjgbk,1580818532.0,I use a motion detecting camera that automatically saves a video clip whenever it detects motion. You can get them quite cheap on amazon. Also how the fuck did they pull this off without attracting attention? Makes me worried about my own bike.
darksouls3,favswod,t1_fauxfv1,1576361871.0,The sad truth. Pontiff is an utter salt fest
zerocarb,f8utilb,t3_e2cirt,1574843430.0,Everything an animal needs will be found in its tissue.
zerocarb,f8tzhro,t3_e242k0,1574815197.0,"For me, it's blue stilton cheese. It has such an intense flavour that's much smoother than the sharpness of something like mature cheddar."
trippy,f7bwu4h,t1_f7aqx94,1573579402.0,How is that even remotely the same experience..
Warthunder,f5m4ek4,t1_f5m47n2,1572286389.0,Just roll around killin' shit
PlantBasedDiet,f59qbld,t1_f59q3g8,1572093812.0,Why?
PlantBasedDiet,f59gn2v,t1_f59gg6e,1572088391.0,Well can you show it to me? How can meat be the problem if it's the sugar that mutates the cholesterol?
darksouls3,f30if1q,t3_df2wo5,1570555079.0,"Looks like i'm safe then, thanks everyone. I'll post if something happens."
darksouls3,f30hxs4,t1_f30hqx7,1570554783.0,So i'm freaking out over pretty much nothing?
darksouls3,f30hqht,t1_f30hfik,1570554656.0,"No it was just some fully upgraded weapons and siegbrau's, stuff like that."
darksouls3,f30hhmc,t1_f30hdzr,1570554503.0,He gave me 66 soul of a great champion. Also his milwood bow was rapid firing when we fought.
battlestations,f2721pl,t3_dc9d7b,1570028968.0,"Ah, a man of taste then."
zerocarb,exmjpv5,t1_exmj5xg,1566433330.0,How is something as concrete and pervasive as OCD cured by quitting smoking if it was never caused by smoking in the first place. And liking things to be neat and tidy isn't OCD.
BPD,exl6mag,t3_ctgc5x,1566407003.0,"Substances and masturbating will give you a hit of dopamine that rebounds when you aren't doing them. That is part of the reason you feel so empty, and probably foggy during the day. Believe me I fell into the same destructive habits and quiting will allow you to revert to baseline again."
zerocarb,exkwzm3,t1_exkrny3,1566400957.0,Then you didn't really have obssesive compulsive disorder...
Warthunder,exard0k,t1_exapety,1566114101.0,I agree!

Minecraft,ew5apl5,t3_cmqb2o,1565131713.0,Tasteful.
insomnia,ew4pqku,t3_cmszyp,1565115716.0,"Remember taking too much and tripping balls on it hahaha... those shadow people scared me though.

It worked good, just didn't feel great the next day. It also creates a strong dependence so only take it if you absolutely need to."
CPTSD,ew4oe2g,t3_cmo6f5,1565114908.0,"I'm just obsessed with trance music, it's just such a beautiful expression of emotion. Connecting with a trance song is a deeply personal and profound experience, without the limits of conventional music as trance is all self interpreted.

CPTSD,eukvq4d,t3_cgtbpm,1563893707.0,"Whenever I get in situations like this, and I've had plenty of them, although probably cared less about them. I try to remember that it's really not the end of the world and there's always another path that's open for you."
Warthunder,euk1xtk,t3_cgq3kf,1563882062.0,The BF109 Emil series are unparalleled energy fighters at 2.3. - 3.0 yet with very competitive manoeuvrability for BF109s.  Dual MGs in the nose and cannons in the wings makes easy killing.
BPDmemes,euj9vzb,t3_cggpdn,1563866193.0,Little mean :(
Warthunder,euj9kbl,t3_cgn7nu,1563865945.0,I never liked the add on armour though. I play with mine off just because it's more fashionable which is always the most important thing tbh.

Minecraft,eqtwogh,t1_eqtw95i,1560320997.0,Yea I think that's the problem here rather than the block i'm using. It's the latest dokucraft pack cause I couldn't find one for 1.14.
