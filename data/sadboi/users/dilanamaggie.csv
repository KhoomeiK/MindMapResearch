Anxiety,etijdm6,t3_cbuo6i,1562851851.0,"It will always suck to be intensely anxious, but just keep reminding yourself that you’ve made it through before. There is absolutely another side, and I promise you will get there. Deep breathing always helps when you’re in the thick of it.  When you deep breath it signals to your brain that your not in immediate danger, and so it starts to chill out little by little. You can do this, my friend. I promise."
