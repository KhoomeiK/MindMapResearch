Depending on the field, their choice is the only choice and any other choice is garbage. Consult the person you are getting the gift for. If they don't completely know what they want let them consult the experts and let them come to the conclusion of what will work best for them. 

And remember that more expensive is not always better. Some times the cheap stuff will do everything the person wants it to. There is also personal preference that goes into that.

>What other example is there of the bible that a angel had sex with a woman?

I never said angle. I said spiritual being. God made a women pregnant. I know that's not the same thing since he has the power to creat life. But I was using that as a statement. You were just mentioning it was nonsense because it sounds ridiculous. So I was making the point that this sounds ridiculous as well, mostly to non believers and skeptics, 

>the book of enoch isn't a metaphor lol, you're trying to twist it to make it fit

There are plenty of parts of the Bible that aren't meant to be taken literal and many parts that have been mistranslated causing confusion and debate. So I wouldn't think it's far fetched for one to think that was possible here. 

>I'm not sure why you are having trouble realizing that the book isn't real, do you like the stories in it or something?

I don't think I claimed anywhere that I knew it was real. I can't even say that for certainty for the entirety of the Bible. I'm still just relearning everything. And yes I did like the story. It was very interesting. 

>You have yet to provide any reason why we should give it any weight. 

At the time of reading it I didn't know if it was true or not. But from what I had come to understand was it was known to writers of the Bible and was in the teachings at one point. And there is a quote from it in the Bible, and other religious text that I actually don't know anything about. 

>The bible says that seth's seed line procreated with women outside their seed line,

At the time that I last researched any of this, which was some time ago, this didn't seem to be the common view point. But I do believe you on that and thank you for teaching me this.

I didn't really know much about it at the time of reading. I had just heard others mention it and say it was worth a read, they never went much more in depth than that. I agree it was worth a read for me and I found it very interesting. And it would be wonderful if it was true to see and learned what Enoch did in the story. It would be interesting to know where the writer got his inspiration for it and why he wrote it. 

Like I said I'm still finding my way through all this and am just trying to learn and have some fun on the way, because a lot of this really isn't much fun, interesting, but not fun for me."

Christianity,fpri88u,t1_fprglqc,1588854809.0,"I've straight up answered this multiple times. But I'll try to be even clearer. Jesus said the first greatest, most important, commandment is to love God with all your heart, all you soul, and all you mind. This was him summarizing and simplifying the first four commandments. In that one sentence he was saying you shall not have any god other than the LORD, you shall not make or worship idols, you shall not use the LORD'S name in vain, and keep the Sabbath holy. 

So saying it as straight up as I possibly can, no. What Jesus says does not over ride the ten commandments. What he said was in agreement with then ten commandments. He is saying the same thing, but using different words. What he said in those two commandments that he said are the most important is equal to and is the same thing as the ten commandments. Those first two that God gave us, plus the next two, are covered in the first one that Jesus gave us."
Christianity,fprfea1,t1_fprdkb6,1588852641.0,"These are the commandments Jesus said were the greatest, meaning most important. You can read it in Matthew 22:36-40.

With this he was summing up the ten commandments when a lawyer was testing him. They were trying to get him to pick one so they could fight him about it. But he was too smart for that. 

Loving God with all you hear, soul, and mind means can't be any love left to give to any other god or idol. This covers all the commandments that have to do with other gods. So they all still apply, he just simplified it. So it it's still meant to be interpreted the same way. And in Buddhism you don't need to and from my understanding shouldn't be worshipping any gods or idols. 

Then the second part he gives is love you neighbor as you do yourself. Again here he was simplifying the rest of the commandments. So all of the Ten commandments still apply, he just simplified them into two which he called the greatest or most important.

I don't know where I was being pedantic, it was not my intention. As far as I see I am loving (treating) you as I do (would) myself. If I was to misunderstand what someone was saying or notice what they said isn't quite right, I would hope that they would take the time to better explain it to me. So that is what I did."

So Jesus gave us two great commandments to follow, even though they weren't his only. These are the two he said are the greatest. Love thy God with all thy heart, all thy soul, and all thy mind. And love thy neighbor as thyself. The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments -Matthew 22:40.  These two summarize  the Ten commandments."

I don't believe that demons knocked up humans. But we do have an example of an immortal spiritual being getting a woman pregnant in the Bible. A lot of things sound like nonsense in the Bible. So much so that many don't want anything to do with Christianity. 

If you're only reason that it shouldn't be read along side the Bible is because one part sounds like nonsense, then that's not a very good argument.

And Jesus didn't come up with the ""Golden rule"". He just simplified it. It was already a part of the Torah, just in many more words and a lot more complicated.

But if you sit in one spot every game weather or not your helping the team, you do kinda suck.

And I also want to say camping at an objective is different. If you are there defending it, that's okay. If you are sitting there not capturing it just waiting for easy kills, again, you kinda suck."

Then I get thrown into one of these maps and now my play style isn't working anymore, so I have no choice but to change things up. And now the game is starting to be more fun again. 

I've had to try different load outs and weapons I'd normally skip over. And sometimes it's humbling to be stomped out. It also makes me realize the game isn't 100% skill. On these maps you see its a small part luck of the draw. Mainly with the spawn points. But just to a small degree."

PSVR,fo4y7qn,t1_fo2aoxq,1587513561.0,"People are saying that is pretty much how it looks. But a video can't do it justice. The video is like looking at an image of an item. In VR it's like actually looking at the item. You get so much more depth in VR. At some point you will reach out and try to touch something because it looks and feels like you could touch it. 

The quality is lower. But if you get it all adjusted right and spend some time in there, the lower quality wont be much of a thought. If you immerse yourself in the game you will start to feel like you are in that world. It's a pretty awesome experience. 

Another thing you can do with the PSVR is use it as your TV. So if you want to sit back and watch Netflix or play your other non VR games you can. It's like sitting in a theater with a big screen. Also if you have other devices hooked to the TV and someone want to use it, you can put on the VR set and continue on the PS4 while they use the TV."

Showerthoughts,fnuveb9,t1_fnurz3w,1587272113.0,"Okay I've just been trying to keep it simplistic, but if you want to get pedantic I'll try to drag this out with more words to better express what I'm trying to get at. 

I'll start with the Karen label I gave to her character in the show Tiger King. And by her character I mean the way she was portrayed in the show. The character she played in the show is not a true reflection of her. Rather it was a portrale of her as part of the narrative the show wanted us to see. The show did not want us to see the real Carol. They wanted us to see a Karen type character that the people could get behind of not liking. I am not saying that Carol is a Karen. I am saying that the makers of the show removed part of the human known as Carol and replaced it with a Karen type personality for the purpose of a show that was meant mostly to entertain and make money rather than depict the true reality. 

So she is not, and I wasn't saying she was, a Karen type person. The show took her and made her a Karen type character because they are smart enough to know that it would be entertaining and get more people talking about the show Tiger King.

Next, the her making money off of big cats statement. I did say she was not doing it in the same way, but I'll over explain that as well. 

Big Cat Rescue makes money by allowing people to come and see rescued big cats. It is an organization that rescues big cats, like tigers and such. They rescue these big cats from people who abandon and/or abuse big cats. They also advocate that big cats are not meant to be breed and sold for our entertainment. Doing such things cost money. Feeding, housing, and taking care of big cats cost money. Rasing awareness and lobbying for better treatment for big cats cost money. The money has to come from somewhere. So big cat rescue charges money, not unlike the other places, so people can see these animals. They sell tours and merchandise to make money. Carol is also on social media, where she also likely makes money, to help promote and raise awareness for the cause. That cause being better treatment of big cats and to stop the breeding, selling, and buying of big cats. Now I never did say where that money was going before, as I didn't think it was necessary because the fact is money is being made off of the big cats anyway you want to look at it. But with Big Cat Rescue, the money that is being made off of the big cats, is being used to help the rescued big cats, tigers and such, and to help promote and raise awareness to the cause of getting better treatment of big cats and to stop the breeding, selling, and buying of big cats. 

So they are using money made of off big cats to end money being made off of big cats."
Showerthoughts,fnulz9b,t1_fnuihxq,1587265290.0,"Hey we're on the same side here. Maybe you misunderstood or a misspoke. I wasn't trying to say she was doing the same thing. That was more about how here character came off. She just seemed like the Karen type like I'm better than you even if we did the same thing. 

She was making money off of big cats just like the rest. But she wasn't doing it in the same way. She was doing it because these big cats can't go anywhere else and shouldn't be used like the others where using them. She has a good cause trying to stop the breeding and selling of big cats. 

She came out after the ""documentary"" came out saying the show did her wrong and made her look bad. I agree with that. I don't know how she is in real life but I believe what she is doing is a good cause. But that made her seem like, this is my thing and nobody else can have it. 

The worst things they made of her in the show was she killed her husband and took the ex families money. From my understanding is the ex family wasn't going to get any of that money because the husband didn't want them to get any of it. But Carol gave them some of the money anyway. And her killing the husband could happen, bit doesn't seem all that likely. He was a real dirt bag himself with very deep pockets and could have gotten out of there many different ways."

When I finally watched the show I wasn't sure I was seeing the same thing as everyone else. I saw Joe as a great TV character, but a horrible human that deserves to be looked up. And Carol more like a Karen, she thinks she's better than everyone else even though she does the same thing. But overall I didn't see her as the bad guy. She was probably the best one out of all of them."

quityourbullshit,fnkez0z,t1_fnk329h,1587024543.0,"My ex had a wobbly cat. The vet said he'd never be able to jump, run, or even use a litter box. As a kitten it seemed like that might be true. But he slowly started learning from her other cat. And as he got older he was able to do almost everything a normal cat could, just with a wobble to it. 

His jumping was highly inaccurate most of the time, but he would get up wherever he wanted. His running was very heavy footed and legs spread about as far as they could go. Kinda looked like those videos of when someone puts booties on an animal. And sometimes when he used the litter box he would hang his ass over the side and shit on the floor. But all in all he was able to live a normal life.

The worst part though was he couldn't always control his claws. Sometimes he would run through the room and a claw would come out and stick to the carpet making him flip over himself. And when he jumped up on you, all claws would come out. If he got you, you usually had to remove the claw yourself because he wouldn't retract them. The cat's name was Totter."
LifeProTips,fnizp5h,t3_g1xfu6,1586989258.0,"From my real-world experience, you be very polite or very rude to get what you want. I'm a very polite person. If I'm nice and calm and stay patient the problem is usually fixed. It happens when in person and not in person. And if you are very rude you will usually get what you want if it's done in person in places that have customers constantly coming and going, like restaurants. But they are less likely to get what they want if it's not in person, like over the phone. 

You're also more likely to get what you want from a small business if you are nice, than if you are rude. More likely to get free meals at fast food places if you are rude. 

This comes from me being a very polite person to workers and dating someone that was very rude to them."

mentalillness,fmz6dyi,t3_fy0nhe,1586508187.0,"Psychosis causes visual and auditory hallucinations, and delusions as well. I have bipolar with psychosis. I see and hear things that aren't there. Some times it's terrifying things like people hiding in my walls and talking about how they are going to hurt me, and sometimes it's normal things like having a conversation with a family member. While it is happening, it is real and there is know way you could convince me other wise. But when it's over some of it I can figure out it's just not possible that it really happened. I've resorted to straight up asking people if this or that happened, because part of it just didn't make sense. It can be hard to know what's real and what's not at times. I've had conversations with people I know, then go to continue on that conversation at a later date and they have no idea what I'm talking about because that first conversation never actually happened. 

You may want to talk to someone if you think you are at risk of hurting yourself or someone else. I had talked to some one at one person because I started killing everyone I knew and myself in these hallucinations. It can be a very scary thing to go through. Talking to someone can help. And if you have someone close that can keep you in check, even better. It's horrible going through it on your own with no one knowing you are going through it or understanding how to help."
