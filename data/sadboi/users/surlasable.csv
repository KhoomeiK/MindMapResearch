vipkid,fhiuzfm,t3_f34elz,1581632369.0,Honestly I always think that‚Äôs the hardest part. =.= I had the exact same fears. But you got this!
vipkid,fhgjo8h,t3_f34elz,1581568989.0,"I have a severe mental illness and like to think I do pretty well in VIPKID! As long as you are being treated and feel you have a handle on your anxiety (and if you have them anxiety attacks) I think you can definitely do it! It might be hard at first, but especially after your first couple classes it gets so much easier. I feel so much more at ease then when I started. I also think that it being over the web does a lot to help with social anxiety. It‚Äôs a lot less intimidating than it being in person. When I was super nervous at first, i focused on the slides or sometime my own face and it helped. I think you should go for it!"
vipkid,fh92a25,t3_f1m2wi,1581372191.0,Thank you for all your responses! Glad to hear üòÅ

schizophrenia,f8cddbg,t1_f8aiobs,1574457875.0,Haha yeah sorry I meant pay someone to administer a test‚Äî if they pass they get registered. Sorry that didn‚Äôt come out clearly. Yeah if they say just pay to register it‚Äôs totally a scam
schizophrenia,f8agbsa,t3_dzvmyn,1574396498.0,I know you can actually train one yourself and then pay to get them registered! It‚Äôs supposed to be hard but I‚Äôm actually going to try to do that myself.
schizoaffective,f86plzn,t1_f86mkhi,1574303871.0,"That‚Äôs true. Don‚Äôt let it define you‚Äî it‚Äôs a part of you and a only small one at that. There‚Äôs so many things that make you unique and special, so don‚Äôt let it be the only thing about yourself that you focus. My therapist told me something that really help: you‚Äôre not schizoaffective, you‚Äôre a person with schizoaffective disorder."

schizophrenia,f7a9neu,t3_dudvp5,1573523935.0,I actually stopped taking it soon after lactation started. At the time I had no idea that there was meds that could stop it. I actually only heard from my doctor (a different one) that there were meds that can stop it. But yeah it was so embarrassing. :/ hope you can find something that helps
AmItheAsshole,f76xczh,t3_dujnwr,1573438273.0,"YTA. CBD balm is not like Vaseline. It‚Äôs super expensive and has medicinal uses. Even if you didn‚Äôt know that, lying about the fact that you used it and then continuing to do it is jerky."

schizophrenia,f6yg60f,t3_dtr2vt,1573278674.0,"I know it‚Äôs really scary but please talk to someone you trust. Don‚Äôt think of it like being crazy, it‚Äôs like a medical issue. Go to a doctor so they can figure out what will help, just like you would if you had a broken leg. I was so scared to talk to someone when started seeing things but talking to a doctor really changed my life for the better. It can all get so much better if you can talk to someone. Stay strong and be safe."

schizophrenia,f6v1jpl,t3_dt599k,1573174152.0,"I guess my problem with never putting people on meds to begin with is how to cope with the symptoms when they first happen. Usually it happens gradually until one day something extreme happens and you end up in hospital. If you have such severe symptoms of psychosis that you literally can not function in society or tell what‚Äôs real, I can‚Äôt personally see how talk therapy would be enough to get you functioning again without taking who knows how long. The great thing about meds is they help you become rational enough to begin having that conversation about what‚Äôs happening to you and to realize that you have a mental illness. Without that first step of reconnecting you to the world outside of your psychosis, it just seems so hard to just cope via talk therapy, esp if you‚Äôre super paranoid and have trouble trusting people to begin with. 

Anyways just my opinion. Sorry for the super long post. :) think it‚Äôs a cool thing to discuss"
schizophrenia,f6uzet1,t3_dt599k,1573172535.0,I went off my meds off of the advice of some well meaning people. It was horrible. I thought I was fine at first but little things kept happening until one day I just totally freaked out. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea. I think that‚Äôs a dangerous idea to tell people. Schizoaffective btw
bipolar,f6p55uj,t3_dsdoyn,1573047720.0,Maybe a positive association? Eat a fun food or drink right when you take your meds. Or reward yourself right after by watching your fav tv show
schizophrenia,f6p4pl4,t3_dseohh,1573047341.0,"I was on seroquel for a while. It was really calming and made me very mellow, though admittedly probably too sleepy. I finally went off bc it wasn‚Äôt working anymore. I had an extreme reaction to abilify though. It made dizzy and light headed so I couldn‚Äôt even stand. Hope it helps. Good luck!"

schizoaffective,f6o7bxz,t3_drewxf,1573009461.0,I was super social and outgoing. Thought I‚Äôd be able to do anything. Now I have no friends and get anxious going outside. Have no hope or dreams anymore. Just wanna get through this.
schizophrenia,f6nb5k0,t3_ds4fn5,1572987895.0,Don‚Äôt give up there are emergency services for people who can‚Äôt afford it. There‚Äôs the national suicide line and you can even chat online if the phone makes you nervous
schizophrenia,f6n18nr,t3_ds2rzs,1572983042.0,Honestly that kind of stuff makes me pretty angry. I  went out off meds after an ex convinced me that my hallucinations were a gift and a look into the ‚Äúotherside.‚Äù I‚Äôve ended up going off of my meds and it was super bad. I think one of the worse things people can do is convince you that west you‚Äôre seeing or hearing is actually real. We go through all this therapy and stuff to realize it‚Äôs fake and it all goes out the window when people are saying it might be real after all...
schizophrenia,f6jli6x,t3_drjrb6,1572896527.0,"I would really talk to your parents before trying again. You might think you‚Äôre running their life but I guarantee they don‚Äôt. I know a parent whose kids killed themself when they were a little younger than you and they were never the same. It didn‚Äôt make their life easier, all they felt was guilt that they didn‚Äôt know what was going on in their sons life (in this case they were being sexually abused by someone). Please talk to them first before you do anything."
schizophrenia,f6jkwvv,t3_drjs1h,1572896270.0,"Hey that‚Äôs cool‚Äî is it for a project?

1. Stigma about it, being able to talk and get help without people thinking you‚Äôre dangerous or crazy. Figuring out what works with meds and coping strategies be right now I feel like it rules my life. 

2.  Growing up I was super confident and that‚Äôs all gone. I have no friends and feel like the only people I can talk to without being judged are therapists. Lifestyle would be being able to believe that I could do and have the same things I used to. 

3. I have trouble driving. I can‚Äôt focus and am scared I‚Äôll hallucinate and hurt someone. But I really wish I could drive and am still trying to learn"
schizophrenia,f6gw68d,t3_dr3zsv,1572831713.0,Hey sounds more like OCD if you aren‚Äôt experiencing the symptoms and are ‚Äúobsessed‚Äù with whether or not you have it. I would listen to your therapist. Good luck!
schizophrenia,f6ag7x4,t1_f6a0hip,1572756438.0,I‚Äôm schizoaffective and believe in the paranormal. I actually went off my meds because I had an ex tell me that my hallucinations were visions of the beyond. It was a big mistake tbh. :/ I think going to a doctor is really good even if you do believe in that kind of stuff. That way you can be more sure that you‚Äôre getting help if you need it.
