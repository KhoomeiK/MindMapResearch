And having dropped out of the work, things were good. But I've been in therapy for years now and done a lot of work on myself and my friends have not. It's hard to know that your friends aren't as mentally healthy as yourself or so it seems. But everyone has their own path they have to follow. You can't stop your own path to accommodate others"

AmItheAsshole,fqssx5a,t3_gkoqzt,1589617710.0,"INFO Is your husband identifying as brown and latinx while denying his blackness? He can be both. People are both all the time. 


All dominicans are mixed. Some are mixed with black. The DR shares the island with Haiti and is a result of enslaved people, indigenous peoples and Europeans mixing for generations. 


Your daughter still has to respect you both no matter what tho. And she may have a point about reclaiming and acknowledging her blackness. That excuse her disrespect of you or her father.

- from a Mexican adult starting to learn and acknowledge my indigenous heritage and engaged to a black American. He said your daughter needs to be respectful and he helped write this. And she's trying to say she's black without any black experience and it's coming off as disrespectful and racist to black people and disrespectful to you."
