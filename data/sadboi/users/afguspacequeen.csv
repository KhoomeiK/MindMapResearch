I highly recommend offering counseling or even suggesting taking a break for a while just to see if that triggers a response from him that genuinely recognizes the severity of your feelings. If he falls back into this pattern again, keep talking about it. Leave him lists of things to do while you’re at work if he is still unemployed, tell him to find a job he can hold down, tell him he is abusing the dog and that is unacceptable — these things are grounds to make a case that he makes no effort to help you and can justify leaving should you decide that is your best option. If he cares about you in the same way that you care so deeply for him, his response should be concern for you and how he is hurting you and how to fix it. If he refuses to take steps to better himself, then you are only going to continue hurting yourself should you stay in that situation.

It doesn’t bother me as much in my 20s,  but my dad tells me that I’m problematic and a trouble maker. I’ve learned that if I can have a conversation with the people that dislike me about WHY they dislike me, it’s usually because I come off as arrogant to them, when in reality they are not accustomed to a woman with strong opinions voicing her thoughts.
