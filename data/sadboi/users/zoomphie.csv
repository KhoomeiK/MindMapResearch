TransSupport,fqm934a,t3_gjl564,1589473572.0,"Hey there! I’m in an extremely similar place (26 10.5 months HRT), speech therapy, regular therapy, got more feminine clothes, starting to get better at makeup etc., and I still feel like nothing has changed. Looking in the mirror still hurts a lot of the time. I think all the time about how I should have let my egg crack and started HRT the second I could after highschool.

Here are the two things that have helped me so far: 

I left almost every serious trans subreddit except for
r/transsupport
r/asktransgender
r/transpositive 

It really helped. I realized I had been comparing myself viciously to others and it was really messing with my head. Particularly on r///transpassing where they’ll either worship you like a queen/king or pick you apart like vultures and give you a whole new set of things to be dysphoric about. 

My trans coworker (who ‘passes’ at 4 years HRT) basically said this: “some trans people have that sweet luck and it’s like a single drop of HRT makes them beautiful princesses/princes, but for most of it it’s not quite so easy. KEEP GOING! You have to grow into it. We’re going through puberty for the second time, and most cis girls/guys don’t look their best at 13/14. It just takes time, as much as that sucks, and it’s time to start evaluating your passing standards. Are you holding yourself to impossible beauty standards most cis women don’t meet? Are you hyperfixated on specific areas of yourself? If you were a 14 yo cis girl would you have similar insecurities? You just have to keep rolling with it. Look back at old pictures of yourself and look in your eyes. What do you see?”

So I did the last part and I saw what she was talking about. They were cold. They looked dead. I looked at one of the few selfies I’ve taken now, and they’ve changed completely. HRT may not have made me the most beautiful woman in the world yet, but it breathed life into me. 

That being said, I still really struggle to listen to the rest of that advice, but I’m trying to learn to be kinder with myself, and that’s been keeping me going. 

No idea if this will help at all, but I hope that it does, and I hope you find a way to be at peace with yourself very soon. Keep going!"

asktransgender,fmt89hh,t1_fmsgh6d,1586368449.0,"I agree, it will definitely help soften things up. I went from like decently muscular tuxedo build to softer arms/shoulders/neck. I’ve still got wideish shoulders but as long as I wear the right things it isn’t really a problem and I’m at 9mo. You’re gonna make it!"
TheMixedNuts,fhksspq,t3_f3pgqa,1581690587.0,"Hello! 
It’s good to see you again! (Or read from you?) Same mixed nut, different account. 

I’ve been in an awful place, but then this week made took that and spun it 180°. 

School has been really hard to cope with general mental health stuff this term but I hung on by a thread and stayed. I’m really glad i did. On Tuesday a gorgeous enby person from one of my classes texted me and was like “hey, so..flirting as an adult is hard? But I think you’re cute, wanna hang out some time?” And I was blown away, cause I had gotten in a “nobody is ever gonna wanna date me” rut. 

We hung out Wednesday and they’re pretty amazing, I feel like I’m in seventh grade and I have to post on my livejournal about it. They even said they’d like me to be their anti-capitalist valentine. 

I’m glad to see you’re still around, even through different glasses, and I hope you have a great day!"

asktransgender,f5p9ts3,t3_dojmx8,1572353627.0,"Hey there! I’m your friendly neighborhood trans girl who experienced a similar situation, with mine coming to an end in June. 

Of course everyone’s situation is different, and please disregard if this doesn’t help you at all. For three years I had the joy and honor of being with a Pansexual cis-woman. She knew from the get go that I was pretty sure I was trans, but at the time I had a million reasons why I couldn’t transition. I realize now those were excuses and walls I was put up because I was (rightfully) afraid.

A big reason though, was our relationship. She’s Pansexual, but where her attraction lies is more in masculine features. Men both cis/trans, masc-ish nonbinary (I went as they/them for a year before taking the plunge) were all attractive to her. You know, those masculine features I hate about myself and want to get rid of? 

Things finally came to a head in June, when I couldn’t delay anymore. I just couldn’t keep living as I was and, well, keep living. We talked and talked and cried and talked some more and it boiled down to three main options (with some wiggle):

A) have me what knuckle it and keep holding out as cis for the relationship (not a good option but out of fear I suggested it).

B) stay together while I transitioned and run the very real risk of her losing any and all attraction or interest in me, culminating in potential resentment and a messy breakup. 

Or 
C) amicably break up, stay best friends and essentially domestic partners (I moved to another room) and have her there by my side during transition. 

We chose C, and while of course part of me misses her romantically, I’m glad that’s what we went with. 

Of course my situation isn’t typical, as no one situation is, but I hope that the take away is this: you can delay and delay and delay, but it’s still gonna be there. You can white knuckle it and try to remain cis, but it’ll still be there. You have to transition for you. It’s your body, and your choice. You may have to let go of relationships along the way, and that will be painful, but the joy you can find in being true to yourself is so freeing. 

I believe in you, whatever happens. 
-Josie"

The first day I didn’t nitpick every last detail of myself, put on an outfit that I liked, and went to class. Thank you for your encouragement, you are so kind!"
