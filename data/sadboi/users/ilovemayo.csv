Columbus,fqgbgwz,t1_fqee4ni,1589342171.0,I‚Äôm a SC contract analyst currently at $85k but looking to move upward. (Not sure of that will be possible in my current group due to lack of foreseeable openings) I would be interested to hear how you moved up to where you are now.
Columbus,fqg8x3e,t3_ginor0,1589340526.0,Stefan Channels with HER. He is based in the areas you are looking and is a straight shooter (hard quality to find in the industry).
Anxiety,fqa41uk,t1_fq95gb8,1589212441.0,"Haha I came to say exactly ‚Äúall... the... time‚Äù! I find myself apologizing for my awkwardness when no one else felt I was being awkward. I waaaayyyy overthink most social interactions and it can be debilitating at times. I try to do what you do and remind myself that I am the only one that noticed. It‚Äôs all about cognitive therapy and letting yourself make mistakes. If you are genuinely nice to people otherwise, they won‚Äôt care if you say the wrong thing from time to time."
90DayFiance,fpkmgpe,t1_fpbrpwo,1588697283.0,I second this. I was an exchange student in the early 00s to a third world Latin American country and I lived with host families comparatively far better off than my own at home. I had to defend the misconception that we were all rich and drove luxury vehicles. I was only able to participate in the exchange program because it was a scholarship program. I had one host family that especially had difficulty understanding why I could not afford a lot of extras like tennis lessons at their country club (their suggestion because their kids took them).

Columbus,f9ypq5g,t1_f9yce9t,1575732086.0,I disagree. I hate what the continuous construction has made the Short North become. Bye to the unique character and hello to commercial where everything is owned by like 3-5 companies or is a chain. I have lived in Vic Village for many years and my husband and I have decided to leave the neighborhood and move. What made me love the Short North is quickly dying.

BeautyBoxes,f0yp338,t1_f0vtj3m,1569074620.0,Yeah the powder is more up my alley as I rarely wear lipstick. And I agree about the pouches. The plastic pouches were useless. They always tore apart and as a BB junkie I have more pouches than I know what to do with. I‚Äôd rather have another product to try.

Columbus,exc58et,t1_ex6qz55,1566143797.0,"There is a motto that they want you to leave work the same or better condition as when you arrived. Being in the field of a utility company can be dangerous work if safety protocols aren‚Äôt followed so that‚Äôs what that is about. As for culture, they are trying to shed the ‚Äúold boys club‚Äù culture stemming for the 1950s. They have been late to that change due to being mostly engineers (which have a tendency of being very conservative)"
Columbus,exc4n4w,t3_cqdzru,1566143517.0,"I‚Äôve been at AEP a couple years and I like it. It is still rather ‚Äúold school‚Äù in terms of culture but they have put an emphasis on improving that over the past several years (more diversity in mgmt, flexible hours, etc). People don‚Äôt leave because they pay well and the benefits are good. They still have a pension program which is almost unheard of. Overall, unless something horrible happens or I get an incredible offer I can‚Äôt pass up, I plan on staying there throughout my career."
