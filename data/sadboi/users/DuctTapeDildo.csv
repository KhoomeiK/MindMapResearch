NewToEMS,fmywlha,t3_fy6ai2,1586498021.0,"EMT's pretty much do ambulance work where they provide basic healthcare. Their scope of practice (the stuff they can do) is pretty small in the grand scheme of things, but still can be vital and essential. These include wound care for things like stabbings and cuts, splinting broken bones, giving oxygen to people that have difficulty breathing, CPR, etc. These are all basic life support (except for CPR but thats a different story). If you want to do more, but still work on an ambulance, you can become a paramedic (or maybe an advanced emt, depending on the area). Paramedics are first, basic emts like mentioned above, but they go to additional school. They start getting into things like giving people IV's, giving people different varieties of drugs, etc. The difference between the two is just paramedics get more into medicine and drugs on top of basic life support like wound care and splinting and oxygen. I'm sure some places might let you do ride alongs, but if not, they can at least show you their rigs and talk about their experience. Just call a place and ask to come over one day or to do a ride along. You may be able to go to a volunteer fire department and sign up, so I'd also look for that.

For doing it right, make sure you arent making silly mistakes. Some mistakes could be that the diaphragm of the stethoscope could be flipped the wrong way (for this, you should look at the stethoscope right below where the diaphragm is. There should be a flat side and a round side, make sure the big diaphragm is on the flat side). You could also not have the earpieces facing the right way so, make sure they're pointing towards your eyes when you put them in. You might also have not placed the cuff on properly (most bp cuffs have the big arrow pointing to where the brachial artery should be so, make sure that it's all aligned properly. If your cuff doesnt have have an arrow, just have the sphyg right above the brachial. Also make sure the cuff is about an inch or two above the elbow crease).

So like if someone got hit somewhere, imagine what that might do on the inside. Also, remember this order: scene safety, bsi, abc's. Everything else comes later, including extractions, vitals, ect. If you studied and was attentive during class, you'll know all the material, it's just about the scenarios they give you. So to sum up, scene safety, bsi, ABC, everything else.

When you're hours away from dying, how do you want to think about your life. Do you want it to be wasted energy, or do you want it to be a fulfilled time?"

I think its just that humans are social animals and that the night is when you're alone for the most part so all of your thoughts that were being drowned out earlier finally have a way to ""escape"" (idk the best word to use).

WinStupidPrizes,esacbw8,t1_esa7djo,1561756416.0,"I want to say, suicide and crime are different, subjects and I don't think they should be talked about in the same argument. But anyways, did some research about how gangs get guns because I never thought about it from that aspect before. It mentioned 41% of parolees found it harder to get a gun after Maryland's firearms and safety act of 2013. I'll try to look into that act later but whatever that law did, we should consider implementing in other places and maybe adjusting it if needed for different places. Again, I believe we should change some laws, but I still want law abiding citizens to be able to own guns. An article I read a while ago said crime in a Massachusetts town (I believe it was mass.) went down after they required citizens to get permission from the PD (as well as all the other regular stuff) stuff before buying a gun. And the good part about that is that most people were still able to buy a gun. Anyways, like I said, I believe we should change some laws, as long as law abiding citizens (most atleast) are still able to buy a gun. Also I called you braindead once, calm down a bit. And by petty crime I mean stuff like muggings"

WinStupidPrizes,esa6wgc,t1_esa5yal,1561752894.0,"Criminals in gangs don't exactly use legal guns. Sure, some of them may go to a gun store to buy a glock, but it would be way easier for them to buy one off the streets (plus, if they want some crazy shit like full auto, or a sawed off, they can't exactly buy it from a regular store). I know a kid who bought a gun off the streets from a major city near me in the us, so it wouldn't exactly be hard in even ghettoer places. And mafias are organized crime groups. They do more ""white collar"" sorts of crimes compared to gangs. Mafias aren't about drive by's and petty crime."
