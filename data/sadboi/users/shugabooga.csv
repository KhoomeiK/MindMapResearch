expats,fnudd5c,t3_g3wy1w,1587259610.0,"Take your time and think it through carefully.  Filipino women are very sweet but also very ambitious when it comes to marriage and children.  They want to marry a white man and leave their country.  They love white men and want to their children to be half white.  I was a nanny to a white man and Filipino woman and also another little boy from another family where the husband was a white American and the wife Filipino.  This was in Columbia, South Carolina and it was actually somewhat common for white men there to seek out Filipino wives online and bring them to the U.S.  It's not a secret that that is what these women want.  There are websites that cater to men seeking Filipino women who are seeking white men.  The three Filipino women that I knew were educated, Catholic and career-oriented - a nurse, a teacher who became an administrator, and a real estate agent.  They all wanted children and they wanted their kids to be Americans.  I think that these three couples are as happy as any other married couples.  But ultimately, for the women, it's about their children and raising them as Americans, or in your case, as a Brit.  

When I was a nanny in this home, I was bored at night and curious about how these relationships came about and googled it.  I can't recall the website but I remember that it was explained in a very nice way, like what I said above, but much nicer.  Like a very good public relations job.

The difference I see for you is that your girlfriend does not bring job skills and education  to the table in this transaction.   That's a game changer.  Based on my experience and limited knowledge as a nanny for a Filipino woman, I would say that your girlfriend wants to get the heck out of the Phillipines.  The men there are uneducated and don't have much of a future.   

I do know that they had a very hard time getting the Filipino lady into the U.S., even with her nursing career well underway, and even after they had gotten married - I think they got married in the Philipines.  It took eight months after the wedding to get her to the U.S.  And of course the U.S. and UK are different, but just to give you and idea of how this kind of immigration goes about."
