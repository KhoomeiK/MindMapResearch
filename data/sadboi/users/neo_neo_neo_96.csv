IANAL, Alright, lemme address this. This is a Big issue as per GST. You may get screwed by the tax department. 

>Now for the two bills, raised in July 2018, the payment is still pending. The client has taken the gst claim for the same and has shown those bills in his returns. Since there is no security with my cousin how will this work out? If a notice is sent to him, he will become ex parte. Then of the little what I know my cousin would need to file a case in his state. Is there any chance that my cousin will get his money back? How much time does this take?


The company can show the GST returns as services but if you file a complaint to the police for theft and I believe   to tax department as well.( I believe there is another  division you need to address in this case as well. I'm not sure which ). 



I don't think he can get his money back that easily through legal proceedings. However, if you can get a lawyer to make a filing and forward the same as a case to the company, it might incline them to pay him? (That being said, you need to get every thing straight in case they don't)."

But I'll make an suggestion. Tell them about the prenup. If they agree to it, then make all arrangements for the country change as well. [THIS DETAILS your particular case](https://vakilsearch.com/advice/can-nri-seek-divorce/)


Worst case scenario, just liquidate all your assets if something bad happens. This is the worst advice I can give you, but make a fail safe account only you know (Preferably offshore) and diversify your assets. Please note last resort.

[Divorce details](https://www.lawyered.in/legal-disrupt/articles/divorce-laws-india/)


And instead of you becoming a foreign national, which I believe puts you under the special marriage act, I'd suggest that you sign the prenup and marry in a country of your choice. How this works is since you're gonna get married in another country where prenups are valid, you can easily contest court proceedings. 




Also, if you're that  keen, I suggest you do an informal one in India, and then make a honeymoon plan on that country of  your choice and  then sign and marry there.
