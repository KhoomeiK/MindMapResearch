mountandblade,fqup3v3,t1_fqunqxm,1589662413.0,I think they factor in overall faction strength and expect you to contribute your forces to the army or participating in some way. When I was doing my Khuzait playthrough I would always attack  opposite end of our borders. It actually went way better than expected. AI would handle the giant army on army match ups and I'd take a castle or town on the opposite end where the enemies forces would be thin. So every war ended up with Khuzaits taking 4-5 fiefs before peace would be an option.
television,fqun8l8,t3_gk49sw,1589661595.0,Was the quality always this bad? I'm not talking about the aspect ratio but something is off with how it looks streaming on netflix. It bugs me and takes me out of it.

mountandblade,fqnnal7,t1_fqh3xkg,1589497941.0,"I kinda wish troops had unique modifiers that set them apart from each faction. It's weird to me the only difference with troops are stats and loadouts. Units should have certain perks that further set them apart. Ulfhednar should never flinch, attacks cannot be stopped. You either block or hope they miss. At least that way it seems like they ignore being injured.

Maybe it's too unrealistic but I think it would be very cool if troops had certain perks. Just more levels of complexity and depth would do this game wonders."
mountandblade,fqnl7q5,t3_gjurxu,1589496858.0,"Welp, I finally got in a good place with my campaign again and patch hits. What is the best way to keep playing without updating?

movies,fqnioac,t3_gjtt9o,1589495542.0,Pretty great for not having a script. It's a movie that relies on its characters to execute and they nail it imo. One of my favorites.

mountandblade,fqmrc8w,t3_gj2xqu,1589482236.0,"Isn't the issue is that all factions want to expand? Sturgia doesn't have the means to recover once they get their shit pushed in. So it's usually faction death due to waging too many wars. 

There just needs to be greater campaign map penalties for walking into Sturgia lands. Those unfamiliar to the terrain should suffer. Trying to invade Sturgia in the fall and winter should have some harsh penalties to further give them an advantage."

timberwolves,fpp9ljm,t3_geoykp,1588798324.0,He's an elite playmaker and Rosas desperately wants another playmaker on the floor with D'lo and KAT. That's why Deni is so intriguing and why the Wolves spent considerable time scouting him.

mountandblade,fphbsr9,t1_fph3a95,1588618475.0,I always end up training every skill. Blacksmithing is just really easy to get gold once you can craft Tier 6 2h Swords or even Javs! I can sell them for 51K a pop. Suddenly I no longer need 90% of the loot in the game. I just end up buying up all variety of food to pump a towns numbers to 50K total and I sell a sword lol.
mountandblade,fphbblw,t1_fph2y1k,1588618234.0,Yup a bummer to see my pos crafted weapons. I now produce Tier 6 stuff but the AI only seems to like pumping my garbage into the economy.
mountandblade,fph9yhg,t3_gdfasa,1588617552.0,"The more army management the better imo. I really would like a tactics page to control how your units might behave in a sim or on the battlefield. Not quite the command controls, something deeper like tendencies or behaviors I guess. Really customize how your army fights as a unit. Like prioritizing what you attack or defend.

Maybe I'm alone on this but more customization on that front might be nice."
mountandblade,fph8vyd,t1_fph3byp,1588617020.0, Okay but what about the concept itself? Because when you have a lot of troops the current system really sucks. Lots of scrolling. If I got another level to sort/organize that would be great. I like users conceptualizing ideas like this even if it's not the best it's a good idea to generate discussion.
mountandblade,fpezqeo,t3_gcz7yj,1588558478.0,Just more total war features in this game in general.

timberwolves,fp712bz,t3_gbdpmb,1588362117.0,"I really like Okongwu but knowing how Rosas wants the offense to run takes him completely out of the mix with our lottery pick. If you don't think he can develop a 3 point shot then there is no point. I think he is going to be a juggernaut on defense, a glue guy, role player. Basically the perfect fit next to KAT because I think Okongwu can switch out 3-5. Plus we need another big body to rebound . If you think he's Bam then I think he is worthy but a lot of what ifs.

I still think the best bet is to trade the pick for Turner or someone of his caliber if you want to be competitive next season. Going in the season with a top 6 pick on the roster wont push the needle much."
