I also wanted to meet entirely new people. Was very sick of my tight knit friend group from high school, and wanted to meet people who were not like them. That meant travelling in a way that was not like them (if I had just signed up for a Contiki tour or a wine tour in Italy, I would have been among people very similar to the friend group I was trying to grow away from).

I looked at a huge range of options - tree planting, night over night hikes, trekking in Nepal, etc etc.  What I ended up doing was a 12 week hiking tour of Oregon and Washington on the Pacific Crest Trail. Involved a huge amount of research and prep, including 2 weekends camping by myself close to home. I had to schedule myself to arrive to hike at the same time as the thru hikers. I really tried to stay open minded and get to know them. I arrived a week early and stayed in a hotel near ish to the trail, about an hour drive away, and practiced hiking with all my gear. That helped me leave at least 20 pounds of it behind and decide not to do cooking with heat (huge hassle I found). 

I'm very happy with the experience. I met people who were very different than me and I think came through it way less judgemental. I also connected with nature and understood how few material things I really needed to thrive, which has helped me in the years since (I now have solid savings). Also involved me conquering a lot of fears and understanding that I need other people to be happy."

I think this is a good plan.

In 2021, when it's safe to travel, you might consider going away for a week to see how you find it.

When planning your big trip, don't think about destinations: think about how you want to grow and change as a person. Ask yourself this: why am I really going? What do I want out of this? Why? What are my values? How do I want to change/live through/build them through this trip? Take the why's all the way down until you find the root reason. Then, build your trip around that. Plan for experiences, not for cities. Your itinerary shouldn't be based on a list of cities. If it is, you'll get bored easily and they'll start to blur together.

You can find their email here: [https://www.ourcommons.ca/Members/en](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Members/en) Politicians here are waiting to mandate a shutdown, because it's so bad for the economy and they imagine a lack of voter support for it. But waiting even just two or three extra days for a shutdown while cases double is even worse for the economy - plus, thousands die. Look at Italy."
solotravel,fkjcn2f,t1_fkii4as,1584242144.0,">I’m on month 2 of a 6 month travel plan. My family is also bugging me to return to Canada, but the virus has been way more contained in the countries I have been in than it is in Canada. I honestly think I’m at a lower risk in a country where they are taking it extremely serious right from the first case.

Go home to Canada within the next 7 days. You won't be able to come home otherwise.

The Canadian government just asked all Canadians abroad to come home. Get home before they close the border. You won't be able to get flights. You won't be allowed on the plane. If you think things in Canada are bad, wait until you see what healthcare looks like where you are when the cases increase.

Go home and follow the government's rule to self-isolated totally for 14 days."

The responsible thing to do is to go home. Many people with coronavirus spread it around before finally feeling symptoms and getting tested, breeding hundreds of new cases. Don't be one of those people."

Go home. No hug or greeting when you see them. Totally self-isolate for 14 days, following all the regulations - separate bathroom, no touching shared pets, no shared items/food, 2 metre rule, mask for contact, etc. If you go all 14 days with no fever, you're golden."

solotravel,fkjas9v,t3_fifduj,1584240715.0,"Don't count on your ability to fly or move freely.

It would be great for you to stay away from heavily affected areas, and quarantine yourself somewhere with a handle on the virus, like Singapore. If you have the money and can buy gold-plated health insurance that will cover you in Singapore, do that.

Or, make a break for it and go home - US healthcare is abominable and the country will face a major crisis, but if you'd prefer to be quarantined in a first world country, do that."

It's graph 9. From the article: ""Canada and Israel are both tracking along the 35% daily increase curve that most other countries have followed before social isolation measures were introduced."" Even with school closures, we're still increasing at a striking clip and will likely need significantly stronger measures to flatten the curve and save the health care system.

You can email or call your MP ([https://www.ourcommons.ca/Members/en](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Members/en)) to ask for a mandatory shutdown of non-essential businesses, which they're currently reluctant to implement due to a perceived lack of voter support for it. Such a shutdown would allow workers to take themselves out of harm's way and apply for EI."
