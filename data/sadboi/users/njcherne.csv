AlanonFamilyGroups,fquhwxf,t3_gkqlbr,1589659235.0,The dinner party is great to interact with others who have lost. My brother died five years ago. The biggest thing you can do is give yourself space to grieve and feel the loss. It hurts. Grief is the final act of love and it sucks. You can get through it with help. A grief therapist can help if you can afford it. I also got on anxiety meds years after when I couldn’t function. Talking about your sibling can help keep their memories alive. You will not forget them. One day you will get a random memory in your head and smile. This will be the point of knowing that you are going to be okay.
antiMLM,fqkjosq,t3_gjev9p,1589428820.0,"My response: 


There is so many things wrong with this. While I understand that businesses are suffering, people will die if we go back to “normal.” Personally, I dislike the mask. It annoys me. BUT as a fellow human, I do not want more people to die. That is what will happen if we re-open early. Essential oils can do lots, but that misses the point about covid. We do not know everything about this. It is new. It is too new to know all of its ramifications. Wearing a mask is a civic duty and we are lucky that we can do something. Reopening the state is a huge mistake. More people will die than have to because they are selfish and place their lives above others. That is what it is. A mask protects others from you. You can be asymptomatic and carry covid. You not wearing a mask can get countless people sick. You know what would bring the economy down? Dead people who cannot participate in the economy because they are dead. You know who else will suffer? The families and friends who lost their loved ones. Wearing a mask is a civil duty. Shame on you for using this platform to spread this kind of unscientific information."

I know I have been close to suicide, but I couldn’t do that to my parents. I will always fight for the idea of better, as exhausting as it may be. Depression will always be part of me, but it will not define me. My persona is also optimistic, so that plays a huge roll in my recovery. I also lost my brother and that was the worst thing to ever happen to me. It took me years to recover and when the worst thing happens, nothing (even depression) can ever feel that bad. It freed me. I look at my depression as something I can take on and something that will not last forever."

I am an optimist. Even when I am depressed and suicidal, I tend to be an optimist. It is contradictory. I had active suicidal thoughts for 12 years. My brother died. I didn’t believe it would get better. I didn’t know what to live for because my only sibling left me. I watched my grandma die and I wanted so badly to give up. I wanted to reunite with her and my brother. When I say it gets better, I am coming from rock bottom. It is not empty. I came closer to suicide than I care to admit, but I survived. I hope you can find something to live for and I wish you all the best."

Give your self space to feel your feelings, all of them. I let myself be angry with my brother for leaving me. Forget any logic, I was angry. I was pissed he died. From there I spent years asking why he died. What was the purpose? 

Finally, it hit me, there is no rhyme of reason he died. There is no lesson that would justify it. But it is a process that you have to go through and it will hurt. There will be a feeling of freedom after you go through it and you will be okay again."
GriefSupport,etsmbo8,t3_cd79bw,1563149423.0,"Something that took me a long time to do was letting go of “why” my brother died. I had a conversation with a higher power where I asked all the questions of why by brother died at 21. For every answer, I had a reason why my brother should have lived. All this to say, even if you knew why, it would not have mattered because your brother died. I don’t mean for this to be so harsh, I feel for you. If you knew, you would think of all the ways you could have stopped it. The what/if loop is so hard to get out of. What if your brother told you he was gay? What if you revealed that to your family? Who would that help? 

Your feelings are valid. You should ask why. It is healthy. Talk about it with your friends or I can listen! Your family could handle it in a way that would hurt you. I think you absolutely did the right thing by not telling your grandma about your brother. 

I am sending love your way.
