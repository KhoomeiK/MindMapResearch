SuicideWatch,f8x7lpc,t3_e2lxsf,1574910459.0,Wow it hit me because I also have the same mentality of making something either an album of music or a book and leave this world I wasn’t lucky either.  I can’t even enjoy music without a migraine destroying me. I’m going to the doctor to see what they can do if nothing changes I don’t think I’ll make it to 30. My teenager years were full of unhappiness i cannot go to 30. Im 20 now and i been suffering since 15.

SuicideWatch,f77atwl,t1_f75kvl1,1573449127.0,16 is not far from 18 or 19 even 20 that’s how this stage wasted 4 years of my life
SuicideWatch,f74nutb,t3_duaplp,1573405443.0,"I stopped believing in religion long time ago i remember praying in high school for a god to help me because i was going to graduate with the feeling of worthlessness i was the saddest kid graduating that day. I prayed before that they came to give me happiness. It never happened nobody is there. Religion is man made and thats why I’m Agnostic. Christianity was introduced by Christobal Colon when he “discovered” land coming from him. He was a christian who basically massacred everybody and that way introduced his religion of enslaving minds. What kind of loving god says You have free will you can be the nicest person ever but if you don’t believe or follow my regime i’ll send you to hell. 

On top of that the adam and eve thing doesn’t even make sense. How can a snake talk?"
SuicideWatch,f74mniv,t1_f74j7ln,1573404822.0,"I don’t feel like myself either it is the same stupid feeling of numbness and feeling like i don’t give a crap and it feels negative inside I haven’t felt positive in years on top of that i wake up several times a night i cant have peace in my sleep everything that i used to be is ruined and it breaks my heart. 24/7 with a headache and my family thinks I’m lazy they spread lies that I don’t want to work and always constantly reminding me I don’t have a job. I wish i was who i used to be to show them if im lazy or not out of 4 family members im the one suffering the most. 

I simply stopped believing in everything including religion I don’t believe in those who pray cause there were too many failed attempts I also tried praying and received nothing in return"
SuicideWatch,f74iely,t3_dud5q8,1573402937.0,I’m also scared it is scary when suicide is the only way out. If you asked 4-5 years ago i would say no but now im scared tomorrow is my birthday 4 years suffering at this point im 20 i dont even know why im celebrating my birthday anymore
SuicideWatch,f6j424x,t3_drk87i,1572888834.0,We’re in the same boat I dont think ill make it past 30 been suffering since 4 years it is really scary.

SuicideWatch,f5bbx0v,t1_f5b8jr1,1572119720.0,"The bible says god is a god if god could walk on water or raise the sea level why not help millions of people here suffering and throughout the world.

Cristopher Colombus preaching the bible and introduced Christianity to Native Americans and Tainos in the caribbean and later raped and murder all the tainos in the caribbean.

Religion sends you to hell for no reason at all why would i want to believe in that. Religion is man made which one do you believe islam christianity catholicism hinduism. How do you know you are following the right religion? Everyone thinks theirs is the right one.

I uses to be Christian now I’m Agnostic. Since I don’t have enough to proof whether god exists or not I joined this way of living if there is proof all follow the right one but until then I’m Free"
SuicideWatch,f5ar80x,t3_dngvcn,1572112292.0,I miss when i was happy and i felt normal like the people around me my life became a living hell it has been 5 years I want to be happy.

SuicideWatch,f5aouf7,t3_dnb9qt,1572111215.0,Don’t believe in what religion says you’ll become more depressed. I used to pray 2-3 years ago for a god to help me. Where is the help? People pray for others and nothing happens. Religion god is a fairy tale that each year gets a new version named “New Testament”

SuicideWatch,f4hcul1,t1_f4e5uon,1571590250.0,Its funny how people say I’ll pray for you or read the bible like that is going to change the situation. The only reason these people believe in nonsense is because 1. They are scared of hell so even if the bible is wrong they try to only pick the good stuff and 2. Because everything feels good when you feel good that is what they feel when they say “I feel god in my heart” where is god in this thread doing works millions of people suffering where is he in the thread no where to be found. I was really religious until I was alone suffering I prayed for an answer things got worse and now I don’t give a f about religion never went on sundays never will👌🏻
SuicideWatch,f4e1ciy,t3_dkfk4r,1571550614.0,Im going to start doing that is not worth it being awake in pain i have a fucking migraine and cant even listen to music because it gets worse i hate waking up every 2-4 hours to pee i hate this life where everybody is comparing me to someone else saying im lazy and saying i dont have a job i lost my innocence lost my faith in christianity during hardships i realized im alone and there was no entity like in the religions people praise im now Agnostic and ill never believe in a religiom ever again
SuicideWatch,exgl9t3,t1_exgkt6v,1566266991.0,I know how you feel man is like a nightmare where you can’t wake up and they numb you with pills
SuicideWatch,exgjvq4,t3_csr1a3,1566265972.0,"Be grateful for a Job I know it is hard to be grateful.

Everything that you think of yourself is a perception of the reality you live in. If you didn’t feel this way you wouldn’t be saying those things about yourself.

SuicideWatch,ex0syga,t3_cqywzx,1565921469.0,"Don’t depend on Religion if any entity actually cared about us we wouldn’t be in this state of mind. Religion makes depressed “knowing” there is an entity that receives prayers but never answers. 

Don’t commit suicide there might be hope hearing another person commit suicide just makes our state even worse we are like a family here. We share what we go through and are going through the same thing"
SuicideWatch,ewzj9o0,t3_cqfts1,1565896570.0,"Hopelessness broke him. When you go through life shattering every connection and living life like there is no hope and living like you are awake the whole 24 hours without rest for your soul is really heartbreaking.
