transgenderUK,fp8zuzk,t1_fp8z9f1,1588408941.0,"There is nothing wrong with language evolving or simplifying. It is meant to. We use it as a form of communication. I'm not miseducated on my native language, just open to the idea that maybe, if we presented ideas around issues within our community in an easier to understand light it may be easier to comprehend for a wider audience. I personally find it distasteful that we have put our language on such a pedestal that the idea of it evolving or changing or having to dare to use ""common"" words is seen as unintellectual or an affront to the language itself.

Those ""less common"" words are typically not found in every day speech for the vast majority of English people. I'm sure in academic circles it is expected that ideas be expressed constantly in such a manner but it is alien to hear them said in public. They are acceptable. I am not disputing their usage in this manner more pointing out that it can, when compared to speech, be a rather clunky way of expressing the concept and seem unnecessary.

dragonage,fp1soky,t1_fowl4fs,1588246634.0,"In all honesty, though it may require the Templar's to be scrapped and a new organisation (possibly offshooting from the Seeker's if Cass is still guiding them), should allow mages to live in their villages and set up a community focused system. Were Templar's are trained to care for and monitor mages in the community so if there is any illegal activity or nastiness it can be controlled, but the actual goal being to ensure mages can be a part of their communities and live productive, constructive lives with a actual family. Rather than being chained in circles. 

I think the circles still have a place in the world, as universities and schools to prevent mages losing control of their powers. But the current system creates such an us vs them mentality in both mages and templars. 

It's one of the reasons I like Dragon Age. There's such good discussion and debate that comes out of it. In all honesty I see the purpose of the templars, (if my neighbour could just explode and slaughter my street at the drop of a hat I'd be pretty fucking nervous) but despise the abuse of power they've displayed over the games."

We would not have had to exclude my parents of their behaviour hadn't proven them untrustworthy with big life events and it's not up to me to police my parents. They can behave civilly and be included in my life or not and miss out. That's their choice not mine."
UKweddings,fi8z8db,t3_f713xc,1582251804.0,"Hi there! So I've given it a cursory looksie, but as u/ScrollingJabroni said, airbnb lets you search for places with a hot tub, as does [cottages.com](https://cottages.com) which I havn't used personally, but has a 4 star rating from trustpilot. 

For curiosities sake may also be worth looking through this:  [link](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/HotelsList-England-Hotels-With-Hot-Tubs-zfp7766702.html)  if a hotel may be preferable. It's trip advisors top 10 hotels with hot tubs. 

Otherwise, if you have someone willing to host, there is always the possibility of hiring a hot tub and throwing a more personal affair. Though this would require a willing host for all six of you. 

Hope this helps :)"
ukpolitics,fi5gydk,t1_fi4zh9f,1582162900.0,"So im absoloutely not a doctor so my first advice always is see a doctor. 

But if it's solely to do with body image it usually comes under two I know of. Gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia. 

So if it's a gender thing the easiest way to tell is if you feel gender euphoria. A term I've heard in the trans community for the elation upon being recognised in your actual gender. 

Dysmorphia is a dark and exceptionally ugly beast that is associated with eating disorders. The general gist of it is as described above. Your body feels alien to you. This can be having an entirely skewed opinion of your weight (typically feeling a lot larger than you in reality are) or feeling shorter, uglier or generally just different than what appears in the mirror. It can be disconcerting to say the least and tends to come in waves. Some days being a lot better than others. 

Different people have different coping mechanisms. Some find certian clothes help (waist coats, hoodies, are all ones I've heard) or things to distract when it gets awful and ground you in the now (bracelets, charms) much like the advice is given with anxiety. It's about trying to reaffirm reality in healthy ways. 

I'm sure there are others out there but I don't have experience with them so I can't give much more insight. But absoloutely see a doctor of you've been feeling this way and I'm sorry :( it's an awful thing to experience."
UKweddings,fi3uwpz,t3_f66vj4,1582128164.0,"Congratulations! As for whether people will see your ceremony as ""fake"" it's not down to them. People renew vows all the time and having another ceremony in the U.K will be a nice way to marry your two cultures. 

As others have said it's a good idea to get an idea of venues. Might be worth considering how much you can save and what kind of budget you'll be looking it at when your return for your wedding. 

May also be worth looking at the kind of theme and venue you would like so you have an idea of what youll need to have that theme come to life. 

As well as looking at what you want. Having a rough outlined plan will save you a lot of effort in the long run."
ukpolitics,fi11y6a,t1_fi0qj0e,1582049025.0,That's a good one. I have to admit I hadn't thought about age in that way either which is definitely something to think on.
ukpolitics,fi09mk5,t1_fhzk2g9,1582031146.0,"The thing is I have attempted to make myself feel good. People seem to forget transitioning is the best medical process we have come up with to aid transgender people and that gender dysphoria is not a mental disorder in the traditional sense. It's only in the dsm to aid diagnosis as it causes significant distress not because being transgender is a mental condition. 

Alongside this their is some phsyical evidence to suggest are brain scans are closer to the gender we are. 

But going back to my original point I didn't just wake up one day and try and transition. I spent years trying to go through therapy to feel comfortable with my body. I've been through a lot of medication in that time and it has had precisely zero effect on my dysphoria. 

As for taking a pill and being comfortable with me that's a very dangerous what if. It'd certianly make a lot of other people's lives easier if I just took a pill and wasn't me but the same could be said for being gay. There are even trans people out there in bigoted situations as there are gay people out there who may take you up on that offer if it existed. But it would fundamentally change who I am. So yes I believe it would change me to not me. 

Presenting and being male has changed my life for the better in so many ways because for the first time in my life I'm being seen as I am and not the mirror person. I've been a lot more confident and happy. The distress I felt previously is all but gone (but I still have a surgery to go so there's still some issues to be resovled). 

Our current society frames transitioning as a choice. Like cosmetic surgery. Or as a mental illness. I truly believe it's neither. We don't choose how are are made or the intricate things that can go wrong in the many sexual karyotypes humans can end up with. Intersex people are treated as having a medical issue that needs surgery to correct the issues that may arise from their condition but when it comes to being transgender it's suddenly treated as if we are mentally ill. I suppose it's easier to think that with less easily seen physical abnormalities. 

In the end I think the best way to phrase it I can think now, and granted I'm a bit tired so this ramble may not be the greatest. But we advocate the best medical treatment we have for the situation. To use your example the dog person may be suffering and need therapy and that is the best we have to treat them. But years of medical practise has given us transition as the best medical option for transgender people. And from personal experience I would still be in a lot of anguish I wasn't able to present as the man I am. 

Thank you for taking your time to empathise. I appreciate the effort. It's a hard thing to digest when your not in the situation. I hope I can help you understand even a little :)"
UKweddings,fhziqb2,t1_fhxuhml,1582000634.0,"Thank you! I like the idea of a what's left to do thread. Wedding planning can get complicated quick and it might help to have a running list of common things that might otherwise slip your mind. Also be nice to see how people are doing planning wise. 

I'll try and put together some ideas for a faq and see if anyone else puts foreward some. Thank you for the suggestions they're great ^^"
ukpolitics,fhzihee,t1_fhyuktn,1582000438.0,It's all good. At the end of the day most trans people are people. We just want to exist. I'm just glad that a rant can maybe help people understand who otherwise wouldn't. There's nothing wrong with not understanding entirely. Because if you did you'd probably be in my shoes. We shouldn't punish people for not walking into the world not knowing everything  though it would be nice if we didn't have to educate everyone on LGBT issues we are not there yet and I can be mad at the situation but not people.
ukpolitics,fhzi8qr,t1_fhym5sx,1582000249.0,That is an amazing description.
ukpolitics,fhxtb0v,t1_fhxopka,1581961830.0,"The problem with this argument is it forgets trans men. By fighting to have spaces segregated by sex, your asking me a trans dude post surgery to hang out in the same space with a Wang."
