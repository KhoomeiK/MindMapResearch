AskReddit,fqsk63s,t3_gkfaeh,1589609580.0,"I'm 17 now I cant go to the doctor without someone coming in with me or having to get called. I can't start testosterone because I can't drive and my guardian refuses to take me because she is 64 and doesn't wanna getting covid. Though she makes the decision to leave me home alone for a weekend while she goes to a major city (that has a lot of confirmed cases for covid) for the weekend. I'm trying to file for a legal name change but once again with that she needs to sign all the paperwork and she gives me a hard time about it. She became my legal guardian from her choice and suggestion and i find it unfair that she gets to hold so much shit above my head because she's my guardian. 

Tldr: I hate being 17."

AskMeAnythingIAnswer,fcpn2ql,t1_fcpmasp,1577867865.0,Transgender is sometimes hard to explain because some people will understand it and some people won't. But in the simple way to put it the brain in the body doesn't match the physical parts that the brain would like to have. So your brain basically becomes a bitch until you can start transitioning and all I have so far is the name I like and some chest binders to help my chest look flat so I look more masculine.
