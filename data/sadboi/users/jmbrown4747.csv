Hypothyroidism,faka1ei,t3_e9c09e,1576163571.0,I honestly wish this disease onto every doctor who told me (and everyone else) that if their TSH was “within range” they should be fine.
OCD,f9i5142,t3_e54q7u,1575328430.0,"I have this exact voice in my head. I hate it. I know it lies, but it never stops, and it’s so loud, sometimes it’s all I can hear. I’d give anything for just 2 minutes of peace."
OCD,f9f3r1o,t3_e4obhn,1575258774.0,"I definitely do this with clothes, but because I think if I don’t wear the green shirt enough, the green shirt will be sad and will think I don’t like it. So I HAVE to wear it the same amount as the red shirt so they’re even, and no one is jealous or feels bad. I did this with my stuffed animals as a kid too. Magical thinking, I suppose. I think this may be the reason I tend to keep a small wardrobe with not too many choices."
Anxiety,f9aq86v,t3_e45wza,1575205239.0,"Yes, but my father is emotionally and verbally abusive to me. As a now 43 yrs old, I am almost non functional with anxiety and depression because one of the people who’s supposed to love me most thinks I need to change every single thing about myself, from my personality, to my physical body, to how I choose to express myself, to my job and the kind of car I drive. I’m sure your mom is a better human, but make sure and talk to her about how it makes you feel. She’ll probably want to do anything she can to make your life a little less stressful. She may not even realize she’s doing it."

Hypothyroidism,f8p73bf,t3_e1gnum,1574696751.0,"Yes. Get another dr. Immediately. If you’re not feeling well, and your dr won’t help you, you need a new dr. My first endo refused to treat me for hypothyroidism, which I do have. But insisted I needed treatment for diabetes, which I don’t have. I asked about the thyroid tests other than TSH and she told me they wouldn’t give me any info. She said if I insisted she’d schedule an ultrasound, but it would be a waste of time, because I would t get any info from it. I filed a formal complaint with the hospital she’s affiliated with and found another dr. They tested all the thyroid things, and did an ultrasound and found out my thyroid is enlarged, I have 2 large nodules on one lobe that’ll need a biopsy, and I also likely have Hyperparathyroidism. Luckily, thyroid cancer is super rare, and not something I need to be concerned about, but benign tumors are still tumors that will need to be removed. Look at all that info from those things my first endo said weren’t useful. I’d say you and I both could’ve been treated sooner and already would be feeling well instead of feeling like crap for the holidays."
Hypothyroidism,f8l0nkc,t3_e0zulx,1574617177.0,"You’re doing great! You can shop in any store you want. No one looks at you sideways about what you do or do not eat, regardless of your perception. A little piece of me dies everything time straight sized woman feels like she’s too fat. I wear an 18 or 20, so does that mean that me so too fat? I have no presence of diabetes, my blood pressure is 100/64, I don’t have high cholesterol, I have perfect kidney and liver function. I eat vegan, with carbs. Being fat is not the worst thing you can be. I’m pretty dang cute, actually. So are you."
