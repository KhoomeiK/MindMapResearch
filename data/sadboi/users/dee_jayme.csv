depression,fcrqjmw,t3_clue8y,1577905278.0,"I have know for a few years I would. And every time I get closer and closer. If I actually had a gun I would have finished it. I keep watching everything slip through my fingers. I am almost 40 with no kids, even though I raise 2 non biological children for 15 years and now that they are adults don’t want anything to do with me, and told me I will never see their children. I lost the love of my life.....twice in 4 years( how big of a fuck up am I?)I have dedicated my life to helping and assisting others. I have given my last dollar, shirt off my back, literally gave my lady’s to help others and given free housing.Put out good energy and positive thoughts and feet towards everyone. Everyone knows me but I have no friends, I have settled on a woman I have nothing in common with because I didn’t want to be alone. I hate every day, i drudge through life, not even noticing.... anything. I just don’t care. I stare into the void and wonder will today be the day. I can a note on me just in case I get brave enough. Well time to drive home... maybe today will be the day I finally drive off that bridge by 270"
