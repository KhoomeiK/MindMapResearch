BPD,fo9x31n,t3_g6ft9k,1587633767.0,I think most of us lie and manipulate when we feel its needed I actually ended up in the hospital with 8 cracked ribs and chose to lie so I didnt have to stay in the psych ward
BPD,fo9wpjv,t3_g65brl,1587633493.0,I mean it doesn't cute anything at all but our brains are hard wired to release certain chemicals when activities are done or goals accomplished so while its not a cure per say parts do contribute to a healthy lifestyle
BPD,fo9wfvr,t3_g61u5j,1587633319.0,I mean personally for myself I say not at all my fp and I have extremely rigged boundaries built up over the last 6 plus years so this has turned from a manic attraction to a genuinely understanding and well communicated relationship.
BPD,eyaludi,t3_cwdjzv,1566965309.0,You just gotta focus on the growth you talked about its gonna be a terrible tredge but you can do it! Just make sure you keep in contact with the other support systems you have!
