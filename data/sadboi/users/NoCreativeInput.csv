""I’m wondering about how you organize your experience in these medicalized terms and if you’ve considered alternative epistemologies for the way in which you experience yourself, your girlfriend, and anyone’s self states?""

when you say this are you posing the question: how could I essentially use different terminology to ""label"" myself? Or what I think you are saying is, how can we all (but me specifically since I made teh video) stray away from the labels that we are given and just see ourselfs as humans?

All I can really say is one of my mottos is: I am not a victim of my circumstances

Seriously tho. How did you know that??"
MrRobot,fbyyvci,t1_fbyx5ib,1577230111.0,"Essentially, yes. 

All the knowledge to hack is held by the ”real Elliot” which allowed hoodie Elliot (the alter we know) to do this thang. And yes, Darlene is a superhero too. 

Everything that happened IS real and did happen, it was just carried out by another facet of ”the real” Elliots (aka the body) psyche which manifeted as hoodie Elliot who is an alter who we all love and know."
MrRobot,fbywjic,t1_fbytvsb,1577228265.0,"Yes. Alters are ”real people” so to speak. They are just created in response to immense trauma. 

So if someone has a little, (which is a child alter) that is say maybe, 7 and named Aiden this person, let's say her name is Jessica, even though the body (Jessica) may physically be 27 when aiden fronts Jessica will ”act” like Aiden would, which is a child  

Everything an alter/fragment/part whatever you want to call it when they front- they think, act, talk, move like that person which can be totally different than the body and who that person is at their core- in the case of this show- it's Elliot (the one Darlene sees at the end)

So even though the body may be 27 and named Jessica and maybe is a bartender and has purple hair, when aiden fronts maybe aiden is 7 and loves dinosaurs and coloring and his favorite movie is the little mermaid- Jessica is then essentially ”gone” for the time being. 

Does that clear things up?"
MrRobot,fbyqc5f,t1_fbypgau,1577223535.0,"Goctha. 

Well just like side note for PC terms and to forward correct info in the world to end the stigma of mental illness but especially this condition; it's not called Multiple Personality Disorder, it's in the DSM-5 now as Dissociative Identity Disorder aka DID  

And I agree I think what you're saying in the last paragraph that it could be interpreted as if the system as a whole has a choice in who fronts. As in the whole thing is to essentially get hoodie Elliot to leave- it doesn't work like that- you can just push people (alters) away unless you are like, super aware of your condition and able to navigate who fronts and even then, that's hard sometimes."
MrRobot,fbypr24,t1_fbylekc,1577223104.0,Hmmm. Interesting. Alright right on
MrRobot,fbypd4o,t1_fbyjp66,1577222816.0,"Kind of. 

Elliot (the real one we never see) is what is sometimes called ”the body” (legit the physical body)So like who he was actually born as- born on September 19 or whatever and the body may be 22 irl but different fragments can be different ages when they are in control. 

So.
I call hoodie Elliot the host because the host is generally the person ”in the drivers seat” so to speak and because he is out (fronting) the whole time."

That line “Maybe HER validation isn’t what you need to feel like a man” that’s beautiful and then you went on to say “it’s not someone does TO you”

That makes a lot of sense and it makes me feel better. 

And really strikes a cord too of the things you do for her that make you feel like a man. I’m the same way, holding the door for her, comforting her, being protective and affirming her beauty all feels natural to me. I don’t have to try at that stuff.

MrRobot,f82v9ll,t1_f82u2s7,1574198890.0,"Woaaaah. Exposure therapy is something that should be done with a *professional clinician* in a controlled, safe environment. 

It is NOT something that people should involuntarily be forced into when they are sitting at home on their couches. 

I understand your view of “if you avoid things you retain your trauma” to but that’s not always the case and TV isn’t the place for healing to necessarily be done. 

Who is to say someone isn’t in a program of going to therapy 3 times a week to work through their trauma and yet, watching this episode or anything else of this nature is still triggered and potentially in crisis again?

Tldr; Tv is not an appropriate way of exposure therapy and it is involuntary to the sufferers of traumatic events."
MrRobot,f82t1pc,t1_f82sbhl,1574197656.0,"I knew someone was going to come at me with that weak argument “well then shouldn’t everything have trigger warnings?”

I understand that people can be triggered by many things due to their unique life experiences and maybe even suffer from PTSD - like you said, car crashes might be activating for some. 

But something as pervasive, triggering and detrimental as sexual abuse and the mere scope-of people it touches—*That* deserves a warning without question. 

That is CERTAINLY not to say anyone else’s trauma is invalid or less than. But due to the wide scope of this, it needs to be recognized."

It bothers me that people self diagnose, because yes- when I say I have 8 (that’s the number for sure that I always can solidly say but there’s always a few extra that I forget about) people might think they have the same disorders as I do, when in reality they do not so in the big picture it’s invalidating. It doesn’t make their pain not real or palpable to them, but there’s a difference between therapists over the course of the past 8 years telling me I have certain conditions."
