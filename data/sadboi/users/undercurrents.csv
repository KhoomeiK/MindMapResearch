They no longer had wipes at the entrance but when I went looking for them, I was just told I don't need them because they wipe down the carts constantly. But I didn't see anyone wiping them down nor was there a way for me to know if a cart had just been returned when I grabbed it. 

I haven't gone back to Pick N Save on Ogden because I went maybe 5 weeks ago and few people had masks on. But the woman working the the self check out not only wasn't wearing a mask but she was a close talker. Randomly came up to me while I was standing in line to ask me what I thought about her spray tan lotion. Then again while I was checking out came up to me to ask if I knew a good place online to purchase bras.

DailyShow,fpxz35o,t3_gg62qa,1588992535.0,"1. I've been watching the Daily Show for over 20 years. These shows can be informative (esp. Last Week Tonight) and they put into words what I am unable to. Plus, humor seems to drive points more effectively than straight news. For example, see interviews with Trump supporters on regular news and ones with Jordan Klepper. Humor can also help break down more complicated stories to the key points. Jon Stewart's eloquence often had more of an effect in stirring emotion from me than reading straight news reports. Previous correspondents also did investigative interviews, that while humorous, still exposed wrongdoings. Also remember, Stewart's team basically created the concept of playing old clips of a person saying one thing against their current words. I enjoy Trevor Noah as a comedian and watched him even prior to being tapped for the Daily Show, but the show (including some of the current correspondents) is not nearly as hard hitting as it was during the Stewart years. I never missed an episode of the Daily Show during Stewart years (as long as I was in the country), but I catch it now maybe 2-3 times a week. 


2. I watch every episode of Last Week Tonight. I used to also watch every episode of the Colbert Report. I watched the Nightly Show and the Jim Jefferies show when they were on as well. I also watch Full Frontal and the monologue of the Late Show with Stephen Colbert and A Closer Look on Late Night with Seth Meyers (I'll check out the interviews if they are with someone I find interesting). Another show along these lines I used to watch is The Democracy Handbook with Bassem Youssef. And I'll check out Real Time when I have the time. 


3. I'm a college educated female in my late 30s. Years ago Bill O'Reilly accused Stewart's fans of being a bunch of ""stoned slackers."" Stewart laughed it off but a study ended up being conducted (I'll try to find it) that showed the majority of Daily Show viewers are well educated and well informed while O'Reilly viewers were the complete opposite. Though obvious, it still ended up being pretty funny to see the numbers.

There are certain subreddits that are a constant shit show or attract red pill and incel behavior and even encourage it. So of course it exists.

>I chose to disprove this photo by going at the math, which is not useless. Please see the posts in reply to yours, the relative sizes of the moon and a rainbow are fixed. Period. This is due to physics.

>I also noticed the clouds not appearing in front of the moon, but chose not to go that route in my argument because there was already plenty of discussion about it in the thread, and people claiming that ""well maybe the clouds were really wispy and because the moon is so bright it was able to max out the exposure of the disk of the moon through the clouds anyway which is why you think the moon is in front of the clouds."" This is technically possible because if something is bright enough you lose all contrast when you get clipping in all the color channels. Think of it this way, and let's consider a monochrome 14-bit sensor for the sake of argument. if you have a sensor pixel collecting photons, where a value of 0 is black, and a value of 16384 is pure white (this is 2^14), once that pixel picks up 16384, it can't go any higher. If the moon is blasting enough light at you to cut through the clouds and hit 16384 on those cloud+moon pixels, then the moon *not* behind clouds will certainly be brighter and will hit that 16384 earlier in the exposure, but by the end they are both maxed out at 16384. This is what we call white clipping, and there's no contrast between bright stuff (the opposite being shadow clipping, where a part of the scene is so dark that everything reads 0 and there's no contrast between dark stuff). 

>I'm not saying that's what's going on here, because I think it's fake anyway, but that is one criticism of the photo that has room for argument. Surely that is part of the fu**ery going on here, but the math is irrefutable."

I'm used to bring alone and now I don't have the added pressures of forced to be social or forcing myself to get through work days. So I'm not sure I can give you the best advice but I just keep myself occupied during the day with reading, TV/movies, naps, internet browsing, and random chores I find I need to do. I go out for walks when I can (still cold here). I also picked up a new interest in a form of art Is like to try so I've been watching videos on that and  trying it out. I probably should be doing some form yoga or workout and cleaning but I have my limits with depression of how motivated I can be.

That's my only real advice for you- keep your days busy. It doesn't matter that you don't know anyone down there because with lockdown you couldn't see them anyway. I have no idea what to tell you about the dogs. That would drive me insane. Maybe watch videos on hard to train dogs? I really don't know. That seems like an added stress I wouldn't be able to deal with."

depressed,fpong6l,t3_geomn2,1588787441.0,"A couple of things. 

1. They will not start to work right away. It's going to take time to feel effects.

2. There is no way to know what anti-depressant works for you, at what dosage, with the least side effects, and possibly in combination with what other medication. So It's trial and error. It usually takes a couple of tries to figure out what's right for you. Tell your doctor about any side effects you are feeling.

3. Anti-depressants are not happy pills. They won't make you better on their own. You need to be in therapy simultaneously. What the medications do is help you get to a spot where you can actually function and think. That way therapy is more effective in working on tackling what is necessary to help you change- whether it's stopping negative thinking patterns, new coping mechanisms, changing things in your life, etc."

Sugar coating other people's nightmares of a reality because it bothers *you.* At the age of their daughter, I had already fully learned why my grandfather was a broken shell of a man. Why I had no extended family on my maternal side. What Auschwitz, Dachau, and gas chambers were. Those photos, those testimonies, those stories are supposed to stay with you. It's why we say, ""never forget.""

lastimages,fplt6fk,t1_fpljjss,1588718991.0,"I thought you would appreciate this. It's a passage from Infinite Jest:

>""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling."""

It was found to have some properties that affect serotonin that can help calm people down plus make you drowsy (doesn't make me drowsy but neither does melatonin or benadryl).
