 It's become worse during quarantine but that's because I cant distract myself at all. The fuck am I gonna do without the internet? Stare at the wall? 

Anyway, I've already decided I'm not gonna tell my possible future therapists anything since talking about it would make me uncomfortable and besides, no way I'll stop. And pretty sure once they find out I have BPD they'll turn me down/or give me therapy I've done 1000 times before and I'll have to wait another 6 months for a recommendation. My mom can't afford a paid therapist."

Also, same, I feel like everyday I'm a danger to society and that I should be locked up to prevent hurting people.
I've never hurt anyone before so I don't know why I'm so worried about myself.
The thing that helps me is to try and base my feelings in fiction and drawing helps me release these feelings and writing etc.

I have very fucked up fantasies such as other people here but possibly what is different is that I not only have sadistic urges but p*dophillic urges too (im censoring it just in case its a trigger for someone). I can't afford a therapist so best I can do is manage myself.

Quarantine has been killing me, I can't distract myself from my thoughts and I've been indulging in them rather than trying to stay away from them. I wish I could go see my friends, hopefully soon :/"

I have pretty intense/bad sexual desires that I know i shouldn't act on, which I don't because my rational mind stops me. I cannot stop thinking about it altogether so I let out my urges fictionally. Whether that be drawing, writing, role-playing, etc. That's how I deal with it.
