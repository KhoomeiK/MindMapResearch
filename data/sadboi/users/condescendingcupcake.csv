Shoes - <$100ish because anything above that, I would rather just get an auth dupe (ie. Steve Madden). I'm also terrible with shoes and I wear them down/get them dirty really quick so I wouldn't spend more than $300 auth or rep 

For bags, my threshold would probably be around $500, although right now it's around $200. If I know something is basically 1:1, I'd pay more for it just for ease of mind."

Microblading will fade faster than ombre brows if you have oily skin (the individual strokes will also kind of blur together). Permablend pigments seem to also yield the best results with respect to fading since it’s iron-based (quoted from the a PMU artist I consulted with).

You’re paying to not wait upwards of 2 weeks to a month or two and not having to go through an seller interaction (barriers such as language, timezone difference, response times might be annoying) basically. Shipping also costs quite a bit depending on the size of bags. Auth sellers accept that their use depreciates bags (they can afford and are willing to take the loss) while rep sellers might just try to break even (and rep users are likely in the mindset of saving money, to be purchasing reps in the first place).

3. LV Canvas bags - I'm too paranoid about color undertones and print alignment since I feel like those are the most in-your-face details. I also can afford auth LV canvas and would rather pay a bit more for auth + comfort of not being called out. On the other hand, I have no problem buying rep Chanel over auth since they are so well repped.
4. Mid-tier brands - Coach, Kate Spade, Tory Burch, etc. Despite being somewhat broke, I only carry luxury brand bags/wallets (LOL). Even though these will always be a good deal auth or rep, I'd rather that money go towards a higher end rep/auth branded bag.
5. Clothes - I already hate shopping online due to sizing and quality issues, so I'm sure this is prevalent in shopping on TB, DHGate, Aliexpress especially with asian sizing as someone who is not a size 0 or 2."

For quality I like to go by well reviewed products that are mid or high tier. I haven't purchased anything that hasn't been previously reviewed yet, although I might in the future. But I find that when I compare different tiers, I can see which cons I can live with. I personally want 90% of the bag to look real - so stuff like the date code, interior alignment and stitch count (unless really low) are not important to me, but leather/canvas quality, color and alignment are!"
xxfitness,fd5hpzm,t3_ek3arw,1578177783.0,"What are some booty exercises I can incorporate resistance bands to? I just bought one, and definitely plan on using them with my barbell hip thrusts and squats. I’ve been doing weighted exercises only with all of my booty/leg work outs, so is there any benefit to strictly using the band for exercises like fire hydrants?"
RepLadies,fcy38rl,t3_eje282,1578074153.0,"Does anyone have a good idea of which seller has the most accurate classic beige Burberry scarf? The most important thing for me is the shade of beige and accurate dimensions. Looking through reviews, seems like TS Oli & the DHgate one are popular."
RepLadies,fctqlji,t3_eilafo,1577954424.0,Do you think the indented CC is a call out? I just got this bag from Aaron and it was one of my biggest concerns!
RepLadies,fc6fqbz,t1_fc6c43d,1577479505.0,I believe this is the Tiffany Atlas ring!
RepLadies,fc6fgun,t3_eg9z55,1577479324.0,"I went with my mom to LV to purchase a Rivoli MM today and I have to say, I’d love to buy everything auth and in store if I could 😭😭 I’m a bit more satisfied buying things in store than getting a beaten up package in the mail 😛"
RepLadies,fc3roge,t3_efuabo,1577396918.0,How do you guys balance use with multiple wallets? I just purchased a rep Chanel zipped coin purse/cardholder and I have an auth LV emilie I’ve been using daily for the past 2 years. I want to not neglect the LV but at the same time bought the zipped cardholder so that I could have something small and portable for school. Do you guys just move your cards around based on whichever wallet you’re feeling?
millionairemakers,fbiev34,t3_edhj2m,1576898988.0,Yay
RepLadies,fbh4c1e,t3_ed2hci,1576865012.0,"I have an auth too! And I’ve been comparing my bag to TS Bank’s and honestly at first I didn’t think it was that bad but now everytime I see it, two things are call outs to me:

1) the overall shape of the bag - it’s more round than square and the size is too big

2) the GG - the thickness, placement and size of the logo are off 

Some minor things would just be the dull leather, texture of GG and hardware color. Overall I would prefer auth if I had the choice, since the bag is so common."
RepLadies,fbfm6tk,t1_fbflj5b,1576814066.0,I’m new as well! I saw a lot of OC reviews and just kept staring at the warmth of the canvas lol. I’d almost rather buy auth for that reason but I can’t justify the price right now 🤷🏻‍♀️ TS apple seems to be popular with her PSM (canvas looks decent)
RepLadies,fbfldkj,t1_fbfjaxi,1576813443.0,Wow I just posted a comment asking about this right before seeing this. Have you found a canvas closer in color to auth?
RepLadies,fbflax3,t3_ed21j8,1576813388.0,"For me, LV rep canvas color is my biggest concern. Do you think the extra warmth from OC’s is a call out? LV is pretty common where I live so a lot of times I might be in close proximity to auths"
RepLadies,fb9bczj,t1_fb7tx2e,1576634196.0,Yeah I met a girl who was 21 and had a Birkin. I later found out from her friend that her family is insanely rich and she wears hand me downs from her mom. Imagine having a Birkin as a hand me down LOL.
RepLadies,fb60taq,t3_ebe106,1576538572.0,"So I ordered a Chanel zip wallet from TS bank and a chanel WOC from TS aaron, both of which shipped a few hours apart on Dec 11. I’ve been checking EMS compulsively since then and the latest entry only said it had left Guangzhou. Got a message from my mom that the Chanel zip wallet had arrived while I was at work!!! Unfortunately I wont be able to see it in person until next week 😭"
RepLadies,fb1tm1b,t1_fb1mxc8,1576440996.0,The video does show that the alignment better matches the factory pics. The color also looks ok to me - the factory photos definitely have some darker lighting going on!
RepLadies,fb1ca9h,t3_eavsmm,1576434837.0,"I agree that the logo looks wonky. Compared to PSPs, the entire logo looks slightly tilted and off-center."
uwaterloo,faoapv3,t1_fao2yj1,1576260507.0,"I think this is the best advice here. Lol @ everyone else who thinks spending $0 a month on yourself is normal - it’s not. Yeah some people can go a whole term or year without spending money on themselves but realistically you’re gonna incur random costs like clothes wearing out or things breaking, running out of skincare etc (all of which you can’t really predict)."
RepLadies,faip5xv,t1_fai2kx3,1576113295.0,"I have an auth and I recently saw a review that made me immediately check mine to see if there what the difference was. Since I use this bag everyday, I knew there was something off but after putting pictures side by side, I found the logo is off (how close the GGs are, the length of the curve on the G, the roundness, the thickness of the Gs) and it also looks puffier than the auth due to the edges of the bag being rounded. I wouldn’t say its a terrible rep but if you know the bag you’ll know something’s off."
