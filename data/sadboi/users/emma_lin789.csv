introverts,foosovr,t3_g8ohey,1587945639.0,"Introversion is about energy levels, I believe? If you‚Äôre introverted, you get more tired from hanging out with people. If you‚Äôre extroverted, you get energized from going out.

I also have social anxiety, which is pretty tiring on its own, but I know that even with people I‚Äôm very comfortable with, I still lose energy from being with them after awhile. I always prefer doing things alone than with friends, but I‚Äôm still human, and humans are naturally social, so I do get lonely from time to time. Then I might consider finding a friend to talk to for a little bit.

Not sure if you‚Äôre really introverted or extroverted, but your anxiety/depression is probably a big factor in your energy levels in general, so it‚Äôs harder to tell. It‚Äôs not too important to choose a label, though! Just be whoever you are and work on your mental health :)"

digitalminimalism,fivmz6a,t3_fa1vic,1582763632.0,"Most of these can be accessed on a computer. Unless you go online shopping all the time or sell used clothes frequently, I don‚Äôt think you need letgo, thredup, etsy, trash nothing, or mercari. Bookmark these on your computer and go on them only when you think of something you want to buy/sell.

Netflix/Hulu are nicer to watch on a bigger screen, but if you use them on your phone often they‚Äôre okay to keep. See if you can get rid of one of them though - is there any particular reason you have both?

Discord, VSCO, Pinterest, Reddit, and Tumblr are what I consider social media. Do you need Discord to text people you couldn‚Äôt contact otherwise? Is it easier to text on a computer? VSCO works a bit like Instagram - you post pics and see what your friends are up to. Do you value knowing about their lives or would you rather just see them in person? Do they want you to have a VSCO account or would no one notice a difference? Do you use Pinterest while cooking a new recipe or trying new crafts or do you just look for cute hairstyles, nail art, and room decor ideas? Would you ever really try any of them or are they just nice to look at? Would it be better to look at them on a computer? Reddit mobile is better in my opinion, but if you‚Äôre on it for hours at a time, it might be a good idea to get rid of the distraction. And lastly, Tumblr - do you really need 24/7 access to it or can you wait until you get home to a computer to browse it?

Libby and Wattpad can be fun to read unless you rarely have time to read or you prefer print books. Depends on you, but they‚Äôre okay to keep in my opinion.

Lastly, Fiverr, cash app, and Paypal. Oh, and Spotify. Spotify is fine unless you rarely listen to music outside of your home. Fiverr seems a lot more efficient on a computer, but if you use it on your phone often, that can work too. Do you need to make transactions and buy/sell things often? Keep cash app and Paypal if you do."

If you want to develop a habit, like meal prepping, 30 min of language learning, or just flossing daily, you can come up with all sorts of reasons for those as well.

It‚Äôs a lot easier to think of areas in your life you want to improve. If you want to be healthy, you can list all the things that would help and then work on them, one by one. If you want more time to relax and de stress, list things that could help with time management (like waking earlier, using Pomodoro method to get work done, or creating a chore schedule). Having a reason is good motivation for staying consistent with your goals. Hope this helps :) Good luck!"

On the other hand, if you find out you‚Äôre quite good at it, you could develop an interest - but this isn‚Äôt guaranteed.

If you‚Äôre interested in art and film, think about less common careers in those fields. Chances are, you‚Äôre not ambitious enough to be some famous movie director or a popular graphic designer. Find out what else is available. Can you do digital art? You could freelance and design logos, banners, or posters. Do you have experience in editing videos? Photography? Writing? Do you want a structured office job with more repetition and monotony (like accounting) or would you prefer something more hands-on (architecture, graphics design, carpentry)? You could also consider learning a trade in that case, since plumbers and the like often get paid very well.

For college, just focus on getting your basics done. That should take two years, which is plenty of time to research careers. There‚Äôs no need to pick a permanent one right now. People change their majors and career paths all the time."

You can try to focus on what to look forward to in the future - what colleges are you interested in? Are there any hobbies or subjects you enjoy? You could find a university with much nicer people and make real friends there. You can work hard now and make yourself a much better future without bullies and toxic people. The school I go to doesn't have many bullies, if any - it's entirely possible that there are colleges that are the same, or that you could reinvent your social status there. Keep your head up.

You could try writing out a daily agenda.
