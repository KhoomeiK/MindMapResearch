I'm STILL on the journey 10 years later I started when we separated but it's brought so much to my life and I am now conscious of the path I'm on and much more attuned with trusting its guidance. If this is the path of your soul just know that it will be a long dark time but there will be so much waiting for you along the way. Don't expect that you'll get over it like a regular relationship.

Our seperation was so painful we have still not spoken in 10 years after our breakup !! Nothing! We can't. I have theories obvs. Haha. One weird thing we noticed together was we had the exact same fingernails. Like to look at our hands you'd never tell but when we stacked them on top and compared nails they are identical and was a cool party trick. Both married to soul mates now and very happy.

I am an empath, lucid dreamer, and I think I've been astral projecting in my dreams. I've had premonition dreams, I always know what gender the baby is going to be whenever someone's pregnant lol. I can read people like a book and sense their energy and pain. People confess their secrets to me and are naturally drawn to me espec when my energy is high. I've had some success with telepathic communication just by tuning in to their frequency. I can sense energy distribution in someone's body and where there are blocks.

adhdwomen,f2ycvvw,t3_deo66d,1570489312.0,"I got diagnosed at 26, am 30 now. And it saved my life. Honestly. It was like there was an answer to a question I didn't realize I'd always been asking which is why is this so.much.harder.for.me than everybody else. It helps so much to have the vocab and the tool list to start helping yourself instead of spinning out of control at all times. I did 2 undergrads and almost 2 master's degrees in a row but I burnt out and became non-functional before I could start the short final project after a year of classwork. It helps explain me to me and to everyone else. It has helped my life immensely and I'm still processing how much this information affects my whole past and obviously my present. I hope you can come to a good place with your diagnosis. Mine came out of the blue even though it was obvious in retrospect since early childhood. It's helped me to work past my unhealthy coping mechanisms and substitute them with healthier ones. I.e in order to sit and work I'd get stoned and chain smoke cigs and over eat so I wouldn't have to deal with the hyperactivity part and I gained a tonnnn of weight but I realized I was sedating myself in order to sit and focus for long periods of time etc. Now I dance around the house to get the energy out but still it's hard. I'm getting a gym pass so I can swim or work out but honestly it's hard the more energy I burn the more I have and it's hard to sit still without smoking weed or cigs.

Edit: Oh forgot to mention I'm a creative writer and English major both undergrad and grad. I wrote a novel unmedicated. And written and edited several thousand pages of essays, stories, poems etc. It's not that we can't do the things, it's that we struggle to the brink of failure/exhaustion to keep up with our brains and force it to constantly work at a defecit. We get secondary and tertiary mental illnesses usually from all of this plus trauma and almost certainly depression and anxiety needlessly. I wish I was diagnosed earlier to save myself all of that through school and life, but obviously I can't. What the diagnosis helps me to do is undo the coping mechanisms I used to survive and stop just surviving (I used to say i was like someone always treading water and just making it to the surface for air, bobbing up and down in that panicked place.) But now I'm starting to thrive with healing and knowledge and fucking meds!

I hope wherever your journey takes you that you don't feel shame or stigma about these four-letters but triumph and pride at your accomplishments. Wishing you the best!"

I love cold water. Happily jump in like a lil dumb penguin. Immediately start going into shock. It feels like my entire body is being pressed and pulled apart. It doesn't feel cold. It just feels PAIN. Forgot about the whole rafting thing and am now BEGGING for my life to be pulled back into raft and of course my friend in the raft is practicing how to pull someone in safely. My brain is gone into a hybrid of fight and flight and I'm full on trying to will myself out of the water. She finally pulls me back into the raft.

Anytime I had a long string I'd my feet and legs up. I liked the feeling and I felt really great in my fake sandals. I liked the way my legs looked all wrapped up. My mom also had a huge wrapping leg brace I used to like to strap on from ankle to hip. And walk around in or just wear. 

Turns out as an adult I like being tied up and/or restrained, and sensory deprived too. It was nothing sexual as a kid but I think I felt comforted by being tied and or wrapped like tight hug. And I liked how my legs looked but it wasn't sexual more like aesthetically pleasing like a kaleidoscope I'd twist and turn my calves in different lights to see the effect of the string patterns intersecting with my skin. 

I also used to draw on my hands or thighs a lot in school. And now I'm covered in tattoos. I think there's a thread that connects us to what we like later on but I think we are drawn to them innocently enough. Just because it's tied to sex doesn't mean we don't necessarily do that with all of our personality traits as adults like aversion to certain foods or liking certain childhood toys still etc."

AstralProjection,evwxgiz,t1_evdjdys,1564876026.0,"Sorry for the late reply. I wanted to sincerely thank you for your response and I'll be looking more into the tribes and other things you mentioned. I think maybe I've been loafting on responding is because I genuinely am struggle with this dream issue and it's pretty intensely personal and difficult to describe. But I'm going to try haha. I'm going to use numbers just to help myself keep my brain straight. 

1. I have been lucid dreaming since around 4-5 years old. I think I may have been open to beyond the veil and it frightened me so I shut out everything paranormal or psychic my whole life until the last 5 years or so. I'm turning 30 in a few days. I had a deeply Catholic childhood and felt an intense connection with Jesus and his example to be kind and righteous and loving always. I had a really abusive childhood and adolescence so in order to control some of the world around me I prayed intensely and a lot. It manifested with OCD as a young kid and by 10-14 years old I would fall asleep praying every night specific prayers with all my intent sometimes for 2-3 hrs because I had to stop and restart everytime I lost focus or misspoke. In an effort to stop this and other OCD behaviours I stopped praying altogether, became atheist, and came to terms with the scientific view of life and death. 

2. This is all relevant because eventually I would get diagnosed ADHD at 26 and then be able to cope with some of my trauma and coping mechanisms. I started meditating as a method to calm down and it opened me back up spiritually again. A path I am still on and though apprehensive at times I do believe quite radically differently to my previous atheist or Catholic experiences. The biggest thing I learned is that without nurturing the spirit, which I had been denying myself, I was stunted and couldn't grow wholly as a mind and body or emotions. That one doesn't necessarily have to believe in any one thing but everyone must nurture their soul and their connection to all things and find their way towards their highest self and their souls purpose of happiness, love, and service to the greater world. 

3. I realized that my earlier prayers were a version of meditation, albeit a grueling one. As my spirit opened I saw my connection and fear of the beyond as a scared child not being willing to venture into the very intense psychic and spiritual experiences she was having and shut it all down. I've healed a lot from my traumas and im the best I've ever been health and emotion wise though there's always more learning and obstacles in life as we are always growing hopefully more deeply into ourselves. ADHD kids have a really hard time falling asleep and I did especially. My dad had to come sleep in my bed until I was 12 because I'd be so frightened and anxious. Plus my waking life was stressful and exhausting. All of which leads me to the nightmares. 

4. I've had nightmares every night since I can remember. From generally anxious dreams to gruesome and painful horror movie type experiences. As I've grown spiritually so has my lucidity and my control. I use/d a lot of weed to cope and cigarettes which doesn't decrease or increase the nightmares but it reduces my control and amount of lucidity per night. I'm actually writing a screenplay based on them because it's literally like living a double life. A day life and and night life. I've died so many times at night, felt dream versions of pain over and over etc. It writes itself haha. 

5. In the last 10 years I've had dreams about my ex boyfriends. Please don't dismiss this as I'm not over my exes like everyone does which is part of the problem I have explaining this and its intensity. You have to understand that these guys were my lifeline. The first stability I ever had and I spent all of my limited free time at their houses with them and their families. I dated S for 3 years and then B for almost 3 years too. Both were formative relationships in my life and crushing losses. Especially with B who I think is my twin flame. Twin in the sense of coming together and it being overwhelming and intense but then parting and going on to become the person you're supposed to be and usually not in contact with. There's more but I'm prefacing. Anyways both S and B and I found our soul mates and we are all married. Interestingly S is the name of B's wife and B and my husband have the same name and we all got married within a few days of each other, me first and then the guys two years after. I'm not in contact with either but I miss them both dearly as friends and would love to be able to hang with them and even their spouses. 

6. In the last 5 years I've been revisiting the same cities and country sides. In my dreams I can fly anywhere at will. There are recurring elements but the only two people I interact with regularly are S and B and it's very different to the NPC that I can interact with and influence when lucid and in control (see: weed part 4). Especially with B the dreams are constant it's been 10 years! We haven't spoken. We both moved on. I live across the country. I've reconciled much worse in myself than wanting to go back in time and be with my ex's. I'm super happy where I am and I accept everything happened when it was supposed to and how. The dreams with B change sometimes I'm chasing him sometimes I'm avoiding him. Sometimes we talk and it's like everything in the whole world is okay again. It's an unreal peace but not like I've heard described like a guide or a higher self. It's relief. It's joy. That we're finally back together. Not even in the romantic sense. Just like in the same room sitting next to each other and talking. Omg. My heart skips a beat just thinking about it. And it's okay for a moment. We're just bffs getting along like we always did. We ended because we had to and it was right in that moment but we fell in love hard and we're best friends like we'd known each other always despite growing up in the same circles but never talking until when we did it was like being hit with a truck. Even our fingernails were identical it was eerie. We broke up and never talked again. So yes because it's intense and it was important event people just go well you're clearly in love with him that's why. 

6. I'm not in love with him! My ex S appears in my dreams too and he's always pissed at me like he is irl. Both their spouses or versions of them appear a lot and the thing is these girls are perfect for them. I love them both and myself enough to know that all became the best person we could be and with the best partners we could have. I'd love to be friends irl or even online with B, S and I at least have each other on insta so there's no communication but I can keep up with his life. I love my husband and when I have these constant dreams with them, and the intense clarity of B and being with him and being ""together"" again it's overwhelming. I feel guilty even though my husband knows I have no control over it. I don't want to be accused of wishful thinking but something about it seems deeply psychic and the whole never speak again thing is wildly dramatic. But it feels like much more. I've had psychic dreams/feelings before too but they related to specific things happening irl. But S and B especially are total strangers. I know nothing about B's life except I watched his stunning wedding video online. And I was okay with it! It wasn't my wedding which was perfect for me especially the groom lol, it was their wedding and they have wildly different values to me and my husband. 

I'm sorry if this is too much. Obviously this is why I was anxious to go into detail but this is a real issue for me and I just have no idea where to find out what is going on. I had one with B just last night after a few days of respite from the Ex dreams et Al. 10 years is crazy and way too long for me to having such intense constant dreams of S and B especially. The nightmares suck so much but honestly I dread the B dreams the most. I wake up next to my perfect husband like wtf is wrong with me. I don't know you get out of my head. If you or anyone gets this far and has anything to comment or advice or resources I'd really appreciate them. Humbly thanking you."
awakenedliving,evdlms0,t3_cjbgch,1564441263.0,"I'm in no means an expert but I grew up with conditional love only and have come to be able to give and receive unconditional love to my partner, friends, and family. 

I want to say that with all of this I still feel that I need to live up to a certain standard to receive love. I feel that to love me certain conditions must be met. I know that's not true but our brains are powerful and so is trauma and conditioning. 

Setting boundaries: unconditional love starts with boundaries ironically. Yours and those you love. It means accepting them and yourself with conditions and still choosing to love them and act with love. 

For instance my partner has seriously trauma that expresses itself in an inability to talk about feelings. I mean absolutely 0 ability. It took 3 years for me to understand how hard that limit was. And then I accepted it. I said well if you have 0% in this area, and I have 90% so I will take on that load for us to help you. In return, I have hard limits from trauma where I have 0% to give and my partner picks up my slack. 

I have friends with whom I disagree about their choices but I respect their difficulty in that aspect of their self. I establish my boundaries for instance with a friend of mine who I love dearly but is struggling with mental illness which makes her toxic ATM. I say to myself what is the loving act here to her and myself. Talking on the phone or telling her about my concerns are two big triggers and pretty much all she wants me to do is support her manic decisions. I had to stop talking to her on the phone but I've started writing letters and sending her memes. 

My parents are unhealthy. I eventually didn't see them for two years and in that time I worked on myself and healed and tried to establish what was acceptable and not acceptable to me. But when I finally saw them there was still a lot of ego in all of us. We bickered immediately. My dad wouldn't let me in. My mom was putting on a great show. 

I realized I had to show the love I wanted to receive. I hugged my dad. Let myself cry in front of him and told him how much he means to me. In return he let his defences down over time as I continued to pour love into him. Same with my mom. We had a great visit. In that case I had the love to give, the ability to set my own ego aside (genuinely) and be vulnerable because they couldn't. If I hadn't taken those two years I wouldn't have had the ability to do that. 

I hope these anecdotes help. It's hard to express the action of healing or quieting ones ego. Practice makes perfect."
AstralProjection,evdj93v,t3_cje3q1,1564439578.0,Natural lucid dreamer here. I think I've been also astral projecting in my dreams but have no control over where or when either awake or asleep.

adultsurvivors,escsb3j,t3_c6zybi,1561837582.0,"I'm sorry this sucks. There's not much more to say. It's awful what happened to you and it's awful what happened to me and for so many of us. 

One thing that helps me is to realize that everyone is born in to circumstances beyond their control. You were born into violence and abuse. I was born into abuse. Some are born into poverty or illness. Some people have magical childhoods and traumatic stuff happens to them when they're older. 

1. It's not fair. It's not fucking fair. It's not fair. 
2. It cannot be changed. Everything that happened to you happened (I personally believe in everyone having a journey in their life, struggles they overcome to learn and grow). Whenever I get stuck in #1 I remember #2 and go back to #1. It's not fair. I acknowledge that. It can't change. I acknowledge that. It still wasn't fair or right. 

I'm not sure this is a great relationship for you at the moment. You're in the shit and digging your way out of it will take probably your whole life in different ways. BUT it's your life now you have some control over it unlike in your youth. Make your life what you want it's okay to be selfish as in doing things that will make you happy. Being selfish doesn't mean hurting people. You can't fix your partner's trauma by being monogamous... It will fail in the end if you're holding back yourself to protect her. If you do break up you can be gentle and loving as best as you can. You can break up with someone lovingly even though you know it might hurt them. It is the fairest thing you can do for both of you. She might need this relationship to end so she can grow in her life as well. So figure out what you want and try to live the most authentic life you can now that you've reached a place in your healing when you can notice that you want more for yourself and your life. Best wishes to you."

AskReddit,eqsektx,t3_bzb3f1,1560283104.0,"Okay normally I wouldn't contribute gruesome to stories on reddit but because I spent 2 hours reading this thread it's only right to pay it forward. 

The brothers of this guy I knew: one was a  firefighter and his other brother was a cop. I was young like 12-18 when I knew him so his stories made a big impression on me (he was my athletic trainer). I KNOW THERE WERE TWO STORIES but for some reason I can only remember one right now. 

Brother shows up at the scene of a suicide at an airport. Apparently it's kind of a problem people killing themselves by jumping off a height in airports so there's lots of security measures to keep people from going through with the impulse.

Well this one lady managed to jump from a substantial height. But instead of jumping headfirst like diving into a pool, she did a pencil jump off and went feet first into asphalt. 

Because of the impact her feet were crushed and blown out. But the ground was also fairly soft considering. So her legs ended up impaled in the ground and her corpse was standing more or less like a scarecrow. The details are fuzzy but it must have blown out up to her knees and her femurs were the bones staked in the ground. In my childhood recollection I forgot to imagine that knees would bend under the weight of a body."
AskReddit,eqsbkj6,t1_eqs853n,1560281150.0,Not enough upvotes. Post-Partum Depression is very real and can end in suicide of the mother. But it's Post-Partum Psychosis that crosses the line from harming oneself to harming their child/children as well. The urge to protect one's children is so strong that it take PP Psychosis to cross that boundary. Though lack of sleep induced psychosis could also be at work in this particular situation.
Advice,eqs69uo,t3_bzd4si,1560277677.0,Eat as much heavy food as you can like fries or burger. Don't drink caffeine. Drink water. Avoid drawing attention to yourself. If someone asks if you're okay just say you're really exhausted because you haven't slept for a few nights in a row and you're not feeling well and pretty out of it. Relax. Try and forget about it. You're gonna be fine.

socialskills,eqaw8fh,t1_eq8nw7x,1559941032.0,"It's always going to be hard to get involved in a pre established group. I became friends with a friendgroup in my early 20s and you definitely have to fit the dynamics of their friendship if you're hanging out with them. For instance my parties don't usually involve any video games but their parties revolved around video games. Eventually one guy in the group had a problem with my SJW and Feminism posts and now none of them are friends with me. It sucks because I lost some lovely friends but also doesn't suck because I don't want to be friends with people who are gross to minorities and women. 

Infiltrating established groups is always going to come with some compromise. I'd suggest ignoring established groups and try to build your own by making different friends who have lots in common with you and like to do the same things. New relationships and new groups of acquaintances have to establish their own dynamic based on the personalities involved. So if you guys are already compatible then your dynamic as a group will settle into something that is beneficial for all of you. Pre established groups already have their dynamics settled and sometimes have years and years of practicing that particular dynamic. People can come in and out of the group so long as the core aspects of the friendship stays the same or has evolved naturally over time from the original group dynamics. Anyone who doesn't fit in to this dynamic will inevitably end up outside the group. Some groups have more rigid and more flexible dynamics but generally it's like joining a pre established set of social rules that you had no part making. So joining groups will always have some of the flaws you've described. Focus on making a couple quality friends because those relationships will give as much to you as you put into them because you get to decide the dynamic together as you go."
socialskills,eqaungc,t1_eq8q4bp,1559940228.0,Yeah don't call them out it will only make them go Super Saiyan. Definitely read up about narcs and personality traits but don't provoke them by calling them out it's the worst thing you can do. Honestly my advice is to kill 'em with kindness. If someone is being shitty to you it drives them crazy if you seem to not notice it and are consistently polite and nice to them. And they'll probably leave you alone if they're not getting a rise out of you. How does this person's dynamic change based on the personalities around them? Who are they sweet as pie to and who do they dominate? How do other people interact with this person? Narcs at work are one of the main interactions people have with narcs outside of being related or in a relationship with them. So there's lots and lots of resources about dealing with narc coworkers available to you!
socialskills,eqau3sf,t1_eq8qm3g,1559939934.0,Friendly chit-chat is a skill that's really useful. If you can't have short and sweet polite interactions with people it's hard to build into a closer relationship. Practice practice. Try to keep interactions short so you can get in an out and there's not too much room for your brain to get squirmy. There's no amount of advice that can help more than exposure. The city I live in now it's common for strangers to make chit chat. I've gotten sooooo much better at it because it's normal here. Back home no one talks to each other without a reason so it's definitely a skill that can go unused or be used really often depending on your environment.
socialskills,eqatphk,t1_eq8yjqs,1559939725.0,Yep that's cool but you're talking to her for a date. If you went up to a guy your age in Publix and asked him to come play video games with you it probably wouldn't go as well. Maybe it would. Idk.
socialskills,eqatkct,t1_eq9bbux,1559939649.0,"Try to include them in group conversations with eye contact but don't force them to talk. If you're talking one on one then make the effort to be the talker and don't force them to respond. Quick and friendly chat where you're doing most of the work. If you can build up trust that you don't expect them to necessarily talk much back and that you accept them how they are, over time they might open up to you more because you're a safe and inclusive person."
socialskills,eq8dbpw,t1_eq7l56k,1559863267.0,That's inner confidence and no one but you can fix that. There's no amount of external validation that can quiet that voice but you.
socialskills,eq8d0z9,t1_eq8cds1,1559863118.0,"There's a lot that impacts that including your culture, you, the other person. Yes people do get picked up places but only people who are looking to pick up or to be picked up. Don't wander the aisles at the grocery store looking for a tennis partner it's not going to go well. Don't look at an entire lecture hall of people and go wow no one wants to be my friend. Do you want to be everyone's friend? No probably only a handful of people in that class you'd actually click with. Also if you're a PUA don't ask a woman for sex openly in a mall on PUA day. It's happened to me where multiple men did this at a mall and it was absolutely disgusting."
socialskills,eq8cjy6,t1_eq87wi7,1559862879.0,It's all about the energy you give off. It means being even more vulnerable than everyone around you because you're open and welcoming in your self and you have enough energy to fuel everyone in the groups energies. It's a lot of power and it's draining so practice makes perfect. You know that sweet spot where you're just killing it and everybody is laughing with you. Learn how to control and command that energy but don't smother other people's attempts to add their own energy to the dynamic. It's like being a maestro of people when done well and with empathy. It's the same kind of observation and understanding of people that narcs use to manipulate. So only use your powers for good if you're the magnetic type. Because if you're that good with people you could seriously hurt them or impact their lives if you were a bastard. So good positive loving vibes only.
socialskills,eq8bybm,t1_eq7ye5s,1559862568.0,This person sounds like a real douche. Ignore their petty behaviour and get on with the business you have to accomplish by interacting. They do it because they can see it affects you negatively and that affects them positively. Look up grey rock technique and other narcissist techniques that help you to not feed the supply. They will change behaviour if you are no longer feeding their narc supply. It's a tricky one and try not to go toe to toe with them. I have a lot and I can because I grew up with one. But it's dumb and only puts you in danger in the end. Narcs = bad news bears.

socialskills,eq8b54q,t1_eq62wqf,1559862141.0,"I wasn't born this way exactly. I was born into circumstances that dictated some fundamental lessons to me very young. First being if no one in your life is going to help you you need to figure it out on your own. Second: bullies don't bother you as much even if the bullying is really bad, when all the adults in your life are the really scary bullies with no limits to their behaviour, unlike school which is a relatively safe place. Third: I learned to value myself for my hard work and accomplishments. I set my own goals and worked hard to achieve them. If no one tells you you're a good kid or worthy person then you learn to find your self worth internally rather than externally. I got good grades so to me they were objective measurements of something valuable (knowledge) that helped me find confidence in myself."

socialskills,eq8a7cm,t1_eq5xksp,1559861659.0,Yeah I can see how this is a tough line to define and practice will help. But generally try to stick to basic emotions and common or shared experiences. Offer your own anecdotes too and people will open up with theirs. Don't ask them personal questions you wouldn't want to be asked. Keep things light and read the situation. If you're at a bar then you can have more personal intimate conversations. If you're at a work meeting keep it light and on topic. Did they go on holiday this summer? Don't ask why or why not it's not your business. Did you watch the big game? What did you think? Not what hospital were you born at as a baby and how is your relationship with your mom?
socialskills,eq89ktl,t1_eq5w1iy,1559861339.0,"By having a clear understanding of yourself. It's normal to match frequencies with someone. It's not normal to become a whole different person. Practice practice spending time with yourself and in socializing. The act of socializing is the end of itself. You do it because it's practice at connecting with people, learning about them and trading stories and experiences, because your brain lights up with happy vibes when you're engaged with other people, and because you gain from being around loved ones. If you're not getting anything from socializing it's time to do some deep work on yourself or on the problem or get new friends. Friends should add to your life not drain from your life."
socialskills,eq8946z,t1_eq5qea7,1559861115.0,"This is tough because the person sounds like they are not reading your social cues to changes the subject. You can ask questions to help them expand on the problem. Avoid I statements. Say things like wow that is such a hard situation. What kind of strategies have you tried? And then switch topics yourself or leave. If they are looking for sympathy or advice then just do your best by listening. But some people just like to moan, misery loves company but you don't have to entertain it if you don't want to."
socialskills,eq7ys30,t1_eq5q9n7,1559855590.0,"So just because I'm super good at socializing doesn't mean I always want to or even can. I call myself an extroverted introvert. Talking to people takes energy and gives energy. At the end of socializing I'm exhausted and I don't want to talk to anyone until I come back down. It's like a draining high buzzing that needs alone time to relax. But every one needs some kind of social interaction. I've been Truly Lonely TM before many times and human contact is invaluable. But So is managing your time and energy. If my friend wants to come over right now and I just can't that day I take a raincheck. And I'm also cool when other people cancel because we have shit going on. Sometimes I have to drag myself to see people and then once I'm there I'm usually the life of the party. Then I go home and hang out by myself while my husband also decompresses. So know your limits, have boundaries, notice the effects socializing has on you both good and bad and try to organize hangouts to best suit both your needs. I.e short visits at someone's house. A long day together doing things. Meeting up at restaurants or doing a sport or activity together. And different friendships will have different needs and wants. Some people I HAVE to see in small doses. Some people are toxic and I don't want to get to know them very well. Some people don't count as people and you can hang for hours doing nothing."
socialskills,eq7xf9u,t1_eq7wpll,1559854918.0,Actually it's doubly nice to compliment a trans person or gender queer person with a compliment about their style or outfit. You're indirectly valuing their sense of self without referring to gender at all. Don't say that dress makes you look feminine and you totally pass! It's not cool to clock someone. Say that jacket really suits you! Or your make up is really on point today. Compliments work best when they are specific and now. It's weird to be like I've been watching the way you dress and you're good at fashion overall keep that shit up. It's more sincere to say those pants are killer or you're whole outfit is awesome I love the shoes/purse/coat/scarf whatever you're wearing it looks great on you!
socialskills,eq7wpll,t1_eq78nc3,1559854567.0,"I tried to keep in mind heterobro friendships and female to female friendships, plus male female, colleagues, gay or lesbian or trans. So some are a little more feminine yes but that's for female identifying people. Hetero Male Friendships TM are even harder because there's lots rules and boundaries you can't cross. So try to keep things interests related at first instead of complimenting their looks. I love telling men and women that they are really fashionable or I like their whole outfit put together. Compliments about appearance work to disarm us. Same with physical touch. Within reason obviously. Not that these compliments are insincere, far from it, instead of holding back when I think some has a nice quality I tell them free of charge. It's nice to boost people's self confidence."

You don't need to assess the area for cleaning supplies. When it happens just say hey I spilled whatever and I was wondering if you had a cloth or some spray I could use. The host will probably help you. Abandoning the cleaning effort won't make a good impression so help as much as you can. Thank them for their help. Make light jokes about being clumsy but not so self deprecating it's awkward. 

Say thanks for helping me clean up. That's always such a night mare at parties and it could have been a lot worse. ALSO if you throw a party people will spill stuff. Notice how they react and act how you would want to be treated in the situation. Would you want to be made to feel worse about it or that it happens and it's okay. My friend one time tore a huge hole in my coat. I said it's just a coat no worries. Because while I would feel horrible if I had done it to her I would want to be treated with kindness back. She also spilled a whole glass of champagne on me during our friend's wedding and I got to change out of my bridesmaids dress early lol. So acting how you would want to be treated on either side of the situation that will help during awkward moments."

socialskills,eq7bqtj,t1_eq6kx7x,1559844017.0,"This question has come up a couple times in the thread so it's a totally valid one. 

I'm the kind of person who everyone gravitates to. In a group of friends I'm Bffs with everyone individually and in the group. I honestly make weddings and parties easier for other people because I naturally conduct conversations for the group and include people in the group. I am super funny and charming. I'm a Leo. When I'm ON it's like moths to a flame and I'm the flame. Sometimes I feel like magic because I can make people so happy and confident in themselves from the interactions I have with them. Being around me people feel comfortable to share their secrets and fears and to open up their silly selves.  People often confess to me things that are weighing on their soul because they recognize that I'm a safe and loving soul who will accept and appreciate them. I give compliments freely and sincerely. I have a big laugh and a big presence even though I'm only 5 ft tall. I am smart and witty and kind. I can talk to anyone about anything. 

I hope this doesn't come off as bragging. But I am proud of these qualities because I've worked to develop them. I like being a loving energy in the world. I like that people are drawn to me and feel safe around me. I'm a rare bird though. So I see how people react around me and I know that its different from how they usually interact around people who aren't like glowing with love and light. I am refuge for people this is how I know that most people are fairly shy. Not many people are as outgoing and radiating friendly energy like I do. So I see you all and I love helping foster happiness and connections with people. 

But I am how I am because of my childhood and trauma. I have a gift that came from a dark place. So don't beat yourself up if you're not like this. This is my path and my journey and everyone's is different."

socialskills,eq7a0g6,t1_eq6udvi,1559843159.0,"It happens and it happens to me all the time. I just acknowledge it like what was I saying? my mind just went blank. It happens to everyone. Making a little joke about it is totally cool and move on. Same for any social faux pas. Laugh at yourself not in a self deprecating way but like Haha what was i even saying? Who knows lol. What were we talking about again? 

Just acknowledge the glitch and get back on topic. It's only as embarrassing as you let it be. And honestly no one will judge you if you acknowledge it first and laugh it off. They will follow your tone. So if you're like omg I'm a mess don't look at me I'm so embarrassing and I just want to evaporate on the spot right now! They will feel that too and respond accordingly. Also make allowances when others trip up in conversations. Often we only notice ourselves doing it but it's super common. And English is clunky so there's lots of pauses and uhms and ahs. Listening to other people and seeing how they correct themselves when they trip up is important because 1. you'll notice that it's not just you 2. see different ways of handling that situation. Did they make you uncomfortable by overdoing it? Or was their correction so seamless you hardly noticed? Probably the latter and the more you notice the normal blips in conversations the less jarring it feels when you do it."
socialskills,eq78m83,t1_eq73nqm,1559842422.0,"Not always. And when I do go to parties I need lots of downtime after to myself. Or if I've hung out with friends then I need some down time to kind of come back down. That's totally normal. Sometimes I don't want to go be social and stay at home and watch Netflix. So advice number one if you have to go a party and you honestly would rather be a burrito in bed then self care looks like being the burrito and not forcing yourself to be social. 

However I do like parties and I've thrown a lot of them. Some parties and people suck that's a given. Parties can be a great way to meet friends of friends and expand your social group. Always find people on Facebook if you have it from tagged pictures etc. People are more open next time if you've met and now are friends online. Don't add them two weeks later. The next day is fine. 

Y'all this is going to seem counterproductive but smoking cigarettes is a huge social gathering place. It's much more intimate and there's usually an unspoken pact of smokers. If you don't smoke then go out with your friends who smoke. It's a nice way to get much closer much more quickly with a few people at the party. Smoking is also good for taking sensory breaks lol I get overwhelmed in lots of noise and people. Don't start smoking lol. Alternatively take a short walk, go to the yard for a few minutes or take respite in the bathroom for a minute. Decompressing is helpful at parties because lots of people is stimulating and draining to everyone. 

Say you're not super comfortable talking to people at party. Be an obvious listener. Participate in the conversation with your attention and make eye contact with those who are talking. Your participating presence will be felt, acknowledged and included. 

Party people usually break down like this: 

A few social butterflies, maybe a comedian or two. There might be some dominating personalities as well. 

Most people are somewhere in the middle. They might feel uncomfortable introducing themselves. Introduce yourself first and ask questions to further the conversation. MOST PEOPLE likely won't have the confidence to introduce themselves to you unprompted but actually want to be introduced to you. People are almost always happy to answer questions and return their part of an introduction. 

I have a devil's time remembering names. Say you meet someone and then a couple hours later you see them alone or with another person. A great way to reinstate contact is going up to them and saying ""hey I know we just did this but I met so many people tonight that I've already forgotten your name"".  It shows you care about who they are, you remembered their other interaction with you and it's an easy ice-breaker. Then if you don't know their friends you can introduce yourself to them too. Don't underestimate the power of introducing yourself. It's a socially acceptable and perfectly perfect way to instigate contact. That short little back and forth can lay the groundwork for your relationship with these new people throughout the evening and you can buzz around the party meeting new people and getting to know more people better with the simple trick of saying Hi we haven't met before. I'm so and so."

Last night I went to a party and I didn't know most of the people. The best part of new people is the questions you can ask. Where are you from what do you do? These basic conversations are really easier to navigate and helpful practice. 

I was born with some degree of socialness. But I spent my whole like honing those skills and especially from ages 19-25. It was a lot of putting myself in New and uncomfortable situations and learning from them. Socializing is a skill that can be improved with practice and exposure. It is not static and it must be worked through. You have to go through the awkward and uncomfortable to get to the place where your skill has improved."

You don't have to be the comedian but you can appreciate a good joke. If someone is funny or entertaining to a group and someone else is annoyed about it then that person affects the dynamics of the group. So laugh along!

Next step is gradually hanging out. It's a tricky transition but you've built a solid foundation it can be easier than you think. It involves effort going out and meeting that person again outside of the group like a lot. And then once they're your friend it doesn't stop. Relationships are an investment of both of your time and energy and emotional labour. So just let it develop at its own pace."
socialskills,eq71st4,t1_eq5xx88,1559839102.0,Some people retain shit friends because they're too scared to make better ones. Your advice is actually spot on and there's plenty of people in your exact situation.
socialskills,eq71fmx,t1_eq5k186,1559838926.0,"Yes I do! I moved across country 6 years ago lol. 

1. It takes time to make friends. I didn't even meet anyone for 6 months. See my advice about getting to know yourself in that time. It's NOT time wasted it's actually super valuable to your development. 

2. You gotta do the hard part and put yourself out there. Join groups or clubs. Take up a hobby. It seems obvious but let me say this. It is unlikely that you're going to meet people out in the world. It's unnatural and everyone is guarded. If someone came up and made convo with you and then asked to hang out you'd be sketched out and would never call them (** Attention PUAs). 

2a. Don't look at everyone in the world as potential friends. They're not. They're strangers with their own lives and worries. Go where there is socializing. Where introductions are made. IDEALLY a weekly class or regular meet up. Something where you can build relationships naturally and gradually. 

3. Sealing the deal: Let's say you join an improv class (a great challenge for those with social anxiety but I'd argue one of the BEST WAYS TO GET OUT OF YOUR OWN HEAD) and you've met someone you talk to pretty regularly and you want to become friends with that person. 

You have to move the friendship outside of the group. It's kind of like a date. You could say something like hey you want to grab a drink next week after class? Or I was going to do this related thing to our interests this weekend want to come? It might not happen right away people are busy and plans get canceled. It's okay to show interest like hey we never got that drink you down for next week? But if they are trying to turn you down just don't pursue it. They're not interested. If they want to make plans or are keen to hang out then you've got a real potential friendship. 

4. Make friends with people you might not have considered as friends. When I finally met people I ended up in a random group of three friends who were all totally different. But we were all kind and respectful of one another and we found lots of common ground. I never thought these people would become some of my best friends but they did and I'm so lucky."
socialskills,eq6zxj7,t1_eq6azl0,1559838239.0,This is a great point. Reading through some of the threads here feels like people are glorifying other people's social skills. Honestly it's in some degree hard for everybody. I say I'm a social butterfly because it's unnaturally easy for me but because it's so easy to me I can see how hard it is for everyone else. 90% of people are pretty shy honestly. Don't make yourself smaller and everyone else seem bigger because that's 1. false 2. not helpful to you
socialskills,eq6zizu,t1_eq5sdpw,1559838046.0,Okay actually I have ADHD and it affects literally every aspect of my life. I was only diagnosed 3 years ago. So yes this is a joke but if you need medication to function then please I hope you can get it because it is life-saving.
socialskills,eq5g98h,t1_eq5clvx,1559800176.0,"Okay first of all the answer to all is incredibly situational. My first piece of advice is learn how to read body language and non verbal ques. This might be really hard for some people but timing and reading someone's energy as to whether they're even receptive to initiating conversation is huge. 

Timing in a conversation is also really important. As is receptivity. If the person you're talking to is in a rush or seems unenthusiastic about continuing (try to leave, backing up, doesn't offer conversation back) let them go. They might be into it another day or they might just not like you. 

Not everyone is going to like you. A lot of people literally hate me because I project authentic self -confidence that they are trying to project. It's very much a narcissist/empath dynamic that I've fallen into in many situations. Don't sweat it. They probably suck. Not everyone is good people. 

Listen in a conversation. Don't be planning what you're going to say while the other person is speaking. People LOVE to talk about themselves...LET THEM. I passed my drivers license because I asked the exam lady questions about her son and her experience in her job and she happily talked the whole time. I passed with flying colours. People will get turned off if you start with a lot of I statements and only seem interested in yourself. 

Start slow. You can't become friends with everyone and nothing happens all at once. I'm a social butterfly and there have been times in my life when I had no friends. Get to be your own best friend. Yes I went to movies and got food and even went travelling and to plays alone. If you have an authentic relationship with yourself you'll attract similar people. Find something you're interested in and participate in that community. It's the most organic way to meet people. And you're more likely to find people with the same personality types as you. I made the most friends with people who shared my passions and interests. 

I've joined many clubs and taken classes. Sometimes I don't click with anyone and that's cool. Sometimes I meet an acquaintance and a few times I've met a best friend. It's not the number but the quality. If you have one or two friends work on those relationships and learn from them. 

Not everything is easy. There have been many times I'm shy or insecure or have been young and anxious socially. It's normal. Most people feel some degree of social anxiety and nobody feels that relaxed. That's why people like me often become the joiner of people at parties or the entertainer. 

ALWAYS INTRODUCE YOURSELF WITH A HANDSHAKE. Don't make it wimpy or too aggressive. Short and sweet. Physical contact immediately reduces people's defensiveness and opens them up to you. 

Approaching a group. Make your way into the group and hold space by slowly making your full body facing with everyone else. Most groups naturally gather in circles so everyone can see each other's mouths. Don't lurk outside or to the side it's weird. Don't charge in either. Remember timing and reception. If you don't know anyone when there's a gap in the conversation introduce yourself to the person next to you. Say how you're affiliated to the group ""I know So and so from such place"". Often times someone else will be watching you two shake hands and if you catch their eye you can open up to more handshakes and introductions. 

Ask a relevant question. How do you guys know so and so? Or how do you like that class you're all in? 

Asking questions, listening, adding more, allowing them to add something, listening and responding. 

Give non creepy compliments. Nothing opens someone up faster than a well-placed NONSEXUAL compliment. 

Example: hey that was a really good question you asked it really helped me. Don't expect anything in return or even a conversation. Give it as an offering. The next time you meet they will likely be more open to talking with you. 

I love your outfit. This looks amazing on you. Can I just say that haircut suits you so well. 

Or. I just wanted to say that you did a really good presentation. I thought you were really confident while public speaking. 

Be specific not creepy. 

A well timed joke is a great way in. If you're not the joke type then laugh appropriately when others make jokes. People look to see who approves of their humour and will be more open joking with you. 

Have a pleasant look on your face. Smile. Laugh. 

Fake it til you make it. I don't always feel confident. But in situations that demand confidence I make sure to stand or sit up straight and project confidence. The energy your project is really important. If you're freaking out people can feel it and it doesn't feel good does it? Everyone likes someone who has a relaxed and self assured way about them. Even if you don't feel it, look and be the part. Wear fitting clothes and decent shoes. Smell good. If someone is close enough to smell you make sure it smells good. Scent and memory are super tied together and a good scent will linger longer in the memory than you think. 

Shoulder back. Back straight. Head up. Wear sunglasses if you don't like to look people in the eyes but at normal times and not indoors obviously. Nobody is perfect looking but if you're put together neatly then you won't stand out or set off alarm bells. 

Most people are as scared of you as you are of them. Like spiders. Be friendly. Receive friendliness.

Be yourself even if you're weird. Be your weird self and find fellow weirdos. If someone doesn't like you fuck them seriously. Just move on. Cultivate good people by being good people. Be helpful and honest and yourself. Put effort into your relationships. And put effort into your relationship with yourself.

Edit: Thank you for the silver! I wrote this massive essay last night not thinking it would help anyone but I'm really glad people found some valuable advice in it."
Dreams,eq5cnyh,t3_bx7sik,1559797697.0,YEP I'm a writer by trade and I'm currently piecing together a storyline for a Netflix type show about dreaming/my dreams. My dreams are intense and I actually think I've been astral projecting to the same place for a while now. If you're in a consistent universe in your dreams you might be doing the same.
