I would encourage you to not be afraid (as hard as it may sound) and order something yummy if you feel like it! I like the tips other users wrote about ordering from chains instead of local places. It’s true that all it takes is a cough or a sneeze, but every food place is taking every precaution they can, you can nuke it in the microwave or oven if it gives you peace of mind, and I’m *not* letting this virus take away another enjoyable thing for me with all the havoc it’s wreaked on the world.

COVID19_support,fqdzamq,t3_gi5ol6,1589299163.0,"There is ONE thing that Trump has ever said that I agree with, and it’s that we can’t let the cure be worse than the problem. In my opinion, social distancing forever (or even for more than another year or so) would be worse than the initial problem. Imagine the mental toll on those who live alone, don’t get along with the people they live with, or any other people who crave physical contact from those outside of their households. It’s just not sustainable. It’s a short term solution but it can’t be a long term solution if we want to preserve human happiness and the way we were meant to live. I wouldn’t worry about it, because even though it’s hellish right now it can’t be this way forever if we’re all expected to make it through."

relationship_advice,fna666b,t3_g0flm4,1586791773.0,"Hi, OP. I read most of your comments, and I just want to say that you sound a lot like my mom, and this sounds a lot like my family. That’s not a bad thing at all — I love my mom to death, and I would definitely say she’s a good mother. She just never stands up to my dad, who, similar to your husband, is a steamroller with his beliefs. If my mom wants us kids to have locks on our doors but my dad doesn’t, we don’t. If my dad and I are in an argument over something like this (recently we argued because he told me that crying over my college being cancelled is “immature” (I’m 19F)), something that obviously has a reasonable side, she won’t stand up for me at all and stands to the side of the argument like a house plant. 

Growing up, I never wanted anything more than for my mother to stand up for me against the steamroller who is my dad, and now, even though I live at school the majority of the time, it’s made me afraid to get close to my dad or mom because I feel like neither of them have my back. This is exactly the situation that would happen in my household if my dad walked in on me, because I know that as much as my mother supports me exploring my body, my dad doesn’t, and therefore my mom can’t either. 

You need to stop making excuses for your husband’s tyrannical behavior, recognize that he’s plowing over you like a tractor, and tell him what you want to. If he reacts badly, maybe you should rethink your marriage’s effect on family dynamics. And TALK TO YOUR DAUGHTER. It doesn’t matter if you “don’t know what to say”, just tell her whatever’s on your mind because something is better than nothing. Just please do it, because my mother never did and probably never will and maybe that’s part of why I moved out and try to never come home if I can help it."

And thanks for pointing out that yes, he's technically allowed to do whatever he wants with his money, but it doesn't mean he should or that he's not the asshole for using it as leverage against me. It's amazing what people are technically allowed to do that still make them the asshole."

I have a job where I've worked close to 40 hours a week all summer and I've saved a decent amount for personal use. Crazily enough, last summer my dad tried to lay claim to my personal money as well under the logic that because I'm under his rule, my money falls under his jurisdiction. I'm not new to him controlling me at all, I just hate it.

The tattoo that I want is in a discreet, private place where he's unlikely to see it, and it's quite tiny. I'm thinking about a couple larger, more obvious ones, but those are the ones I'd definitely be willing to wait to get. I honestly can't wait to get tattoos and tell him about it and watch him get angry, but there won't be anything he can do. Lol >:)

I'm planning on having a discussion with him before I leave about how his comments and belief he can control me made me feel. I understand that while he's paying for my college I may have to stick to some of his stipulations, but once there's nothing tying me to him, he has no authority over me. I feel kind of gross conceding my autonomy to him while I'm in college, and I'm still going to let him know that everything I do is my decision and my decision alone, but I understand that it's the best way to leave school debt-free.

Right now my plan is to get a small tattoo in a discreet, private area he'll likely never see. Thanks for the judgement!"
AmItheAsshole,ey1j3mz,t1_ey1gkh3,1566701013.0,"Thanks for your judgement. I guess it is pretty minor. What I take more issue with is the control aspect of it. If I let him use the money to get me to do what he wants, what else will he do? Will he force me to go to church every week in order for him to keep paying? Will he try to dictate what I study? I feel disgusting having my education come with strings, and even if the tattoo isn't that big of a deal, certain stipulations he puts on it in the future could be."
AmItheAsshole,ey1iz5d,t1_ey1eorj,1566700918.0,"I think I'll get one anyways, in a private and discreet area which he'll likely never see. He's not really a compromising guy, he's more the ""I'm right and what I say goes"" type. But thanks for the suggestion and the judgement!"
AmItheAsshole,ey1iv9y,t1_ey1ewrm,1566700837.0,"Thank you! I'm very excited to begin attending this week :)

After reading some comments I can see why it would be foolish of me to argue with him. It's worth not having any debt to wait to get a tattoo, I just feel disgusting and powerless being controlled with money. Right now my plan is to tell him I won't get any tattoos and once I'm ready for it, get a small one in an area he won't ever see (I'm thinking upper inner thigh). I know it's rebellious and risky, I just can't let myself be controlled like this by a man stuck in the 1950s."

I'm not religious at all, but my dad is a very ""pious"" Catholic who sticks to the whole ""God made you so you should honor his gift"" thing.

AmItheAsshole,ey1ie88,t1_ey1hkke,1566700482.0,"The ""my body, his money"" argument is why I've seen a lot of comments for NAH. I realize I'm not entitled to his money and in my post I made it sound like I am. Thanks for your judgement."
AmItheAsshole,ey1ib41,t1_ey1eln9,1566700416.0,"Thanks for your judgement. My plan for if I end up getting a tattoo is to get it in a discreet/private place, so there's no risk of it devaluing me in a work environment. I understand that I need to choose freedom versus security, and I think I'm leaning towards security. As gross as it is for my dad to try to control my choices like this, it's true that he controls my financial security after moving out."

I used Macprotecter and it didn't tell me exactly what I was infected with, but it insinuated that I'm in trouble and unprotected (I elaborated a little more in another comment). 

If it helps, my version of MacOS is Mojave 10.14.6

Thank you very much for the links! Very helpful :)"

My plan right now is to do a factory restore and if there's any residual issues, hit up my Geek Squad for help.

I’m just curious how they’ll fit it into Chapter 2 now that they’re all adults, while the original took place while they were kids. I bet they could make it work as adults, it just seems like the foundation of the idea and general childlike execution of an improbable idea worked so much better when it was being pulled off by kids."

I do the same thing where I try to control every part of what we do and plan meticulously, but she helps me ease into letting go and makes it as gentle as possible for me. Sometimes I get so anxious that I need help doing basic things like remembering to eat or take my meds and she’s always always always willing to give me the support I need. I’m always quite nervous that one day she’ll get tired of me leaning on her when my anxiety gets the better of me, but she assures me that day will never come and that she loves me no matter what."
