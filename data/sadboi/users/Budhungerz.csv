This is a good thing... but what concerns me is that essential services that the populous rely on should always belong to the sovereign country (for first world countries this should be viable anyway). Where does one draw the line? I believe, that just as many movies have portrayed with an eerily real vibe to them about futuristic capitalist societies, imo we are heading in that direction. Technology is doing its part to drag us down that path. The movie casting Justin Timberlake titled *In Time* being a quite exxagerated but in part, highly plausible interpretation as to how things could end in the future, if we keep mixing the two potentially volatile compounds together. I really do fear the mix of capitalist (or socialist) ideology and sociopaths in combination. I've already seen what has happened in the last ten years to the society in which I live, mainly regarding stress levels, overall social skills (general attitudes mainly),and the constant distraction of smart technology. I digress.

>Milton Friedmann put it best when he said ""Capitalism per say is not humane or inhumane. Socialism per say is not humane or inhumane.

 A great quote, thanks. 

>Capitalism tends give much freer rein to the more humane values of human beings

If this is so, why does America have such a huge homeless population? America is about as capitalist as a country gets. Given this, why is there no universal health care there?  Australia also operates using capitalism as our economic model. People should be worried because this is the path that we'll inevitably travel down if we keep heading in the direction that we are. As I mentioned just prior, where does one draw the line? This is why I believe that although it's been the best ideology to date, I really do believe that it is going to be our species downfall in time.

>Additionally, you have identified many areas where even the efficiency of capitalism is unable to render just outcomes to the entire population of Australia

It isn't that it's unable to render certain just outcomes, it simply doesn't value them enough. To be frank, the whole point of capitalism is to try and climb to the top of the economic ladder... Where do the people who live with mental health issues fit into this equation? Not everyone is a powerhouse of capability. Terrible mental health is a real entity. It isn't made up for the convenience of those who have to live with it, as some sort of excuse (dare I say this to anyone on the far right). The very definion of capitalism essentially defines their worth then as zero. Why? Obviously this isn't the case. They could have skills in art, the written word and a good heart etc etc, but apparently they're useless. 

This is why at least to me capitalism is to a degree, very evil. It basically has this affinity with ""I've got my race to run so goodluck with yours but im out"", always lingering  just left of centrestage.

Gotcha. But this is only for now, they're on the chopping block just as they once were in America. Putting it tactfully, it would be shortsighted at best to not see this eventual progression. It's been occurring in Australia since the 1990's; Telecom, Etsa, now a portion of Centrelink is now foreign owned as far as I'm aware... so not in concept but in reality, these are three obvious examples of Capitalism in motion. ""What is the point of getting a nice haircut and putting on a nice shirt, if you've got no pants to put on?"" To me this is basically capitalism in an extremely oversimplified definition. Dude's got the best hair cut and shirt in his suburb, he's wanting to go out for the night but he can't because he has no pants or underwear.

How can something be theoretically so beneficial for our society, yet in practice actually be so detrimental to our overall quality of life? I really do hate banging on about it because I've already mentioned it on this sub more than once, but how is the death of my brother because of a lack of funding (clearly if you're in need of rehab, yet the waiting list is 9 odd months), the powers that be obviously don't consider that people who aren't earning enough to pay for their own rehab should have even remotely timely access to public mental health/rehab services. He paid his taxes from 14.5 when he started working at HJ's to 24 when he suicided after just leaving the IT industry to focus on rehabilitation from substance use issues. (and in all probability some unresoved trauma and possibly mental health issues). He had no choice but to call the only publically funded rehab in South Australia, 3 times a week as was required to keep his place, for over 5 months yet devastatingly to no avail. This is what unfortunately always comes to mind whenever I think about capitalism tbh. I see the benefits of capitalism to a fair degree, but ultimately at least to me, the writing is on the wall as to the duality of technology, capitalism and sociopathy ending up being the downfall of ANY semblance of a normal life, such as *In Time* depicts.

>If I was a die-hard utilitarian capitalist, I would posit that the regulation of monopolies or the guarantee of competition, is simply a maintenance of the free market, as under the Austrian school of economics a monopolisation is considered a market failure. 

So paraphrasing the last half of this, the privatisation of our essential services is a market failure then? This is what I'm talking about. It's obvious using this logic, that capitalism is eventually, coupled with technology and sociopaths, going to be the end of any sort of life worth living, even as a capable person (imo).

Regarding the McDonald's thing, I just assumed that you knew because of the movie that was made on the topic. That if you hadn't seen it that you probably would've heard about it from someone anyway. All good.

>Additionally, I would similarly very much like to see the thought experiment of the impersonal company played out. I seem to recall some research on the subject which found a significant correlation between the perceived 'distinctive traits' of a product and its packaging and NOT whether it was actually made by the company it was being presented as.

I was referring more so to the fact that a quality product sells itself, not whether it was made in house, but yes, the 'distinctive traits' of a product, coupled with extremely effective advertising is almost impossible to resist.

>Finally, I am also very much enamoured with the idea of a quality product made by people who really care about what they do. 

Me too. I love anything of quality that has been born from passion; freshly roasted coffee, a glass of basket-pressed red or white wine, a musical instrument etc etc. Passion is actually a cool topic for me.

>When I get the time, I am an amateur mathematician, a field I've loved for quite a while.

(paraphrasing) - a quote from the one of our Government websites I found a couple of weeks ago when replying to another comment on this topic.

It's no fluke that given this is when the record influx of immigration started, that in 2020 (before covid-19 anyway), housing prices were at their highest in actually less than 10 years as the article claims... 9 years to be more accurate.

Edit: some say that immigration has built our recent economy, others could argue that they've actually made it worse.

>I am happy and willing to accept that another model may well be superior. However, if establishing such a society is your goal process of change should always be a gradual one, alterning society procedurally such that the consequences of each gradual change can be analysed, while the overall process can be halted if damage is done.

This is my fear... that there isn't a better model. Capitalism has definitely pulled most 1st world countries into what is now a very enjoyable quality of life to live (compared with earlier times). Yes we've still got b.s. to deal with daily, but it isn't like it used to be. Without capitalism, technology wouldn't have advanced anywhere near as fast as it has.

To quickly get to the point that I was trying to illustrate, it isn't capitalism itself that has been bad for our species per se. What people's concerns at this time are mostly, is that our liberties are continually as the years go by, slowly being stripped from us. Financial security (from gainful employment opportunities/careers) being one of them. Whether it be the amount of hours of work increasing at the cost of time with the family, because the banks have decided to raise interest rates irrespective of recommendations not to, is one example that I hope helps to illustrate my point.

In this example, it isn't Capitalism itself that is the problem per se, but the desire of certain sociopaths to further their agenda of turning even more of a profit, at the cost of the quality of life of people far less capable than them in being able to wear such a change...

Imo, even if it wasn't the intention of Governments at the time, capitalism has merely become the perfect vehicle for sociopaths full of greed to take advantage of the less fortunate, seemingly indefinitely. Contemporary enslavement. It's been like this since the dawn of time in some form or another, the strong taking advantage of the weak.

On another subject, We idolize America but seriously, what's good about America these days? We're heading in their direction and it's not for the betterment of the citizens... The privatisation of our welfare system, public health system, corrections and parole system, all of these things would be on our Government's agenda whether they'd admit it or not. All because the well off don't have enough money. This is why I think that it's more about the mindsets of people than capitalism itself being the issue.

You were right, I was having a bit of a dig at capitalism, it should've been a dig at sociopaths more so. Its just a shame that so many sociopaths happen to be greedy AF by nature (amongst some other things). It's the way in which we're being told that we have to live our lives by these greedy sociopaths, actually, for these sociopaths being more appropriate that's the problem...

For example; people need shelter, but why can't a person build essentially a nice looking home from shipping containers etc? Cheaper, allows the person to have more financial freedom instead of servitude... can be made into very energy efficient homes... The neighbours would be up in arms! ""What an ugly looking house, how dare they devalue my 6 bedroom, three bathroom..."", overpriced pile of steel and plasterboard that's excessive to do the job, when we know how some are sleeping in some countries... even in our country.

I'm not saying that socialism is the answer here, but given that most can see that resources aren't going to be around (or affordable) forever, why aren't we being more considerate of those that haven't been as fortunate in this life as others, and allow that different looking, yet far more financially and materially practical home to be built  on an otherwise Pleasantville street? Where are the rights for people who rent? In South Australia, most rooms to rent don't even come with a lease (unless you find a legitimate share house). This is what I'm talking about; how can something so fundamentally important for a person who doesn't own their own home, be neglected? To have a little security e.g. 12 months of not being turfed out over not cleaning the bathroom when the other housemates get preferential treatment because they get along with the owner's son who also lives there, better than you do (all made up from a hypothetical example), imo another example of capitalism being the perfect vehicle for the haves to take away from the have-nots. How is it that we have put man on the moon, made vehicles that travel at more than the speed of sound, but Australia can't make a law to make sure that private tenants must have leases, even for a bedroom in a share house, no matter it's size? (Even one renter in an otherwise family home)

Capitalism isn't the enemy itself, just the perfect vehicle for sociopaths to continue getting their way, indefinitely.

I enjoyed reading your example of Mc Donalds being a restaurant ""that does actually care"". The fact that playgrounds exist at their restaurants was only an attempt to get more families eating there for the family meal, as opposed to fast food for a hungry, tired worker looking for a quick bite on their way home to their tv, pet, family, hobbies etc, not because they cared about us.

As you're probably aware the very concept of McDonald's was stolen from a couple of well-meaning brothers who may have appeared a bit simple, but who were making history, whilst serving great quality food for the money, very fast at the time. Stolen by an extremely greedy person, definitely with some sociopathic tendencies who was constantly trying to find cheaper ways to make that same food that wasnt even his idea, cheaper and turn yet a larger profit.

I may not be a tertiary educated person, but I'm always happy to engage with anyone who is willing to share a bit of their time and knowledge with me. Generally speaking, if admitting that I'm wrong is the next step towards my betterment, than It'd be a foolish decision to cut my nose off to spite my face by just not eating some humble pie.

>Beyond all that, consumption has inumerable benefits. People eat, drink, sleep, shower, bathe all as a result of the consumptory benefits of capitalism providing them the capacity to do so.

No argument here.

>Regarding, reducing customers to a means to an end, I would boldy claim that this is complete bullshit. If McDonalds really wanted to they could fire all service staff stop painting their buildings in their iconic colours cease all advertising, stop all the charity missions, destroy the playgrounds and basically become the corporate shell you already think they are, and they would probably still turn a profit. 

It'd certainly be an interesting social experiment to get a deck chair and some pop corn and soda pop to watch it with. My suspicion would be that once people realised that the comforts of their famed McDonald's store, were only there to keep them coming back as opposed to doing it because they were cared about, my suspicion is that they'd start to wake up and realise that they've in fact been lied to... that this wasn't actually being done for them because people wanted to help you, they did it for themselves at the cost of your qualtiy of life (health)... whilst pretending to care about you in their advertisements...  that this ""restaurant"" has been selling barely nutritional food (not referring to healthy options in more recent years), because they're too busy with their quest to make the cheapest version of something that will yield the most profit,  advertising campaigns, quest for global monopoly on fast food etc. Instead of maybe just making better quality food and let people's word of mouth do their job... 

This concept of getting good quality food to customers fast, worked for the two brothers that started the concept... just to add, they weren't sociopathic in nature. They achieved their goal whilst not fucking over the people they were doing it for. You're right again, I was referring to greedy CEO's of multimillion dollar (and billion dollar) enterprises.

I hope that my reply isn't a mess to decipher. So in short, you're right, capitalism isn't necessarily the enemy; It's just the best vehicle for the job of controlling the masses imo. To a degree, it's also our conditioned desire for consumption of things we don't need that is the problem.

>The Morrison Government's pledges so far amount to about $7,600 per person.


The Global Financial Crisis resulted in a $900 stimulus payment back in 2009 to me. Not sure how many months this period was deemed to be the length of the GFC.


So far, this crisis has lasted about a month with a stimulus payment of $750. The thing that's frightening though, is that there'll be another $750 in july or whenever it is totalling $1500. This isn't taking into consideration the Corona supplement of $500 extra a fortnight for who knows how long for, but the estimate is up to 6 months. If this is so, it'll equal $6,500. So $8,000.00 extra, to each person who was already unemployed at the time that Covid-19 became a thing.


Let's say 710,000 were unemployed Aus wide before Covid-19 became a thing (hard to find accurate stats as covid-19 results are dwarfing search results at this time)


*This equals 5.68 billion for Australia's already unemployed alone.*  Fark. Now add another 8 billion for the nearly 100,000,000 or so unemployed. In 2014, about 12.6 billion covered unemployment payments for 12 months. so basically for all on the job seeker payment (newly unemployed as well), the total amount for us all for the next 6 months, will be $12.6 billion, but probably a bit more due to population growth since 2014. Remember this figure for when covid-19 passes and the media propaganda machine gets going again with the ""welfare blowout this period cost the country blah blah blah"" rhetoric. we all know the vast majority of the debt won't be what has been paid to the newely/already unemployed but to businesses and towards business loans being my prediction. I digress.


I can't speak for anyone else but for myself, I can't say thank you enough to the current taxpayers of Australia (as well as the newely unemployed). It was/is your early starts, late finishes and generally speaking hard work that's enabled for this bailout to even happen. Even if the money was borrowed it was borrowed using our country's credit rating, made possible by you guessed it, you all.


I'm truly grateful so therefore I'll be spending as much of it on things in our community as I can (that haven't closed during this time). Things that I've gone without for for the past 4 years:


Things such as some new clothes, a new left-handed guitar to learn how to play so that I can keep my chaotic mind entertained during this isolation period, so I can sing and play and maybe who knows, start giging if and when things start returning to *normal*, a desktop computer as my 10 year old laptop is just about cactus, parts needed for my pushbike, bed linen and last but not leat, save whatever is left because times are frightening and I don't want to end up penniless in (hopefully only up to) 6 months when the Corona supplement ends and the 2 stimulus payments have been paid and social security returns to it's old rate (or slightly more as some groups have been fiercely advocating for, for months). All I can say is that to anyone of us who was unemployed before Covid-19 took off, especially those who live in public housing and which therefore have subsidised rent, making money last was a fine tuned tool. So at the end of this lets say next 6 months; you have no excuse to complain if social security payments revert back but you're still struggling due to having no savings.


Use this time/money AS WISELY AS POSSIBLE. You'll almost certainly never get such a financial boost again to help you get back on your feet. Not after the unemployment benefits revert back to their original amount.


And that's if we still have a social security safety net by then due to the total bill once corporate handouts and business loan offerings are taken into account. Yeah, my head is doing summersaults right now.


Such uncertain times, but especially if this virus really gets us by the throat.

Edit: wording."

Good question... seems absolutely bonkers to have done it.

To be honest, at this time I've intentionally tried to keep my Covid-19 news to a minimum, so even hearing of thiese facts is news to me.. It's worked out essential for my mental health maintainence at this time to do this just for the time being until the shock of such change to my life, starts to fade. Hopefully it will be within the next month or so. Till then, I'm just heading the most I'm portent stuff by snippets of news and my folks/friends.


Take care and stay safe."

I really think that Ghandi's approach is about the most effective/powerful (oxymoronic I know) tool that we have for such purposes.

Yes Government could start threatening violence or gaol, or both and even death to people behaving this way, but they can't treat the whole of society this way, or there'd be no economy anyway.

We do have far more power than our Government as a collective. Every country does. One could argue that even a country like China, her citizens have more power than their Government. If they all came together at the same time and just refused to work until changes were made... Then if things were still not at a place where an issue wasn't just, then a wash rinse and repeat until they are...

Edit: Some would probably have to die for the cause, but the end result would be inevitable (imo). Things would probably get worse before they got better, but the end destination is what's matters most.

Maybe a perfect world daydream but once again, what does any country at the cliff-edge of totalitarianism have to lose? They/we can't kill them all/all our own for disobedience.

An interesting topic for me. Maybe we'll find out sooner or later if Ghandi's method is our answer. One things for sure, violence and/or property damage isn't the answer. The people will never win with violence against a Government that has a national army."
