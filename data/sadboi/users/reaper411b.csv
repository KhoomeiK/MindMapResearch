insaneparents,fnq8tqu,t1_fnq40mt,1587159898.0,"Agree. Sounds much more like, ""See, this article says you shouldn't ever take away my XBOX! Wahn!"" And, if you read the article, the buried message is actually how when parents do that shit and then renege it sends a mixed message and ruins their credibility with the child, diminishing the effect of the punishment. Not that that shit's wholly ineffective to begin with."

insaneparents,fnq3muh,t1_fnpripm,1587157049.0,"Absolutely. Edit: Plus, what the article's basically talking about is when parents don't follow through with their threats and punishments, and then tries to use that to justify that those punishments don't work in the first place when it's actually that the parents are ruining their own credibility with their child.

Find an excuse to work harder, be better, get stronger, be more resilient, develop your fucking self and be a better person, instead of accepting reasons to /not/. Now, obviously, plenty of people (eg healthcare workers, delivery drivers, janitors, all kinds of low-income, overworked, mega-stressed people still out there and still working 60 hrs a week and shit) are struggling just to get by. But Jesus, plenty of people are just gonna piss this time away binge-watching fucking garbage-ass shows on Netflix or pretending to be someone important and powerful on their XBOX/Playstation. Do some fucking pushups, do some burpees, makeshift some dumbbells with milk jugs -- there's just about no end to what you can come up with for home workouts. If you live near woods/trails, go for a run/hike/ruck march -- you can stay self-isolated. Read some fucking books -- kindle prime/plus whatever is free for two months; get educated on politics, history, fucking astrophysics. There is freaking infinite educational content on YouTube. Duolingo is free -- finally go learn some Spanish like you always day you should, or German, or Swedish, or Swahili. Make USE of this time. Plenty of people are struggling, but plenty are gonna use this time as an excuse to be weak. Don't. Be better, be stronger, don't let yourself slack off. Find an excuse to overcome, rather than accept reasons to fail.

Edit: This fucking sucks for me too, and I'm not as productive and all this shit as usual either, and I'm no fucking superman, and all this blah blah blah. And I'm mildly autistic which they told me was bipolar when I was 11/13 and I've had metal health issues my whole life and all this shit, so I'm certainly not looking at it from the outside of all that shit. But I'm fighting every day to go hard, to improve, to defeat life's challenges. Fuck excuses, fuck weak-ass mentalities.

It's something you HAVE; it's not a disease, or a disability, or even really a disorder. It's just a label/diagnosis to explain your DIFFERENCE. Autism's only a ""disibility"" when you're taught that you have to play by neurotypical rules that might not make a lot of sense. Like putting a square peg it a round hole. Ain't gonna fit. It'll fit in a square hole though. And that fucking round peg may not fit in the square hole (don't overthink dimensions). Point is, autism's awesome -- in a lot of ways it's a fucking superpower.
