depression,fqukk9u,t3_gkzu1b,1589660407.0,I want you to do yourself a hard favor. Every day around noon or when the sun is high in the sky go for an hour walk. Yes anywhere even if it's from point x to point y and back home. Do that and really make an effort out of it. Its going to suck for the first few weeks but it will give you not only time to think of what may be bogging you down but also provide vitamin d intake which helps with the reduction in stress and in most cases reduces depression to a non existent to manageable state. Do this and if you like bring some happy up beat tunes to relax to... Or anything that just clicks and reflect on it. I thought my shrink was bullshitting me when she told me to just go out and do something and I know for a fact I didn't want to. I did this and it built me up and my conversations with her have been more up beat.
