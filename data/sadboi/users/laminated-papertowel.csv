The one thing you will want to make sure of is to have entertainment available all the time. If you'll be staying in your bedroom, move a TV in there with you, get some books. A portable charger is your friend. Keep some snacks on hand. 

One thing I wish I knew was that compression is annoying and uncomfortable as SHIT, but KEEP THAT COMPRESSION ON. I decided I didn't want to deal with it anymore and I ended up with a huge seroma in my chest that I had to get drained. I highly recommend you keep the compression on your chest for even a week after they say you don't need it anymore. It's annoying and uncomfortable, but it's with it. Good luck man."
