He and I both could do with a service dog due to our mental health issues, and while I‚Äôve felt the loss of pets I can‚Äôt even imagine what you‚Äôre going through right now. Obviously it‚Äôs early and your pup is still around, but - and I mean this in the best way possible - when you‚Äôre ready I think it would be a good idea to get another service dog. Like I said, I wouldn‚Äôt even fathom it in your situation currently. But down the road. Just because your dog has helped you so much, I would hate to see you suffer/decline because he/she‚Äôs not there. Lots of good dogs need homes and I know it won‚Äôt be the same, but I just wanted to make sure you were considering it when the time is right."

depression,fkh6e4x,t1_fkgxb8r,1584190167.0,"i disagree with this. at 16 you should be wanting to dive into all the things you love and hanging out with friends and loving life. OP has loss interest in EVERYTHING, is eating less, *wrote a suicide note,* knows depression from their mother, and is reaching out for help. it is definitely not something to be taken lightly and it‚Äôs not ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù would be going through just a funk. this does not sound like that. 

you could be right in that maybe OP could find new hobbies, as everyone does when they grow up. but they‚Äôre 16. literally every single hobby is available to them and they just want to sit home and listen to music and do nothing. it‚Äôs not something to just blow off by saying ‚Äúoh you‚Äôre young you‚Äôll get over it.‚Äù

i DO think, OP, that you‚Äôll get past this. i‚Äôm 25 and have been dealing with severe depression due to trauma since i was 16 as well. but the little things make it all worth it. if your parents are no help, i would reach out to some friends or maybe even THEIR parents and see if they can help. maybe look up mental health programs for youth. 

i love you, you‚Äôre worth everything."
