sikkim,flyu4sk,t1_flu9fmb,1585609148.0,I heard they have stopped all the travels within Sikkim also. I’m in contact with my family everyday and my partner and I have stocked up enough food but it’s kinda getting boring. We used to go out and eat every weekend but now we just eat home cooked meal (I’m a terrible cook 🤣). I hope this lock down will be over so that we can get back to normal life. I don’t even step outside of our flat. I went to balcony today after a week and that’s all. Hope you and your family are safe.
india,flu3bpn,t3_fqymfj,1585494269.0,"I’m from NE and I reside in Bangalore. My neighbors and the vendors that I normally buy form have been extremely accommodating, going as far as offering me to pay later if I’m in sort of cash. 

I’m just writing this to let my fellow NE people and people of Karnataka to know that there are good local people out there; by saying this I’m no way denying the kind of racism we face. 

What happened to those guys is really sad. Someone should have stood up for them. I would have cried if I were them. Hope they found a way to get groceries."

Once you tell her about them, you will need to be strong for mom. You keep checking up on her and be there for her. I know it’s a lot for a 15 year old but you be the one to lift her up. I know your sister will forgive you once she comes to her senses. 
Just keep us updated."

I’m currently seeing A Chiropractor and in 2 visit, I have seen lot of changes in my body. I hope your friend really did try everything. 

There is a back pain sub-Reddit here, you can read about people who went through surgery and regretted. I hope your friend will be cured."
HumansBeingBros,f5qssd1,t3_dorjks,1572382410.0,"Okay about the journal but Back surgery is what concerns me. I suffer from Disc Bulge and I have Lowe back pain 24/7 and my body is slightly bent. You friend shouldn’t go for the surgery unless it’s the absolute last option and when I say last option, that is if he is about to die. Sorry, English is not my first language but I know people who went for back surgery and is in pain meds for life. Hope your friend feels better."
sikkim,f5ca1x2,t3_dlexq6,1572132136.0,"Gangtok is east Sikkim and youbcan finish this place in a day. Form Bagdogra Airport book a WizzRide (hope I spelled it correctly), you will find their info online. Call them in advance and let them know of your arrival time and book a ride to Gangtok. Stay there for a day and go around places. (I’ll get you the list later) 

Instead of Namchi I would suggest Ravangla, place is cold, Buddha park is there and very few people resides there. You will need this after Gangtok because Gangtok is full of tourist. If you decide to go to Ravangla then you can go to local Taxi stand (next to HungryJack hotel in Gangtok) and get a ticket to Ravangla. If you decide to go to Pelling first then you will get the ticket in same place. 
 Pelling: Visit Pemayangtse monastery, Rabdentsey ruins and Sky Walk. You can finish these three in few hours, you can stay in Pelling that day if you want. Let me see if I can get you home stay details. My friend and her family runs it in a village. 
Next for village experience, go to Darap, it’s near Pelling and it’s beautiful. You can stay there for few days if you want. Ask your Pelling hotel guys for Homestay info and I’ll also check out with few people and see if they can give you authentic village experience somewhere. Don’t rely on me though but I’ll try. 

Visit Yuksum after Darap, it’s not that far and there also you can get the village experience. I’ll contact few people and let you know if there’s any useful info about the stay. 

About private taxi, you can hire one in Pelling and Gangtok to go places. They are quite expensive but if you have money then go all out and spend it. If you know how to ride a bike then you can rent it from Siliguri and google map will take you places. 

I’m sleepy but I’ll get back to you with information. I have iMessaged my Pelling friend already, let’s see. Goodnight."
sikkim,f54fvfc,t1_f54cky5,1571980792.0,"I read your questions below, so about Taxi, don’t hire private taxi to go places because it’s gonna cost you bomb. You just have to visit local Taxi stand and get a ticket to go wherever you want. Let me know the name of the places you wan to visit in West Sikkim and maybe I can write down instructions for you."
sikkim,f54fqdo,t1_f54cky5,1571980643.0,"If you have about 2 weeks then finish West Sikkim and then visit Darjeeling, Bhutan and Nepal, too. Other NE states are pretty far but Bhutan, Nepal and Darjeeling are nearby. And you won’t need Visa to visit Bhutan and Nepal. If you can’t make it to Nepal then you can at least visit Bhutan.
