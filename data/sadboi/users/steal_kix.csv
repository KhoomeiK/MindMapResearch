Your partner should be willing to work through misunderstandings with you. If he’s not willing to talk to you and explain and hear out your insecurities then that says a lot about the type of partner they’re being to you. But also, I think I just feel that if you can’t establish trust with each other then what’s the point; being constantly paranoid in a relationship is horrible. :/"

Vent,fkwy1ka,t1_fkwxr7j,1584610929.0,"I think the people your husband is around don’t help. But I also think completely disregarding the work many others put in to shed that image while people continue to label the entire industry as a whole is part of the problem.

It’s focusing on the negative while disregarding those who strive for progress. 

If you think the department your husband is in is putting him and you in danger then maybe it’s best to consider a different department? I know it’s easier said than done, but his job entails putting his life at risk, and that’s a big risk to take."
Vent,fkwwq6w,t3_fl55yh,1584609229.0,"The mindset of “Nothing like the typical people who work in law enforcement,” is part of the problem. There isn’t one type of person who all have decided to be in law enforcement. It does sound like the department he’s in isn’t the best, maybe that’s the problem. But judging all of the good working people that want to do good in the world, like your husband, isn’t fair. It’s judging just as you don’t want him to be judged.  

Shitty and shallow people are everywhere in every industry, it’s about finding a good work environment and people’s who’s views align with yours. Sometimes that’s harder to do but it can definitely help you feel a more secure when you know you can trust your coworkers, especially in that kind of job."

IWantToLearn,fjjkami,t3_fdlr88,1583400209.0,"I personally like to spread my tasks out because I get overwhelmed doing all of the cleaning on one day. I also get distracted. Usually I put some type of murder documentary on in the background as it helps me feel entertained.

I like to separate my big chores from small daily habits so that things don’t pile up. Dishes for me are a daily chore, but I do them in the morning because after dinner I’m usually tired. I do, however, pick up and put things away as well as clean the counters in the evening. 

I also have designated baskets in certain rooms to put items that don’t belong there, these k sort and put away when I do laundry on a different day.

For laundry day that’s all I do, with some general “picking up.” Any laundry on the floor or putting away the items from the baskets while I wait for loads. 

Then on another day I like to sweep and mop. Sometimes if I’m particularly lazy, I tell myself I’ll only do the kitchen as it’s smaller; but once I’m there I sweep the dining and living area anyway and get it all done with.

Also track your habits for 21 days. I read somewhere that’s how long it takes to establish a habit. 

There’s plenty of other chores but I find it easier to spread them out. If you’re struggling because it seems like more of a monumental task to do everything try having a daily chore instead. Once you feel better about one daily task you can add two and so on. Work up to it."
IWantToLearn,fjjjjga,t1_fjj83vu,1583399117.0,Habit tracking? This looks like what I use in my bullet journal for keeping track of different things. It is very motivating; I don’t like not filling in a square (in my case) because I’m lazy so I’ll get up as do whatever the task is.
