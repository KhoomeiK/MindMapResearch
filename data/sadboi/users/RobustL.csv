AskReddit,ey4uq3p,t3_cvedky,1566809119.0,"I've been depressed for more than 8 years but recently these last months things started to be very spicy. I developed bipolar disorder.
I normally have no friends IRL. Not because I don't like socializing, in fact I do socialize but I immediately regret doing so after getting attacked just for speaking and defending my own opinion, getting neglected and ghosted continuously even though I'm literally Infront of them talking and speaking with them and sharing their ideas, its like I don't exist.
So I thought of a solution just not to make myself miserable, and I started making what we call them ""internet friends"" and the results were good at the beginning, but after a short period they forget you exist, however this isn't the case with this person I've met last year. She was extremely kind and generous, and also more supportive than my ex. In a group chat I mentioned I was scratching my mouth constantly until I bleed since it's a habit I learnt, and it happens often when I'm really depressed. She noticed what I said and then asked if we both can discuss it in private, then while we were talking I was so impressed there was at least someone who really cared for my health.
We didn't stop talking right after that day, and if something went wrong she would help me with the maximum effort she's got.
Over time we became really close friends.
Recently these last months, she went through a lot of terrible events which I'm not going to write any detail about for privacy, but she got severely depressed that she was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Now I was trying to give her as much support as I could to prove to her that I still love her, that I still care about her, and that I have nobody in my life but her, unfortunately she couldn't talk very much after these incidents , she prefers to be lonely most of the time. So I try to invite her to play something since this is the minimum I can do, things go great. It's just the way we're talking isn't the same as before.
Another factor is the fact my ex disrespected my mental health and cheated, lied and offended me harshly. Too much stuff was happening that I developed dysthymia.
The only way I can stand in her side all the time is to book a flight to her country and to spend majority of time with her but it's insanely expensive...

But none of that stopped me from supporting her, or others. I never stop helping people who are struggling a lot with depression and the main way to help them is to reveal you truly care for them, by inviting them over, letting them vent to you, listening their feelings, showing them love, etc...

Sorry for the long text word, I really wanted to get these thoughts off my head as it really hurts that life is so cruel despite working hard for personal goals."

I mean... Let's say someone rushes you with normals, and then you lost 99 hp. You place doctor to recover 5 hp then it regenerates  over time until it's full again. The purpose of the game would be ruined...
Just posting my point of view.

Also it would be good if you post suggestions on the discord server... but I doubt it will be checked..."

depression,es1you9,t3_c5hsot,1561509305.0,"As others said , this isn't the end. Even if it looks like things will go very bad, it will eventually calm after.
But I advise you to move out as soon as you can... Your parents won't seem to be accepting you like this and they may also do harm on you which will make things.. worse...

Don't blame yourself on anything. Good luck mate..."
tifu,es1r4f7,t3_c5du4m,1561503603.0,"Not gonna lie, my brother and I tried this last month, while I was completely against his idea, he called ""911"" even though we do not live in America because he thought the emergency number only works in America and not any other country. After some few seconds, I hear an automatic generated sound which said ""You've been placed in the queue, please wait and we will make sure to respond as soon as we can"". To my surprise, it wasn't said in English but in our original language , so I grabbed the phone and immediately hung up.
The thing is... They never called back which is.. really odd. But I slapped my brother in his head for doing such thing, even though I was also dumb for letting him... Oh well..."

relationship_advice,erxpoc7,t3_c4nmy8,1561390635.0,"I am also depressed, and was in a relationship with someone for some years. When it is clear that they do not care and neglect me all the time, and also when I caught her ERPing with someone else, it was an absolute end. And I didn't fricking care that I separated from that SO. But what hurted me are the old memories we shared.

Anyway, I suggest you leave that guy now. It's not healthy and it's not a relationship anymore when someone is disrespecting their SO. Also, please get help by counseling, professional therapists, etc. 

Good luck."

depression,erwf3s7,t3_c4gpbu,1561341754.0,"Hello and welcome!
I also relate to most of the posts here... And it feels quite good knowing that you're not the only person suffering with depression and going through difficult days.
I also feel dead these months, inability to cry, to smile or even to do daily activities, and also extremely anxious.
I just graduated right now, while I was preparing for finals I had to deal with thoughts about my now ex GF leaving me due to her cheating on me. It was very hard to focus... but I tried to ignore and pass , and to put my mind with lessons to revise, I did my best to get good grades...

I wish you the best of the luck. 

r/depression will always be with you."
depression,erwemfz,t3_c4fs4f,1561341364.0,"I see what you feel...
Today was when I graduated from baccalaureate with a good mark, then my family including my mom, all my aunts and uncles with their children and also grandmothers, came to our house to celebrate and to congratulate me. They even gifted me a sum of money and they brought with them a cake with ""Congratulations RobustL! ❤️""
At first, I never expected this at all, I was like ""Why are you doing all of this to me? Are you sure you did it to the right person?"" It's the first time in my life I get a gift.
Wow... I was surely surprised , I felt dizzy during that but I accepted those unexpected happy feelings .. because life has its ups and downs. You never expect what will happen to you in the future. So.. you gotta be ready..."
depression,erwdzdr,t3_c4fynp,1561340820.0,"Same. But... I don't want a SO anymore because I'm certain they will end up by breaking up with me then destroying my heart again while it's already broken. Love hurts fricking too much that it can make someone suicide if they lose their love of their life.
Also , I understood I'm a living who isn't meant to be loved, I don't deserve relationships or love, even though I give people my love and my care to them a lot.
There may be some exceptions which appear as surprises, though."
depression,erwdc6t,t3_c4g98f,1561340286.0,"Same mate... Same...
I also use most of my time playing video games, I have 1 close friend but I think I lost them already since we lost our urges to talk ... It's too depressing I keep losing people I love.
Over time I get over it and live by myself. Nowadays, I'm totally alright with being single and soon, I will be totally isolating myself from everyone in the world."
depression,ers8is5,t1_ers5v95,1561205220.0,"Because it is a choice that is permanent and you can never correct it...

I'm also depressed and I have suicidal thoughts but I don't want to kill myself, instead I'm waiting for it itself to come. It's very dangerous to take a decision which is permanent ...
There's plenty of reasons too like.. things MIGHT get better after. If you get depressed all time then it doesn't mean you will stand in your position the whole time there where you got depressed, but you should move to another place where you can be happy.
I at least plan to do that.. I plan to live alone, without love or family, maybe I'd be adopting pets who would at least be with you in your heart, and I can imagine that it's a happy life away from every single individual who ever harmed my heart..."
