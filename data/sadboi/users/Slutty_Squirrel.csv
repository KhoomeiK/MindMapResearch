And we are talking turning blue asthma attack allergic reactions.

She just turned 13, and we now have two of the sweetest cats you’ve ever met. They both, literally, sleep on her chest at night.

The younger they are, the more likely they are to grow out of an allergy.

But I would definitely make the home dairy free.
Luckily, there are a lot of really yummy alternatives nowadays. I had my breakfast cereal this morning with almond milk… Just because.

Are you near a major city? I’m not sure what the medical care is like where you are… Or what your circumstances and insurance is like… But I personally was taking my child to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to the allergy department there. 

Talk to your primary of course, but I definitely think you’re a specialist level here. Hopefully, at a children’s hospital."
