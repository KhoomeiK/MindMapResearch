That’s the exact problem I am describing. 
They’re being misdirected and when someone like The Joker comes along and points them to the actual cause of the misery, it feels almost exciting, like the violence is justified. 
That’s why I don’t think a man of colour or a woman would ever have this response because of the different socialisation that white men experience.

I still think it requires a certain level of self importance (maybe importance is the wrong word...) to have the reaction that Arthur did. 
Thinking that the removal of your self worth makes it okay to murder people shows to me that he felt he was owed something by society. 
I don’t know what to call that ‘feeling owed by society’ thing is, but I’d argue that that is a typical white male response no matter which class. 

I’d say it’s a lot worse in upper class men, who feel they are owed a great deal more, but it’s still not the same message that women are sent about their self worth."
ShitLiberalsSay,ffwbc6f,t3_eve41q,1580293725.0,"I know I’m going to be downvoted into oblivion BUT please try to hear me out, I promise I’m open to other viewpoints. 
I saw this movie in cinemas twice. I am a white woman of..I dunno working class/middle class background I suppose? (I don’t own a house or car or anything of value, neither does my mother but my father does..it’s complicated. I’m not doing super badly but I probably could be doing better if I tried harder) 

Anyway! When I saw this movie I absolutely thought that it was important that he was white and male. 
Why? Because to me this is what White males do. 
How many women or men of colour do you know who are perpetrators of mass shootings and violence like this? (When I say violence like this, I hope it’s clear that I don’t think only white dudes are capable of violence. Just that there’s a specific brand of violence I associate with white men.) 
It was an incredibly ‘male’ movie to me. Which doesn’t undermine its importance, and I still think it was good?? But I get a bit sick of that point of view sometimes. I’ve seen it before. 

White male working class people have a very unique way of looking at the world. It’s like they are imbued with a sense of importance because of their whiteness and maleness BUT they are fucked over by the class system and that consumes them somehow. 

As a woman, I feel (not saying it’s necessarily reality but) like I am sent messages of unimportance from an early age. Being fucked over by the class system is not so much of a shock to me, because I’m already a little fucked over by patriarchy. It’s like I’m so exhausted from trying to leap over those hurdles as a woman, that anything else seems too much. 
And I just don’t think women are socialised to be violent over disagreements the way men are. 
Not that I’m trying to dismiss the struggle of working class people as a mere ‘disagreement’ but it all starts when we’re young doesn’t it?
