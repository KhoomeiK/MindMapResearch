They need validation for their own eyes. I bet they are so conflicted right now. It's super easy for me to say throw him out without the emotional aspect of it.

You know you need to work on better coping mechanism and self control,  it's always a choice to push someone or to yell or smash stuff. Try reading ""why does he do that "" https://www.docdroid.net/py03/why-does-he-do-that-pdf free~

You might notice your family has controlling tendencies , they might be manipulative or gaslight you. They might know your triggers,  taunt you , watch you flip out and denie they said those words and make you appear crazy, that's gaslighting friend. Even on different levels or smaller scales that shit sucks to realize. But you can work through it.  

You can ask your friends to disengage with you when you get super angry & not to engage with you. Let them know you know you have a problem & are working on it if you are close.

Try to figure out what triggers you, is it personal space, is it being cornered,  is it certain subjects? You should start learning about conflict resolution,  agreeing to disagree & engaging with people that have different outlooks than you outside of your family.


If you find that your family corners you in the room a: don't go into your room,leave the house even if it is the yard. B: grayrock/just say ok , whatever,  sure, idk in a calm tone. They will see you aren't reacting and leave. Do not touch them, tell them you will record them with your phone if they start to yell. Idk. 


Once you start to break away from dysfunction,  your family may not understand and hope you into it. Don't preach to them, waste of your time. 


It's ok to not date any time soon, you see you have a problem and you are working on it. One day at a time. Goodluck if you see this!"

If he found that subject matter sexy, he needs to outright say that instead of bringing it up in a weird way that causes op to go back to the rape. Instead of saying the fantasy of rape/control turns me on, he is saying what if I touched you like your rapist did, basically putting himself in the memory/situation of a real rape & not a control consenting act.


OP I think you need to have a heart to heart with him. You've been validated & know it's wack how he's been talking to you. Ask him if he has a rape kink/consensual scene he wants to work out. At that point if he says no, well he's just idk, don't want to insult him since you are with him. 

If he says yes,  well you can let him know that type of stuff is off the table. If he can't accept it, he will have to move on. Let him know when he brings it up each time, he is bring you back to those painful memories. You don't need to live like that."

Yes, him wanting unprotected sex and not getting tested is a huge red flag. Guys don't always show symptoms of STDs. It's normal to use protection even if the sex feels better without it. It sounds like he just wants to cum inside of you for his pleasure & nothing to do with your pleasure.

By leaving him you are helping him. By going to therapy you are helping yourself now. Try virtual counseling of office visits aren't possible. If you can't afford it there are other options.

relationship_advice,fpqfe21,t3_gebusx,1588821549.0, I think it's great he was honest when you asked him. Clearly that has to be traumatic for his parents which is why they probably don't speak often. Would he be opposed to you speaking to them over the phone. Has he ever shown any red flags before?

I'm not going to say he's cheating but I think it's cringy that he admitted he and his friends share sexual stuff? Like if he is ashamed to show you, does it mean he's commenting on it?? Like is graphic? Is it just different porn subs? Like I'm a little confused why a bunch of dudes are sharing porn together , are they circle jerking?


Sorry that was a little bit silly. Your last post didn't come off as crazy or controlling either. I guess get yourself an std test when possible,  lock your phone & do not share the code or let him use it. Same for your personal devices. Unless it's some kinky or cringy shit with his friends, he has extreme trust issues, I would be concerned about him having an affair."

I mean if she blocked you she's the one going NC, not you. By a bender does your girlfriend have a drug or alcohol problem? Has she asked for space before & you don't accept it? Like if she's never done anything like this before you seem totally accepting of just letting it end without a follow up, I assume there were other issues??"

relationship_advice,fpj9450,t1_fpg34es,1588660370.0,"Honestly I have Autistic friends and never have I once viewed them as mentally retarded. The OP did not call anyone mental retarded nor was the coworker viewed as an idiot by anyone but you. Please don't say ""we"" when you can only speak for yourself not the whole community. Have you googled intellectual disability? You get a mix bag of results that can end up showing ADHD as a result.


Like I tried to point out, terminology can be confusing & is changing. Some folks with Autism like to say they are ""high functioning"" on the spectrum while others with autism disagree with that viewpoint & terminology. A close friend of mine growing up was diagnosed with Aspergers which now isn't associated with Autism or they just removed the term? Diagnosis depending the doctor??? He is very smart academically when he cared and was very creative & affectionate but suffered with social ques and appropriate behavior , he had other things like food tics and ect

Another friend mine with it is female which apparently gets often underdiagnosed in women.


I am not autistic though I am not neurotypical. Probably would have saved hella money from doctor's appointments,  on going therapy & medication to deal with my mental health issues that interfere with my life :)


I would say the public image of autism is usually a super smart genius with poor social skills, like rain man, big bang theory,  ect or with obsessions. 

Yet those who have autism that have low IQs or are non verbal often get over looked or extreme sensory issues suffer greatly due to the pretentious stereotypes."
relationship_advice,fpijm6j,t3_gdhee6,1588642269.0,"So OP, it sounds like you have been drinking to cope with a lot of extra stress lately,  loosing your job & COVID-19 & now she finally takes away sex/intercourse which feels like the final stress blow.


Is it just intercourse that she is now rejecting or all foreplay and sexual acts together? Do you think should could of had a pregnancy scare? Do you think she wants to be married but said it half joking which ended up turning serious?  Is it more about the fact she wants a kid and be married before that happens? Could you get married and hold off on having a kid till you feel more stable? 


I think it's a real shame to throw away your relationship & just bail instead of getting into the heart of it. Perhaps see a couple's counselor & sober up before engaging with her. It's ok if you need to take space or to sleep on the couch for a little while."
relationship_advice,fpid2fp,t1_fpi6v9a,1588638420.0,"Hey OP I read through your comments and need more clarification. Did something happen to your boyfriend (molested/raped) for him to not be engaging in sex with you? Is he asexual and you didn't realize that till way after? (Asexual,  you crave romance & affection but lack the desire for sex to sum it up shortly) Is he afraid of pregnancy? Could he be gay & is not in an area where that is acceptable or considered a crime? 


I am extremely sorry he flipped out. I hate my monthly period and find it gross occasionally  myself but my boyfriend does not. I think I just don't like blood.   

Did he change throughout the relationship or perhaps you did not mind as much in the beginning. Could he be a big germaphobe/blood fears/ does not understand menstruation? None of that excuses what he did to you.I understand you may not be in a good place to break up right now and that's why I am asking questions instead of insulting him."

You bought the fucking cat & didn't do all the basic shit.

The title is misleading as it implies that your father is complementing his daughter's breast/boobs which is extremely taboo & incest like compared to saying that you have breast that hide your odd shape chest bone which he can not hide.

Has she had emotion outburst before? Can she communicate that certain subjects are a trigger for her?

Like from your experience you could offer how she might navi6this situation,  hotlines,  advocacy groups but instead explaining how smart you were was just pointless. 


Terminology is confusing & often changing.  She did not use mentally disabled as an insult to her intelligence or remark she was stupid. Bringing up your IQ & test scores feels like a dick swing competition & irrelevant. Smh"

Honestly the ""what if"" conversation should of came up way before a scare & was extremely inappropriate of her to lead you on. I think you need to let her know it was not ok to have that talk to see your reaction when she already knew. 


Is there any chance she didn't get her period and is planning on an abortion? Like does this seem out of character for you? Would she be willing to take a pregnancy test? Honestly once your anger fades, you'll realize your trust has been broken with her."

relationship_advice,fpbwtq6,t3_gcdg2w,1588480812.0,"The issue isn't because he's smoking marijuana which is ridiculous that it's still illegal. 1.The main issue is he's doing something that's illegal in y'alls state that could hurt both of yall financially & involve CPS. 2 It sounds like he's smoking in the room with the baby , aka second hand smoke which isn't ok. There are edibles & tinctures & vapes available even in states that have marijuana illegal. There's no excuse for that. 3. He's spending a good chunk of change weekly on it, which sucks cause it's probably more expensive in your state compared to the legalize states. I imagine if he was spending that much on beer you would be upset.


Why does he smoke so much? Is it for anxiety/depression? CBD is legalized in all 50 states when it's under .3 thc. That's the stuff that actually helps in weed, not the thc that gets folks buzzed.  Is it just a recreational thing for him? Like what's going on? 


Would it bother you if it was legal in your state or does he just get stupid high?"
