Probably the weirdest part was that a girl threw an empty water bottle on stage and he thought it was aimed at her so he immediately started chewing her out for being ""dog faced"" and a ""pony soldier"" (wtf???) and she got so upset she left. I think he felt bad once she was leaving because he immediately changed the subject to his favorite kind of candy (gumballs) and talked about it at length for a couple minutes. Later in the show he was performing Broke as Fuck and during the bridge he was like ""YO! Anyone got any gumballs in this house?"" super weird.

The range the guy shows is unmatched tbh - his first album sounds like listening to early Justin Timberlake performing at Coachella but it’s in hell and everyone is on mushrooms and part of the illuminati (I mean this in a good way), and his second album feels like synth pop from the 1980s made love with production from the 2080s and had baby in the form of an ultra chrome off the wall breakup album

Definitely check out his solo stuff - there honestly isn’t anything like it. I feel like that’s a blessing and a curse because nobody can really do what he does, but at the same time he gets passed over because he’s very singular and there’s nobody he really fits in with (well, other than Rina!)"

That way it’s more of a personal choice for the employees and the company itself would still be able to sell things.

>You made a claim that leftist progressives didn't hurt Hillary in 2016, and now you've walked that back to maybe they did hurt Hillary, but only because she deserved it for not listening to them.

Id like to see where I said that, especially considering you’re replying to a post wherein I specifically give Hillary credit for listening to the Sanders base and moving left. 

News flash: Sanders supporters are not the only ones who did not go out and vote, nor are they the only ones who were galvanized to vote against someone who is considered a liberal boogeyman in the conservative sphere in an election with a historical level of unpopularity for either candidate. Sanders supporters were not the only ones unenthused. 


>While Hillary's policies and experience were very good, you are right that she had a lot of baggage. At the same time, why would Hillary move further left and risk losing centrist voters who turn out to get the support of leftist voters who don't.

I don’t think going any farther left would’ve helped her. I was perfectly comfortable with her platform by time November came, but I think it the reason people weren’t enthusiastic about her was her baggage and how inauthentic she seemed. I’m sure there are many more that take more priority from other voters, but that’s what I seemed to gather from those around me at the time."

Honestly I agree with your entire post except this:

> You shouldn't need a personal goddamn state visit like it's the fucking Queen of England to do something as simple as check a mark on a sheet of paper.

This is so far off base and probably one of the worst takes I’ve seen on this subject. Grrr! How dare those voters want a politician to *earn* their vote! The unmitigated gall they must have to not be enthusiastic about a politician who is not only straight up skipping their state while the other guy comes through multiple times, but one who has minimal ground game there!

However, a 10% discrepancy does not invalidate the rest of my post. I don’t think it’s wild to say that if you’re trying to get a certain subset of voters to come your way that you need to earn their votes. Hillary earned mine by moving more left to capitulate to Sanders’ platform, but I am not every voter and would not fault anyone for not being enthusiastic about a candidate who never even visited their state."

Blaming progressives for conservatives winning when more Sanders supporters went out to vote for Hillary than Hillary supporters went out to vote for Obama in 2020 is so stale and removes any agency from a bad candidate. I voted for Hillary, donated and went door to door for her when she won the nomination but it’s obvious she had tons of baggage and ammunition to use against her, and she didn’t even visit every state for fucks sake - she never even stepped foot in mine, and guess who won it? Trump, who had done multiple rallies here in a traditionally purple state.

The DNC keeps punching left, shitting on progressives constantly, then gets pissed when people are disillusioned and aren’t voting for their candidate because those voters feel like their vote hasn’t been earned. Come on man, that’s a bunch of malarkey!"

I posted a little [vhs demo ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/fs07kf/vhs_dreamin/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) people seemed to like a couple days ago, so now I’m back with a pt 2!! Super glad people liked it, I love doing these kinds ~aesthetic~ videos

If anyone’s interested my IG is @b_schmi, I’m going to be posting a lot of stuff like this from now on!"

I’m sending you a lot of love today OP. I wish there were answers for this kind of thing. God knows the world would be a better place if our pets could stay with us forever."
hiphopheads,flv3azc,t1_flv03i9,1585515483.0,"Definitely not true dude. It's all the hand you were dealt. Finneas grew up in completely different conditions; just because he's younger and has been doing it longer doesn't mean his ceiling of potential is higher than yours at all. Personally, I'm a HUGE fan of artists who don't blossom until they're a little older than what's considered ""young"" - Death Grips, SOPHIE, Clarence Clarity are for my money some of the most forward thinking musicians in the last decade and they're all 30-40 and didn't start making that type of innovative music until they were in their 30s.

If you're gonna give up because someone younger than you is succeeding, you're always going to lose because there will always be someone younger than you."
jaipaul,fltaewj,t3_fr1k5r,1585464780.0,"Definitely check out everyone else from Paul Institute like his brother AK 

Clarence Clarity feels like a logical extension of Jai Paul to me in that he makes very catchy soulful bangers over totally bonkers maximalist production, both his albums are worth checking out. Think:peace has that 80s slickness of the leak while No Now has front to back bangers"

AskLosAngeles,flej8h2,t3_foc35v,1585085439.0,"78% of Americans live paycheck to paycheck according to Forbes. Either the people at the top are so woefully out of touch they aren’t aware that having to pay rent while not having anything coming in will put most Americans in hot water, or they flat out don’t care.

My heart breaks for all the people who will go into debt, become homeless, or straight up die because our politicians have put corporate interests above the wellbeing of their constituents. I’m desperately hoping that this is the thing that wakes Americans up."
AskLosAngeles,flcqbks,t3_fo1m4p,1585041838.0,"Rumor has it that there’s a lot of mescaline on the streets lately, mostly because there’s a new supplier around I guess who has some kind of formal training in chemistry. From what I’ve heard it’s more pure than ever, and it’s supposedly a different color than usual too. 

Can’t say I’m too surprised, apparently the new supplier has a physically disabled son and a kid on the way (or so I’ve heard from an insider source) to provide for. Crazy stuff."
LosAngeles,fl9bao6,t3_fndre9,1584948012.0,"I went out to a trail that I really like and there were TONS of people there. Usually there’s maybe 10 people in the parking lot but it was packed and overflowed out a few blocks. I was totally shocked. 

I ended up leaving because I knew there was no way to social distance when you’re on a cramped trail that is only 2 or 3 feet wide and there’s no room to pass. Plus too many common areas to grab for leverage that could become a point of contact. No way you’re getting through that."

hiphopheads,fky48ls,t3_fl9ibk,1584641098.0,"This is easily one of the best albums of the decade, imo. This felt like a victory lap for the whole Death Grips project and everything after was just a cherry on top. The guitar work on this just goes to show how Death Grips aren't just ahead of the curve, usually they ARE the curve"

hiphopheads,fk1u0lk,t1_fk1rijl,1583786838.0,"Colorful aesthetics, cartoony guerilla style music videos, lo fi recording, etc. Its a wide cast net and I don’t have the time to break it down but I’m sure you can find plenty of articles looking back at how novel artists racking up millions of SoundCloud playa before even doing their first tour was at the time. It’s less of a genre and more of a moment in time"
hiphopheads,fk1re9i,t1_fk1q5r1,1583785344.0,"SoundCloud rap is less of a genre and more of an era at this point, tekashi never even had a SoundCloud but aesthetically he fit in very well with his contemporaries"
hiphopheads,fk1pgag,t3_fg02nz,1583784304.0,"What do you think the next hip hop ""era"" will be? I feel like the soundcloud era is on its last legs because most of the big artists associated with it are either dead (x, lil peep) in jail (tekashi, kodak) or have fell off (pump). 

Some artists like uzi still seem to be doing good, but I feel like the novelty and by extension the trend has died down and people walking around with rainbow dreads and face tats are so late to the party they might as well be wearing shutter shades"
indieheads,fjzuxad,t1_fjztbgs,1583730214.0,"Yeah, it's hard to comprehend how young 24 really is and how remarkable this album really is - I knew 24 was young when I was like 17 listening to the album, but now at 24 myself it's really mindblowing.

What do you think of Patrick's output post-The Monitor? I liked Local Business and was really into TMLT for a while but I haven't really connected with anything after that tbh. To me it feels like it lacks the teeth of everything (minus LB arguably) up and including TMLT had, and even on their more punk songs it kinda feels like a compromise in terms of energy and overall Pat's lyricism hasn't really wowed me like their first two albums. Idk, maybe I just need to put more effort getting into their more recent output since it took a couple listens for The Monitor to click in the first place"
indieheads,fjzs48h,t3_ffozx7,1583727668.0,"Man, crazy how long it's been. IMO this album is near perfect and has the edge and ambition that proves rock music can still be pertinent and vital, and I wish more indie rock in the 2010s was as bold and adventurous as this was."
