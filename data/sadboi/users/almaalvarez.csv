BPD,f8pl2v2,t1_f8p1e19,1574703241.0,"I feel this way a lot of the times, a part of me wants to believe it’s my medications that have made me feel this way. But another part of me thinks i really have lost the person I once was. I think that’s what scares me the most"
womensstreetwear,f7q1pa9,t3_dx6wcr,1573957555.0,So fire. I love this
bipolar,f7q1iax,t3_dx6mer,1573957475.0,stop oh my god....I remember when two therapists told my mom they didn’t want to treat me because i was manipulative or that they didn’t know how they could help me. 😭😭😭 literally I cant believe this happens to us.
BPD,f7q117g,t1_f7ott70,1573957286.0,"Lol yea...when you just finish having an episode and you’re just sitting in your bed with your face swelled up, numb as hell  and your room looks distorted. 😍😍😍"
BPD,f7q0jrq,t3_dx9e0h,1573957095.0,Yess! My doc said this can also be the medication  when I explained I felt numb in one of our sessions and felt like i wasn’t fully here. But it has so much to do with dissociation as well. What helps me a lot when this happens is mindfulness exercises (3 minute guided meditation/ being aware of my surroundings/ body-scan/ etc)
bipolar,f7pzgih,t3_dwreql,1573956656.0,I honestly dont even know how much effexor im taking because im not allowed to have access to my medication but all I know is that when i skip a dosage I throw up the next day. Effexor is literally terrible but it keeps me sane so guess I’ll just deal with the terrible side effects 😌
bipolar,f7lgkee,t1_f7l1w1r,1573839991.0,Why was this me three months ago.
bipolar,f7lgirb,t1_f7lcgwg,1573839964.0,"Im laughing, im on effexor too. We literally all live the same life"
bipolar,f7732xx,t1_f76ohp7,1573442615.0,I feel the same way! I don’t have a negative view towards others having mental illnesses but I think it makes me feel weaker to have this. My family sees me as a diagnosis rather than their daughter and I think it’s hard for me to accept that i actually have to cope with these ups and downs for the rest of my life because of the stigma around being bipolar. I don’t know I feel like I have gotten so far but I still feel almost ashamed and embarrassed for something i can’t change about myself
