mentalhealth,fq1k1ba,t3_ggg4pq,1589046347.0,I haven’t heard of this before. Maybe it’s some kind of ocd thing?
mentalhealth,fq1joiw,t3_gge4m5,1589046254.0,I know how you feel I’m the same. Although I’ve always been slightly introverted but much more so now. Do you take med or go to therapy? If not I suggest looking into it Also vitamin d deficiency can make this kind of thing worse so maybe think about taking a couple vitamin d pills every morning.
mentalhealth,fq1ir5l,t3_ggetou,1589046013.0,"Hey hey!!!! It’s ok!!!!!
They won’t give up on you!!!!! It’s doesn’t matter how slow your progress is. Progressing is never linear. You can take 5 steps forward 2 back 4 forward 3 back 1 forward etc etc. but you will eventually get there. If a therapist gives up on you then they are not a good therapist. If a therapist recommend you to go see someone else it doesn’t mean they are giving up on you. It just means they think that a different therapist will be better at helping with your particular situation. 
It’s always possible you may not click with you first therapist. Sometimes their method or way of talking or their personality just aren’t compatible with you and that ok. You just need to find one that works best for you. 
I can understand you anxiety. I was nervous too. But trust me it is worth it. It really does help. If you don’t get the help you need it will be much more difficult to get better and may possible get worse. 
There’s an app called 7 cups that i use sometimes. You can find therapist on the app. I don’t know the cost tho. You can also talk to volunteers that are there to just listen when you need someone to vent too. They do not give advice or therapy as they are not qualified to do so they just listen. Or chat if you just need some company. It’s completely free to talk to listeners. Maybe it’s something you will like. Maybe talking to a listener first can help you ease your way into talking to an actual therapist. 
I hope this helps! I believe in you!!! It gets better I promise!!!"
mentalhealth,fq1euli,t3_ggee88,1589045022.0,"I was never really suicidal but I was very depressed. Something she should definitely do is try and get as much fresh air and vitamin d as she  can especially with the whole quarantine thing. If she can’t get outside she could take vitimin d pills or get a sun lamp. 

What helped me is finding things to do. Watch tv series find a new hobby just anything really. Make new friends online. Playing videogames with friends is a great way to connect and have fun. 

She also need to make sure that she doesn’t let it take over. I let my issues completely consume me and didn’t try hard enough to get better. Idk if she’s doing the same thing or not but just Incase here’s some things she need to keep an eye on. 

Make sure you never let anxiety and depression take over. Cuz you can always control it to some extent. Don’t bottle you emotions but don’t focus entirely on them. When you start thinking bad thought just be like nope nope not gonna focus on that. Just yeet em directly out the window and focus on anything else as best you can. It’s ok to feel emotions. Just don’t let them take complete control. 
She also really needs to stop saying those things. I know she may believe them but saying them out loud or to yourself can cement them deeper into you mind. If she can’t stop insulting her self just rephrasing the insults into sarcasm helps a little. Like instead of saying “oh I’m so stupid” she could say Something like “wow Im such a fricken genius” something else that helps is forcing yourself to smile. Just smiling every once in a while can make things better. It can trick your brain To be like “oh that is the happy face! Therefore I am happy! Therefore I must produce the serotonin!!!!” 

Something that helps is saying positive things. Like I’m ok Im gonna get through everything is ok this I’m amazing i am strong I deserve to be happy etc. even if you don’t believe them just saying these things helps. Have her list good things about her day. No matter how small. It can be small things like this brownie I’m eating is tasty or I saw a pretty flower or I found a cute picture of a puppy on the internet’s too. 

These things are up to her to try and be as positive as she can be. The main thing you can do is just be there for her. Show her love and support. Remind her how much you love her. Give her compliments. Make sure she knows your always there to listen to her. If she insults her self shut that down real quick. Counter it with a compliment. Send her things. Like cute picture of animals you find or cute love memes r/love memes is a great source of those. Send her lots of stuff you think would make her laugh.aughter is always really good for things like this. 

Sorry if this is mess and hard to read I’ve got some bad adhd so writing is hard haha. I really hope this help and that she gets better!"
mentalhealth,fq18ose,t3_ggi3il,1589043276.0,Idk if it’s the same thing you mean but like sometimes I get a phrase stuck in my head and I’ll just keep saying it randomly like I’ll just say “chichen nuggest” every two minutes I think is some some of stim thing.

AmItheAsshole,fptpplv,t3_gfgwei,1588895789.0,Some people are saying this is fake and maybe it is but I have met people exactly like this. Went to catholic school and it was not fun. YTA 100000%. High standards like this are absolutely absurd. It puts so much stress on kids and sets them up for overworking themselves and never feeling like their good enough through out the rest of their life. Your grades do not truly matter if your trying to do good. Having low grades does not necessarily mean they are not intelligent or they are not trying. School system sucks anyways it’s not very efficient at teaching kids. My grades are often low but I try my hardest. I just have some short term memory issues and other mental disorders that make things really hard. You can’t cut someone off from the outside world that’s not ok. It’s definitely abusive. Especially during these stressful times. Why the hell is her having perfect grades so much more important to you than her mental health?
AmItheAsshole,fptjtbo,t3_gfgqyc,1588892576.0,NTA she just doesn’t like being wrong so she refuses to accept that she is. The way she’s acting is super immature and kinda abusive.
AmItheAsshole,fptij2i,t3_gfgvhl,1588891889.0,Some of this is kinda confusing but from what I understand Im gonna go with a soft YTA what you did was definitely a dick move. What your friend did wasn’t great either but it’s possible they didn’t think it’d effect you so much. People make dumb mistakes without meaning to hurt anyone. Did you talk to your friend before you lashed out? You gotta learn more about the situation before you do something. Did you even give them a chance to apologize? releasing private info about someone else is not cool no matter what. I’d say it’s worse than what your friend did. I do totally understand why you be upset. It’s perfectly ok to be upset but you gotta talk things out man.

Think about what you have to today. once you finished with that you can move on to the next thing you need to do. One step at a time. I hope this helps :)

And I know my terrible sleep schedule is not helping with my energy levels but I’ve always be super tired all the time which is part of why my schedule is all messed up. Even when I get way too much sleep and can’t get to sleep at night because of it I’m still exhausted. I tried melatonin it doesn’t really help much. Idk if I can’t not look at my phone for that long before bed. Cuz of my adhd I need constant mental simulation. Being bored is pure agonizing hell. I used to read a lot but now my mental comprehension is terrible so it’s hard but I could give it a try. I have talked to my doctor a bit the first step is to actually figure out whatever disorder I have. It’s kinda hard to do that rn with the quarantine. Pretty sure its a genetic connective tissue disorder of some kind. Idk what to do :(
AmItheAsshole,fp0w2gl,t1_fp0up7z,1588218224.0,Yeah that doesn’t sound fun. I really hope things get better for you.
AmItheAsshole,fp0u22w,t1_fp0sf58,1588216921.0,Ah i see sorry. I have very bad reading comprehension. I read it like 3 times to make sure i didn’t miss anything and still did so I apologize. That makes more sense. I do think you may be escalating it too much still but it’s much more understandable now. You need to be willing compromise and if he doesn’t wanna compromise then he’s at fault. Id suggest talking to him again. Don’t raise your voice and just tell him it really genuinely bother you and that it hurts that he ignores you. I hope you guys figure things out :)
AmItheAsshole,fp0s4mo,t3_gan2j9,1588215702.0,ESH you have no say in what he plays. It’s understandable that it might bring up bad memories or feelings but instead of forcing him to completely stop doing something he enjoys you could compromise. Just ask him if he can only play it when you aren’t around. Also yeah he seems a like an asshole for ignoring you and telling you to fuck off. That’s very not ok. Your both escalating the situation more than you need to. Keep in mind quarantines got everyone extra stressed you both might just be a lil extra cranky. Being inside all day with the same people can be exhausting no matter how much you love them. Make sure that you both have enough time to yourselves. Also maybe find an activity you can both do together? Maybe another videogame that you can both play? I know they probably aren’t your kind of thing but there’s all sorts of games so there’s definitely something out there you’d like that you could both enjoy together. Talk to him. No raising voices no arguing no anger. Just talk.
AmItheAsshole,fp0qvl7,t3_gan4r8,1588214927.0,YTA it’s just a song is it really that big of a deal? It’s not like it’s playing all the time and it’s not your phone. If there’s a very specific reason you don’t like it like if it brings up really bad memories or something then it’s understandable. Otherwise your just super childish.
AmItheAsshole,fp0puo4,t3_gan8rx,1588214298.0, YTA this is abuse. Not only is it a stupid reason to not let him have a new one you didn’t even tell him he couldn’t have a new one in the first place. Even if it was understandable hey the hell did you break it? Was that really necessary? Wtf???
