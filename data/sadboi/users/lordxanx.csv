juul,f7pfaua,t1_f7pd7k2,1573948538.0,"So doctors here often prescribe antidepressants for off label symptoms because they get more money from big pharma because antidepressants are more expensive then, for example, a xanax prescription.

But sniffing any powder into your nose will irritate it. Here‚Äôs what I do:

Use a pure saline spray before and after each line. When your done for the night rinse your nose/sinuses with a neti pot or get a saline spray the when used horizontally could also be used as a neti pot as it does the same thing.

After your done flushing your nose use vitamin E oil, dip a q tip in it and rub the q tip with the vitamin E around the inside of your nostrils and a reach a little further and put a little in your sinuses. Vitamin E oil is wonderful for healing an irritated nose."

cocaine,f7oohc2,t3_dx9cl9,1573930956.0,"No shit. The harder you sniff a line the further it goes into your sinuses which will just cause it to drip into your throat/stomach. 

You just want to lightly sniff to coat your mucus membranes inside your nostrils. The mucus membranes have something like a 99% bio availability. Just make sure your ket is almost a find powder or it will fuck your nose up. 

Whenever I see people rippling lines of ket, coke, etc I‚Äôm like wtf are you doing. Just basically waisting product because if you sniff to hard and it drips down to your stomach it‚Äôs only something like 30% bioavailability"

I‚Äôm sure since juul is the biggest brand and I imagine has billions of dollars that the government would just blame juul so juul did a bunch of damage control, that‚Äôs my theory. 

And exactly. An underage teen can get someone to buy a juul for them and get someone to buy some of the countless 3rd party pods that have flavors like cotton candy and shit. But mango and mint is somehow worse than that. I bought a pack of 3rd party pods twice. First was a 3rd party mango flavor. Absolute garbage, threw them out. Couple weeks later I was like I‚Äôll give a 3rd party brand with better reviews a chance. Got some strawberry eonsmokes, and they were complete garbage too!

I haven‚Äôt even heard of these new flavors, are they already in production? I‚Äôm going to look at electronic tobacconist‚Äôs site and see what all they have for sale. Glacier mint sounds good as well as nectar mango, maybe nectar mango will return mango to its glory days. I‚Äôve never tried cucumber even before it got banned. But I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs a either love It or hate it flavor. 

Give menthol a try too. You may enjoy it, I know a few people who exclusively use menthol pods. And yea the fruit flavor has and always will be absolute garbage.

And the US has banned all these flavors because the FDA decided that these flavors were designed to entice teens to start vaping, and another reason for the flavored pod bans is that a lot of underage high school kids were using juul, so the government decided to ban all flavors and only keep mint, menthol, and the tobacco flavors (fuck you high school kids for ruining the juul for people who actually used it for its intended purpose, to quit smoking cigarettes). Now the ceo of juul is sucking the governments dick and also decided to remove mint from the market.

I bought a 4 pack one time, vaped on the first pod for a bit, and instantly regretted my purchase. It also has this weird taste, like they tried to mimic a menthol cigarette but failed miserably. 1/10 for me. Only gave it 1 point because I‚Äôd have to be extremely drunk to actually smoke a menthol pod. I have to local verified juul stores but I‚Äôll look into sites like electronic tobacconist for purchasing pods. I used to only smoke mango but then they banned it and I switched to mint.

Edit: I was addicted to xans for like 2 years. I had a good plug that got 60 yellow school buses. I wrecked my car twice, the 2nd time I flipped it 3 times going too fast around an unfamiliar corner. I lost a job because of xans. I have anxiety and they help me so much with that. But I can‚Äôt remember 90% of those 2 years and I‚Äôll probably never get those memories back.
