bipolar,fl70gcc,t1_fl4gzji,1584890245.0,"It could be to some people but for me who struggles really badly with my mental illness I felt that it was empowering. My friend told me that her friend felt the same way, so I'm not alone with this.

Even though he becomes violent, it's cos he's the Joker, not because ""all mentally ill people are violent"" (quote from other people, not my words). I read it as it's ok to struggle. It's ok not to be like everybody else. The triggering suicidal things he says were exactly what I have said outloud. Even though he goes violent in the end and could have done better, it makes me happy that at least in the end, he allowed himself to be ""the real him"" and be happy for at least a moment. 

I related to a lot of different parts in the movie. A lot of things are difficult in life but seeing the same struggle you have on the screen, it gives you some piece of mind it's okay to be different."

Recently I was given ketipinor which seems to do worders. I have BPD and most of my intrusive thoughts are about my partner leaving me or me not being good enough. I used to panic even if I cut an inch of my hair, ""what if I'm not good anymore for him?"". With ketipinor I'm able to think and function normally. It starts to work quickly so I have smaller dose pills for episodes (so I just take a few and it allows me to think) and I take 100mg (I just started this medication, they go up to 400mg if you're schizophrenic e.g.) before I go to sleep."
