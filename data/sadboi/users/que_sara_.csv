Went for one drink by myself and came home and cried. We weren't friends after that lol. Since then it's been a bumpy ride and I basically have lost hope in making friends.

depression_help,epwzm5q,t3_bw7x6l,1559588521.0,"First off, I am so proud of you for getting help and reaching out. That is one of the most courageous things you can do. I am also 21, a female, but felt the heartbreak of this so much this year. Especially during the last few weeks of college when everyone was out partying with their friends and I didn't have anyone to even go get coffee with. It is a heavy, nauseating feeling. My therapist tells me that it is never too late to cultivate new friendships or give a little extra love to some old ones and see what they blossom into. The problem is not you OP and it never was. You are just navigating a situation in life that is new to you with no rulebook. Be gentle with yourself and give yourself the friend you have always wanted by starting off with talking to yourself with some kindness and compassion. No way in hell is this easy but hearing kind words from ourselves makes it that much more believable when we hear then from others too."
