coparenting,ff2cdmz,t3_er6bxw,1579500559.0,"To rid lice put mineral oil in the hair and scalp hair and cover it with a plastic bag over hair and tie over night it will kill you’ll have to comb out the eggs but that’s it. then no need to rewash just dry everything.  And spray big stuff with permethrin you can buy a spray mix on amazon. Also lice love clean hair that wash doesn’t work effectly some county’s have Lice clinics that help rid the lice 

That other person isn’t nice for not telling about the lice. It’s not a thing to get fired from nurse training for lice. They said it’s not a health concern just and annoyance. At least where I live 

In my experience using the mineral oil works everytime
Dying hair a different color will kill them in one try as well also straitening the hair 

Or you can just shave the boys"

We bought a few baby dolls and toys for her to learn how to be soft and gentle and loving with the baby if she is non verbal I would look into getting her a communication device we started my 6 year old when she was about 3 years old on the device and with PECs and she can communicate successfully with out speaking and still verbalize everything to the toddler even if she can’t answer back she is hearing you get a set routine and show her the baby stuff as you get it explain it’s for the little one in your tummy

Stair steppers are better for cardio then a treadmill it burns calories faster 

Have you tried the Keto diet? 

Have you tried CLA? That burns fat like melts it away it’s crazy 

I worked my way to one meal a day which is dinner I drink coffee thru out the day and if I’m super hungry a egg or high protein meat 

I only do preworkout and protein the days I go too the gym 

Now in June 19 I am 150 check out a good diet and try a stair stepper if you can’t stair stepper do the treadmill with the incline up I usually do the incline at a 10-13 for about 20-30 minutes. 

Try a HIIT work out

If you can’t do intermittent fasting
Try the eggs meat and cheese diet (you can eat ass much eggs meat and cheese as you want but that’s it) for 1 too 4 weeks you’ll lose a bunch then introduce veggies then slow in the sugars and healthy carbs"
