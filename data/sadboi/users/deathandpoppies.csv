Your post is so vague I went to your post history and honestly you need to seek help, threatening someone to get your ""dream wedding by force"" is not HVW behaviour. I truly hope you get help and work on yourself, and give us an update when things are looking better. Take care of yourself OP."

BPD,fa5ix8v,t3_e7qco2,1575815481.0,"It is an impulse many of us have/have had, however it's very unhealthy and will do no favours to your relationship.
As many have already suggested writing what you want to say on the notes app or even getting a small notebook for just those impulsive thoughts, and then once the episode has passed review it and with a calmed mind see what you think about it.
What does your bf say about you deleting texts like that?"

AmItheAsshole,ey5kmvk,t3_cvnaby,1566833981.0,"ESH. As much as I agree with the whole ""mental illness does not excuse you of being an asshole"", untreated PTSD can be a nightmare and will make you be desperate and irrational when you are continually being exposed to your triggers at the same time that you can't find a ""safe place"". Is there anyone at all in her life that she'd be willing to speak with about this? A friend, a family member, etc? Because someone needs to find out what caused her PTSD and why she's refusing the help your parents are offering. If she refuses to speak about it, take meds or attend to therapy then I think you should look into having her admitted into a hospital/mental institution until she's feeling better (she's a danger to herself and others right now) because you might not be qualified to deal with this and also you deserve to be okay. Also just to mention, she also seems to be at the end of her rope, if you kick her out chances are she might feel that her own mother gave up on her and just to tell you, suicide rate among people with PTSD is about 27%. I suffer from PTSD and BPD, if you need to talk or anything I'm here, good luck OP."

relationships,exed1ws,t3_csbyjh,1566210102.0,"I'm gonna have to go against the wind with this one because we don't have the 2 sides of the story and you didn't find anything in her phone that might show or suggest cheating. As much as boundaries are necessary, I don't think you might be respecting hers while asking for yours to be respected, it seems that if the relationship has to happen it has to be in your own terms, and a 5 year relationship with (what seems to be) a manipulative individual, isn't black and white, she was speaking about giving back stuff to each other and what went wrong, she isn't hiding to him that she is in a new relationship, and also if you don't mind me asking, what did she reply to him demanding to break up with you? Because that is important. If I try to look at the situation on her POV with the info we have, it seems that she isn't enjoying this either, an ex that won't make things easy and a new bf that is giving her an ultimatum over something he feels insecure about even tho he has already read the convo confirming there's no cheating. Ultimately the decision is yours OP and in no way I mean to judge you, different people, different opinions, but if I was you I'd speak with her once she has recovered, explain how you feel and ask for her fully honest point of view or what are the circumstances regarding this so there's a possibility of understanding. Whatever you decide, good luck OP."

This is so important OP! Plus there they can fill a report of your injuries advising that in fact you were anally raped, in case you decide to report him to the police which you can also do while you are there. Best of luck OP."
relationship_advice,ex40jyl,t3_cr9402,1565995416.0,"Listen to your son, get him counselling, whether it's true or not you will find out. Check the footage of said day like right away, worst case scenario you see something awful but save your kid from abuse and dodge a massive bullet, best case scenario there's nothing on the tapes (be 100% sure there's nothing sketchy) and you find out why your son is lying to you and stop the madness. As many have pointed out maybe your ex is instructing him to say that? Or projecting? Or maybe just jealous and he is desperate for attention? Honestly I don't know, when I started getting abused and raped at age 7 - 8 I never said anything, at least till I was 19, to later find out my mother knew and didn't do anything about it. Don't be that person, OP, get professionals involved and find out ASAP.
Also, whatever the outcome, be prepared for your relationship to end, sorry OP, this is a bad situation for everyone involved."
