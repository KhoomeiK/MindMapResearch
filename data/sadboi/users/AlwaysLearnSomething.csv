I just checked out and joined your parasomnia sub.  I can't find a sleep disorder sub or anything siminlar to that...Are r/sleep r/Sleepparalysis r/Parasomnia the main sleep/no sleep subs?

I have looked into parasomnia & felt that it explained/related to a lot of my sleep issues; but when researching it, I have found that most ""episodes"" don't last as long as the ones I have experienced.  I have read that they are usually under 1 minute(ish); and the cases that do last for 10+ minutes are associated with night terrors that include movements, kicking, thrashing, punching, etc.

Try being open with your therapist about everything you are feeling/everything you said in your post.  Be *honest* about your thoughts of suicide & how often you think about it.  Tell him/her about your panic attacks, how they feel, and how often they interfere with your life. Tell her/him that your current medicine is *not* helping your depression/anxiety (and perhaps is adding to it).

You father was likely not there to mourn her or celebrate her life; he was there for his own agenda.  

You did what you had to do in order to not take any focus away from your mom's passing.  Your father had no reason to be there except for his own selfish reasons - If he wanted to honor her, he could have started with not having manipulated her during/after the divorce.  

Tell him to go see a therapist to resolve some issues of guilt that he might have; your mom's funeral is not the place & his presence benefits no one but himself.
