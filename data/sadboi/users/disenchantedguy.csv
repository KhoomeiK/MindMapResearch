But what if you can't afford to live like that, what if you have no disposable income for these '24/7 good times'?

Many people are forced into being NEET due to circumstances, it's not a fun way to live, it's great that you feel fulfilled doing nothing all day every day but making it out to be no stress, doing whatever you want having the time of your life is just creating a false perception of NEET life, exactly what OP was trying to stop people from doing."

Even then most people don't know what to say when you do open up.

Worst part is usually the people who do this are the first to say stuff like ""I didn't see the signs"" or ""I wish they'd have reached out""."
lostgeneration,ew8xbj0,t3_cncazl,1565216500.0,"I left school with a completely warped view on how employment worked, I grew up being told every boomer stereotype about working hard, moving up the ladder, walk in with a resume a smile and a strong handshake, etc. And boy oh boy did it come as a shock to the system when it came to reality. Weird personality tests, signing up to tons of different accounts, application after application without ever hearing back.

Why, when companies don't even spend the time to send an automated email out to all rejected applicants, should anyone waste an hour+ on individualised job applications? Such bs."

I will talk to my dad about it and see what he thinks, I don't think he knows about this side of her, as it was her that left when I was young and although they see each other from time to time she's always in perfect mom mode. 

I'm more interested in what my half siblings will have to say about her in a few years since the oldest has hit the age where stuff started to go south with me."
raisedbynarcissists,ew8urtp,t1_ew7f3o8,1565215482.0,"Hello, thank you for your reply.

You make a lot of good points about focusing on myself. Thinking about it, since I stopped talking to my mom I do find myself thinking about her a lot more than I used to, I think she's tried to get in touch with me more than before doesn't help. I even have nightmares involving her sometimes so she's definitely a big weight on my mind.

I can definitely see a connection with me voicing my opinions and getting punished for it now that you've mentioned it. That time she ditched me in an unfamiliar city was caused by me complaining about going to a museum she wanted to go to.

The reason I cut off communication was because I was tired of falling of deaf ears, so it's sad to know that I'll never be able to get through to her. At least I can just focus on moving on now I suppose...

I'm actually waiting on a therapy appointment next week, I've never had one before and I'm not really sure what to expect, do you have any suggestions on what to say? I don't have many sessions so I don't want to waste any time.

I do have a relationship with my Dad, just not as close as it should/could have been. I talk to him maybe once a week at the moment but we live away from each other and although he's supportive about my depression he doesn't really get it or know how to help, the same with my step-mom and brother."

Just have to go through life day by day and kill myself slowly with poor eating, drug and sleep habits instead. Best thing for me would just be going randomly in my sleep one day. Soon hopefully."
