askphilosophy,eyw5y4n,t1_eyw55sh,1567521725.0,"Well it would be hard to definitely prove either of those conclusions tbh, he might've, he might've not but I do think that he did oppose his sister until his death. He said anti-semitism should be ""utterly rejected with cold contempt by every sensible mind"" and when she went to live in an aryan colony he called her a ""llama gone among the anti-semites"". He also fell out with Wagner over his growing anti semitism"
askphilosophy,eyw4js6,t1_eyw3lx2,1567520715.0,"Well alot of the whole Nazi ideology was made on Nietzsche's philosophies or to be more accurate, based on what Nietzsche's sister, Therese Elisabeth Alexandra FÃ¶rster-Nietzsche misquoted and misrepresented his ideas to mean. She took is works and often used them wrongly to support her 'Aryan race is superior ' beliefs. This was something Nietzsche vehemently opposed, as can be seen in a letter he wrote, but there was little he could do about this once he lost his sanity."

The fact that nothing matters again doesn't stop you from feeling miserable because you feel miserable regardless. I don't have a switch I can throw that'll make me go from miserable to not miserable. I feel what I feel and I don't know how to to control it. And move on to what? What do I move on to?

And find something I enjoy doing I don't think I can do that really, I just feel I can't, I can't see anything for myself in the future or in general, I just see death really. And it doesn't work that way I think, all day I distract myself hard as I can with work or anything I can get my hands on but at the end of the day, the distractions stop working and reality sets in. I can't handle reality I just can't."
