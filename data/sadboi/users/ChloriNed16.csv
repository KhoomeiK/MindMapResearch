changemyview,fooljx9,t3_g8gfiq,1587941395.0,"I am technically part of Gen Z (I‚Äôm 17). I have really bad anxiety. Last year I got tested and learned I have one of the highest levels of anxiety my counselor has ever seen in someone my age. 
It almost went off the charts. I‚Äôve learned that I‚Äôve had anxiety my entire life. My separation anxiety disorder can be traced back to when I was an infant. I didn‚Äôt sleep through the night until I was 15 months old. My mom would have to stay in my room, sing me to sleep while pressing down on my back. When I was 7, my sister and I would have sleepovers and I was constantly worried I was going to wake up to just her skeleton next to me. I cried myself to sleep because of it. I was worried something was going to happen to my parents in the middle of the night, but especially to my little sister. I didn‚Äôt want to go off to 5th grade camp for 2 nights cuz it made me anxious, but I couldn‚Äôt identify that was the feeling. 

8th grade was the worst of it, and it was the only year I had Instagram. Problem was, social media was not the cause of it. I was getting bullied at school pretty harshly (tho some might say it was deserved because of my ignorance). I couldn‚Äôt walk down the halls without it feeling like it was spinning, I was afraid to make any movement for fear of being too loud and disrupting the class, I couldn‚Äôt do presentations without breaking down before, during, or after it. 

I am now 17 and the only social media I have is Twitter (which I‚Äôm only allowed to access via our home desktop computer), and Reddit (if you count that as social media). I still have really bad anxiety. I also have depression, inattentive ADHD, and I still struggle with self-harm. I am in counseling and I take medication. Without it, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to function. 

EDIT: There is also a difference between normal anxiety, and an anxiety disorder. Social media doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúcause‚Äù anxiety disorders imo. It can absolutely make it worse for people, especially for those who are insecure about their appearance (which I am not). It definitely didn‚Äôt cause my anxiety, nor did it cause any of my friends anxiety."

AskReddit,fnv0qzs,t3_g3yyu7,1587276547.0,"Mostly affected me in a positive way, but there are some negative ways it affected me as well. My parents are very loving. Going to church every Sunday was one of the best things they could have ever done for me. Almost all of my closest friends go to my church and I have people there who I‚Äôve developed amazing relationships with. When I was little, we were taught that following Jesus was not about a set of rules you had to follow, but a relationship. We were taught to be like Jesus to everyone around us (unconditional love, generosity, forgiveness, etc.).  Throughout my whole life, they have allowed me to explore my passions and have always said they will support me in whatever I choose to do with my life in regards to whether or not I attend college and where that would be, my career choice, etc. They have overall been very supportive of me. That is, except for the fact that I am bisexual. They consider lgbtq+ a sin. My first experience coming out was a little bit forced and because of the stress levels my parents were experiencing with their jobs, they overreacted and it ended up being pretty traumatic for me. I remember one day, I was told in a very calm, loving, way that if I wasn‚Äôt repentant about it, there was a chance I would go to hell. It confused me cuz I thought that my parents were so loving and supportive, how could they not support this? It was hurtful. I also struggle with mental health issues as well, and have been told a couple of times that I need to trust God more/pray about it more/read the Bible more and maybe a miracle would happen that would get me off medication. Which was infuriating because I have been doing that anyways. They do know I need the help, so they continue to pay for my therapy sessions, my psychiatric appointments, and my meds. I have completely deconstructed and reconstructed my faith to make it my own, and I am grateful that I was raised in a household where Christianity was practiced because it gave me the essential building blocks to make it my own."
AskReddit,fnuz34k,t3_g3xrji,1587275104.0,"I‚Äôve had 2 really bad teachers. My 7th grade math teacher, Mr.W, and my 8th grade science teacher, Mr.B. 

I had a medical thing where I had to pee like all the time. I went to a urologist and found out that my bladder fills up 2x faster than it normally should. I had a doctors note that said I was allowed to go to the bathroom whenever I needed to. Well, one day in Mr.W‚Äôs class, I got up in the middle of his lecture cuz I really had to pee. I signed out like I was supposed to, and started to leave. In front of the entire class he yelled ‚ÄúWHERE ARE YOU GOING?‚Äù which made me freak out. I said ‚Äúto the bathroom‚Äù and he said ‚Äúno you‚Äôre not! I‚Äôm not done with the lecture you need to come back and wait till I finish!‚Äù Thankfully, my parents were awesome and said if you need to go, just go and we‚Äôll deal with the teachers if they have a problem with it. So I told the teacher it was an emergency, and left the room so he yelled at me ‚Äúif it‚Äôs truly an emergency then go but I know it‚Äôs not!‚Äù. When I came back, he hovered over my desk, pointed at my paper and stared at me and said ‚Äúare you gonna sit and actually do your work now? Or just sit there like a lazy bum?‚Äù. 


My 8th grade science teacher, Mr.B, was just creepy. He was very overweight and drove a small, old, beat up, green car. On pajama day, he wore Simpson‚Äôs pants WAYYY too tight on him, and a grey shirt that didn‚Äôt cover his stomach all the way. He had weird growths all over his face and he smelled really bad too. He was extremely monotone in his talking as well. Mr.B did not know how to teach at all. He would try explaining it and then would expect us to know exactly what he was talking about when he finished. He made us all do a science fair project that was above our grade level and could actually be used as an experiment in the science field. Yes, those were the expectations on us as middle schoolers, and he had to check us off. I presented about 10 different ideas to him which he all said weren‚Äôt ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù enough. When I asked him for help or some ideas/clarifications on the requirements for what would be considered ‚Äúadvanced enough‚Äù, he said we just needed to figure it out. We then had to present our project (I was developing severe social/spotlight anxiety then), and he was asking questions about it way above my knowledge and made me look like an idiot in front of the class. I went back to my seat and watched as he graded my presentation while visibly chuckling about it. I cried into my jacket until class was over. He was straight up creepy too. He would hover behind us while we were working, especially to the girls in my class. The creepiest thing he did was when my friend (female) tried to shoot a paper ball into the recycling bin, and missed. We were laughing about it, and Mr.B chimed in with ‚Äúyeah. It‚Äôs kind of like when you miss when you‚Äôre standing up to take a piss,‚Äù and laughed hysterically about it. It was to a table full of only girls. He got fired after one year of teaching."

A few months later, probably around March 2017, I was in the shower and I was listening to Forest by twenty one pilots on YouTube using my Microsoft surface. The next song that came on was Lost in the Moment. I was bawling. I was up till almost 2 am watching all of his music videos and losing my mind.

Remember the lyrics I wrote down in 2016? I never actually looked them up but that same night I was watching all the music videos I also  listened to the song Mansion and it hit me. That was the song I heard on the radio station in 2016. Been a big fan ever since."

AskReddit,fmzxfyk,t3_fyccd5,1586531500.0,"We are all created in God‚Äôs image. Genesis says that He created us ‚Äúmale and female‚Äù. But it was then brought to my attention there are people who are intersex. Granted, I myself am not intersex, but when I learned intersex people exist, it totally changed my belief about LGBT+ and Christianity. Intersex people are biologically neither male nor female, right? And they are also made in the image of God. This leads me to believe that after Jesus died and rose again, gender became a non issue. I think intersex people are our modern day ‚Äúevidence‚Äù for what Paul says in Galatians. 

‚ÄúThere is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.‚Äù -Galatians 3:28
 
Once again, this leads me to believe that after Jesus‚Äô resurrection, gender became a non issue because there seems to be not only a spectrum in gender identity, but also in biological sex. So if gender isn‚Äôt an issue, then the gender of the person who you love must not be an issue either. I back this up with the verse in Romans.

‚ÄúLet no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love one another, for whoever loves others has fulfilled the law. The commandments, ‚ÄúYou shall not commit adultery,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou shall not murder,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou shall not steal,‚Äù ‚ÄúYou shall not covet,‚Äù and whatever other command there may be, are summed up( in this one command: ‚ÄúLove your neighbor as yourself.‚Äù Love does no harm to a neighbor.

CoronavirusWA,fmmpwdf,t1_fmmpr2q,1586209826.0,Yeah I 100% expected this. I‚Äôm a senior in high school. It‚Äôs a huge bummer for us.
CoronavirusWA,fmmpsli,t1_fmmpq3u,1586209769.0,Yup. There goes prom and a graduation ceremony.

I know I speak for so many other seniors when I say it‚Äôs heartbreaking to have to most likely miss those important milestones. Please continue to encourage the seniors in your lives. Do what you can to make them feel special and acknowledge the hard work they‚Äôve put in, it makes one heck of a difference."

4w5,fm6y8v2,t3_ftfw1m,1585806869.0,"I am 100% a music addict. 

The main genre(s) I listen to are alternative/alt-rock. I really like twenty one pilots, they‚Äôre my favorite band of all time. I also really enjoy listening to Of Monsters and Men, Coldplay, Two  Feet, half‚Ä¢alive, Bad Pony, Oasis, Kyd the Band, Billie Eilish, Pierce the Veil, Switchfoot, Sam Fender, Bon Iver, Colony House, Mumford and Sons, Jon Bellion, Queen, and the old Third Eye Blind and P!ATD. 

I also enjoy indie pop/rock. I like mxmtoon, SYML, Troye Sivan, Alec Benjamin, Cavetown, Luca Fogale, Girl in Red, Soccer Mommy and King Princess. 

Occasionally I‚Äôll listen to some pop like Hayley Kiyoko, Halsey, Selena Gomez, and Taylor Swift. Or some rap/hip-hop like NF, Kanye West, and J.Cole, but I‚Äôm very picky about the artists I listen to only a few artists in those genres."
