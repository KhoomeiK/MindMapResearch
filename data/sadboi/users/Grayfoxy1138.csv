Believe me, don’t believe me. This WAS my experience back in 2015. I know this for a fact because several people who id linked up with through Tinder also had eharmony accounts who had matched up with me, after I’d already, supposedly deleted my account.

3. They don’t delete or deactivate your account. Even if you never log back on, die, etc. it’s really bad you can read numerous examples of people getting match with people only to find out their deceased. I haven’t logged on for 5 plus years and my profile is still being rotated, it’s so fucked."

Business who are pissed that their employees are making more money “not working” from unemployment than they are willing to pay them at work. A person where I live can live like a king if they own their own house and make 50k or more a year. So fuck those asshats begging for their “GoFundMe” donations to save a “historical business”.

That’s why I love forensic files, it sticks to the facts and doesn’t glorify the killer. For those that are drawn sexually towards depictions of violence, there is tons of other outlets via porn, role playing, etc. To seek out sexual satisfaction originating from the factual details of crime is down right chilling to me."
