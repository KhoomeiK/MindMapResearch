BPD,fjlnk8w,t3_fe2xhr,1583450267.0,"So I've gone through something similar and I've had the exact thoughts you are having. I thought maybe I just despised myself and wanted to start a new slate in every way possible. I gradually stopped focusing on this discomfort in my own skin. I accepted that I am who I am and the transition to expressing my gender in a way that made me happy was not going to magically change the person I hated so much. I separated the concept of transitioning from my self loathing. Before hand, there was this bottomless pit my stomach would drop into when I saw myself in the mirror or when somebody would point out a masculine trait of mine. Afterwards, it was still there. It's still here. We're two totally different people, but my opinion is that you're overthinking it. You may feel allured by the notion that you can throw away your old self, but odds are, that's not the root of it. Most people who want to kill off their past self don't experience it like you're experiencing it. The bottom line is that if you think you'd be happier with a gender you weren't assigned, you'd probably be happier with a gender you weren't assigned. Whether or not you should transition is 100% up to you, though. The sad reality is that not everybody gets to transition who probably needs to. If I were to transition, I wouldn't have any sort of support system. I honestly don't think I would survive it. I hope someday that changes, but it's the way things are now, and so I've no plan to transition any time soon. Also, just a side note, for me once I really started paying attention to the way I felt about my assigned gender is when I REALLY started feeling uncomfortable. It seems like that may be your case, and that's normal. It's not really something most people have been raised to consider. If you feel like talking, you can always DM me. I probably won't get back to you immediately, but I will get back to you."

selfharm,f49dd9k,t3_djuqvv,1571462874.0,"Ive had the same problem before. I've transitioned into different methods that don't make me suffer as much. Obviously, it still isn't good, but it's WAY better than sleeping pills. Melatonin can give a good nudge depending on the dose, but it doesn't knock me out. 5 HTP works great for putting me to sleep but occasionally makes me feel bad the next day and you can't eat anything before or after you take it. Passion flower is great but tolerance racks up quick. Best thing is weed, but I don't smoke anymore because it's illegal and I got tired of dealing with everything that comes with that. I mostly drink and take melatonin now, but 5 HTP is very easy to get, and I'd highly recommend that before sleeping pills. I don't have to explain why sleeping pills are so awful because you probably already know, but if you just wanna knock yourself out, 5 HTP. You definitely can't drink with it though.

All that aside, I hope things get a little better for you, and I really feel you, believe me."

KeepWriting,f0t9sdh,t3_d5znpc,1568918353.0,"I really love the feeling I get when you're describing the sort of omnipresent darkness. The whole thing is really well done. My only critique, and it's not really even a critique, just something I've noticed people have a tendency to do, is the whole ""It's EVEN in..."" thing. Words that imply a contrast or exception, like but, even, yet, etc. are often used to create this sort of emphasis or exaggeration and it's a little bit misleading. It implies that either the thing before or the thing after is in opposition to the other and that one of those things is an obstacle to the other, or that one is contradictory to the other in general. It represents some sort of conflict that may not be what you're trying to express.

For example,
""I cherish the days when nothing mattered,
But I march forward into adulthood""
vs.
""I cherish the days when nothing mattered,
And I march forward into adulthood""

The first implies some sort of remorse, like it's hard to grow up because you miss being young. The second is a bit more neutral, like you don't miss being young. You enjoyed it, and now you are ready for the next step. 

Your case is different. It's just that the word 'even' makes me wonder why it's surprising or unsuspected that the darkness is also in the dawn. This may actually have been your intention, though, so I'm not saying that contrasting words are to be avoided. I'm just saying that a lot of times they're used in a way that doesn't mean what you're trying to say, and it's something I try to pay close attention to because I think it helps my writing as well as to better myself. I think we innately try to create conflict or comparisons that just aren't necessary.

...Just a tip for future writing, not necessarily for this. It's something small but it really changes the way I think about things. I really loved the poem!  Keep it up!"
OCPoetry,f0r2vw1,t3_d67njs,1568872582.0,"As far as execution goes, I think you did a good job. I like the whole ""Bats simply borrow The nighttime's wardrobe"" especially. My critique would be that it's sort of *too* straightforward. There isn't much room for speculation on what you're trying to convey. Poems are much more satisfying when you aren't completely sure what the writer is trying to convey. Figuring out what a poem means to you and what it might mean to the writer is personally my favorite part of analyzing poetry. I think you're good at painting a realistic picture. Maybe try painting an abstract picture."

I feel like both your father and death feel a sort of bliss in accepting each others' ""opposing"" roles, and that bliss is instilled in me when I read this."

I hate it, but I just want to be a good person. And this seems like the most feasible solution. I get scared about sharing it with people because I don't want to ""spread"" my negativity or mindset. There is something that I was more wary of sharing, and I'm wondering if you feel the same way. I feel like when I move, I'll either ""sink or float"". Meaning, either it'll solve most of my problems and I'll be able to function for a while, at least long enough to get better, or I'll end up killing myself, and either are perfectly fine solutions to me. I'll be disconnected from my family to the extent that it won't affect them too much, or at least in the most minimal way. It's a very dominant thought, and I feel like it's the real reason I want to move away. I'm just curious as to if you are the same... I feel really alone in having this mindset that I can't help."

I've changed everything on impulse so many times, and it looks terrible when applying for a new job. My motivation for staying right now is that is so that when I move (hopefully across the country), I'll be able to get a job easier. I want to be as far away from the people who care about me as I possibly can. I hate being such a burden on people. I feel like if I can get a job where I don't have to deal with any people, I can isolate my bullshit and not feel so awful for having to subject any coworkers or family to the emotional exhaustion that comes with being involved in my life.

BPD,ey4cpkk,t1_ey493cu,1566788167.0,"Lol all that is me. I've gradually stopped trying to talk to people at all. So many people rarely reply anyways. Of course, if I happen to see them in person, they cut up, call me their friend, and talk about hanging out sometime. Then when I actually try to initiate anything, people straight up ignore me. It's just confusing really. I can't tell when somebody is actually my friend so I stopped trying. For the most part, I'm comfortable with it. I'd rather not be a burden to anyone and my presence in a social setting always means people are going to have a worse time. The problem comes from how embarrassing it is not to have any friends at all. Also, I get really envious when I see people who have normal, functional relationships in which they genuinely enjoy each other's company."

And it's because my emotions are amplified. That is a part of bpd but it also presents itself in Asperger's, just for different reasons. The negativity building when in a group until you can't take it anymore does seem characteristic of bpd though. Lol I made a post yesterday about how hanging out with people makes it harder to hang out with people.

egg_irl,ey451my,t1_ev3pkti,1566782007.0,"I mean being transgender isn't a mental illness in any way, but I am sort of on the fence about gender dysphoria being a mental illness. People say cis girls don't like being called guys but I don't know about that. I feel like girls who are comfortable and confident in their gender identity don't always care. And that makes me feel like it is a mental disorder. But I do know cis girls who would care also. Im probably overthinking it, I mean, I guess it's sort of an extreme version of people going by their middle name because they don't like their first name, although that doesn't make a person depressed. I dunno. All that matters is a person's well being."

All I want is to save up some money, move to the city where I don't have to see the same people every day, find a job where I don't interact with anyone, and I feel like I may be able to make a level headed decision on whether or not I should keep doing this shit"
BPD,ey2jxfk,t1_ey293c3,1566741444.0,"Yeah I need to work towards being able to do that. Whenever I try to talk myself down, I just feel like I'm in denial of being a piece of shit, which makes me feel even worse. The only thing that makes me feel better is meditating on my feelings, feeling as much as I possibly can, accepting that I'm a monster, and accepting that I'm not meant to be around people.

If you don't want to be friends with me, that's fine, but don't tell me I'm your best fucking friend when I'm the least important person in your life! I feel so betrayed by everyone. Like just be honest, don't pretend like you actually like me. I gave up about a year ago, tried to kill myself. I called my mom afterwards and she told me to suck it up when I said nothing was worth it anymore. It a hell of a lot easier to ""suck it up"" when you have even one single person in your life that actually cares about you. All I have to say is that it's possible to find that person, even multiple people. So hold out through the agony. You'll die someday anyways.

BPD,ey19p45,t1_ey0w2b3,1566693642.0,Haha same! And at one point I just tried to accept it because I felt guilty for seeing it as a bad thing because I felt like I was an awful person for having anything to hide. It got to the point people would say something completely normal and mundane and I would crack up because I thought it was an inside joke on the premise of something I thought earlier that morning. I eventually had a psychotic break and quit my job by having somebody else pretend like they were me on the phone. I also thought everybody in my life was in like a sort of society that got together and just discussed my life and how to manipulate it in order to show how fucked up I am and make me a better person. It turned into a guessing game where I would try to figure out if somebody was a part of it when I met them. That was fun. Then I had an acid trip with some homeless guy and realized that nope I was just insane. He was cool. We hung out a few times afterwards.
mentalillness,exnyqt6,t3_ctubyk,1566466456.0,"A little over a year ago, I tried to kill myself with the same exact method. I'm much better now. I'm still depressed af but it's not as bad or as constant. I still have all of the same suicidal thoughts as I did then. Imagine a thought as a sort of creek in your brain. Giving power to this thought by thinking it or focusing on it at all pushes more water through it. A few months and its eroded to the size of a river. Water flows down this groove much easier, it doesn't wander wherever, it stays in the groove, or river. A year and it's starting to turn into a canyon. There's no possible way for the water to flow over the bank and start a new path. The original reason for the thought has disappeared and it's just there because you're programmed to think it. The mood stops being the cause of the thought and the thought turns into the cause of a mood. I'll never be able to fill in my canyon, all I can do is manage"

I alternate between going along with it because I really like them and I tell myself I'm crazy, making a big deal over nothing, and pushing them away because they don't see me as an equal human being.  Rinse and repeat. I feel horrible for how my baby emotions affect other people and eventually just stop trying to fix things because nobody should have to go through the bullshit I put out. Then people end up hating me because they think it's because I don't care about them. I don't think I'm capable of having a stable relationship with anyone. I hope things get better for you. I've not found any solution save for upturning my life and letting go of everyone I knew. Which isn't really a solution, I guess. Honestly, you're probably not a bother to anyone. People's lives are much bigger than one person and the reason someone doesn't reply or acknowledge you is usually about something in their life that's unrelated to you.

I largely keep it to myself though because I don't want to come off like I'm fetishising them. In high school I had determined that I had Low Latent Inhibition after some research. Then I sort of started to focus on the fact that it's kind of a determining factor in autism combined with the fact that society has started to see the spectrum as much broader and that's likely why LLI never really caught on in the psychology community, I mean there wasn't much of a point to it anymore. Then I started to put together how every single one of my friends were either officially diagnosed with autism or just strongly exhibited traits. My brother was diagnosed early on and I remember being tested for something and my parents not really telling me what happened. And growing up, my parents always mentioned how when they had my brother tested, the doctor just said to treat him no different than anybody else. My parents took that to the extreme though and my brother was constantly berrated for things he had little to no control over (I am not a fan of that doctor) but I'm pretty sure my parents knew I'm on the spectrum and decided to not ever tell me. Now I just sort of keep the very strong possibility that I'm on the spectrum in the back of my head at all times. I'm not really looking for any sort of label but it's immensely helpful to know why and how I'm different and that there are so many people who go through the same thing. I really wish I had known sooner tbh.

Went off on a tangent, but back to disorders, I'm really interested in schizophrenia in particular. There's so much to learn about it and there are constant updates and progress being made in the community. There is just so much, new and old, to discover.

And I know if I was a genetic girl there wouldn't even be a competition and we could all just play the game together, on the same team. And then I feel awful for resenting somebody for being who they are and being recognized for it because it's like the most innocent thing on their part.

trans,et8m269,t3_c8rtou,1562560831.0,Yeah this could be perfectly fine or very not fine just depending on how its written. I will say I am very curious to read it and wouldn't mind giving critique after you've written something. That's really the only way to tell if it would be offensive. Def iffy tho
trans,et8l3n7,t1_eoveyfa,1562559877.0,"I understand where both of you are coming from but if you're really wanting to help, be a friend, give advice, etc., with no ulterior motive, I'd try opening up a conversation in the comments next time and at least see if they talk to you before asking if they want to talk privately. From most people's point of view, it's sort of a red flag that you aren't truly sincere especially when most of your comment history is complimenting people's nsfw posts and/or then asking to DM. Not trying to troll or shame you but it is all very chaser-y and someone just decided to point it out. I don't think they meant to personally attack you. Being as immediately defensive as you were, I think you escalated things very quickly and came of as confrontational and aggressive. Maybe try having an actual conversation next time somebody offends you. You'll end up understanding each other a lot better."
depression,esfzn6s,t3_c7j5mr,1561939141.0,"I feel the exact same way. I feel like a pitiful excuse for a human being. I also happen to be stuck in a small town and the only thing that keeps me going is the thought that within a couple years I might be able to escape somewhere where people are different and I'll be able to change things. But I'm constantly trying to figure out if it's really worth the wait. You're not alone, for whatever it's worth."
asexuality,es85wyi,t3_c6cjt1,1561688637.0,"Mtf pre-transition egg here. I'm in a similar boat with that, I go back and forth with thinking I'm asexual and demisexual. I actually read an article the other day that's sort of about this. A trans woman thought she was only into guys before she transitioned and afterwards she grew to be comfortable with girls. Her explanation for this was that since she was insecure about her perceived masculinity, she didn't want to add to it by being with a woman while expressing as male. After she transitioned she was more secure with her gender and the idea of being with a woman didnt feel invalidating anymore. So for her the idea of it gave her dysphoria because she felt it reinforced society's misgendered perspective of her. Personally I'm panromantic but I definitely am more comfortable with the thought of dating a guy even though I'm equivalently attracted to any other gender. I'm not saying you or I for sure share the same problem as the woman in the article but it seemed significant enough to bring to the table."
egg_irl,es81ume,t3_c6csif,1561685859.0,Yeah fuck I thought that was normal too
asexuality,es80too,t3_c68wz4,1561685141.0,"I'm demisexual but I've only ever met a handful of people I was attracted to. I masturbate 1 or 2 times a week. For me its like stretching a tight muscle or popping your back. If I'm currently in a relationship and attracted to them and I think about them, then there's a sexual element to it but otherwise I'm not really mentally aroused and its just like a mechanical chore."
depression,eohr2bv,t1_eoh59sv,1558589662.0,I mean I dated somebody who was depressive bipolar and that's pretty much exactly what they experienced.
