bipolar,fkt1qhs,t3_fkj7tr,1584503839.0,I just started it 2 weeks ago. I think it started taking effect this week. I was definitely in a depressive episode and now I'm feeling much better. So give it a little time
bipolar2,fki7d8z,t3_fidtxu,1584213381.0,Thank you guys for all your help!! I called my insurance a and it should only be $40 per month. So that is a relief!
bipolar2,fki0er5,t1_fki0den,1584209390.0,Thank you!!
bipolar2,fkgnzgw,t1_fkgnweo,1584166483.0,"Mine too! Thanksgiving, March, and late summer I go manic almost every year"
bipolar2,fkgnq3d,t1_fkgn9ha,1584166178.0,"Oh yikes!!! I'm on lamictal and vraylar right now. I'm just feeling a little too good. Ya know what I mean. I'm not hyper yet but I feel like it's a ""yet"". Like it's coming"
bipolar2,fkgn47i,t1_fkgn1bg,1584165484.0,I'm feeling really good on it so far. Hoping it's not the beginning of mania...
bipolar2,fkgmxr6,t1_fkgmwrf,1584165280.0,Oh no! I can't afford that! Did you stay on it?
bipolar2,fjry190,t1_fjprb08,1583591342.0,I'm hoping it has the same effect on me.
bipolar2,fjrxvuy,t1_fjpzxd7,1583591290.0,I'll watch out for those. I have a rescue med for that but hopefully I won't need it
bipolar2,fix12mv,t1_fitds0a,1582809874.0,I haven't tried that many meds cuz the docs keep giving me the same things even though I've asked for different. I need to speak up more.
bipolar2,fitsamr,t1_fitr3bc,1582728272.0,No I don't track my moods. Maybe I should...
bipolar2,feei2ou,t1_fee4jk5,1579034186.0,I'm gonna see how the next week or two go before I call her. But ugh!
bipolar2,fee3pf0,t1_fedz523,1579025752.0,I'm on abilify and lamictal
bipolar2,fedytmw,t1_fedthy1,1579022765.0,That's my usual when not medicated but I think these swings might be caused by my meds
BipolarReddit,fdnm1g9,t3_em20h6,1578588613.0,I am currently dealing with this. It's like an identity crisis. I don't know who I am on meds. It's different and I'm having a hard time accepting that the extreme emotions won't be there since they made up so much of who I am. Good luck with your journey to acceptance!
bipolar,fdcmf33,t3_ekkifi,1578278531.0,I'm going to get a similar one soon!
bipolar2,fd6dzvc,t1_fd6drq9,1578189532.0,I tried 200 and got more depressed so we backed off that and upped the abilify to 10 instead. I dunno what to do. Today I'm definitely hypomanic so we'll see how long this lasts
bipolar2,fd6d1w4,t1_fd62six,1578189112.0,I'm on 150 of lamictal too and 10 of abilify. I'm still having swings and definitely self harm thoughts. I'm getting so fed up and kinda wanting to go off them all together despite knowing that's not a good idea.
bipolar,fd5ru4a,t3_ek141m,1578180779.0,Yep!! My husband now better understands why I ditched him so many times when we're first started dating.
bipolar2,fckoybi,t1_fcjfw3q,1577730048.0,I will check with the doc. It is annoying for sure and on bad days it can spark panic attacks which is not helpful to my wellbeing at all. Hopefully the doc can help
bipolar2,fcjempw,t1_fcj9fwr,1577684870.0,It's more like intrusive thoughts. Today I was fine and then out of nowhere I start thinking it'd be nice to die in a car crash. It happens a lot when I drive no matter the mood of the day.
bipolar2,fbaj0ls,t1_fbafjsp,1576679441.0,I wonder if I'll get there...
bipolar2,fbaimzt,t1_fb9rclr,1576679164.0,Thanks! Definitely still figuring this all out. I pretty much spent 10 years in denial after my diagnosis so it's like this is all new to me
bipolar2,fb9lb5k,t1_fb9j5le,1576641695.0,Thanks! I hope you find it too! I guess I was hoping I didn't have to feel like a zombie. The last time I did medication it sent me hypomanic for like 8 months before I went off them so I probably have unrealistic expectations for how I'm suppose to feel. Good luck with the healthy living I hope it all works out for you!
bipolar2,fb9l0nk,t1_fb9bxfe,1576641456.0,I guess it's just one of those nights where I'm reminiscing about the fun and ignoring all the bad that comes. The bad that made me seek help in the first place. I have no reserves of energy left to handle any swings anymore so if bland and boring is what I've got to deal with to get my energy back maybe I should stick with it.
BipolarReddit,fa0e55u,t3_e7ikgc,1575753651.0,I get this a lot. Thought i was the only one. Sometimes its just my head sometimes it's my whole body. I hate it!
bipolar,f9qxijw,t3_e6bxnz,1575568337.0,I was on wellbutrin for a year and oh man i got so much done! This mossy tree sent time being on it tho it made me negatively jittery and feel like i wanted to crawl out of my skin. I have a better doctor now though and she took me off of it. She says I can't be on other antidepressants now because of the way I reacted she thinks they'll all do that. I'm on 2 mood stabilizers now and trying to work out the swings. Good luck with your journey!
bipolar,f9qlqc0,t3_e6j99e,1575563238.0,Lol lamictal and abilify. Im not sure the lamictal description fits but abilify for sure!!
bipolar2,f9pbljl,t1_f9p9q1f,1575528507.0,Good to know! Thanks!
bipolar2,f9oxpl8,t1_f9ow6fq,1575516212.0,Doc said symptoms should be a bit better by now so to try going down a little on the lamictal and up on the abilify. She said I should know in a few days if it's working. I just hate the hopelessness that is depression. Even giving something a reasonable amount of time to work sounds unbearable.
bipolar2,f9o691v,t1_f9o3hm7,1575497364.0,I should probably find a therapist but it's hard to find one that knows how to deal with bipolar. My last one had to get out a workbook cuz she was so unfamiliar with it. Thanks for understanding. It all feels so hopeless like why even bother with the meds at all. I know i should tho cuz anything's got to be better than this but it's hard to remember that.
bipolar2,f9o5puw,t1_f9o2yvj,1575497050.0,I've been on meds this time for 2 months now. I know that's not long but it's beginning to feel like forever. Haven't done any therapy. I've had bad experiences before but the DBT therapy seemed to be helpful. Thanks for your kind words
bipolar,f9ixlrj,t3_e5bnqg,1575348791.0,Me too! I always buy a new planner and organize the whole year with markers and holiday stickers only to abandon it again till the next episode
BipolarReddit,f9ixets,t3_e53gbe,1575348626.0,"I was on abilify and wellbutrin for a year and spent about 8 months of that in what I now realize was hypomania before coming off the meds for 2 months (which was a hellish mixed episode). When I went back on meds I went on those two plus lamictal but found the wellbutrin was again making me hypomanic. My new doc says that because I'd this reaction I shouldn't take antidepressants anymore and looking back at years where I got help for the depression they did make me jittery and hyper so I probably should never have been put on antidepressants at all.

Everyone is different though so it may be an option for you with close monitoring by doc."
bipolar,f9iws2v,t3_e57j5d,1575348087.0,I had to appeal for SAP once after I failed a semester due to moods swings (that is when I first got diagnosed bipolar). I was just honest in the explanation of what was going on and informed them of my diagnosis. I think they just want to know that there is a valid reason behind the failing grades and not just laziness ya know. That was about 12 years ago so not sure if it's still the same but I had good luck with it. It's worth a shot to appeal. The worst they can do is deny it but that would be the same if you don't at least try
bipolar,f9e9f2g,t1_f9cib2c,1575241150.0,Oooo i like that idea!!
BipolarReddit,f8t1vfi,t3_e20aot,1574793991.0,I was diagnosed with recurrent depression around 15 and then atypical bipolar at 20 then bipolar 2 last year. So I guess it's been about 12 years since the beginning. Looking back at teen years I see the signs of hypomania activity/creativity when I wasn't depressed and then rapid cycling when I was 20. I think it was always there it just took me a long time to finally have had enough of it to seek out help.
bipolar2,f8sls1k,t3_e1oodu,1574783786.0,I'm in the new stages of going back on meds too. The antidepressant have me irritable hypomania and anxiety so doc says I can't be on antidepressants because they will all give me that effect now. I'm on abilify and lamictal. Getting panic attacks and weepy again so hoping to go up to 200mg of lamictal and see if that helps. It's hard to give up control to the medication but it seems the only way since I obviously couldn't control my mood swings. Good luck with your journey!!
BipolarReddit,f8fwinr,t3_e0oz95,1574550469.0,When I took it I would get surges of energy a few hours after dose. It was weird. It also kept me hypomanic despite the mood stabilizer so ultimately I stopped taking it
bipolar,f8bn2bh,t3_e02l64,1574440719.0,I met my husband 10 years ago and at the beginning i was unmedicated and dipped out on him so many times due to moods swings and unhealthy behaviour. About 7 years ago I finally settled down for a bit and let him officially into my life. We've been together ever since despite the mood swings lol and we just got married this summer. It can happen. There is someone or there for everyone!
bipolar,f86g47s,t1_f86fz2q,1574297331.0,Mine too! This week I've baked and made jam today! Mixed episode and getting on meds kinda messes with the productivity lol
bipolar,f85ycv8,t1_f85rhxa,1574285900.0,What else do you make? I make jam and baked goodies
bipolar,f85kmho,t3_dz1mit,1574277268.0,I'm glad to see others bake with their nervous energy too!!
bipolar,f7qvzyg,t3_dxibwt,1573970530.0,"I've been on lamotrigine for about 5 weeks and find my skin gets red easier, like from sun or over exerting myself. But no definite rash"
bipolar_irl,f7mcswx,t3_dwq7xm,1573859852.0,I often joke about my moods and overall unstable nature. That way people can't say I didn't warn them lol
bipolar2,f7l8e84,t3_dwqq9w,1573834948.0,I liked it. It wasn't exactly what I go through but a good representation of what relationships can be like while unmedicated. I had my husband watch it and now he had a better understanding of what went on when we were dating so I think it was ultimately helpful
bipolar2,f7kwptu,t1_f7km18f,1573827972.0,So true the calm before the storm!!
bipolar2,f7jehkp,t3_dwh1yx,1573775912.0,I get this a lot. Makes me think I can't be hypomanic but then it all starts again. Not sure what to think of it
bipolar2,f6t8d1b,t1_f6t52q8,1573145391.0,Thank you for the warning. I have the .5mg dose. I took one yesterday and just kinda felt a bit buzzing in my body but not too bad. I really hope it works for the anxiety attacks.  At the same time I've eliminated the wellbutrin that had been causing the crazy crawl outta my skin feelings that give me attacks so hopefully that helps. Today is day one without it and I feel really weird. Not sure if it's from the lorazepam yesterday or the lack of energy from the wellbutrin. Just feel like something is missing. I'm not sure if I like this feeling any more than the craziness. Ugh it's all so weird!!
bipolar2,f6r7f35,t1_f6r4z8v,1573095626.0,I'm really gonna try to make sure I don't abuse it and just use as a rescue med occasionally
bipolar2,f6qpdpb,t1_f6qp7mc,1573082579.0,Good idea! I've been trying to find a way to knock that hypomania out. I'll have to keep that one in mind
bipolar,f6o5cum,t3_ds37a9,1573008102.0,I just ordered this. Is it any good?
bipolar,f685dha,t3_dqoxh6,1572725658.0,"I almost always get manic in December, March, and September. I just recently was talking about this and it was brought to my attention. It explains a lot!!"
bipolar,f61rzbp,t1_f61kpwd,1572645534.0,I didn't even know about them till I had one recently lol
bipolar,f61i2xz,t3_dq8qle,1572640634.0,I tried and ended up in the worst mixed episode
bipolar2,f60wowy,t3_dq687y,1572627757.0,Yes I've been sick lately and had to stop taking them for that exact reason. The nasal spray decongestants work better without those side effects because it just goes to your sinuses. Since switching my cold has cleared better than with the pills
bipolar,f5muyhd,t3_dodvil,1572293942.0,I just saw it this morning!! I thought it was one odd the best depictions of bipolar that I've seen. I do agree that the immediate switch from manic to unable to move depression is exaggerated but that may just be my experience. My switching between moods is more subtle and takes a bit of time except when I rapid cycle or am in a mixed episode.
bipolar,f5i5q25,t3_dnx5xg,1572211211.0,Is that what that feeling is called? I get that all the time! Like I can't move but I'm going to explode from the pressure inside my body and I get super anxious
bipolar,f4gkx6p,t1_f4d8915,1571582032.0,Thanks for the info! I only have muscle pain so far but I will be vigilant just in case
bipolar,f4gkjf5,t1_f4ejkkm,1571581985.0,I have that off and on all the time so not sure if it is related. I wonder if maybe all the stress from this latest mixed episode is showing in my muscles now that I'm calming down.
bipolar,f4gjzqr,t1_f4fvs2l,1571581808.0,Thanks! That's what I thought the doc told me about it. It's just so weird
bipolar,f4d5ten,t3_dkcbn1,1571538374.0,I just started that on Wednesday and I got so nauseated and sleepy all day from it so I decided to take it before bed last night and today I feel much better!
bipolar2,f38r0qa,t1_f38nuvh,1570739069.0,Thanks anyways. Trying to hold on and hoping the doc will understand how bad it is when I get there
bipolar2,f38nlxd,t1_f38jkjv,1570738162.0,Thanks
bipolar,f37ety4,t3_dfy09d,1570725043.0,Needed top hear this today
bipolar,f2awau9,t3_dcsowv,1570118578.0,Me too.  Always seem to be swinging. I was so productive on meds that now that I'm off them I wonder if it wasn't hypomania fueling it. I don't know anymore
bipolar,f1kfcnh,t3_d9qara,1569535024.0,Yes! But I get the buzzing all over like all my cells are vibrating
bipolar2,f1f4tv3,t3_d8y2tg,1569436994.0,I'm at work now just trying to be more talkative and moving around more so I can stop getting do stuck inside my head. It's actually kinda working and I'm beginning to feel more lighthearted less anxious
bipolar2,f1eu849,t3_d8y2tg,1569430358.0,Oh ok thanks. I need something like that. I have insurance again finally so I need to go back to the doc.
bipolar2,f1eljrp,t1_f1eja8c,1569424969.0,How can I turn this around into something more enjoyable? This angsty business is not ok. I thought i felt something coming on last week but I was not expecting this
bipolar2,f1elcc4,t1_f1dp1d9,1569424836.0,What is a PRN?
bipolar,f1bo6ky,t3_d8nclr,1569339171.0,I definitely think it's like a drug. I feel like I've been itching for the high for a week now. Doing things to trigger it hoping for just a taste of that energy/ excitement knowing full well that it will go bad in the end. But it's all I can think about
bipolar,f15cibv,t1_f148u7l,1569187882.0,Me too! All I accomplished was making myself throw up from too many energy drinks! But im gonna keep trying cuz I'm so over the depression!!
BipolarReddit,f0vzf3v,t3_d6wm6l,1568995450.0,Yep seems like every year! Right around this time and in the spring too.
bipolar,f0vz4f5,t3_d6loq3,1568995245.0,Me this week!! So skeptical!
bipolar2,f0q5oey,t1_f0osi4x,1568854331.0,I just went off my meds so now I'm not sure how it will all pan out. It's a really weird feeling and I don't trust it
bipolar,eys9roa,t3_cyd1sv,1567391317.0,So me right now! I ran out of my antidepressant so instead Im taking diet pills to help with energy boost. We'll see what kind of me comes out of this combo!!
