I think having a dialogue system in RPGs is a necessity for me, as I am not able to believe a world if I cannot talk to those who inhabit it. I think Undertale and Deltarune are great examples of how a talking system rather than a fighting system can still be rewarding. Talking your way through battles in Undertale is far funnier and more challenging than just killing them, and I think more RPGs should pick up on that."
