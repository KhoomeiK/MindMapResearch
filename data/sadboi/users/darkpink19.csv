bipolar2,fqv2w3n,t3_gl3i6i,1589668784.0,I feel for you and have had a rough couple of days too. So frustrating and hard to deal with my thoughts. And honestly breaks my heart when I miss “myself” in this state. Hope you find some peace today.
mentalillness,fqtb51l,t3_gkguw7,1589635101.0,"Yes yes yes. Hard to accept that my greatest hobby is distracting myself from just being with myself. 

I’ve been trying hard to change this a little bit when I have periods of time with more stability and I try to do the things I used to enjoy as a child lol. Examples - I go outside in the sun and sit in the grass and eat my lunch, I take walks downtown with my depression friend and we try to beat our record of how many dogs we can pet, I practice being alone in my head but I listen to music and smash play dough in my hands for sensory input and so I’m kinda distracted, forced myself to play piano again (when I have the motivation) and it’s distracting but enjoying, and go once a week to this bakery and try something new (with my depression friend of course). 

Yup. So don’t worry it’s not like I’m all jolly and loving life doing this stuff, but it makes me feel more real to try doing things that bring a tinge of enjoyment. And if I do them while I’m not in a dark hole, when I get back in the hole the association of enjoyment with random shit like I mentioned is there a bit. Also just transitioning from oh this is all just distractions to oh I do enjoy this distraction at least 10% is cool. We do choose our distractions and that is something individualistic I guess, like not everyone lives on a bipolar sub on reddit like me lmao."

I will talk so much and lead all the conversations, how annoying of me. And will dance in my room and listen to beetles, pretty much feeling them in my bones OR I’m in the car listening to EDM and then realizing woah I don’t like EDM and feel like I’m on Molly and Coke. Sooooo yep. It’s not crazy noticeable for me and I didn’t realize what it was until I was diagnosed. Just thought I had depression and then sometimes major relief and happiness for awhile. Now I’ve had some higher hypomanic episodes, but still nothing crazy and then they end in the worst periods of suicidal mixed states.

I can’t feel much emotion in general while depressed but I can feel a slight tinge of it when I think about those moments and remind myself that this person who experienced that is still there - with the right balance of brain chemistry. Please hold on with me. Remember what it feels like to get back up and have moments that you are grateful you didn’t end your life.

bipolar2,fp8kbca,t1_fp8engm,1588394571.0,"Yes I totally agree with this. Letting your child in on what’s going on and why you need some space could relieve some of the anxieties she is feeling. My mom has depression and would be gone mentally for many years and/or only focus on her work all day everyday. I never understood it and I just felt unwanted, annoying and put on the back burner. She never talked to me about what was going on and since I was diagnosed with BP it’s super uncomfortable discussing things with them bc there has never been open conversations about mental health. Anyway, my point is that opening up a bit to your child and educating her can benefit both of you so much! I really hope things start going up for you, it’s so hard to take care of kids while you’re in pain."

I even made a friend there and it’s so much easier hanging with her because we don’t judge each other. Maybe there is a group like that around you? I found mine on NAMI’s website. I’ve seen ones for people with all mental illnesses to go to so that might be a good option. Really hope you can find people who get you and feel that love.

And then even if you can trust someone, they are not responsive and too uncomfortable about those kinds of conversations when you are in pain. 

I’ve been bipolar for awhile (after much reflection after being diagnosed lol) but it hit hard after a very stressful/rough time in my life. Since the bipolar brick smashed into my head, my relationships with my old friends that I’ve known for years was different because they can’t relate to my life and experiences. So when I’m with them and depressed, I’m just being the old me and faking it. And I don’t expect everyone I know to be a therapist and constantly checking on me at all and I know that they can’t help not being able to relate at all and to get it.... but it would be nice if my friends/family were to try to get it and ask me about and not run from theses convos!!! My family sucks with that and saying bipolar is like saying Voldemort.

Start with a how are you/how have you been and then:

- where do you work (if you don’t know)/ what do you do exactly in that role/how is work going?/Do you like your job? 

- if younger like in school: what HS or college do you go to?/ do you play sports or involved in anything? If college - what are you studying?

- if this is just a chill convo like you see somebody randomly that you know - how have you been? I haven’t seen you in a while, what have you been up to? And tell them what you’re up to or why you are wherever you are/How is _____ (maybe a family member)? 

Other topics: what you do at school/work, restaurants/bars/food if you are in that setting and you can talk about places you like or dislike and where you have gone in the past or recently, sports games, Netflix shows (like if a friend asks what you’ve been up to and you can’t think of anything just say well not much actually haha I’ve been bingeing ______ and that’s taking up most of my time, talking about travel and where you’ve been or want to go, etc

I’m in grad school and very much relate to the issues with school. I don’t have any amazing advice other than trying not to totally lose your shit. With school work I just do the bare minimum and don’t set high expectations for myself. I try to do as much as I can when I’m not super irritable or in breakdown central. If things are late, but I can finish them the next day and do a better job so be it. I know that I will make up for it as I continue on and get back to a shit depression lmao. Same goes for socializing, I only push myself to be around other people when I’m not super irritable and take it in small doses. Even calling people for support or distraction helps me, even though I don’t want to at the time. I also distract myself as much as I can during the day - always playing music and focusing hard on the lyrics to get out of my head, watching a show while smooshing clay/play dough (I know that sounds weird af but helps me stay kinda occupied), etc. I also tend to want to feel pain during mixed episodes, I’ve never hurt myself besides punching my dresser a few times (not sure why the dresser) but I will stretch all the time because it hurts and is very distracting haha. May not be the move for you, but I was in cheerleading/gymnastics so kinda a familiar routine that helps me feel kinda ok. So anything like that/something that is mindless for you could be beneficial?  

Yeah that’s all I got. Sorry for the long essay. Feels endless, but it never is. I really hope you get through this soon and you find some peace."

mentalillness,fok67jp,t3_g7pfce,1587836136.0,"Yes I think it’s creeping into the “culture” of it all, idk if that’s the right word for it. Many people feel that their pain is incomparable because it is their experience; We can relate to, but not feel others pain. I think most people have this thought in a dark/very painful point in their lives, I have. 

It’s toxic thought because it’s invalidating and can be isolating for people. I sometimes get frustrated when people say they are depressed when they really mean sad or call someone bipolar when someone just has anger issues or is just cruel to others at times. BUT I have to remind myself that just because maybe the person is “just” experiencing sadness, this can really be affecting them and I shouldn’t dismiss it because I believe I have it worse. Nobody gets through life unscathed, so I think it’s important to understand how mental health/illness is a unique and individual experience that affects people in all different ways.

Your husband sounds like an amazing and understanding man, try your best not to believe that the shame you feel is the same as what he feels and sees in you. You can do this!!!! And I’m so happy you’re giving food psych a try, that helped me more than anything. Also, I found a dietician that focused on intuitive eating (the book “intuitive eating” is great) and improving ppls relationship with food. She was recommended to my by my therapist and it was so nice to have her help. Just be careful not to go to a dietician that is all focused on weight loss and restriction.... many of them have a bad relationship with food as well. Weight loss does not equal health and focusing on that destroys your mental health as well. Okay I’m done ranting haha just a little passionate now. Much luck back to you!"

If anything you are resilient for continue to function and not just giving up. It’s exhausting. 

I take my meds for my physical issues and mental and remind myself that they are all connected for me to be okay. But even though I know and remind myself of that.... I still feel those feelings of anger towards needing to rely on them my whole life. It’s so fucking scary to know I have to rely on them to function and stay alive. 

I miss myself all the time and hate the person my depression makes me become. I question who the hell I am anymore bc I don’t get to be “me” very often. I’m sorry your hurting and just existing rather than living and enjoying life. I’m there with you and I hope you find some relief soon."

mentalillness,fntytic,t3_g3qbrh,1587251207.0,"I have bipolar type 2 and it was triggered about 9 months ago. Before that I didn’t have suicidal thoughts. Living with them now I have such a profound understanding of the misery people experience that pushes their brain to those thoughts. When I am close to active suicidal ideation, I don’t truly want to die I want the endless pain to stop and my mind questions if it is worth living if this deep depression is always waiting to come back. It’s so scary and sad to lose yourself like that and to hate being alive. 

I would say in those times, most people need people to be okay with an uncomfortable conversation(s) and listen to what’s going on. When people say suicide is selfish (which I understand why) I’m bothered because this person who took their life is uncomfortable and in pain every minute of everyday and most of the people in their life exhibit selfishness in not truly being in it with them. I usually get about twice a week to open up about what’s going on while really suicidal/depressed. I don’t blame ppl bc it’s exhausting to care about someone with a mental illness, but listening and caring make a difference. It’s lonely and when you talk about it nobody wants to remain on the topic for too long, I know now to never move on when someone is opening up and in such a vulnerable state because it adds to the isolation and it hurts.

Another great thing for family/friends to do is write letters for the person about how much you love/care/empathize for them to open read in their darkest times. 

So I don’t have any amazing advice, but that’s just my experience and what could help."
bipolar2,fntlxqo,t3_g3s135,1587244307.0,"I believe the first thing to do is working on your relationship with food. I have struggled and still struggle with it and it took me a long time to truly get to a better place - it’s very much worth it. It’s important not to go 0 to 100 with restricting food and exercising and all that Jazz. Little steps like working on letting go of the shame of eating and accepting your body for where it’s at (I am not saying that is easy at all and takes work obvi). That doesn’t mean you have to love it, but try to accept it more. I truly feel for you and hope for the best! Small goals and don’t beat yourself up. Just functioning in life with a mental illness is impressive. 

Also “Food Psych” is an amazing podcast on Spotify (not sure where else). It has helped me so much."

mentalillness,fnr0urk,t3_g3ae1w,1587176603.0,"I’m not here with anything real inspiring over here, I just want to say that that really fucking sucks and I’m sorry you have to feel all that pain right now. I always remind myself that everyone has their own timeline and it’s no better or worse than other people’s. You’re resilient for still being on this earth and one day you will want to live for yourself and not just for others. I’m on and off suicidal all the time and it’s so shitty and sometimes I do just life for my family, but other times things go up in my life and I live for myself. I don’t always believe that it’s so worth it to keep going on when I’m hitting rock bottom, but I continue to decide that I’m not going to let life go because there will always be more moments of joy. High school SUCKS ASS, but it is far from a representation of the rest of your life. Actually the farthest thing from it. I’ll bet you have experienced more and know more about life than most of your classmates, based on what you’re going through, and just because they have success rn in school doesn’t make them better than you.

Really hope you find some peace. I don’t know you, but I truly care that you continue to live and get to experience the good that will be in your future. Sending a virtual hug (way more than 6ft apart ;))."
bipolar2,fnnaana,t1_fnn159r,1587087859.0,I’m super happy for you! Thats a huge deal and some great timing lol. It sucks having to distract yourself all day to be okay existing. I get so angry that most of my life is avoiding truly spending time with myself. Makes me miss me because when I’m good I really do like being in my head.
bipolar2,fnmhgju,t1_fnmgr8p,1587071500.0,Yes I feel you. I try the breathing and then get pissed. Ya I fight all the feelings and thoughts and then it makes me overwhelmed and worse off. Trying really hard to be more passive about them. Sometimes I can’t cry but when I can or even just lay there and give myself time to feel it all while I’m laying there. I hate it but I tend to have an easier time moving on a bit and trying to sleep. There is less perseveration and racing thoughts after it because I addressed them. It’s my only sense of control.
bipolar2,fnmfbk9,t1_fnmdlld,1587070400.0,"social media (other than reddit of course). 

I have a little speaker and if I know shits going down in my head or it’s been 30 mins of trying, I will hold it and play soft music and focus on the lyrics. It’s a bit calming, kinda distracts me and is better than just laying there. Another thing that can work a little is imaging myself in a calming/pretty place. I choose the beach and think about all the different sensory stuff there and how I feel at the beach. Kinda setting the scene and everything I want to feel/see/smell there. And I don’t fight the thoughts (kinda) and just tell myself that Im at the beach with these thoughts. That way I don’t go the thought process of “this is bull shit and not gonna work” bc that’s usually my response to trying to DBT/CBT myself. Sorry this sounds a bit crazy, but I can’t fight the crazy so I use it lmao"
bipolar2,fnmc0q4,t3_g2i6u4,1587068709.0,I relate! I dread and fear nighttime (depending on how dark I am). The second I lay down alone and especially when I close my eyes I realize how miserable I am without distractions. All the suicidal ideation that just poked at me all day and all the other good stuff just hitttt and im stuck awake for 1-2hrs with my thoughts. Sucks ass.
bipolar2,fnh5ldw,t3_g1mkd1,1586955411.0,"I relate very very much. I’ve learned on this sub that many people enjoy their hypomania, but I feel the same way as you. You’re super intuitive and have a good understanding of every nuance going on. It’s a good thing and sometimes really bad bc of realizing what you need to control, but suffering more from it all. IT IS EXHAUSTING!!! 

You should feel very proud of yourself for how hard you work to not let the hypomania ruin your life, but I’m sorry you are in that state. Thanks for sharing bc makes me feel less alone and crazy. Sending you virtual empathy and love."
bipolar2,fnfnvx2,t3_g1cwnr,1586911824.0,"I didn’t realize this is where I’m at right now until reading your post. Im sorry you feel that dead end. I’m just in the middle of truly wishing I never existed or could die in my sleep and well here I am stuck with a negative persecution of my future full of limited happiness. I’m kinda ok during the days now and then I lay in bed alone and I’m breaking down, a weird shitty “phase” of depression. I truly hope things go up for you and thank you for your post."
AskReddit,fn6g1ag,t3_fz5363,1586698282.0,"I’m what would be considered “suicidal” which the term sounds like I’m going to do it, but I never will even if I wanna die real bad. These thoughts are mostly out of my control. I don’t have the chemicals in my brain to be myself and have my normal perspective and thoughts, I’m in extreme emotional pain and I don’t sleep. SO the brain goes straight to “I desperately need relief” so poor suicidal thoughts constantly. They are either kind of a relief bc I would do anything not to exist or annoying bc I’m not dark enough to have no hope or desire to live! 

Got hit with all this 6 months ago, so it breaks my heart I’m not “me” most of the time. I now have I profound understanding of what ppl go through when they are suicidal, I used to just think like “ok why do you need to jump to that conclusion, that’s horrible.”"
bipolar2,fn4kq4z,t3_fz8dbe,1586643374.0,I 100% relate. It’s hard to have spontaneous conversation. I lose the desire to talk about anything in my day/anything at all. It feels worthless/pointless bc nothing matters. It’s like I have no thoughts other than emotionally painful ones. Like an empty dark brain.
funny,fmqng20,t1_fmqmtx4,1586303091.0,Ugh that sounds extremely difficult. And I’m sure you have worked so hard to face the social anxiety and ease into being social/pushing yourself. Maybe just try your best to be semi-social virtually or just taking walks so at least you’re around ppl a bit (at a good distance lol). Really hope you have some peace.
funny,fmqjz1k,t1_fmq7rrd,1586301103.0,I have bipolar too and this whole thing has destroyed a lot of the work I did to come out of my depression. Real rough. It’s great that she has an understand advocate like you! Best wishes for you both.
funny,fmqjou4,t1_fmq8g4s,1586300937.0,Lol yes I’m for real bipolar af and high key falling apart. I was finally happy/normal for 2 weeks after 6 months of a hellish depression and then this hit and I’m going back down. Hope you are doing okay!
bipolar2,fm64hmf,t1_fm64dnm,1585786094.0,YES same. I almost get a panic when I have to be in my room alone on a dark day. It’s horrible to not like being with yourself.
bipolar2,fm2hja8,t3_fsd8az,1585697602.0,"Love the random mid-day crash and breakdown, like oh let’s decide I want to die a lil’, and then I’m up and making dinner like ooo ya this is fine and actually I’m all good and not totally plummeting into darkness. The in bed like oh wait yes I am."
bipolar,flotlqv,t3_fq5i60,1585345219.0,This is amazing.
holdmyjuicebox,flm6bxz,t1_flm54ub,1585275607.0,Lmao *assumes the child is neglected and his parents give him no attention bc in that moment the TV was on and the child was standing by his parents* Apparently the only good parents out there never raise their voice and just stare into their child’s eyes 24/7 to make sure they grow up ok.
bipolar2,flllevc,t1_flkdl6a,1585262718.0,Haha same I cried in my car for the opposite reason. Really tried to convince my psych it was anxiety and depression lol he saw right through me.
bipolar2,fl4aeyu,t3_fm9nqj,1584809387.0,It’s fucking torture. I’m like “Yes I survived the day! Now it’s time to finally be unconscious and have an ounce of peace.” And my brains like “nah dude we are gonna stay up and continue to increase the speed of your thoughts until the sun comes back up”
bipolar2,fl497jr,t3_fmffqf,1584808661.0,"Same! He ghosted me so that was horrible, but I had just started to feel happy for the 2 weeks before that for the first time in sooo long. I’m sorry you’re going through that rn. What I’ve been doing is just knowing that there is a reason for this slip into depression and it’s not just a random brain chemistry shift. So I know that as I heel I can come out of it bc the depression was caused by an actual life event. It makes me feel a bit better and slowly I have been improving and getting past the pure frustration of losing my ability to feel joy. Let yourself feel the sadness from the break up though bc fighting it (my natural response) just makes it worse and pushes it deeper into your mind. Best of luck to you, hope things start going back up again."
AskReddit,fkytoii,t1_fkxlrb7,1584655936.0,"Called it from the start bc my cousin has schizophrenia, poor Brian :("
bipolar2,fkp5hbs,t1_fkp3iiu,1584402238.0,"It’s so shitty. Haha one good thing out of the coronavirus, that we can educate from afar with our fuzzy lamictal brains. I’m finishing up grad school rn and in clinicals and it’s so frustrating looking so dumb and not being able to speak and write as proficient as I used to. I’m typically a great writer, especially when it comes to medical stuff/documentation but it’s shit now. Hope all goes well for you!"
bipolar2,fkovi9i,t1_fko5su1,1584395935.0,"Thank you, hope you continue on a an upswing! Well not too far up haha. And ya nights are miserable, always in breakdown central. Meds have been a real struggle this year and still figuring it out but I am better than I was 6m ago so I’m grateful for that."
bipolar2,fko50gu,t3_fjnins,1584380230.0,I can relate but no. As I adjust to upping my dosage it gets better. But my word finding is shit and I just can’t keep up mentally at work and school like I used to. Legit will lose my train of thought or what I’m talking about and  there is NO going back it’s just gone gone lol. So annoying.
bipolar2,fko4qby,t3_fjb21i,1584380074.0,Fucking same rn. Thanks for sharing. Saying it’s frustrating is an understatement and it’s painful to lose the ability to feel joy. Like taking candy from a baby. I’m currently crumbling and so so sad for myself. And I cry the hardest when I think about how much I miss “myself” during these times. It hurts SO bad. And I go straight into suicidal ideation whether I want to or not.
bipolar2,fkamrja,t3_fh69ax,1584013754.0,"I used to have an issue with binge eating and restricting foods. Everything had to be controlled at all times and when I ate a “bad food” I would feel out of control and so much guilt. NOT saying that this is you, but the way I worked on my binging and restricting is to follow intuitive eating and restrict nothing. So I practice gentle nutrition they call it, but I only eat for health (mental and physical) and no foods are labeled bad or good. This took me a while to reduce my anxiety around food but once I stopped controlling and restricting the “bad food” lost its power/me obsessing about it and needing to eat it all. Sorry this got so long rn, but in case any of this relates to you I thought I’d share. I also lose my appetite in depressed episodes and eat more carbs, but that’s bc my body isn’t getting enough calories so it’s obvi wanted higher cal/higher carb foods! So don’t hate on yourself and I really hope you find balance. It’s hard."
bipolar2,fjltmw4,t3_fdwops,1583454179.0,Legit would do anything to get the fuck out of my head sometimes or maybe most of the time. I just need a substitute brain some days lol
bipolar2,fjiiaj2,t1_fjic6w7,1583368243.0,"It’s so painful. I still get panic attacks when I feel a shift downward in mood, which still happens sometimes but not so drastic as before and they don’t last as long at all. It’s just miserable to be in that state. I’m sorry you’re going through it rn. Gotcha, suckssss how long it takes to adjust and see if stuff works. I’m on lamictal and Wellbutrin and took so much suffering to find the right mix, but the right mix is worth it."
bipolar2,fjibptm,t1_fjib59l,1583364233.0,"You’re so welcome. I’m just still shocked I finally have hope and am positive! It is beyond hard to feel like that can’t be achieved while in the depths of depression/mixed state. Especially when it’s been so long that you forget what stability/happiness feels like! The longer I go the more suicidal I get bc I just imagine life that way and/or that this hell just waits for me. You will not feel that way for the rest of your life and that’s a fact, so hold on to that. Also what helped a little was thinking of a time or multiple times that you felt immense joy in the past. While dark I couldn’t truly feel that joy BUT it brought me closer to that and reminded me that this kind of feeling still exists. Okay sorry I keep writing a novel, I’m done haha"
bipolar2,fjiawas,t3_fdf4yy,1583363753.0,"I asked myself that for the last 2 yrs and thought my “okay” was stable and the way I would always live (which was shit). Now I am actually stable with meds and I just feel like me, the real/old me. I get up and I don’t dread my day, I think of normal things and aren’t stuck with intrusive thoughts, I don’t lay awake at night afraid and having racing thoughts of suicide, I feel joy when I laugh and smile and I have a desire to live. 

Being kinda recently diagnosed I constantly question what was my real personality and what was hypomania. I now realize the stable me still has my true “spunk” and the parts of me that I love. 2 weeks ago was my first taste of stability and I was driving and realized I was thinking and looking at the world as ME fo real and I legit broke down and cried tears of joy and shock lol. I still cry out of appreciation for still being alive and having days that I enjoy again. You can get there and I hope you feel this soon. Much love."
bipolar2,fjep0hv,t3_fcvxaw,1583275876.0,"Yes. During my mixed states I have excruciating agitation! It makes me the most suicidal and I call it my “active misery” lol

I have a little speaker and I play music and put it in between me and a pillow so I hear and feel the vibration of the music. It is really calming. I’m an occupational therapist, so a similar method of therapy is used on children with sensory processing issues. 

I also stretch to try to relieve some stress in my body and it doesn’t take me too much motivation to get myself to do it. I stroke my arms in fetal position while I’m totally losing it to try to calm myself and I breakdown a lot and it’s nice to cry it out haha idk if that’s great coping but it happens anyway. I’m on Wellbutrin and lamictal now and FINALLY feel happiness after 2 yrs of hell. I hope things start turning around for you."
bipolar,fiuipm5,t3_f9q7k2,1582742153.0,It is a seemingly endless and excruciating pain without moments of relief. A loss of self and a loss of life.
