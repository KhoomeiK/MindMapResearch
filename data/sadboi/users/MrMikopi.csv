At one of the movies, when they were introducing Episode (the character), they use a cathedral scene for literally 1 second.

I liked it so much that i screenshot'd right away.

It turns out, that image was a recreation of an award winning photograph. Featuring Gloucester Cathedral.

Recreating whole photograph, for only one second. Amazing."

That does not mean that life is supposed to be like that. I can't just dream about something and expect the world to be like that and no one should think like that. That's a trap yo! 

Also, It's not that the life never gives us the dreams we see and experiences we want. They are still possible (yay). I just try not to expect them like life is supposed to give them. 

Dreams sure are very joyful though. I think of them as my brain is experiencing what it wants for a moment, before it returns to reality."
