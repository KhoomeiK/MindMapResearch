depression,fpvvnkr,t3_gf6llw,1588952657.0,"I was just going through this yesterday, every time I do reserve a day to be unapologetic for living I’m instantly feeling guilt by the next day and try and “make up” for lost time by doing more than I need to.... I truly hear you on this."
relationship_advice,fouzwbo,t3_g9b38t,1588093112.0,"My boyfriend does this, he has expressed to me early on in our relationship he has a “sleep kink” but he asked me for consent to indulge in it once and a while. I agreed, based on my openness to my partners wants and needs as well as a bonus that he can get release on nights that I’m just not in the mood. It sometimes turns into a fun midnight/early morning romp. This is just our agreement that we have openly talked through. It is 100% something you should bring up and talk about especially if it’s something you are not entirely comfortable with. I wish you the best of luck navigating through this together!"
ADHD,fobr4xw,t1_foa6ms8,1587662772.0,"Thank you so much for sharing and weighing in your thoughts and experiences. I am mostly definitely holding off on exploring or even considering the route of medication until a diagnosis can be 100% confirmed to which I understand at his age now is too young to determine without a reasonable doubt, and I will be cautious not to allow my fears direct or sway my input/choice when deciding what will ultimately work best for him. Would be more of a relief if and when we cross that bridge if my son is at an age where he can understand and express his own feelings about what help he has available for him.

In the mean time learning more about non medical frameworks that are beneficial for him (and of course any child) is exactly what I will applying into our lives. Suffering from my own mental illness does make it challenging to stay on top of those kinds of things and I can only hope I can stay true to the formula and structure so that he can have a stronger parental figure. I am ultimately feeling optimistic once these tools and resources have arrived here at home and we can get to work on learning together! Again thank you! 

:)"
ADHD,fo9n6rk,t1_fo9mb7w,1587624557.0,"I absolutely agree on this. when I finally openly discussed my son and his behaviour to our FF, he did say he was too young to know for sure and we will give him more time to see how he develops going into 3rd or 4th grade unless more “extreme” signs expose themselves, he 100% isn’t a supporter of putting anyone on medication unnecessarily. I am definitely far more interested in creating more structure at home and next time seeing our FD discuss possible therapies or programs to help regulate his emotions for now. Thank you for your comment :)"
depression,fn8rfxz,t3_fzz9ji,1586748322.0,"Grass isn’t always greener. I wasted my youth too, doing exactly what you hear other friends talk about doing. Filling a void with zero structure and no balance. I will admit out of the plenty of wild bs there were a few of those moments where I felt young wild and free and will carry those memories with me. As an adult my circle is small, my social skills suck now and at this point it’s the quality of moments I make with ppl I give a shit about not the quantity. There is a social niche anyone can get themselves involved and I know it’s easier said than done to get yourself to get out there, I swear no matter what stage you are in life you will be able to grasp opportunities that make you alive, go for it!!"

sex,fn16pqe,t3_fyhyl4,1586555880.0,"I can definitely relate. I want to be clear that I do actually want to know the women I meet and not solely base it on a hook up, wether or not we do making a friend is a positive outcome. I have been talking long term with a few girls and they are super awesome, to actually romantically and monogamously DATE a girl I’m that idiot who always gravitates to women who are crazy out of my league and I’m there like “hi I’m a scrub do you like me?” c’est la vie I guess. Pursuing any women sexually I always make the first move and convo dies so fast, I have tried to make plans to meet and it usually follows with a legit or not excuse to fall through. I always ponder the same thing and I’m left being like, damn this is what I do to men all the time, talk about karma xP it will work out sooner or later I’m sure. BE WARE THE UNICORN HUNTERS!"
BabyBumps,fmvahjp,t1_fmva2kv,1586410613.0,"I do track actually! Guess it’s why I’m so alarmed, I did read missing a period and having an odd ovulation is pretty common in most women’s lifetime, in some moments I chalked it up to age (28) lol. I had no idea docs could induce a menstrual cycle! Thank you for the info I truly appreciate it. I will post an update once I get a solid answer! :)"
