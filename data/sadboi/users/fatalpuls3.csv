accord,fpgfzh5,t3_gdc6x6,1588601942.0,"I just bought a 2019 Accord Sport 1.5t in white.  My first Honda ever.  Negotiating MSRP is a little rougher with Honda as they claim they dont need to do this due to their vehicles exceptional resale value especially the Accord.  I was able to get them to throw in the warranty thought for basically employee cost in order to get the monthly price where I wanted it.  From a first time Honda owner but 4 Toyota owner (corolla, 4runner truck, 4 runner suv and corolla hatchback currently) 

Honda  
\-Better tech per dollar value then Toyota, their Entune system in Toyota is trash  
\-Smaller 1.5t great power for daily, and mileage for me has been 40mpg average  
\-One thing I found was the body alignment and gap tolerances are way larger then Toyota. meaning that the body line gaps are larger and the alignment of panels, trunk, hood, doors and trim have larger acceptance values for not being aligned like Toyota. Toyota has an insane small tolerance for mis alignments and gaps  
\-The Civic and Accord could use a big better rear end styling, especially the Accord. Compared to out .19 white Toyota Corolla Hatchback, that thing has way more styling than the rear of the Accord and Civic.  
\-Driving the Accord really feels planted out of the box.  The CVT is a bit different than a normal automatic but once you are use to it. its a dream to drive.

Overall I feel and wife feels that Honda provides a much better value for the money inside and out with tech (reliability here is a big deal), interior and engine quality price/power/MPG"

They use to manifest in my breaking stuff, nowadays its manifested in me just walking away however its also manifested in me not enjoying gaming much which right now sucks

My anger issues elsewhere revolve around my kids 17 20 and 21 not taking responsibility for their own actions in which they need to complete, like getting a license, actually doing what they are told, giving a fuck about making something of themselves.  I dont do well with a 21 year old who things hes grown, acts like an ass, thinks he knows everything yet doesnt even have a permit.

Side Note: My son is the worst worst offender wit his anger. It fuels his entire self being, worth and loathing of himself all day everyday. he never ever leaves his room."
