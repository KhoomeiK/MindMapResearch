Conservative,foshc31,t1_forye9p,1588030718.0,"I honestly didn't think he would win orignally as a Dem, but even left-leaning media outlets were touting him for a while.  One podcast I listen to (The Daily by NYT) really prepped him up all the way up til the last couple of caucuses, when Biden started pulling ahead in the polls.  Before that, it really seemed that (surprisingly) Bernie would have a chance.

Once Biden took the lead, the left-leaning media ran with it and seemingly forgot Bernie.  They went blank on reporting him.  Even here on Reddit, where previously I would see (guestimating) 20 - 30 Bernie posts a day... Those all but disappeared and the focus went to Biden.  At that point I knew it was not possible for Bernie to win the nomination...

And THEN the left media started downplaying Joe's documented perversiveness.  ""The Daily"" should specifically be ashamed of themselves... They did an entire podcast episode (with a female guest reporter) to try and convince their viewers that the way Joe presents himself to women is just the type of polititian he is - handsy, touchy/feely, ""affectionate"" to his constituents.  In this episode, they went on to talk about how things he does, like rub shoulders, smell hair, etc. aren't considered sexual harrassment, which is a very serious accusation.  Things that in any regular office environment could hands-down be reported as sexual harrassment, because that's what it IS.

Anyways, to get back to your question, I hoped Bernie would win based on his grassroots movements, the left-wing media hyped it up, people (including myself) took the bait, and then the rug was pulled from under my feet.  Not surprised it happened though.  

Feel free to ask any other questions or let me know if I didn't answer yours well enough!"
Conservative,foruc9l,t1_forjirq,1588018654.0,"I wanted Bernie to win, but then Biden became the top candidate.  While not surprised by this, I remember when the ""creepy Joe"" videos started coming out, back when he was VP.  So when he became one of the top contenders for the DNC (him or Bernie), I thought for sure Bernie would win because Joe already had public dirt on him.  Seemingly everyone has forgotten about how creepy he is to young girls and women, and his new sexual assault accusation is being completely downplayed by the dems (shame on you, New York Times).

I changed my party to Democrat to vote for Bernie.  I don't like Trump, but I sure as hell don't like Joe.  It is realy frustrating because I started trying to get into politics around the 2016 election; I ended up not voting because picking between Clinton and Trump was like trying to choose between the lesser of two evils (in my mind).

So  this year I switched to Democrat for Bernie only to have the same thing happen again, this time with Biden and Trump.

For what it's worth, I grew up in a conservative home, and I'm totally open to voting either Rep or Dem.  However, it's important to me to vote for someone who has honesty and stability in their policies.  When it comes to policies, I'd rather vote for the person who won't change their stance on issues, even if it's something I don't 100% agree to; at least I know I'm not being lied to just to get a nomination.  

If the Republicans can come up with a more honest (and intelligent) candidate, I'd be likely to change my voting party again.  But I don't see that happening in the foreseeable future (honestly not sure I'll see it on the Dem side either at this point now that Bernie's out).  Our political system these days is depressing."

You know, what pisses me off is that a 65 year old who gets isn't planning to live another 65 years realistically... But kids can have that expectation.  So what if testing is limited?  Kids with the symptoms should be tested so that if things happen to worsen they can be treated as best as possible quickly without additional hoops to jump through.  Older people who already have respiratory issues and celebrities/athletes/elites seem to be the only ones who seem to meet those requirements right now.

My dad's a casual smoker.  I asked him the other day if he'd stopped because, you know, now would be a great time to do that.  He hasn't quit yet!  Because to him, he's in ""otherwise great health"" for his age.  So when the virus hits him (and based on numbers I've read, there's a 40-70% chance of that) and he gets very sick, he's going to have a better chance of testing based on the criteria than my 6yo and my baby I mentioned in my original comment, who is less than 1.

So I called the advice line for our insurance and was scheduled a call with a doctor later. I talked to the doc who basically told me it was probably just flu and that due to limited testing (and the fact there are no ""confirmed"" cases at her school), we won't qualify for testing.

Her coughing has died down today, so I'm sure she'll be fine, and I would have raised hell with the doc if I thought she was in serious danger.  But it's ridiculous that there's not enough tests for gen pop who are actually showing some symptoms."

The ER repeated all the same breathing tests and his rate was back to normal by the time we got down there, so they sent us on our way after just sitting in a room for a couple of hours waiting for results...

It ended up being a $1300 trip to the doctor/ER, and he would have been fine if I kept him home (but of course I'm not risking his health, so I took him in).

In addition, our monthly premiums went up by $400/month because we had to switch to my spouse's plan which makes dependents pay 100% of the monthly premiums. If his company didn't offer health insurance, we could purchase from the marketplace and get the tax credits, which would make out monthly payments about $700-800 less than what we pay per month now.
