boyslove,fqbc567,t3_ghu45a,1589234289.0,"I finished it a few days ago and after watching some videos on it I think I'm in the minority of feelings towards the characters. The whole time I wanted Bum to get out. I never once felt like they could work things out or Sangwoo could change. I saw a lot of people hoping that Sangwoo would have a change of heart or something and stop being a killer and live happily with Bum but that is honestly never in the fucking cards lmao. I guess it just hit a little too close to home with me because I've been in abusive relationships (not nearly as seriously abusive as Sangwoo) and they don't change. Abusers rarely ever change especially in a relationship that they've been in for some time. It's kinda like training a pet, if you let them get away with the abuse there really isn't any reason for them to stop.

I do have sympathy for Sangwoo because he did grow up in an abusive family but so did Bum and he's not a serial killer. It's an interesting look at how people develop when they come from abusive upbringings, how polar opposite they can be. They both need therapy and psychiatric care. But I was 100% rooting for Bum to run and be happy with someone who doesn't abuse him because he deserves that so much.

I want to add too that I'm very disappointed in the way Sungbae handled Bum. It's like he's never heard of Stockholm syndrome. And it also seemed like it never occurred to him that the abuser would force the hostage to commit crimes so as to keep them quiet to police. That's pretty standard abuser tactics and this experienced detective from the big city didn't think about that?"

schizophrenia,fpf0rsh,t1_fpezi0f,1588559136.0,"I've done yoga some years ago and it did make me feel like I was doing something good for my body, but like I said in another comment it didn't stop my symptoms and I would really like it for people to stop pretending like it does. For example, my bf had a friend come to him saying he thought he was experiencing depression. He said he works out all the time and is still feeling like he's depressed. He had this idea that the magic cure all was exercise and was so against going on medication or even going to therapy because he thought exercise was gonna be the thing that did it for him. And it didn't. There's this attitude of ""you don't need *therapy,* you don't need *medication.* All you need is to go take a walk, or meditate, or do yoga, have you tried mindfulness?"" I'm sick of it. Because it turns people away from getting professional help that they need. 

And about making my own posts, I definitely do that. I make posts mostly on tumblr and here on reddit, I'm never on instagram, I was looking at the hashtags on a website that tracks the most popular tags. Also to add, I think this post complaining about it would also serve the same purpose. If someone comes to this sub confused about what they're experiencing they may see this post essentially telling them ""yoga is not a cure all, get help"" and they may heed the advice.

* I tried planting a sapling in sand, it grew to it's full size. Funny though, you can't transplant a tree that has grown past stage 1 into sand *on the beach* but you can transplant it into sand paths.
* placing stone/brick paths in all 8 blocks around the tree does not stunt it's growth
* placing fencing around it doesn't work
* placing furniture in all 8 blocks around it doesn't work
* planting another sapling next to it only stunts the growth of the sapling but the other tree will continue to grow through the stages
* planting 8 saplings around it only stunts the growth of the saplings
* you cannot transplant a stage 2 or higher tree next to other trees, stumps, rivers, cliffs, buildings, rocks
* you cannot transplant fully grown trees next to trees stage 2 or higher

I only used saplings in this experiment and not planted fruits so maybe that's something else to mess around with but honestly I'm not that hopeful for it. I'll test it out with what others are saying about having too many trees in that acre."
