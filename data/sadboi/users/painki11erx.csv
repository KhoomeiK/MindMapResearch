How about the fact that u and everyone else in the fucking world got Jesus killed? Now that, that is despicable.   


Don't ever try and put yourself above the rest of the world u effing idiot. Be grateful that god is willing to overlook the things u did that got his son killed, and then hope he is gracious enough to extend that same grace to the people you call ""despicable"", because they need it too.  


Btw, I hope u don't call yourself a christian, cause you're not a very good representative for god. People like u are the reason people like me no longer want to be associated with christians.  


I wouldn't normally care that you drive people from god instead of the opposite, because even though I know I ""need"" him, I'm still convinced I'm a waste of his grace and I don't care what happens to me. But I care about other people like me, they do need god and I'll be damned if someone like u is going to stand in their way. I would go to hell myself if it saved some people like me and I'm not even a christian. Would u though, or is your soul the only one that matters?"

I was never able to actually achieve my end goal after being awake for over 70 hours straight, but in the research I found that was usually the point where one would start having hallucinations.

Some people need more sleep than others, so if u haven't been sleeping much that would be my best guess.

I had also come across some things about people hearing loud bangs that sounded like they were in the room but actually was a sound inside their head. Don't know if that's what u meant by the hearing part of it, but I would maybe do some research on what your experiencing as it isnt terribly uncommon to hear sounds and have hallucinations when you're tired."

And it only makes it worse because everyone ignored me when I told them I was suicidal, it's like since they know I won't kms they don't care that I'm still seriously contemplating it.

I've been out of a job for nearly a year now and I'm always telling everyone that I'm just a burden and a cause of stress, but they say otherwise, however despite that they still ignore that I'm suicidal, they just want me to snap out of it and act like everyone else who's normal.
I guess I'll just wait till I'm kicked out lol if I can't get better on my own like they want they'll get fed up with me eventually.

I don't know if I have anything to say about anything getting better, cause I'm scared I'm forever fucked in this world myself.
I guess just know others are out there like us, it's nice to know some times that someone else is in the same thing trying to hold on.
I sometimes wonder if maybe we're the ones who have the right idea and everyone else is insane for wanting to live in this world lol"

Besides church isn't usually something a suicidal person wants to deal with.

You may not have had anyone who understood enough to help u, but would it be worth it to carry on for the sake of potentially helping someone you care about who may need your help.

SuicideWatch,ewou5n3,t3_cp7tlk,1565626743.0,"It sucks man. 
There's been a few times I've tried to talk to my mom about wanting to commit suicide. She knows I'm suicidal so when I want to talk she realizes that's what I'll talk about.
But it's so hard for me to get the courage to say something that she'll eventually say ""I can't sit here till 1am waiting for you to talk, I'm tired so just spit it out.""

This makes it hard for me to believe people when they say they care, cause I hold people to my own standards of what it means to care about someone. 
If you're someone I care about and your suicidal and need to talk but have trouble building up the courage, I will literally sit there for 3 freaking days without sleep until you're ready to talk. If that's what it takes to show I care about someone I'm willing to go that far.
If I have a job and they need me, I'd walk out even if it meant getting fired. People I care about I place above everything else. I wouldn't be able to live with myself if a friend asked for help and I said I was busy with work, only to find that they killed themselves or even attempted to the next day.

Maybe that's why I'm actually suicidal, because everyone I know would make sure everything stays perfect in their life before they can consider sparing any time for me.
So why bother living in a world where their success comes before my life?
Maybe its unrealistic of me to hold other people to my standards, but just saying the words ""I care about you"" feel quite void of meaning if your actions say otherwise."
