I feel as though some women on this sub are NOT in touch with their feelings and as a result pounce on people who are. News flash! Everyone has feelings. And some of us(myself included) are trying to actively work through those feelings to develop a positive and productive way to create boundaries. I have learned A LOT from this sub, and I actively try to implement some of it into my life, but I don‚Äôt value women on here being on their high horse looking down on other women. They are just as bad as a LVM in my opinion. They are doing very similar behaviors, and it‚Äôs ok?! Humans are humans, and shitty people are shitty people. I am sick and tired of seeing the negativity on here. Jesus Christ support one another! Otherwise you are NOT a HVW. 

Welcome to my fucking boundaries. I will absolutely NOT let you cross them."
FemaleDatingStrategy,fq0ocen,t3_gfwol0,1589035077.0,"I 100% agree with you! Honestly I really like what this sub stands for and I have learned a lot
From the handbook, but a while back I
Made a post on what I was going through and a few women on here tore me to shreds. I felt completely belittled, disregarded, devalued and misunderstood. I wasn‚Äôt asking to hear how I messed up (I was well aware). I wanted to hear feedback from women who could give me genuine advice on the situation and how to handle things going forward. I‚Äôm a big girl, I don‚Äôt need my hand to be held or people to sugar coat things. But I felt completely disrespected by some of the comments I received. I even got the title ‚Äúpickmeeisha‚Äù which I kind of found very triggering and insulting, to be honest. I came out of several bad relationships, and decided to take a deep look inside myself to try and figure out why I seem to be attracting toxic behavior. I am actively working on making myself a better woman. I am creating boundaries, and not letting men pass them (like I used too). I am standing up for myself. So the fact that the mods labeled me as pickmeisha actually felt like I was being set back, because I KNOW that isn‚Äôt me anymore. That being said I think someone who actively complains about how things suck, and doesn‚Äôt do a thing to change it, should be labeled a pickemeisha because they are NOT trying to make their situation better! But I feel as though some women on this sub who jump to conclusions too quickly. Because your right, no one knows what these women have gone through. They might be like me where maybe they fell back into a bad habit and want REAL FUCKING advice on how to not let it happen again!

I think this sub is great and I appreciate the women on here who genuinely are here to empower women, and letting them know their faults but also while VALIDATING their feelings! I don‚Äôt care who you are but we have all feel shitty at one point EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US, and it would be nice to have a group of women who want nothing more than to make the world wide female community a positive one.

DO NOT TEAR WOMEN DOWN FOR MAKING MISTAKES.

That is a HVW."
