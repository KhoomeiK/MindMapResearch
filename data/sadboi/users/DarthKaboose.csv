WritersGroup,fnn2q38,t1_fnmzoqd,1587083152.0,"This is excellent advice. I am learning in the process of this book that writing is subjective, but as you say, there are definitely universal elements.

WritersGroup,fnmn26n,t1_fnlqv9n,1587074405.0,"Awesome thank you so much. In my earlier drafts I definitely kept the prose simple and had feedback that I was telling instead of showing, so perhaps another case where I’ve executed it wrongly and need to find a better balance.
The woman is being burned as they are in a cult, very paranoid, and they believe her to be a spy. What I’m taking from your feedback, is that it’s more important to establish these sorts of things than use a punchy opening and leave it until later.

When I was pregnant with my first child, I had a close friend of my mother in law (turned out to be a total loon, what a surprise) fill my head with all sorts of anti-vaxx crap. I have awful health anxiety already and she had me genuinely believe that the moment the needle went in my baby would have seizures and die, she linked me all sorts of ‘studies’ and I was so terrified of them.

Thankfully, after discussing it with other people around me, I realised she was full of crap. I was so scared the night before his vaccinations that I wouldn’t have a child in 24 hours time. What happened? He had a bit of a cry at the surprise of the needle, within about 20 seconds he had calmed down, was feeding nicely, didn’t get so much as a temperature. He’s 4 years old now and absolutely thriving and I can rest safe knowing he’s got the best chance of protection against preventable diseases.

If I hadn’t had the support network of people around me to give me the true facts, I could have fallen into the fear trap, for sure. I think it’s important we continue to speak out, to share resources and yeah, even memes and things because it just might nudge someone to look into it further and do right by their child (and everyone else in this world!)

Edit to add: I also spoke with the nurse at the first appointment about my fears. She was not all ‘big pharma pushing vaccines’ as the anti-vaxx lady had said, she told me it’s totally normal to be worried and question big decisions as a new parent, She laid out the facts and answered all my questions honestly and it was completely reassuring. She was great"

WritersGroup,ffxm9z8,t3_evo93r,1580328008.0,"Hello!

First of all, you can definitely write. I really encourage you to keep at it. 

The concept is awesome and you have a clear voice and style that definitely suits what we know about the concept from what you've given us so far. 

I would encourage you to focus on showing instead of telling, which I know can be overheard and a bit of an eye-roll, and the premise of an introduction is often a fair amount of exposition anyway so you get a bit of a pass here. 

I never truly understood the show-don't-tell thing and then one day it sort of clicked for me. If you can take some of the exposition here and re-frame it into action, it will be more engaging. 

Play around with it, see if there are any situations that could benefit from this and you'll naturally find a balance that's right for you and right for that point of the story

Keep at it, I think this has great potential and I would definitely read the full story!"

WritingPrompts,etwbuo0,t3_cd5x57,1563262441.0,"Hubert Bimble, of Bimble Motors, raced through the crowds of people as quickly as his stout legs would carry him. Droplets of sweat began to swell on his face, flushed from the exertion, and would then run trails into his thick moustache. His thin spectacles edged their way precariously down his nose. His round tum rose and fell with each huff and puff, the green buttons of his shirt stretching to near tearing point and then back again. He paused on the street corner and raised his wrist to glance at his watch. He was only a few minutes late, but this was not a meeting he wished to be late for, and so he took off again, less hesitant to give a slight push towards the sea of pedestrians in his way. At any other time he would have quite liked to stroll through the streets of New York, and perhaps he would have stopped at a few notable buildings or grabbed a hotdog from the street stall, but this meeting was not one to be late to. And Hubert Bimble was notoriously late to meetings.

A few more minutes passed with a few more huffs and puffs, and just as he began to think he would never find it, he found it. His bulging eyes widened at the nondescript staircase, grey concrete with a railing of steel, tucked between a kebab shop and a costume hire. Hubert Bimble looked left, then he looked right, as if expecting somebody to jump forward and offer a sign of confirmation. When none came, and with a slightly raised brow, he began up the stairs, grumbling quietly all the while. The letter had arrived at his London office just two days prior, the dark green ink bearing a sheen that made it look still wet. The ticket for the flight had been enclosed, and had it been marked from any other recipient, he would have thought it a malicious trap, or a rather expensive joke. He felt a quiver of anticipation as his porky hand reached out to push the blue door at the top, and he stepped into a dark meeting room.

The carpet was dark and tattered, exposing the floorboards beneath in some places. Two dingy lamps hung from the ceiling, illuminating the room in a foul yellow glow but leaving the deep corners untouched. Ten or twenty school desks were pushed together in the centre of the room to create one large table, surrounded by plastic chairs. A group of people sat on these chairs and chatted quietly amongst themselves, most with a tumbler of drink before them and even the odd ham sandwich. A woman with a hooked nose and a dark fringe was speaking to a lanky man beginning to bald, while a group of three men wearing what looked like cotton dressing gowns passed foreign coins between them. Hubert Bimble cleared his throat, quietly at first and then louder, causing the room to fall silent and the strange faces to turn in his direction.

“Hello,” he began, “My name is Hubert Bimble and I am here for the… ah, the meeting.”  
The room stayed silent. One woman with tight blonde curls puffed on a crimson cigarette holder almost as long as her arm. Another gulped back her drink in its entirety.  
“I must have the wrong venue. I’ll just be on my way.”  
“No need.”  
The voice came from the shadows and a man stepped forward. He reminded Hubert of Count Dracula, with a willow’s peak and high collar, but his face was tanned and cheerful and he was chewing on a triangle of sandwich.   
“You are here for the illuminati meeting, correct?”  
“Yes,” Hubert stammered, “But that cannot be…?”  
“Great, we can get started. Take a seat.”  
Hubert plunked his bottom onto the nearest seat, feeling absolutely flabbergasted. His moustache twitched as he reached into his blazer pocket and retrieved a handkerchief. He wiped his brow and cleared his throat.   
“Welcome,” the man grinned, “I am honoured to be in your company once more, dear friends. And let us give a warm welcome to our newest member, Hubert Bimble of Bimble Motors.”  
 The room applauded politely. The smoking woman winked at Hubert, causing his cheeks to redden once more.  
“Hubert, you must have many questions.”  
“Yes, well, yes. I… Is this some sort of joke?”   
“Not at all, Hubert!” The man appeared deeply offended.   
“Who on earth are you?”  
“I am Alistor Trawbeck, of Trawbeck and Trawbeck Law.”  
“Trawbeck and Trawbeck? And you are, well, you’re a part of this?”  
“Watch how you speak to mister Trawbeck,” warned the lady with the hooked nose. “He don’t take kindly to disrespect.”  
“Now, now, Petula, it’s quite alright,” Alistor smiled.   
“Petula?” Hubert sputtered.   
“Correct, Hubert. Petula here founded her department store just a few years ago.”  
“They reckon I’ll be too big for ‘em in another few, but I like to be here while I can.”  
“Will somebody please tell me what is going on?” Hubert shouted. He stood, furious, his meaty hands pressed onto the desk in front of him. His breath was coming on heavy again and he mopped his brow once more.   
“People think we are all powerful. All wealthy. Correct?” Alistor asked.  
Hubert nodded. Alistor smiled, satisfied, and paced the length of the room as he spoke. The group of three men began to murmur and exchange coins once more.  
“The illuminati was founded many, many years ago. We are not powerful, at least not in the way you might expect. We are not wealthy. The wealthy are not allowed to stay with us. Well, in a sense.”  
“No Rothschilds?” Hubert asked suspiciously.  
“Not a single one. We are but a group, a union if you will, of small business owners picked at random from throughout the world. Clara here is in charge of data,” the blonde Clara gave another wink at this, “and a member is picked at random each time one of us leaves.”  
“We can leave?” Hubert asked hopefully.  
A few laughs rang throughout the room.  
“The capital earnings of our members must be below a certain threshold. If it exceeds this threshold you must leave. If you fall out of business you must leave. Clara handles the figures. Otherwise, you are bound to the union.”  
“And if I refuse?”  
“There is no refusing.”  
Hubert nodded slowly.   
“And what do we, ah, do?”  
“We represent the working class. We are the ambassadors of the common people. We meet annually, though we send email reports biweekly, and between us we control each of the business sectors in the world. We influence politicians, and write the laws. We control inflation and taxes. We set the stage for all.”  
“Then what the ruddy hell are you people doing? We have problems abound!”  
“Well of course we do.”

Alistor was leaning back against the table behind him, casually chewing on his third ham triangle of the evening. Most in the group had begun to talk quietly amongst themselves. Hubert noticed, for the first time, that Clara was transcribing the meeting, scribbling furiously onto a napkin. One person surreptitiously muttered ‘I wish they still used the introductory video’. Hubert Bimble was seated again now, resigned to the oddity of this place and these people, half hoping he would wake up soon from this queer nightmare. It was Alistor’s next sentence that caused him to faint, plonking onto the floor with a thud.  
“If we let the economy flourish too finely, the galaxy overlords would execute us, of course.”"
