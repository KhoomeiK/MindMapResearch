AskReddit,fi5m0gf,t1_fi2bqrd,1582165951.0,"They're not therapists, though- they have *wildly* less training than a therapist. Not everyone who volunteers at a hotline is a saint, but plenty are just trying to help.

As a person who has been involved in the kink scene for forever and who has moved through the world being seen as female... there is a marked difference between someone just trying to feel heard and someone using you to get off by making you feel uncomfortable. Using someone's position as a femme-seeming service worker- whether that is a paid position in retail or a volunteer position as a hotline worker- to corner them into listening to your wank session is, actually, a wildly popular pass time, and it fucking sucks. I have watched kink scenes so weird and niche and perverted that they defy description with no problem and still been very distressed by a male customer's recounting of relatively vanilla sex shit in manipulated circumstances like this- it's about consent and intention as much or more than it is about content. Trust that those who move through the world as women have been the target of enough of this to, by and large, know the difference.

Are there women working as hotline volunteers who may have misconstrued a call from a depressed kinkster needing an ear? Probably. But I will bet you dollars to donuts that that number is overwhelmingly dwarfed by the number that have dealt with shitty people with bad consent practices taking up valuable hotline time."

I generally don't go in when there are too many dogs, or when the one or two dogs that seem to make her extra anxious are there, but she really does love being there when the numbers are right and I would be sad to have to keep her out forever. The barking happens whenever she's running and playing, even in one-on-one playdates, so I'm hoping that your idea helps get her to the point where we can go back to the park during slower times and not be a nuisance to everyone else!"

SuicideWatch,fe6oic9,t3_enq58n,1578898206.0,"Echoing what others are saying- molly and booze is a combination that will have seriously fucked with your ability to consent. Molly lowers your inhibitions really hard, especially around sex and touch and feelings. I have done a \*lot\* of psychedelic drugs over a lot of years, and still, with molly (and acid) specifically, I was vulnerable to emotional manipulation and control from an (now-ex) partner. 

You tried to assert your boundaries under duress and while super intoxicated- that is brave and hard, and I'm really fucking sorry this person didn't listen. Does your girlfriend know about the circumstances at play here? The coercion, the pressuring, the ignoring of your ""no?"" If my partner told me that story, I would understand. 

Even leaving the intoxication aside- I have absolutely done exactly this thing, protested and said no before going along with things- even taking active part in things- because, when it's clear that the other person isn't listening to you, it's just much, much easier to just let it happen. In some ways, those interactions stuck with me more than some of my more intense sexual trauma incidents, specifically because, well... I participated. I acquiesced. That gets into your psyche in a really fucked up way.

It's still assault. It is still 100% on the other person's head, for not listening to you. For crossing your boundaries and disregarding your personhood.

I can't promise that anyone's feelings will change in any particular direction- but give her all the information and a little time, and she might come to understand a bit better what your situation is. In the meantime, do you live somewhere where there is good, healthy queer community? If you can find people who understand consent, and who might even understand that sexuality is fluid (i.e. your passing curiosity about fucking a dude does not mean you're not gay), that could be really supportive.

I can super relate to drinking to alleviate dysphoria- These days, I'm drinking to alleviate physical pain and to dull the depressive emotional agony/body image dysmorphia issues, but dysphoria used to be top of the list.

I will say- one of the few things that helps counteract everything, depression and anxiety and body image issues and disability angst, is gender affirming action. Taking my T shot; making my hair do something that feels right; packing in public; grooming my body hair the way that I want; putting on that one piece of clothing that feels like ME. It sounds like your friends and family love you- are you out to them? Can they support you in pursuing dysphoria-reducing things? Hormones are fucking magical, lemme tell ya, and will only be moreso the younger you are (there are multiple major hormonal shifts that happen before 30, not just the big one as a teen, and boy do I wish I had gotten on T before especially this last one that hit me at 28).

I'm close with some parents of children who committed suicide as teenagers/in their early 20s and it is so gut wrenching, what they went through. My parents are in their 70s and I won't bring that kind of anguish into the last decades of their lives.

Also suffered repeated molestation when I was small by a slightly older male child, almost immediately began integrating fantasies about being dominated/attacked into my traumatized prepubescent sexuality. Still have significant fantasies around being raped, usually violently and usually as a woman. Dysmorphia city!

I got into sex work in my early 20s partially as a way to express some female part of me that wanted to be put into dangerous situations with shitty cis dudes. I stopped, but was able to engage in this CNC type BDSM play joyfully and fully in some subsequent relationships, the last and most impactful of which turned out to be with someone who was using my transness to work out their own gender issues. Being an unwilling (unaware!), unpaid, untrained, traumatized gender therapist with complicated BDSM dynamics and bad poly thrown in basically broke me all over again.

My ability to engage with those violent fantasies without immediately feeling awful about it has taken a sharp downturn over the lay three years since that relationship. I've also basically lost my ability to be sexual at all since that breakup, but aggressive cishet gang rape fantasies are all I can jerk off to on the rare occasions that I do feel any kind of sexy.
