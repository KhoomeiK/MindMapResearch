“ I hate you, I hate you, I do; I hate that you’re the one that can make me… With just a flick of your finger, it is that easy.“

“ Down in Mexico, something about the open road, I knew that he was looking for some Indian blood and, find a little in you, find a little in me, we… we’re just imposters in this country you know.”
