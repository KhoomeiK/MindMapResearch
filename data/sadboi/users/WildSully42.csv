Dak, they're young quarterback is having an MVP season until he goes down with a season-ending injury late in the year.  Andy Dalton, the seasoned veteran with flashes of brilliance in the past, steps up to the plate, carrying his team through the playoffs and to a superbowl victory.  He earns himself a superbowl MVP.  They eventually build a statue of Andy Dalton outside of AT&T Stadium.  They keep Dalton for another year and he wins another playoff game for them.  But this time, his contract is up, and if they sign Dalton again to another high-value deal, they worry they will lose the trust of their hotshot, MVP-would-be quarterback Dak Prescott, so they let Dalton walk.  He joins the Tennessee Titans who have been struggling with less-than-stellar play from Ryan Tannehill.  Dalton busts in Tennessee after getting hurt week one and loses his starting job to some late-round quarterback with strong facial hair game and a unique fashion sense.  The only thing left for the Titans to do is trade him to the Packers because their first-round pick quarterback who they traded up for, Jordan Love, ends up being a letdown who doesn't earn his fifth-year option.

OverwatchUniversity,foeuk8y,t3_g6q7xp,1587715255.0,"I've always liked the idea of a character who can toss a freeze trap on the ground like Junkrat's steel trap.  When an enemy steps on it, they get cryo-froze like Mei's self-heal ability, but they don't get healed, can't cancel it, and are basically locked in place for 2-4 seconds of the fight, but cannot take damage while frozen.

Maybe Symmetra-like turrets that instead of dealing damage, heal your teammates.

An ult that is cast like Sombra's ult, but is sleep dust instead of EMP waves.  Shields block it.  Any character hit by it is slept for 5 seconds, but is woken if they take damage.

A support who can place mini health packs on the map.  People thought this might be an ability for Baptiste when he was revealed.

Sludge that can be sprayed like Torb's ult, but just slows the enemies.  Maybe it can have an inverse effect too, simliar to Ana's grenades, where it speeds up your allies.

A sort of lasso or butterfly net that can trap or slow an enemy from a range.  Would not bring the target toward the user like Hog's hook though.

Vines or a ladder that can be put against walls to allow all teammates to wallclimb up a wall.  I imagine this for a sort of botanist-type scientist character who also has the aforementioned sleep dust ult.

A tank ability that is similar to deflect or Sigma succ, but after the use is over, all the damage can be converted into a thrown projectile with a determined percentage of the damage absorbed being dealt.

A flamethrower as a primary weapon that has slightly similar range to Zarya's beam, but has a burn effect after the flames are not aimed at the target anymore.  Am ability of this character could be to self destruct his heat tank, doing slight damage to himself and any enemy near him.  It might disable his primary for a couple seconds, but when it comes back, it is stronger or the range is better.  If the idea of a self-damaging ability is disliked, maybe it could instead be a passive that happens every time the hero reloads, and doesn't damage them at all, but still damages nearby enemies."

Sam Darnold has a higher floor than Josh Allen, but also a lower ceiling, based on what I've seen.  He probably won't lose you the game, but I don't see him rallying his team to major comebacks or leading the charge in a huge way with a 4+ touchdown game.  He is the 2018 version of Marcus Mariota.

His hook will bring the bastions out of position so they don't get in turret form.  If he hooks a tank bastion, he can shoot it once and heal and tank the rest of the shots while his team finishes it.  Very helpful for dealing with the bastions in the final phase where they are set up on the ledges because hooking them will force them to go all the way around back to high ground.  While he does this, deal with the Orisa(s) and little guys, and if he gets set up again, hook him again.  My favorite healer was Brig, which seems counterintuitive given her short range and low damage, but her armor and ult are so helpful and forgive mistakes easily.  Plus, with the low health pools, inspire is more than enough to keep everyone topped off, and armor packs can be used to give heals to a far away target.  Anothe or tank for a shield never hurts, preferably Rein or Sig, and then a torb turret is helpful too.  Idk why, but Torb's turret gets full health as opposed to the reduced health all the characters and shields get, so that's nice."
