EatingDisorders,fpzwk3g,t3_ggd3kb,1589024750.0,"We can’t definitively tell you yes or no, because we’re on the internet. However it sounds like disordered eating to me, meaning that there are some symptoms of eating disorders. For example the preoccupation with “junk” food and the loss of control you mentioned around junk food, and the way you said you binge those foods and then feel terrible about yourself.


Interestingly, you said your dad does the same thing. Consider that maybe he also has some unhealthy behaviors around eating. Here’s an article about genetics and disordered eating: https://www.eatingdisorderhope.com/blog/genetic-factors-eating-disorders


Ultimately, if this concerns you and affects your quality of life in any way (such as your mental well-being, receiving adequate nutrition, ability to socialize, etc) then it might be a good idea to find a therapist with experience treating disordered eating and talk it out with them."

https://www.verywellmind.com/delayed-onset-ptsd-meaning-and-reasons-2797636

It is blatantly obvious to me now that my parents should never have had a child, due to their terrible genetics and unresolved personal traumas and mental illnesses. I mean, shit. Everything in every parenting blog or manual I read just screams that my parents fucked it up, big time. And I ended up parenting my sister way more than either of my parents did, and I did a better job than them as a child.

I don’t get why parents feel the need to make everyone care about their kids. It’s like once some people breed they have difficulty with “theory of mind” - understanding that other people think and feel differently than they do about parenthood and children. Like no, no one wants to see your child’s shit or potty training or whatever. No."

slp,fob1sob,t1_fob0jh8,1587655138.0,"Thank you for the clarification. I couldn’t tell you for sure if grad school was a trauma for you, that will have to be something you and your therapist determine together. But here’s some insight I’ve gained while in therapy for PTSD- my mind brings forward memories and feelings when I am safe and ready to handle them. Maybe you finishing your masters degree meant that your mind felt it was the right time to bring some things to the surface, if that makes sense. Grad school is a major stressor and I’ve found that I tend to bury things to get through that type of stressor. 

Hope I didn’t overstep, I don’t mean to assume things about you OP. Please feel free to message me any time as you’re working through all this."
slp,fo7my23,t3_g5yttn,1587581083.0,"I am a person who has been diagnosed with PTSD by medical professionals from a traumatic event and traumatic childhood. I am also an SLP who has completed grad school. 
From my perspective people tend to use “PTSD” lightly whenever they actually mean that they are having anxiety, dread, stress related to their education. I’m not saying this is what you’re doing, but I want to know what in particular you mean by this. 
Did you and your cohort experience a specific trauma or traumas in grad school? Or do you mean that collectively you all experienced significant stress and now you all feel burnt out, exhausted, residual anxiety and/or depression? I just want to identify the distinction.

I imagine Peeta trying for a more pacifist angle as you mentioned, but the Capitol would wield Katniss as their weapon. I don’t think they’d execute her, they’re too aware that she’d become their martyr. I think they’d take her archery skill and use Tracker Jacker venom to make her an assassin taking down key people who are Rebels, publicizing each of her kills so the people can begin to hate her. And better yet if she dies trying to assassinate a Rebel leader, she’s gone and also cannot be martyred. 

Peeta would be unable to go forward with his propos as the public vision of the Rebels knowing that each of his choices would cause Katniss to be tortured or forced to murder someone (additionally putting her at risk of being killed by the Rebels in retaliation). He’d want to go see President Snow himself for a peace meeting to do his utmost to persuade him to release Katniss or broker peace. Which obviously wouldn’t turn out well, probably Peeta would die.
