They have listening and speaking exercises as well. Depending on the level of your lesson, you might translate on your own, whether in english or swedish, instead of the word suggestions. I can see why you'd want something more like a game though. I find it interesting enough on it's own though, but I can see that it wouldn't hold everyone's attention."

It's harder to hear it, even knowing every word, and then piece it together before they move on to the next sentence. Some stuff you'll know before others. Just keep studying and exposing yourself. I think duolingo does the best. It has some listening exercises that help with that. I'm betting it's easier to learn english from Swedish than it is to learn swedish from english. It's not too hard, especially once you get some of the concepts. Definitely not like trying to learn Chinese or Russian or something, some words are the same even. Just keep at it.
