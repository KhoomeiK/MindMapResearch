ShaneDawson,f6x43pu,t1_f6x1sbd,1573241492.0,"Are you purposely trying to misunderstand?

Money means less financial stress. If you have a lot of it, it means no financial stress. Imagine living a life where a huge car repair, surgery, or natural disaster don’t even cause you to bat an eye. 

Having a lot of money means freedom. You can go where you want. You don’t have to work if you don’t want to. If you do want to work, you can choose when and how and where you want to. 

You can do any of the legal things you want. If you do illegal things, you will not be prosecuted the same as a “regular” person. If you are convicted, you won’t serve a similar sentence as a “regular” person. 

Money means providing for friends and family and supporting causes you care about. You can literally change the fates of people around you. 

People do not love literal dollar bills. They don’t roll around and jerk off in bathtubs of quarters. They (arguably!) don’t love touching, counting, smelling money. 

People love the life that money can give them. If you don’t see that, then idk what’s going on. 

Obviously, money doesn’t fix all problems. Obviously, you can be unhappy and rich. You can be mentally ill and rich. You can be ill and rich. You can be abused and rich. 

But would you rather be a homeless, mentally ill person with cancer who is in a toxic relationship or a rich AF one? Pretty clear to me."

When I was a teenager, a stray cat birthed/brought two baby kittens on our front porch.  We brought them in and tried to care for them. Momma cat was really small to be a mom - looked very young herself. 

One of the babies died within the first few days. Its head was misshapen and had some birth defects. But the other one lived and we took them both to the vet. Kept the mom and got her spayed and was able to give the kitten to a family friend once it was around 8 weeks old. 

We regretted it so much. She (the mother cat) frantically looked for him for about two weeks. That’s the best way I can describe it. She roamed all around the house crying and searching. It was hard to watch.

BlackPeopleTwitter,eycgw1k,t3_cwe1z2,1567001754.0,"I know it’s not the same for all states, but I just wanted to put it out there in case you want to vote but feel like you can’t because of work. Your employer may be obligated to let you leave!

WV considers voting an important right for its citizens. All of my employers have been required to give a minimum 3 hour paid break for all employees to vote. And my current (and most generous) employer’s policy is that employees may take a half day off (with pay).

It may not apply to your state and, if it doesn’t, that sucks. I’m sorry. But if it does, then you should take advantage of it!"
shittingadvice,ey9c309,t1_ey9bln5,1566939912.0,"Anything high in fiber generally helps; so vegetables and fruits are good for your overall health but also your “bathroom heath.” 

Other than that, I’m not really sure, unfortunately. If you have IBS-C or chronic idiopathic constipation, then you most likely have trigger foods that make things worse for you.  You could try keeping a food diary and seeing which foods seem to make you more regular and which ones give the opposite effect."
shittingadvice,ey9b81l,t3_cw9io6,1566939352.0,"This is fine and more or less normal. This is most likely from an anal fissure or the beginnings of one. I’d recommend googling anal fissures if you want to know more about them. 

As a general rule of thumb, bright red blood is “good.” Dark red/black blood is bad and is a sign that you need to see your doctor ASAP. 

Now, about that “good.” It’s not good. Anal fissures happen when there’s trauma to the inner lining of your anus. If the trauma is caused by things coming out, then you should work on your diet, exercise, and perhaps take stool softeners. If the trauma is caused by things going in, then I would recommend more lube, slower build up, and communication. 

Obviously see a doctor if you are concerned for your immediate wellbeing."

It’s primarily used for cake decorating, but i add it to alcohol/drinks on special occasions. Kids (and adults) love it. 

The biggest question I get is - “Will my poop be sparkly?”  No. It won’t."

holdmyfries,ey5qymc,t1_ey4n6e6,1566838278.0,"Back in my subbing days, I did a semi-long term stint in a 5th grade position. So think 10-11 year old kids. 

The majority were overweight for their age/height, and there were a handful of kids who I would consider obese. While I wouldn’t call it normal, I would say that it’s common to find this many fat children in one place. 

I live in Appalachia/the rust belt. Obesity is pretty common here. But it is very unsettling to see so many kids starting their lives with eating habits that may take them to an early grave."
DotA2,exxwn6t,t3_cuqjyv,1566643841.0,"Learned not to boo even when tempted as a child. I thought everyone did. 

Is it possible they are being prompted on when to cheer/boo/silent? I haven’t been able to watch all of the games, but have heard some really strange crowd reactions. Ex: huge cheering and applause over seemingly nothing at weird times and crickets during exciting moments; now there is booing. 

Maybe I am dead wrong, but does anyone actually know if they are getting applause/cheer prompts?"

ShitpostXIV,exfswvv,t3_csi6au,1566247666.0,"I got put in jail, warned, and given a name change. 
My name was Hateful White Woman. 

I asked the GM what about my name was inappropriate. For instance, would I still be getting a warning if my name was “Angry tall man” or “cheerful black female” or “Enraged English Lad.”

Was it the use of gender? The implied race? The adjectives? The noun? 

He could not say what specifically about the name was inappropriate, but that any name that could be considered offensive is inappropriate."
