mentalillness,f2tuwpl,t3_de78jl,1570400839.0,"Sounds to me like you‚Äôre one of the good ones. You push to be the best you can. I‚Äôd say never settle for less. Me, I‚Äôm the opposite and it‚Äôs horrible. I know I can do better but I just gave up. My illness has destroyed me. Don‚Äôt fall into that trap... just keep doing what you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôll probably have an amazing productive life."
mentalillness,f28ibrm,t1_f28hewv,1570062322.0,"I hope everything goes well for you. And yes, there is only so much a person can take... occasionally I get reminded of that. Abandonment scares the hell out of me."
mentalillness,f28gwty,t3_dcitkx,1570061307.0,I am currently going through an episode. I feel like I have no purpose in life. I can‚Äôt hold a job and my disability claim was denied. My therapist and psychiatrist both agree I cannot work. I have a good wife who is not mentally ill. She understands my sickness but of course could never fully understand the magnitude of what I feel.
KINK,f1rheg2,t1_f1rgmwe,1569715696.0,Lol... well it is role play but I totally understand. I personally am not a fan of religion but I like to try new things. This just happens to one of those things that I personally find works for me. Have you tried being whipped with rope? I find that works well.
KINK,f1rfpi3,t3_d7da5n,1569715111.0,"I like to use  crucifixes. I usually make my sub confess their sins. If they lie to me, they‚Äôre in big trouble. If they confess their sins to me I dish out the proper punishment. This gets much more involved and is a major psychological role which goes on for a while."

mentalillness,f1evm40,t3_d8w9a3,1569431258.0,"The problem I have is I went through that period of time when I was able to do that. Now, nothing is hidden anymore. It‚Äôs at the point where I can barely function in society. I hate my illness and those around me hate it too, only they attach the sickness to me as a person so, the sickness IS me! I don‚Äôt think a day has gone by where I don‚Äôt feel or at least think of suicide. I wouldn‚Äôt wish this on my enemy."
