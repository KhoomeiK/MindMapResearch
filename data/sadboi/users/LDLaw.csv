I’ve realised now that I don’t need to be out all the time with large groups of people all the time to enjoy myself. Post COVID I want my interactions with people to be much more meaningful. 

Structuring the day has enormous benefits, from something as simple as arranging a list of meaningful podcasts to listen to when walking, to deciding on a meaningful film to watch in the evening. I won’t want to wake up anymore without knowing what the day brings. 

I have rearranged my flat so my desk is in a corner of the room where I can do more focused study, and actually cleaned my flat so it is more presentable. I’ll keep it that way. 

I’ve made a determined pledge to myself to avoid ‘dead zones’, hours that drain away spent on social media. It gives me little benefit and creates enormous FOMO. I don’t want to give a care anymore if I feel someone else is having a better time than me.

How can someone volunteer for the company but not provide a service?? Makes no sense and I can see a huge loophole here of people feeling guilted to help out (volunteer) whilst furloughed.

The Government guidance is clearer:

If your employee does volunteer work
A furloughed employee can take part in volunteer work, if it does not provide services to or generate revenue for, or on behalf of your organisation. Your organisation can agree to find furloughed employees new work or volunteering opportunities whilst on furlough if this is in line with public health guidance.

I remember a popular comment back at the turn of February that said at the rate of infection in China, doubling every day, it could infect all of the world’s population in 47 days. Well that has passed now and instead 0.06% of the world are recorded to be infected. I’m sure that would have reassured me back then if I’d known that would be the case.

With that in mind, you have to wonder how your future self will look back on you now and your worries a few months from now. Is what you are imagining now about a few months time going to match the reality?"
Anxiety,flkm6m6,t1_flklic9,1585243518.0,"Thanks for the news. What exactly does this mean?

For example, is it something like:

For every 80000 tests 30% positive on day 12: 24000 positive 
For every 90000 tests 27% positive on day 15: 24300 positive 

Overall even though more tests and more infections the infection rate is lower?"

I’ve heard it said the best thing to do is to structure your day before you go to bed, or first thing at the very crack of dawn. 

You seen what Benjamin Franklin did?
