Also being in a relationship is no easy life. You‚Äôre very lucky if you find someone who you genuinely click with, very lucky. I don‚Äôt think that many people are that lucky. Also relationships in media/books is always idealized. It‚Äôs hard to get your head around this when comparing your life to this though."

It‚Äôs the last real relationship I was in. It‚Äôs just so having an idea of what love is and it just not living up to it. If you feel like your giving more than your comfortable with pull out.

In my 40s now I‚Äôm still not completely committed to anything and still just want to run but in the end hide. I feel like I‚Äôve wasted my life being depressed and angry.
