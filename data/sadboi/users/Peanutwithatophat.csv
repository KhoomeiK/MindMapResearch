Homesteading,f6prls7,t3_dsi09x,1573062757.0,"I used to volunteer for a wildlife non profit that promoted the use of owls for pest control. It’s amazing when it works, but you gotta do your research before putting up a owl box. 

Make sure no one nearby is using rodenticides (which will kill whole families). The direction the hole is facing, the proximity to trees, the quality of the owl box (needs a sun roof and shouldn’t be plastic) are all factors in it being successful. You have to clean the owl box each year during the fall and do repairs/upkeep. 

Some times you put up a box and it won’t get occupied for years, or maybe never. Even in a place with owls already. 

Cats I don’t think make a difference but if there is a Great Horned Owl living in the area, Barn Owls (the ones you want for best rodent control) are less likely to move in. 

But when it works, owls show up in your box and have owlets and keep returning year after year, it’s very cool. They are magical. It’s really something special.

Psychonaut,f619uc0,t3_dq581k,1572636268.0,"On Halloween when I was 14. long ago, my boyfriend and I decided to take massive doses of shrooms for the first time. 

We ate them at a friends house and a group of us kids decided to start walking around the neighborhood and trick or treat. They started to kick in and we were just enjoying the craziness that is Halloween - the costumes and decorations and mischief. There were people out everywhere. We somehow got separated from the group we were with and decided to walk to my sisters house where it was safe, but that was in the next town over. We walked, but it felt like it took forever and we were getting more and more weird. We were having such a great time though. 

At one point we had to sit down and take a break, and we both saw a candy wrapper on the ground, it started moving and warping and we were laughing and pointing and exclaiming how crazy it was. A couple in their 20’s walked by rolled their eyes and were like “woah, those kids are really fucked up” and we just laughed and laughed. We were so happy. 

We somehow made it to my sisters place and at this point everything was moving and warping and melting. The walls, floor, ourselves. We were totally out of our minds, rolling on the floor, in awe of what was happening. We were just so elated, having the time of our lives. 

We were yelling and making tons of noise when I suddenly realized, what if my sister was at home? I got super paranoid that she was in the house somewhere, even though she was no where to be seen and she wouldn’t have cared if we were tripping. She did mushrooms too. It was a challenging part of the trip for sure, but my boyfriend helped me chill out. 

This made things get serious and my boyfriend and I started talking and had a heart to heat about our lives. We were both from broken fucked up families and were trying to process some things. He told me he loved me for the first time, and I told him back. We cuddled on the couch and started to come down. 

Early in the morning, by the time we were sober, my sister came home with her BF. I remember they were dressed as Sally and Jack from Nightmare Before Christmas. I was so relieved knowing they weren’t actually in the house. I told them we took mushrooms and they were jealous lol. We all hung out and watched a movie before crashing. 

I’ll never forget that night. My boyfriend and I were together for another year and had a very deep connection and serious relationship. My sister passed away a few years ago, but I wish I could talk to her about this night again. 

I’ve never had a trip like that since. They have never been that fun or happy since that time. But I’m so glad I had that experience."

microdosing,f5tdz4w,t3_dp6lp2,1572456484.0,"(30 something married female here) 

A year ago I weaned myself off high doses of antidepressants so I could microdose. The doctor recommended I do the taper in 1 months time, however If I did that, it would have been a complete failure. It took me half a year to go from full doses to zero. And it still sucked, but I did it. 

I also have experience with opiate withdrawals and have had benzo prescriptions. I even have done a taper off methadone. All these medications I’ve had to kick, have sucked but here is what I’ve learned:

Go super slow. Slower than you want to. 

Be determined and stubborn in seeing it through. 

Physical activity, eat healthy, drink lots of water.

Meditate. 

It makes a world of difference to have someone to be supportive and understanding and helpful. 

If you need outside help, get it.

After I got off of the meds, I stayed sober for a while just to get a baseline of what I really felt like without anything. I sunk into a deep depression and stopped talking to anyone. It was bad. I finally decided it was time to try to microdose. Literally an hour after I took my first dose I felt so much better. As I continued it just kept getting better and healing me. I did some Macro(larger) doses and although challenging, they were very helpful. Now, after months of MDing, I am only takin a dose every once in a while. I’m not “cured” of my mental health issues but I am so much better off now that I was before this journey.

I then did some macro doses and switched to doing a MD about once a week. Now I only take a MD when I feel I need it, a couple times a month maybe. 

It really helped me in sooo many ways. My depression, my PTSD, motivation, healing, etc. From the first MD it almost instantly lifted me out of a serious depressive state where I wasn’t talking to anyone or doing anything. Truly amazing. No side effects. Better than any antidepressant I’ve ever taken. 

That being said, it didn’t really help my anxiety. It was as if all the other bad stuff was lifted away (and that was incredible) but the anxiety was still hanging on.

I was able to do more things and be more social and work on myself which in turn was positive for my social anxiety. However, I still had the physical anxiety symptoms and negative thoughts surrounding being social. So I guess you could say it worked in some aspects but not others. 

I think it’s worth a try though. Because we are all wired so different, our brains are all reacting to the MD in various ways. It could be a real game changer for you."

Antidepressants can mute the effects of psychedelics so you may not actually get what you need from the micro dose. 

I recommend reading up on Serotonin Sickness, or Serotonin Syndrome. 

“Just FYI, you will encounter two different types of people here.

1.	⁠don’t mix antidepressants with psychedelics

2.	⁠fuck it, just take more psychedelics

I recommend researching both trains of thought and making an educated decision on what to do. Unfortunately there isn’t enough real research to give us the best info we need. The guess is that the two work in similar, yet different, ways and could cause a serotonin issue. But again, not enough research so maybe it is fine? We just don’t know.

It’s sort of sketchy to use your own brain as an experiment. Ultimately the safe thing to do is to not combine the two.

I’ve thought about EMDR and MDMA as well. My hang ups with EMDR are similar to yours. An expensive, slow treatment that often depends on the person administering it. I’ve been in and out of different modes of “talk therapy” all my life and haven’t ever felt like it’s been helpful for me personally. I don’t deny it isn’t helpful for others. It have even had therapists that have done me more harm than good so I get a little freaked out by that. 

MDMA I have taken before (many many many years ago for fun) and I can actually see the why it would be a good healer in the right setting. I’m hesitant about doing it now because it’s an amphetamine and my resting heart rate is very high. There is mild concern with my Dr about my heart (I get palpitations and it gets off rhythm occasionally). I guess your not supposed to to MDMA with any heart issue.

Helped tremendously with my depression. Was just ok for my anxiety and PTSD, but I felt like it worked the best for depression. 

MDing has a excellent track record for improving depression symptoms. 

Good luck."

It is strange. I thing it may be your diaphragm spasming? But I’m not sure and no doctor ever had an explanation. 

I haven’t had it in years though, thanks to the low fodmap diet and taking overall better care of myself."

That is interesting. I’m super super sensitive right now and even very small amounts of high/medium fodmaps are causing a reaction. Plus, I cannot do dairy at all."

It’s so hard to know what’s really true, and whats actually going on. I wish it were all easier to figure out the truth. 

I tried intermittent fasting and it helped short term, I think just because I was getting less triggers in me. I lost an insane amount of weight, and I’m already skinny, and felt dizzy and bad. But as soon as I started eating more normal portions I went back to the bloat. 

Ativan helps me sometimes if I can’t sleep and am in pain and freaking out, but Im guessing it’s just making me care less and sleepy, not actually doing anything. 

Marijuana also eases pain. Doesn’t actually help treat my symptoms.

Thanks for the response. Wishing you the best of luck. I will check out that book."

I start flat in the morning, and then massive by the late evening. I look pregnant for sure. It effects my sleep. It hurts. I’m so sick of it. 

Eating strict low FODMAP (and I mean strict) is essentially the only help. 

Have you had any treatment yet?"
ibs,f31exp7,t1_f30v57z,1570573977.0,"SIBO is usually diagnosed by doing a breath test. You fast for some hours and then blow into a bag or something, I haven’t done it yet but it’s something to ask about."

I have no answer besides being strict with a low FODMAP diet. It’s the only thing helping me didn’t now, but still not 100%.

ZeroWaste,f2pgkfm,t1_f2p663v,1570342837.0,"I just take out all the poop first, and then I dig around until I find the pee soiled litter area. Urine makes the paper expand, become more dark, and is usually at the bottom. You can see the difference between clean vs dirty paper litter. So I push aside the clean dry litter and scoop up the soiled litter. It takes a little bit more searching and manipulation to clean the box since you can’t just easily sift it, but I’ve never had an issue."

FODMAPS,f2gfc2v,t3_ddels4,1570229974.0,"I normally do a low FODMAP diet, with no meat. But at Disneyland I do become a little more lenient. 

I was able to do some basic fodmaps stuff at DL at my last trip. gluten free, dairy free and vegan are fairly easy to come by. But you have to be a little more careful with a full blown low FODMAP diet.

A lot of restaurants and quick serve have an “allergy menu” if you ask for it. I’ve had places make me super simple stuff like gluten free pasta with just tomato sauce on top. But not every place can make something special. 

Some nicer restaurants you can actually call ahead and speak with them about your food issues and they will be sure to have something made just for you the way you need. But it will take some explaining about what you can and cannot eat. 

They are actually really cool and helpful with food allergies/sensitivities because so many kids have them now. 

If you are super sensitive, bring your own food. If carrying your food around is a problem, I believe there are lockers you can rent (I’ve never used them so idk the deal with that) or consider staying at a hotel very close to the park (if possible) so you can walk there and eat."
