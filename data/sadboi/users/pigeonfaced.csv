Songwriting,fr3end7,t3_gm7vlp,1589855772.0,"You can learn music theory and write songs with either instrument, and you can study both if you want. The first instrument I really studied was bass guitar, and I feel like it gave me a really strong understanding of music theory and song structure. Then I started teaching myself guitar and writing my own songs, and I'm pleased with what I've written. 

An advantage of studying piano in learning theory is that it provides a very intuitive way to visualize music since all the notes are laid out, and it lends itself to more complexity than any other instrument since you can play up to ten notes at once. But I've always been drawn to the sound of guitar and never felt the desire to learn piano. There are songwriters who write from harp or banjo or ukulele. I think Sia and Lorde don't play instruments at all and write just using their voice, which seems impossible to me, but obviously it worked for them. Ultimately it comes down to passion and preference, and there's not one way to learn music or write songs. I'd focus on whichever instrument you like more. There are also a lot of online resources for music theory so you don't have to wait until the pandemic ends to get started (for guitar, I can recommend jerrysguitarbar.com). A teacher can help guide you and make sure you're using good technique, but ultimately what matters most is practice. I would start by learning covers of the songs of the musicians you most want to emulate."
BipolarReddit,fr2ze42,t3_gmcna6,1589846859.0,"Yes, and it really sucks. My whole life was about academia, and then right at the end of college some very traumatic things happened, and I went from being a top student to failing to graduate on time. I totally relate to feeling cursed—so many bad things happened to me that were out of my control. 

However, in a way my mental breakdown was a blessing in disguise because it forced me to realize what I really care about and come to terms with some difficult feelings. I want to use my traumas to help others. I have a lot of family problems, and I want to break these cycles of abuse and do better. It sucks getting set back, but it doesn’t mean that you’re doomed to a life of failure or will never find success or happiness. Some things that helped me let go of self-hatred were embracing spirituality and expressing my feelings through my art. 

Life is full of ups and downs, and better days are ahead. When I was at my lowest, I felt like I would never come out of my depression, but eventually I did. Hang in there. The bad things that happened to you don’t define you, and the pain you’re feeling now won’t last forever. That you’re open to talking about your experiences shows strength and resilience. I believe you can recover and find happiness. Healing from trauma is never easy or straightforward, but it is possible."
GenderCritical,fqslx35,t1_fql0nzp,1589611086.0,"I find it really upsetting. My friend introduced me to The Toast right before I went off to college, and it felt like a special corner of the internet for weird, smart women who invest too much into the art and media they consume. Then towards the end of college Mallory came out as Danny and seemed to lose so much of her sparkle. That essay about the breast removal is devastating. My own college experience ended quite bitterly because of misogyny, and I feel so cynical about misogyny and anti-intellectualism in higher education. Mallory/Danny just seems like the personification of that, and the stuff Grace Lavery gets away with saying publicly while being celebrated as a feminist scholar is vile."
LetsTalkMusic,fqrl0sz,t3_gkk7m8,1589586498.0,"I think dub is meant to be party music, so it’s by design not that deep or musically intricate.

The point is to party and the music is just background noise, so there’s not a ton of artistry."
Antipsychiatry,fqpo19a,t1_fqpigfi,1589550683.0,"If it works for you, that's great. But it feels dismissive because I can see how tightly my moods have been tied to my life circumstances, and I have functioned poorly even during periods of sobriety (well, I guess I've been a regular coffee drinker since 17, but I've always been able to take days or weeks off without issue. I usually don't drink it when I'm on my period or have a cold). I've always felt anxious and unstable at my core, and I've always struggled with insomnia—I cannot remember feeling otherwise, even as a young child. Suicidal ideation has been a lifelong struggle for me. However, my mental health issues only got to the point where I couldn't hide them when I was a really horrible living situation in college—there was kind of a domino effect of traumas, and my parents made things worse when I returned home, and my psych ward stay was really devastating. 

I don't think I would have been able to hold down jobs and support myself the year following my hospitalization had I not had weed and coffee. It was necessary to my recovery that I lived alone. Working helped me build new relationships and find new successes, and I eventually gained back a lot of confidence and intelligence that I had lost. I genuinely do not know how much of how what I was feeling during that period can be blamed on antipsychotics, but holy shit, I would not have held down those jobs without the weed and coffee. My baseline was so bad. So I made a lot of progress in my mental health and was so close to moving to a new city when the pandemic hit and trapped me back in my parents' house, and then the flashbacks and panic attacks and debilitating anxiety returned despite my drug use not changing. 

I want to get off weed because it's expensive and I'm sick of smoking it, but right now while I'm trapped with my parents, I think it's more helpful than harmful. I haven't even been drinking coffee lately, and to suggest that it's causing my panic attacks feels so silly when I know my experiences. 

I just so rarely believe drug use is the root of people's problems, and not everyone is in a position to immediately change their circumstances. Also, it's coffee. The majority of people consume it regularly and its cognitive effects are fairly mild. Everyone has their dietary preferences, but blaming coffee feels like blaming gluten. Some people really do feel better off gluten, but for most people it's fine."
Antipsychiatry,fqov8d4,t1_fqoixic,1589525881.0,"Idk, for you to imply that drinking a cup of coffee in the morning is the source of so many of my issues when over half of American adults drink coffee daily is a bit silly. My life story is insane and convoluted. I'm glad cutting out coffee did so much for you, but there are weeks that I don't drink it and not much changes. I drank absurd amounts following a 40 day psych ward stay where I was at my lowest depression and forced on antipsychotics and basically a zombie. I would go to one restaurant job, drink a bunch of coffee, take a nap, go to my other restaurant job, drink more coffee, then go home and sleep. It made it possible for me to keep my jobs and support myself (I had my mental breakdown the summer after college, and it would not have been possible for me to recover if I was living with my parents), and it made me feel a little less shitty during the worst period of my life. It also calms me down a bit during panic attacks when I can't get anything better. People react differently to substances. I love the taste of wine, but if I had a glass of wine every night I would feel like shit since my body doesn't handle alcohol well. For many people, a drink or two at the end of the day isn't a problem. 

I don't expect medication or recreational drugs to fix me, but I see how they can be more helpful than harmful in certain situations. I have taken concrete steps to improve my life in the past two years, all while using substances. It's not an either/or. It's also coffee of all things, and there's a lot of evidence suggesting it has health benefits.

Edit: I went through your post history a bit, and it seems like you've only been off coffee for several weeks and say that adderall (which is sooo much more potent of a stimulant than coffee) was at a point necessary for you to function. So I'm not sure why you're pushing this anti-caffeine thing so hard. Like if it works for you that's great but it's so far from the biggest issue in most people's lives."
AskLiteraryStudies,fqkqh9j,t3_gjegl9,1589433486.0,"I haven’t read Joyce but my favorite novel ever is Pale Fire by Nabokov which is super abstract and most people would probably find it a nonsensical slog to read. 

I have never hated a book as much as East of Eden by John Steinbeck, which is one of the most lauded books of all time and extremely popular on Reddit. I didn’t hate White Noise by Don Delillo or Nausea by Sartre, but I couldn’t connect with them at all and just don’t get why they’re considered so brilliant. At the end of the day, what makes literature great is subjective and personal. 

I admit I hated reading Shakespeare until my last year of college, and now I understand and appreciate his brilliance. But I wasn’t ready for him in high school. 

Maybe later in life you will have a different experience reading Ulysses, or maybe Joyce just isn’t for you. You could also try reading one of his more accessible works like Dubliners and it might help you understand Ulysses. 

But you’re not obligated to love every great work of literature, and having preferences doesn’t mean you’re stupid or uncultured. Just keep on reading with an open mind and you’ll learn and grow."
Antipsychiatry,fqkla1c,t1_fqketpg,1589429841.0,"I agree in an ideal world (ok besides the no caffeine... I like my coffee) but there have been times in my life that it was unbearable to be sober, all in response to some pretty extreme traumas. Sometimes I literally cannot eat or sleep. Drugs will never solve someone's underlying problems or fix their lives, but they are necessary in certain situations. Healing trauma and establishing a good social life aren't things that happen overnight, and they are not possible under certain circumstances. Sometimes it's just about getting through the day. Sometimes the only goal is staying safe and surviving. 

Have you experienced panic attacks that leave you hyperventilating and dissociating for hours straight? Have you had flashbacks so intense you were immobilized and felt like you were dying? Have you had suicidal thoughts so loud that nothing can distract you from them? 

I'm against the field of psychiatry because it's been used as a weapon against the vulnerable and rarely promotes healing. But sometimes positive thinking ain't gonna cut it and outside help really is necessary."
Antipsychiatry,fqkeqy7,t3_gjdyc0,1589425748.0,"I think it’s a trial and error thing with nootropics, or all drugs really. Magnesium has been the best for reducing side effects brought on by stimulants, and I like the combo of L-theanine and caffeine. However, if I’m too anxious to function, weed or a benzo are the only things that will cut it. I have a very high baseline anxiety though, like I felt literally no effect from hydroxizine. Gabapentin seems to have a slight positive effect but not nearly enough to get me to functioning if I’m in a state where I’m literally paralyzed by my anxiety."
BipolarReddit,fqd35cf,t1_fqczbtl,1589278114.0,"Yeah, some psych wards are much worse than others and I think mine may been unusually bad. The psych I had literally mocked people for opening up about their traumas. He seemed to think watching me suffer was funny and repeatedly gaslighted me. My mother knows how to present well in public and is literally a therapist and able to get my hospital team totally on her side.

There was one resident who I spoke to in holding who could have been so helpful. We really clicked emotionally, and I felt like he was genuinely trying to understand my situation. Unfortunately I didn't work with him beyond a brief evaluation, but I think he could have helped.

I see how psychiatry can be good, it's just that when it's bad it's so bad. And beyond the quality of the staff, the conditions were abhorrent. Without getting into too much detail, I didn't go outside once in 40 days. No matter what brought me in there, I know being locked up so long like that would have fucked me up. It was also during summer, and hot, sunny weather is my favorite."
BipolarReddit,fqcz6wx,t1_fqcyd0b,1589274015.0,"Yeah, I do think antipsychotics have their place, but being on them for years can really fuck people up. I'm also extra bitter because I was given a long term injection of Haldol in the psych ward several weeks into my stay, and I was told explicitly my psychiatrist in the ward that it was because I refused to say I would forgive my mother. And Haldol is definitely harsher than some of the more modern drugs."
BipolarReddit,fqcuula,t1_fqcsjid,1589269707.0,"Ok so I was treading the water with my first comment a bit because I know this sub leans pretty pro-med, but I’m not medicated. I was on a few different combos for maybe nine months and suicidal the whole time. They made me feel so much worse. I pride myself on my imagination and intelligence and antipsychotics absolutely make you stupid, and long term use will cause permanent damage. I think in certain situations they can be useful short term but I have not found a single study that suggests staying on psych meds long term does anything good. Antipsychotics literally shrink grey matter and cause freaky muscular symptoms. 

After my psych ward stay, I was afraid my brain would never come back. It finally did a few months after quitting meds. I’ve been a stoner for years to regulate sleep, and I got straight As in college so I don’t think weed made me stupid. Some people have adverse reactions so it’s not a cure-all, and it’s an expensive habit so I’d like to quit eventually. But I’m living with my parents right now and dealing with some heavy PTSD symptoms, and the weed helps. When I was super fucking suicidal, I would just smoke a few bowls and not do anything drastic. It’s so funny to me how demonized weed is when the side effects from prescribed meds are so much more severe. 

I mostly use my psychiatrist as a therapist because she’s actually caring and actually listens (seriously, why is the mental health field mostly assholes and narcissists?). But having her stamp of approval gives me credibility, and I can get Ativan as needed for panic attacks. 

But yeah, I think psych meds are garbage and antipsychotics are the lobotomy in pill form. At best they’re a band-aid that can get you through a stressful situation, but true healing requires processing your traumas and finding self-acceptance. I’ve had bad luck in therapy, but journaling, creative writing, and playing music are my main outlets. I’ve had really healing conversations with friends who have suffered similar traumas. I’m lazy as shit but I think yoga and dance can be really helpful. I also think there’s value in religion or spirituality—I understand this doesn’t make me look less crazy but studying astrology helped me find a lot of acceptance, both for myself and other people. I believe in karma and want to use my traumas to help others. 

You might be interested in r/antipsychiatry, though the post quality varies. I also think r/CPTSD tends to take a pretty nuanced view of mental health, and it’s an extremely accepting subreddit.

Edit: if the people who downvoted me can show me any evidence that antipsychotics are beneficial long term, I’ll rethink my stance."
AskLiteraryStudies,fqcrqxe,t1_fqcqgo4,1589266779.0,"I don’t see why not. I’ve been meaning to read Bollas because from what I know of his work on schizophrenia it seems like it would align with my views on psychology. I didn’t study Lacan very deeply but what I read just seemed like stating the obvious (our environments impact us) in convoluted language. I’m open to changing my view of Lacan, but I wasn’t impressed by what I read in undergrad. I’m not going to pretend to be super well read on Freud either, but I think he’s on another level of importance as a theorist because his writings are really the basis of modern psychology. Not all of his ideas have held up and some are pretty clearly rooted in misogyny, but his articulation of the unconscious mind is truly revolutionary. I think that’s why Freud has such staying power in academia."
BipolarReddit,fqcr234,t3_gi5l76,1589266152.0,"I believe all mental illness is a response to life experiences, though of course one’s natural brain wiring plays a role. There is no physiological or objective test for bipolar, and it describes such a wide range of symptoms that I’m not even sure what it means really. I relate to the experiences of many people who share my diagnosis, but I feel like I have absolutely nothing in common with others. The stigma is also horrible because I have never been violent and have been extremely responsible my entire life (I stupidly brought myself to the psych ward after suffering a series of traumatic experiences that made it hard to function well, and I didn’t feel safe in my house). Apparently other people know my inner life better than I do :/

Lack of sleep will make anyone crazy and could definitely be the cause of your symptoms. My home life was horrible in high school, and my mother was super controlling so I wasn’t really allowed to do anything but study. I overworked myself in high school to the point where I barely slept and honestly felt better that way because it made me kind of giddy and easier to ignore my home life. If you find the diagnosis useful, then it’s worth identifying as bipolar. If you don’t think it fits, then ignore it. I’m not saying don’t take responsibility for your behavior or neglect your mental health, but being diagnosed bipolar I made me feel like I was doomed to a life of misery and would never lead a fulfilling life. I still speak with my psychiatrist regularly and do what I can to stay healthy, but to me it’s obvious that a build up of traumatic experiences led to my mental breakdown and I don’t like to think of myself as inherently ill. I also hate the stigma because I’m not a violent or controlling person at all and I feel like it’s such a trope that bipolar=abusive. 

Basically, do what you need to do to stay healthy and don’t get too caught up on the label."

CPTSD,fpsxwl2,t1_fppb0m9,1588881478.0,"I actually was fine thinking of myself as bipolar because in my mind it meant intense and volatile moods, creativity, and a history of trauma. After months of deteriorating life circumstances, I had a full break where I was uncomfortably energetic and confident but barely able to eat or sleep, and the thoughts started off as fun but quickly got very dark. I wanted some treatment that would help me stabilize and function better.

I idiotically brought myself to a psych ward and where it was implied that the symptoms of my mental breakdown (all I did when I was manic was walk around and listen to music and message too many people) meant that I am an inherently dangerous person who has no insight into her own feelings or experiences. That traumatic experiences made me emotional was proof I was crazy and delusional. I was told that I would likely need to be medicated for life, even though the antipsychotics they gave me didn't address any of the problems I was having, basically severe anxiety and an inability to eat or sleep. I got out quickly the first time but then was mental health arrested by my parents (my mom literally hates me lol) and kept 40 days and given a long term Haldol injection several weeks into my stay. It made me outright suicidal. They explicitly told me the Haldol was because I refused to say I would forgive my mother. I was on perfectly good behavior in the ward.

The Haldol wore off eventually but every other combo of meds I tried made me feel worse than I did before. I could think about nothing but killing myself. But apparently if I go off them that's dangerous. Well I stopped and no one noticed. I have my up and down days and am still struggling to stabilize after a series of traumas, and I'm not saying I'm the picture of health. But I only started recovering once I stopped meds.

Now that I'm bipolar, my family gets to say I'm manic or delusional whenever I say something they don't like.

So, in my experience, being bipolar means taking meds that make you brain dead and being treated as if I couldn't possible know what I think or feel. So  for those reasons I no longer identify with my diagnosis, and I was diagnosed pretty hastily anyways."

I get that she just wants to keep it her and Finneas right now, but I think she would sound amazing with a live band on some of her louder songs. Billie on vocals, Finneas on acoustic guitar or keys, then throw in a fat bass guitar, drum kit, extra percussion for those sound effects, distorted electric guitar to fill it out, maybe a couple back up singers. I think she'd sound dope. Bury a Friend with the right live arrangement would be mindblowing.

popheads,fpooz34,t1_fpo8hvx,1588788171.0,"Yeah, pitch is just one element of singing. I agree that Swift doesn't sound super polished, but it's not pitchy to the point of being grating (well, in my opinion). She seems totally invested in the performance and like she's relaxed and having fun. Her tone is flirty and playful which suits the song well, and she articulates the lyrics clearly. It's a lighthearted country-pop love song, so if it were sung 100% cleanly I actually think it might lose some of the heart. She seems like she's fully in the song.

I'm not saying it's a remarkable performance, but I enjoyed it, and it seems like it would have been a blast live. 

Gomez to me always just seems like a scared little mouse. Honestly, it's not her pitch that I find so off putting, it's the presence and delivery. She seems uncomfortable on stage, and I guess this is petty but I really can't stand how she says her vowels."

I'll be able to cope but it would be so nice if I could have someone who would just listen compassionately and let me fucking speak for myself."
CPTSD,fpnonvg,t1_fpn58z2,1588769068.0,"Oh yeah I agree that ideally the particular diagnosis is not that important if it helps the patient heal. My gripe is that the Bipolar I label has been used to imply I couldn't possibly know what's good for me. It was determined by a complete stranger after speaking with me for a short time with absolutely no psychiatric records to go off. I genuinely did want treatment and literally was the one who drove myself to the mental hospital the first time, but that was a huge mistake. I know not all facilities are created equal, but the one I was at was horrible. They didn't help me at all in the hospital, they just traumatized me more. I was starving when I checked myself in and I didn't eat for three days straight in the holding area because the hospital was so under resourced. When I was finally admitted to a psych ward, I spoke to a psychiatrist for all of five minutes while I was half asleep and he just asked basic questions about my life. There was no point in my breakdown that I couldn't hold a conversation or answer questions about myself. I complained my way out the first time, but even those five days were deeply disturbing. 

Then a few weeks later things got worse with my mom, and I was mental health arrested and my mom got the staff completely on her side. I had a really traumatic 40 day stay. I was crazy sleep deprived and having panic attacks so I was pretty worked up when I came in, but as soon as I slept I was on perfectly good behavior. I just refused to say I would forgive my mother and refused to deny traumatic events that had happened to me. My psychiatrist injected me with a long term Haldol dose several weeks into my stay because I wouldn't give into his version of events. The Haldol didn't even change my beliefs or memories, it just me extremely uncomfortable physically and ruined my ability to think or feel. It wrecked my imagination, which was my only escape from that environment, and post-Haldol literally the only thing I could think about was killing myself. The worst year of my life followed. So if that was the psych ward's ideal outcome, good for them I guess.

They gave me an MRI in the hospital, and it came back normal. I also got a perfect score on a logic and memory quiz. If you could tell me what the chemical imbalance I'm dealing with please do.

I was working a restaurant job up until the day I was mental health arrested. I loved working and did well at my job, and I loved having normal conversations. I also really fucking needed money so I could eat. I had no problem succeeding in public. What was happening in my home made me snap. 

So I get where you're coming from, but it's not really what moved me to write this post. I'm extremely introspective and have worked through so much since quitting psych meds almost a year ago. I have a lot more clarity than ever and no longer hate myself. On antipsychotics, it was impossible for me process anything about my life. Lithium, the ""gold standard"" for bipolar did nothing but give me shits and acne. I could barely eat or sleep on any of the antipsychotics I tried—Hadlol, Risperdal, Seroquel and Zyprexa. I have had frequent panic attacks and flashbacks since moving back home during the pandemic. Benzos help, and I wouldn't even want them if I wasn't living in my parents' house, but my psychiatrist is stingy as shit with them.

I admit my mental health is a bit of a shit show and that I have dealt with some pretty intense symptoms. I'm just not convinced that drawing rigid distinctions between mental suffering makes sense when there's so much overlap in symptoms, and when one's diagnosis based on nothing more than a random psychiatrist's subjective assessment. There's also the issue of meds changing one's diagnosis—for example, SSRIs can cause mania, so a formerly depressed patient might now be Bipolar II."

To be fair though I mostly tend to listen to less polished folk and singer songwriter music where I can forgive a little pitchiness if the emotions come through.

I would want to ditch diagnoses entirely (ok I get they're for insurance purposes) and just address the symptoms and underlying events. Of course my breakdown looked psychotic because I was thinking about my life via literature and music and astrology and said some nutty shit after being sleep deprived. That I was writing nonstop and talking fast was proof I was manic, but that's literally my personality. Another person in the same situation might totally just shut down and struggle to verbalize anything. 

A possible obstacle to the trauma model is a lot of people don't want to introspect and get defensive at the suggestion, but I really hope it gains more credibility. I think vague physical conditions like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Fibromyalgia are psychosomatic, which is not to say the pain and suffering isn't real or easily dealt with, but that serious introspection and mindfulness seem like the best ways to address these things. I've read a few stories about people dealing with these conditions, and they all seem to be lacking healthy supportive relationships and struggle with their self-worth, but are insulted by the suggest that the root of their pain is psychological.

CPTSD,fpmqiyh,t1_fpml69m,1588739113.0,"Thanks for your insights. 

I agree that Autism can be a useful label for people to understand themselves and find community. I guess it's different too because it can describe personal traits that are unusual but not necessarily harmful. I think it can help people find some pride and acceptance in the things that make them different. I am still not convinced it's a clear cut disorder but I see how it could be helpful for building community.

My frustration is that when I identified more strongly as bipolar, I felt like I was condemned to a life of suffering. It feels so much healthier to think about what happened to me as a temporary mental breakdown rather than a life sentence to misery and insanity. Traits I'm proud of like creativity, sensitivity and resilience could be looked at as positive sides of bipolar, but maybe that's just my personality. I am weird and am fine with being a little crazy, and I admit my mental health is volatile. But I don't want to think of myself as bipolar because it makes me feel like I'm doomed to be miserable."
CPTSD,fpmoh89,t3_ge700l,1588737682.0,"I'm really sorry you've been through all this. If it's any solace, you're far from alone. Young women often turn to sex as a way of validation only to look back and realize many of their encounters were unpleasant or traumatic. It's so hard growing up a girl in this culture with the dominance of social media at the cost of real life intimacy and vulnerability, and I am so worried about the effects of internet porn (seriously, just reading the titles of Pornhub videos will show how hateful, degrading and violent most internet porn is).

You are so much stronger than the men who hurt you. I hate the term ""Daddy Issues"" because it mocks and downplays the impact of a traumatic upbringing. You're not the problem; your dad is. You are not dirty or used up. Then men you slept with do not change who you are. And any man who would discount you because of your sexual history is not a man worth your time. At the moment though, it might be a good to abstain from sex entirely as you process these experiences. When you're ready to put yourself out there again, you will find someone who deserves you. Or, better than jumping straight in to sexual relationships, maybe try seeking out support from a platonic friend/relative/etc you trust.

I understand feeling violated but I promise your body is not used up in any meaningful way. The emotions from these sexual experiences can be crippling, but your body is yours and no man can take it from you. It's a sexist myth that vaginas loosen up with sex. Men don't worry about their penises shrinking from promiscuity.

I promise that your sexual history does not make you tainted or dirty in any way."
CPTSD,fpmkyyc,t3_geay1a,1588735390.0,"Your friends want to support you, that's why they're friends. Of course there's a balance and a limit to what they can give, but if they're asking what they can do it means that they want to help. It can be uncomfortable if you're not used to getting support, but it's really a blessing. I don't know where I'd be without my friends, and I feel good when I can be there for them too. 

The obsessive processing sucks but it's the path to recovery. If the anxiety gets unbearable you might want to try meds as you're working through things, but confronting your pain will help you long term. 

I feel this because I spent so much of my life so wrapped in self-hatred but completely detached from my emotional life and repressed all my traumas. The past couple years I've been having more intense external symptoms, but I've also let go of so much self-hatred and feel like a happy future is ahead.

Whether or not it's full blown psychosis I'm not sure, but I would suggest thinking about some of your life circumstances or traumas that may have caused you to detach. A lot of your symptoms sound like dissociation or depersonalization. Of course, the risk with confronting trauma is that things can get worse before they get better so it's up to you to decide when you feel ready.

Meds might help you cope but they're not going to get to the underlying issues. I think therapy can be extremely helpful, but I think most therapists suck and have had many bad experiences. Personally doing things like creative writing and studying astrology helped me introspect and gave me a lot of insight into myself that I could never get from a professional.

You have basically no control over your life, which sucks. I don’t want to dismiss anything you’re going through. But you’re 16, and characterizing your mental state as lifelong and severe simply isn’t true. You may always have OCD symptoms, but they’ll change as you change, and you’ll find better ways to manage them. No feeling is permanent. It’s not a healthy outlook to feel like you’re doomed to a life of suffering. When you’re in high school, it’s really hard to see outside of high school.

However, I wouldn’t put a ton of weight into the label and rather focus on doing what you need to do to feel better and stay healthy. It’s important to have a psychologist or psychiatrist who really listens to you and treats you as an individual human. A lot of mental health professionals I’ve worked with have been quite dehumanizing and made assumptions about me because of my diagnosis (which my current psychiatrist questions, lol), but good professionals are out there.

There are certain traits we cannot control, like our blood type. One's blood type says nothing about their personality or their behaviors or their character. However, in medical contexts, we distinguish between people's blood types and separate them because it is an issue of human safety.

Sex is another trait that is out of our control. I do not believe anyone's sex should limit their choices in life. However, in certain settings, we need to distinguish between the sexes for people's safety and clarity. These contexts include medical and legal settings. 

I am opposed to the idea that one can choose their own sex because it puts females at risk. In the past, a male sex offender who was incarcerated would not be able to access female people. Now, legal changes pushed by trans activists mean that in certain places, a male sex offender merely needs to say that he is a woman, and it is his right to be transferred to a female prison. I am opposed to these changes because I prioritize female safety.

Honestly, the more I read, the more I think antipsychotics are bad. I think you should go off them if it you can do so safely. They absolutely impact cognitive functioning and have unpleasant physical impacts. The available research has made it pretty clear that they are harmful long term. My experience on them was very negative, and while I feel like I recovered fully, I was only on them several months. After 5 years, I would fear permanent damage. You're also very young and still growing.

I would also switch doctors if you can, because that you need 5 years to recover from psychosis seems completely arbitrary and is not something I've heard before from a medical professional. Everyone experiences psychosis differently, but people usually come down from an early episode pretty quickly. It is also somewhat arbitrary what behaviors or beliefs are labeled psychotic. If your doctor really gave a flat 5 year figure, they were lying because that is simply not true.

However, if you are currently in a psych ward, suck it up and comply so you can get the fuck out. When I was the psych ward, my psychiatrist was accusing me of being delusional about things that were true, but me arguing with him only backfired and got me more heavily medicated.

Antipsychiatry,fmxk69i,t1_fmxd03b,1586466520.0,"You've come at me a few times. I'm happy to explain my position, but I also have found it's a waste of time in many cases.

The reason I post in Gender Critical is because my experiences have been shaped by the fact that I am female. I did not choose the body I was born with, and I do not feel like a woman (idk what that means... women are not a monolith) or have an internal sense of my gender. Female people do have unique experiences and vulnerabilities because of our bodies, and I believe we need specific spaces and language for our own safety and benefit. 

I think adults can make their own medical decisions, and I do not give a rat's ass how people dress. However, I see nonconforming children and teens being pressured to go on hormone therapy when these treatments are experimental and cause major bodily changes. I think, as with psychiatry, these people are being harmed by the medical establishment. I have seen female people in my life cease to identify as women after facing sexual trauma—just like with psychiatric diagnoses, they use their trans identity to avoid working through their traumas. I have seen lesbian friends of mine demonized and called bigots because they are not sexually attracted to penises. I have seen male rapists identify as women in order to gain access to female spaces like crisis shelters and prisons. Transgender theory was extremely popular and widespread at my liberal arts college, which on the whole was extremely wealthy and represented a very privileged segment of society. Outside of that bubble, these issues don't really come up. I think it's pretty clear that there is a social element to trans identities, and I see aspects of the movement as causing harm.

I don't hate trans people, nor do I think anyone should face violence or suffer discrimination because of their identity. But I do not think female people asserting that sex is real and immutable is discrimination; I think it's self-evident and basic feminism. If that makes me a bigot in your eyes, whatever. I'm done feeling guilty for standing up for my beliefs, because I know what my motivations are, and I know how I actually treat people."
CPTSD,fmv65px,t3_fxliqh,1586407109.0,"So much yes. You can’t logic your way out of feelings. Also, sadness, anxiety, and anger are totally justified in many situations. CBT techniques always made me feel invalidated. It also pissed me off because it seemed like the CBT therapists I spoke to had not experienced anything as severe as what I went through, so for them to imply that if I were a stronger person I just wouldn’t have feelings was extremely condescending. 

Personally confronting the bad things that have happened to me, working through them, and giving myself permission to feel helped me move on. If your emotions are so strong they put at risk of hurting yourself or others, that’s one thing. But a good cry is cathartic. After my crisis, I gave myself permission to be depressed for a few months. I stopped putting pressure on myself and basically did nothing but lie in bed and listen to sad music for a few months. Eventually my motivation came back, and I was able to make peace with some painful stuff from my past. 

It’s up to you to decide how much you want to confront right now. In certain situations, it makes more sense to find more shallow coping mechanisms that help you get through each day, especially if you have a lot of work/school/family responsibilities. But I do think in the long term, repressing your traumas only causes more problems. If you don’t think your current therapist is helping, I would suggest seeking out someone who designates themselves as trauma-informed."

Even if I could give my psychiatrist the benefit of the doubt and say he truly believed I was delusional about my mother because it was hard for me to give definitive proof of what she did to me, anybody who knew me that last semester of college would recognize that I had suffered trauma. I even spoke to a (rather unhelpful) therapist who at least could have confirmed my story and gave my treatment team his contact info. Of course they didn’t reach out to him because they weren’t interested in the truth. They had an agenda. They kept saying, “Traumatic events may have occurred. We don’t know.” 

So I see psychiatry as designed to cover up abuse and victim blame, and people who are vulnerable for other reasons (race, sex, sexuality, etc.) are going to suffer worse. But I also knew straight white men from bad circumstances who were treated horribly. So it’s not as clear cut as something like labeling homosexuality a mental illness, but I do think these attitudes still present."
Antipsychiatry,fmuhduq,t3_fxgxh6,1586391448.0,"I didn’t notice external physical changes from antipsychotics (I wasn’t on them very long), but my movements were jerky and stiff, and I barely had facial expressions. A lot of attractiveness is how we present ourselves, so even if my facial features were the same, I definitely felt a lot less pretty and had difficulty connecting to other people. Like, even if someone isn’t conventionally beautiful, their warmth and sensitivity can make them alluring. Antipsychotics take that away, so I think in that sense they make you less attractive."
CPTSD,fmu161s,t3_fxf78n,1586382649.0,"You’re not a bigot. Your feelings are coming from your own fear and trauma, and as long as you can be aware of that and not demonize who dress provocatively, that’s fine. Prioritizing your own needs doesn’t make you a bad person. 

I get really grossed out by gum chewing, which I know is my personal problem. I don’t hate people who chew gum. I asked my ex to not chew gum around me, and he listened and stopped. I know that I was the one who was being restrictive in that case, but relationships are about compromise and he valued my comfort enough to respect that. It would be different if I were being controlling for the sake of being controlling. 

I also think when it comes to issues with female sexualization, it’s very easy to internalize your feelings as proof of something wrong with you. I think a lot of what gets called “feminism” is coming from a disingenuous place, and people use social justice language as a way of controlling others. Personally, I self sexualized because of my own trauma and self-hatred—I thought my only worth was pleasing men sexually. A lot of my friends have did the same thing, and they were being self-destructive. I also have friends who genuinely enjoy sex, and I can respect that. I’m not interested in sex at all right now because I recognize I need to work through my own problems before I can have healthy sexual relationships. That doesn’t make me a prude or mean that I’m doomed to be alone forever. It means with where I am right now, I don’t want to have sex with anyone. 

So when you’re bothered by women in your life dressing provocatively, I would guess your feelings are coming from your own traumas as well as a fear that their behaviors might be self-destructive. That’s not bigotry, that’s sensitivity, and as long as you don’t try to hurt or control other people, there is nothing wrong with how you feel."
Antipsychiatry,fmtmraq,t1_fmr49il,1586375402.0,"Lol, I feel like I spent my life prepping for the psych ward because I was abused by my mother, who is literally therapist, and growing up I was able to detach and channel everything into school. So yeah idk what I want to do exactly but I do want to stand up for people labeled psychotic because it was clear how many of the mental patients were just victims of bad circumstances."
Antipsychiatry,fmqijht,t3_fwu652,1586300286.0,"So the chemical imbalance theory is made up. It was decided in reverse—it was discovered that SSRIs seems to help depression, so pharmaceutical companies pushed the theory that depression is caused by a lack of serotonin. There are chemicals in the brain, but we don't understand them very well. There are no objective tests or brain scans for mental illness. The long term impacts of psych meds are pretty devastating and when people stop they develop withdrawal symptoms that include depression, mania and psychosis. Psychiatrists would say these withdrawal symptoms are proof the meds were working, but that's awfully convenient, isn't it? 

I believe all mental illness is a trauma response. It's up to the psychiatrist's judgement who's emotions get pathologized as proof of something wrong with the patient and who gets treated with sympathy. Psychiatry and psychology have been used to deny the impacts of abuse. I think many of Freud's theories are valuable, but when he discovered how many ""hysterical"" women reported being sexually abused as children, he pushed the narrative of false memories. It was either to blame the victim than destroy the reputations of the respectable men who molested their own children.

However, when you're dealing with heavy feelings and don't have a good support system, it's normal to need outside help. There are bad therapists out there, but a good therapist can be extremely helpful. Personally, I've found more relief self medicating with weed and psychedelic drugs than I've ever gotten from prescribed drugs. Some people have adverse reactions to weed, so it's not for everyone. Creative and athletic outlets can be very helpful too. Unfortunately it can be a challenge to find what works for you, and some mental health professionals will set you back. In the psych ward I was accused of being delusional about very real things that happened to me, and my first therapist basically told me all my feelings were wrong. But recovery is possible. I was diagnosed Bipolar I and told I would need meds for life. Nope, meds made me worse, and I've been doing better since I stopped almost a year ago. I still speak with my psychiatrist regularly, so I have the stamp of approval from a mental health professional for the record.

I'm weird and artsy and love astrology but that doesn't mean I'm dangerous. So much of psychiatry is about conformity and authoritarianism."
BipolarReddit,fmmghe7,t1_fmmetb3,1586204832.0,"I also had a very traumatic childhood and realized my health symptoms were jut a response to that. So rather than focus on what my diagnosis is, I've tried to figure out what I need in order to recover. Everyone's trauma is specific to them, and everyone's path to healing is different. In the psych ward normal emotions I was having were pathologized and taken as proof that something was inherently wrong with me. The truth is it's much easier to blame someone's suffering on themselves than confront serious abuse. 

So rather than get caught up on the diagnosis, just try to figure out what you need to do to heal. Easier said than done, of course, but a better future is ahead. Good luck"

Antipsychiatry,fmfabao,t1_fmebq5a,1586023092.0,"Long term, no.  But short term, yes. And chemotherapy is a short term treatment. So, if the government were merely mandating short term use, how would you feel?

I believe there is a strong psychological component to cancer based on how it has manifested in people close to me and the fact that it follows trends. I think there may be better treatments than chemo, but I don’t think society is ready. Although it does seem like people are waking up to psychiatry at least. 

But I guess my biggest question is why you want the government to make people’s medical decisions for them.

EDIT: idk if anyone’s seen that Joseph Gordon Levitt movie 50/50 about cancer, but if I’m remembering correctly, JGL’s character is obsessive about his health and terrified of death. He contracts a rare form of cancer anyways—life is so unfair! His girlfriend dumps him, and she’s totally demonized, and I remember they make fun of her paintings. Well it seems like the girlfriend was not being emotionally supported in the relationship, and she shouldn’t feel guilt tripped into supporting him through his crisis. The girlfriend could be typed as BPD/Bipolar. And watching that movie I never thought they would actually let JGL die. 

It’s a movie, not real life. But it was playing into a cultural narrative about cancer, and it has been used as a tool of emotional blackmail many times in my life. So I don’t have a study but that’s my thinking."

But actually I reached back to my current psychiatrist and she was very understanding, and she talked me down from a panic attack over the phone. It's wild the number of mental health professionals I had to go through until I found one who actually cares about making me feel better, but I finally did.

Yeah, weed has been a lifesaver. Here's to healing."

Antipsychiatry,fm9h79z,t1_fm951ya,1585868670.0,"Thanks, I appreciate your perspective. I also don’t automatically hate everyone involved in psychiatry—some of the nurses and techs in my ward were actually very sweet and supportive, and there was one psychiatric resident I spoke to in holding who did make a genuine effort to engage with me and understand me. Like, even in that brief conversation, he did get me to calm down and back down from some of my more delusional conclusions because he recognized that I had suffered trauma and was attempting to work through my experiences. There was another resident who joined my team during the last few days of my stay, and while I didn’t have as strong an emotional connection, I did feel like he wanted to help me get out of the psych ward and saw me as an actual person. 

I actually spoke with my current psychiatrist again today and was able to smooth things over and get across what I had been trying to express. She is genuinely caring, and I recognize I probably just overreacted to a misunderstanding. 

I think you’re right that it isn’t the time to really dig into everything, but it’s also coming up anyways. I am having flashbacks that I can’t just turn off, but I just need to address them as they come rather than try to solve everything. I’m not sure your metaphor really applies to my situation since I was having like constant suicidal thoughts the whole time I was on meds, and I believe the therapist I saw for about a year following my break was counterproductive. But I also don’t believe facing my past is something I should put off indefinitely because I believe repression only causes more problem long term, and I know I am capable of processing everything. The temporary distress is really nothing compared to the long term impact of holding it in. So not that panic attacks are a sign of great health, but I no longer have the same self-hatred or experience the same inexplicable physical pains I did before my psychotic break because I’m able to make sense of my experiences. In a way I’m glad to have been psychotic (and honestly my internal experience of psychosis was really just intense flashbacks. At the time I didn’t label it that way but I was just overwhelmed by memories and couldn’t turn them off) because it forced me to come to terms with my true feelings. I was completely cut off from my emotions until I left home for college, and now that I’ve been able to untangle my psychosis my life actually makes sense. 

I became psychotic after a series of devastating circumstances, and my mental state deteriorated over months. So I’m not just gonna snap, don’t worry. My safety is not at risk; it’s just a lot to bear. 

Or maybe, using your metaphor, my flotation device is weed, although medical professionals don’t like hearing that, lol. But God has it helped..."
Antipsychiatry,fm82qwf,t1_fm7hqr1,1585841702.0,"Thank you for your response.

I have tried to integrate my experience into my philosophy. I always had a ""fuck the man"" streak, but I still grew up with a ton of pressure to succeed in a traditional way and strive for status and prestige. I chased a lot of academic achievements that meant nothing to me. Going from a top college to the psych ward to the restaurant industry made me realize how silly it all is. There are smart people everywhere and intelligence shows in many ways. Many white collar jobs require you to believe that you're inherently better than other people, but if you could make it to a top school without realizing that your placement there has more to do with your circumstances than your inherent brilliance, you're not half as smart as you think you are. 

So I've learned to value genuine human connection and kindness more than anything. I've learned help means giving people the tools to empower themselves and not deciding what's best for them. I've learned life is just fucking unfair, and most problems are too big to fix. But compassion makes it easier.

As much as the hospital sucked, it did make it impossible for me to pretend to care about the things I'm supposed to care about. I do feel more inner clarity than I ever have. Hope all is well with you."
Antipsychiatry,fm7yvcl,t1_fm78uz2,1585839536.0,"Thanks so much for your reply.

As much as the psych ward sucked, it did make me realize how many advantages I have. I'm so grateful to have been educated because being able to speak and write well do give me power. And learning to think critically helped me see what was so wrong with the psych ward—thank God I studied Foucault. I may hate my mother, but I still do have a family that has the wealth and education to sue if something went really wrong. A lot of people in there had little education, no money, no family, no job, and no support system, which meant they would never be able to take legal action. I know someone who straight up got punched in the face. They didn't treat me well, but they weren't gonna punch me in the face. It seemed like a lot of people were victims of the system—they're deemed problem kids in school, medicated and treated like criminals, and can never find a way out.

I'm glad I listened to my instincts and didn't go on psych meds before. My college's counseling center wrote prescriptions left and right. Seroquel was commonly prescribed for sleep. When I met people who could barely function taking 8 different meds with multiple antipsychotics, I had to wonder what those drugs were doing.

I mostly had no issue with the other patients, but there was one guy who was super creepy. He mostly left me alone, but he did attach himself to women with histories of domestic and sexual abuse, going as far as peeking in their rooms while they slept. He picked women who wouldn't complain, and the hospital did nothing. I was tempted to say something when my team asked if I had a problem with any patient, but I was afraid it would backfire and didn't. 

Writing my story and reading responses did help me calm down, so that's something. I do want to try therapy again because I like an in-person connection, but I don't think now is the best time. I just want someone to listen to me vent without pathologizing it. I agree it's totally a character thing. Your average waitress or bartender is a more compassionate ear than 90% of the people in the hospital."
