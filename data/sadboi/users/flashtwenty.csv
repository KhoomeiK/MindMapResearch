ect,fpikn3o,t3_gdn017,1588642882.0,"That sounds horrifying. I am so sorry you went through that. You should tell them again and don’t down play it (I don’t know about you, but I have a tendency to down play things). I would call them ahead of time and speak with a nurse or the ECT doc. Explain what happened, how it made you feel,  your fears now, and ask what can be done to make sure it doesn’t happen again.

Honestly, after months of ECT, I had to stop. It wasn’t helping me anymore and my memory was getting really, really bad. I understand if this is not an option for you, but if your fear is that great, and you can stop, it might outweigh the benefits. Being in pain and traumatized after each session would convince me stop. Whatever you decide to do, please be kind to yourself. Only you know your limitations and what feels right."

nintendo,fokj61q,t3_g7vuf0,1587843046.0,"I feel as though to understand what I want to do in the future, a little explanation is needed. This year has been a lot for my family. I am a mom of one, married to a great husband. I struggle with major depressive disorder, bad anxiety and was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2. The beginning of this year, I tried to hurt myself and I was inpatient for a week. I started a new treatment while in there, but I dropped recently because it was not working. Now  I am on a new medication, but it is too soon to find out if it is working.

My family has been through a lot because of me being in patient and going through these treatments. We are a gamer family and enjoy all sorts of games. My husband is especially good at fighting, bullet hell, and other games that require quick reactions. My daughter loves adventure and life simulator games. I am also a fan of adventure and life simulator games, but lately I need something a little simpler to handle my current state.

Being at home means we get to spend a lot more time together, although my husband and I still have to work. Luckily, my husband works from home right now while I work from home three days a week. She is having a hard time being away from her friends at school and find ways to cope by painting, watching movies and playing a lot of Animal Crossing.

We have been after another Switch for awhile, but haven’t been lucky enough to get one when it is in stock. We would like to be able to go to each other’s islands and have more freedom on designing our own islands. Plus, it would open up the possibility to play so many other games together co-op. Ultimately, what I want to do in the future is to be happy with my family. Being truly happy is really hard for me and finding those moments can be so difficult. Being able to play co-op would give us another opportunity to find happiness, especially right now when we are limited to staying inside. Thank you for reading."

Things seemed better at first, then not. 

I’m finally giving up on ECT. I was suppose to go on Friday, but I just can’t do this any more. The memory issues are overwhelming and depressing in themselves. I don’t really remember much at all from the end of last year. My memory and capacity to retain have changed so drastically that I had to leave school.

I feel like watching some shows I am watching for the first time, even though I watched the whole series already. I have days where I am okay, but usually halfway through the day I lose steam. Every day is a struggle.

ect,fjx1r86,t3_ff5h1z,1583652834.0,"ECT doesn’t necessarily start working right away, but you might notice a few things here and there that seem different. I started to enjoy things more, realize that I wasn’t as numb to certain things (like a violent event in a TV show), and feel motivated to do more. It feels like a slow process, and, honestly, kind of strange, but it feels great that I am even seeing glimpses of happiness. I was initially receiving ECT three times a week. Now the break between sessions is about two weeks. I’m not working still and I’m still not allowed to drive, but it is small price to pay. I should be going back to work next month.

If you have other health issues, it is important for the doctor to know. For instance, I get migraines. Therefore, they give me headache medicine by default every session. Otherwise, if you don’t get migraines and you don’t get a headache the first session, they might not give you headache medicine in the future. Also, one thing they didn’t mention to me is that there is the potential to pee yourself during the seizure. It’s not a big deal as they have a pad thing (reminds me of a puppy training pad, to be honest) to catch any leaks. They told me that I most likely wouldn’t since I’m young, but I have more times than not.

The anesthesia can make you feel kinda out of it for the rest of the day. Be kind to yourself and avoid making any decisions/buying stuff. I’ve made a few mistakes, but usually catch myself.

Try not to worry too much. The treatments are pretty easy to get through and quickly become routine. If they have trouble finding your veins for the IV, use some small weights to work your arms a bit. It will help. Good luck!"

Other times I feel fine enough to get up (with a little help), get changed and drink/eat a little something before heading home. I think the most important thing is just listening to your body and making sure you get what you need."

surgery,fipj830,t3_f8y4qy,1582608611.0,"Hello! I’ve had two surgeries and I am currently receiving ECT (Electroconvulsive therapy). The surgeries I’ve had were pretty simple, one was to remove a benign breast lump and the other to repair scar tissue from an episiotomy. For both surgeries and for every ECT treatment I am put under anesthesia. The nurse press the IV in and attached a saline drip. They wheel the bed into the treatment room and they attach wires with sticky things on them to me. The anesthesiologist injects the anesthesia. It feels a little funny going in and sometimes gives me a metallic taste. Before I know it, I can’t keep my eyes open any longer and I’m out. While I’m knocked out, they give me oxygen to ensure I am breathing properly. I wake up in the post treatment room where a nurse is watching over me. ECT doesn’t cause any pain, but my two surgeries did. They took a few weeks to heal from. They weren’t bad, though. I was anxious both times, but honestly really glad to have both surgeries.

I hope your surgery goes well. Make sure you listen to your doctor’s orders for recovery. It’s important to take it easy. You will feel pretty groggy afterwards, kind of wobbly and maybe a little weak. Good luck!"

ect,fip01uy,t3_f8pgi2,1582594969.0,"Hi! I find your account of ECT to be really fascinating. It’s not super different from mine, as there are many similarities. I hurt myself at the begging of the year. I can’t even see the scar on my wrist anymore. I went to the ER and was taken to a psych ward for a week. In there, they decided that due to the amount of medications I have tried over the past several years not working as hoped, that I should start ECT. My initial meeting with the doctor led to the decision that ECT would be appropriate for me and we decided that the first session would be while I was inpatient. The rest of my sessions would be outpatient. I am very lucky to have a husband who can take me. Initially, mine was also Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Then it went down to twice a week, now once a week. 

The treatments are pretty similar to yours. No food or drink after midnight the night before. I get to the hospital along with my husband. I change into a gown, but I can keep my top and bra on. Pants and underwear off. The reason is that the treatment can cause you to lose control of your bladder. It doesn’t always cause me to, but sometimes it does. It’s really not a big deal if it does happen. 

After getting changed, the nurse comes in and puts in my IV and attaches it to the saline drip. I get come on the bed and they soon wheel me into the treatment room. They attach the wires and sticky things to my forehead, behind my ears, on my chest and belly. My treatment is bilateral. The anesthesiologist injects the anesthetic and headache medicine, I sometimes taste a metallic flavor, and before I know it I can’t keep my eyes open any more. They give me oxygen while I’m out, but it’s not anesthesia gas. 

Soon after, I wake up really groggy. There is a cool pack machine thingy on my head to help prevent headaches. Once I wake up, they ask if I have a headache. If I don’t, they remove the cool pack. Next they wheel me into another room and my husband comes in to help me get dressed. Next they give me something to eat and drink (usually a muffin and juice or water). They do not let me walk out and I honestly don’t think I could as I am very wobbly. My husband leaves to get the car as the hospital has valet. One of the nurses takes me down in a wheelchair and I had home. 

They test my memory once a month. I have had problems with my memory. Sometimes I can’t piece sentences together, like you. Other times I don’t remember something that just happened, happened recently, or happened awhile ago. I’m not allowed to drive, doctor’s orders. I’m not sure when I will be able to. It’s kind of frustrating. I’m off work for awhile longer and not sure how much longer I’ll need regular treatments.

My mood has been improving, but I still have hard days where my mood drops really low. Usually I’m fine the next day. This process has been really tough for my family, but we know it’s worth it if it ends up improving my mood. Thank you for your story. It is interesting to read another person’s experience. I hope that everything continues to go well for you."
Anxiety,fil0u6e,t3_f8caqe,1582491235.0,"I found that I don’t always take enough time for myself. It is important to do things for yourself. Like right now I am getting a pedicure and then going to eat great food with my family. I also spend time coloring in adult coloring books, doing word searches, and playing with my dogs. I try to watch where I spend my money, but I also treat myself.

My anxiety can be really bad some days. Those days I have medication I can take, which makes me pretty loopy. It’s necessary, though. If I freak out too much, my blood pressure goes crazy. So, I do best I can to take care of myself. Life can be overwhelming. I really understand where you’re coming from. Taking one day at a time is the best I can do right now. Maybe you need to slow down a little? Take a vacation? Even just taking a day to do something different from your norm can help. Good luck to you."

depression,ez81g6w,t1_ez5eqhb,1567731969.0,"My husband is in the same situation you are in. He often has no idea what to do, but having him there for me is usually what I need. I cannot speak for others, so I can give some suggestions on what helps me. I respond really well to personal attention and being taken care of. Some things that my husband might do for me are brushing or washing my hair, cooking meals, making tea or bringing water, and giving lots of hugs (especially ones that he initiates). 

When I'm depressed (which is all the time right now), it can be very hard to find the energy or desire to do the things I used to love to do. My hobbies are sitting around waiting to be done, but I can hardly even look at them. I just started going to work again this week, and I am hating it. My energy is even more sapped than it was before, but it will help push me into a routine. If you try to develop a routine with him, start off small and simple. Exercise is great, but sometimes all we can muster at first is just getting off of our safe place and taking a step outside. Then sitting outside in the sun for a bit. Next taking a walk down the street, then around the block. Little steps help. Small goals are motivators.

Also, if you know what is causing his depression, it can help you cater the routine around it or to tackle it (depending on what it is). For example, if someone had a back injury and could hardly walk, they could potentially get better by going to physical therapy, massage therapy, pain management, and/or a chiropractor. Their depression could stem from them not being able to be as active as they used to be. If you don't know or he doesn't know what is causing the depression, it is okay. You can still work on building a routine that is catered to him. 

When someone is suicidal, they are asked if they have a plan (as well as some other questions) by their treating physician/therapist/nurse at the time. If you are really afraid he is going to hurt himself, he can be taken to a hospital and they can keep him for some time (as least if you are in the US, not sure about other countries?). The good thing is that he is talking with you. Keep the conversation going. Even if you talk about random nonsense or childhood stories. Sometimes anything can help. Good luck."
birthcontrol,eyxzzyi,t3_czdear,1567567117.0,"I’m so sorry you had to go through that. The NP acted very unprofessional. It does sound like the best option would be to have the IUD removed considering what you are going through, but I am not a medical expert. I agree with the others about asking for a different provider. You need someone who has more compassion, and they do exist. Don’t give up, it will get better. I hope you can see someone soon and that they will help you with exploring other methods of birth control."
depression,eyxx8pe,t3_czadw0,1567564911.0,"I agree with you. I have many regrets and had a child when I was still a teen. The job I have right now is awful because the management is awful (they bully their employees). I haven’t finished college, even though I have a ton of college credit.

My child is now a teen. I graduate from college next year. I still work the same shitty job, but thankfully only part time right now. I am not giving up, but it is so hard to keep fighting when the depression and so many other factors are up against me. A reset button, with the knowledge I have now, would require making some very difficult decisions. I really wonder if my life would have been better had I just stayed in school instead of having a child. Who knows... but I know I love my baby."
developer,ewo0bws,t3_cp6ibd,1565599377.0,"Don’t give up. Self-doubt is normal while going through school. I have felt the same way many times as I am progressing through a mobile development degree. I, too, am female and have noticed that it is a male dominant field. For me, that’s okay since I get along better with males. I attend school online and do not experience a lot of chatter. There are, however, topics I do not understand and I have even failed a couple classes. I’ve learned to ask more questions and talk to more people in my class as well as to instructors. When I don’t know something, I do a web search. If I can’t find what I need or I get stuck in my code, I ask for help.

I love the program I’m in. Puzzles and problem solving are my thing, but art is, too. It is possible to combine design and programming, but it depends on the job and what they will allow you to do. If you are passionate about your field, then keep with it and find a way to enjoy art, too. Personally, mobile development grants me the opportunity to play around with some graphics in my mockups and in the creation of my apps. I do, however, love to draw, paint and create jewelry on the side. Having those outlets gives a good break from all the homework. I’m sure you’ll do just fine. Also, your English is good. :)"
