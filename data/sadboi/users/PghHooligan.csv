AskReddit,fk6ul6u,t3_fgmrc9,1583916846.0,"Fucking Dirty Brian! Alright here we go! So me and my little brother are riding our bikes around one day (we lived in the hood, and we had really nice bikes...and we're white, so naturally we would fight a lot). We find ourselves in a vacant lot next to this old gas station, when all of a sudden Dirty Brian shows up and says ""gimme dat bike"" (he's talking to my little bro) so I'm like FUCK all the way outta here, throw my guard up and proceed to give my man the business. Didn't even take a lick. Beat that fools entire ass quick fast. Anyway, fast forward to literally the next day - me and my older brother are out, riding bikes like we would do every damn day, when we decide to hit this shortcut behind the high school. Now, I'm a skinny dude. Pretty recognizable. My brothers are more stalky, and they're exactly the same size and we all have the same face...cuz were brothers, you know? Anyway, mid shortcut, who jumps out like he's about to pull some grand theft bike type shit? Dirty Brian. Again. I'm behind my older brother zooming through this little path and all I hear is ""gimme dat bike"" and my brother straight punched this dude in the eye while he is ON THE BIKE! He never even tried to stop. This punch sounded like no punch I've ever heard before. Dudes feet went straight up in the air and he landed flat on his back. But it didn't end there - while dirty Brian was laying there explaining to God why he was sent there, 3 dudes come out of the cut talking every kind of shit a person could talk, so me and big bro throw the guards up but they weren't actually trying to fight the 2 dudes who just beat their friends ass twice in as many days. Turns out, Dirty Brian saw us coming, thought my older brother was my younger and got put to sleep standing up. He ended up with a broken orbital bone and now he has a droopy right eye. Him and his pap tried to confront my dad about this incident and his pap got choked. Bad. That's it. Thanks for reading. Have a good one."
