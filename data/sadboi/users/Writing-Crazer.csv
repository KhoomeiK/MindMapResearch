Screenwriting,ewz1rdb,t1_ewu13jk,1565889959.0,Thank you so much! That’s fantastic advice. I appreciate you taking your time to help me.
mentalhealth,ewhtvct,t3_codaz3,1565422136.0,"I completely understand that. Therapy can be hard. I always dreaded therapy a bit because I hated having to voice the thoughts that scared me. 

I would consider bringing this feeling up to your therapist. I’m sure they are used to their clients feeling this way. They may even have some tips on how to deal with this feeling!

I’m proud of you for taking action to work on your mental health. It’s hard to go to a therapist, especially when you have to take time out of a really busy schedule. 

Sending love your way!"
mentalhealth,ewhtqed,t3_coe9mh,1565421934.0,"Have you considered bringing this up to your therapist and maybe the person who prescribed you the medication? I personally have no experience with the medication you are taking, however I know many people have different reactions to antidepressants. I feel like if the sudden shift happened recently and you started taking the medication recently, it could be a negative reaction to the medication. 

Again, I’m not sure about this at all. I just have a friend who felt depressed as a result  of her anti-anxiety medication. Sometimes it takes a while to find the best medication for you!

I’m sorry you are going through this. I wish I could be of more help. I would definitely bring this mood shift up with your therapist. I am thinking of you and wishing you the best of luck."
mentalhealth,ewhtj2t,t3_co584f,1565421639.0,That’s incredible! Congratulations! I’m proud of you.
mentalhealth,ewhth74,t3_coeued,1565421564.0,"I don’t know exactly what it is, but I would really consider going to a therapist. I have anxiety and it focuses on my romantic relationship a lot. I also have some depressive symptoms. It’s so hard, but it can be improved, really. 

You are going through a lot of changes! Of course you are feeling overwhelmed. That being said, help is out there. If you have insurance, I would look at getting a therapist covered by insurance. Then you can bring up to them whether you are interested in medicine. I take medicine for my anxiety and it’s really helped me, but many people prefer to just use other techniques.

If you don’t have insurance, I have heard Better Help offers online therapy for decent prices.

It will get better. It’s a cliche to say that but I believe it’s a cliche because it is true."

I tutor a student who just took her Language Arts test today, and it's been a few hours and we still haven't received the scores, but I heard sometimes it can take longer for the rla test.

Anxiety,esvfr8g,t1_esuyagp,1562298365.0,"You will. As cheesy as it sounds, it really does get better. About 6 months ago, I was in such an awful place with my anxiety. I committed time to finding a therapist and it changed my life! She worked through a book with me called the Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders.  

The book takes some of the tips OP gave and really helps you put them into practice in your every day life. I don’t know if this book is right for you! Everyone copes in different ways, but you aren’t alone, and you can do this.

For me, anxiety and mental health can come in waves. Maybe you are at a low point right now, but the tide will come, and you will drift higher again. 

(Sorry if this sounded preachy at all or I made assumptions about what you are going through! It was just a message on my heart.)"
Anxiety,esvea5i,t3_c95qy9,1562297723.0,Thank you so much for this! These are some absolutely incredible lessons.
generalizedanxiety,eqxu17m,t3_bulz3g,1560373915.0,"Hello! I have had many not-amazing therapist experiences, but then this year, when I was at my lowest, I found an incredible therapist. She honestly changed my life. For me, it was a matter of finding the right person for me and really committing time outside of our sessions to work on the coping mechanisms she recommended and read the book she gave me. I really loved the book which can be self-guided! It helped me change how I think about my anxiety. It's called Unified Protocol for Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders. It looks like a boring textbook, but I loved it so much! For me, anxiety comes and goes, so try not to get discouraged. It will get better! And I am proud of you for considering a therapist even though it hasn't always worked out for you. It was hard for me to say I needed to look for a therapist again, but I am so glad I did it!"
