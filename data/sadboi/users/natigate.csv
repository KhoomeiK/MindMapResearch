So around that time I decided to delay thinking about suicide. It's such a heavy feeling to carry around. It taints everything you encounter and think about. So I consciously put it away for two years. Every time those thoughts or feelings came up I'd say no. I'm not going to entertain these thoughts right now. If I am going to kill myself, I'm not gonna do it until this specified date in the future, so there's no point in getting sad today. I did my best to do positive things. Stay active. Read a lot.

Sort of a way to gain bodily autonomy, or replacing the memory of that act with a more positively associated sexual experience.

On the other hand survivors sometimes have a need to repeat their trauma because they're not aware of it. Say a child growing up with parents in an abusive relationship, then that child seeking out an abusive relationship as an adult. It's what they learned or what they know.

Then there's people who've been subject to childhood/teen sexual trauma and grow up to be pedophiles themselves. This one baffles me the most, but I haven't had the stomach to look into what twists someone that way vs becoming hypervigilant about potential rapists in the world.

Now that I think of it, my mother also once had a knock on the door in the middle of the night.

My mom could see a figure that was about the same size and shape as my niece. When she opened the door it was a women, only wearing a tshirt, crying and she just collapsed on my mom's floor.
