Veterans,f398w3n,t1_f391neh,1570745105.0,They were pretty judgmental of that too.
BipolarReddit,f37wq53,t3_dfr2fz,1570731155.0,Oh Yeah.
Veterans,f37wm41,t1_f35gg4p,1570731119.0,Not always.
Veterans,f37wjv3,t1_f35ev2i,1570731097.0,This. You never know if someone’s issues are permanent or temporary
BipolarReddit,f268fjy,t3_dantfn,1569997986.0,I was diagnosed Bpd at first.
BipolarReddit,f267dcp,t3_dc2351,1569996587.0,To just smoke weed instead of taking meds.
BipolarReddit,f2674y4,t3_dc439f,1569996274.0,I don’t think this is a bipolar thing. I’m very empathetic I know people who are self absorbed without bipolar. It can be worked on and can improve as you get older also.
BipolarReddit,f254jpy,t3_dbwadu,1569965762.0,"If you’re on anti psychotics you won’t feel the lsd. Now I have done it and you have to go off your meds to trip which isn’t advisable. I also noticed lsd could launch me into hypomania or deep depressive episode. I have had both experiences, even after a “good trip”. If you do it please have a trip sitter. Research. Be careful. As someone who has, I really don’t recommend."

BipolarReddit,f1dch0m,t1_f1d8xpe,1569379808.0,I’m in school. Oddly enough for psych. Considering social work to be a victim’s advocate maybe.
BipolarReddit,f1d77m0,t1_f1d3g3p,1569375689.0,This is true. I was in the military when I was diagnosed. Not in anymore. I can relate to how OP feels. Everyone knew everything. I dedicated 7 years of my life to my job and it was gone after a year of investigation. It’s definitely stressful. It’s sad. It’s scary. Praying for you OP.
