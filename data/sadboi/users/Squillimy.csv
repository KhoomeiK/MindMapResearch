I understand the reasoning for the decision, but nearly every person would deem genocide as an evil act regardless. Which would contradict the persona he's aiming to achieve. I personally just think it goes against MCs goals based on his own words.

I guess my question is does genocide really gain respect, or just fear? It even says that most citizens believe this to be a plot of the sorcerous kingdom, yet he didnt even attempt to qualm said fears."
overlord,fn2j81h,t3_fxcq0j,1586590998.0,"Was kind of blown back that they decided to destroy the country completely, including innocents. I get that this series is dark and Ains only cares about nazarick, but he still remembers being human. He even still feels emotion for his old guild mates (though it's immediately supressed). But disregarding that, he worries so much about the development of his ""NPCs"" but seems to not be concerned about them becoming heartless dictators that do not care for human life at all. He tries teaching them so many things, except for empathy lol.

Even with the genocide plan, wouldnt it have made more sense to annihilate the foolish noble and everyone who rules (or even lives) in his domain, rather than the country itself? That wouldve allowed them to continue with the original plan, while keeping the guise of being a ""fair ruler"".

Don't get me wrong I still love the series but I mean he literally said he didn't want to rule through fear, and now hes annihilating an entire country over a single supply caravan to make people fear his power & authority..."

Love anime / manga but sometimes it bothers me about similar novels/animes is that the MC is always some sexless teenage saint. The only problem I have with the magic school arc is that it doesn't really focus at all on what he's learning. Every few chapters it's just something like ""now I've upgraded from intermediate detoxification to advanced detoxification"" or ""advanced healing to saint ranked healing"". I sort of wish they would've explained what that actually means, or went into how his knowledge of science applies to his methods of learning new magic. Sure, being able to create a thunderstorm is cool. But personally, one first things I would've learned how to do is fly. Still a great series."

Just hold down run while staying just out of range, learn when his combo is over (like when he sits to fart, or after he rolls around on his back, or after he tackles, then learn the # of attacks u can get in, and always run away after. If ur running away when he throws his poop u avoid it easily.

Second phase when he does sweeping sword attack combo just block while walking towards him, and if he misses the third strike u can easily run behind him. If he hits the third strike get back. Also the jumping sweep attack is easy to vault over.

I used floating passage for quick strikes and shinobi firecracker for even extra attacks or heals when needed.

But I do love partying and my work definitely took a hit because of it. I noticed and cut down on the coke by myself, but unfortunately one of the side effects of coke is that ""invincible"" feeling.

You end up going from doing it at a friends place to doing it in your car outside a party / a bar before you walk in. You end up looking for it when you're drinking because it would make the night better. You end up partying more and doing more reckless things because you never got caught for it before. You end up putting yourself in danger by buying it from people in public situations.

And then you suddenly you get caught. And it's something you have to deal with for the rest of your life. It sucks cause I love doing it and I'm confident I'm not addicted, but honestly it's hard to enjoy it because of what it did to my life. After I got arrested my work took a hit and I got fired. 2 weeks later my girlfriend left me for someone else. If I had only been a little safer.

So while I'm not trying to push my ""come up"" story or say the same thing will happen to you. I'm just saying you really never know what will happen.

My girlfriend was dating someone else 3 weeks after we had a huge fight that was my fault and we broke up. She did the same thing. She constantly tried to make me jealous of him too. Even sent me pictures of their first date and made sure to let me know they had sex.

We later sort-of got back together but it obviously wasn't the same. She met a guy while we were on a trip together with a some friends we know. She started talking to him behind my back before she brought him up in conversation like 2 weeks later. Didn't think anything serious would come of it since she made it sound like he was a weirdo. Literally invited me over to hangout just a couple weeks after that and I find evidence she slept with him just hours before when I walk into her apartment. Breaks up with me 2 days later, cancels all plans (trips, concerts etc) we made for the next couple months, starts dating him and does all those plans with him instead.

Fucking sucks but you have to accept that's what kind of person they are. It still hurts to think about it still but as time goes on you really do see all the red flags you ignored because you were in love with them.

EDIT: I went through the second part of what I said immediately after I got arrested and lost my job. I'm a completely broken person. I know it sucks and this may not help but it could be worse. Focus on things you still have & can do even with your SO problems. I went the other route of desperately trying to get her back with total disregard to my own mental health and trust me that path leads nowhere good. You end up so much more depressed. Had I not done that I wouldn't have been arrested and I'd probably still have my job. I know this kind of girl because I dated this kind of girl. If you show her how sad you are and how much you want her back, she's going to lose more and more interest in you. She wants to make you jealous to show you & herself she can do better than you and improve her own sense of self-worth in some backwards way. If you give her the satisfaction she'll dump you to be with someone else in the most cold-hearted way possible. It'll likely be the first person who's willing to fuck her and not toss her out of the apartment the next morning, making you feel all the more worthless. If you really wanted her back (and I don't suggest it) the only way is to let her see that you're fully capable of moving on by pursuing your own goals."

I get it though. I've spent most of my life without a relationship so I can come across emotionally secure & confident at times. I give space but even if a girls just a casual hookup I still stay friends with them. I just let them know I'm not interested in much more at the moment, but I'll still hangout with them. Lots of guys don't do this. They'll only hangout with a girl they've slept with if they're dating or for a quick booty call. I guess the term is Friends with Benefits? But really actually being friends. 

Also from my experience older women are more likely to casually date than younger. Slightly older women (mid 30-s to mid 40's) tend to have more established lives so they don't get as attached over something casual."

Hard to know what the perfect moment is, but some good steps to take are 1) trying to spend more time with them, 2) not talking about hooking up or dating other people when you're with them, 3) showing them that they're important to you (I don't give my guy friends a birthday present, maybe I'd give her one). Try not going overboard though. May end up in the friend zone.

AskMen,f029tqa,t3_d38f4a,1568326369.0,"I don't care. As long as the level of flirtation isn't extremely disrespectful. And even then I'll simply talk about it later.

This was a major problem in my previous relationship. I was the casual flirter. However, I could barely be close platonic friends with girls without my ex constantly being jealous & talking shit about them. I'd talk to girls when we went out and she'd get pissed off. I'd dance or talk with old female friends of mine and she'd be livid. She tried to compensate by making me jealous in turn, which didn't work because I wasn't a jealous person. So she turned to constantly buying me stuff all the time, which I told her several times was appreciated but unnecessary. As you can guess it turned toxic pretty fast. Got to the point of me feeling annoyed & trapped because there was never any trust. I was far from a perfect boyfriend, but having a girlfriend who constantly thinks you're a cheater and tries to get revenge on you when she feels insecure is exhausting. She was with her ex for over 12 years and I had never been in a relationship, so while she was used to extreme levels of commitment, I was used to none at all and therefore not insecure about this type of thing. She took things fast & serious, I took things slow & casual. VERY bad mix.

Long story short her jealously and paranoia that I was going to cheat made me want to, which ended our relationship. Never slept with another girl but I admit I did fuck up. But she wasn't a completely faithful person either, so I suppose her paranoia adds up."

I realized my dad may be cheating on my mom. This is in the span of barely 2 months.. i tried moving away to where my sister lives but i had to move back because of my arrest. so i was left at home with my parents and no friends to rely on. i made new friends and started making strides but they abandoned me too, likely because of my depression. the job search was going well in the city i moved away to but where im from it was terrible. my uncle nearly died.. eventually i gave up hope. but as i try to pull myself together i have my family on my back making me feel worse about things i already feel bad about. i fell apart and im desperately trying to pull myself together. i know one day it will get better, but right now it's almost too much to handle. and the panic attacks have been multiplying ever since it all started."
