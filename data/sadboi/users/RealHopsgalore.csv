After over four years with said ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù man ...countless fights, holes in walls and windows, him cheating and me running... he still seems to have a hold on me. I haven‚Äôt been able to step away from the relationship. As abusive as it can get he finds a way to bring me back. The idea that this toxic roller coaster is even remotely exciting or intoxicating drive me crazy. In my mind I know I should have been long gone after the first lie..my heart thinks I can still change him. It‚Äôs so frustrating because I know I hold the power to create change. It‚Äôs so hard and I am far from perfect, I want any love regardless of if it‚Äôs toxic or healthy. I have been unhappy but hearing him say he needs me or he can‚Äôt live without me brings me back every time... how do I stop this cycle."

exjw,fngjkjn,t3_g158ua,1586934287.0,"I believe in this sentiment wholeheartedly. The fear inducing environment along with the toxic family dynamics are enough for any young and impressionable child to grow up with one or many mental illnesses /personality disorders. If you were raised in this organization and are finally POMO or PIMO I give you my love and have so much respect for you! The trauma one can experience being in the borg let alone growing up in it, is no joke. 

Coming out we often lack emotionally maturity. We can have a myriad of emotions or thoughts rushing around that we don‚Äôt yet have the skill set to process. Many of us growing up were not able to show or express our truth or our needs. That pill of perfection forced down our throats caused many of us to put all needs on the back burner. Growing up, we were being taught and forced to live solely for the borg under the guise of being seen favorably in Jahs eyes so that we may live forever. That amount of pressure on anyone can be back breaking. Coming out I think it is so important to learn to love and trust again, to learn to trust who you really are. Knowing and accepting WHO you are is a journey in itself as we were often rewarded for being the version of ourselves everyone else wanted. Not trusting that who we really were on the inside was going to be deemed ok or good enough. 

I wish there was a sort of program for ex witnesses who are leaving. Something like a center for those who do suffer from mental illnesses or personality disorders. I know first hand how difficult it can be managing an illness on your own. Learning to process and heal from this kind of trauma is important for any growth. Releasing the lies and stories while again learning to trust your voice. It‚Äôs a long journey but a rewarding one at that 

Sending love to you all."

Once completed they are driven to the hospital within the half hour. We have someone on staff meet us with a trolley and they take the boxes away, minimal contact in every aspect. People buy and consume ready to eat product every day from Starbucks to Trader Joe‚Äôs. No different than any fast food or quick service restaurant.
