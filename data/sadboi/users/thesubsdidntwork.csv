He‚Äôs been doing this same thing (leaving me on seen and just not putting any effort into the conversation) for over a year now.. i cant even count how many times i‚Äôve tried to get him to understand. He knows i have BPD and has been more understanding than most people, he tries his best to reassure me and then the next minute does the same thing that made me feel insecure. :/ thank you for reassuring me im not crazy for feeling like this. 
edit; another thing i do want to add is sometimes he can be really pushy initiating sex. i‚Äôll say no and he‚Äôll pout and keep asking me why while also saying ‚Äúnot that you need a reason to say no‚Äù. sometimes i just give in after the 3rd or 4th time he tries but i never saw this as something wrong, i guess because i have been in a few non consensual situations when i was a child so it doesn‚Äôt feel as horrible since i said okay. typing it out, though is making me feel differently."

My phone was dead, it was dark and I was waiting on a friend to pick me up while I walked towards town (20 miles). I see headlights approaching from the opposite way and they started slowing as they got closer. I remember my stomach filling with knots. It was a white pick up truck, two guys were in the front seat. The one guy in the window closest to me leaned out and started talking to me in spanish. I could tell by the tone of his voice and body language I was being cat called, or something close to it. I started walking away and tried not to make eye contact, but the dude driving kept backing up to follow my speed. Eventually he gave up and took off. It was really terrifying for me as a 15 year old girl (and sexual violence survivor), with no phone, and knowing my mom was a few miles away unable to help me if something went wrong.

When I was in high school and went vegan for the first time (an excuse to eat lower caloric foods without being questioned by family, and have control over my meals) I was extremely paranoid about cross contamination of high fat and high calorie foods, especially meat products. I could absolutely be reading too deep into it, I don‚Äôt know your daughter, and being vegan is a great lifestyle. I just know how I used to rationalize my extreme veganism to keep my ED a secret."

My subscription is active until November , my account is signed in and my internet is working so i‚Äôm super pissed. I talked to customer support and she had me delete the game i was initially trying to play (Fallout NV) and now it (and every other game i had free with gold) says i have to pay full price. 
Microsoft is fucked man. 
Even if FNV wasn‚Äôt free with gold wouldn‚Äôt i have stopped being able to play it whenever that happened?? I had Red Dead Redemption (which I know for a fact is free with gold), decided to uninstall it to see if it would let me reinstall, and that too was going to make me pay full price. They won‚Äôt even fucking help me. The reason I even got gold was because that‚Äôs the only money I have for leisure each month and it felt like a better deal rather than paying $20+ for each individual game. So ridiculous dude im so pissed. 

Sorry im just kinda ranting at this point but let me know if this has ever happened to anyone else and if they‚Äôve helped you out. And I know FNV is only $15 but I‚Äôm in a really shit financial situation right now and really cannot spend any extra money than I already am.
