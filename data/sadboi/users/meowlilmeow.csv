BipolarReddit,fpd2ssa,t3_gcrsy7,1588518631.0,"I agree with these, I think that acting healthy and active goes a long way in making one healthy and active so that entails getting good sleep and physical hygiene, eating well, working out, educating yourself about things that you‚Äôre passionate about often also goes a long way in helping one feel productive which me personally helps me feel content and not slip into negative thinking."
TalkTherapy,fp3ntgk,t3_gayt6p,1588282598.0,"Definitely trust the process, as long as your t seems good and not the problem that is. Therapy used to make me really anxious so I would bring a stuffed animal with me (and yes I am a full grown adult) try holding something or lighting something like a candle! That comforts you during therapy and see if the anxiety improves at all."

BipolarReddit,fnzljae,t1_fnzl2ex,1587396368.0,"Definitely don‚Äôt feel mad at yourself for being depressed. Also, you can be very stable while on meds and still get mildly depressed after all most people get depressed once in awhile especially during these hard times so don‚Äôt be hard on yourself for feeling atypical when actually what you‚Äôre feeling is very typical 
Something that I‚Äôve had to come to terms with is that bipolar has fundamentally changed my brain so I will never be ‚Äú100% normal‚Äù and i actually like that, I think it‚Äôs good to be different and interesting, besides the fact that no one is actually normal.  Hope this helps!"
BipolarReddit,fnzjszm,t3_g4u8f1,1587395435.0,"While you shouldn‚Äôt expect to be forever completely stable, I think that if you are on meds and keeping a good sleep and food hygiene then you can expect to have fewer and more mild episodes for sure!"

BipolarReddit,fnz3r0f,t3_g4q9il,1587385221.0,"What the other person said is true but also it differs for everyone...I‚Äôve been on meds for a year and haven‚Äôt had any major episodes since then (just a couple light dips for less than a week). IMO a huge part of my stability has to do with good sleep and food hygiene so try to that, take your meds regularly and hopefully you‚Äôll get to stay relatively stable. Best of luck my friend"

That being said I can understand how some people with bp have children especially if that‚Äôs their only issue."

BipolarReddit,fmfwv3f,t3_fuyeks,1586036524.0,"Mental health care is extremely personal. I would tell her that you would like her to seek care but aren‚Äôt going to force her (and then make sure you don‚Äôt). But make it clear that you are willing to help as much as possible. Definitely don‚Äôt do anything behind her back and unfortunately she‚Äôll probably have a bad episode in order to get help. Be aware that bipolar moods only cycle about every 4 days to a week (in fast cycling) and up to several months or years; however, borderline personality disorder is likely to have swings that change throughout the day but other than that they share a lost of surface level symptoms."

BipolarReddit,filhud8,t3_f8hcee,1582501927.0,I know this might not be the best but for me whenever I get upset about someone being late or missing something is remembering how I felt during my depressed days and how hard it was to do things or when I was hypomanic and would just forget appointments.

BipolarReddit,fil6dkz,t3_f8fyxh,1582494622.0,"First off, hey you can do this, hang in there! Second, relationships can be very triggering for bipolar because they are yet another thing to take care of and require a lot of mental power especially during hypomanic/manic periods when anxiety is high or during depressive episodes when you might feel compelled to leave or neglect friends because ‚Äúeverybody must hate me.‚Äù I personally don‚Äôt find friendships triggering but romantic relationships can be very strange as I tend to get so anxious that I start presenting with hypomania whenever I see my so. Third of all, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre a sociopath, it‚Äôs probably just a lot of self hate that‚Äôs developed over the years. I hope that you can break those habits of self harm and remember to take your meds and have a regular sleep schedule and you can do it!"
