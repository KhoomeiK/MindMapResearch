I'm not military but LEO. Had my share of critical incidents over the years. Mass shootings, horrific car wrecks, fighting for my life, etc. It never really goes away but I've found what works for me is to more or less to accept that if happened and that there's nothing I can do to change that. I also just switch if off as much as I can.  I try and focus on who I was before I put on a uniform and try to be that person. Sometimes I need to pretend and slap on a happy face but it still beats the alternative which is neverending feelings of shittiness. When I feel myself starting to sink down into feelings of despair I lock it down. Full stop.  I count to ten and I tell myself ""nope. Not happening."" And then focus on the task at hand even if it's something menial like grocery shopping or sweeping a floor. 

It's also a real weird fix for me but that show Futurama. Always makes me feel better. Always makes me feel safe. Seen the entire run about 10 times over. Even if it's just background noise. 

Life can be pretty grim especially if you've stared the shit right in the face. But there's also sunny days, cold beers with friends, laughing your ass off at funny jokes and good times before any of this ever happened. 

I've got my phone on me all the time. Message me on here if you're ever in need. I'll answer within 6-7 hours at the latest. I sleep during the day since I'm on graveyards. 2200-0800 EST.
