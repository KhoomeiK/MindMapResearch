depression,fr1ojab,t3_glueb5,1589823282.0,"I feel you on this. Sometimes the idea of death scares me and sometimes I wish for it. My mom has told me several times throughout my life that if I die, she will kill herself. To her credit, it's the first thing I think about whenever I think about suicide. My dad would be devastated too, even though he's never said it. My boyfriend would be hurt but he would be fine. He'd just move to another city and start over. My best friend would be devastated, so there's that. 

My parents are older, so I think once they're gone, I'll pull the plug too if my life continues to feel like a complete waste."

rant,fprv6z7,t3_gf7cxv,1588862667.0,"I'll admit when I read the title of this post I was worried for your impending replies, but I think what you're experiencing has a lot to do with the inferno that is social media. You've acknowledged your privilege, which means you're leaps and bounds ahead of other white people, and I'm saying that as as white person myself. There are just certain conversations involving race that we won't be invited to participate in. And because of our white privilege, we won't have much to contribute anyway.

The problem with most people on social media is generalization and thinking in absolutes. All creeds and races of people have the ability to be shitty humans. White people have a fairly garbage track record in general, but when people jump to ""all white people are shit"", they're no better than people who claim ""all black/latinix/asian/etc people are shit"". Like you said, when you experience enough of the polarization, it's easy for a lot of people to go, ""fuck it. they hate me so I hate them"". But that only plays into the generalization of it all.

Social media can be fun and even informative...but it can also be a vapid shits show."

I realize that this kind of situation would cater to the uninformed and I don't really enjoy that aspect, but would this do anything to unite people?
