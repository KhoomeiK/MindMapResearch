SuicideWatch,fcu6fuv,t3_eiy2oy,1577973688.0,"I love this topic. There are so many theories and opinions.

For me, there is no ""consciousness of being unconscious"". Think about a dreamless sleep. Time can pass so incredibly quickly. Because we aren't aware that we're asleep, usually that time can pass almost instantly.

Think about how you've always felt like you've been here. When you were born, when you had your first memory, did it feel like you knew were incarnated into this world? Probably not.

Where does that consciousness come from? At least, in theory, billions of years passed before you were born and you never had to wait for that, so an infinite amount of time can pass after you die in an instant. And I just don't think, with having zero consciousness of the unconscious, that you can die. 

I'm getting kind of spiritual here I guess, but I genuinely believe that you will always be conscious, but you might not ever be aware of your past lives. The brain is your filter for consciousness. There is no real ""you"". 

So I do believe in some kind of reincarnation/rebirth and multiverse. I subscribe to any theory that involves afterlife because I think it's impossible to just not exist.

A lot of it is perception. Because you are aware of time passing as you are alive and awake, then things move at regular speed. Die and you basically travel through time. So maybe we're all living in our own universes at our own speeds/perception. Because it's weird to picture everyone's timelines moving at the exact same speed for everyone (from my perspective)."
