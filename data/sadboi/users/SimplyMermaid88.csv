I'm personally much happier since I started shaving, but I have more hair than you. I looked similar to yours at the beginning way before shaving, but it quickly became unmanageable. 
Shaving doesn't work for everyone. It works for me. 

If your curious, I use Kiss my face face shaving cream. It's lavader scented and smells and feels much better than the shaving cream for legs. I can't remember what razor I use though.  I just know it's pink and I think it has to do with Shea Butter."
