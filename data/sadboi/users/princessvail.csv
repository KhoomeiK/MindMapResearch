AmItheAsshole,fqwxs6e,t3_gla3kq,1589720766.0,"NTA as someone who has a very close size (40H UK) I have been shamed almost all my life for my chest. This shaming started when I was a child and I am to the point where I am saving up for top surgery to have my breast fully removed. 
So dont let anyone shame you for that its part of your body and the bras are necessary. There is no reason you need to dry them out anywhere but the laundry room. Maybe let your flatmate in on how much each of them cost and how necessary they are to ypur well being. And that her bf is hella creepy and yucky to be touching them in the first place."

Our commitment vows were about that actually and that we are committed to being a unit no matter what although we don't have a blue print of what that looks like. We know it changes and we are polyamorous and know people will come and go and hope for each other is for either of us to find others if thats what makes us happy. We will find the space in our home.
