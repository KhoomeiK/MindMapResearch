dating_advice,fl1k4hz,t1_fl1iodc,1584730589.0,"19 hours.

No, 3 months ago she ghosted me because she was dating someone else.

When she broke up with him SHE texted me, but also ghosted me after.

Met her at a party saturday, made out for more than an hour. After that she texted me saying we should hang out, but this Corona thing messed things up. I tried to keep in touch just to maintain some connection (I have nothing to do in this quarantine, so why not just have a conversation with her?) but she ghosted me again.

I just can't understand it."

Think I will try it anyways. Thanks!!"

depression,fkpc7a2,t3_fjthj0,1584406664.0,"This crisis won't last forever... Don't let it discourage you, do some push ups and pull ups everyday at home, start runniong a few times a week, and when the world gets normal again do the things you were planning to do before..

Don't give up now or you will regret it later. Good luck!"
dating,fkolcay,t1_fkof3ua,1584389502.0,"I was drunk and sad when I wrote this. Idk the guy. I can only tell he is probably a 6/10 in looks and I'm an 8/10... thats all I meant

What do you mean by ""shitty ideas"" ?? And what should I focus on to avoid this type of things from happening again?"
depression,fkjirc3,t3_fisv89,1584247191.0,"Man, I really don't know if I can help you, bu I'll try anyways..

I'm 20yo... struggling with depression and anxiety... just saw the girl I like going home with another guy 40 minutes ago.

Life just sucks sometimes... I try to become the best version of myself everyday, even then things just doesn't seem to work out the way I wanted to..

Pls, just give it another try, DONT CONDITION YOUR JOY ON THINGS YOU DONT HAVE CONTROL OVER.. If a girl rejects you, forget about her

YOU can get in shape, YOU can get a better job, YOU can study and be more intelligent, whatever...

 Focus on the things YOU can control

Give your life another chance, try to make your life a little bit better everyday...

It won't be easy, but always remember there were people that felt the same things you feel right now, and they achieved a life worth living, so... just try..."
Advice,fdtukcc,t3_en1sdp,1578722440.0,"Yes, Therapy would be good for you. 

You need to find something meaningful to fight for. Something that you will enjoy doing (work/professional life) and pursue that until the end.

Also, go to the gym, work on yourself (body, style, whatever). Try to become the best version of yourself  everyday and things will start working out for you. Trust me.

PS: Search for Jordan Peterson on youtube. He helped me a lot. 

Find your purpose! 

Good luck!"
dating_advice,fbikhik,t1_fbije78,1576903765.0,"You said you focused on improving yourself... add something to that list: talk to people!

I know how you fell man. But I try everyday to confront the things that make me anxious. You need to do that as well.

 Go to the gym. Work on your style and on what you wanna do in life. Try to become the best version of yourself and you will feel more confident naturally.

Also, face your fears and what makes you nervous and anxious. Thats the only way I know. Thats what I started doing when I was at your age (I'm 20 now) and it works. Trust me."
dating_advice,fbij26g,t3_edk6no,1576902497.0,"If you aren't social, there is only one way to fix this... go out there and talk to people. Force yourself to do it.

Pay attention to what people are saying, ask questions.

There is no easy way.... thats a long path, but it works. Trust me."
dating_advice,fbctavz,t3_ecd3r5,1576733153.0,"Yes, she is interested. Trust me. Talk to her again in person and ask for her number, or just start talking trough instagram. 

Dont wait too much to make a move. 

Dont just say u like her. Start talking naturally and then ask her to hang out.

Good luck"
dating_advice,fbbvgj6,t1_fbbbk80,1576709040.0,"So, are you just going to stay there arguing about how life and the universe were unfair with you ?

That is not a good move, and it will only bring more sadness and resentment.

Go to the gym, work on your style and in your carreer.  Try to become the best version of yourself and people will feel attracted to you. Trust me."
dating_advice,fbbtkmo,t3_ecg038,1576707834.0,"Thats right, don't ask her if she likes you or not. If you feel like you guys have some kind of connection (u said u guys flirt a lot) just ask her out and see how she reacts.

Good Luck"
dating,fbbsg6b,t3_ec5aoj,1576707112.0,"If you don't talk to her she will probably think you lost interest.... but don't act desperate as well.

Text her sometimes, ask about the trip, and then tell her to hit you up when she's back in town. If she does, go for the date.

Hope that helps. Good luck"
dating,fbbejyj,t3_ec7rbx,1576698805.0,"Yeah dude, I know how you feel, it sucks, I'm going trough something like that rn. I just stopped messaging her, and I think you should do the same.

If she doesn't want to gou out with you rn , don't contact her for a while, give it a break. Maybe she lost interest in you or maybe she is dating someone else too. But anyways, if you really like this girl, wait a couple of weeks (3-4) and hit her up again like nothing happened... That worked for me in the past

And thats what I'm going to do too... hope it helps. Good luck"
dating,fb9tbl1,t1_fb9rvmg,1576649081.0,"Sorry, I didn't understand... what do you mean by dont worry about it ?"
dating,fb9pfw9,t1_fb8j28n,1576645254.0,"I don't really get to see her that much. Thats why I asked if I should hit her up, because that may be the only way we could get in contact again, otherwise chances are I'm only going to talk to her again at another ramdom party in the future. And I really dont want to count on that..."
dating,fb9ofrq,t1_fb8n9tz,1576644338.0,"I just left her message on read...

But honestly, based on your experiences what are the chances of her contacting me in the future (4-8 weeks)?

And if that doesn't happen, should I contact her ?"
dating_advice,fb9ig6v,t1_fb887y7,1576639433.0,"Idk man, I may appear a little bit desperate or needy if tell her that. I didn't reply and let her message on read

Don't know if that was the right move but i did it

In your opinion and experience, what are the chances of her contacting me again ? And if she doesn't, should I contact her in the future (like 4-5 weeks) ?"
dating_advice,fb8sg2s,t1_fb8jnri,1576620850.0,"Yeah, that feeling sucks, and not being able to fix the situation makes it worse. But I'll get over it.

Well,  I guess that's it... For now I have some other girls who I can talk and maybe get dates with, so I will do that. I did what you said and left it on read... maybe I'll conctact her again in a couple of weeks and see what happens haha

Thank you very much for the advice man, I really needed that!"
dating,fb8ivm3,t1_fb8f4n8,1576614905.0,"I think I will just left her on read... telling her to let me know if things fall apart can sound a bit needy in this situation

Do you think I should to contact her sometime in the future (like 1-2 months from now) ? Or should I just disappear and never talk to her again ?"
dating,fb8i5v0,t1_fb8f7ux,1576614474.0,"Do you think it might be a ""shit test"" or something like that ? 

And should I contact her sometime in the future ?"
dating_advice,fb8drv4,t1_fb8944r,1576611721.0,"Idk man, I had a really good time with this girl and I enjoyed talking to her (I rarely feel that way so fast). I don't want to create any expectations, but I would like to see her again sometime. The thing is I don't  know if there is something I can do for this to happen. If I just ignore her and disappear I dont think she will reach out. Maybe I should just walk way and then hit her up in the future. What do you think ?

Sorry to bother you man, but I'm really confused and it looks like you have more experience than me in this type of thing haha"
