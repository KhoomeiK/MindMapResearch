Personally with having a brother whose been through a lot and knowing how violent people can become, in the initial moment I think there's a lot of validity to letting Kenny have peace with a bullet. Doing a vanilla run with no spoilers, it makes sense, because there's no guarantee his outbursts wouldn't have gotten worse. I know he loves Clem but sometimes we hurt the ones we love in the moment. Plus it's very clear he wanted death. I sure as shit would, and in a way I'd rather it be at the hands of a loved one then anything though that's also unfair to ask of them as it leaves them with a great weight.

That said I haven't seen any scenes of him living, I intend to for my next playthrough and I look very forward to it. That scene with Kenny and Jane was probably the hardest choice in the entire franchise for me to make and it took a great deal of thought."

You know like PQ but...uh...relevant. There's 0 reason that Yu's biggest feats (beating Elizabeth and Aigis) should have been in Arena. There's also 0 reason why Elizabeth finding her answer to saving Minato should've been in a spin-off and STILL hasn't come to fruition yet.

As a user above said I think Yu really is more efficient at utilizing and switching Persona's on the fly, especially given the themes of bonds and friendships that were hammered home, while Minato is just an absolute powerhouse beast.
