UKPersonalFinance,fk5pf81,t3_fg9p03,1583885273.0,"It’s brilliant. I haven’t paid more than 50% of my phone bill for a few months now thanks to AR.

Saving around £40/£45 a month!"
Anxiety,fk5o52q,t3_fghb3j,1583884527.0,I’m proud of you
UKPersonalFinance,fhs1kb2,t1_fhrqx5e,1581849206.0,"My mortgage is already in place, I can’t move in until August/September because the house hasn’t been built yet, it’s a new build. 

Deposit, fees and other costs are already in another savings pot. The £3k I have spare is literally spare money I’ve said for a rainy day. 

I’ll look at BT, thanks for your advice"
Anxiety,fhcgyoi,t1_fhcggqj,1581462833.0,"That’s amazing and I’m so happy you’ve found a way to help you and I hope it continues, I’m hoping I receive the same reception! Honestly, my shoulders have relaxed so much just by reading experiences, knowing I’m not stupid or a time waster really makes me feel good."
Anxiety,fhcg9a3,t1_fhcdfje,1581462473.0,"That’s the hardest.  It’s not a chesty cough or a rash on my arm. It’s all mental and I feel weird talking about “something that is not there”! Thank you for your pointers, I really do appreciate you taking the time to support me. For once, I’m proud of myself for booking the appointment and I genuinely can’t wait for the relief after I’ve attended. Thank you so much."
Anxiety,fhcg0gt,t1_fhcd9q3,1581462342.0,"Thank you ever so much! It just feels weird that I’m going to talk about a mental illness rather than oh, my ankle is sprained or my cough is bad and instantly having the proof there. Thank you though, we’ll get through this together"
Anxiety,fhcftbh,t1_fhc9c3v,1581462240.0,"Thank you, I’ll get through it, somehow!"
Anxiety,fhcfpj1,t1_fhc7dd9,1581462187.0,"Thank you so much. I feel somewhat relieved to hear that somebody else in this big world knows what I’m going through and I thank you for it. Thank you for being proud, that certainly means a lot. I’m going to do my best tomorrow and think of the more positive weeks to come, thank you so much"
Cinemagraphs,fhc6eh5,t3_f25vxt,1581457132.0,Tranquil. Beautiful.
