The more comfortable I become with the parts of myself that may be more “boring” the more I’ve been able to get back to those wacky parts too. 

I hope you find a good balance soon 🌷"

I’m happy for the people who post about paying off their debt, and it’s great to see that kind of representation for those in similar situations. But I think most of us are not in that position, and a percentage of those who are, are only there because it’s tax season.

I understand maybe not many people on this sub have listened to those albums, but without the context of all of those albums to compare how can *anyone* choose who they want to win? Personally, I’m rooting for Bon Iver because i,i was a beautiful piece of art.

BipolarReddit,ffm6lhy,t3_eu62o5,1580049335.0,"
I was 18, in my last semester of high school. My dad and I had grown close snd I just bit the bullet one night on the way home from dinner - “Dad, I want to kill myself and I have for a long time.” He thought for a minute and said, “You should talk to someone about that.” So he helped me set up my first therapy appointment.

At first I was just diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but I think the more I spoke to my therapist the more she saw it was something else. We talked about emotional intelligence a lot, and feeling things so much I couldn’t help but react, and spending money recklessly, and self destruction...it took about 2 months of weekly visits for them to diagnose me with bipolar disorder 1 and write a prescription for lamotrigine.

I was manic at the time of diagnosis but did not recognize it as such. I don’t think a particular episode got me diagnosed, but more the small details I would share in therapy, little context clues I guess."

The shame of it all used to cripple me, I was always trying to shrink myself and disappear. 2019 was the first time I really said, “Fuck that,” and have been vocal about my struggles with mental illness, judgements be damned. Through that vulnerability I have made the most meaningful connections. Maybe sugar daddies don’t want me, but I want myself and I think that’s something. 

Proud of you for the ownership you’re taking here. You’re a a strong independent person and have the power to manage your illness and life on your own terms - how liberating."

For me, stability doesn’t mean I’m numb or static or “in the middle.” My mood still fluctuates and I occasionally have some pretty intrusive thoughts but stability means I approach those fluctuations and thoughts with rationality, patience, compassion, and healthy coping mechanisms. I still feel a range of emotion, but I’m able to sort through the more extreme emotions and come down from them, ride the wave so to speak. Ups and downs still happen, on a smaller scale, and I am capable of using the tools I have to help myself."

She doesn’t say, “I felt your heart beat,” she says, “The beat of your heart jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms.” And you are there, with the one
 *you* love, feeling their heart beat.

When I remember my past, particularly the people I have loved, I remember them in flashes of intense details.

Weed straight from a dispensary gives you a lot better idea of what kind of effects it will have on you — will it make you calm and peaceful or energetic and wild? That way you can control the type of high you’re getting - to be calm when you’re anxious/manic or to get some energy if you’re depressed.

BipolarReddit,ewlee6w,t3_coukvq,1565520124.0,"It works for me.

For me it has helped introduce healthy coping strategies and thought processes to manage my emotions. I’ve learned my triggers and how to work through mania and depression when they do come to visit so neither state feels so extreme—I am still able to function even on days I don’t think I can. It’s also helped me dig through my childhood/adolescence/past in general and address the traumas that have occurred so they don’t heavily impact the way I live my life currently.

At my “worst” I was going twice a week. Now that I am pretty stable I go every few weeks to check in, but I still find it worth my time and effort. 

You mentioned group therapy, which I think is very different than individual DBT or CBT therapy. If you’re struggling and finding group therapy unhelpful, but are open to other forms of therapy, I would highly recommend at least a few sessions with a therapist one on one."
