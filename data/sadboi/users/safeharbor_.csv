I was 18, in my last semester of high school. My dad and I had grown close snd I just bit the bullet one night on the way home from dinner - ‚ÄúDad, I want to kill myself and I have for a long time.‚Äù He thought for a minute and said, ‚ÄúYou should talk to someone about that.‚Äù So he helped me set up my first therapy appointment.

At first I was just diagnosed with anxiety and depression, but I think the more I spoke to my therapist the more she saw it was something else. We talked about emotional intelligence a lot, and feeling things so much I couldn‚Äôt help but react, and spending money recklessly, and self destruction...it took about 2 months of weekly visits for them to diagnose me with bipolar disorder 1 and write a prescription for lamotrigine.

I was manic at the time of diagnosis but did not recognize it as such. I don‚Äôt think a particular episode got me diagnosed, but more the small details I would share in therapy, little context clues I guess."
