My personal favorite that I saw happen live is [Jason Kubel's grand-slam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewExNzan1TM) on 6/13/2006 to beat the Red Sox in the bottom of the 9th.

This one has always stuck with me because of Dick Bremer's voice (which is already great in these situations). The video cuts out part of his dialogue, but he didn't think the ball was going out until the very last moment.

""Three and two to Kubel. High fly, right field. Nixon retreats, Cuddyer will tag. This baallll is.......GOOOONE A GRAND SLAM FOR JASON KUBEL""

This was also a memorable moment in the season as the Twins had been underperforming up to this point and were falling behind Detroit in the division race. With a record of 28-34 entering this game, the Twins would go 68-32 the rest of the season and finish a game ahead of the Tigers for the Central Division title."
