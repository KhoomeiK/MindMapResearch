It’s my understanding that bacteria in the gut compete with yeast for territory.  Both the yeast and bacteria release chemicals that inhibit the other.  After antibiotics kill off bacteria the yeast is left unencumbered to spread.  

It seems to me that if we can kill the yeast and keep it suppressed for a long enough time that the regular intestinal flora (bacteria) can regrow to such an extent that it has the advantage it then should naturally resist a yeast overgrowth.  

So while I’m taking Nystatin powder I’m also avoiding anything that could potentially harm bacteria or slow there growth and eating a diet that encourages the flourishing of healthy bacteria.

I would think that if someone killed off the Candida to a large enough degree and kept it that way for a long enough time to allow the gut microbiome to stabilize with sufficient good bacteria as to be resistant to further Candida overgrowth and as long as everything else is working properly especially motility and the migrating motor complex then I would think that as long as the diet encourages healthy intestinal bacteria then some carbs or general variety shouldn’t be a problem, but I don’t have clinical experience treating it so I don’t know.

I’ve got a doctors visit coming up and I expect to get a prescription for nystatin.  It’s my understanding that it only effects the digestive system

Also I’ll be starting a new antifungal diet “feast without yeast” but I haven’t gotten the book yet to really know the details.  I think it’s a gluten and dairy free diet and also excludes all malt and vinegar.  I plan on posting about it after I give it some time.

Anyhow I’ve heard one doctor say he does nystatin for 3 months typically one said 6 months depending on severity and I even heard one say that it’s gentle enough to even prescribe for as long as a year.  

I think if I can keep the yeast under control for 4 or 5 months the microbiome should balance out with enough healthy flora/bacteria to resist another yeast overgrowth.  

I tried nearly every natural method so far without any luck.  The undecylenic acid did help some and perhaps would eventually fix this but maybe not, I couldn’t find much info on it.  I may continue taking it later on.

POIS,fk5aq8y,t1_fk4cxwh,1583876765.0,"It depends on what’s causing it.  Some people tend to have more permeability naturally than others do.  So they’ll be more sensitive to things that cause it.  

Gluten for example increases intestinal permeability in everyone but some people are far more sensitive since they had more permeability to begin with.  Iirc lectins can attribute to it,  Intestinal yeast infection(sifo) can cause it as can inflammation.  

Intestinal yeast can morph from its yeast state into a hyphae state.  Hyphae can send out something like roots that can penetrate the small intestinal wall.

Anyone who’s taken antibiotics could potentially have yeast over growth.  In the gut yeast and bacteria compete for territory.  Many bacteria produce chemicals or vitamins that prevent the yeast from getting out of control.  Antibiotics can kill these bacteria allowing the yeast to spread unrestricted.  Add to this a high sugar diet and it’s a recipe for disaster.  

There are a lot of potential causes here and many variables but for me personally I was healthy and I had no POIS and then I developed a combination of sibo and sifo and with it a myriad of problems including POIS. 

At one point it caused my iron to drop really low.  Low iron can cause excessively high catecholamine levels which then cause receptor down regulation, low dopamine symptoms and high adrenaline symptoms.  While getting my iron up helped tremendously it wasn’t the whole problem.  

Adequate iron is also required for optimum thyroid function.  Low thyroid function can cause excessively high cortisol levels and low dopamine.  

Just to be safe I do not recommend anyone supplement iron without getting your ferritin tested beforehand.  I’m about to recheck mine and I’m aiming for serum ferritin in the 70-100 range.  

Anyhow it is very complex but it all starts in the gut and if someone’s digestion is off my advise is to address that first.  

I used to think that sibo was my main problem but after some testing and talking to a couple doctors I now believe that for me personally the root cause is an intestinal yeast infection that is causing all of my problems including POIS.

I think it’s an autoimmune condition caused by intestinal permeability, at least in my case.  

The thing is when digestion is off there’s a cascade of problems that are compounded the longer it goes on.  First you may get iron or zinc deficiency, then that throws of your neurotransmitters and hormones, then your thyroid and metabolism act up, now you may not sleep well, stress builds up causing insulin and cortisol resistance and so on.  

Then a standard medical doctor will give a drug to treat each individual symptom without looking at the whole, the cause."
SIBO,fjzpmi4,t1_fjzfb3v,1583725658.0,"The b vitamins will help your body create the enzymes needed to process acetaldehyde but they would only be treating the symptom not the cause if in fact this is the case. 

Although there is substantial evidence for sifo and yeast overgrowth most mainstream md’s will not acknowledge 
this possibility.  

I would be hesitant to take more antibiotics without accompanying antifungals.  You very well may benefit more from a course of nystatin or undecylenic acid(sf722) which would kill yeast in the digestive tract.  Taking more antibiotics on there own is playing with fire in my opinion.  

Yeast/Candida has also been shown to morph from its yeast form into a hyphae form which is more aggressive, in this form it has something like roots it puts down which inside the small intestine can cause intestinal permeability(leaky gut) once this happens you get weird autoimmune symptoms and systemic inflammation.  Yeast has been shown to cross the bbb(blood brain barrier) and cause mental fogginess and depression.  

Also acetaldehyde can bind to dopamine and cause low moods as well.  

Undecylenic acid has been shown to revert the hyphae back into it’s less aggressive yeast state.  

I know this is a lot to process.  Lmk if you have more questions.

SIBO,fjxvhhg,t3_ffcreb,1583684301.0,"I am personally very worried about this sub.  I’m going to write a post about it soon.  

It’s my understanding that within the gut bacteria and yeast compete for territory and nutrition.  Some bacteria even release antifungal agents and vitamins.  

When a person takes antibiotics to specifically kill off bacteria the yeast is then left unencumbered to spread and multiply.  

Sifo (small intestine fungal overgrowth) has nearly identical symptoms as sibo.  

Now if you’ve got sifo and have been on antibiotics you’ve got the dual problem of lowering yeast counts, killing off small intestinal yeast and reestablishing beneficial bacteria.  

In my opinion an antifungal treatment should be used in conjunction with antibiotics in order to help maintain balance within the system.  

If you’re curious about sifo you could get an organic acid test.  Iirc one of the markers for high yeast levels is arabinose.

Another thing excessive yeast can cause is high acetaldehyde levels.  Check symptoms for that.  Acetaldehyde uses up certain enzymes that process histamine so you can see a histamine intolerance as well.  I realized this was an issue when I had a severe reaction to canned tuna/mackerel which didn’t add up at first because they’re just meat, but they’re both high in histamines.    
 
Also for example I hadn’t drank alcohol for three years due to sibo/sifo.  After antibiotic herbals I thought I’d drink some white wine just to see if I had improved and could maybe tolerate it.  Little did I know white wine is high in acetaldehyde and I was sick/hungover for literally 7 days.  

Acetaldehyde is the same chemical that is produced when your body processes alcohol, so my liver was overwhelmed and the enzymes used to process it were already used up.  

Acetaldehyde also uses up enzymes that process stress hormones, potentially leaving people overly stressed.

The cofactors for the enzyme required to process acetaldehyde are thiamine(b1) and niacin (b3) And riboflavin(b2)

These are just a few things to think about.

Candida,fjxqpjf,t3_ff7xru,1583681075.0,"I have been thinking the same thing.  I’ve had sibo and sifo and the sibo specialists are now saying that eating some carbs, fiber and prebiotics feed the bacteria and when they’re fed they’re easier to kill.  I think the same reasoning also applies to yeast/hyphae.  

I went no carb for two years and as soon as I ate carbs all the symptoms came right back, instant flair up, actually I was more sensitive.  

If you don’t have sibo I would think that the best diet against Candida would be a diet that helps beneficial bacteria to flourish because ultimately they’re what is going to prevent a relapse of Candida overgrowth down the road."

The larger ring helped Joshua be elusive and out point Andy from the outside with his significant reach advantage.

I think that if Joshua would have engaged with Andy, even extra fat Andy he would have likely got sparked again. 

Wilder has no inside game and doesn’t do well with pressure.  Andy took some brutal punches from Joshua especially that right hand after his knockdown and I don’t think Wilder hits much harder than Joshua if any.

50+lbs 11” height and 14” reach on iron Mike, there’s a reason for weight classes, they would very likely be way too small."
Boxing,fiowyra,t3_f8r1ny,1582592943.0,"Fury is just way too big for most past heavyweights.  
He was a tough fight before with his size, chin, heart and slick style but now having power too a fully switched On Fury is a Monster.  

Fury would have 6 inches of height 7” of reach and 70lbs on a young prime Ali and be almost a foot taller than iron mike and have 50lbs and a 14” reach advantage. 

Like another poster said Lennox, anyone has trouble with prime Lennox.  

I rank Vitali very highly as well but Fury would have 7” reach and probably be too elusive and would likely skate to a decision win.  

I doubt Joshua has the chin for this new hard pinching version of Fury.  

Outside of Lennox no one comes to mind but with that being said you never know when some unlikely guy just has his number, there’s always someone."

I’d expect AJ to have an advantage in a small ring working in the pocket with his superior inside game and combinations but I’d give Fury or Wilder the edge in a large 24’ ring working at range.  

Just the opposite of my thoughts on AJ vs Ruiz, the first fight in an 18’ ring Ruiz was too much too close but the rematch in a 22’ ring and with his reach advantage was no contest.  

Fury vs Wilder 1 was in a 20 ft ring I think, 
Anyone know the ring size for the rematch?"

SIBO,fi92nf7,t1_fi8ahho,1582254110.0,"There is evidence showing that food poisoning can cause sibo by slowing the mmc(migrating motor complex) which is why prokinetics are oftentimes recommended for sibo.  

I wouldn’t continue seeing any doc that prescribed ppis/anti-acids personally.  I’d either get a referral to see a gastroenterologist that treats sibo and get testing to confirm or find a Naturalpathic doc to work with.  Some will work with you remotely if there are none in your area.  

In the meantime it sounds like the best thing to do is focus on lowering your stress level.  

Staying hydrated helps to keep stress hormones(cortisol) down.  

As another poster mentioned magnesium helps, magnesium glycinate, taurate or natural calm.  

I find a 3 gram dose of taurine very relaxing and it’s relatively inexpensive.  

Getting plenty of rest is always going to help.  

Don’t go too long without eating since this can increase stress hormones(cortisol)

Perhaps try a low fodmap diet in the meantime to see if that helps lessen your symptoms.  

If you’re having any constipation I highly recommend dr shulze intestinal formulae number 1- it’s got ginger in it that works as a prokinetic and generally helps me to not feel bloated.  

Just my thoughts, hope things improve for you soon."

SIBO,fhbuqfd,t1_fhbpdoy,1581450293.0,"I’ve been suffering with sibo/sifo for just over nine years now, during this time I’ve done countless hours of research and experimented quite a bit. 

Awhile back I tried Undecylenic acid which really helped lessen the severity of my symptoms, belching, nausea, fatigue, bloating, acne ect but it didn’t cure me.  

This could have been because I didn’t take it long enough or because it helped the sifo and not the sibo.  

Anyhow after my latest course of antibiotics I improved a little but still show symptoms of very high acetaldehyde so I’m pretty confident it’s mostly fungal at this point.  

I’m trying a different combo of non prescription antifungals,prokinetics and probiotics right now.  

I’m also journaling everything as I go so when I do overcome this illness I can share it here."
SIBO,fhbnunk,t3_f0w7jh,1581446129.0,"Maybe it’s more so sifo than sibo?  

Also Candida/yeast and bacteria compete in the gut so when people take antibiotics they kill off the main competition of the yeast so it can more easily overgrow further.  

I think anti-fungals should be used in conjunction with antibiotics for this reason.  

My tests showed overgrowth of both bacteria and fungus and I show signs of acetaldehyde toxicity which I believe to be the result of yeast overgrowth.  

I just did a long grueling course of antibiotics which helped some but I’m starting to think yeast is the main problem for me personally so I started an antifungal regimen yesterday.  

Also sibo and sifo share many symptoms. 

Just my two cents, hope this helps."

MTHFR,fg1tg9z,t3_ewfck7,1580432947.0,"I’m a little rusty but iirc low comt enzymes will result in catecholamines
(dopamine, noradrenaline) being metabolized slower.  

In theory this would result in someone being able to focus more acutely on a topic for longer periods of time especially in calm environments but in stressful situations their catecholamines go too high and they get overwhelmed.   

The people with more comt enzymes have a lower catecholamine baseline which tend to cause them to seek excitement which then raises their dopamine/adrenaline allowing them to perform better under pressure.  

Also I believe riboflavin(b2) is a cofactor for comt, it seems to help me relax. 

Hope this helps!"
