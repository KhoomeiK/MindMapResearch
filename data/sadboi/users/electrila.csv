Finding motivation was the hardest part for me.  The medications I'm on of course have some effect on that now, but I did some major soul-searching and that's when I discovered this is what I truly love.  Anything you can find for motivation, try it.  Hell, sometimes I reward myself with a sweet treat for completing a project.  If you find what motivates you, latch onto that and run with it.  That may eventually lead to other forms of motivation that will keep you going in the long-term.

And, if you ever need someone to talk to or just want to chat, I'm always here.  I know I'm just a stranger on the internet, but I do care.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy trains you to recognize negative thought / action patterns that can either trigger or contribute to an episode and how to change your thinking. Most people with Bipolar Disorder benefit from combination med / CBT over med treatment alone.
