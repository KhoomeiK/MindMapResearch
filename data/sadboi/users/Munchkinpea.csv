Ours have what seem to be stupidly complicated relationships with each other.  Despite our best efforts to assert pack order, or in one case because of it, everyone seems to have a different idea of their place!

2 & 3 get along ok. They play together, but don't cuddle although I think 3 would like to. 

Unfortunately, despite taking a couple of months to slowly introduce and integrate 3, who is usually the most gentle and affectionate of the three, she will occasionally attack 1. Usually when 1 appears vulnerable, i.e. rolls over, or is picked up, etc.

Thankfully 1 is very independent, was never interested in playing with or cuddling, the others and is happy to have her own space. So she has access to other bits of the house, and during the day gets to choose whether she wants to be in 'her' space or 'communal' space."
