depression,fadrov3,t3_e8o14x,1575984311.0,"Pretty much every point you listed there. Except maybe the laughing part, most of the time I just feel apathetic and numb but sometimes I do laugh but it quickly fades away again"
depression,f8szrtp,t1_f8s4hv7,1574792685.0,"For me it isn't the hope that I have left or anything but rather the dilemma of dying and taking precious memories away from someone else while wanting to be dead myself. A few months ago my aunt told me that she ""saw"" or thought about my deceased grandmother (her mother) walking alongside me when she was walking behind me. My grandmother and I were very close and basically rasied me and it has stuck with me ever since that day and what I take away from my aunt if I ever were to kill myself. Even if I desperately want to die"

SuicideWatch,ewc120y,t1_ewa5wr6,1565275773.0,"Are we the same person? I've also done something in a similar vein to your cutting just recently. I have isolated myself from everyone for a week prior to going to a house party hoping someone would notice and care enough about me to check up on me but only 1 friend actually asked if everything was alright, but even that was 1 person more than expected. That even was the second time, the first time I isolated myself for like 3 days and nobody cared that much either. All this while I also don't like people who are attention seeking. I keep my depression pretty secretive but I just want to know if someone cares enough about me"
SuicideWatch,ewa1jzd,t3_cnfqb6,1565234878.0,"What you have typed out I also thought of countless times, literally the exact same, down to the neglect of the parents and the need for attention but also not wanting to seem like an attention whore.

And out of these days of Isolation only one person messaged me without me messaging first, so I guess nobodys gonna notice me being gone anyway"

SuicideWatch,eqz9jxc,t3_bzzzol,1560396175.0,This is exactly how I feel every time. Just today I tried to hang myself several times but always stopped when I was blacking out. I wanted to call a friend of mine because she somewhat knows of my depression but I couldn't do it because I don't want to bother her because she has her own problems and in my mind I'm not much of a friend to her

Only tried hanging myself like 10 times but always not pulling through and pulling my neck out of the noose.. I hate it"
depression,eqwfixo,t3_bzojzw,1560356512.0,I'm in the same boat. Most of the time I am the once asking if we wanna hang out and when I stop they'll never ask if I want to hang out. I have tested it out several times. Only like 3 people ever ask me if I want to come or something but them asking me is not that often
