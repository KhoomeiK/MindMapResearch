It's been strange watching the way the game has tried to shift it's balance between fighting over objectives and split pushing tactics over the last few years.

The dev's *want* people to team fight over objectives, yet if they place too much focus on that, then any character who isn't well suited to team fighting gets kicked in the teeth.

So alternatively, you make split pushing more powerful.  Now those same heroes that were losing because they couldn't team fight, leave the enemy team feeling like the team fighting was pointless, because it costs them games.

I think the push and pull of those two design choices has really left HoTS struggling.  They want all the heroes to feel viable and that leaves you with the need for some very specific metaknowledge to deal with it."

Now, Abi's XP was easiliy the highest in the team but \*NONE\* of that mattered, because we couldn't win a single objective.   The game pats Abi on the back for collecting the most XP, regardless of the lack of team fighting that lead to us losing.

No, owning multiple properties means having multiple, disposal, non-essential assets. That is not the same as having a mortgage that represents the root over your head.

Perhaps I wasn't clear.  Wealth is not ""living paycheck to paycheck"".  Earning enough to cover living expenses isn't ""wealth"".  Wealth is what you have *after* you've covered your day to day living expenses.  People who are forced to rent often don't have the ""wealth"" to afford to buy a home.

There's no reason for landlords to go bankrupt when they are in possession of assets.  They are welcome to sell those assets to cover their losses if they can't service their loans.  Tenants aren't in that position.  They don't even have an income."

What other choice is there if they've lost their jobs can can't pay rent?
Either landlords come to terms with their tenants or that's exactly what's going to happen.

>Yes. But not owning property comes at a risk too. It means you don't >have a place to call yours. Your borrowing others.

True, but there's something you've overlooked in your statement.  The idea that a person is renting **by choice**.  

A landlord didn't have to go out and buy a property for investment purposes.  It was a vehicle to make **more money**.  

They were in a position to increase their wealth.  

A tenant is most likely renting because they can't afford to buy a home.  Renting is dead money.  No one rents because it makes financial sense.  They do it because they've been locked out of the property market.

>Yea maybe. But you can't force people too. Not can you be sure that >bank routing the landowners would be a good move, as they are the >pillars that help hold up society...

But we can force people out of their homes because they can't afford to pay rent, because they've lost their jobs, through no fault of their own?
land owners aren't the pillars of society.  Banks are.  Banks will have the final say in how this all plays out, because they are the ones who really control the flow of money through the system."

Besides, you're talking about people's homes.  Do we really want to throw people out of their homes during this?  Not to mention the fact that properties will most likely stay vacant anyway.  Who's going to rent them?

Owning property comes with risks, just like all forms of investment.  Property owners have been on a pretty good run the last decade.

Having to swallow the loss during a once in a century event seems like one of those risks.

I tell them, I want you to remember a time when you were at your lowest.  The death of a pet, the loss of a job.  A grandparent dies.  Try to get it clear in your head.  Remember what it felt like.  How badly it hurt.  Got it?  Ok.

Now, imagine you wake up tomorrow, feeling just like that, except the event hasn't happened.  You have all the pain, but no explination.  You decide to ""be strong"" and suck it up.  It's one of the worse days of your life.

Now, you wake up the next day.  Same feeling.  Again.

Nothing you do can cheer you up.  Nothing seems to reach you, to bring relief.  It's only pain or numbness.  It goes on and on and on.  You watch as your friends and family all go on enjoying their lives, while you become more and more angry at how you can no longer share in the things that bring them joy.

baldursgate,fiyv355,t1_fiyp7ka,1582847621.0,"In some respects, I do wonder if they should have just called it ""Baulders Gate"" and done what movies seem to enjoy doing.

The original games had nothing to do with Baulders Gate.  It was just a setting, a region of the world to frame the story.  

Perhaps they could have been aforded a clean slate by distancing themselves from the previous games.

I suspect they thought that by alligning it with the previous titles, they'd have a ready made fanbase.

Clearly, this marketing strategy isn't off to a great start."
baldursgate,fiytucz,t1_fiyok7h,1582846814.0,"Right there with you man.  I watched the stream and all I could think was ""Wow, it's a little rough around the edges, but the bones are all there.  I can't wait to see where they take it!"". 

Then I come to reddit and it's endless streams of complaint.  I get it.  They wanted another infinity engine game in the Style of BG1 & 2.  But sometimes you just can't put the lightning back in the bottle.  You can't recapture the magic that made those games what they are.  Many have tried.

What you can do is make a brand new DnD game, based on the 5th edition rules, by people who are trying VERY hard to make a great experience.  It's alpha footage and I'm hopeful that going forward, people are going to judge the game on it's own merits.

I do know that the guys at Larin are trying their damn best to make a great game.  I hope the community at large can support them in that, even if it isn't the ""Baulders Gate"" they were expecting."

So yeah, some CRPGS will offer a very low T/F ratio for a 30 minute investment.  MMO's are absolutely garbage in this respect.  When you start thinking about time invested vs fun you've had you realise you spend a HEAP of time ""preparing to have fun""."

I hear you man.  I've seen so many wonderful people, torn away from the world while I sit here... enduring.  

For what exactly?  What makes my life worth living?  Why should these people who've contributed so much be robbed of rich full lives, while the rest of us get to just keep turning over, consuming resources and never really contributing back a fraction of what it costs to keep us here.

I just keep reminding myself.  Life is not fair.  It doesn't tally up good deeds.  There's no great force judging our actions and lives and dolling out rewards accordingly.  There's just life.  The end.  

Or as a cancer nurse once told me;

""Some people get long lives... others don't.  That's just how it is."""
depression,ffn9zne,t3_eu6iw5,1580063531.0,"I hear you man.  I'm not going to pretend I've got the answer, because both you and I know it's not that simple.

I don't think there is a point.  Not really.  Not a ""This is the one truth"" kind of point.  I think the only point of existing for a human being is the one we decide for ourselves.   That's it.

So if you decide there's no point?  There isn't.

If you decide the point is to rehome lost dogs?  There's your point.

All the things you do are meaningless?  Then life is meaningless.

I think life tends to reflect back on us through the lens we view it with.   That makes it horrifically difficult for people with depression.  How can you see any purpose or good in the world with that reflecting back at you."

This situation is \*exactly\* why you have break rooms.  Expecting your staff to eat lunch at their desks is begging for this kind of situation to happen.

Sure, in this case Amy seems a little nuts, but I've complained about co-workers playing loud music at their desks, talking constantly, eating strongly smelling food at their desks (fish! urrgh).  

It's an office, not a lunch room.  

I'd send it up the chain to get an offical ruling of company policy.  If they're happy for people to eat at there desks, then perhaps Amy can be relocated to another desk away from the irritation.

On the other hand, if they don't want you eating at your desk, then they can provide you with a proper break room."
