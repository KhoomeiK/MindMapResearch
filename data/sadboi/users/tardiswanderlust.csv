Ok.
'90% livestock is murdered in world..'? No. Places which regulate meat industry have animals stunned before slaughter. The idea of halaal has been adopted (without calling it the same) in most parts because it's considered healthier to let the excess blood flow out of the flesh. The process of slaughterhousing isn't as crude as we carry out. If nothing, we need the food industry regulations to be implemented better here. And how is chopping the head off any animal 'better' than slitting the throat? Chicken heads and bodies writhe around in pain even after being separated. It's only your belief that makes you think that the creature's head isn't in pain. Side note: human heads also act the same in guillotines. Also, many places in our country follow the process of breaking/severing the spinal cord and the animal dying of shock. Why's that never a concern?
