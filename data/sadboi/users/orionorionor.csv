Yeah. I know I ""feel"" different (read: more euphoric) when I'm in cooler places and using some THC (lowers body temp, *potent* antioxidant) on MDMA than I do in hot settings without any THC. I guess it would be pretty impossible to get a study intentionally causing brain damage in people approved, so this kind of thing might be hard to get good human data on.

Edit: heat exhaustion: I don't think acute heat exhaustion is proof of toxicity, even though they are connected by the serotoninergic temperature-regulating system. You could have heat exhaustion and no toxicity, but what makes the case is the article arguing that slight changes in ambient temperature raises core temp, *and* that in turn causes the MDMA to become significantly more neurotoxic. So maybe it's not an on/off switch of toxicity, but only that MDMA is *less* neurotoxic in cooler temps. I'm gonna keep taking my cool showers and smoking either way because it feels amazing."

And yeah, isolates are good for pharma (patentable! just look at Epidiolex, ugh) but not for people (overgeneralization, but broadly true). Generally speaking, isolates have more side effects. To loop back to opioids, raw opium contains \~45 different alkaloids that all balance each other out, so that constipation, respiratory depression, and other side effects are VASTLY reduced using opium than isolated compounds (morphine, codeine, etc) but the painkilling effect is still very prevalent. We see that with THC and full-spectrum cannabis, too; a little bit of CBD is good for preventing side effects like paranoia, overeating, overconsumption, etc. When we isolate the parts, the potential for side effects is greater."

I'm unsure to what extent, if at all, that has influenced my K experiences, but it seems to make a big difference for the MDMA. I have also come very close to hole-ing on the tail end of a roll, which was visually and haptically interesting but perhaps not necessary or especially beneficial. I'm not sure. Now I use it to delete the uncomfortable MDMA comedown, but I don't take large doses with my M.

On it's own, even a sub-threshold dose insufflated at the very beginning of my day seems to open my perspective, make me more accepting of my situation, and excited to make life changes that will benefit me, even if they'll be temporarily uncomfortable.

NonBinary,eowwuqc,t3_bte4bl,1558915985.0,"Hell yeah! You do you. I like this because I see less of people expressing themselves along their prescribed gender lines while still claiming genderqueer identities. Being in that boat myself some of the time, it's good to see. And I looove your makeup!"

MtF,eovezb2,t3_bt6vfp,1558894108.0,"Personally, I have had some great experiences and some weird experiences meeting partners online. You might have good luck the first time, you might not. As another poster said, as long as you and your partner are safe and consenting, exploration can be really worthwhile and fun. Personally, I'm always most comfortable and have had the best experiences with people I have gotten to know a little bit before we get physical. You might have different preferences, though, and that's okay.

I have not done HRT, can't speak to that. But I just wanted to say that it's totally fine if you find you don't like having sex, or prefer having sex with only yourself. Asexuality is totally valid, too. I hope you find what feels best to you!"

Saved for this line. Needed to read that reminder today. Thanks."
MtF,eovdjq2,t1_eov5y01,1558893201.0,"I think you hit the nail on the head here. Being genderfluid myself, and having been with cis/straight/queer/enby people, verbal communication is absolutely crucial for everyone to be getting their desires met or even feeling seen. I don't have any idea to what extent you and your partner have communicated around this, and I'm not making assumptions. In my case, while it took some getting used to and doesn't feel sexy at first, better communication led to better sex. Beating myself up has never helped me to communicate more clearly or have more enjoyable sex. Just a thought. I wish you and your partner the best!"
depression,eokk5ze,t1_eokj8fy,1558656531.0,I live with a fellow suicidal depressive who will not allow me to get a cat (he owns the house). I might show him this as a way to change his mind.

depression,eokj29z,t3_bs3kvv,1558655797.0,"Whoa, this is hella relatable. I manage two stores and I'm pretty sure I'm putting in my two weeks tomorrow because I just can't fucking fake it anymore. That's my balance between not letting my employers/parent figures down and not actually torturing myself. Maybe I can find a nice dark salt mine to work in, or take up piracy. I can't think past those two weeks.

&#x200B;

I don't feel better after laying in bed and crying, but I feel *way* worse after faking happy to customers and the new people I'm training all day. So I feel ya. 

&#x200B;

Hold out for that doctor visit. Maybe he has good drugs. 

&#x200B;

Well this ended up being all about me and I'm a piece of shit. Sorry. I hope you feel better."
depression,eokinds,t1_eogtbsk,1558655519.0,"Me too but sometimes I just forgot I took MDMA the morning of the day I felt really good. 

&#x200B;

For real though, drub aguse makes it really tough to pinpoint ""real"" symptoms. I am a total nut but undiagnosed for everything else because in the last 6 years of seeking help off and on I've never been clean from everything for long enough to be diagnosed (6 months). So...I'm just a crazy drug addict. But this is exactly my same pattern. When I am sober, I usually feel really good until I'm 4 months in and then I get super manic about some project and move across the country or something, always getting high as part of the Grand Plan."
cbdinfo,eokde4i,t3_aft3wa,1558652044.0,"1, 4, and 5 are specious claims at best. These are plants that contain substances that inhibit the breakdown of endocannabinoids in the human body, not plants that contain cannabinoids themselves. Some of these I don't know well enough to comment on, but the cacao/human breast milk misunderstanding really bothers me (I work in the CBD industry and get to hear this all the time - it just isn't true). 

&#x200B;

Liverwort is probably the most interesting of the bunch for recreational users of plant compounds - most of the others are non-psychoactive except in special circumstances. 

&#x200B;

Fun fact: BCP (beta-caryophyllene, in black pepper and hundreds of other things) has a higher binding affinity for CB2 receptors than CBD! It's also a full agonist."
leaves,eojr8i1,t1_eohfuuo,1558641757.0,Those are some big changes. Good for you! Can I ask what made you stop using CBD? I manage two CBD stores and all my coworkers smoke/use psychedelics. I think I have to change my career to stay off the grass/other stuff.
oilpen,eoiuqzq,t1_eofnf8i,1558627718.0,"This doesn't make sense to me. Oil is not water-soluble, period. ""Dabs"", are, uh, oil. Maybe the vapor going from hot to cold very quickly as it hits the water re-solidifies some of it, causing it to stick to your piece, but that's still not solubility."
leaves,eoh0rdf,t1_eogyspe,1558570141.0,Were you using concentrates? There have been times I could smell the oil in my sweat a surprisingly long time after quitting. But generally  I lose the sweats around day 3.

Drugs,eogbw1j,t1_eog9hos,1558554823.0,"Personally if I were going to go the bioassay route (but I wouldn't, I'd send it to a lab) I would start much lower than that. There are things that are active at tenths of a milligram, where 1mg would be a dangerous dose."

Gundam,eoduj7k,t1_eo6869k,1558481336.0,Seconded; 08th MS team is what got me back into Gundam after several years of not watching any anime. It's a great little series.
LearnJapanese,eo9o92e,t3_bqwyjq,1558396212.0,"Hello there, I have some relevant lived experience to throw in the mix. I studied both simultaneously for a year in high school while also studying Russian via a community ed class. That was a bit much, and I ended up dropping the Russian, but German and Japanese were not hard to study concurrently. in contrast to other posters, I will not talk up the similarities. We're talking a language isolate (best we can tell) and a Germanic language. Actually, the more similar languages are, the harder they are to learn together. Japanese and German were plenty different enough that I never got syntax or vocab mixed up, at least. I think in the end it totally comes down to your talent, interest level, and determination. Pretty much all I did that year was study languages, but it was pretty fun. I was also tutoring both German and Japanese in that year. When you get to the point that you're capable of it, I totally recommend tutoring whatever language you're learning. It's the absolute best way to cement that knowledge into your brain."
