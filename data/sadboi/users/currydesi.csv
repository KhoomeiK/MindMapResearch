It feels a little too late to come and accept myself but I also feel like I’m genuinely a good person and my heart’s in the right place. I shouldn’t allow hating men to dictate how to feel about my body because they don’t live in it. I do have a boyfriend who isn’t bothered at all by the size or shape but I’m still very insecure due to the decades of torment. But I have to say, especially to the men who commented on here, thank you so much. You’ve no idea how I felt reading through your messages and comments. I would’ve never thought some men would actually prefer smaller boobs. It makes me see myself differently now. I’ve saved a lot of the comments just so I can read them whenever I feel less than a woman/person. Thank you all♥️"

But I do believe there are people out there who don’t watch porn or don’t associate with things of that nature, and if it doesn’t work with them, I’d rather be on my own and “feel safe”. 10yrs of therapy and nothing has helped.

I know far too much about him to not feel affection or care about him, so in many ways it explains why I never want to love someone else the same way I did him. 

I’ve come to acknowledge we can have soulmates each time we meet different people. He was my best friend and my soulmate for a good period of time, and now that I’ve moved on I want a better relationship. A healthier one. A more understanding and secure relationship.
