ForeverAlone,f567v7l,t1_f527i3i,1572019747.0,"I wish I could help you out but I'm kinda in the same situation haha. Although I'd say there's no harm in asking someone to meet up, especially if you already know them. If the person really doesn't want to hang out with you, they'll probably come up with some reason to avoid it. And that'll suck. I know how it feels. But in a weird way, it'll be relieving.  I can go back to being alone knowing that I don't have to constantly think about what could have been. There are times when I've actually planned to meet up with someone and then I back out at the last minute coz I get kinda anxious and want to stay at home. And then the cycle repeats. Sigh."
ForeverAlone,f50ebap,t1_f4zj65c,1571926113.0,"I feel exactly the same as you do. I think I'll only ever be able to date someone who is just as FA as I/we are, but even if that person is FA, I doubt we'll even be dating if we had the chance coz we'd both suck at trying to get together."

But then again, there are always people that don't like a game no matter how good it is. From my experience, I honestly didn't think I'd like it but the idea of fighting robots with a bow and arrow was enough to get me to start playing. No regrets."

AskReddit,f406p48,t1_f4069dt,1571286901.0,"Yeah, initially I liked it for the comedy and dark humour, but as the season progressed, I started liking it for the characters and to see how they live their lives. Never thought I would be so emotionally invested in a cartoon."
AskReddit,f405vu3,t1_f402jnl,1571286104.0,You really should. I watched the first episode a couple of months back and didn't really like it. I've been down lately and picked it up again and I could relate to it in a way. Ended up finishing all 5 seasons in like a week haha. Then found out that season 6 is coming out October end. Can't wait!
depression,f3b3vg1,t3_dgdquu,1570800936.0,Agreed. I like late nights and early mornings just because everyone is in bed and everything's so peaceful. My work starts at 6 AM and every morning between 5-8 AM has slowly become my favourite part of the day.

AskReddit,f1dn7yi,t1_f1dl8tw,1569390592.0,"I guess the only thing that I know most well about myself are my negative thoughts and depression. Without it, I'm just emotionally numb.

Just thought I'd answer your question."

It's nice that you have stuff to look forward to personally but when you're depressed, just thinking about the future makes you tired. It's an endless cycle of self loathing. I hate it."

reddevils,f0rmhfe,t1_f0rgivm,1568887544.0,"Among other reasons, this is one reason why I prefer Android. When you're using your phone and you get a call, it just shows as a notification on top of the screen, and you can choose to ignore it and continue with what you're doing. If my memory serves me right, this feature was introduced 3 or 4 OS versions back. Pretty sure majority of the iPhone users aren't aware of it, so Apple also doesn't bother."

AskReddit,f0l06cm,t1_f0kybby,1568693393.0,"Ooh yeah, that'd be pretty sick. I'd prefer not to have Deadpool though. Don't get me wrong, I love Deadpool as a character and the movies as well, but I feel like having him in Spiderman would kinda make him the star, and people would not really appreciate the movie for the reasons why the first part did so well. Not sure if what I'm saying totally conveys my thoughts but yeah"

Haven't added anything for the camera, but it's fine exposed. No scratches or anything even though I sometimes slide my phone on the table when putting it down. I was using the official OP carbon bumper case before that, and it's amazing. Dropped my phone quite a few times and it protects it well. But I didn't like the bulk that it added to the phone, and I'm not a fan of putting cases on phones in general."
AskReddit,ezydj6t,t1_ezxy3ij,1568265973.0,"Totally.

I'm currently undergoing training and can't bring myself to concentrate and learn shit. Pretty sure I'm going to get noticed once I have to start doing actual work. Worst part is, I know I need to improve, but it's just so hard and I don't really care at the same time."
