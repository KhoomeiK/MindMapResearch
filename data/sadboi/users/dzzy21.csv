Miscarriage,fn55o2t,t3_fzgoz0,1586656523.0,"I'm so sorry that you're going through this again. Yes not your fault but I do agree, sometimes it does make you feel like that. I know I have. Been through 4 miscarriages, most recently a week ago. But you will get through this. And again it does make us feel like shit but it's okay, we're allowed to feel this way. And then we try again. Sending you hugs! Be safe."
Miscarriage,fmvu55m,t3_fxpt84,1586430986.0,"Hey mama. I'm sorry that this is happening to you again. I just had my 4th miscarriage a week ago. I remember my 2nd miscarriage. I went to different ob sonologists to get an ultrasound. First ultrasound, didn't find any heartbeat and growth.  The 2nd ultrasound, ob sono said she found a heartbeat. I guess she took a lot of time and effort, bless her. The 3rd ultrasound, no heartbeat and growth again. Finally I miscarried and had a d&c. 

I got tested for APAS after my 3rd miscarriage but got a negative result so that wasn't it.

I know the feeling. We're holding on to every hope we can get. Any little movement any little growth is super precious to us.

Sending you hugs. Stay safe."
Miscarriage,fmoloh8,t1_fmnshey,1586262795.0,"Thank you for sharing your experience. My goodness 7""x1""  that must have been so terrifying! I am still spotting a bit here and there, still passing some little brown clots and stringy bits. I'm afraid i might retain something and it's really that thing i wish i had closure on via ultrasound but sadly not an option right now. Did you take any iron or multivitamins then? I'm concerned about the blood loss although I didn't bleed so much this time, but just scared of one day just bleeding out and getting light-headed or faint. Thanks again and pls stay safe as well!"
Miscarriage,fmlcoza,t1_fml42tm,1586183743.0,Thank you. I might just try the pregnancy test since going to the hospital is not an option for me right now. :)

Coronavirus,fkend1a,t3_fi14db,1584116750.0,"Hello, just curious regarding recovery. Once a person recovers from the virus, does it give them lifelong immunity to it? Does the virus remain dormant in the body and when immunocompromised may come out again? Thank you for doing such good work!"

Coronavirus,fjnnuji,t3_fefj9n,1583511218.0,"1. I have read about people recovering from it and being discharged in the hospital only to test positive again in a few days and consequently dying, as is the case in China. Why do you think this happens? Does it mean the virus is just dormant and could just wake up again? 

2. Also read that children or babies recovered quicker, is there something different about their immune systems vs adults?

Thank you in advance!"

Fatal Frame series. Unique gameplay, super creepy Japanese horror ghost jump scares. I will never forget the times when I had to stop playing because I was too freaked out to play alone."

Anxiety,exu1q0c,t3_cudddh,1566578160.0,"I am on the same boat as you are now. Customer complaint and not just me but some others in our company. Co-worker told me it's not too bad but I just can't get over the fear that i might get demoted or worse, fired. :( It's a tough place to be in to be honest. I felt like throwing up when I found out about it. I don't feel like doing anything else to block it out since my mind keeps on going there. I don't know how to get over this. I feel like a major failure. I wish I could just rewire my brain to stop it from thinking about it. PMS makes my anxiety worse too."

Whenever a coworker starts a chat convo with a , ""Hey I got news,"" and sends it, and leaves me hanging for seconds while I see them typing on the chat box, I feel like throwing up from thinking of all possible things that could happen. Did I mess up? am i losing my job? Did i do something wrong? Am i fired? How am I going to pay my bills? The typing takes FOREVER like the longest 30 seconds of my life. In that span of time, I have thought of all worst possible scenarios. Ugh! I hate this."
