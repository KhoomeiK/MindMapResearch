streamelements,fm9vkmo,t3_frwef7,1585877553.0,You could set up a bot on labs to that also has a !shoot command and does the second function
streamelements,fm9v7uc,t3_ftdxqe,1585877324.0,I use an AverMedia card but it's probably a similar set up. I use a three pole aux lead to plug my controller into my capture card and then plug my headset into the card. This allows me to both hear the game audio and record it and allows party chat to record (if mates have sharing it enabled)
playmygame,fm44pkd,t1_flvdmyd,1585746446.0,So we had a problem trying to play this. Remote play kept just letting my mate just take over my screen and become player one meaning I couldn't pick a character and we ended up BOTH controlling the same blob lol

I can't even begin to imagine how I would've coped if anyone had watched my ordeal online. In fact I can say with certainty that I wouldn't be here now.
You are an incredible woman. I admire you greatly."
AverMedia,flpy60u,t1_flouuwd,1585372351.0,"It will work as long as you have installed RecCentral too.
I use OBS Live with Streamlelements to capture."
AverMedia,flmjxl8,t3_fpn09j,1585285878.0,"Hey. The AverMedia Assist software is like the central hub for your cars. It is where updates will go for both the card and the software etc. Once you install that you can get RecCentral from there.
Although you need it installed for you card to work I do not recommend using Rec as it's still rather rudimentary.
I would go with OBS live or Streamlabs."

I'll keep my fingers crossed this all passes soon and your day ends up even better than it would have before.
We got engaged on valentine's and were about to book our venue for next April but it closed indefinitely and I know all the slots will go to people who postponed, which is absolutely right, but it makes me sad knowing it could be even longer than a year before I can be his Mrs"

AverMedia,fi2q5x8,t1_fi2q0xy,1582085957.0,"It could be but not sure.
Are you using base obs or streamlabs"
AverMedia,fi2pr8x,t3_f63lh5,1582085640.0,Yes. It carries the mic sound. Without a three line the mic can't travel to the box.
ptsd,fi2pkft,t3_ez7jrm,1582085498.0,Yes but anime. It's so magical and beautiful if makes me feel like a kid again for the 20mims an episode lasts. Safe.. happy..carefree.

I used to struggle with the whole *if I sleep now then I'll never sleep tonight"" dilemma but then I figured it doesn't bloody matter because I need the nap because I didn't bloody sleep. If I'm gonna struggle anyway I may as well get a few winks in whilst I can."

I don't sleep much if at all due to pain from pancreatitis.

When people say this to me it takes every single ounce of strength for me not to kill them on the spot. 
Don't they know a lack of sleep leads to extreme crankiness just below the surface?!"
AverMedia,fi2od4b,t3_f63lh5,1582084592.0,"Is the cable going into the controller a three line or a two line?
If it's two that's why you got no mic sound."
