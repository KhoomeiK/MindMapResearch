If he says no and doesn't suggest other plans then just ask ""are you interested in seeing each other again?"" because if not, it'll save you both a lot of time and emotions. Reading between the lines rarely turns out well so I opt to just ask directly. If he gives you a vague answer and you need to know more, then just let him know where you stand and ask if he's on the same page. If not, move on and count your losses.
