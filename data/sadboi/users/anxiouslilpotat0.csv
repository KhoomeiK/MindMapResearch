socialanxiety,ewuzbuj,t1_ewuz7yu,1565795165.0,I think it doesn't matter. It's a mental illness so depends how bad your own is
socialanxiety,ewuza97,t1_ewuyrbc,1565795135.0,"More men commit suicide-more mental illness is reported in women. 

That's cause of men being expected to not show emotion, that's slowly changing. 

And like I said!! My overall point is that you just can't as a fact say one side has it easier. 

I'm not talking about in general. I'm talking about having social anxiety disorder and everyone's saying women have it easier but?? It's a mental disorder it doesn't matter what gender you are it matters how severe your disorder is."

socialanxiety,ewux0xs,t1_ewuwriq,1565793664.0,"Being a woman is easier? Fuck off right now. 

You don't have to go through half the things we do! Imagine having panic attacks from being around people and then having strangers shove shit up your privates. Yes I'm talking birth and smear tests. 

My point was: yes men and women have different expectations but we both have them. And it literally depends on the person and their social anxiety as to how hard it is.

Also think about the other side of approaching. What about women not being approached or being able to approach because of social construct"
socialanxiety,ewuwhln,t1_ewuw7ci,1565793311.0,The woman has her part in relationships too and she could be as equally scared to do those things

socialanxiety,ewuw8wv,t1_ewuvwkd,1565793149.0,"Personally I don't find it easy to be approached. I freak out. 

And there's more to SA than just couples. 
And even if being shy as a women isn't as negatively perceived which it is. You feel scrutinised regardless!! That's the whole point of SA. It doesn't matter what gender stereotype u have. Social anxiety will make u suffer. 

Also, if one thing is harder for men to do for example approaching, there will be something the woman has to do which she will find equally as terrifying. There are different occurances but with equal pain"
socialanxiety,ewuuxui,t3_cq7yle,1565792278.0,Girls w SA have it just as hard as guys with SA. Yeah there are expectations for guys to be tough and confident but there's also expectations for girls too.
