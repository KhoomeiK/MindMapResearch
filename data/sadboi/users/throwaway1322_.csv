SuicideWatch,eqpwcx2,t3_bytg4w,1560205798.0,"I felt so suicidal the past week, attempted (clearly failed) and planned to attempt again today. Today was the only time Iâ€™d get a while alone to myself in the house. When the time came I felt so elated and like I kept coming up with other things to do. Just this one thing, then this, to fill the last few hours and make them as happy as I could. Now my momâ€™s back and I canâ€™t do it. I delayed too long feeling okay and as soon as the window of opportunity closed Iâ€™m right back to needing to do it."
depression,eqepze5,t3_by8x45,1560007742.0,What you need to do is definitely try to take your meds again. They probably wonâ€™t make you feel worse than you do now and they could even help.
MadeOfStyrofoam,eqepjwf,t1_eqe7jb7,1560007553.0,Beat me to it. How did it get to mean this?
SuicideWatch,eqdng5h,t3_by4pbw,1559992276.0,"Itâ€™s so difficult to have a support system ripped from you. Your parents sound like your best bet right now, along with professional help. Your ex, friends and roommate seem to have shown you how they truly feel; they now no longer deserve a place in your life. Iâ€™m going through a similar thing and I know itâ€™s so so so difficult. But we have to hope for some kind of better people and treatment. You donâ€™t deserve to feel like this"
SuicideWatch,eqdmqf5,t3_by342x,1559991934.0,"Recently, every day. Itâ€™s constantly in the back of my mind and itâ€™s mostly also in the forefront"
depression,eqdjs7c,t1_eqd2wdi,1559990454.0,"I felt happy with certain people and groups. Now theyâ€™re all sick of me and donâ€™t want to be around me. I know theyâ€™ll hurt when I die, but they wonâ€™t show me that right now and itâ€™s just an all round shitty situation"
depression,eqdheqv,t3_by4jn7,1559989341.0,This is terribly sad. It really hit me
SuicideWatch,eqbcxx7,t1_eqb6mpk,1559947869.0,Sure but itâ€™ll take a while haha
SuicideWatch,eqbcgr8,t3_bxzdrf,1559947710.0,This is so well written and seems very considered
SuicideWatch,eqbb0ao,t3_bxzjrk,1559947208.0,This comes along and punches you in the gut. I feel for you so much. The aftermath is devastating. I hope you can find peace
SuicideWatch,eqb4lw0,t3_bxyzxk,1559944829.0,I like the idea of this in theory but I donâ€™t think I could stand uninterrupted time with myself like that
depression,eqazywi,t1_eqaucub,1559942866.0,"This hit the nail on the head, holy shit. This is so so well put"
SuicideWatch,eqavx4n,t3_bxz7at,1559940870.0,"I feel this too. When I reach out for help I bring everyone down with me. They have their own lives which donâ€™t revolve around my pain and complaining so they want to get back to them. Their patience will wear out, theyâ€™ll get sick of hearing the same shit and they get pissed off. Then I canâ€™t reach out again for a while, and when I get to itâ€™s a floodgate"
SuicideWatch,eqa6nnd,t1_eqa6cb3,1559926385.0,Could you tell me what it is?
SuicideWatch,eqa5pu0,t3_bxvn3b,1559925767.0,"Thereâ€™s a site called [lost all hope](lostallhope.com) which has a bunch of information on it about suicide, but doesnâ€™t necessarily promote or encourage suicide. The guy who made it actually survived an attempt and wanted to create a resource for people in similar places."
SuicideWatch,eqa57pc,t3_bxvwi7,1559925428.0,"Have you considered what will happen if your body doesnâ€™t give in? By that I mean, if you were to cut enough to *almost* bleed out, youâ€™re gonna be left with scars for the rest of your life. If you jump but donâ€™t die on impact, youâ€™re gonna wake up paralyzed"
SuicideWatch,eqa4llc,t3_bxw9gd,1559925019.0,"I am so, so sorry this is happening to you and your family. If heâ€™s working in the field, is there any connections he may have that could give you some kind of sliding scale payment therapy??"
SuicideWatch,eqa42mo,t3_bxuk99,1559924667.0,"I feel this too. I feel the weight he took away when he was near, and itâ€™s getting heavier and heavier. He was my first partner that before I went into the relationship, I had already taken time to work on my self and be in a better place to share my life with someone. But even then, even with all that work before and throughout the relationship, I was too much. My illness was too much and I didnâ€™t realise I was getting bad again till he was already gone. What was the point of two years of work? Iâ€™ve never felt this badly in my life."
SuicideWatch,eqa3kni,t3_bxvvio,1559924333.0,"Sometimes the pain isnâ€™t from some traumatic or specific event. It often doesnâ€™t matter whether youâ€™ve a wealthy or supportive family, whether you succeed in college or pursue a career you really have passion for; depression can hit anyone. Try to speak to the people around you. They will surely try to listen and help you"
SuicideWatch,eqa2xn4,t1_eq9xrmc,1559923901.0,This is very practical and solid advice. I hope youâ€™re able to take even one of these steps to start and it works for you OP!!
SuicideWatch,eq9p4o6,t3_bxuft0,1559914181.0,I feel the same. I donâ€™t have the answer for you. Iâ€™m trying to hold on till I get hope again. Hoping for hope if that makes sense

depression,eq9d0pg,t3_bxhmbo,1559900613.0,"This sums it up. The cycle of hope, abuse and loneliness is cruel but it wonâ€™t stop. I canâ€™t break it. Iâ€™m 22. Itâ€™s always been like this. I canâ€™t do another 60 years of this"
MadeOfStyrofoam,eq8gxvv,t3_bxj66g,1559865163.0,Nooo
depression,eq8edbe,t3_brsy1y,1559863805.0,Exactly this. Itâ€™s like the hope only builds to fall
SuicideWatch,eq8e94h,t1_eq8dsx0,1559863749.0,I donâ€™t know what to say or what anyone could say to help. I guess Iâ€™m hoping for that by posting though
