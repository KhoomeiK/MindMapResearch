relationship_advice,flczp45,t1_flczjru,1585052461.0,He naturally isnt affectionate and us stressed and depressed as he basically had a 1 in 3 chance of dying from corona due to other health issues. We've been together about 8 months and he was working on being affectionate to me but has recently stopped. Im also stressed and depressed because im terrified he may die and I've known him over half my life and couldnt handle losing him but it doesnt seem like he loves me anymore.

relationships,fj4k3be,t3_fbfff6,1583010111.0,"Shes got a time limit at her moms. Plus you purchased her a car and you've been dating less then two years and live separately. Plus shes demanding you live with her?

Whelp that's enough red flags for me folks.

Shes most likely using you, please, for your own happiness, drop her like a bad habit.

That is NOT a health relationship. It should be a partnership, not a one way street. You aren't a meal ticket.

Bonus is that shes demanding you guys start a family after dating for almost 2 years and not living together, you're definitely a meal ticket bud. That would gurantee her child support for once you figure out that shes using you and try to leave."
relationships,fj4j48v,t3_fbclnn,1583009461.0,"If he can make time for friends then he can make time for you. I get that he has alot of commitment but my sister has 2 kids and is a single parent and I still see her one on one more often then once a month. It sounds like the ""his kid cries when hes not there"" is an excuse to not have to spend time with you in a social setting (my guess is because there is no opportunity for sex). If he respected you then he would be able to take you out once a month and get coffee or go for a walk together (even if hes cash strapped). It seems he has little respect for you and how you feel about him.

Ask yourself these questions in any relationship:

1. Does he respect you? Does he let you make your own decisions and support them.
2. Does he listen to me and care about things I care about?
3. If something went wrong would I call him for help immediately?
4. When was the last time we did something together that doesnt involve sex?
5. Am I a priority to this person?
6. Do they show me they care? Are they willing to compromise do things to make me happy? Do I do the same?

As an example, my partner works 70 to 90 hours a week, on his one day off a month he takes me out on a date because he likes to go out and do something fun with me. He also is very respectful of my time, my body and my preferences. He works too much but he is building his career and I understand he has to put the work in now so he can move up. I can also count on him to help, support and take care of me in times of need."
