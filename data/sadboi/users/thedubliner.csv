I think you're not supposed to take melatonin long-term, but it might help you get started."

There are a lot of people here who have a disorder that sounds like it could be similar to yours. Many of them also seem to have anxiety about ALS and might be able to help you."

AskDocs,exced17,t1_exbipch,1566148763.0,"What caused the adhesions? Often they are caused by endo. A lot of GYNs are not qualified to look for endo and may miss it during a laparoscopy if it is not extensive (not their fault, it seems like the information is just not widespread enough). I would still recommend joining Nancy's Nook and seeing if they have any advice for you. Sometimes it takes a specialist to diagnose it properly.

What are your periods like?"
AskDocs,exbj8s9,t3_crypru,1566132393.0,"I would get a second opinion. That’s not normal. If your periods are particularly painful and the ultrasound didn’t show anything, you may want to check out /r/Endo and see if you think you may have endometriosis."
AskDocs,exbhy9z,t3_cs0e78,1566131612.0,"That could be it. Please check out Nancy’s Nook on Facebook if you haven’t already. They have more up-to-date information on endometriosis than you are likely to find a lot of other places, and they have a surgeon list if you need another surgery (though take it with a grain of salt and go for someone who’s been on the list a long time). /r/Endo is also a good resource."
AskDocs,exaae7r,t3_crvzye,1566103245.0,Check out /r/PMDD . Sorry you’re dealing with this :\

AskDocs,ewqg26g,t3_cpmz2o,1565664989.0,"Your post history really sounds like health anxiety. PLEASE consider seeing a mental health professional. Going days without eating will cause you to feel really bad. I am not a doctor, so hopefully one will respond, but in my layperson opinion I really think you need to investigate the health anxiety option."
SuicideWatch,evssiq4,t1_evreqhr,1564755198.0,"The brain isn’t necessarily required to experience something spiritual, though. The idea of an afterlife doesn’t require a body, though I’m would guess things would be different somehow without one."
SuicideWatch,evq78xh,t1_ev8en9q,1564687793.0,"The best thing to do would be to alert an adult you trust who knows him and then distance yourself. That way someone can look out for him and get him help if he needs it without that burden being on you, and you can get out of the situation."
