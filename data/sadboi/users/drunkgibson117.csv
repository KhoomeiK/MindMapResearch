This goes along with state and federal money the hospital will receive for exposure, which if our 50yr M pt. Is also on a ventilator it's a lot more funding for his visit and death. 
That's how health billing during any type of disaster works. 

Thus, it's not fraud although it is intentionally misleading for the sake of taking advantage of the situation. 

This has been pretty well documented but people have chosen to believe its flat ""covid deaths"" which medically and statistically is dishonest."

Follow me on this as it maybe a little hard to understand. 

As you sink your hips down try and pull your shoulders down and back (changing your posture and loading your lats) 

As you're doing this try to ""leg curl"" yourself into position, thus loading your hamstrings and hips. 

Always pull from a position of tension. This is the most missed aspect of a pull from beginner to late advanced.
