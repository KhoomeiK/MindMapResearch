reactivedogs,flspvld,t3_fqjw24,1585447845.0,"When a dog approaches, place your self between the two dogs (your dog behind you). Take a step towards the off leash dog with a hand extended and yell “NO!”

If the dog continues to approach and gets closer, swing a leg towards it in a kicking motion. If the dog still gets close enough, kick it. (I know this sucks but it’s better than a dog fight, it doesn’t have to be a hard kick). 

If you see an owner, immediately scream at them “MY DOG BITES!” Doesn’t matter if she wouldn’t bite, this will get the quickest response. I still use it with my friendly and non reactive dog, because I hate off leash dogs.

Other options include carrying pet corrector, an airhorn, and/or carrying a stick to poke the dog away (and pry jaws open if it came to that). 

Perhaps you could practice these exercises with your dog and a known dog, so it is controlled and your dog can get used to being placed behind you and remaining calm for the kicking and screaming."

As of two days ago, we are now only doing appointments two days a week and no volunteers are allowed in the building. We got as many of our animals as possible into foster homes or rescues, because we had to lower number of staff in the building and were already close to capacity. Our in-shelter population is lower than I’ve ever seen now, but we are still getting 5-10 new animals a day. We take in lost/strays/surrenders/animal control seized. We are doing our best to prevent surrenders by giving people free food if that is their issue with keeping the pet. It’s stressful to not know what will happen. My first thought when shut downs began was about euthanizing animals if we closed for adoptions. So far the number of requests we’ve had for new fosters and adopters has been overwhelming, we can’t keep up with it. Donations are coming in as well. We have also been specifically requesting food donations or money to stock our food pantry to prepare for preventing future surrenders due to inability to buy pet food. I still fear we will run out of places to put the animals, or become unable to complete the adoption process due to stricter controls about who can come and go from their homes. We are not “no kill” but have not euthanized for space in many years."

Like I get that there’s a risk I guess but it just feels like they’re saying they don’t want to deal with any issue that’s “too difficult.” And it is a common issue. Ive struggled with finding a therapist who will work with chronic suicidal ideation
TalkTherapy,fghnsso,t1_fgguvk2,1580789126.0,"I mean I would love to be able to report him to be honest lol. After the way he terminated me. Maybe that’s just the anger speaking though. I’ve had almost a year to process it all at this point and I’ve gone back and forth between desperately wanting his approval and wanting to kill him. I’ve settled into what I think is a somewhat rational level of anger about the situation. I mostly don’t care anymore but it still pisses me off. I just never thought I actually had a valid claim in reporting any of it. And still, maybe nothing would come of it, I just hate the way he treated me in the end. I had been thirsty for revenge for a long time but I’ve really mostly moved past that.

Basically... I disclosed planning a suicide attempt, and being evaluated and then released by a psych in the ER. Signed a safety contract with him and planned a session for the next day. The next day he starts session by telling me he is going to call the police. Calls the police. I flee. I’m handcuffed and involuntarily escorted to the hospital and institutionalized. When I get out I contact him to see if my scheduled standing appointment is on as planned. He says no, and refuses to meet with me unless I re-enroll in an expensive out of pocket therapy program. Does not provide any other referrals. I find out from my parents that he met with them and talked about me while I was in the hospital, basically said he wanted to call the police on me because he thought my parents were “coddling” and “enabling” me when they had come in the past to pick me up and take me to ER to be assessed..."
TalkTherapy,fggseou,t1_fgfilmg,1580768511.0,I was definitely not stalking. I googled his name and clicked through the first few results.
TalkTherapy,fggsa1b,t1_fgftnkv,1580768430.0,"He did not technically disclose that my mother had said something, but clearly I knew who the information came from because I never talked to anyone else about it. I literally just mentioned it to her in passing and didn’t think about that conversation again until he brought it up. There is definitely HIPAA in my country cause I live in the US lol. I believe I did sign something saying the therapists could discuss me with other therapists in the practice because I sometimes worked with other therapists other than the one I saw individually (attended groups). I am not sure if that meant they were allowed to disclose identities during those discussions. Also this was not the only time that something I said to someone made it through this chain. I once said something to my therapist, who told my mother’s therapist, who told my mom. It was a smaller inconsequential thing that I had already told my mom, but knowing that information was traveling like that felt super fucked. Also I wasn’t dropped as a client for this particular issue but I did get dropped later on. My mom never seemed bothered by these exchanges even though I tried to tell her that it was uncomfortable and unethical."
TalkTherapy,fgfe5oe,t1_fgfb6hc,1580736031.0,"It was so embarrassing I wanted to die lol. In my opinion the way he found out was pretty shitty. I talked to my mom about being worried about something I saw on there (him talking about having a child) because I’d had previous therapists who got pregnant and left for a while and it sucked. My mom told her therapist who was at the same practice, who told my therapist, who then brought it up with me. So, I was pretty pissed at my mom‘s therapist... and a bit at my mom but it’s not really her fault."
TalkTherapy,fgf9vmf,t3_ey0bdj,1580731648.0,My therapist found out I’d seen his social media and confronted me about it in session...
AmItheAsshole,ffcqdhf,t1_ffcq1t1,1579805030.0,"I personally wouldn’t call him an adult, but I guess he technically, legally is an adult"
AmItheAsshole,ffcqafy,t1_ffcq19u,1579804972.0,"Yeah that’s basically what I was going to say to him, I’d just rather not even have that contact if I don’t have to. I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t being a major asshole by not informing him"
AmItheAsshole,ffcq726,t1_ffcpyyd,1579804911.0,"Oh this is smart. That’s only happened a few times, usually they just take it back and I never see it again. But I’ll start doing this."
AmItheAsshole,ffcq3q6,t1_ffcpvxm,1579804851.0,"I was wondering if I could legally throw them away, and how long I would have to wait to do that. After five years I throw away the non important looking things for the house’s previous owner/occupants, but still put return to sender on anything that looks somewhat important."

sleep,ffcp818,t1_ffced57,1579804272.0,Depression can definitely affect your sleep quality and make you sleep way more. Personally when I’m badly depressed I am fatigued no matter how much I sleep and I never sleep less than 10-12 hours. At my worst I was sleeping 16 hours a day (12 at night and a nap) and I was still exhausted every second I was awake. So maybe it’s not sleep quality but the depression that is messing with you.
careerguidance,ffcp031,t1_ffcdt58,1579804134.0,Thanks! This is a great idea
careerguidance,ffcoypk,t1_ffcdsje,1579804111.0,"Thank you! This is really helpful. I’ve actually suggested a few small changes for things already that have been implemented and are going well. Nothing huge, just some small things to help out with things that were being overlooked accidentally. 

One of my slowest coworkers was written up for being slow and asked me to observe him working to see what he was doing wrong. Everything looked fine when he knew I was watching, but when I’ve sneakily watched him working on other days... I catch him dallying or getting distracted for long periods of time. I think he needs better supervision which is not something I can provide. I like the guy, so I talked to my manager last week about him getting more training or more frequent observation, I just hope they follow through on it instead of writing him up again. I know my manager checked in with him several times yesterday."
careerguidance,ffccplv,t1_ffcb6kg,1579796617.0,"The nice manager is definitely appreciative and shows it, and my coworkers show it too. The other manager doesn’t care, he doesn’t know how to give a compliment and will actually continue to nitpick and criticize the extra work I’ve done on top of my regular duties. I’ve started to smile and nod while ignoring his criticism, he does the same thing to everyone lol. You can do perfect work and he’ll find something not in the job description for you to work on because he can never just say “great work today!” there’s always something wrong. I’m glad he’s not my direct supervisor, but he is in charge of the department."
careerguidance,ffcc5rk,t1_ffc8aae,1579796271.0,"Oh it definitely doesn’t show in front of my managers but I sometimes talk to/vent with my coworkers about it who are having the same issue as me. I always accept and do the extra work. They’re not all slow, many are very good. Also I’m aware that I’m the new kid at 4 months, but two of the people I’m having issues with were hired the week after me and one the week before me. A few of the others were there before me but they’ve only been there between 6 months-1 year, so they are far from being the most senior employees. The job duties are the same for all of us, I’ve done the work they’re being assigned to, so I know what they’re supposed to be doing."
careerguidance,ffca9sv,t1_ffc7c0s,1579795087.0,"I have gone to my managers about it a few times. Once for a coworker who has been there longer than me who I dislike, I was pretty harsh about it, he was given a warning. Once for a coworker hired at the same time as me who has been slow to pick things up, I told my manager he needs more training. I don’t think he’s done anything about it yet other than tell him he needs to be faster. 

The manager who is directly above me has openly talked to me about how slow some people are so he obviously knows, I’m just not sure he knows what to do about it. He is a little too nice sometimes. He’s also not much older than me and the rest of the employees. The manager above him is not very nice so I kind of avoid going to him unless I want the person to get in trouble. I’m supposed to get another review sometime soon so I’ll be sure to bring it up again."
sleep,ffc5e6i,t3_ess0v8,1579791925.0,It is probably because the quality of your sleep is lower than it should be. Do you wake up a lot? Feel like you aren’t sleeping deeply? Do you dream?
careerguidance,ffc51v3,t1_ffbzjzl,1579791698.0,"Nonprofit. There are employees in my department with higher positions who get better pay, and they used to have my job title. One of them was promoted right before I was hired. In the past people have also been “promoted” from my department to higher paying positions in other departments. The experience I get from this job will contribute to me having a career in this field which sorta makes it worth it, but doing the extra work won’t pay off in any direct way other than my boss liking me I guess. I’m staying for at least a year, then I may quit or go part time while finishing the last year of my degree. I would like to stay employed here or be rehired after finishing my degree but I’ll have to see what happens."
careerguidance,ffbvoth,t1_ffavdko,1579784328.0,"I will definitely continue doing it because I care about the work getting done correctly, some other people do not. I just find it frustrating because I am not sure if it will pay off. I don’t see any positions for me to be promoted into unless someone above me leaves. And everyone with my job title receives the same pay, even people who have been there over a year. I am not sure if that is because they don’t do yearly raises or if it’s because the pay for this position was raised by $1/hr for everyone a few months before I started, so the older employees did get some kind of a raise."
careerguidance,ffbvgb7,t1_ffbew1c,1579784106.0,"I guess so lol. If only there was a position for me to be promoted into, I am pretty sure there isn’t unless someone above me leaves. They had me training new people my fourth week so they must trust me."
shittyaquariums,ffavhmm,t3_esapvc,1579745443.0,"I work at an animal shelter and we get *so* many sliders surrendered to us. I don’t know why people keep getting them or where they come from. So this really pisses me off. The tanks we keep them in as temporary housing at the shelter are bigger than this and I always feel so bad when we have to keep them in there. We have limited space as we don’t usually house reptiles, and when we get 7 turtles brought in space gets tight. We at least use heat lamps and water conditioner..."
AnimalShelterStories,fer3zvf,t1_feqqcsh,1579349526.0,"Ah that sucks. Well you all are doing good work even if the public won’t acknowledge it. I know that doesn’t make it any easier. We have a rather large trapping program luckily. I would hate if we had to euthanize the huge number of ferals brought to us. Hopefully there will be a program there some day. I’m still amazed at the number of cats that come in for it every week, it’s non-stop. I’m wondering if we’ll ever get ahead of it and decrease the numbers. I know there’s a lot of them there but the scale of it just amazes me. I think we alter and release like 2,500 cats a year."
AnimalShelterStories,feqkaks,t1_feplibz,1579342852.0,Wow that is terrible :/ I’m so sorry. Do they not have the resources to perform euthanasia or do they just refuse to do it themselves?
