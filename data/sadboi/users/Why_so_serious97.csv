I thought right before going that I would have to live a life in only hatred. With everyone and everything hating me out there. I decided that I did not want it. I wanted something else. Life is not hatred. Is love. Is happiness. Not everyone is as bad as they (my parents) said they were. They said that everyone is selfish, egotistical, evil, manipulating, parasite.
