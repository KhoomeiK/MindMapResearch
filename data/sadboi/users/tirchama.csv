infp,f27ucde,t1_f27a9pn,1570046261.0,"Funnily enough, I've been disconnecting from myself, which resulted into this gap between me and others. At some point I kept revelling in this thought that no one knows me and will ever know me, which I still think is true up to an extent for you do not even truly know yourself (e.g. have you ever seen yourself trying to survive an ice age? I don't think so).

That doesn't take away, however, that there will be moments in which you will feel like parts of you are understood and you are drifting closer to other humans. Sometimes it takes some opening up from your side, or trying to understand the other person. 

Hopefully you will feel better soon, sending you all the good vibes!"
GetStudying,ezj76l4,t1_ezj6ew5,1567939751.0,"Honestly, I'm half way through my second year and I still don't have a clear cut system. Simply because courses change, each professor values different types of knowledge, my schedule keeps shifting, and so on. 

I would say: just give yourself some room and time. We all make mistakes, but that's part of the learning experience (: Good luck with it!"
GetStudying,ezj2plv,t1_ezhug29,1567937597.0,"These are solid tips, but I'd like to add three more things:

* For a really lengthy/difficult reading, it can help to skim to find the general line first and/or read the reading questions if available. That prepares you for the nitty gritty details.
* Explaining it to someone afterwards cements the information better. Someone who's not knowledgeable will truly test your memory, whereas someone from your major can help fill in the gaps you didn't get/remember.
* Exercise daily. It really makes me feel more awake and productive. Go get those endorphins!"
GetStudying,ezj26yi,t3_d18nru,1567937349.0,"The real question is: what version works for *you*?

Honestly, the only way to find out is by experimenting yourself. Ideally, of course you would do it as often as possible, but obviously there are some factors that need to be taken into account:

* Time available.
* Concentration and mental energy available.
* How important that particular course is.
* What topic need more attention."
femalefashionadvice,ezj1qm9,t1_ezixgjk,1567937117.0,"The first thing that came to my mind was mood boards which is basically shopping but without spending any money. Usually once I have a clearer view on what I exactly want, I have a much easier time wading through the seas of clothing on the market. 

Moreover, I've been waiting a good few days, sometimes week before I pull the gun. If I keep daydreaming about all the outfits I could put together with that one item, it's always a good sign. I hope this helps a bit! There's probably much more I could say on this topic though."
infp,ezj0y5q,t1_ezh5uw2,1567936734.0,"This, really helped me a lot when I was/am spiralling. It's good to get very specific about why you don't feel good enough, because it usually makes me at least realise that it's mainly based on an ingrained, irrational belief.

Also, some food for thought: will you ever arrive, if you keep wanting to improve yourself? Like, we all tell ourselves once x happens, you will feel okay. But by the time that occurs, you will definitely have found another aspiration. That's how the human mind work; constantly striving for self-actualisation which is not bad, if not taken to the extremes that is. 

Sometimes I just have to repeat to myself that where I am is good enough, because inherently everything and everyone is 'flawed' and 'imperfect' yet also whole. We're all work in progress, yet also an art piece (:"

However, now I'm back at my international university, I mainly think in English again. Nevertheless, I can never remember what language I dream in, unless that person is strongly associated with one language."

infp,eos70hi,t1_eory26q,1558818628.0,"I pretty much agree with this comment, but I'd like to add that doing something that scares you desensitises you to your anxiety/fear as well. That doesn't mean, however, that this always holds up as improvement is not linear so please don't beat yourself up if the first three times go extremely well but you seem to be regressing the fourth time. It's okay, you are trying your best."

infp,eos5ghh,t1_eorjmvq,1558817926.0,"I haven't figured out much, but so far I noticed enjoying be semi busy whilst interacting with a diverse array of knowledge. I have been living on my own for a while, and I like it generally speaking. But it does get a bit lonely at times, which is why I usually try to spend quality time at least once a week with someone. 

The most soul sucking period was probably when I was transitioning from primary to high school? I was so lost, didn't know at all what I wanted out of life, and myself. Ever since then, I have been getting increasingly busier, but they're all things I genuinely enjoy so it makes me feel good generally speaking."
GetStudying,eos3udh,t3_bswgaa,1558817240.0,"Hmmmm, have you looked into your old exams? Because those would tell you more about your weak points.

Also, interleaved practice helps, if you aren't already doing that. As in mix up different subjects. It might be more laborious in the beginning, but it does promote transfer of learning, and mirrors the format of most exams better."
