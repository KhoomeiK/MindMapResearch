LoveIsBlindOnNetflix,fi6mdcs,t3_f6rtyi,1582200971.0,"HONESTLY. Ugh she's so annoying! Also, all the arguments she keeps trying to instigate with Mark, like what in the world?? She's clearly trying to force something with him and is so fucking insecure about anything he does right?? She needs to sort herself out before she tries to be in a relationship! She has soo many issues and just keeps self sabotaging herself ðŸ™„"
adhd_anxiety,fdanzyf,t1_fdam8gy,1578248234.0,"I always start a lot sooner, but somewhere along the way lose all focus and motivation. The assignment starts feeling boring and then it's harder to get back on track. But the last minute panic keeps me in check a little cause I know I can't really put it off any longer and have to somehow just get it done"
adhd_anxiety,fda77ut,t3_ekf6h1,1578242563.0,"I've been feeling the same! I got diagnosed about 2-3 weeks back. I'm already on antidepressants for my anxiety/depression + started taking new meds for ADHD.  Ever since I started on the ADHD meds I've been feeling a lot less anxious and stressed, but that also means the last minute panic that pushed me to finish some work is no longer there. So now I'm essentially struggling to keep myself motivated enough to finish my assignments ðŸ˜• it's nice to feel relaxed but also annoying cause I feel like I'm wayyyyy too relaxed"
