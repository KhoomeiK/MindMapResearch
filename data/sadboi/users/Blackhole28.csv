I feels way less palpitations and my heart beat usually stays below 100 now, and is usually between 70 and 90 (where previously I was always in tachycardia and was 100-120 just sitting there). It has helped with my anxiety in general as well. I‚Äôm still on Benzos but find myself using them less since I‚Äôve been on then beta blockers.

Your Physics courses begin usually needing the calculus math series. In the U.S that consists of Calculus I, II, and III. Some Physics classes also require Linear Algebra and Differential Equations. So you usually start off with Calculus courses before you actually get to Physics or Astro classes.

Personally, I started Community College being placed in Algebra 1. It took me a year or 2 to get to Calculus. I took Algebra 1, Algebra 2, Geometry, Trigonometry, and Pre Calculus.

I tried propranolol first, which wasn‚Äôt great, then found Metoprolol. I appreciate the concern though! Metoprolol has given me some of my life back and has been one of dozens of medications with a positive effect on my anxiety. (And yes I also go to therapy!)

I did post here before and I guess it was you who said that. My doctor said that the extended release 25mg means that there is 25mg at all times in the body.

loveafterporn,fgtdbg6,t3_f0coka,1581102997.0,I found out my boyfriend was masterbating to videos of my best friend and it hurt so bad. I also think about it every time I see her or her name pops up. I can‚Äôt really offer much advice. But I just wanted to let you know you aren‚Äôt alone and that all of your feelings are valid! It hurts .

AskDocs,ff4o75i,t1_ff4ftzj,1579568401.0,"So far I‚Äôve done them all except stress test. All normal. Although my Holter showed I was in sinus tachycardia most of the time. And when I was at urgent care one night hooked up to a heart monitor it registered some ‚Äúskipped‚Äù and ‚Äúdouble‚Äù beats. So my anxiety is causing physical irregularities. It‚Äôs so frustrating dealing with this and leaves me feeling so hopeless. My average heart rate is about 103. I never go below 80. Like, ever. And I‚Äôm usually around 100-105 just sitting on the couch doing nothing."

AskDocs,ff1mm0d,t1_ff1l3is,1579481683.0,"I‚Äôve tried CBT multiple times and it never seemed to work for me. I did it as a teen. I‚Äôve been getting back into it with my therapist. The problem now is I can‚Äôt talk myself over these heart issues. Or expose myself to anything that can help. I‚Äôm trying. I try meditation, mindfulness, I do everything my therapist says. Maybe one day I‚Äôll find the right thing. 

I scheduled a follow up with my doctor for Tuesday.

Thank you for your help and advice! I appreciate someone listening!!"

Here is the ECG device. https://imgur.com/a/jHIZwv8
It looks like the amazon link isn‚Äôt up any more but it has 4 ways to measure and comes with two wires and the sticky pads for your chest. 

As far as the fluids I was confused too. They gave me fluids and Ativan and I said ‚Äúwhy do I need the fluids?‚Äù And they said it would help to regulate my heart rate and calm me down/lower my blood pressure. I wasn‚Äôt dehydrated, my urine sample was nearly clear. And I‚Äôm fact giving me the fluids spiked my heart rate and blood pressure because I don‚Äôt like needles haha.

What are the other things that cause increased adrenaline? 

I‚Äôll have the results of the adrenal gland tumor soon. Doctor said he‚Äôs never seen anyone with it but I have some of the main symptoms (increased adrenaline, rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, anxiety, headaches, etc). 

If this is all anxiety do you have any advice? I‚Äôve tried every SSRI, I‚Äôve tried SNRI‚Äôs. I‚Äôve tried Buspar, Hydroxyzine, propranolol, pretty much anything for anxiety or off-label, and all that works is Benzos which they won‚Äôt give me daily. I was originally prescribed Xanax short term for a few months by a psychiatrist and then moved twice and each primary care doctor continued it based on my symptoms. My doctor said I have the worst case of anxiety he‚Äôs seen. I see a therapist who keeps recommending medicine to try and they don‚Äôt work. I feel broken. 

Also in general do you think I‚Äôd do well on a beta blocker for the tachycardia and such? I had taken the propranolol a few years ago and it scared me because my heart rate got so low (like 60-70 which is low for me) but thinking about trying again. The urgent care doctor was saying it would help pull me out of this constant adrenaline rush and may help the irregular beats and anxiety as well."

AskDocs,ff13q1i,t1_ff0wa36,1579474895.0,"Also this is completely random but could it be something I‚Äôm exposed to causing this? Me and my boyfriend and daughter moved into a new apartment in September and I‚Äôve been getting worse and worse since then. My boyfriend has also recently started having chest problems and breathing issues and such. My daughter seems fine though (or else I‚Äôd be more concerned). But could there be a mold issue? Or something else? Maybe it‚Äôs in our bedroom and not hers?

We went to visit some family in December and me and him both felt way better and I had nearly no heart problems for a few days. We were thinking it could be something in our apartment after that happened."
AskDocs,ff11lnj,t1_ff0wa36,1579474363.0,"This ECG was done with a personal ECG device I have. It has different ways of taking measurements. (With wires and pads, through palm and thumb, etc). These dips always show up. Also something I forgot to mention is my heart rate rapidly changes and does momentary dips. The other night at urgent care my heart was rapidly changing from 92, to 110, to 95, to 103, etc in seconds. It doesn‚Äôt stay still and my boyfriend even feels the changes through the pulse in my wrist. 

Half of the time my heart is in sinus rhythm, half the time is sinus tachycardia. I also forgot to mention everything gets worse at night and when laying down for some reason. Both the event monitor and Holter monitor showed up with night time sinus tachycardia. 

I have not been sleeping well without the Ativan. It feels like I have a constant adrenaline rush that doesn‚Äôt go away. I lay in bed with my eyes wide open and my body won‚Äôt shut off. I literally pulled two all nighters in the past few weeks. 

Regularly I wake up feeling fine but for the past few weeks where everything has been worse it does normally start up first thing in the morning. Today it was while still in bed. 

I don‚Äôt ever have severe crushing pain or pass out but I do feel chest pains, trouble breathing for a breath or two, my throat feels tight, my right eardrum goes numb (I know! It‚Äôs random), my chest gets tight and gets pressure, tingling or numbness. But not unbearable. My throat gets fluttery. 

My blood pressure is not usually this high. I‚Äôm normally low blood pressure if anything. During these last few weeks I‚Äôve been averaging pretty high but that day I was crazy high at urgent care. They immediately gave me fluids and I slowly came down to 118 over a few hours. 

Also I don‚Äôt know if it matters but even on Benzos my heart rate doesn‚Äôt go less than 80. I can‚Äôt remember the last time my heart rate was less that 80 and when it does I feel like I‚Äôm going to faint. 

I would be happy with my current diagnosis if I knew for sure it was my anxiety but lately it‚Äôs been completely separate and people around me notice. My boyfriend has been living with me through my anxiety and can always tell exactly how I‚Äôm feeling and if I‚Äôm anxious and even he said he can tell I‚Äôm not anxious and the heart stuff starts first. It‚Äôs frustrating for me because the doctors won‚Äôt listen as well because they know I have bad anxiety but at the same time I just wish I knew it was my anxiety. And if it is anxiety how is it doing this to my body? It‚Äôs literally killing me. That doesn‚Äôt seem okay.

I have taken every medicine you can think of for anxiety and nothing takes it away except Benzos and even then I get the palpitations through them. I just feel like I‚Äôm starting to lose hope that I‚Äôll be fixed and I‚Äôm almost hoping they find something wrong with my heart to explain it. 

Thank you for your response!"
cringe,ff0yonn,t1_ff0v9ye,1579473576.0,This is WAY beyond what Richard Dawson ever did. Not to mention they were older women and usually okay with it. These kids straight up state they aren‚Äôt okay with it. You can‚Äôt even compare the two side by side.

Also yeah I know this was more the norm back then but this is way beyond what Richard Dawson did. This is straight up cringe.
