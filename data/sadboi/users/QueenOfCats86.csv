And yes, definitely eat healthier and watch your portion sizes, that’s what will really help you lose weight.

It’s hard to say how soon you will see a difference, because it varies from person to person depending how you carry your weight. If you lose a pound or half a kilo a week that’s a good healthy amount. I really recommend taking a before photo or ideally a few, so that you can compare them as you lose weight, sometimes it’s hard to see weight loss on yourself so side by side photos is a great way to see how far you’ve come"
