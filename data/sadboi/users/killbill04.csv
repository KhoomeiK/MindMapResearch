Tarantino,f1bpsnb,t1_f1bl8em,1569340219.0,"well remove yourself from it for a second. you said the excessive blood is just not your style. qt didn't invent the style. try to understand the deeper essence of that genre and how he elevated it. dismissing kill bill because of the blood just seems like a juvenile thing to do considering there is a whole era of these films that can be appreciated and valued... and they *are* appreciated and valued.

the way he used so many styles. used so many styles well. used so many styles well and meshed them together beautifully. the scenes. the great scenes in kill bill are pound for pound the best scenes in all of the history of cinema. The snow garden scene is literally the best scene in the history of all of film imho. the story. the story is incredible. Shooting action is the hardest thing to do in film, and he fucking DID IT. kill bill is QT hitting at ALL CYLINDERS. Its his best work to date, technically speaking. QT has not ever topped Kill Bill and he never will touch it ever again. The exact reason I think he needs to leave it alone. It's perfect."
