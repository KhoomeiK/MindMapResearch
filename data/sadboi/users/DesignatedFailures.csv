Doing that will make a lot of sites default to spanish without needing a vpn. But it might be annoying changing the setting back and forth all the time.

So what you can do is set up a new browser or a new profile on chrome or firefox to browse spanish, save bookmarks, sign into sites with Spanish accounts you make. 

Just search keywords, read spanish sites, click outbound links from thise sites. Ask your random questions that haunt you in the middle of the night,  like ""what is the meaning of life? or ""do flies have teeth?"" in Spanish and see what comes up. 

Search keywords for topics you are already interested in or know a lot about already in English. Just search for whatever you would already be doing. Knowing about a topic already makes something a lot easier to read and to guess new words from context.

Realizing that being depressed at home is a lot better than being depressed and socially anxious while doing something that is supposed to make you happy but isn't. Which may induce feeling guilty, ungrateful, hopelessness,  self hatred, anxiety, while at home all you felt was depressed.  So now all you feel is numb inside, and the Eiffel tower seems more like a good place to jump off of than to sight see.

Stepping outside of your comfort zone and realizing you weren't prepared or had the resources to do that. Having panic attacks, breakdowns, or dissociation in public. People making fun of you and/or asking you if you are ok. Failing at whatever you try to do because you never dealt with your anxiety or depression before going ""out of your comfort zone"". And the only potentially positive effect is realizing ""wow my mental health is much worse than I thought, maybe I should get help""

Ending up in abusive friendships, relationships and risky situations when you start saying ""yes"" to life, because you start to realize a lot of ""no's"" you had before were actually healthy boundaries that other people didn't like because it meant they couldn't use you as easily. 

Realizing that the main changes that come from eating healthy and exercising is that, it took you from a depressed couch potato to a potato that is now moving and eating salad. But now you are no longer getting your dopamine from food, and since you have no other dopamine of your own. Your brain is now either going to seek out other unhealthy sources of dopamine, or you are going to relapse, break down, and eat 3 pizzas by yourself while crying and feeling out of control of your life.

If the band is 36 inches, then the cup sizes would go up roughly 1 inch per cup size. So a measurment of 37/36 (1 in difference) would be A 38/36 (2 in difference) would be B, 39/36 (3 in difference) would be C 40/36(4in difference) is D.

So someone who measured their band as 36 and their bust as 42 would keep the 36 as their band size, and the cup/band difference comes out to 6, making it a roughly an F. .

Lets say that our 37/36 A cup individual lost weight and went down to a 30in waist, but their breasts stayed exactly the same size/mass. Their measurment is now 37/30, which means  those same A cup breasts are now F cups, but their mass and weight has stayed exactly the same.

Someome with a tiny frame could be an F, and while their breasts would be relatively large on their frame, with a big difference of several inches bust/band circumfrence, the actual mass/weight might not be as much as you would think for what most people imagine as a ""F"".

Comparing cup size only works for mass when the people being compared are of the same, or very similar band sizes to begin with.

They might realize that being a god who can fly is ridiculous, but obama reading their mail might still be something they feel strongly (but knowingly) irrationally paranoid about, but their partner swapping all of their old socks with exact replicas weekly might be something that gets through their lucidity during the episode, and they might not care enough that she's doing that to even say anything at the time. 

So no one would have any idea the delusions or hallucinations they are having at the time  since they learned ways to cope on their own during their life. Its probably more common with people suffering untreated from a young age, but they still had  to adapt around the disorder to survive.

 So high functioning people with untreated schizophrenia exist in society, but you don't see them because they are high functioning and aren't included in stastics because they never sought help.

If you look up pretty much any emotional issues online or look up abuse or how to spot a narcissist etc most things online are talking about it in the context of romantic relationships. But that's just because the internet itself is always talking about romantic and sexual relationships. But borderline absolutely effects friendships and family relationships, and for a lot of people it might even be their makn area of worry when it comes to interacting with people and the pain they experience with their disorder.

The biggest traits borderlines share is an inability to express their emotions in healthy ways. So they either shut down entirely and dissociate or the just blow up at people or do other destructive shit. And usually it goes black and white betwren those two extremes. Seeing the world in black and white is the biggest symptom of the dosorder. And the treatment is learning how to healthily express emotions wothout letting them blow out of proportion, and learning to see the world in shades of grey.

And it's usually caused by childhood trauma and growing up in a dysfunctional environment where the child learns its unsafe to express their feelings and they are wrong or bad if they have any needs other than making their authority figures happy. So they never really learn how to be a functioning person. And all the birderline symptoms are just maladaptive coping mechanisms. Basically behavior they learned that helped in the fucked up environment, but is making their life and relationships (friends, family, romantic) hell now."

Hypothetically a demon couldn't lie and say that just you to trick you? And does the demon have to flee if you say that even if you don't believe the words you are saying, the words are enough?

Although now that I think of it, I have had a fervent believer try to cast the ""demons"" out of me. As annoying and cringey as it was at the time, thanks to your post, knowing those traits didn't go away even under those circumstances, I guess whatever left behind must just be naturally me! 

I think its actually an incredible idea to use the Christian stuff to combat the Christian stuff. After all, you can't reason yourself out of something you didn't reason yourself into in the first place. 

This is probably the closest thing that has helped lift some weight off of the latent irrational emotional feelings. I think it helps in a weird ""worst case scenario"" type of way. Like if it is true, no one can argue that you didn't try your best. And God can't say, ""oh well actually that was really a demon, even though I told you how to tell if its a demon, and my own test doesn't even work. 🤷‍♀️"" I mean he could, and he probably *would* if he was real.  It wouldn't be the first time he did something like that. But in this hypothetical scenario it makes a lot of sense in its  own weird way."

exchristian,fcaupwy,t1_fc9q3p0,1577576987.0,"What I was taught? The reason incest is bad is because it leads to inbreeding.  Back in the day the human genome was perfect, and now adays its full of errors. So back then a little bit of inbreeding was ok because humans had 100% perfect genes. Humans used to be 10ft tall and had brains 10x bigger than they do now and were basically super human.  Incest is bad today because we dont have very many percentage points we can afford to lose with inbreeding because we are all inbred (edit:although this is partially true thanks to the population bottleneck humans went through in the past) and losing points with every incest generation. 

This isn't how genetics works. This isn't how anything works. I wish I was joking.

Edit:All of these responses have the utter insanity all flooding back to me. I And this is the stuff they want to be teaching in schools.(and do teach in private evangelical schools). 

I've known people raised atheist  joke that what would creationism science even teach? God made the world. The end. Shortest course ever. And I just sit ther being like.

truechildfree,fbwh0jy,t1_fbw7irb,1577149696.0,"You aren't wrong that parents do more harm under the guise of helping, but it's a dangerous mindset to invalidate someones fear that they might hurt themself or someone else. Being aware doesn't make someone less likely to do it, but it's a cry for help that needs to be listened to, because something isn't right if someone is pushed into having thoughts like that. The only reason it might make it less likely is that it might lead them to get help. But simply being aware doesn't just make it go away. Knowing you are hallucinating doesn't make it go away, antipsychotics do. Knowing you have a headache doesnt make it go away, aspirin does. Someone knowing they need to lose weight isn't enough or even more likely to make it work.

When non-insane people keep perpetuating this, all the insane people see is that their kids *aren't* dying, and the kids of their friends *aren't* dying, and it just makes them less likely to take sane people seriously.

I grew up with anti-vax parents, and never knew of a kid who died from it. It's still incredibly important to get vaccinated for a million reasons, including how fragile herd immunity really is and the damage that can be done to that important safety net that we have in place for babies, the elderly, and the immunocompromised who can't safely get vaccinations for whatever reason. 

I'm not defending anti-vaxers. I was still terrified that I would get the measles and die or something pretty much every day of my childhood that I knew what vaccines were.  I would argue and fight all the time over the science of it and try to convince them to let me get them done.I was pretty much this 13yo kid in the OP who wants to get it done. But I'm not dead, and I know that bringing that fear up to an anti-vaxer has zero effect on how they see the world, or on convincing them that what they are doing is insane. They just have no reason to believe it from their experience. Even if they are just leeching off of the net that was put in place for the vulnerable.

The increase in that sort of behavior would only be the symptom. 

The only way it would really get *worse* is if you got dependent on using it to deal with stuff instead of using more effective coping mechanisms, but there is nothing intrinsically wrong with it. 

Like alcoholics don't just become alcoholics because they drink sometimes, or even a lot. (Physical dependence isn't the same thing as psychological addiction though they overlap) They become alcoholics when they start using it to deal with stresses in their life and it becomes an unhealthy coping mechanism for stuff that could be dealt with in other ways, but they just haven't developed other ways since they relied on drinking so much."
GamerGhazi,f1z2s3z,t3_daysy7,1569831871.0,"It really shows how naive it is for people to think that child sexual abuse and incest and their resulting developmental conditions as an adult,  rare, or something that doesn't happen very often. It's a lot more common than people think, the odds are high that you even know someone who was sexually abused as a child. The internet is just making this type of thing more visible. 

In first dsm it was stated that child sexual abuse/incest was so rare that it basically never happened, so don't take it seriously if patients tell you they were abused in that way. Something like 1 in 3 million. But now we know that the numbers are something more like 1 in 5 children. In Japan for example,  which has rates that are ridiculously low compared to the rest of the world, but when they installed a crisis helpline for victims, it was instantly overwhelmed with calls showing that the numbers themselves are incredibly underestimated everywhere. 

Nobody believes children and by the time the child is old enough to be believed or even old enough to know anything was wrong (often times that child is now an adult) it's too late. there is no evidence they have access too, sometimes the statute of limitations is up, and the types of trauma relatad disorders that tend to develop from this particularly sickening type of abuse also make remembering and processing the things that happened to them more difficult."
menwritingwomen,f16vma9,t1_f164blf,1569225760.0,"That makes me think that if the science behind organ cloning from stem-cells becomes more advanced, and transwomen can basically make themselves a uterus using their own genetics, and once that is in place in the body, the hormones would be able to do the rest. 

It's fine if you don't feel comfortable answering, but  do you experience stuff like cramps in other parts of your body? Bloating? Fatigue? Diarrhea? Body aches/muscle weakness? A lot of these things happen during the period because the chemicals released to cause fertility and muscle contractions of the uterus also get sent out throughout the entire body (because the body is stupid) and it effects all those other systems too. 

Even during the times I don't get my period, but my hormones are still in flux I end up getting something like a ""ghost period"" where everything happens except for the period itself. So it would make sense to me for a lot of trans women to experience all the same stuff. Basically the hormones sending out the signals to the rest of the body, but just no uterus there to pick up the call (yet.)"
