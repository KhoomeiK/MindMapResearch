AnimalCrossing,fq5h5tm,t3_ggpzoa,1589105240.0,"The only villager I have hated was Cesar. I have some sought after ones (Marina, Audie) and some incredibly underrated ones (Vic, Portia, Filbert). Vic is low-key my favourite, I ignored him bc I was disappointed and he moved in without me asking and the first thing he said was ""everyone avoids me because they're scared of me but I just want to make friends"" (or something similar) and now I'm never letting him go"

Yeah people make the edges, corner pieces and middle pieces, just have a search for some creator codes :) 

I have some really pretty pebble/stones for a foresty area (made by someone else) if you want me to dm it to you? I saw a video on here with loads of floor designs"

AnimalCrossing,fp3iyuk,t3_gb3x24,1588280119.0,"I know the feeling. I never keep my first attempt. I did the same thing and much prefer my new island. I find that custom paths (like rock paths and separate planks) really help bring the island together. 

But like the others have said, play for you, at your own pace. It's not meant to be a compare yourself to others, stressful game :)"
AmItheAsshole,fo3upq5,t3_g5cw6w,1587493265.0,"NAH - As many others have said, this does sound like disordered behaviour. I am like this with food. And believe me, it's distressing. She probably hates that she's possessive over food, and probably feels guilty that she's like this with your 3 year old. But when it's a child that wants the food, you can't deny it. You can't explain this to a 3 year old. You're not an asshole for feeding your child."
BipolarReddit,fntj9e2,t1_fnti3k3,1587242771.0,I'm glad things are better for you now. Seroquel is seen as the first point of call (in the UK at least) so they don't like you coming off it in my experience. And thank you!  Sending virtual support to you too :) are you on anything now?
BipolarReddit,fntf9te,t1_fnsd2d2,1587240479.0,I very much relate to this. I had to take myself off it as I couldn't physically look after my 1 year old or go to work. Now on the waiting list to see the psychiatrist again bc he kindly discharged me even though I said I can't live like that.

BipolarReddit,fmz9m1i,t3_fy64n5,1586511870.0,"I was on the depo injection for a year and it was the worst year of my life mentally. It made my moods more severe and my ED worse - all I could focus on was food and all I did was exercise. I got hospitalized twice due to severe and rapid mood swings. I lost a 5y relationship, my place on my PhD course and my job. I've not been on contraception since and now have a one year old but the depo was not worth it for me"

It's empty there now. Just goes to show how much munchies and people abusing the system needlessly go into a&e when they know they don't need to be there.

AmItheAsshole,fgigkb4,t3_ey9wsy,1580820963.0,NTA. She could have told you beforehand so you could have had alternative drinks ready for her without her stealing focus. It was your day and she could have handled it better - she had plenty of time afterwards to have the support for her pregnancy. Congratulations on your marriage though x
BipolarReddit,fgig9h2,t3_eye59c,1580820685.0,"Support worker - working in one residence with the same people on the same shifts and activities each week (no sleeps or night shifts). The predictability makes it mostly low stress. Of course people can be stressful at times, I think I have it okay.

It's only a very high stress job when they load you with hours, ring you every day asking for extra and sending you to new places. I have requested set hours to avoid all this though but it can get very hectic to the point I took a month off last year."
