Hadn't had a kit since I sold my Gretsch Renown 6 years ago because of space and apartment living. Hadn't even had space for an electric until now. It feels so good to be back, I never want to be drumless again. 

What's that little module you have it plugged into?"

It's hard when you put yourself out there but people don't draw you out. It almost feels like they don't want to really know the real you. Which makes you think if they did know the real you they wouldn't like you. So you may as well not get tacos, because it's superficial.

Hope you're doing well."
