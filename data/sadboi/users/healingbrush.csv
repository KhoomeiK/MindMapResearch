It has a controversial title. It suggests a radical approach and it makes bold propositions and claims (as I said, stretches). However, I don't find it unbelievable and untrustworthy. One, because it asks, in my opinion, necessary questions, as oftentimes BPD sufferers happen to have been subjected to trauma, as research shows, and symptoms between BPD and CPTSD do overlap. Two, I think this should be called an opinion piece and obviously it isn't an official statement by a leading organization/researchers on the subject (it's not a news article either), however it IS written by a licensed psychologist, who works in the field and has direct experience with sufferers, so it's not exactly just ""someone"" on the internet without any experience or knowledge.

Of course, not all therapists are to be trusted. I find her message rather humanizing than dangerous, but that's my perspective and I don't mind it being challenged.
