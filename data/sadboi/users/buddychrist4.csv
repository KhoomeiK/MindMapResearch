kratom,fohccgl,t3_g7765e,1587763591.0,"Congrats my friend. I hope that kratom offers you comfort and stability.
150gm in a week while detoxing is commendable, that‚Äôs about 20gm per day. I think it‚Äôs fine. You can easily cut back from that, if you want. No dosing shame here."
kratom,fo0267l,t3_fn1xto,1587404771.0,"Sorry for late jump into this thread. I would say in my experience you wouldn‚Äôt feel any effect from kratom, if you have buprenorphine - Suboxone, in your system. That drug is pretty effective in latching onto the same opiate receptors that kratom will try to stimulate."
kratom,fl7g6gu,t1_fl77mff,1584901056.0,"Excellent post, backed up with data. My experience kratom and suboxone (buprenorphine) have similar mechanism of action. Small amounts of either result in a pleasant effect. Dose higher and the antagonist action block those effects."
DHgate,fj40mxl,t3_fben4t,1582997546.0,"I have had 4 orders ship in the last week or so. The seller is based in Guangzhou. But the tracking shows they are all stuck in Korea. 
So I would recommend being patient, 
Some seller are shipping, but as even after items ships, they could encounter delays."
kratom,fihiirh,t3_f7t9nn,1582410773.0,"I thought kratom wasn‚Äôt water soluble, which is one reason ethyl alcohol is used to make extract? So one can extract some (most?) of the alkaloids using water?"
DHgate,fi27zqy,t3_f4hfnk,1582073579.0,Yes. I had 2 orders shipped out over the weekend.
DHgate,fi0a361,t3_f5blb1,1582031544.0,"I actually had two ship yesterday, both are in Guangzhou"
DHgate,fhyl0lh,t3_f5blb1,1581978094.0,"One shipped today, three others still delayed, but was encouraging to see that one finally on its way after about 6 weeks.
I am also fine waiting for the others, these folks are dealing with a lot"
RepTime,fhpstio,t3_f48cjr,1581794697.0,Date window looks spot on. Those $70 DHGate jobs have it half inch into the dial.

DHgate,fho956d,t3_f3cifo,1581745915.0,"Ask the seller, good ones are upfront about telling you that.
it depends on the item, I doubt they care US or U.K. stock of fake Rollex, Gucci items, so be sure to let them know what you looking for.
DHGate has developed an area on the site that takes you to goods that can be shipped form U.K. or US wear houses. Much of that is heavy or bulky items, sent in advance via ocean freight shipping."
DHgate,fhl6aly,t3_f3qtrm,1581695955.0,"I have four orders pending since late July. Most of the vendors have been very good communicating with me, although there isn‚Äôt much they can say. Information doesn‚Äôt exactly flow freely in China, so they are in the dark as much as we are.
I am just writing those orders off in my mind for at least a few months. They will sent order out eventually. I can‚Äôt imagine what it‚Äôs like living there right now.
Apple, car manufacturers are all in an even worse way. They can‚Äôt get parts or produce goods."
kratom,fhedf05,t3_f2qg5g,1581519951.0,"I use a highly calibrated Chinese takeout spoon, with the end bent at a precise 30 degree curve."
kratom,fh5eerx,t3_f1ekdl,1581288133.0,"My understanding is that some extract shots or capsules (no naming names, I know) are equivalent to 7 grams of kratom leaf.  I didn‚Äôt get from the thread how much of that OP was taking, but absolutely concur extracts will F up your tolerance, not to mention your wallet. 
I keep those to once a week,"
kratom,fgztjsq,t3_f0scg0,1581197519.0,"If I am taking kratom, a pot of French press coffee gives me a chubby. Sex, not so much"
bipolar,fgugvtu,t3_f0dj9c,1581120493.0,"Both Lithium and lamictal, fairly stout dosages of 1350 and 250 mg.
That combo keeps me on the rails for the most part. I am very grateful to have found them, and the right dosage (this is important). Lots and lots of trial and error to get to this point."
kratom,fgh9gn4,t3_eybvsj,1580779792.0,"Not for me. ‚ÄúWhite vein‚Äù puts me to sleep. Keeping with other comments, red or brown is useless. Maybe because of the way it‚Äôs dried?
I try to communicate with my vendor, and have him send what he feels is the best. 
It‚Äôs all in the leaf size and selection, other factors that can make a strain, batch actually, stronger (per vendor). It‚Äôs not the color or the name they give it."
kratom,fezl1tl,t3_eqw6ax,1579458464.0,"My experience is that if I have kratom in my system, it will effectively block other opiates. 
I was taking about 12‚Äì15gms per day and had dental surgery, given 10 mg hydrocodone pills. I swear I took two of those, felt nothing.
That‚Äôs 20 mg which is a hefty dose to anyone intolerant, which I guess I don‚Äôt qualify as. 
So two things from that: one I don‚Äôt need prescription narcotics to manage moderate pain. Kratom is amazingly effective for me.
The second thing however, is if you need serious pain relief, you probably want to ease off the kratom, as it seems to block even hefty doses of opiates/opioids."
kratom,fcz9i4d,t3_ejmq33,1578096390.0,"Weed, or anything else for that matter, overpowers kratom for me."
kratom,fcsvlad,t1_fcqw3ms,1577926225.0,"Stem and Vein has helped me taper off regular leaf in the past, my vendor recommended that to me. He told me there are Different alkaloids in the part of the lead they normally remove. The powder has an almost white color. 
I have no idea if that is true, but as I said, I changed over almost immediately to stem and vein powder, then dropped off that after about a week (12-15gm a day kratom habit). It really wasn‚Äôt too bad. 
I should note I am on a relatively heavy dose of gabapentin (1600 mg) which I am prescribed for nerve pain. So that might ease WD as well."
kratom,fc59r3o,t3_eg583o,1577450188.0,"I read once that the main alkaloids in kratom are not water soluble. Would making a tea, straining out all the leaf, work?"
RecreationalKratom,fbsdzes,t3_edx9mi,1577053947.0,"Kratom blocks out other opiates/opioids in my case. I much prefer the pain relief and overall sense of well being from kratom, and don‚Äôt mix it with anything other than coffee."
BipolarReddit,fb64hhm,t3_ebf0xl,1576541162.0,"Very good advice and reminder. I always carry enough meds to last a week in my computer bag, which is always with me when I travel. I forgot my regular RX bottles over thanksgiving, and was glad to have that emergency supply with me."
kratom,fafmkd5,t3_e8w7dy,1576026542.0,"I use an empty RX bottle, put 2gm powder in along with warm, hot water, be sure to put a little water in before powder so it doesn‚Äôt stick. Put cap on, shake (gentle or it will leak). Down sludge. I don‚Äôt really mind taste of kratom, this method probably isn‚Äôt best for those that do. 
My main method is capping 00 gel caps. It‚Äôs very consistent .6gms, I can cap a weeks worth in 15 min or so. Just a lot more convenient when traveling and less potential mess."
kratom,f56dxaa,t3_dmrusb,1572021995.0,"This will seem odd, but I take gabapentin for nerve pain, I find it very synergistic with kratom"
kratom,f4jzf43,t3_dko35h,1571630115.0,"As several folks have said, buy your kratom online from one of the higher rated redit vendors, rather than a head shop. You will pay $100 per kg compared to the nearly dollar per gram headshop price. I will have a $15 Capsule machine off eBay, 1000 empty gelatin OO caps for $10 (best size imo as they hold about half a gram each), 
it‚Äôs a tedious process of capping kratom powder, but I can make a days supply (12 gm) in 5 to 10 min. I prefer capsules over powder for convenience sake, I actually don‚Äôt mind the taste of the stuff, but carrying around and dosing powder when you are out all day is a headache,"
