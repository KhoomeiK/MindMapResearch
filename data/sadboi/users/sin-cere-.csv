This a video from R/Lebanon subreddit when we entered our 5-15 year state of war. That our government is full of warlords, it is somewhat true.  Every-time that I think about it, I think of Robert McNamara’s lesson; “Rationality will not save us.” Because he does convey the message beyond of the lines that ‘when rationality is absent, it calls for calculated belligerent men to meet it’s desired destination, regardless of the casualties.’ I’m Paraphrasing of course, because the obscure quote i heard is much more smarter and insightful than that.  

I digress. I suggest reading wiki pages of the [Lebanese civil war ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Civil_War) for a brief read all the back to the beginning of the absolute garbage.

These blokes ARE NOTHING LIKE Brazilians Lebanese, these cunts are obnoxious degenerates. Half of the people (their parents and grandparents) that migrated in the late 60’s to late 80’s are absolute fucking idiots, who didn’t know how properly (for example, like the dad who constantly hits his sons to keep them in line. but the kids end-ups being the school bully with a future criminal record, unsurprisingly.) to raise and discipline children. In other words exempt from my frustrations, they were Completely uneducated leading to a large-scale of failure towards assimilating into Australian society for decades. Including their children. 

The Lebanese here, are stereotypically regarded as compulsive liars, thieves, degrading pigs that causally sexual harass white women because they think they’re all sluts, greedy backstabbers, etc. 

And it’s a genuine ache to my heart. Before we used to be considered “exotic” now because of those scums, we’re an encumbrance taken with a sigh at our collective expanse. 

For further clarification. I lived and in suburb that must’ve been 75% Lebanese, and went to the local high school. Fucking hated it.  They try to convert every non Muslim to Islam, and indoctrinate them to be Lebanese. every-time that a person that said no, was regarded as a fucking dog. And so much other shit that has put our culture in-vain. It’s soul crushing due to the impression it has bred for 100,000s Australians across the states. Then I moved to a suburb that was predominantly white, it upsets me to say it. I’m more comfortable living here than there. Because I’m a far less likely to get robbed, and be annoyed by those degenerates. 

However I’d say they make up like 10 percent of the Lebanese population in Sydney( who I consider as dishonourable human beings). But Christ, it’s notable enough for a cunt like me to bitch about and agree with white people who may or may not be racist. Sheer disappointment. They need an intervention."

(However, the woman  now mostly tolerates gay people) 

I don’t hold that stance now, I was homophobic until 4 years ago. I didn’t register gays were human beings until I watched a documentary how a gay couple raised abandoned orphans. 

As I reflect on it now, I realised a lot of homophobia steams from fear and discriminatory indoctrination. People like that are taught gays are a disease to themselves who are ought to be punished in the afterlife, and to always stay away from them. 

Blokes like that are dangerously miseducated and fearful of gay people. They’re out of touch with why people are gay, and think they’re right because (gays) they’re punished brutally in the Islamic world.  They have the wrong motives, but they just don’t know it.

And what is your point precisely? That Lebanese people, like to party and so-on, is the sole reason why there are protests in the country over the past 6 months ? Well, by that logic. 

That must explain why their parliament is consisted mostly of oligarchs, part of the top 200 families that control the country, why over 50% of people under 30 can’t find a full-time job in the country, why 10,000s of people go through bins looking for bread to eat, how poorly their economy is being handled by having the second debt ratio in the world, shutting down programs to help make down-syndrome people contributing members of society, and finally, why people are committing suicide over it. 

Allow me to reiterate my favourite comment on the matter, by a redditor. 


“-half of the country's population is out of work, and the other half is barely making any living

-youth are leaving the country after graduation

-taxes are always rising (with no improvement!), and most can't afford to live

-there's no clean water accessible for all

-electricity is only available for a few hours during the day. So you either pay for a generator company, or you make do without electricity (a monopoly on generators to make sure electricity stays limited on day) 

-politicians have been caught on multiple occasions using taxpayers money for their personal gain (their net worth are in the billions of USD) 

-country is run by corrupt officials and thieves, who each basically have their own militia and blind followers that suppress anyone who dares speak against them 

-it's only an an illusion of democracy, it's more of a sectoral dynasty and the same people have been in power for years (quasi-aristocracy and pseudo-democracy) 

-the healthcare is expensive as hell 

-incredible pollution all over the country (the government does not fund to a service to clean up years worth of garbage outside of city) 

-economy is basically destroyed, country faces huge debt burdens (one of the largest in the world)

-the infrastructure is crumbling 

-the country's currency may be gone for good, no one wants lbp (due to the officials stealing)

-banks are not letting anyone withdraw their money in usd, trying to prevent the dip in lbp, and probably because there isn't enough

-this isn't new, it's been getting worse for years now, but yesterday was the last straw when they decided to tax whatsapp, a usually free service

-thousands of Lebanese are protesting all over the country, with closed down roads: the whole country is basically shut down

-we demand the resignation of every single politician, every single one

-this isn't just a protest, this is a revolution. After a long deafening silence, the prime minister and minister of affairs went on tv today to address what's happening, and they basically spat out straight bullshit and the ministry of affairs threatened us in a passive aggressive way. He said that he ""supports"" us but gave us two options: 1. he's not gonna resign and he will try to fix things (note: he's been saying this for over a decade). 2. we don't comply and try to make him resign which he will not do, but he promised an even worse state for the country

There's a lot more shit I didn't cover, but I think this should do so you can understand why we're doing this. As you can see, it's pretty bad. We know it's hard to give a shit because we're a 3rd world country, but please try and spread the word. That's all we ask for.” 

Even by that logic, Lebanese-Brazilians are arguably their best immigrants into country. Assimilating almost as well as the Portuguese. Still a very flawed observation, mate. Because quite a lot of them become doctors and probably move to North America, and have secondary courses in politics becoming bureaucrats and parliament members. 

It doesn’t take a genius to realise that Eastern European countries, are the most corrupt governments in all of Europe. Where the embezzlement is unmeasurable, and hundreds of journalists every year, are arrested making objective reports about it. The failures can’t be solely directed to their uneducated and misguided people, it’s far more complex than that. 

In conclusion; you’ve greatly underestimated what are the problems with Lebanon, creating a straw-man  fallacy and generalising the issues because they like to dance. You’ve cracked the case Sherlock, maybe they’ll stop setting themselves ablaze with molotovs (because of the economy)now.

worldnews,fguespv,t1_fguc58z,1581119042.0,"I wholeheartedly agree with you, and your sentiments.  But practicality wise, the Venezuelan economy will not alleviate from the recession for a decade or so until someone favourable like Juan Guadió, is appointed by means of coup d’état (extremely unlikely since Maduro has an extremely loyal military), puppet state by foreign forces (U.S), or using media to secure the election.  

I watched a ‘TheGrayZone’ video of a compilation of Guadió at his failed rallies, lying to public,and deceiving the media, it’s brilliant. But I digress.  

Venezuela aren’t able to overcome those sanctions. If a puppet like Guadió comes in, kicks out the Chinese and Russians, paying nothing for the debt they’ve paid, completely privatise the oil sector to Shell and Exxon Mobile. With that being stated I don’t see way how Venezuela can overcome this. They’re going to be figuratively strangled into pressure, until the U.S demands are met. No one can stop them.  Sure it’s horrible, but hopefully it’ll stop creating millions of Venezuelan refugees leaving droves across the Americas.  I’m looking at this at practicality view, this is the one thing I could see. 

Venezuela’s only hope is if Bernie wins the presidency; because he’ll loosen the sanction noose on them."

worldnews,fgte0iu,t1_fgt1i29,1581103202.0,"Given the fact Venezuela’s hyperinflation rate is still over 10,000,000%, and you’ll need to carry a barrel of bolivars, in order to buy an apple. Not the most happy accident. 

Venezuela’s economy is almost entirely dependent on exportation of entirely nationalised crude oil. but with my observations, it seems the Russians are only helping them out by a modicum with this deal, Russia is the real winner. I suppose the Venezuelan’s are selling the oil at a fix price, better than nothing. But it won’t solve the issues until those sanctions are gone. maybe their gold and lithium mining deals, with China and Russia will alleviate their issues, momentarily. 

The sanctions has certainly accumulated stronger economic ties with them especially since Juan Guaidó, is trying to lead an overthrow of the government for almost 2 years, with the support of western governments.  

In conclusion; I don’t see a bright future for their economy under Maduro . with Guiadó definitely, at the expense trading with Russian oil and mining  companies, to solely Shell and Exxon Moblie.

I know this sounds cliche and unoriginal, but do you have a person where you can express your feelings and thoughts without being left high and dry, after the convo ?

Because no deserves to be left feeling numb, high and dry, and Suicidal. You emotions and thoughts deserves to be acknowledged, not avoided and discarded by someone irrelevant. I know you’re just some bloke/chick who longs for day of their demise. But dude, I don’t want to see you get hurt, especially as much you want to see yourself get hurt, to substitute your emotional pain for physical pain. You deserve closure not self harm, mate.  That also applies to anyone reading this, who emphasises with you. 

My grammar might be off because I’ve been for the past 14, hours. And I’m struggling to think coherently. And probably going delete this when I wake up later. 

How you handle your humour, with my observations. is actually more healthy than damaging.  

I don’t usually this, nonetheless. Hit me up in the PM’s. I am by no means an expert on human emotions and mental states, but I might emphasise on quite things with you. I fall asleep as if I’ll never wakeup again, for instance. 

Take care, lad. Stay safe."
