atheism,foneiay,t3_g8gjd6,1587917952.0,Wait you say is a catholic organization my family is also part of one that is very cult like and honestly they both sound the same if you need someone to talk to I'm here. I think I undertand what you're going thru. It sound very similar to my situation.
atheism,fofp71b,t1_fofhoub,1587740333.0,"Thank you for your perspective:) I have tried many times actually to speak up but it always leads to violence. My familys religion is a bit difficult to explain and it may sound weird. its  a form of very extreme Christianity. It's like a separate group, but they do have catholic fundemnatlas. The big difference are that they beleive they are better than people that just go to regular Sunday mass and honestly it's really hard to explain, I'm sorry if it sounds crazy. I may not be religious but I truly do respect other peoples beliefs, but I guess what makes it hard to talk to my parents is that they will disown me for explaining to them its hurting me and it will lead to violence. Thank you so much for your perspective though :) it was very helpful to see things in a different light have a good day."

atheism,foei7we,t1_foehqbi,1587704441.0,I have bipolar disorder type one and the reason why it affects me is because for years I was neglected mental help which lead to me falling into a worse hole. And when they talk about how I will go to hell it triggers me to disassociate which has led to realt bad things that I cant really talk about. I also a teenager but very soon I'll be considered a legal adult. Soeey I cant give so much detail it's just something that's hard to talk about without me getting triggered.
atheism,foehmko,t1_foegysf,1587704002.0,I guess what really makes it hard is that my parents are very religious to the point where it can get violent if I say something that's bad
