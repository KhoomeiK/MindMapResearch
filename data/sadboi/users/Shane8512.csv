FutureMan,fn0td45,t1_fn0s61z,1586548364.0,"Yeah. I told all my friends about it but they still didn't watch it. If it's not on Netflix then they dont watch it.
I love Rick and Morty but its easier to like. People love Cartoons."
FutureMan,fn0rezj,t3_fyjxur,1586547315.0,"I feel like if they wanted it to carry on they would have. They've known for quite sometime that the 3rd would be the final season. Yeah they wanted more probably but why do this now. Why not a years ago when they first said it was cancelled. 

I love the show but it's done. I mean they didn't even make 13 episodes like the previous 2 seasons. 

Now if Netflix got hold of the show it would probably be a different story. 

So I support you but my opinion is it's dead."
datingoverthirty,fmyo4eh,t1_fmxxyqq,1586490989.0,Yeah. I can see that as a turn off.

SCREENPRINTING,fmw4h8i,t3_fxnows,1586439330.0,"Yeah. As everyone is saying. Dont do the order. Try and print onto new Shirts. You would have to get each shirt into the exact same place to print. And shirts stretch, so basically you wont unless you're lucky. This is in my rules. A client of mine asked me to change the dates on there T-Shirts from the previous year. I said no, they fought me on it. I still declined. They went somewhere else who said they'd do it. Client came back a few days later, asked me to make new Shirts completely. 

Anyway, to copy the design, I just put the T-Shirt flat down, try even it out and take a photo.
Then edit it on Photoshop. Obviously show the client first before you start making positives and the set up."
DontPanic,fmuy3bl,t1_fmuuji1,1586401485.0,Yeah. The Eion Colfer book just felt like it was written by a fan of the series. Good writing though. Just not right. I was happy to read it but would never consider it the final book. Mostly Harmless was a way better ending.
FutureMan,fmosvh0,t1_fmllbqn,1586267773.0,"I think there future's are undecided. Like the ending of back to the future doc says your future is whatever you make it. Seeing all the stuff they went through. There future's will have a different outcome.

TShirts,fm7invd,t3_ft9eng,1585828324.0,Is it not just screen printing you're seeing? Transfer can be cut thin as well with a cutter and weeded. But I would never go to thin. With thin type I always use screen printing.  It could be sublimation as well or Direct to Garment.

dating_advice,flqc3fo,t3_fq98b2,1585388271.0,"In sorry life put the odds against you in this department.  I was watching a show recently and apparently there is a dating website for micro penises. As someone stated in a comment,  guys with bigger members tend to not care as much if the woman organisms or has any pleasure. (Also might not be true) So the idea is that if its smaller the dude puts more effort in. Or something like that.
This might be perfect for you."

dating_advice,fkzvbgv,t3_flfu8i,1584681492.0,"Yeah. This is true. People need to stop saying this. I know it's to make the other person feel better but its doesn't. 
My one friend is 32. Never had a girlfriend. Never actually had sex. Hes messed around a bit. But that's it.
This is the thing that always gets said to him. I've even said it to him. But not anymore. 
I told him last time we were talking to do something about it.
He said he does and I said well do something else.
I know its cheesy but I told him I'd help him change his Tinder bio. Take nice photos. Get new clothes. 
It sounds mean but he needs it.
The person that you are is probably a great person but first impressions are pretty important."

It's been 4 months for me but about 2 years of fighting to keep it going. She was pulling away for a while before we broke up. I finally started the process of letting go. Which is just as painful as the breakup."

SCREENPRINTING,fka0rhk,t1_fk8t5ct,1583988656.0,I do 50% Deposit as well. I find that if a client puts in half they are most likely going to follow through with there order as they already put in the 50% and would then be at a loss. I've been doing this for over 10 years and have only had a few clients disappear after paying the deposit. Then I just sell what I have.

All I know is life is too short to hold grudges. If someone wants to be in your life then that's great.
But that's just my opinion and your opinion is completely valid as well."
