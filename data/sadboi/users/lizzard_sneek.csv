AskReddit,foq50dr,t3_g88ccd,1587983228.0,"Not me but a friend of mine- the country that we live in has a lot of minor earthquakes, usually about a 3-4 on the Richer Scale because there’s a tectonic plate in the area. When my friend was pretty young, I think about 10 or 11 years old, her parents had to go to the store really quick and she was left home alone. It was only supposed to take half an hour to get there, but the stuff and come back, but during that half hour the biggest earthquake that our country has had recently happened. It was an 8.0 magnitude earthquake, long (2 minutes) and it was strong, the city nearest to the epicenter had 85% of its buildings destroyed. My friend is deadly scared of earthquakes and any kind of seismic activity since. She’s told me that the thing that stayed with her the most is how her house had a sort of hanging light fixture (think chandelier but less fancy) in the living room and when the strongest part of the earthquake hit she was nearby (she had been rushing to get to the door) and it fell exploded all over the floor. She ended up with a few cuts from the fallen lights and windows that blew out but the lasting damage was the psychological part, every time a tremor or small earthquake happens she just freezes up and sometimes starts panicking :("

It might be because you were raised in a homophobic environment or a similar situation and it sadly affects a large portion of the LGBT+ community. What I would recommend is for you to investigate on the internet and once you feel comfortable with yourself and your feelings (and of course, if you like the girl back), you go out with the girl that asked you on a date.

Last year we were having tons of small ones so paranoia that it was all leading up to a repeat of the 1978 earthquake was high. One night at about 3 AM, I was sleeping (as one does at 3AM) and I feel my bed start shaking really hard, my first thought was “shit here it is” and I started to panic because all I could feel was my bed trembling and what I thought was the sound of an earthquake and my windowpanes shaking. This all happened in like 3 seconds so I jump out of bed in a blind panic and I see my cat on the corner of the bed scratching herself. She was scratching so hard that she was actually moving the bed and the sound I thought was my windowpanes shaking was the sound of the bell she had on her collar. Still couldn’t go back to sleep after that tho. It’s been almost a year, my cat passed away earlier this year and we still haven’t had the big earthquake everyone swore that was coming, still one of the scariest things I’ve ever experienced in my life."
